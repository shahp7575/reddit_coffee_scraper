He literally runs everywhere (despite me asking him to walk in certain situations) and as a result when he falls, he falls super hard. And he just trips over his own feet. 

So far for big falls he has:
- fallen off our concrete front step and scraped his nose and mouth 
- did the above again but got an entirely black and blue nose 
- came running toward me full force as I was sitting on a park bench at the park and somehow tripped and smacked his chin and mouth on the bench. So lucky he still has all his teeth. 
- hit our coffee table (my fault bec he kept ripping off the safety bumpers so I gave up putting them back) well 4 stitches later to his forehead on that one...
- was running, tripped and hit our bedframe and has a giant black and blue goose egg

I wish I could say that I don’t care if you guys read this, but deep down I want you to read this because I want you to know how pathetic you guys are, but I shouldn’t want that because I’m tired of feeling like I have to prove that you guys are wrong. I shouldn’t have to live my life trying to shove proof of things to people when at the end of the day I shouldn’t give a fuck what you guys think. So frankly, I don’t care if you guys ever read this, because I swear that from this day none of you get a word from me. You all stopped being my family because you chose to be horrible people.
Lets start with my uncle. 
You were never supposed to be here in my home in the first place. After my mother worked her ass off and spent so much money to get your ass into the country, what do you do in return for her? You spend all your days proving how worthless you are. You refused to get a job for months and months living completely free here in my mothers home and spent all your days playing shitty games on your phone and gambling away all the money you milked off my grandmother. Shit, the only times you even bothered to try to fill out a job application you didn’t even do it yourself, you sat me down and told me to fill out all of them for you. Im not even an adult yet and still im sitting here doing everything you should be? Do you even know the words that come out of your mouth after you spend the entire night drinking off countless bottles of beer? You sit here and yell at my mother, your own sister, telling her she’s worthless, calling her hundreds of things I cant even repeat, when you cant even walk properly from drinking all the alcohol that you didn’t pay for. You say she’s worthless, but do you realize that everyday when you wake up and drink your morning cup of coffee, youre drinking coffee, that you didn’t pay for, milk, that you also didn’t pay for, and from a cup, which you didn’t spend a cent on. Or to make it better, youre doing all this while sitting under the roof that you don’t contribute shit to. Actually you probably dont even notice any of this because its not like you even make your own coffee, youre a 36 year old man and have your mommy make your coffee and breakfast and do your dishes and wash and fold your clothes. To my stupid fucking aunts who defend this deadbeat, do you know how many nights I stay up until the early morning because this man is outside blasting music and smashing alcohol bottles on the road for hours past midnight. You guys dont even have the right to say anything because you aren’t the ones living through it. You just sit from afar and state your useless opinion and say “aw but poor him you don’t understand he has alot going on.” Do you have any idea how hard i cried when i saw this man ready to beat my mother to the ground after yelling at his own mother telling her to go ahead and kill herself, the same mother who does absolutely everything for him. And sometimes i tell myself fuck her too for continuesly putting all of us through this absolutely knowing how violent he is. Fuck all of you. Since the day I got diagnosed with PTSD from the past i never thought it would drive me to a point where i felt like i was going insane all over again, not until i saw just how scared i was of men like him, how i saw their faces everywhere i went. 
I remember how I used to love you all when I was little because i was so blind to the kind of people you actually were. To my aunt, how could you call my mother and belittle her and believe all the lies he says after literally listening to him tell his mom to bleed out to death all because she didn’t have more money to give him? To my other aunt, how could you defend all his actions and call my mother a snake just because you feel bad for him since you guys grew up together? You dont get to pick and choose just because you like someone better because if a man yelled at you like that youd be calling the cops right away. To the rest of my family, how could you treat us like criminals just because we dont wanna deal with you all. To my great grandmother, I hope you know being old doesn’t excuse being a shitty person. To my mother, thank you for working your ass off to protect your children and not giving a fuck what everyone else has to say if it means keeping your kids in a safe home. You have worked day and night for years to get me and my brother out of all situations we used to live through, and for that ill always be thankful. To my brother, my uncle german, my aunt adriana, my little cousins, and only some other uncles and aunts, you all are my light and the only family I truly have. To my other aunts, uncles, even older cousins, you know who you guys are, you have spent my whole life milking money out of everyone around you, spreading lies about my real family, making every day impossible. Our time together has been horrible, so from this day, let us never meet again. ",2,1735957939.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

1ht458b,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1ht458b/confused_about_a_girl/,Confused about a girl,"Ive been having some major confusion over what this girl thinks of me and need some exterior perspectives. So for context: Just turned 18, about a month ago i saw this gorgeous girl at a bar and had to ask for her socials, which to my suprise she gave me. I then texted her a bit and she wasnt dry at all but wasnt keepin the convo going. At this point my plan was to not text her and just ask her out when I finished my exams. About a week later she actually asked me out which suprised me and we went on the first date which i organised cause she fell sick a bit. It was the first date ive ever been on but luckily it went pretty well, i picked her up in my car, brought her to thr city for coffee, wasnt awkward and she had a great personality, exactly my type. This is where the main issue became noticeable. The issue thats had me on the fence is that shes never texted me, ever. Aside from asking me out, and even after multiple conversations ive started she has never texted me first. Again, like i said before, when i do start a convo shes never dry, replies fast and talks but if i dont start a convo she never will. So then i thought ok maybe she wasnt interested but when i asked her out for the second date she said yes. Today was the 2nd date and again, it went great,  took her out to a nice resto which she rlly liked, tried complimenting her more this time and she said some nice things abt me to. But just like before, after the date nothing, no text or anytning. I had to text her the basic old ""i had a good time etc..."" She told me after i asked her that shed lmk when shes free but i have a deep down feeling she wont. So, basically my question is, seeing how shes also down to hangout and seems interested but that she never texts me, what does this mean. ",1,1735957741.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

1ht434z,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1ht434z/i_m31_am_involved_in_an_emotional_affair_with_a/,I [M31] am involved in an emotional affair with a married [F33] woman. ,"About three months ago my team gained a new member who we will call Janice. Janice joined the team with all kinds of zeal and energy, obviously intelligent, driven, and gorgeous. She and I talked some, but to be honest despite the obviously attractive woman I wasnt myself particularly attracted. There were comments by my more outspoken team members of course but mostly I just reminded them that Janice was married and they were gross for the kinds of comments made. Janice however was assigned to my area, and I was charged with her training. 

She shared that she and her husband had moved recently, that she had lost her entire social circle, and that she was looking for people to fill her circle again. I shared that my circle was pretty tight knit, a solid 4, sometimes 5, who gamed frequently, went out to drink occasionally, and were generally pretty open to anyone. So, she opted to join us for some online games, at first this was infrequent but as time went on she began gaming nearly daily. During this time I would make fun of her for acting a bit “boujee” compared to the rest of us, which did seem to upset her so I clarified one day that I was joking, and that I would stop. I further shared some of my past experiences in various ghettos to help her get why some of her, very normal, habits may seem a bit “boujee”. 

Things came to a head when she hit me out of no where with “ThrowAway, I need you to be honest. Do you have a crush on me? You opened up in a way most guys don’t unless they are romantically interested and I am not sure I am comfortable with that. I need to focus on my daughter and husband. This is so awkward if I misread things.” And I told her no, which at the time was true enough, that I had seen enough relationships in my life to be pretty comfortable in my being single. I have my son to tend to, college courses, and no energy, time or inclination really to be crushing on anyone, let alone a married woman. I concluded by telling her that I am very forward when I do have feelings, and I promise to tell her if this changes. She accepted this answer and life went on. 

We continued to game and work, however a couple of weeks later she hits me out of no where again, informing me that she thinks she herself has developed a crush. Stating that, perhaps a bit “counterintuitively” my not having had a crush has perhaps caused her to develop one but she isn’t sure. She asked if she made it awkward and told me that if I wanted to stop contact she understood. I told her I didn’t have feelings but it was flattering if anything and I would be just fine. We played some more games that night, but I did get to thinking. I hadn’t let myself crush on someone since my son’s mother and I had split. I’ve been single fathering and hadn’t given myself the time or room to recover from that really, and wondered if I had been displaying signs of crushing on this woman to begin with. It was the next day that I concluded I had been treating her at least a little differently than I do most people, I was more comfortable around her than most people, and perhaps I had developed a crush. So, as promised, I shared this with her. 

This is where things should have ended, contact cut, but they didn’t. Instead, we began spending more time together. She shared that her husband was emotionally unintelligent, unable to share his feelings with her. That his love languages were gifts and acts of service, while hers were quality time, reassurance and touch. She also shared that they rushed into the marriage, having been together for a short time before Covid hit, which happened to be when her lease was up, so she moved in with him and had a kid not long later. She shared her frustrations with his lack of sharing with her, stating he started going to therapy without ever telling her, and refused to tell her if it was helping him at all, while also refusing marriage therapy with her. 

She and I flirted some, but mostly kept our feelings locked down for a time. A day came however when she went to lunch with her husband, after telling him that she doesn’t think their marriage “has the legs to make it” if they don’t go to therapy together, he finally looked into love languages. She said she was excited about this, incredibly happy, but when she said as much to him he said “I had to, or you would take half my money and my house.” 

I felt for her, I was trying to be there for her, but being there for her with the feelings we have was the wrong call. We grew a lot closer for the next few weeks. Eventually the flirting hit a high, we started being far more open about our feelings, we began having lunches together, getting coffee together, little dates really. Then we went to a Christmas party together and that is where it evolved. There we played games, talked, and after I gave her a hug before driving home. She called me while we drove though, and on the way we talked about how it was obvious we had feelings. We talked about how good it felt to be around each other and she gave me “I wish you had hugged me longer. It’s been less than an hour and I miss you. I think I am in trouble.” 

Less than a week later, we discussed our feelings and I told her that I think I may love her. She reciprocated. She struggled with this for a day, but since then we have been open about that as well. We’ve begun hitting the gym together, we text daily, spend time on the phone, and generally enjoy one another’s company. We drew a hard line on physical interactions beyond hugs, but it hasn’t seemed to matter emotionally. 

This last weekend she told her husband that she want to go to marriage therapy. She has been telling me that she needs to give her marriage a real shot at being fixed. I am supporting her in this, honestly, if that is the path she needs to take to be happy then I am happy for her. We also discussed where we stand though, and neither of us are willing to let the other go. We want to make the core friendship work but it’s hard not to slip into these habits. It’s hard to let some of these habits go. Today she told me that she needs to stop telling me that she loves me. This is maybe the most painful thing she has asked so far. I asked if she did, and she said yes, but every time she says it, it is a small betrayal of her marriage. She said that her husband freaked out, had a melt down about marriage therapy, saying it wouldn’t help and he doesn’t want her to see things that would make her leave, and she wants to lead by example, being honest with him so he can be honest with her but she can’t do that with us being the way we are. 

She asked to talk more tonight, which we will do. But she openly recognized for the first time that this is an emotional affair. That’s where we are now. ",2,1735957560.0,confessions,0,1.0,False

Been working at a coffee shop since before transition bc coffee shops where I live employ a ton of queer people.

So, that means regulars are watching me transition in real-time. I am to the point where I pass as a cis guy, and I was bracing for people to start saying things to my face.

But, so far, most regulars have just taken it in stride. The only one who still misgenders me is this 80 year old guy who's still nice to me, regardless. I did have one regular comment on my new name and scoff, and insult the fact that I cut my hair off. But he's since started treating me normally again. I do get some icy looks from some people but no comments yet. And a few surprised looks from people who come weekly, but hadn't heard my voice bc I hadn't personally taken their order in a while.

I'm still wary that there's going to be someone who has a problem enough to say something. And I suspect that the main reason I haven't faced direct harassment is bc I'm not a trans woman, so transmisogyny isn't really at play.

I have had a couple shitty transphobic coworkers, but they were both fired for unrelated reasons (ironically, not only were they both transphobic, they were just generally not great people who caused other issues). I expected to encounter more direct transphobia than I have.

1ht3zo6,https://i.redd.it/25rqnj360wae1.jpeg,As a Mexican… did I do okay lol?,"Made everything by scratch except the kimchi /.\


Tried making pork bossam, but it came out a bit too moist and soft. I feel like it should have been firmer—does that sound right?

Next time, I want to try sautéing it first with oil and salt before boiling. Also, instead of coffee, I’m thinking of using Coca-Cola. It might lean more toward carnitas than traditional bossam, but hey, worth a shot! I’ll test it out next week.

Ingredients I Used for the Pork:
	•	Doenjang
	•	½ onion
	•	10 cloves of garlic
	•	½ piece of ginger
	•	Green onion
	•	Water
	•	Nescafé instant coffee
	•	Brown sugar
	•	Salt
	•	Green jalapeño
	•	Bay leaves

For the lettuce, I pickled it with water, vinegar, salt, and sugar.

Thoughts on the Ssamjang:

It turned out soooo good! Just a little too salty, so I added mirin. I also considered adding sugar but worried it might turn out grainy.

Things I’ll Do Differently Next Time:
	•	Cut the lettuce smaller—it was too big, making it hard to do the classic one-bite wrap (or maybe I’m just weak, lol).

Would love to hear any tips or suggestions! Anyone tried using Coke instead of coffee before?",11,1735957249.0,KoreanFood,3,0.92,False

For context, Im 38 with no kids yet. It’s been well over 5 years since Ive been in a serious relationship or dated anyone longer than 6 months. After past relationships going sour quick, Ive sort of fell back until I meet someone worth giving my attention to. Welllllllll I decided to try Hinge again. Instantly matched with a great, handsome, well put together man and he invited me for coffee this evening. The chemistry was amazing! After we parted ways, I couldn’t stop smiling thinking about him……then BOOM. Here comes that nappy headed whore named SELF-SABOTAGE. Started thinking “what if he’s like the rest of the guys Ive dated” and “what if he doesnt really like me and will unmatch and block me soon as we leave” (which he texted me 5 minutes after we left saying how much he enjoyed it) and even the “its been so long since Ive dated anyone, what if I run out of things to talk about” 🥴

Story 5: The Battle of the Broadsword

Captain’s Log, Stardate… I don’t know, Tuesday?

So, get this: we’re cruising through Sector 17, minding our own business, when a bunch of intergalactic cephalopod losers decide to try and ruin my day. Space pirates. Ugly, slimy, tentacled, and unlucky. They picked the wrong ship to mess with—my ship.

Let me set the scene for you. We’re on the UHS Broadsword—top-notch human engineering, baby. Sure, the engine rattles when we hit warp, and the coffee maker has been on strike since last month, but it’s still a beauty. I’m Captain Derrick ""The Baconator"" Carmichael, by the way. Yeah, that’s right—the Derrick Carmichael. The guy who single-handedly made first contact with the Grumboxians and got them hooked on bacon cheeseburgers. So yeah, I’m kind of a big deal.

Anyway, these space pirates pop up on our radar. Their ship? A rust bucket held together with duct tape and bad decisions. Their captain? Some overcompensating squid named Glo’tar The Merciless. Real original. He hails us and goes, “Surrender your ship and cargo, or face annihilation!”

Annihilation? Us? I actually laughed. Out loud.

""And who are you supposed to be? Squidward's uglier brother? Look buddy, if I surrendered every time some tentacle-waving wannabe threatened me, I wouldn't still have a ship. Get lost.” 

He didn’t like that.

They start charging weapons, and my crew looks at me like, “What’s the plan, Captain?” The plan? Oh, the plan was to show these slimy punks exactly why humans are the galaxy’s most unbeatable species.

First move? Comms warfare. We hacked their ship’s intercom system and began broadcasting The Worst Sound Ever Created by Humans™. What’s that, you ask? The audio mashup of a thousand crying babies, dental drills, and bagpipes being played by a pack of drunken cats. We looped it, of course, and within moments, we had pirates banging their heads against the walls and abandoning posts just to make it stop.

Meanwhile, Jenkins, my tactical officer, whipped out Plan B: the Glitter Bomb Fleet Special. That’s right. We launched a payload of high-density glitter canisters directly into their air filtration system. Within seconds, their ship was a sparkling hellscape. Pirates were choking on glitter, slipping on glitter, getting glitter in places no being should ever have glitter. Glo’tar was screaming, “What is this madness?!” Spoiler alert: glitter doesn’t come off. Ever.

Then things got really fun.

The pirates launched boarding pods, figuring brute force was their best shot. Rookie mistake. We waited until their pods docked and then rerouted all the sewage waste from Deck 7 directly into the corridors they were coming through. The second they opened their pod doors? BAM! A tidal wave of bio-waste. You’ve never seen aliens retreat faster in your life.

But a few managed to get onboard. When they stormed the bridge, we hit them with another classic human tactic: unrelenting sarcasm. One pirate bellowed, “Your ship is now property of the Glo’tar Fleet!” 

I replied, “Oh no, not my beloved garbage heap with the broken coffee maker. However will I go on?” Ramirez actually handed one of them a mop and said, “Congrats, you’re captain now. Better start cleaning.”

I almost lost my cool at the dumbfounded expression of the cephalopod's face, but I managed to stop myself from falling over in a fit of laughter when Glo’tar himself finally stormed onto the bridge, dripping glitter and sewage. He roared, “Do you fools have any idea who you’re dealing with?”

“Yeah, a dude who’s about to spend the rest of his life picking glitter out of his crevices.”

By this point, they were done. Half their crew was still incapacitated by the sound loop; the rest were choking on glitter and the ones who made it aboard were wishing they’d chosen literally any other profession. Glo’tar tried to make a last stand, but Jenkins hit him with a stun baton yelling, “This is what happens when you mess with the Broadsword, sucker.”

We herded the pirates back to their pods, slapped a “Kick Me” sign on Glo'tar's back for good measure, and sent them limping back to whatever cesspool they crawled out of. No casualties on our side, unless you count my dignity when I accidentally tripped over a mop bucket during the scuffle.

So, yeah, we totally wrecked them, bro. No big deal. Just another day in the life of The Baconator and the Broadsword. You’re welcome, galaxy.

Captain’s Note: Next time, we’re not using the sewage system as a weapon, unless absolutely necessary. Victory may be sweet, but it sure smells like ass.

### Episode Title: ""The Holloway Haunting""

#### **Opening Scene:**
*Camera opens on an eerie mansion at dusk. Lightning strikes in the distance. The wind howls. A large, decaying sign reads: “Holloway Mansion – Haunted Since 1882.”*

**Host 1 (Max):** ""Welcome to *Ghost Myth Busters,* the only show where we take a scientific approach to your supernatural fears.""

**Host 2 (Eliza):** ""That’s right, Max. And tonight, we’re investigating one of the most famous haunted locations in the region—Holloway Mansion. For over a century, locals have reported seeing ghostly apparitions, hearing unexplainable whispers, and even feeling cold spots that defy explanation.""

**Max (gesturing to the mansion):** ""Sounds like prime ghost territory to me. But we’re here to get to the bottom of it. Are these phenomena the work of restless spirits, or is there a more logical explanation?""

*They both turn toward the entrance, and the door creaks open as if by itself.*

**Eliza:** ""Let’s find out.""

---

#### **Scene 1: The Investigation Begins**
*The hosts walk into the mansion, and the camera follows them as they explore various spooky elements.*

**Max (looking around):** ""First, we’ve got reports of cold spots throughout the mansion. Now, this is a classic indicator of paranormal activity, but can we explain it scientifically?""

*They head toward a room where the temperature appears to drop dramatically. Max holds up a digital thermometer.*

**Max:** ""According to this reading, the temperature dropped 15 degrees in a matter of seconds. Some say this could be the presence of a ghost, but we’ve got a little something for that.""

*Eliza pulls out a portable heater and a fan from their bags.*

**Eliza (smiling):** ""Just a little push from old HVAC science.""

*Max places the heater on the floor and points the fan at the wall, demonstrating how an air conditioning vent in the room could be causing the rapid temperature change.*

**Max (proudly):** ""So, not a ghost. Just bad air circulation and some unlucky airflow patterns.""

**Eliza (nodding):** ""Myth *busted.*""

---

#### **Scene 2: The Portrait Eyes That Follow**
*The camera pans to a large, haunting portrait of a woman hanging in the foyer.*

**Max (reading from the clipboard):** ""Next, there’s the famous portrait of Mrs. Holloway, who is said to... well, *stare* at you as you walk by. People say her eyes follow them wherever they go. Let’s see if we can get to the bottom of this one.""

*Max and Eliza approach the portrait. Eliza steps in front of it while Max pulls out a protractor.*

**Eliza (staring at the painting):** ""Okay, I admit, I’m kind of creeped out by this.""

**Max (smirking):** ""Not so fast. Let’s get our angles right, shall we?""

*He uses the protractor to measure the angle of the portrait relative to Eliza’s position, revealing that the painting’s eyes are positioned in such a way that they give the illusion of following the viewer around.*

**Max (grinning):** ""Busted. It’s all about perspective and lighting. Nothing supernatural about this.""

**Eliza (laughing):** ""Just an optical illusion. Mrs. Holloway isn’t watching you. At least, not in the way you thought.""

---

#### **Scene 3: The Unexplained Phenomena**
*As Max and Eliza walk deeper into the mansion, strange things begin to happen. Lights flicker. A chair in the corner starts to rock by itself. Suddenly, objects begin levitating off the shelves.*

**Max (looking around, startled):** ""Okay, this is... um, electromagnetic fields.""

**Eliza (frowning):** ""Uh, that’s not supposed to happen. So, what’s causing this? Something else?""

*They both look at a vase that begins to float in mid-air.* 

**Eliza:** ""I don’t know, Max. But the science on this one is... well, we don’t know. There’s no easy explanation for this kind of phenomenon.""

*The objects continue to levitate and float toward them. Max and Eliza look at each other.*

**Max (deflecting):** ""You know, sometimes in nature, objects just... magnetize. Sometimes the universe throws us a curveball. This could be magnetic.""

**Eliza (half-joking):** ""It’s like a ghostly flash mob. No idea yet what’s going on, but it sure looks impressive.""

*Max shrugs, clearly avoiding the topic.*

**Max:** ""Yeah. No ghost here. It’s just... electromagnetic fields playing tricks on us, or something.""

---

#### **Scene 4: The Big Reveal**
*They finish their tour of the mansion, and the camera cuts to them standing at the front door. The objects are still floating in the background, the air thick with suspense.*

**Max:** ""So, we’ve busted the temperature drop myth and the ghostly portrait myth.""

**Eliza (smiling, but unsure):** ""Yeah, but... uh, what’s with all the levitating stuff?""

**Max (grinning):** ""It’s fine, Eliza. Let’s grab some coffee. We’ll talk about it later. No ghosts. Just... something else. But that’s the beauty of *Ghost Myth Busters*.""

*The camera zooms in on Max and Eliza as they casually walk off-screen. The objects continue to float eerily behind them.*

**Eliza (calling off-screen):** ""But what about—""

**Max (off-screen):** ""I said it's fine, Eliza.""

*Cue dramatic music as the scene ends, leaving the audience to wonder what *really* happened.*

My fiancée and I are planning on taking our first trip over to the Emerald Isle at the end of March and we’re looking to finalize our air travel and base itinerary.

We’ll be traveling without a car, so anything would need to be accessible by foot, bike, public transit, or tours. How does the following sound so far:

Day 1: Arrive in Dublin early morning, Guinness tour, Trinity College old library (is the Book of Kells worth it?), enjoy the night

Day 2: Day tour to Belfast and Giant’s Causeway, back in Dublin for the night

Day 3: Train to Cork, check out St. Anne’s, English Market, the Lough

Day 4: Bus to Kinsale for the Scilly Walk, lunch, bus back to Cork for the night

Day 5: Train the Killarney for the day, hop on hop off bus for a few sites (Torc Waterfall, Muckross House)

Day 6: Day tour around the Ring of Kerry

Days 7-9: ???

Day 10: Fly back from Dublin

Under the Stars 9.7/10 - My favorite by far, it introduced me to leather/oud in perfumes. I know people hate it, but something about this perfume consumes me. It reminds me of painting on a rainy night in my old art studio. A candle or two lit for mood, my leather boots/sandals are wet. The whole studios smells faintly like leather, and of the spicy tacos from hours earlier. This perfume makes me feel like the night is young and full of possibilities. I have tried Zoologist’s Hydrax, and this smells a lot like the dry down, sans animal funk. 9.7

Funfair Evening – 9.5/10 I did not like this weird smell at all at first. The more I smell it, the more I enjoy it. I think it confused me, like is this a gourmand? But the spices in it reminds me of meat dishes. It’s like a delicious meal with something salty/savory and sweet at the end. It’s really fun without being smelling cheap. Lasts pretty long too. I’m now freaking out wondering what I will do when I run out. Does anyone know of a dupe? Why is this so good? 9.5

Lipstick On – 9.4/10 I did not think I would like this smell so much, but this smell was soooo interesting. I think of pin-ups, 1950s Hollywood, as it smells just like old school beauty products. I’m transported to when I was a child in the 90’s, and smelling mom’s lipstick for the first time. Her nightstand with all her womanly things. It just reminds me of going through my mom’s stuff as a kid so much. Love. I understand why people are dying to get a bottle of this, it’s very unique, femme, and dreamy. I think if you look all over the internet, you can find some ok priced ones. They’ve canceled a good one. 9.4

By the Fire place 9.4/10 – I’ve resisted this because of the hype, but this is such a beautiful, intriguing fragrance. I am pretty in awe of it. It pairs well with other perfumes, and gives you that cozy feeling of smelling your hair after being near a fire. It's a very comforting smell that I can reach for in most moods. I really did not want to like it, but it smells so good - and slowly won me over. 9.4

Matcha Medication 9.1/10 - Very interesting combo of green tea and white chocolate that melts me into a puddle. I can wear this for any occasion and feel appropriate. I like gourmands that come with a drink in it's smell profile. 9.1/

Coffee Break 9.0/10 – I did not like this at all at first. Something happened this winter, I’ve found myself feeling super cozy in this. It slowly grew on me, until it became a stable in my winter rotation. I’m very pleased this one is active, so I can repurchase if I run out.  9.0

 

 

 

Great:

At the Barbers 8.9/10 – The opening is very much an “Aftershave” kind of smell. It then evolves into coffee break but with manly notes like leather and rosemary. I don’t smell any moss until hours later. It smells a lot like coffee break during the drying process but I would not call this a gourmand. It’s a freshie that’s gourmand-curious. 8.9

Autumn Vibes 8.9/10 – Autumn Vibes succeeded where Soul of the Forest failed me. I’m getting the super large hit of the moss that I want and desire. I’ve made perfumes for myself where the smell is mostly just moss, and this reminds me of it. I’m transported to a New England waterfall full of ferns and mosses sits between large glacial rocks covered in lichen and pillow moss. In the spring and summer it’s covered in flowers. This time of the year, bright red maple leaves form and some fall onto the water. The surround trees are mostly cedar, pine, and maple. I take my final dip via jumping off the cliff/glacial boulders. I climb out using this large flat rock, and as I climb out, I smell the rock with moss and mini ferns attached for a second. This smell is that exact moment. 8.9

From the Garden 8.8/10 - Interesting scent that I just love. The tomato accord is edgy, but something about the citrus and flowery smell brings it back to earth. Super wearable for me in the spring and summer. Best tomato-inspired perfume I’ve smelled. 8.8

Dancing on the Moon 8.5/10 – Without a doubt the best of the Fantasies collection for me. Ohhh how I love this jasmine/mineral goodness. I’m about to buy a second bottle. It’s so wearable I genuinely feel like I’m in an art gallery every time I wear it. The other ones are good but this one is simply divine. 8.5

Wicked Love 7.9/10 - It smells like a rose in peak bloom was put inside a green bell pepper that's been sliced in half, inside a metal box. I have no idea why this weird spicy smell is interesting to me but I like it when I am feeling spicy. 7.9

Soul of the Forest 7.8/10 - This perfume smells like what I make for myself but with Patchouli and other notes that makes it more complex. I like both my own simple cedar and oak moss mixture and this perfume, but this one smells more like a perfume. I really like this smell, but feel like it’s missing something and have to layer it. It lasts forever, and smells more like a pine forest than an actual pine forest. Heavy in tree-smells. 7.8

Across Sands 7.8/10 - A mysterious scent that's heavy in dates, very sweet. It does make my nose feel dry, like there a small sand storm swept through. 7.8

Tea Escape 7.8/10 – Beautiful blend of tea and flowers. The bottle is really old, the top notes have been damaged by time, otherwise this would be 9.0+. I wait for spoiled top notes to evaporate, only then  can I detect a heavy tea smell with citrus and floras. The floras near disappear, and I’m just left with heavy heavy trail of tea and sweet, spicy, citrus. It’s actually super nice and I would score it 9.0+ with a better opening. Whatever went bad thankfully evaporates super fast and the dry down is amazing. It changes and lasts hours. I’m not shocked people are selling even older bottles (10+ years) for 300-500 dollars. This perfume does hold up, and the perfection zone is any time after 5 mins from spraying. I’ve caught myself smelling my skin 4-5 hours after spraying. I’ve managed to find a cheap, young(ish) bottle, but I would advise against purchasing this one as at least 70% of the bottles I’ve seen for sale were obviously fakes. 7.8

Jazz Club – 7.5/10 The leather note is super nice, and I love the manly smells that are at play. I thought the rum note was too strong personally. I can smell lots herbs. I do love this smell, but it is not in the favorite club. 7.5

 

 

The Rest:

Whispers in the Library 6.9/10 - Good, interesting that it does indeed smell like old paper. 6.9

Promenade in the Gardens 6.9/10 – I enjoyed flowery smells like this more in my 20’s and teenage years, now in my 30’s, I still reach for them in the summer time, but I find them less and less appeling. It’s nice and a pretty girly smell, a good choice for going out and inoffensive. I would wear this to church. 6.9

Beach Walk 6.9/10 - I've enjoyed this smell more than I thought I would. Smells like I've fallen asleep in the sun and woke up smelling the SPF40 lotion on my skin. 6.9

Bubble Bath 6.8/10 - A good smell that smells like fancy hotels to me. It's that smell I get when I dive into a newly made hotel bed. 6.8

Flower Market 6.8/10 - Pleasant smell, a cacophony of various flowers. It’s inoffensive. It’s like a loud British perfume.  6.8

When the Rain Stops 6.5/10 - Good smell, but I don't love it. 6.5             

Under the Lemon Tree 4.9/10 - It smells like lemons, but lacks sophistication/personality. I don't smell the other background stuff enough, the synthetic lemon kind of over powers everything for me. In the dry down, I smell tea, which is nice, and the only redeeming quality of this perfume in my opinion. I would score this much higher if the tea smell was nicer or complimented the lemon better. 4.9

Lazy Sunday Morning 4.9/10 – It’s nice, but very generic. I forgot about it as soon as I’ve tried it. It was like lazy bubble bath. I can see people who just want to smell like clean laundry wear this. It's very work safe. 4.9

Music Festival 4.9/10 - The opposite of work safe. I don't mind weed as a smell or for consumption, but this smell was not enjoyable for me. Tried SO hard to like this smell, it just never delivers enough pleasant feelings. I gave them (had several minis) to my hippy girl friends and they both love this smell. 4.9

Springtime in a Park 4.5/10 – Meh, some what flowery, I like cherry blossoms, but I feel like there are so many other better cherry blossom perfumes out there. This one was mostly a waste of time. 4.5

Afternoon Delight 4.4/10 – I appreciate it, but it’s too photo-realistic for me in terms of wanting to eat a french cookie. Some people wanna smell like a snack, I get it. I didn’t think it was for me. 4.4

On a Date 4.4/10 – I’m genuinely surprised people want to smell like this at this price point. I almost refuse to buy this because it performed so poorly in my opinion. It’s not terrible, but there are several notes that lingered for hours that I did not appreciate. The whole combo was off for me. 4.4

Context: mag one year na kami ng bf this year. I found out last year july na nagka hookup sila ng best friend nyang babae like months before me and him happened (more like ONS pala kasi one time lang naman nangyari). We visited the girl's coffee shop last year july din tas may boundaries naman sila and the girl is all smiles when i was introduced by my bf and i found out din na binlock ni girl c bf ko. Parang casual nalang sila ba di na masyadong mag bespren turingan. I think you guys are asking na 2025 na bat di pa na solve. Nung new year, may gc kasi yan sila with the girl, di na masyadong nag iinteract c bf and c girl dun sa gc kase may mga kanya kanya na silang mga relasyon. Nag greet c bf ng hny dun sa gc tas ang sunod na chat is tinag nya c girl kase hinahanap nya. tas pagkabukas, he told me na namiss nya yung mga tao dun sa gc na yun tas pinag sasave nya mga photos nila as a group and may photo sila ni girl na c bf,  at c girl na may kargang bata. Tas he is saying na ""i miss them"" pero parang yung girl lang naman miss nya kase yung girl lang yung hinahanap nya. Parang di yata ako maka move on na nag ONS kayo ng girl best friend mo and yet you're still trying to reach out to her like nothing happened?

  
Previous Attempts: I talked to him nung July din. He explained to me na that was his hoe phase and they were drunk that time, nothing more, nothing less. Naging away sya kase parang nag iba paningin ko sa kanya? Parang na realize ko unti unti yung scope ng pagiging palai\*yot nya.

1ht3okm,https://v.redd.it/6hkmywe9xvae1,Update for those who helped me with Banana,"Warning: emotional post

Hello everyone, 
 
I’ve had Banana for the past 8 years. I adopted her from a guy named Mark who healed her bumblefoot and treated her for mites when he had rescued her from a breeder who didn’t treat their birds well. 

 

Banana’s right wing must have been damaged at the breeder because Mark told me he handled her so delicately he was shaking and quivering because he didn’t want to hurt her. (I did the same when I hold her, she’s so tiny!) 

Anyways, she has been such a loving little ball of energy to have in my life and so have learned so much about canaries after adopting her! I eventually got her a friend, a little gloster canary named Mango! 

They have been best friends ever since! Since then I hang out with “The Fruit” every morning with my coffee before work and love coming home to their little songs and cute little fly-by’s! 

In my last post about Banana, she had diarrhea. Many posters rushed to help me with suggestions, which was so helpful and gave me hope! Unfortunately, her  condition worsened so I quickly rushed her to the vet. 

They found out she has a tumor on her abdomen and is heavy with water weight from that. She hasn’t much time left really so they said give her all the treats she wants and make her warm and comfortable and give her flat perches to stand on so she can flatten out her feet and relax.  

Just posting a pic of her here to hopefully let all the posters know who reached out before that we tried 🥹🥲😭

So, for now Banana is on hospice care under my watch and gets to live her regular life until she is ready to move on. The vet said they may offer pain meds for later and they have specialized gas mask for tiny birds if it comes down to that she’s suffering badly. 

I am heartbroken thinking about that but heartbroken to think she is going to suffer like this. She has been my little shadow and really came to me at the lowest time in my life and changed it a lot, and I am so sad to hear this news today. With how crazy her life was before me, she doesn’t deserve this kind of an ending! 

Anyways, 💔 

Spend as much time as you can with the feathered ones you love ❤️ ",2,1735956318.0,Canaries,0,1.0,False

You were just a Walmart employee, silly, obsessed with hot wheels and causing trouble just to make those around you smile. 
You were annoying. But goofy. You stared. Curious. 
You put in the effort to befriend me in anyway possible. You were so infatuated you were even able to steal my heart from another. We stayed up late, no phones, just admiring one another and talking in the car. We went on adventures. We even raced each other irresponsibly on the streets. You were still quite annoying, but you really…nested in my heart. You grew on me. 

I wanted to give you everything. I wanted us to take care of each other. I wanted us to learn more and grow together. I was faithful. I was respectful. Responsible…honest and trustworthy… I gave even when I had nothing. I gave until it hurt. I bent in every way I could for you to the point of violation and disrespect for myself. But anything for you… anything and everything I could give. Just to see you smile. Just to hear that Chuckle. Just to have your attention. Anything to be touched. 

You started to drift away… where did I go wrong..?

Can you not see my wings busted and broken? My heart and mind shattered and tattered? Waiting… aching… yearning… bleeding…

I am not enough anymore. I am nothing. It is maddening. Drowning in work used to alleviate the pain of stagnation but now I am starved for love, attention, touch… growth. And I can’t even look so much as look another man’s way. You have my heart. You must be a devil, you must also have my soul.
I gave you space, and you betrayed my trust. 
I hate that I’ve given so much, and received so much hurt… 

But I will wait… I will hurt… anything to hear you laugh even if it means hurting me. Anything to see those cold blue eyes filled with love once more…

I will wait, for I can no longer fly anyway…

I am 29 years old and since I was 14 years old I have been suffering from atopic eczema. I read some posts here in which people have to take all kinds of different medications to suppress their flare-ups. However, with me my eczema is not so serious it is only limited to the eyelids hands, fingers and arms. When I have a flare up it can be very serious. I experience a huge brain fog even when I have no flair on it. I sleep very badly. I also have an allergy to dust mites and pollen. It's winter now and I don't sleep well because of the dust mite allergy, my doctor says. Getting up early is very difficult for me. The quality of my sleep is very low. I want to feel fresh again. When I read a book I can read an entire page, but I don't understand what it says. My studies have suffered below here I always didn't get up until late in the afternoon and didn't fall asleep until early in the morning. I also recently lost my job. I am 100% sure that my skin condition has to do with this. I often get to the desk late or forget important things just because I had a brain fog in my head.

Now the good news a few weeks ago I went on a trip to North Africa. After a day I felt reborn. I felt fresh and lively. I got up early in the morning to exercise. I slept like a baby and especially waking up with a cup of coffee made me happy. My skin also felt thicker as if an extra skin barrier was created. I am considering living and working in this country. I feel I can enjoy life more living here.

Lately, my skin condition has been well under control. I have special cortisone cremes with and to maintain my skin I smear prottopic. I also take Ebastine to sleep better. Yet I experience life as very tiring and I have little energy or motivation to do things. Its has a huge impact on my life. 

Does anybody feels the same? Do you also have brain fog without having flare ups?",2,1735955849.0,eczema,1,1.0,False
1ht3ipu,https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/1ht3ipu/how_to_create_a_floorplan_pokemon_style/,"How to create a floor-plan, Pokemon Style","Hello everyone, recently I shared my Pokemon floor-plan and the responses were incredible! **Thank you for that!**  
Many wanted to know how you would create a floor-plan like this. **I will try to explain this to you today.**

What you need / What you learn:  
\- Some design program - Gimp, [Paint.net](http://Paint.net), Adobe Photoshop, Affinity Photo, Photopea or similar  
\- The HomeAssistant picture-elements-card  
\- Uploading files to your HomeAssistant server  
\- Basic CSS - really basic I swear!

# Step 1 - Map your apartment

A good baseplan is helpful to create any kind of floor-plan. wether it is 2D or 3D (for ex. with My Home 3D) or like I did in the style of Pokemon.

Get a tape-measure and start mapping your rooms. **Start** with the **outside walls** and **move inwards**. You don't have to make it exact to the milimeter. (unless you want to)

**Don't forget details like windows or doors**. Maybe also measure your furniture for future reference.

I like to create a rough drawing on paper and fill out the measurements in there, I'm a visual kind guy.

[This is my Baseplan. It's way too detailed for what we will do, keep it simple!](https://preview.redd.it/q4vqprszzuae1.png?width=524&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef2d7490aeae3bc7ab058f68bbd0535d6ad8177e)

# Step 2 - Ready, set, tiles!

To create a Pokemon plan you need a **tileset**. A single tileset can **include hundreds of textures** within a single file.

I used **this tileset** from Archive.org:  
[https://archive.org/details/PokmonEssentialsV17.220171015](https://archive.org/details/PokmonEssentialsV17.220171015)

The downloaded .zip contains a lot more but we only need **.\\Graphics\\Tilesets**

[Example, inside tileset](https://preview.redd.it/l62kfxservae1.png?width=278&format=png&auto=webp&s=b94b27883f7cfd2e759aa7fb8ac75985393e4514)

Take a look at all files, some elements are repeated but many are unique to each area.  
**I used:** Outside, Interior general, Department store interior and boat.

# Step 3 - Start building

Start the graphics program of your choice. I use Photoshop.

\- Load your baseplan

\- in another window, open the first tileset for example **Interior general.png** (It's the most useful)

\- Copy your first object, I took these chairs. They are perfect to **get a sense of scale**.

\- Scale your baseplan to fit the furniture, **NEVER SCALE YOUR COPIED OBJECTS.**

https://preview.redd.it/z6f8s4zqrvae1.png?width=1221&format=png&auto=webp&s=278acb1bbfa445b27bf22f0756f148c072d6b611

Pokemon **isn't true to life**, furniture is larger than IRL so try to keep that in mind. Maybe check some screenshots from the game to get inspiration.

Keep scrolling through the first tileset and **start copy-pasting anything** that could be important. And take note of things you're missing, we might need to create them ourselves. If you're pro you **name everything as you go**. Make your life easy in the later stages.

https://preview.redd.it/x3mb52yrrvae1.png?width=1221&format=png&auto=webp&s=f94201a31523421a45aa9a323bfbe821a31ae9e2

# Step 4 - Custom tiles

Right we are **missing a few things!** I will show you how I created my L-Sofa out of existing tiles.

**Important sidenote:**  
Everything in this tileset is **made up of 2x2** pixels. If you want everything to feel right and look OG keep that in mind and move everything by 2px or paint in 2x2px blocks.

https://preview.redd.it/pve7fc2yrvae1.png?width=1221&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7722b97848c345b7f45050fb94b503c86c935b3

I copied these to sofas and copied them on top of each other.

https://preview.redd.it/n0w0hrp0svae1.png?width=298&format=png&auto=webp&s=29e5c6d403fb9abf9d74e52ca4a640386d809a91

**Remove the left arm rest** using a 2px wide hard brush (pencil in Photoshop or Gimp works even better)  
and remove the complete **right side** since we don't need that.

https://preview.redd.it/c3doea63svae1.png?width=152&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b0b4b306378c4c3c185a1abd6adecd81458bb56

We s**plit the sofa** to make it a bit longer, and then c**onnect it using the pencil tool.**

https://preview.redd.it/zbsa4b07svae1.png?width=423&format=png&auto=webp&s=8306bb2b74c7fed3bb5e36cf02fcfbd3b0d1fda4

Select the backrest of the horizontal one and **move it down a few pixels.** Fits almost perfectly

https://preview.redd.it/xia03zo7svae1.png?width=343&format=png&auto=webp&s=3382fafd92b1e7ceb2f5efb33d1fc60b5145905c

**Combine both layers** and paint in the connecting areas. You'll eventually get a hang of the needed shading, where to use darker colors etc.

**That's the basic gist of creating your own furniture.** It's a creative task and your furniture will be very different from mine so **get creative**. It's just some pixels to place.

[You don't have to place everything correctly right away.](https://preview.redd.it/ni24yeddsvae1.png?width=1221&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f3378de4d68d1dbbc9eb607f377a9fb05a40fcc)

# Step 5 - Let's build a wall

I decided to use this **blue wall** as base. I also want to create as many ""closed"" rooms as possible while still maintining most of the floor area, so I place the wall **roughly half-way from where it would sit IRL**. (I told you your baseplan doesn't have to be down to the milimeter)

https://preview.redd.it/hbefjxmisvae1.png?width=1221&format=png&auto=webp&s=5010a831e11f31ad63239e8b7ff6d2063fb78089

Move the **front part down** to where you need it and **extend it to the top**. Thats basicly it! You just do that several times. **Move your pieces, connect and so on**. Again start **from** the **outside and move to the inside**.

https://preview.redd.it/76xkc2jlsvae1.png?width=213&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4bf8be79b954147c072762cbd2e7be661c40381

https://preview.redd.it/wm9oua5psvae1.png?width=194&format=png&auto=webp&s=3073ca3be6553dd6425eb727fdbbf6993459cea8

You can make walls thinner or thicker as needed, just keep the 2x2 px rule in mind!

https://preview.redd.it/8uquevtqsvae1.png?width=1221&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f7044f8dbe5df531788ab2864c18b23e5d10645

As you can see I **completly ignored half of my walls** and the diagonal section on the left. I just didn't want to create diagonal pixelart walls and definitly no rotated furniture! but it doesn't matter, the **general sense of space** is there and that's all you need.

# Step 5 - Details! Details! Details!

https://preview.redd.it/wqmhhsftsvae1.png?width=1221&format=png&auto=webp&s=e204e8f0e379578254f24b84e0764e32a54b0297

We placed all our furniture and walls, but it looks a bit boring. **Time to add the fun** stuff that let's you jump into even more rabbit holes and waste 50% of your time!

https://preview.redd.it/7mkwld02tvae1.png?width=526&format=png&auto=webp&s=f405074fbaafb9b08fd6d395d3e5af61346fc5fb

**Placing carpet, doors, flowers, plants, coffee mugs and lamps makes the place look cozy and livable!**

**Crop your picture** to the outer edge of your walls and we are done!  
Save it as **.png** under an **easy to remember name** (in my case pokemon.png)

# Step 6 - Time for HomeAssistant

We will need the **""file-editor"" add-on** to upload our .png to HomeAssistant.  
After installation, click ""browse filesystem"" (top left) and look for the ""**www**"" folder.  
If it's not there yet, **create it**.

**/homeassistant/www** \- here we will upload our file(s).

Open your dashboard and create a new view to make sure you don't mess up your existing configs.  
\- Add a ""picture elements card""  
\- **Delete** the standard state badge and **open the Card Options**.  
\- Our **Image path** will always start with **/local/** followed by our picture name **including** filetype.  
\-- In my case: **/local/pokemon.png**

https://preview.redd.it/tskzjnoluvae1.png?width=1002&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae2e89d6fbc73ff7f3fd615d75124a914bbbb995

You could let it sit like this and just add your lightswitches on top, but that would be boring!

**We will create some actual glowing lights.**

# Step 7 - Make it shine!

https://preview.redd.it/uy1gyckntvae1.png?width=891&format=png&auto=webp&s=0314393a6684ae824ffeccb73120a24de00b78f1

After some design magic I created a night scene using a **dark blue top layer**.

Save your complete plan **WITHOUT LIGHTS ON** as a new file (**ex.** **pokemon\_night.png**)  
Add some white/yellow/orange glows.

https://preview.redd.it/l097uuknuvae1.png?width=891&format=png&auto=webp&s=29e3e988ba1b5a87c5b291bbdb20af039956fc02

Always keeping in mind that I need **clear seperation** **between** my different glows.  
This makes it easier in the next step.

https://preview.redd.it/nb43k4jpuvae1.png?width=891&format=png&auto=webp&s=b80e6ad6f2ec8d4891faaeae79c67ddd01d644df

\- **Select** the room, **invert your selection** and just **delete** everything around it.

\- **Save** that as another **new .png** with a descriptive name (**ex. pokemon\_night\_table.png**)

Repeat that step for all lights/rooms.  
**Upload all your files into ""www""**

Edit your picture elements card and add a **new conditional element**.  
Give it a nice title and add a condition.  
I just used the sun sensor and told it **""State is equal to"" - ""Below horizon""**

Once the sun set you will now see everything we do. **For ease of config** you can do **that step last** unless it's already sunset when you do this, **else you won't see what you're doing**.

Add a **new Image element inside your conditional**, this will be our new nighttime backdrop.  
Under ""Select Image Path"" choose ""local path or web URL"" add **/local/pokemon\_night.png**

It will look a bit silly since it's **too small**, scroll down to ""Sytle"" and **paste this**:

    transform: none
    left: 0%
    top: 0%

Now it should fit! **Save your progress!**

Add **another Image element**. Select the light **entitiy** you want **to control** and select ""Nothing"" under ""Tap behavior"" and ""Hold behavior""  
Put in your Local image path and the Style code from above.  
It should fit right in but it's black and white?

Paste this into ""State filter""

    ""on"": opacity(100%)
    ""off"": opacity(0%)

This will make your picture transparent when off instead of greyscale. **Save your Progress!**

**Repeat for all your rooms/lights.**

# Step 8 - Should've clicked by now

**The next step must be done at the very end!**  
**Otherwise the buttons we will add won't be clickable.**

\- Add a completely **new element, outside your Conditional.**  
\- Add ""State icon"" select your entity, choose your icon and give it a decriptive title.  
\- Choose ""Tap behavior"" Toggle

You can **move the Icon** on your plan by changing the **""Style"" left/top**.

To give it a **fixed color** add: `""--paper-item-icon-color"": white`

To change the **opacity** add: `opacity: 80%`

Again... **repeat for all your entitities** you want to add **AND SAVE YOUR PROGRESS!**

# Step 9 - Success?

If you followed this guide (and I didnt make any huge mistakes) everything should be clickable now and your rooms should nicely fade in and out.

Hi all,

I've always enjoyed a good coffee, grew up with Moccamaster drip machines and later got to try a good coffee made by Italian person with the Bialetti mokapot. Bought mokapot for myself but never managed to get good coffee with it so it's been sitting on the shelf unused. Been satisfied with the Nespresso pod machine for past few years until I was forced to learn the Breville Barista Express at work and now I've been researching a good beginner friendly coffee machine that can grow with me if/when I get sucked into the hobby. Shortlisted a few options like the Breville Dual Boiler that seems to hit the marks but how is the reliability and after warranty repairs? Seems like less beginner friendly features but maybe longer life options would be the Gaggia Classic and Rancilio Silvia V6. They both seem to require aftermarket PID upgrade etc. 
There are lot of second hand Breville on the market, are they a risk? I'd hate to blow half of my budget for out of warranty machine that breaks down within a year.

I would be buying beans ground from a local cafe until I get the rest of the coffee making skills down.

I'm so confused at this point. Looking for experienced opinions on these three options and if there is another to consider?",3,1735955774.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

What would be the best way to move forward?,"My boyfriend and I began dating last January. It was going really well but in the back of my mind initially I didn’t feel ready for the relationship and I also felt like he felt the same due to things he would say. We met at work and I think that initially made us quite codependent and unhealthy. This is because I had to temporarily move to his city as part of my job and he was essentially the only person I would spend time with in this new city in and outside of work. He told me he loved me but hadn’t been in a relationship before ours for 6 years. He is very attractive and tall but due to mental health he took a break from sex for a couple of years then was addicted to dating apps just before he met me and a year or two before this - he claimed it was for validation which I believe. 

Anyway a couple of months in cracks began to form. We started to argue and he would get irrationally mad at me and I was very close to breaking up with him for this reason a couple of times. I also felt he was hiding something from me but my love for him and our unhealthy codependency made me ignore this gut feeling.

It turned out he was chatting to girls (in other countries) on online sex chat rooms and showing them his penis. I broke up with him. He convinced me to take him back almost instantly and I did. 

I think before this I was such a point of security for him. Seeing he could lose me basically made him lose his trust in me. He also has always had the conviction that he is a good person so to rationalise his actions and protect himself he broke up with me a week later and said I was too sweet/ not jaded enough for him. He also had a best friend at the time who always rationalised his actions that had told him that there must me something wrong with me and that’s why he cheated and that it wasn’t that bad because he didn’t cheat physically.

Anyway I was heartbroken. I gave him many chances by this point and he broke up with me. The next day he texted me saying he to talk to me. I had to get my stuff anyway so I agreed. He kept apologising to me but I found out he was on dating apps the very same day he broke up with me and told him to fuck off forever. He spam called me and my other work friends who I was drinking with trying to explain himself, trying to apologise. He was texting me apologies all night. 

Some of his messages seemed very desperate and I was worried he would do something to himself so I went to see him before work. He had been crying all night I could see it in his eyes. He kept apologising and he kept saying that he couldn’t believe he didn’t realise I was the most important thing in his life. I went to work and he didn’t. Instead he went to buy presents all day and kept showing up with things during my breaks. 

I felt bad and stayed with him for a couple of days. I didn’t agree to be his girlfriend again. He went to his family home about 4 hours away (I know he was actually there since I still had his phone location) after since his mental health was really bad at this point trying to take in everything he had done.

I was being sweet to him at this point and I said he could ask me out again when he was back.

During this time he went cold again and I was completely heartbroken since he said he wasn’t sure what he wanted again. 

For the first time in my life I downloaded dating apps after this. I met three guys within this week but couldn’t even bring myself to kiss any of them.

I saw my boyfriend when he came back AGAIN since I still had stuff there. We argued for hours. I hinted at moving on and again something switched in him. He didn’t want to date for a while after me so the fact I did made him worried. He proposed that neither of us dated for six months then see how we feel.  said this was ridiculous given how things had ended. He said he didn’t want to date anyway. I didn’t tell him I had gone on a couple of dates especially since nothing came from them.

Later that day he called me when he was struggling with his mental health. I helped him.

It was that simple moment that led him to realise he needed me he says. From this point he was obsessed with getting me back. He would buy me coffees every morning, call me all the time etc. During this time I was contemplating what I wanted with him and he knew this.

One day I went out with friends and a mutual friend was there who I had known for a few months now. We ended up drunk kissing and he immediately asked me on a date. 

I told my boyfriend that we kissed and were kind of talking. He was heartbroken but he understood he had hurt me a lot more and since we weren’t together that I wasn’t his. He asked me if anything more had happened and I said no. I asked if he would want to know and he said no.

The issue is that he shares a flat with my coworker. We went on a date and afterwards we slept together. We went on another and my coworker found out. This coworker is a bit crazy (gets drunk, says controversial things) so I was worried. I really didn’t want my boyfriend to know because I didn’t want to hurt him. A few of my coworkers who are closer to me found out too. I dated the guy for about three weeks before I realised I still loved my boyfriend and was willing to forgive him.

I dated my boyfriend exclusively for a couple of after this and then agreed to be his girlfriend again.

Basically our relationship is amazing now because so much came out during our break up that we were able to start fresh but I hate the fact that I slept with that guy and I hate the fact that I keep this from my boyfriend but I’m scared that I would lose him forever now that our relationship is amazing if he found out. 

TL;DR: My boyfriend broke up with me after he cheated on me online then realised he wanted me. I didn’t know what I wanted and wasn’t ready to forgive him and ended up sleeping with another guy while we were broken up. Now that we are back together I feel awful not telling him. What’s the best way to move forward? Should I keep it from him or risk losing him and tell him?",0,1735955132.0,relationship_advice,2,0.25,False

We have been friends for 4 years now and yes, at some point we both were attracted to each other and we knew it but we never actually did anything about it. Around the age of 15-16, I decided to put a move on him when he came over. We watched a movie together and i laid on his chest while caressing it. He accepted it but didn’t really do anything to reciprocate.
After the movie i decided to be more bold and grind on him (i was 15 give me a break) and yet again there was no reciprocation.

I was embarrassed and decided that i should just wash away these feelings and move on after the obvious rejection. So i ghosted him for a year. But it wasn’t as if he tried reaching out either. I moved on and started dating this amazing guy.

After the year of ghosting i accidentally met him after my training and we caught up over coffee where he invited me to his 17th bday party.

We got drunk and as he was walking me to the uber, there was a point in time where it looked like he really wanted to kiss me and that he was holding back. I found that peculiar but wrote it off to the intoxication. That was 8 months ago and since then we started talking more often, rekindling the friendship and catching up on major life events.

About a week ago, however, he got drunk and confessed that he never forgot about me and that he loved me this entire time, even when i ghosted him. I confronted him about the rejection and turns out he didn’t reject me he was just completely oblivious to my attempts. He swore on his late mothers grave that his love for me is serious but he also said that he doesn’t expect me to return his feelings and he himself would slap me if i try breaking up with my current bf. He said he would rather see me happy and that he’s willing to just stand by on the side if that makes me happy.

The thing now is that i am feeling a whole lot of feelings rn. I care a lot about my friend but i don’t know if it’s love. There is definitely attraction but attraction isn’t really love yk. I love my current bf but i can’t stop thinking about my friend. It’s like im yearning for him and craving for his touch and soul and it physically makes me sick the less i talk to my friend now. I have an itch to see him and talk to him all the time now. I cry when he’s away and talking to him is the highlight of my day.

He has preteen kids from a previous marriage. I like Karl & I've always thought he was a good guy who Susan loves & is happy with. Im not close with him but we get on well. She's always found it very hard to trust due to past trauma. She confides in me and told me that a few months ago Karl had confessed to her that he was in a lot of debt with credit cards etc. She was angry at first at his secrecy but she sorted it out, took away his credit cards & consolidated the debt etc. She told me she just can't trust him with money.
I am financially quite secure after the sudden death of my amazing husband aged 53 and I've had a few scammers take advantage when I was more vulnerable. 
Out of the blue Karl msged me to ask for money. He wrote a long spiel that he felt awful that he couldn't even take Susan out for a coffee as he has no money. That she does so much for their family. Also that if I bought out some of his debt then he wouldn't have to pay me the interest so could pay it of quicker! I was really shocked as I dont have private chats with him & I feel he's betraying susans trust by asking me. He said he was sorry if it put me in a awkward position! He really has. I said no because I'm not a bank! Im disabled after a life changing accident & my money is part of my future security.
But my dillema is whether to tell Susan he asked me? 
I'd find it extremely difficult to be listening to her talking about Karl's financial problems and not say anything. It would be lying by ommission to me. But if I say something I'm worried I'll derail their marriage. A couple of people I've talked too have said to keep my mouth shut as their marriage isn't my business. But if she finds out through him then she'll never trust me again. I just dont know what the right thing to do is?

I (17F) and my boyfriend (18M) have been together for almost 2 years. Me and my 4 friends planned this big camping trip in June, and of course my bf came along.

He brought a bottle of vodka, a bottle of Malibu, and some beers, as far as I can remember. Me and my friends don't drink much/at all, so it ended up being mostly for him. I had one beer the whole time, and plenty of water. 

He grabbed a pack of cards one of the nights and came up with some drinking game, which involved some kind of jungle juice shot. We had already been playing card games, and everyone wanted to play a game, but nobody really wanted to drink. (He was steadily drinking the whole night, making mixed drinks with juice.) Everyone started to fizzle out, and one of the friends with shaky mental health was also drinking, at my bf's encouragement, and we were getting concerned about her as well. We packed it up and went to bed in our respective tents, with me and my bf in one. 

We had the one air mattress, and it was close quarters, like, yk, a tent. We started trying to go to bed, but he started asking for sex. I tried to politely decline, as he was drunk as hell and I just didn't want it. He then started breaking down and crying and complaining that he ""wishes he wasn't like this"" and that he's ""too horny"" and all this stuff. We've had this conversation before, and he's convinced me to ""try"" sex when I wasn't in the mood on many occasions. At one point into the crying and rambling, he suddenly kind of lunged at me across the bed and grabbed me, and started kissing my neck. I pushed him off, and he went silent. After a moment I quietly said ""I didn't like that."" He then resumed the crying and rambling about how he's a terrible person, I'm sure you get the gist. I tried to get us to just go to bed, and we laid down. 

At one point he got up and left the tent, didn't say anything, and I figured he was going to the bathroom. About 5-10 minutes pass, and I got up and poked my head out of the tent to check where he was. And he was just standing on the little through-road of the campsite, under a streetlight, maybe 20 feet from the bathrooms. I watched for a sec, and he didn't move. I sighed and got my shoes on and went to where he was standing. He stayed motionless until I got there, and I basically said ""what the hell, let's go to bed"", and we did. He fell asleep soon after, and I laid there, pretty terrified to be sleeping right next to him. But I did, and in the morning, for some reason, we did have sex. Not against my will, but I couldn't give you a good reason. 

After that, that day, we didn't really talk. I was already shaken up by all that, and then my bf was just, like, sulking in the backseat of my car. And, I had to put on a face in front of my friends, and get over it as quick as possible. I didn't tell them then, I think I told one of them well after the trip. 

Me and my bf both just kind of, ignored it and moved on, for the sake of enjoying the camping trip, I guess. And for all intents and purposes it was a great trip, we had a huge spot, on the river, we brought everything we could possibly need, and it was a lot of fun. It was basically our graduation trip, a week or 2 after. But now, of course, I do have that bit to stain the memory.


Small other incident, I brought him back to my homestate for Thanksgiving recently. We stayed at my grandparents big beautiful house, which has a full bar room for my grandpa. This is the first time I've brought a partner home, and I expected him to behave.

Unfortunately, he didn't, as I'm sure you could guess. My family had mimosas on Thanksgiving morning, and my bf joined in, probably 9-10am. He was basically just drinking glasses of champagne, while my family had balanced mimosas and I had coffee. He did not stop drinking for the rest of the day. By the end of the night he literally just had a red solo cup with straight vodka in it. He got in the hot tub in the backyard with the rest of my family, drinking the cup of vodka. He got very dehydrated in the hot tub and the cold desert air, and spent the rest of the night vomiting in the bathroom. Thank God there was more than one bathroom. 

My family sequestered him to the laundry room with an air mattress, and gave him water bottles and a trash can, and they jokingly put post-it notes all over the bar that said ""NO (BF'S NAME)"" ""NOT FOR YOU!"" and other such things. They took it well, and didn't blame me for what he did, but I was still EXTREMELY embarrassed. I take you home to meet my family for Thanksgiving and this is how you act?? 
Any time I ever bring up Thanksgiving he gets upset at me for ""making him feel bad"", even if I make a joke out of it. 
Would I be overreacting to leave over these incidents? 


Edit: This actually happened to me June of 2021. I am now 20NB/M, single, and happy about it. 
I honestly just wanted to write it out, and get some minor internet validation that this was like, not cool, and not just normal high school relationship shit. Sometimes your younger self needs retroactive validation, idk.

He broke up with me, if you can believe it. It kind of played off as a mutual thing, that we were just ""going different ways"" or something. I had come out to him as asexual, probably a few months before the break, and he was allegedly okay with it. Then a friend told me she'd talked to him, and he'd cited the asexuality as a reason for leaving. 

It also turned out I was not asexual, just mildly traumatized by this idiot. He was constantly coercing me into sex, until my body basically shut down. I had no sex drive and no interest until literally like, a few weeks after we broke up.

He also still came with me to a party of a family friend after we broke up, where he again got drunk, as well as high (weed and mushrooms) and was crying and asking me to drive him to his new girlfriend's apartment. I did not, and I drove him home.

(I also came out to him as nonbinary shortly after, and his response was essentially ""okay, cool, whatever, just don't be a guy."" Now here I am, 2½ years on testosterone lmao.)

Just last year I feel like I tried everything I possibly could. I reached out to and got back in contact with irl friends- fun while it lasted but I’ve come to realise I’m the one that always has to reach out. Became a lot more open at work and chatty with coworkers- nice but hasn’t really led anywhere outside of work (also they fired my fave coworker…). Took a couple hobby classes and again, it was nice but I didn’t find much potential to build real relationships. Met someone here on Reddit and okay yeah, that one worked out and now I have a good friend so I can’t be completely upset. Joined Discord servers, one that I settled into really nicely but again- it’s hard to build those real connections with people? Especially people who clearly already have their own lives and friend groups etc… I was at such desperate measures just for casual conversation that I spent about a week using a knockoff Omegle site (don’t recommend, very few people are there to chat lmao). Generally got back to being active online after staying off social media for my early 20s (can’t recommend that shit enough) and it’s nice, chatting with people in passing feels like the equivalent of sparking up a conversation at a bus stop. 

A bit over halfway through the year my partner and I moved out of my moms place into our own, not too far from my family but further than I’ve been used to, and with my partner heading into work and me WFH, I’ve been reaaallllyyyyy noticing that it’s sending me insane to be home alone 75% of the time. I’m immensely grateful for those I do have in my life, really, but unfortunately it’s just not quite enough to heal the aching loneliness I feel. 

I started counselling a while ago to help me deal with anxiety/feeling like a failure/like I’m not good enough and it’s been so, so helpful. I can feel my mentality shifting in a more positive way. It feels just a tiiiny bit easier to talk myself down from negative thoughts now. It’s progress and I’ll keep up with my sessions for a while longer. 

Anyway, I remembered a situation the other day that reminded me that no one really checked up on me after a really difficult and painful situation a few months ago… People I practically begged to come visit soon that never got back to me, people I’ve known for almost a decade and cherish really dearly… It hurt and I kinda spiralled for the last few days. Cried a lot. Yesterday was real bad. I tried to invite my sister over, offered her train fare and such and she was… very reluctant. Not because she had plans or anything but I guess because I wasn’t quite worth the inconvenience because she decided to come over half hour later when my nephew offered her taxi fare instead… I don’t think I’ve ever had salt rubbed so deep into a wound before then lmao. I practically cried on the phone to our mom at the end of the day. 

Aaanyywayyy, I’ve had enough sulking… I see where I stand more clearly now. I have my mom and my partner who are here, in person and there for me through anything. I have maybe two online friends who I can truly turn to and confide in… and I have my couple of irl friends who I guess I can only expect casual hangouts from after all. I tried a lot of methods to find people last year, but I’m still not done. A few last tricks up my sleeve… 

I’m going to apply for a type of volunteering where you spend a few hours per month with a child in care, just taking them out to do an activity of their choice. It’s a two year minimum commitment so I’ve been sitting on it for a few months but I’m set now. Partner and I don’t want kids of our own and fostering is something I was always open to… but especially lately I find myself really wishing I had someone to care for. It feels like a nice meet-in-the-middle of giving myself the chance to look after someone who needs it even if I can’t open my home to them. I only work 4 days per week so I’m probably going to take up some other kind of local volunteering too. I’ve been considering the community cafe/food bank but need to go down there and chat with them about it. 

Before I moved here last summer I had looked into some workout groups/classes and there’s a good few but I haven’t gotten around to joining any yet. Finances are a little more comfortable now so I’m going to find one and sign up. Speaking of, I feel like I wish there were more online groups who actually get together on video call and do a shared hobby. I know they DO exist but man, I can’t seem to find specifically what I’d like. In my teens I used to run an art server where we’d get together and draw or do guided figure drawing practice. I wanna do something like that again. I also think it would be fun (if not a little chaotic/difficult to pull off) to cook together with others on video call… I love cooking with people I just hate people actually being in my kitchen lmao. But WHATEVER yknow? I want those things so I’m gonna try and set them up, why the hell not. It’s worth the effort, I’ll make sure of it. 

I think I did try quite hard to seek out human connection last year… if nothing else, I’m probably a lot less socially awkward than I used to be so I’ll consider that a win. But this time… I’m ready to be a lot more aggressive, or assertive. Whichever makes most sense in this context. I see a lot of people in passing and consider striking up conversations and never do even though there’s really no harm in at least trying. I’ll try harder. Irl I have a very nice, bubbly though maybe too sickeningly sweet demeanour I just let myself get overshadowed by anxiety. I’ll start just inviting people out for coffee. ‘Oh you’re into that thing I’m also into? Why don’t we get together and xyz?’ that kind of initiative. I saw someone reading manga on the train a few months back, specifically a manga I’ve always wondered if I should pick up and I SHOULD HAVE asked him about it when we got off at the same stop but I was being a little baby about it. I’m tired of talking myself down from low risk social interaction!! No more of that anymore. I’ve had enough sulking and whining and feeling lonely. Consider me a force to be reckoned with this year. Maybe I still won’t make the most emotionally invested friendships, but maybe I can at least meet a lot of strangers and find a way to make them smile, to chat and laugh and joke with them. I think that would be enough to keep me going. 

If you actually read all of this, thank you!! My brain has been whirring for days and no amount of ranting about it seems to empty my thoughts… so I’ll turn to action instead. Wish me luck!",2,1735954148.0,self,0,1.0,False

I had asked him about his band and ended up being a little flirty towards the end. 2 weeks passed with no reply and I chalked it up to him either not being interested/ or because he didn’t know me. He randomly asked me out for coffee which then turned into a 3 week talking period where we got to know each other, talked about dates we were going to go on, flirted, he gave me his number, etc. We had plans for me to attend one of his bands shows later in the week and I was so excited. 

Randomly he sent me this message: “I feel really embarrassed by this but I had some realizations this weekend about where I am mentally when it comes to getting to know you in this flirty  and expectant way. This is definitely stemming from the fact that I got out of a relationship not all that long ago. It’s been a few months and when I messaged you I thought I was done and moved on from it, but I was just hit with a ton of emotional bricks this weekend while I was driving to and from DC. That’s really why you haven’t heard from me too much the last few days. I truly was occupied all day and late into Saturday night, but I was also trying to process things amidst it all. Maybe this is way too long winded than usual necessary with how little we know each other, but I didn’t want you to think there was anything personal about these feelings. I’m actually really bummed because you’ve been so fun to talk with, you ask good questions, appear to be  genuinely interested in things that I do, and seems like we would have a lot of common interests. I just don’t think I’m feeling comfortable continuing getting to know you in this way while I’m having these feelings because I don’t want to ignore them and just end up leading you on too long and playing with your emotions (or worse… steal your secret thrifting spots). I think we’ve all been in that situation and nobody deserves that. So to put it plainly I think there’s some stability I need to find within myself before I start trying to put myself back out there. I’m really sorry :/“

It seemed very sincere and genuine. I told him in my own message all was good and I understand that he needed time. He told me to still come to the show. We met at the show, had a few nice friendly conversations, and I left. Over the past 1.5 months or so, we’ve texted a couple times but the last two texts I sent were left on read so I haven’t said anything else. On New Year’s Eve I attended one his bands shows with some friends and he ended up waving at me and we ended up talking for over an hour. His friends left to go to another party and he stayed back. My friends left and then he and I talked awhile longer and then he gave me a ride home. I asked if he wanted to come in and meet my cat but he said he was really tired which was legitimate and it was very late anyway so I understood. Since then he has not texted me, it’s been about 4 days. 

My dilemma is that I really like him and am super attracted to him. He seems to like me at least platonically and obviously found me attractive at one point since we were in a talking stage. On nye he was smiling and laughing a lot and we got along great. I want to respect his boundaries and not continue to persue him or initiate texting but I’m also becoming very impatient and would like to know if there’s any chance for the future if I stay in his orbit or if I should just give up and move on. What do you think is the best route here? I’m still keeping my options open but I tend to hyperfixate on one person at a time and I’ve never been in a situation like this where it’s kind of a gray area. Guys either reject me straight up or they like me and we see where it goes. Not sure how to handle this. ",1,1735954106.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

That is until I hear a high pierced screaming of “AYUDA AYUDA AYUDA” (help help help). With no orcs in sight at all, as they seemed away and clustered at the Black Gate, I entered the Fiery Mountain’s archway where I heard the screaming which lead to a center platform.
All below the platform were vast amounts of smoldering hot lava awaiting to erupt! 

I see these 2 small halflings fighting and grappling this other strange small humanoid figure who was on all four’s and referred to himself as “Smeagol”. One of the halflings gets knocked out as I quickly rushed into the fray! “Smeagol” then bites off the finger of the other halfling still conscious, and starts to celebrate while holding this Golden Ring aloft from the bitten off finger in joy. All while the still conscious halfling is bleeding out in agony from his missing finger! I do what any good samaritan would do, and push this “Smeagol” off the platform while he holds the Gold Ring, into the burning lava pit below in retaliation. 

Wild morning, and while I was worried about getting my GMT dirty from the dirt, ashes, and lava flying around, my worry was subsided after being thoroughly thanked by the still conscious halfling who said their name was “Frodo”.

When we first started talking she explained she didn’t want commitment or for either of us to get attached during this process. Pretty much just friends with benefits. That changed the first time we had sex. Went straight into deep conversations, cuddling, which then turned into dates, staying the night, meeting friends/family and even each other’s kids within the first month. She explained she was an avoidant attachment person who came out an 11 year marriage where the last 5 years she’s been getting cheated on. I quickly found out I was an anxious attachment specifically with her (never been an anxious attachment to any other woman). Everything was good the first month, the within one week I lost my grandfather, my job, and was going through a lot of stress. I picked little fights that were easily resolved, and talked to an ex who reached out in condolences of my grandpa. When I told her she was sad I had talked to an ex, held out for about a week, then told me she needed “space”, that I was “too much”, and that she couldn’t “handle”me. November was back and forth between a couple days good, then she’d shut me out, and did this cycle on repeat. Finally at the beginning of December I ignored her and told her she can live her life without me because I need a partner to who wants to fight for me, not with me. She cried, changed from “We need to go a while not talking to each other cold turkey” to 2 days later saying “I never wanted a life completely without you” because I refused to be her friend. Since then, we’ve been GREAT! Celebrate all the holidays, went on dates, made perfect strides, and understood each other very well. I finally met her baby daddy January 1st and it went well with him. Yesterday morning I take her coffee in the morning, she gives me a kiss, and we chat on the phone. She brings up she’d like to do couples therapy with a guy we had both seen in the past, but in the future. I do my therapy session, and when I finish she during that time removed locations. When I asked her if we were good she absolutely switched tunes she was doing previously before. Suddenly she said I move too fast cus I say in 1-2 years we could move in together, in 3-4 could get married, and that I wouldn’t be married to someone who wouldn’t take my last name (like ex-wife) ever again. Then starts saying she shouldn’t have to compromise for anything and neither should I, she shouldn’t have to wait for me to get through school cus why wouldn’t she want a partner of “equal yoke”, and says because I made it apparent that I won’t be friends we just shouldn’t talk anymore. We’ve both been highly involved each others lives, kids lives, and social lives. I’m just taken away on how everything switched in 2 hours and a conversation with her friend.

We named the community Around The Corner (www.aroundthecorner.today) with our belief that we are all already surrounded by good people within our arm's reach.

**🌱 How ATC started**

During the entire 8 years in the Bay Area, I had repeated the same day in and out for so long. Living a socially isolated life soon brought depression that I didn't know very well about how to deal with. One random night when I couldn't really get into sleep again, I wrote about my long-time life problem on social media. It had gone viral to reach 17K people throughout the night, and next day, I got connected with hundreds of Bay Area people saying they felt the same way.  

If that many people felt the same way, shouldn't we talk to each other? I came to Reddit to widen my horizon beyond the tech bubble and occasionally posted my thoughts and idea of asking people to join my coffee break in South Bay. In three months, I met 26 people in person, and unexpectedly got a long growing waitlist of over 150 people.

With a great amount of support from r/bayarea and r/sanfrancisco, I thought maybe we could make something we wish to have. The funny strong commonality we all shared was -- we were never opinionated enough for Twitter, never outgoing enough for Meetup, never crazy enough for Tiktok, and so tired of mindless scrolling and swiping left-right.

**☕️ Water the community grow**

Late 2023, one of my coffee strangers joined me to grow the project together. We both were from tech, so it wasn't too difficult to put things together. By that time, the project has grown organically to reach to Southern California. We launched our first website January 2024 and I started jumping between NorCal and SoCal.

**⏰ 2024 Retrospective**

We got some interesting numbers to read. As of today, ATC just welcomed our 1979th new member and ATC members found 690 coffee matches. Starting from last summer, we've done 15 rounds of social gatherings in NorCal and SoCal. To celebrate our 1 year milestone, I'm returning back to the Bay Area in a few weeks to throw our new year's social gatherings. 

If you read this far, thank you. If you recognized who I am, thanks a lot. If we've had a chance to chat or meet in some way, thank you so much for your support. We hope to keep our community to be a place where we find real connections and bring social back to real life.

\--

If you are interested in our new year's social gatherings,

Of course, you are welcome to join. I've made some reservations for our socials between mid Jan and Feb at three locations in Mountain View, Campbell, and Oakland. If you want to know more, come to [our website](http://www.aroundthecorner.today/?ref=rcc) and scroll through. Each event has its own card on the feed.

1ht2ksj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychosis/comments/1ht2ksj/did_i_break_my_brain_with_stress/,Did I break my brain with stress?,"Some thoughts. 

Some time ago I noticed some specks of light in my vision, googled it(knew i shouldntve, and was told I didnt need a doctor), and got freaked out that I was right about to loose my vision. These specks were in my vision all the time. It fueled my stress. I also had a huge amount of stress cause I got scared I was going deaf. (neither happened, I just have alot of health anxiety). Passed out the first time and it stayed at the forefront of my mind for at least half of the duration of my classes if not longer. (I remember it being there during the midterms and then died out).

I also had alot of stress and over time I think everything compounded. Stress from my major but also stress from thinking that every time i saw a little speck of light I was going to wake up blind or become blind at any moment. (I later realized that these little flashes of light were the same color as items near them and would intensify during exams. This helped me calm myself some. They subsided over time).

I think I couldve just had so much stress and anxiety that it messed uo my brain. Honestly the flashes stopped completely which is good.(but that anxiety over blindness gets revived). Classes ended, in hindsight weird thngs just popped of around and hey I think I had some depression during part of it cause I ""realized I wasn't meant to have survived being born"".

Also suspected i had OCD or something due to reasons I didnt actually get checked out for.  I also... visualized this? thought of that? as some sort of copy of myself trying to get into my mind and try to harm me?

then after those classes ended I quit coffee cause I ""realized it was being used to keep me in some sort of simulation/experiment, then maybe out of it/flip flopped. Kept a vibe of ""theres another soul, in some shape or form, attatched to me"", but my rationalization of that changed a couple times.

I'd quit coffee, seemingly sometimes would be hyper sometimes it made me feel sad, ect. Started it back up. Lots of other weird things over that time. Had some paranoia i can pinpoint and partially suspected I had something wrong going on.

After that... idk what happened but it was fine and then for some time and then I just overly fixated on spirituality(ik i do have adhd and sometimes overly focus on that, which wasnt good, but it wasnt healthy and got back into the whole ""second spirit/soul connected"" thing, and thought it let me have a spiritual connection. When it stopped it felt like my brain folded back into itself a bit into how it was supposed to be. I mean I was aware I wasnt supposed to be thinking some things.

I think its more or less back to normal? the whole ""having intrusive thoughts occasionally, simmilar levels of health anxiety regarding the same things"" is back. Not really into the weird ideas. Started dreaming again. sometimes I go through long periods of not dreaming.

(also had a bunch of parnoia stuff that I think has been going away right now but never actually left back then. Just made myself accept it which stopped the anxiety, but I still thought it was happening... never really did come close to doing anything regretful except wanting to leave home asap due to it.)

I 100% need to talk to someone about my health anxiety... its really really bad.

(what tipped me off to something being wrong honestly was experiencing a quick event and then realizing theres no way it couldve happened. Saw someone directly behind me making a gesture to the street, several times where i did an action only to realize the next day I didnt. And really really recently I asked my mom about an eye doctor I got a familly calander reminder from, only for her to be confused and for that email not to exist).

Overstimulation is a hyperaroused ""wired"" state of mind that might be described as like drinking too much coffee.

Generalised anxiety disorder can involve the symptom of edgy mental tension, but this edgy tense state is not quite the same as overstimulation, even though it may feel similar.

Does anyone here have both symptoms? How do you distinguish between them, given they are quite similar?

In the new year I really wanted to become serious with losing weight and getting down to the 120s or 130s. I am keeping a pretty close count on my calories And my goal was to eat less than 1600 calories on an inactive day, and less than 1800 calories on an active day which I think is reasonable. 

The last few days I've been eating around 1300 calories with meals that I feel are fulfilling. But I look at a lot of comments online about how that's not enough and that's an unsafe caloric intake to have throughout the day. 

But even today I'm at about 1,300 calories and I feel like I've had pretty good meals. I was just wondering what everyone else's experience was. 

So today is an example about 1300 cal

Breakfast:
-10oz coffee with milk and sugar
-Bannana
Roughly 250cal

Lunch:
-Apple
-Greek yogurt 
-half cup of wheat cereal 
-water bottle 20oz
-sparkling water 12oz
Roughly 275 cal

Dinner:
-cola (soda stream) 
-Salmon 4oz
-Carrots 5oz
-couscous 1 serving size per DV
All with lemon juice and garlic salt
Roughly 520 cal

Desert
-2% milk 12oz
-2 chocolates
Roughly 275 cal

I'm not skipping any meals, but I am being careful about what I eat. I have a few servings of fruits, vegetables, and at least 50oz of water t/o the day. ",1,1735952274.0,WeightLossAdvice,7,0.67,False

You can still damage your teeth by, eg, biting something too hard, or getting punched, or whatever, and can go to a dentist for that, but you also can't get routine dental cleanings.

You may use toothpicks, rinse your mouth with water, chew gum, pick your teeth with a fingernail, eat or drink things that smell nice, or use floss only and specifically to remove things that you can feel stuck between two teeth that you can't dislodge with your nails or a toothpick, but aside from that you can never use a toothbrush, floss, mouthwash, water pik, or any other normal dental hygiene device or substance.  And no, someone else can't use them on you, except and explicitly during dental visits to repair actual damage.

If you forget or change your mind and use a forbidden device or substance, you will suddenly acquire all of the dental damage that you would have gotten from your neglect since you took the deal.

And, yes, your breath can still stink, you can have visible plaque or food, your teeth can be stained by things like coffee, you are only protected from damage, not unpleasantness.

I love making drinks. Some days I even love the “coffeehouse hospitality” aspect of the job the CEO seems to want us to go back to. 

But I’m so burnt out here. I cannot bring myself to give a flying fart about drive times. All I care about is building a culture of inclusivity and friendliness between the partners so we’re not miserable while we’re here. But all they want us to focus on are numbers, numbers, numbers. And I just can’t care when we are constantly struggling on 3-partner plays because we apparently haven’t earned the labor for those day parts yet. I’m tired of drowning when I desperately need just one more body on the floor so I can do SSV tasks, make backups, or even just wash the damn dishes so we can get backups done at all.

Not really sure what to expect or even looking forward to this “Getting Back to Starbucks” meeting we’re all gonna have this month. I just feel like I don’t belong here. I wish I could work in an actual coffeehouse but nowhere else is going to pay me as well as this job and that’s another thing that makes me feel so bitter about this place. Yes the pay is the best I’ve ever had. Yeah the benefits are decent too, for the first time in my life I have healthcare coverage I can afford. I’m going to therapy because I have coverage and can afford it now.

I don’t look anywhere in particular. *My hands are shaking… Why are my hands shaking… I wish they would stop.* I stare ahead at the street in front of me, and I glance back at the metallic bottom edge of the window. In my out of focus gaze, I see navy sweatshirt-ed sleeves hanging still, As if the corners of time have begun to get wrinkly around the edges. My hands still shake, I wait for my change and take the bills and shove them in my purse. I feel like a puppet, dull and lifeless, moving only because the interaction requires it. Inside I am hollow and empty and cold, and there’s a void clawing up my throat and into my sinuses, making my eyes sting. I feel the cold plastic cup press into my hands, and a straw appears in my vision shortly after. I shake myself lucid and push against the gas harder than I expect to and drive off, my entire body reeling with tremors as if I had just touched a livewire, yet I watch my hands tremble like leaves in the wind as they move to turn the wheel with the deep knowing that there’s no real reason for them to be shaking at all. I’m completely safe, besides the fact that I’m driving, but I have enough faith in my driving abilities at this point that I don’t mind it. There’s music blasting, and I know later in the day I’ll start to feel alright again.

1ht20pp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ht20pp,Modified TCD experiment,"Hey guys, been lurking this sub for awhile but haven’t made a post before. Sorry for the long post but I think I’ve come up with a really interesting modification to TCD and I think some of you may be interested in my theory and the results of my experiment. 

For some background I am male in my 20s and I am about 30-40lbs overweight. Like a lot of you I have struggled with weight loss in recent years. TCD was the best I ever felt diet wise and it felt optimal for energy, enjoyment, hormone support and satiety. I did a very white flour; sugar, dairy and potatoe based version of TCD like many of you may have. Unfortunately, I couldn’t lose weight on the diet after an initial few pound drop. I decided yesterday to try a modified version of TCD but with 2 major differences: (1) keeping a positive ratio of calcium to phosphorus i.e. in calcium’s favor (2) More sugar than starch based- but not excluding either 

This has translated to basing my diet mainly around milk, cheese, tropical fruits/juices and masa harina (traditional made corn flour with trace of lime). Main fats are the dairy fat I get from milk and cheese + plenty of added butter and some added coconut oil. I also get some additional variety and nutrients coming from eggs, beef and shellfish, but I don’t go overboard with them as they have a poor Ca:P ratio.

You may have also noticed a very heavy Ray Peat influence if you are familiar with his work. I am a big fan of his also and he is where the idea of Ca:P ratio got on my radar in the first place. The previous version of TCD I was doing , when I went back to chronometer I realized it was, in fact, a negative Ca:P ratio I.e. in phosphorus’ favor. I know a lot of people have focused in on protein being a culprit or have moved to HCLFLP. I never felt quite right on either variation so I am going to try to test another variable with the whole calcium thing. 

The original TCD macros Brad mentioned for people who don’t know or forgot are:
42% carbs 
40% fat 
18% protein

I attached my chronometer results from today. 

My meals were- 

Breakfast
-Egg fried in butter and made into tacos + OJ + coffee

Between meals 
-Carrot salad (shredded carrots, coco oil, vinegar and salt 

Lunch
Very large smoothie made with milk, frozen OJ concentrate, collagen and frozen pineapples

Dinner
Cheese Quesadillas fried in butter 

Before bed
milk 

You could of course add a calcium supplement to your routine to make the ratio more favorable. Some advantages of the style I am testing imo are that for some people fruits digest better than starch but going starch free or sugar free isn’t ideal for digestion. For me I feel best with mostly fruit and lactose for carbs with some starch mixed in. Good quality masa is also well digested for many people and it has a better Ca:P ratio than other starches. I also like how nutrient dense this TCD variation is with easy to digest simple carbs still but not from so much low nutrient white flour and white sugar.  

Just wanted to share my experiment I’m trying and I will update in a month. Feel free to suggest anything I should add or change anything !

TL:DR; 
Trying a version of TCD with a calcium to phosphorus ratio in calcium’s favor and  a high(er) sugar intake relative to starch.
