I recently graduated May 2024 with my BS in business administration with an emphasis in design. I have one internship under my belt plus some retail experience. I feel like a complete failure right now. I’m not sure what’s going on in my life I feel so lost. I apply to every kind of job I see (over 400+)I landed some interviews but never heard back for a second round (2weeks ago). I’m not sure how much strength I have left in me. I’ve optimized and tailored my resume as much as I can. I coffee chat with people who are kind enough to accept my requests on LinkedIn. I just feel completely paralyzed. I feel like a burden to my family and my siblings. Nothing feels right anymore. I don’t know what career path to choose and what I like.

- I wake up around 7:30, my husband and baby are up for an hour by then
- We make breakfast and eat together and after that I drink coffee and read a book while my LO plays around me (found a toy that occupies her attention for full 15 minutes! Or she just walks around the house exploring, with a piece of bread in her hand😂)
- Her grandmas come around 9:30 and take her out for her first nap in stroller, and I work and have meetings till 1pm
- She comes back and we have lunch together and play a bit
- Then she goes to sleep and I try to chill, watch a TV show or read 
- When she wakes up around 4pm my energy levels are so low, so I've decided to start using that time to clean up a bit, so I don't die from how tired I am. LO tries to help so it's super cute
- We go out together once again for a walk or to a park
- Dad's back from work around 6pm so we have dinner and then play together with the LO
- Bed time around 7:30pm, I usually read while she's nursing to sleep
- After she's down, I hang out with my husband and do some remaining work or whatch netflix.
- I try to go to bed a bit earlier so I'm in bed by 10pm even though I usually can't fall asleep immediately, so I read a bit more.",1,1739347563.0,AttachmentParenting,0,1.0,False

I have an older machine BES875 which came with a cleaning disc that has a hole. Apparently new ones have a cleaning disc without one. An adjustment made to better back flush during ""clean me"" cycle. Seems like cleaning with tablet only is preferable for the former, tablet and powder for the latter. 

This has created some confusion since water won't come out of portafilter if you have a cleaning disc with no hole in it. So I suppose I have to switch back to tablets instead of using cleaning powder?! 🙄🤷‍♂️

1inm2g4,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1inm2g4/starbucks_in_australia_and_the_great_failure_a/,Starbucks in Australia and the Great Failure (A bit of corporate arrogance?),"In Australia we don't have too many Starbucks, but it's an icon of the U.S., obviously well known by many.  
One of the reasons they failed in Australia was that they figured they could do whatever they wanted, because they were a big, huge, corporation and they had lots of money involved to back the venture and do the take over bid.

But they found out that Australians don't work that way, and they couldn't just barge on in and set up shop and be uber successful in a takeover of a quite well established cafe culture with different preferences and traditions.

After having tried out in some Australian cities for some years, they were met over that time with basically a ""meh"" response to their supposed impressive callibre of coffee and culture. In around 2007-2008 it closed around 3/4 of its stores. Again, nobody really seemed to care. We had better cafes to enjoy and a rich coffee culture (especially Melbourne, which is well known for it).

First time I saw a Starbucks in my city of Sydney at the time, around early 2000s, I said out loud ""what the f\*\*\* is THAT doing here?"", as I spied it across the road from our city's central parkland while waiting for a 301 bus.

Australia has had a strong culture of independent cafes and coffee shops for quite a long time. That's for both sit-in and takeaway. Enter Starbucks. Meh. Nobody cared all that much.

Independent cafes and stores are, overall, the preferred domain for our coffee consumption. And there are many.

So, when I see that Starbucks is again trying for a slice of the Australian coffee culture business, I hope they fail again. There is a push that apparently more people want them now than before - unless that's just marketing, which is could be. Partly that may be driven by social media and influencer culture.

I hope that independent coffee makers and cafes continue to flourish and succeed in Australia, because the massive corporate American thing is not as good as localised, independent companies and businesses thriving, I believe.

Currently, according to Scrape Hero data, there are now only 69 Starbucks in Australia. And these are all located in three major cities: Melbourne (what?), Sydney, and Brisbane.

So if anyone is interested in why corporate businesses don't always work, there is a message in the Starbucks Australian failure to launch successfully.  
They didn't read the room, as it were, or the market. They assumed that Starbucks would be the takeover and go-to favourite of coffee lovers all over. Because, they were resting on their established reputation elsewhere. But overall, Australians didn't prefer the weak American coffee. Our coffee culture came predominantly from the Immigrant Italian and Greek cafes cultures from mid 20th C.

I prefer my cafe coffee strong, not weak, and preferable from an inde cafe whether that's to take out or sit in.

I'm not saying I'm perfect or that Australia is either. But I kind of hate Starbucks (the company, corporate stuff, not the workers) tbh.

Some of us are kind of proud that Starbucks failed here. More of it, I say. I hope they don't start to get a foothold though, as they are trying again for a bigger slice of the market now that some years have passed.

Note: Why I am posting this on the AntiWork sub, is that there was some discussion of Starbucks as a  corporation at various times, and of it being part of the capitalist blabla machine.  
And this aspect of its failure is a fairly uniquely Australian experience of that corporation and something some of us quite enjoy to see in some way.  
Please don't shoot me (we have gun laws here too).

I'll say, ""no thanks, I'm good."" 

They will say ""sure? I've got tea or coffee?"" 

So i say, ""yeah I'm good. Thank you for the offer though""

Someone will always come back with ""what is it with this generation not having a brew"" and its like just move on with your life, it really doesn't affect you if I don't drink tea or coffee, like come on, so annoying.

Me and my partner are one of the top ice dance teams in the Netherlands. If all goes to plan we have the chance to qualify for the big international tournaments and championships next year.
We even might be able to get a spot for the Olympics, making us the first ever Dutch ice dance team to qualify for the Olympic Games!
There are two other teams we need to skate against here nationally, and we seem to have a pretty good shot at winning the national title next season!

At the moment we are preparing for that season. From this month on to August is all about preparation. We are working on new elements and our new programs (competition choreographies).

Even though the Netherlands is well known for skating, our federation doesn’t fund figure skating (all of its budget goes to speed skating), leaving us to fend for ourselves. We pay everything out of our own pocket, and with the help of our friends and family.
But, sadly, funds are running low and it might jeopardize our chance to fulfill our dreams!

We hope to find some supporters here on Reddit! Even if it be one or two, every donation, big or small, helps us!

Would you please consider our crowdfunding page on “buy me a coffee”? And see if you can spare us any support on our way to write Dutch ice dance history.

A knife from the knife block disappeared for a few months, then returned in a load of dishes. I lived alone, no one else could have found it and put it with the dirty dishes. My keys disappeared one day, forcing me to call in to work or be locked out of my apartment building. They returned the next morning, under the book I had read the night before and left open on the coffee table. Impossible for them to have been there when I set the book down. But nothing like this has happened for a few years.

Today I wanted my earbud to keep me occupied while folding laundry. I remembered it was on the kitchen counter. Went to the kitchen, and saw my earbud clearly. I reached for it, and bumped it with my fingers so it slid away. When I looked again, it was gone.

I've cleaned off the counter. Checked inside everything that was on the counter, even if it wasn't nearby. I checked the floor, and in the cupboards. The sink is on the other side of the kitchen, so it didn't go down the drain. I've scoured my kitchen, and there's no sign of it. I clearly remember seeing it, and touching it, but now I'm gaslighting myself into thinking I saw something else, even though there wasn't anything even vaguely resembling my earbud nearby.

1inlqq1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BollyBlindsNGossip/comments/1inlqq1/updates_and_coffee/,Updates and coffee,"This year Atlee got a harsh reality check with Baby John. He now knows that Jawan was a product curated by King Khan's Red Chillies and micro managed by them . 

He was just a senior technician of that film with an appealing CV to headline the project . The rights of the story  were bought by Khan , the planning was done by his team , he officially appointed Atlee for the job in 2019 right after Zero's debacle . 

Post Zero , King khan walked out of , Rakesh Sharma biopic , Saare Jahaan se Accha. The project was just about to go on floors at that point.

Aamir khan was the first choice for this project but eventually it went to Shah Rukh Khan . After Shah Rukh Khan decided to not do the project , he personally contacted Salman Khan and suggested him to do the film for Ronnie and Roy Kapur . But that did not workout as Salman was in talks with Bhansali for an ambitious project . 


Red Chillies Entertainment's Jawan went through many screenplay changes over time . Karan Johar and Farah Khan played  a big role in making the film more entertaining . That said Shah Rukh Khan was impressed with the background score but wasn't too pleased by the songs and that's when Red Chillies came up with their last minute  chartbuster of the album . Because of this Anirudha has deep respect for Srk . 


Now after a long gap ,  Baby John was the first independent all Atlee project which was micro managed by him without any guidance and support. He was expecting to hit atleast a 150 crore mark . With this level of failure , he is  totally out of place and has burnt his hands  and confidence.

Atlee's next official big directorial is a massive 750 crore budget film which would be reported as a 400-500 crore biggie in the media . The movie requires two actors . Main lead and the second lead . Allu Arjun was always the first choice for Atlee's next after Jawaan but when he found out about the idea of a second lead , he backed out . 

 Sun pictures and another production house were ready to invest around 550 crores on  Ranbir Kapoor after Allu Arjun made an exit from the film . The second lead was supposed to be a small  south star at that point . Ranbir wasn't completely sure about this  project and had asked Atlee to come up with some developments in the script and meet him after Animal's release . But he eventually picked Bhansali's film over Atlee. 
So with Allu Arjun and Ranbir's refusal at that point , the project went to Salman Khan and Ranveer Singh was supposed to be the second lead at this point. 

 But It was impossible to get 700+ budget under Salman Khan's brand with his present market value , which is why they wanted to get Rajinikanth on board along with him . But there were a lot problems with the casting of the second lead . After Pushpa 2, Allu Arjun again showed interest in this project and Ranveer Singh is once  again being considered to play the second lead . We don't have the complete idea about the nature of these characters.

There is also this murmur about it being the same Shah Rukh and Joseph Vijay ,two hero project . Which is how Atlee tried to market with Salman and Rajinikanth's combination but failed again . 

Like a lot of their previous films including Pushpa 2 ,Allu Arjun's home production is going to take the creative lead of this new Atlee collaboration and would provide guidance and input . They have a lot of writers and directors who over the years have taken the  creative charge  and have also co produced his films .

I need advice about a Taurus girl in my life. This will probably be a long one because I want to give deets, so I apologize in advance but appreciate your insight <3. I can't tell by her interactions if she genuinely felt anything between us but my gut says yes. I'll leave that you y'all to let me know what you think.

I'm a Scorpio female, she's a Taurus, and we've gotten to know each other through university. We had a class together in 2023 when I first noticed her but never had a reason to talk. I obviously thought she was very pretty and the calm/kind energy she radiated caught my attention too. I'd constantly catch her staring at me in class. We barely interacted but were were sometimes surrounded by the same people we both knew.

Fast forward to Fall 2024 term, we had a lab class together and were in the same group with three other girls. Since the class was interactive, it gave us a chance to get to know each other better. We had two other classes together, also with our three other lab partners, but they were lectures so we couldn't talk much, but we still did. Also, she has a gf but I didn't know that until probably a month into the term.

It started when our professor graded homework and emailed the class saying if you didn't get a grade, it may because you got flagged for AI. We both didn't, and she was anxious all lab. After class, I texted her asking if she's okay since she seemed nervous. I reassured her that our teacher is understanding and not to worry. She said I'm so sweet and asked how I'm feeling too. Before this interaction, we had small ones like me opening the door for her and her saying thank you so much sweetie. She also touched my arm a few times in lab while talking to me. The eye contact was also there, and I felt like when we talked, our energy or tension was different than how it felt with other girls in our lab group. Idk how to describe it.

Eventually she adds me on snapchat and I snap her. This was around midterms, and I think I sent her a pic that says I'm so cooked. She replied offering to study with her at school, but I politely declined (keeping it mysterious). She said if I changed my mind the offer is still there. Throughout the term, there'd be times I'd catch her looking at me. Like when our teacher asked us to partner up with someone to discuss a topic, I caught her looking at me twice, then looked away when I saw her.

Throughout the term we'd talk on snap more, but it was always me initiating it. We'd send pictures, which slowly turned into sometimes sending mini vlogs and talking that way. I tried to be more friendly so for example, there was a point where the weather was so bad so I snapped her saying be careful since the conditions sucked and she's a further drive to school. She again called me sweet and we started talking about other things. I offered her my notes from a course I've taken and that she was currently in. When i did this, she called me sweet thang (lol) and said I'm a sweet angel. She said she owes me, I replied saying you don't owe me anything ever, then she sent a pic of her blowing a kiss and drew hearts all around. Next day in class, she walks behind my chair and puts her hand on my back as she walked by. When I glanced up, she turned back and smiled.

A week later on my birthday she said “HAPPY BIRTHDAY 😻🤍🫶🏼🤪😘🫣🥳”. She also said happy birthday in class and put her hand on my arm when saying it. Next day in class she put her hand on my arm again asking what I did. I'm thinking at this point, she thinks I'm sweet, I've caught her looking at me, she's making small physical touch. When we spoke in person, it just felt like there was underlying attraction there.

She once said how she grew up in a small town with a lot of closed minded people, didn't grow up around gay people, POC, etc. Since we were walking to our cars with other people, I didn't ask much but afterwards I messaged her asking how that was for her growing up, being gay in a small community where people wouldn't accept you. I told her if that was too personal that she wouldn't have to share but she was receptive and told me about her background/time growing up. Other interactions was her offering me to stay at her house when I told her I was annoyed that a family member was gonna stay with us for a few months. Walked by me in class while we were both standing and put her hand on my mid back. There was a time I noticed her at school during her 4hr gap between classes. Since I lived close, I went home until I had to come back for lab so I asked her if she wanted me to bring her anything. She again called me sweet, thanked me.

She followed me first on instagram at this time. I also know she has a gf at this point. We snapped more, our videos became more frequent and responses were quick. We had many positive interactions beyond this point.

Towards the end of the term, like end of November, she didn't open my snap for like 4 days, and then when I left her on delivered for like ten hours before responding, she replied immediately and continued replying within literally seconds of me sending something. I even sent just pics cause maybe she thought the amount of videos we sent were overwhelming, but she'd reply with videos.

Fast forward to start of December, exam season. We planned to study for our exam together once I finished an exam for another class. Before I went to her, I got two flavors of vitamin water, one for her and me. I told her I brought her one but didn't know which flavor she liked so I got orange for her immune system since she was sick, and another in case she didn't like orange. She called me sweet like five times. We started studying, our friend joined us. After some time, me and her were over it while our other friend was locked in. We started talking lots, had sarcastic banter, I made her laugh and the overall vibe was playful. There was even a window that led to the roof that we debated going on. She ended up doing it and got stuck so I had to pull her up. We were just being goofy. We also talked about how I might be moving in 2025 to another province, she said she was thinking of moving there too for her masters.

On another day we planned to study, she texted me in the morning asking if I wanted anything from a coffee shop. I said no but thank you so much and she replied okayyyy<3. Later we snapped more and she called me pookie. On a completely different day where we didn't plan to study, she texted only me from our lab group asking if I was studying at school. I said yes and asked if she wants me to bring her anything she said you're so sweet and too kind to me. I said let me know if anything changes and she said thanks bb.

We finished our final exam and afterwards I snapped her saying I lowkey feel bummed classes are ending since I feel like there wasn't enough time for us to get to know each other more, especially if i move. She said she never thinks of that and is usually just hyped another term ended. She also said she thought to herself ""is this the last time I'm going to see her"". She also said on the same video ""I know for your sake you have to move but for my sake I don't want you to"". I felt like this was a pretty intense thing to say considering she has a gf, and it just further made me think maybe she is interested.

After this interaction, she started taking longer to reply, it was around the holidays when she visited back home with her gf. It was like a week that she left me on delivered until she replied and apologized. We kinda had phases since then where she'd reply, we'd send videos, and then she'd leave me on delivered for a while again, like a week, a few times a bit longer.

We started the new term in January 2025 and when she finally did reply to one of my snaps, we started talking about classes. She said she'd see me later in one cause she thinks I'm in it (I wasn't, we don't even have any classes this term). I replied saying we don't but if she ever wants to hang to let me know. I jokingly added I wouldn't ask first out of fear because she told me once that she likes to go home after work/school to shower and see her gf. She replied asking me to send my schedule, said we can plan to hang and that she only said she goes home because she never has anything to do. She said if she had plans, she'd of course stay. She said she'd love to hang and that she's scared to ask to hang so if I text her, she'll text me. I told her it's intimidating for me since she has a gf, her set group of friends, and busy with work/school. She said ""don't be scared, please ask me, if I ever say no it's not because I don't want to because I do. Sometimes I don't have a lot of time but i do want to.""

Fast forward to end of January and the last time we talked, she said that she slept with an open mouth so her throat hurt. I playfully replied saying she did sound sick but on the plus, a raspy voice is hot on anyone. I also talked about some other things that were in response to what she said. When she replied, it seemed low energy and she said something like sorry there was a lot in that. Since then, she's left my snap on delivered. It's been 3 weeks and it sucks because I genuinely like her. I know she has a gf, I wouldn't cross boundaries, but I selfishly wish she'd talk to me. I swear I felt something from her end too, but this radio silence now makes me confused.

Idk if she was only being nice to me throughout this entire time, or if she felt the same attraction/connection that I did and didn't know how to feel internally because she has a gf so she pulled back. Maybe her gf thinks we've talked too much and asked her to stop talking to me, maybe she felt like replying to so many videos became a chore (but she could've easily just started replying with pics, I would've matched her energy). I really don't know..

I can't help but feel like if she didn't want anything to do with me, or felt no attraction, there wouldn't be so many signs that would lead me to believe she did feel something. I also don't think my gut would be so sure that I felt that between us.

Based on her zodiac and what I've shared, do you think her interactions were something more than platonic? What do you think could've been the reason she went ghost?

My hobbies include:

Bike riding 80-100 km a day (usually all over Burnaby and Downtown Vancouver/Stanley Park

1 hour of gym per day but it doesn't seem like a great place to meet people

drop in ice hockey

hiking the grouse but when it's nicer weather

golfing

Tennis

I like to grow orchids (I really like my orchid)

I also do mountain biking

I go to the range to shoot off .22's.

I started to pick up boxing again so hopefully my local boxing gym I may be able to find some like minded folks.

  
I'm starting to think maybe I'm the common denominator for the reason I'm not winning over any new people? According to reddit I have significant self-confidence issues and need to seek therapy. So there's that too.

There is always something to do together and no one loses on it. It's a game where you can just do the most casual chill thing ever after a hard day of work. It's a game that you can play with family even if your skill level is lightyears above your kid's or your partner's, because the game offers everything from very easy and casual content to sweaty content that you can play without expecting them to perform the same. It offers a lot in terms of connecting with people, things to do, account progression and so on. I can't name another game that does everything gw2 does.

I completely understand that 10-20 bucks may be a lot for some people. I'm glad that people in not-so-good financial situations can enjoy this game for a one-time purchase. For others, 10-20 bucks might be the cost of eating out one time a month. One pizza, kebab or fast food meal that you would have to skip to buy yourself 800-1600 gems and get some more QoL or a nice skin.

While some may think you can just grind gold to gems, this game is far from being as predatory as a lot of MMOs.

No in-game ""buy gems now to speed up"" or such.  
No constant reminders that there are ""sales"" in the cash shop.  
No shoving things down your throat because apparently you can't live without *that 24/7 buff*.  
No artificial problems every patch just to sell a new cash shop item.  
The list goes on.

This game is one of those where you don't have to feel bad about spending a little money on it. Especially if you consider how many hundreds of hours of actual ***unrepetitive*** content it gives you.

So if you eat out a lot, drive a lot, buy a lot of snacks, buy coffee out a lot or whatever else that you do frequently and costs you money... Consider skipping it once or twice, so you can contribute to the health, longevity and quality of the game by spending 10-20 bucks a month.

That's it for me. I know this will be sour for some people, but I am also hoping at least someone agrees with me and that at least someone considers this.

1inlj5j,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_GasLate4439/comments/1inlj5j/medtech_excellero_review_system/,MEDTECH EXCELLERO REVIEW SYSTEM,"Hello from province here who enrolled in Excellero Manila Branch! I will take the MLTE this March 2025! I would just like to share about this review center because they are really a topnotch and chef's kiss in terms of lectures and care for their enrollees!!!

Refresher Courses: These are notes given by Excellero before the start of the actual class. Like upon downpayment magbibigay sila ng notes and recorded lecture videos na you can watch on your own pace. May schedule na ibibigay para may guide ka at meron ring mga assessment exams at ratio every after subject. From the name itself, refresher course, para iboost ulit yuhg napagaralan during the Bachelor years. Kumbaga start up guide before the official lectures. Although hindi ko naopen to kasi I thought kaya pa icram by the end of the ftf class HAHAHAHA!

Mother Notes and Lecturers: Grabe complete na lahat and most of the lecturers are of the National One's. Sobrang siksik ng notes and madaling intindihin plus ang gagaling pa ng mga lecturer. Ipapaintindi talaga nila sayo yung topics and if kinakailangan, nagaadjust sila sa discussion according to the pace of students. Hindi fast paced and very convenient to sa mga students like me na medyo mabagal ang learning style at hindi ganun kaganda ang foundation sa mga subjects. Really, grabe walang masabi!

Final Coaching Notes: OMG!!! THE BEST! Ang galing ni Sir Jericho magturo ng CC, MicroPara, at CM!! Top notch lecturer ever and grabe ang care niya about the student's understanding sa topics! To think ang taas ng rating niya sa CC during their board exam days like 97%??? For real mas magiging maganda pa ang foundation mo sa mga subjects lalo na ang galing galing niya magturo! Pagsamahin mo mother notes from Excellero tapos Final Coaching Notes, boogsh, ang ganda na ng foundation mo! Hindi nakakaoverwhelm ang pagtuturo niya and other lecturers sa final coaching. Final coaching notes is hindi lang siya Q and A kasi as in idiscuss lahat ng need idiscuss. Complete and very informative

Grand Final Coaching: Mga notes dito ay tabulated form na and ito na yung pinasiksik na mga recalls and topics na high yield sa board exam! This will serve as additional info sa Final Coaching Notes! Grabe rin pagtuturo dito at ipapaintindi talaga! Top tier at magagamit mo talaga pag nagcracram ka na kasi one glance andun na lahat ng info!

Enhancement Notes: These are additional notes na like reinforcement of the Mother Notes pero with a twist! Hindi siya in sentence form but in a tabulated form. Then question answer and type niya with explanation. This is thru online mode which is good kasi after a long tiring ftf classes, finally sa bahay/apartment ka lang tapos watch ka lang ng recorded video.

Assessment Exams and Ratio: Kering keri ang assessment exams! Madali siya kung nagbasa ka ahhahaha and di mo grasp ang topic, meron namang Ratio. Ang ratio nila ay umaabot ng 4 hrs per subject which is good for me kasi naeexplain talaga ng maayos ang topics na hindi ka pa well-versed! Ang nagraratio usually ay Doctors and Latin Honor students!

Pre boards: Surprise na lang to pero one thing, MAHIRAP ANG PRE BOARDS NILA HUHUHU. Pero iraratio yan ng maayos! 

Schedule: One thing I like about Excellero ay hindi siksik ang sched. Balance ang pasok sa review center at may breaks in between. Like after 4 days lecture sa isang subject, may 4 days na rest/self study days and after that, assessment exam na. As for me na mas nakakareview if I self- study and read notes on my own, I really like the pacing of the schedule. Mababalance mo ang life and study mo in which is good for the mental health. Hindi pinilit ang schedule para lang matapos within a time frame. Well-planned ang sched!!! Maayos!

Venue: TOP TIER VENUE!!! ANG CONDUCIVE NG ENVIRONMENT VERY MODERN AND ANG LAMIG LAMIG! Di rin projector ang gamit kundi TV!!! 4 TVs!!! May free water pa kasi may water dispenser na provided by the RC, free coffee etc etc. Grabe ang generous nila magbigay ng necessities rin. May pakain pa!!! Like from the staffs of Excellero.

Staff: One thing about them, sila ay caring, thoughtful, considerate, at kind. Never saw other RC staff na ganun. Malapit sila sa students at higit sa lahat grabe sila maghandle. May palaro at papremyong pera minsan pag nakikita na nilang stressed and students! Hahaha! May pa Xmas party pa at sandamakmak ng papremyo! And nagbibigay sila ng Board Exam kits na pwedeng magamit during the board exam! The best! They treat us like family hindi lang reviewees! THE BEST!

Over all Rating: 1Million/10. I highly recommended Excellero as your Review Center for MTLE!! Grabe! Alagang alaga ka intellectually, emotionally, and spiritually! ",1,1739344978.0,u_GasLate4439,0,1.0,False

Suddenly I realise that it is not so bad.

My first job was in home care, it was stressful as all hell and the pay was abysmal. There was little to no room for actual coffee breaks or some days even a proper lunchbreak. You got 30 minutes of lunch per day but if the alarm went off and a caretaker needed help you had to drop everything and go there immediately. All my colleagues were middle aged women who were all talking trash behind eachothers back. I was at that job for 6 months.

The next job was at a carshop where it was much of the same stress as in home care. A jam packed schedule everyday and if a customer walked in the door during your 30 minute lunchbreak the boss expected you to help them on the spot, even if you were eating. Much as the previous job everyone in the staff was fighting all the time, just with the difference that they were screaming directly at eachother instead of throwing shade at eachother behind eachouthers back. The difference here was of course that the workforce all constisted of middle-aged men instead of middle-aged women. The boss at this place was an emotional wreck who solved all his problems by screaming at, and blaming the staff under him, it was hell. When you arrived at work 06:00 in the morning you didn´t even get a proper ""good morning"", you just got dealt the first carkeys of the day and were expected to get to it. I worked there for a little over a year.

I got tons and tons of more examples of different jobs I´ve had which all more or less, sucked the life out of me.  
Sooner or later I realised that I can´t keep working jobs like these for 50 more years and I need to do something else. I couldn´t see myself dragging myself through this all the way to retirement.

After some hard work I managed to land an office job and now I finally get the feeling ""okay, now I understand how people can work all their life without wanting to kill themselves"".

This job is a dream come true for me, sad as it sounds.

I can sit in a nicely decorated office with air condition. I can listen to music while sitting comfortably at my computer in a comfortable chair. I can dress however I want, I can work from home whenever I want. The pay is good. The boss is a great guy and he doesn´t micro-manage you at all.

I stumbled upon a reel by that k-bye guy. Basically soak some dates in warm milk and then blend them once cooled with some vanilla essence.

My first attempt was a bit to in your face with the dates flavour so i froze it and added some more fresh cream to it in the morning and blended it again and froze it. This time, the ice-cream came out perfect, tasty as hell on its own.

Received the beans yesterday, so for my mid day coffee I had to experiment as well.

Brewed the WAC 2019 Winner recipe(my daily driver), and instead of adding hot water at the end mixed the date ice-cream and some chocolate ice-cream, and some cocoa powder to hide my inept presentation skills.

Its a lot of work, but I think would remake this one. 7/10

You know, those sneaky thieves who can steal your credit card info without even touching your wallet? Yeah, it sounds like something out of a spy movie, but apparently, it’s a real thing. I decided to look into it after a friend had her card info stolen at a crowded mall. She didn’t even realize it happened until her bank called about suspicious charges. That got me thinking—how safe is my wallet, really?

After some digging, I stumbled across **SafeCard**, an RFID-blocking card that claims to protect your credit cards, IDs, and even passports from digital theft. I was skeptical at first—how can a tiny card stop hackers? But I figured it was worth a shot. Here’s my honest take after using it for a few weeks.

# What Is SafeCard, and How Does It Work?

SafeCard is a slim, credit-card-sized device that fits right into your wallet. It uses **RFID-blocking technology** to create a shield around your cards, preventing hackers from scanning them remotely. If you’ve got contactless credit cards, a smart passport, or even an ID with an RFID chip, you’re potentially at risk. Skimmers can use hidden scanners to steal your data from several feet away—no physical contact needed. Scary, right?

The idea behind SafeCard is simple: it blocks those signals, so your data stays safe. It doesn’t require batteries or charging, and it’s designed to last for years. I liked that it wasn’t some bulky wallet or sleeve—just a thin card I could slide right in with my other stuff.

# My First Impressions

When my SafeCard arrived, I was surprised by how lightweight and slim it was. It’s about the same size as a credit card and only 1.1mm thick. I slid it into my wallet next to my cards and forgot about it. That’s one thing I appreciated—it didn’t add any bulk or require me to change my routine.

I decided to test it out in a few scenarios where I’d heard skimming was common: crowded malls, public transit, and even at a busy coffee shop. I also took it with me on a weekend trip to see how it held up while traveling.

# Real-World Testing: Did It Work?

**1. Crowded Malls and Public Transit**  
I’ll admit, I was a little paranoid at first. Every time someone got too close to me, I wondered if they were trying to scan my cards. But after a few days, I started to relax. SafeCard gave me peace of mind, especially in crowded places like malls and subway stations. I didn’t notice any issues with my cards, and no suspicious charges popped up on my bank statements.

**2. Traveling**  
This is where SafeCard really shined. I took it with me on a weekend trip, and it was a game-changer. Airports and train stations are hotspots for skimmers, and I’ve heard horror stories about people getting their passports scanned without even knowing it. With SafeCard in my wallet, I felt a lot more secure. I didn’t have to worry about my passport or credit cards being compromised while I was rushing through security or waiting in line.

**3. Everyday Use**  
Even in less risky situations, like grabbing coffee or running errands, SafeCard gave me an extra layer of security. It’s one of those things you don’t think about until something goes wrong, but having it there made me feel more in control of my privacy.

# What I Liked About SafeCard

* **No Hassle**: It’s super easy to use—just slide it into your wallet and forget about it.
* **Durable**: It’s made from tear-proof and waterproof materials, so it can handle daily wear and tear.
* **Discreet**: It doesn’t draw attention or add bulk to your wallet.
* **Long-Lasting**: No batteries or charging required—it works 24/7.

# What Could Be Improved

While I’m happy with SafeCard, it’s not perfect. For one, it only protects the cards it’s next to. If you’ve got a lot of cards in your wallet, you might need more than one. Also, it doesn’t protect against all forms of theft—like if someone physically steals your wallet. But for RFID skimming, it does exactly what it promises.

# Is SafeCard Worth It?

If you’re someone who carries contactless cards, a smart passport, or an RFID-enabled ID, I’d say it’s definitely worth considering. It’s an affordable way to add an extra layer of security to your everyday life. Plus, it’s a lot cheaper than replacing stolen funds or dealing with identity theft.

I’d especially recommend it for frequent travelers or people who live in busy urban areas where skimming is more common. It’s one of those things you hope you’ll never need, but it’s nice to have just in case.

# Where to Get SafeCard

If you’re interested in trying SafeCard for yourself, you can check it out [**here**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2HHSWZC4/?uid=32807&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/CoolNewGadgets). They’re running a limited-time discount, so it’s a good time to grab one. I also found this [**alternative link**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2HHSWZC4/?uid=32806&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/CoolNewGadgets) if the first one doesn’t work.

# Final Thoughts

Overall, I’m really glad I gave SafeCard a try. It’s not a magic solution, but it’s a simple and effective way to protect yourself from digital theft. If you’re like me and value your privacy, it’s a small investment for a lot of peace of mind. Plus, it’s way cheaper than dealing with the fallout of having your data stolen.

Have any of you tried SafeCard or something similar? I’d love to hear your experiences in the comments!

1inlc1r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cholesterol/comments/1inlc1r/high_ldl_is_a_marker_for_longevity/,High LDL is a marker for longevity?,"I'm late 30's, 5'9'', 180lb, relatively fit, relatively active, eat a decent diet (maybe heavy on the cheese and eggs) but I rarely eat fast food or much processed food outside of crackers and bread. I also have been doing intermittent fasting for several years, typically only eating between 2 and 4pm to around 10 to midnight with the exception of coffee throughout the day (lately it's been about 8 cups of coffee with whole milk) 

I just had a cholesterol test done and my numbers are:  
  
Total: 258  
Triglycerides: 112  
HDL: 50  
LDL: 184  
Non-HDL: 208

So I immediate stopped eating almost all cheese, added butter, eggs, and milk... replaced the coffee with a single cup of green tea and ramped up the oats and fruits and started having smoothies again (home made, blueberries, strawberries, banana, chia/flax/hemp seed mix, whey, and spinach) 

My daily diet is roughly 2500-2700 calories, \~120-150 grams of protein, 90-100 grams of fat with 20-30 grams of saturated fat, 50-60 grams of sugar (lots of fruit), and 240-280 grams of carbs

Definitely kind of shocked but both my parents have been on statins for years, so it's likely a genetic component but the triglycerides and hdl levels seem to indicate a good diet, from what I've been reading.

But as my research has ramped up I stumbled across this podcast: [https://open.spotify.com/episode/0WaN6h4lJj10UmuhOTlkBE?si=ERDlTzwBTTCFRU8ReLCzaA](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0WaN6h4lJj10UmuhOTlkBE?si=ERDlTzwBTTCFRU8ReLCzaA)

It suggests that high LDL isn't necessarily a bad thing and could actually be a marker for longevity as it's necessary for immune responses and also that LDL build up could be a form of self repair to arteries that are otherwise damaged or compromised in some way and it's existence has been misinterpreted as a cause for problems rather than a symptom of a different problem. 

I thought this was kind of interesting and it seems like there's a lot of research that indicates that High LDL isn't necessarily a precursor to CAD or heart attacks.... similarly, it seems like just as many people who have heart attacks have normal or good cholesterol levels as do people with elevated levels. 

Obviously I'm now based in that I would love if high LDL was a marker for longevity but is there any merit to that or just wishful thinking?",1,1739344119.0,Cholesterol,5,1.0,False

1inlb21,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1inlb21,A humble Valentine’s Day cookie box,"Ever since I saw everyone’s post here on Christmas with all those nice cookie boxes I knew I wanted to do something similar, so I took the opportunity to make a cookie box for my husband as Valentine’s gift. Since life happens and we won’t be able to celebrate on Friday (and afterwards we are going on holiday) I gave it to him yesterday. This is my first cookie box! It’s very humble as I did not have practice or enough recipes for my baking level. The space left in the box is for the big heart cookie!

I give you here a breakdown of what’s each thing with link or reference to the recipes:

Picture 5: Peanut butter and jelly buttons, from ‘The Cookie Bible’ by Rose Berambaum. 

This were selected as my husband is a big fan of peanut flavor, and this do taste like a dollop of peanut butter. I did half of them with the jelly jam and half with chocolate. I suspect I let the sour cherry jelly jam thicken more than needed so the texture is more like a bit of toffee, but flavor wise is very interesting because the sour profile of the jelly goes really well with the peanut butter. They were surprisingly easy to make and also the freeze really well once baked, definitely a plus.

Picture 6: Pecan Sandies, from ‘Bravetart. Iconic American Desserts’ by Stella Parks.

These were difficult because it was my first time making brown butter (but somehow pulled it off) and also the cookie dough was quite hard to work with. However, it paid off because they are by far the best cookies in this box, in my opinion. The flavour is amazingly nutty and rich, and my husband was really happy since he is a big fan of pecans too! Totally will make them again, they are wonderfully crunchy too and go so well with  either coffee or tea. I froze them once they were shaped, thawed overnight and baked them they day of, and I think it was wise since they were much easier to manipulate.

Picture 7: Red Velvet Hearts, based on the ‘Red Velvet Pan-Banging Cookies’ from The Vanilla Bean Blog (will post a comment with the link) 

I wanted to love these but I didn’t. They have the Valentine’s vibe because I tweaked the aesthetic to fit the theme by shaping them just out of the oven, but compared to the two previous cookies they are more ‘one-note’ flavor-wise, and the icing took around 12 hours to set (commenters on the recipe were complaining about it). I had never tried to pan-bang cookies before so I wanted to do the technique, but I don’t think I will be making these any time soon. 

*Picture 8: Strawberry butter cookies based on ‘Neapolitan Cookies’ from Sally’s Baking Addiction blog (recipe in comments)*

I also wanted to love these but ended up not very happy with them, because of personal preference. I did try to make the Neapolitan cookies on January and managed to make them, even though they were too big and the strawberry dough didn’t stand out a lot in the mix. This time around I just made the strawberry cookie dough (just by tripling what she uses for it) and decorated with white chocolate that I tried to color the white chocolate. Again the flavor of strawberry was simply not there despite using a bit more of strawberry extract than she recommended, and they did not hold their square shape as I wanted them to, but I suspect this is my own fault. I did chill them before baking in the hopes that it will help but it really didn’t. I probably tried to do too many things on this cookie instead of keeping it simple. 

____

All in all it was a fun journey, but I do need practice and organizing myself better next time. It was also a reaffirmation that I do prefer simple and flavorful cookies rather than pretty looking ones and also that for me cookie decorating is nice to see but not as nice to do.

There’s people in here rn that probably wouldn’t have found the person they’re currently with if they didn’t go to a certain party the night that they did, work the job they do at the department they do, take a certain class and ended up sitting next to said girl (or guy), go to the library, coffee shop, bar, grocery store or wherever the hell the day that they ended up going.

My point is all the things I listed are important in increasing your chances, but at the end of the day timing determines whether all that means a damn thing or not. You could do everything allegedly “right” and still fuck up and fail just off of bad timing alone. I don’t think many people realize just how out of your control these things can be, so when a person fails the automatic assumption is that they did something wrong, they were being weird etc, which could very much be the case… or they just couldn’t catch a break. 

The worst part is if you’re luck is really bad in this area nobody really believes you. You could lose for something completely out of your control and still be 100% blamed for it. I’ve never seen this showcased more than in dating discussions. It’s similar to how some people view the poor and financially lower class, many people can’t fathom a reality where someone actually puts in work and still doesn’t succeed, after all they themselves got theirs right? It’s easier to not care when you’ve had in your mind “well they put themselves there”. If it’s lonely at the top it’s fucked up at the bottom.

We've all seen those adrenaline-pumping shark movies with monsters lurking just beneath the surface, but at Stanford, the plot is getting an AI upgrade. Meet the team of student researchers using drones armed with artificial intelligence to track the real stars of the sea—sharks. And no, they don’t need a bigger boat, just better algorithms.

**AI Drones: The Spielberg of Shark Tracking**

Imagine Steven Spielberg with a drone and an AI powerhouse as his director of photography. That’s essentially what these Stanford students are doing with their innovative approach to shark conservation. By filming from above with drones, they capture the aquatic ballet of Pacific Nurse Sharks in stunning detail, using AI to turn footage into actionable insights. Who knew drones could be more than just a sneaky way to check if your neighbors are actually mowing their lawn?

**The Deep Dive into Coding and Conservation**

According to field team member Dakota Riemersma, the genius of this project isn't just the sophisticated drones but the computing magic happening behind the scenes. The AI is both a generalist and a specialist—a versatile nerd one moment, a savant the next. It’s like having both Stephen Hawking and Albert Einstein in your science club, and they actually agree on everything.

**Redefining Recognition with AI**

Now, picture this: an AI with its own version of ""face-to-fin"" recognition, evaluating shark size, motion, and potentially even behavior as they glide through the water. Mark Leone from the team mentions using advanced object detection models, which means they’re not just looking at blobs in the ocean anymore. It’s practically a LinkedIn for marine life, minus the annoying connection requests.

**Streamlining the Science**

Gone are the days of painstakingly analyzing each frame of shark fin footage. Thanks to innovations from Chinmay Lalgudi and others, the data now leaps straight from the sea into the labs without stopping for coffee. This breakthrough promises to reduce human hands-on time dramatically—saving the planet and maybe some grad students’ sanity at the same time.

**Dreaming Big, Dreaming AI**

The goal? To have drones jetting around, capturing and understanding marine life autonomously. Imagine an AI that discovers a new fish species during lunch break. Jaden Clark from the team is optimistic, aiming for a future where AI does the heavy lifting, and we can focus on turning these discoveries into tangible conservation action plans.

**What’s Your Take?**

Are AI innovations like these the future of wildlife conservation, or are they merely shiny distractions from getting boots (or fins) on the ground (or ocean floor)?

AI killed it in 6 minutes. Welcome to the paradoxical world where digital giants are making waves faster than a Pokémon Go flare. If you haven't had coffee yet, beware—this story will both shake and stir.

A new breed of “AI accelerationists” is redefining Silicon Valley's notorious hustle culture. They're not just pushing the boundaries—they're obliterating them. These tech enthusiasts, led by big names like Elon Musk and Marc Andreessen, aren’t just aiming for improvement—they’re racing towards superhuman intelligence. Their motto? Slow and steady loses the race.

You've probably overheard them at conferences, those zealots whose battle cry is ""Damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead!"" For them, AI isn't just a tool—it's the ultimate hustle, enabled by leaps and bounds in technology, seemingly immune to the speed bumps of ethics and regulations. 

Imagine being able to develop tech without worrying about pesky things like, you know, oversight. The Paris AI Summit reflects this mentality, conspicuously lacking in vocabularies like ""risk"" or ""consequence."" Their vision is a world where AI runs free as a Zenon chandelier salesman—flamboyant and unchecked.

Now let’s talk about the ultimate goal: creating AI that’s faster, smarter, and potentially chaotic. How do you tame the beast of your own creation? Or perhaps the question is: should you even bother trying to tame it at all?

So, where does this leave startups? Normal, everyday businesses, trying to make their mark, powerless against the AI behemoth that can pivot, iterate, and implement faster than you can say ""serial entrepreneur."" Is survival in a hyper-accelerated AI world a fool's errand?

It's all happening now. The convergence of technology and the wild ambitions of accelerationists has opened a Pandora's box. Are the rest of us prepared to handle what emerges, or are startups simply collateral damage in this AI arms race?

I usually work in fulfillment so my cup is usually in my cart if it isn't empty yet. Today I literally had probably 3 swallow of my coffee left, and one of the team leads called me and asked me to meet them to go over the plan for the day. When I go to walk off, after our discussion, they tell me they need me to go take my cup and put it in my locker because ""they're cracking down on beverages "" and goes on about ""I know it's great to have some coffee in the morning,  but think about how it looks."" And goes on about how from now on we're only allowed to drink clear liquids throughout our shifts. I find this very odd, especially since we have a keurig in the break room,  a Starbucks that we get employee discounts at, and I have worked here 5 years and have never once been told I can't have a drink at all or that I can only drink clear liquids during my shift? Never been talked to about it or even warned. Also, I usually only have my coffee on the floor maybe 10 minutes and usually before the store even opens. I'm very confused.  Is this normal or a new thing? Has anyone experienced anything like this or been told this? I mostly drink coffee to counteract things like my allergy medication because it makes me a literal robot. Also, I suck at drinking fluids, but feel I do better if I have a drink with me at all times. I'm so upset and confused by this? ",1,1739342941.0,Target,3,1.0,False

It’s not like a TMZ type account, I give  intellectualized thought out takes that take me a long time because I’m usually writing and researching for a few hours. First, I did it because I enjoyed it, but I was super excited when I was able to join the creator rewards program. However, I didn’t realize you make so little money even from videos with hundreds of thousands of views. Maybe that was naïve of me… But I’m realizing the only people who make real money are the lifestyle influencers who can get brand deals. So I have a lot of followers on this account, but should I just give up or should I start over and pivot content on the same account? To be honest, I’m really just not the type of person that I think can succeed as a lifestyle influencer even though I am a young ggen z woman who could otherwise fit that demographic – my life is not aesthetic enough, I don’t care to make it aesthetic enough, I am more passionate about learning, sharing discourse, etc., than showing off outfits and coffee – and therefore that seems to be what I’m good at. that is NOT me bashing on lifestyle influencers – I would love nothing more than to be one and to make money that way, but I just don’t think it’s where my strengths are.

Can I ever really get any type of monetization or opportunities from posting this kind of content? It seems like it might only stand to hurt me. And yes, I am genuinely passionate about it, but I also have a lot of medical bills right now and if I’m gonna be pouring my time into something, it would be really great if it had the potential for growth or opportunity down the road – whether that be a podcast opportunity, any type of money, etc. It just gives me a lot of anxiety that by posting my authentic opinions on really important topics and educating people, I may actually be harming myself because jobs, people, etc. won’t want to interact with me due to my opinions being out there at my digital footprint. And yes, I thought about all this before, but I had a relatively fast exponential growth on the account and I thought I would start making money through the creator rewards per game and it would be worth it.

After studying abroad and learning through my own mistakes, I’ve compiled these game-changing tips to make your experience smoother, more fun, and way more memorable. 🚀

1. **Pack Smart, Pack Light.** We all know the struggle of overpacking (looking at you, 10 pairs of shoes). Here’s the deal: pack versatile clothes, leave room for the souvenirs, and remember that layers are your best friend. Don't forget a **universal plug adapter** — trust me, you’ll thank me later. 😉
2. **Public Transport = Life Saver.** In most countries, public transport is your golden ticket. Skip the pricey taxis and learn the ins and outs of the local transit system. Pro tip: Google Maps and transit apps are your new best friends.
3. **Open a Local Bank Account.** I get it, banking is boring, but setting up a local account will save you from those annoying international transaction fees. It’s especially useful for paying rent or grabbing lunch without that extra charge every time.
4. **Travel Like a Local, Not a Tourist.** Weekends? Don't just stay in your dorm. Hop on a bus or train to explore nearby cities or hidden gems. Whether it’s local weekend trips or short flights, travel like a local. You'll not only discover new places but feel more at home in your new city.
5. **Quality Over Quantity: Don’t Overpack Your Schedule.** There’s no need to do *everything* — trying to squeeze in every event or activity will just leave you burned out. Pick a few things, dive in deep, and enjoy the experience instead of rushing through it. Your mental health will thank you.
6. **Study Smart, Experience More.** Yes, you’re there to study, but you’re also there to live! Tie your coursework to your surroundings. Visit museums, historical sites, and local events that align with your studies. Learning in the real world? It’s a game changer.
7. **Create a Support Network.** Homesickness happens. But finding a support system with fellow study-abroad students can make all the difference. Get involved in clubs, chats, or even just a meetup over coffee. Sharing experiences will help you feel less alone.
8. **Health First.** Don’t wait until you're stuck in bed with a flu to figure out your health coverage. Get solid travel insurance and keep a small emergency kit on you (meds, band-aids, etc.). You’ll feel a lot better knowing you’re prepared!
9. **Food is an Adventure.** You’re in a new country — time to *eat your heart out*! Be brave, try everything, and discover new flavors that might just become your new obsession. **Pro Tip:** Don’t be afraid to ask the locals for restaurant recs. They know the best spots!
10. **Document Every Single Moment.** Trust me, you’ll never regret taking the time to capture your memories. Whether it’s journaling, snapping pics, or vlogging, you’ll look back and feel nostalgic. This journey? It’s once-in-a-lifetime — make sure to keep a record!

1inkwue,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1inkwue/aitah_for_texting_my_friends_in_the_gc_about_how/,AITAH for texting my friends in the gc about how they hurt me during a depressive episode?,"Myself (27F) and 2 closest friends Dee (31F) & Carey (34F) recently had a bestie breakup. A few months ago I had a depressive episode and reached out to my 2 friends in our group chat telling them that I was struggling. My best friend Dee replied in the chat saying ""Sorry to hear that. Can't wait to see you at book club tomorrow!"" And the other sent a bible verse. Both of the responses felt a little insensitive (not the Bible verse, I just didn't resonate because I'm not  religious).

 I was depressed for 2 weeks after I sent the text to our gc (for reasons unrelated). For context, When I'm depressed I tend to isolate myself meaning I take a break from socials and I won't respond to texts/calls. During this time though, I received 2 texts from them total-- no calls or visits otherwise. 1 week into it, Dee sent me a text message about baking, but still no call or checkin. I think that maybe she doesn't do well with negative emotions and this was her way of checking in because we connect as bakers, but it felt a little self-absorbed... Then 1.5 weeks in they both texted me at the exact same time which was weird to me because it seemed like they were talking about me behind my back (Dee has a bad habit of doing this so this felt like a reasonable assumption); If I shared in the gc about struggling, why wouldn't you both just text me in the gc checking in-- at the very least. After 2 weeks passed and I pulled myself out of my depression (without the help of my 2 closest friends), I reached out to Dee separately sharing my dissapointment in how she handled the situation (because her and I are closer than C and I)-- I was expecting at the very least a phone call.A call to checkin on your friend when they're crashing out to me is bare minimum, they also have my location so if it were me I would've just shown up to their house to checkin.  Her response was ""I can't support you unless you tell me how to support you,"" which is understandable but calling your friend in a time of need didn't seem like it needed to be communicated. I then texted the gc sharing the same sentiments in a calm, polite, and respectful manner and they did not respond well to it. In my head it wasn't that big of a deal, just me expressing myself to my friends. Carey said that she doesn't deal with friendships with this much drama (the drama being me expressing myself and my vulnerability ) and essentially cut me off as a friend. Dee simply didn't respond and we haven't spoken since. It's been 3 months and we were friends for almost 2 years. 

I'm very hurt by this because I moved to this city alone and I thought I was starting to build a friend group I could trust and share vulnerable moments with. Carey made me feel bad for expressing myself saying that I should've called them and that this was ""too much drama"" (for context Carey doesn't have any female friends besides Dee and I), but to me it really didn't feel like a big deal to just share a simple sentiment in the gc. I guess in a way I was being avoidant for not telling them in person but at this point I was so hurt by the lack of communication that I didn't even want to invite them out for coffee to talk about it. The situation was sitting on my heart and I genuinely didn't think it would be a big deal to share it in the same place I shared the original text. AITAH for how I handled the situation?

I was still having symptoms at this point. She said the protonix should allow my stomach to heal in 1-2 months but I had been on it for ~6 months at this point. So she switched to protonix 30 minutes before breakfast and 30 minutes before dinner and no pepcid. I've been struggling with the 30 minutes timing because I usually take meds in the morning right before I eat and at night before I go to sleep. I think the idea is to reduce the acodoty in my stomach to let the irritation heal and then get off the meds, but idk if the needs actually work that well. I know I don't want to be on them long term.

I'm trying to add more veggies/fiber into my diet. I've been considering adding in probiotics and maybe some fermented foods. What else can I do to help heal my stomach besides the meds?

CHAPTER THREE 

PREPARATION FOR THE STARS

A crisp dawn light bathed the sprawling construction zone where the interstellar gate rose against the horizon. Months had passed since the first successful low-power test, and the gate's ongoing development had accelerated. Teams of engineers, scientists, and specialized contractors worked in overlapping shifts, each striving to meet the demanding schedule. From a distance, the gate resembled a monumental archway of concentric metal rings, each layered with thick cables and faintly glowing panels that housed exotic new materials.

Alina Mendel walked along a raised walkway overlooking the assembly site. She wore a protective vest and helmet, both emblazoned with the emblem of the Earth Coalition for Interstellar Research and Communication. Although still in her early thirties, the past year had added subtle lines of worry and resolve to her face. She paused at the rail and gazed down, reflecting on how drastically her life had changed since she detected that first alien signal. Back then, she had been an astronomer hopeful for cosmic contact. Now, she was an integral part of perhaps the most significant engineering effort in human history.

At ground level, heavy machinery rumbled, maneuvering large alloy plates that would form the gate's inner layers. Sparks flared in the early morning air as automated welders sealed the seams. Alina could see Marcus Wu conferring with Dr Iyengar near one of the massive support pylons. She descended a metal staircase and approached them, weaving through parked transport trucks and crates labeled with hazard warnings.

Marcus turned as she approached. Alina, good timing, he said, handing her a data tablet. Dr. Iyengar and I were discussing the final calibrations for the power couplings. If all goes well with the plasma reactors, we might be ready for the next major test in a few weeks.

Dr Iyengar, whose expertise in quantum entanglement had proven invaluable, gave a slight nod of agreement. The exotic elements in these gate panels require a delicate balance of temperature and electromagnetic fields. Even a minor fluctuation could disrupt the entire corridor once we bring it to full power. He let out a soft sigh, adjusting his glasses. But if it works, we can travel across hundreds of light years in a moment.

Alina studied the schematic on the tablet. The diagrams displayed color-coded layers of ring segments, each annotated with mathematical notations. She felt a surge of optimism. It looks like we are on track, though I do worry about the corridor's stability. The new data the senders gave us indicated a refined energy flow. We should be safe if we can replicate that flow with minimal error.

Marcus motioned to a towering structure behind them that housed the main power conduits. Early this morning, I ran a simulation, he said. If we ramp up to half power in the next test, we should be able to maintain an open corridor for a few seconds. That might be enough time to send a small probe through, maybe a drone equipped with sensors.

Alina recalled their earlier plan to attempt an unmanned crossing. Analyzing data from a probe on the other side would be the first real sign that Earth could reach those distant coordinates. It was a daunting prospect. She lowered the tablet, scanning the hive of activity around her. Even with so many skilled hands on deck, there was still a pervasive sense of walking a razor-thin line between triumph and disaster.

Before she could respond, the echo of rotor blades signaled the arrival of a helicopter. It hovered above the site and landed on a designated pad near the perimeter fence. From it emerged a small group of international observers and key dignitaries. The Earth Coalition had prioritized maintaining transparency, inviting neutral experts to witness the gate's progress. Alina and Marcus exchanged a glance. Another day, another group to impress, she murmured with a hint of wry humor.

The delegation was led by a tall representative named Tatiana Melendez. She had a background in planetary science and served as a liaison between the Coalition and various research institutes worldwide. Whenever she appeared, someone higher up wanted a detailed status update. Though Alina respected her, it often turned into a time-consuming affair. Still, she plastered on her best welcoming smile and greeted the newcomers, shaking hands amid the steady noise of machinery.

Representative Melendez began with polite small talk. How is the construction, Dr Mendel? Are we still on schedule? Alina nodded, launching into a concise overview of the project milestones. She explained that each ring segment now featured advanced plating derived from the alien schematics, the power infrastructure was nearing completion, and the next full-scale test was tentatively scheduled for three weeks.

Another observer, a compact man with keen eyes, spoke up. Do we have any concerns about security or potential sabotage? The world is watching, and not everyone agrees with building this gate. Alina glanced at Marcus, who nodded for her to proceed. She gave a measured reply. Security is a priority. We have multiple layers of surveillance, and an international task force protects the site. So far, aside from a few minor incidents, we have not encountered any direct threats.

The group spent the next hour touring the site, asking questions of engineers and scientists who paused their tasks to explain everything from superconducting cables to vacuum-sealed coolant systems. Alina could see that many were excited and nervous about presenting their work to these officials. Even a slight misstatement could sow doubt. When the tour ended, Melendez thanked everyone for their diligence.

Later that day, Alina retreated to the operations center, a circular building bristling with communication antennae. Inside, multiple staff monitored real-time data from the gate, the reactors, and the labs. Glass walls lined the perimeter, offering a panoramic view of the construction zone. Alina found an empty seat near a console showing next week's scheduling matrix. She needed to confirm her tasks, but her mind drifted.

She remembered her mother, who lived in a quiet coastal region far from the bustle of the gate site. They spoke every week or so, but each call had grown more personal in recent months. Her mother worried about the dangers of crossing a cosmic threshold. Alina tried to reassure her, though she understood the fear. The unknown was vast, and no one could guarantee that the beings who had sent the signal would welcome humans with open arms.

As she sat there, lost in thought, a gentle knock on the glass wall startled her. Marcus stood outside, waving. She motioned for him to come in. He took a seat beside her, setting his tablet on the console. He said I managed to refine the following test parameters, sounding pleased. If everything goes right, we will energize the corridor to half capacity and attempt to send a small drone through.

Alina raised an eyebrow. That soon? We only just stabilized the ring plating last week. Are you sure we are ready? Marcus nodded, leaning in. I think we can do it. Dr. Iyengar agrees. Our simulations show stable readings up to sixty percent capacity. Of course, we must approach this carefully, but if the corridor remains open for five or ten seconds, that might be enough to send a drone across and bring back data.

She considered this, tapping her fingers on the console. Suppose we do send a drone. We might lose it entirely if the corridor collapses before it returns. Marcus shrugged. That is a risk. However, the data alone would be worth it. Even partial telemetry could teach us a lot about the environment on the other side, especially if it aligns with the star system indicated by the signal.

Alina's eyes flickered with quiet excitement. If this works, it might be the first real taste of traveling beyond our solar system—the first tangible proof we can do it. Marcus set a reassuring hand on her shoulder. Precisely. So, we keep refining and testing, and hopefully, we will have the results we need in a few weeks.

In the following days, the entire site focused on preparing for the subsequent big trial. Alina noticed that a new kind of energy had taken hold among the staff. Engineers double-checked every bolt and panel. Researchers fine-tuned the drone, outfitting it with sensors, cameras, and a short-range communication link. Even though it would only be a brief foray, everyone felt that success would prove humanity had truly set foot on a grander stage.

Alina returned to the Mount Cambria Observatory one afternoon, where it all began. Although the main project had moved to the gate site, the observatory remained an active data analysis hub. She climbed the spiral staircase to the large radio telescope control room, greeted by the soft hum of electronics. The staff there, once small, had grown to include specialists who maintained contact with the alien signal.

Eva Ramirez, the project coordinator who had been Alina's colleague for years, welcomed her with a warm smile. ""It's good to see you in these parts again, Alina. We have new data from the signal."" She led Alina to a console displaying a stream of coded transmissions. The transmissions carried more refined mathematical notations, perhaps providing further hints about the star system where the senders waited.

Alina read through the data and noticed coordinates aligned with the original blueprint but included additional details about local anomalies. She wondered if these might be natural phenomena like cosmic dust clouds or asteroid fields. The thoroughness of the transmissions suggested the senders wanted Earth to arrive safely. It felt increasingly like a teacher guiding an eager student.

Eva looked thoughtful. The more I see these transmissions, the more I believe they come from a large organization, not just a single planet. The messages have a specific bureaucratic structure, if that makes sense. Alina turned that idea over in her mind. You may be right. They might be part of something akin to a federation or council coordinating contact with emerging species.

Eva nodded slowly. Exactly. I keep seeing references that remind me of official statements or directives. She tapped the screen. Here, for instance, is a portion that repeats the phrase multiple delegates expected. The code words are cryptic, but they could imply a group expecting more than one representative from Earth. It is not just a casual meeting. It might be a formal induction process.

That notion sent a thrill through Alina. The idea of an interstellar council welcoming Earth was both exhilarating and daunting. A knot of curiosity and apprehension tightened in her chest. If they were part of a larger alliance, the universe might teem with civilizations, each with its perspective, culture, and technology. What if some were not as friendly as these signal senders

She pulled her gaze from the console and looked at Eva. We have to be prepared for more than just a friendly handshake. The political or cultural complexity could be immense if many species are involved. Eva nodded, crossing her arms. Indeed, I hope we can enter this situation with humility and caution.

After discussing the latest data, Alina bid farewell to the observatory staff and returned to the gate site. The drive was quiet, giving her time to reflect. Green hills rolled by under a bright sky, a serene setting that contrasted with the whirlwind of activity and ambition that consumed her days. She realized how seldom she had paused to savor her surroundings. The world had not stopped turning simply because humans had discovered new horizons.

Upon her arrival, she found that preparations for the half-power test had advanced significantly. As evening settled in, floodlights turned the site into a constant motion. Crews bolted newly fabricated plates into place while overhead cranes lifted heavy components. Alina made her rounds, checking in with various team leaders. Dr Iyengar, perched behind a row of monitors, gave her a thumbs-up when their eyes met.

Inside a secure hangar, technicians assembled the small drone that would soon attempt the first crossing. It was sleek and roughly the size of a large suitcase, fitted with a powerful propulsion system to maneuver in unknown conditions. A communications dish sat atop its frame, designed to send real-time telemetry back through the corridor. If all went well, the drone would make it to the other side, gather data, and return before the corridor destabilized.

That night, Alina tried to calm her buzzing mind as she pored over the final checklists in her temporary on-site quarters. Her window overlooked the silhouette of the gate. She could see the top arcs glinting under the floodlights, forming an open circle against the dark sky. The entire structure exuded a quiet sense of anticipation.

She remembered childhood nights spent with her father, gazing at the stars through a small backyard telescope. Back then, they had spun stories about far-off worlds and the creatures that might live there. She wished he were alive to see this. There was a gentle ache in her chest as she thought of how proud he would have been. In those simple moments, she rediscovered her original sense of wonder.

The following morning, a meeting was held in the principal operations center to finalize the timeline for the test. Secretary General Golubev joined via a live video link and congratulated the team on their progress. She emphasized the importance of communication protocols and urged them to share every bit of data with the global scientific community. Despite the tight-lipped approach from some governments, Golubev believed transparency was crucial if humanity was to unite for the next phase.

During the meeting, a representative from the Earth Security Council voiced concern about the risk of sending a drone unprotected. She suggested equipping the drone with more robust shielding in case the environment on the other side contained hazards. Marcus explained that the corridor might cause minor radiation bursts or gravitational fluctuations. The group debated the merits of adding more protective layers, which could compromise the drone's speed and agility. Ultimately, they decided on a moderate shield upgrade, hoping to balance safety with maneuverability.

Preparations for the test proceeded quickly after that meeting. Crews worked overtime to install the improved shielding on the drone. Meanwhile, Dr. Iyengar's group ran final simulations of the gate's power surges. Alina and Marcus planned a thorough set of diagnostics to run just moments before activation. Outside, the site teemed with anxious excitement. Observers from scientific journals, plus delegations from multiple countries, camped at a safe distance in specially designated viewing areas. Everyone wanted to witness this next bold step.

The day of the half-power test dawned cool and overcast. Alina arrived at the control center at first light. Despite her jacket, she felt the morning chill. Inside, the atmosphere crackled with anticipation. Rows of monitoring stations lit up with data feeds. A large display at the front of the room showed the gates' status in real time. People spoke in hushed tones as though they were preparing for a launch to the moon, only this launch promised a far stranger destination.

Marcus handed Alina a cup of black coffee. It's a big day, he said, a hint of adrenaline in his smile. She took a sip, her stomach a knot of nerves. Ready as well as ever to be. The next hour was a blur of final checks. Engineers verified that the gate's superconductors were stable. Security teams confirmed that the perimeter was sealed. The drone was loaded onto a mobile platform, which rolled it into position at the center of the gate.

Finally, Secretary-General Golubev, who was present at the site, stepped up to a microphone before a small gathering of reporters and dignitaries. Her voice, steady and calm, was broadcast around the world. Today, we proceed with one of humankind's most significant experiments. We will activate the interstellar gate at half power, attempting to open a corridor through spacetime. A drone will cross to the other side, where we believe the star system indicated by our new allies awaits. This step is an act of hope, and I ask all citizens of Earth to stand united as we push the boundaries of our knowledge.

Applause rippled through the crowd. Alina and Marcus exchanged a look, then moved to their consoles. They had rehearsed this sequence multiple times. Dr Iyengar, stationed at a command station nearby, began a measured countdown. Technicians read off data points: ring alignment is stable, power feed is stable, and the coolant temperature is nominal. Alina felt sweat bead on her brow.

When Dr. Iyengar's voice reached zero, the power flow to the ring surged. Alina saw the gate arcs light up in a dazzling pattern through the control center window. A luminous ripple spread across the circular opening, like liquid glass shimmering under a bright sun. Monitors beeped in rapid succession as data scrolled. The corridor was forming.

Operators triggered the drone's autonomous system. On camera feeds, Alina watched it hover in the center of the ring, engines humming. Without a moment to lose, they directed it forward. The drone advanced through the glowing threshold. For an instant, it was bathed in flickering light; then it vanished into the shimmering plane. The entire control center held its breath.

Data streams burst onto the monitors, displaying chaotic readings from the corridor environment—spikes in electromagnetic fields. Temperature gradients shift unpredictably. Alina locked her gaze on a live telemetry feed from the drone. For a second, the signal flickered, then an image stabilized. It showed a star-dappled blackness as the drone emerged into open space. A hush fell over the room.

They could see faint outlines of celestial objects. The drone pinged back coordinates, which the system cross-checked against the predicted star map. It matched almost perfectly. Several hundred light years from Earth, they were now collecting data. The mood in the control center soared, tears filling more than one pair of eyes. Dr Iyengar let out a disbelieving laugh. It worked. It worked.

But there was no time to celebrate yet. The corridor flickered, and warnings blared on the monitors. The power load was straining the gates systems. We have maybe ten more seconds of stability, someone shouted. Alina quickly punched in the command for the drone to return, her heart pounding. The drone turned, heading back through the shifting portal.

At that moment, a burst of static engulfed the screens. For two heart-stopping seconds, Alina thought they had lost the drone. Then, a flash of light crackled across the corridor, and the drone's camera feed showed the interior of the gate site again. The drone emerged, battered but intact, before the portal collapsed in a swirl of flickering energy.

The control center erupted in cheers. People jumped from their seats, hugging one another. Alina could hardly breathe from the rush of relief. She turned to Marcus, who pulled her into an exuberant embrace. Tears threatened to spill from her eyes. They had done it. Humanity had sent an object hundreds of light years away and back again, even if only for a few seconds.

In the aftermath, while technicians rushed to gather every scrap of data, Alina examined the drone's sensor logs. Her pulse raced as she saw the final reading. The star field recorded by the drone indicated they had emerged in a sector matching the signal coordinates. Further analysis would confirm it, but the initial readouts were promising. They had truly bridged an incomprehensible distance.

Secretary General Golubev addressed the press soon after, declaring the test victorious. She spoke of unity, hope, and the new frontier before humanity. Across the planet, people watched in awe. The images of the drone returning from the corridor spread like wildfire across news channels and social media, igniting a renewed wave of public interest and debate.

That evening, when the frenzy had quieted, Alina finally had a moment to breathe. She stood alone near the now-dormant gate, the metal scaffolding gleaming under bright spotlights. It felt almost alive, like a door that yearned to open again. The test was a giant leap, but the real journey lay ahead. Soon, they would fine-tune the gate to remain stable for longer. Soon, they would consider sending humans.

As she gazed at the silent structure, she felt an ache of eagerness and apprehension. Whoever had sent that invitation would be waiting. In her mind, she pictured them receiving the news that the humans of Earth had taken their first step. A swirl of questions clouded her thoughts. Would the senders come to greet them, or would humans travel there first? Could Earth negotiate a peaceful entry into a community of alien civilizations, Or would they stumble unthinkingly into a galaxy of unknown dangers

She closed her eyes against the glowing lights, listening to the distant hum of machinery as the site powered down for the night. The future was no longer a distant speculation. It was real and unfolding. Humanity had built the beginnings of a gateway to the stars, and there would be no going back.",1,1739342258.0,story,0,1.0,False
1inkvd2,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1inkvd2/im_sorry_for_acting_crazy/,I'm sorry for acting crazy,"I messaged you for 4 months, repeatedly. Pleading, begging, and hoping you'd come back in my life.  I tried to let you go repeatedly but I couldn't.  I tried to not think of you, of us but I couldn't. The very thought of us not being together terrified me, scared me. You blocked me and yet I found ways to contact you. I couldn't stop. I don't know why I couldn't stop. You told me to leave you alone, you told me you want me out of your life, but I couldn't stop trying to convince you to give us another chance. 

If I could have just, just given you space and been in less panic than before. If I could have just, controlled myself a bit more, then maybe you'd have come back. I absolutely ruined any chance we had of being together again. My anxiety ruined everything. 

I was being selfish in those messages, I didn't think of how they would have affected you. I was so blind. I just wanted us back, I believed you'd love me and just wanted us back. I hope you still think of me. I hope you don't hate me. 

But now I realise that I was being selfish. I should have thought of your mental well-being, your new job and how all these constant messages must be affecting you. I'm sorry, I was just blinded by that fear of losing you, it's not an excuse I just truly regret it. I should have respected your boundaries. 

But now, now it's never too late. I'll leave you alone, I'll leave you be. I'll respect you now because I care about you. 

It's probably too late for us, and honestly, you deserve better than someone who was immature and couldn't respect your boundaries. 

But still...I'll wait. Patiently, from afar, I'll wait and hope. Hope that somewhere deep down you still care about me enough to at least reach out and talk to me. Maybe...one day we can be friends and laugh about this in a coffee shop somewhere and joke about how dramatic I was. 

If you're reading this, I truly am sorry to have not respected your boundaries. I wish you the best ahead in life.

1inkt7w,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1inkt7w/aita_for_ruining_my_friends_wedding_trip/,AITA for ruining my friend's wedding trip?,"Well… this is going to be a loooooong one. Please keep in mind that this is just my perspective, but after almost two years, it's been eating me up. (I'll add a TL;DR at the end.)



Before I start, Charlotte, I really love your videos. You, along with my amazing therapist and a podcast with three super awesome cis straight guys (but mostly you and my therapist), have worked a miracle in teaching me how to express my feelings and set boundaries. I honestly can't thank you enough for everything you've done for my mental health. Seriously, thank you so much.



Now, for some context, I live in Mexico. I met this girl, let's call her Maggie, back in kindergarten. We played together for a day but didn’t meet again until mid-elementary school. I don’t really remember how I became part of her friend group, but we were all besties up until university… when I had a fallout with another girl in the group. Since she’s important to the story, let’s call her Elsie.



When we got to middle school, Elsie had to leave our school, and that’s when she and I became besties. The other girls who stayed for middle school and I grew closer than ever. I had very low self-esteem and was so desperate for friends that I never set any boundaries. Looking back, they actually became my biggest bullies. They used my traumas against me, pretended to greet me by name just to walk over to meet the trash can, and once told everyone I was naked when I hid behind a curtain. (They had taken my sweater, and I was wearing a strapped blouse, but I was too shy because of my big chest, so, of course, all the boys ran over to ""take a peek."", I couldn't step out until one of the girls who mistrated me the most went to help me because my friends wouldn't.)



I know they probably didn’t realize that what they were doing would traumatize me, but now, I can’t buy clothes without thinking, ""Will they judge me if I wear this when we go out?"". I got a lot of self-image issues, along with tons of insecurities rooted from many of those ""jokes"".



Sorry for the deviation. Now back to the story.



Years later, I was about to study abroad for 18 months, and we had a sleepover. In the morning, Elsie accidentally took my phone charger and left hers behind, (this was a long time ago she had an iPhone 4, and I had an iPhone 5, so the chargers were different). She had a day-long appointment downtown, and I offered to meet her there so we could switch them. After much insistence, she finally told me she wouldn't have a chance to step out, so she’d bring it to my house when she was done.



It is important to mention that getting my charger back was a big deal. My long-distance boyfriend was coming to town the next day, and he didn’t know anything about my city. Since I had met him online, I was cautious and never told him my address, so I needed to be able to contact him or he'd end up stranded at the airport. Also, he didn't had much money, so he'd be staying at my guest room during his stay because he couldn't save enough for a hotel.



Elsie’s appointment finished around 8 p.m., and she called to say she had a headache and wouldn’t be able to bring my charger. My mom offered to drive me to wherever she was so we could switch them, but Elsie said she was already heading home and might be able to meet me in three days, which was after my boyfriend's flight home was scheduled.



We argued, and after getting nowhere, I snapped and told her ""You can keep it, throw it away, gift it, sell it, whatever. I'll just buy a new one in the morning"". I figured that if we both cooled down, we could talk it out later, so I planned on reaching out after my boyfriend left.



That night, she came to my house, threw my charger at me, and returned the gift I had given her to remember me while I was gone, accusing me of treating her like a maid.



The next morning, another girl from our group called me and asked to meet up. I told her I was busy because I had to pick up my boyfriend from the airport in a few hours and still needed to finish cleaning my house, but she insisted. I finally agreed, but it had to be quick.



They basically tried to act out their own episode of ""The Jerry Springer Show"". Elsie was there and told her version of the story. I let her talk, but when it was my turn, she kept interrupting. By the time I could leave, it was too late to pick up my boyfriend, so I had to ask him to take a taxi to a mall near my house so he wouldn’t have to wait an extra hour at the airport since it was a long drive.



After that, my frienship with Elsie was no more and I left the country for my scholarship abroad. During that time, the rest of the group kept seeing Elsie, which of course made sense because in their eyes, she had done nothing to them, her beef was with me.



You might have forgotten by now, but this is about Maggie, not Elsie. However, this context is important because Elsie and Maggie became best friends after this, and still are.



When I came back to Mexico, I tried to avoid any reunion where Elsie would be, but that meant I was being excluded from most events in our friend group. The only exceptions were birthdays, where for a whole year, they held two separate dinners because of the situation.



The following year, Maggie told me that for her birthday, she wanted both Elsie and me to be there. I told her, I will be there for you. Who you invite is up to you. You are my friend, and I will do my best to make sure you have the best birthday. This went on for years without issues.



Eventually, Maggie met the love of her life, and he was wonderful. I had never seen her so happy. I always told her things like, ""You two are my favorite ship"", or ""You’re the best couple ever."". Finally, they got engaged, and then suddenly, Maggie and Elsie had a big fallout.



I tried my best never to say a bad word about Elsie because I knew Maggie was really upset about the situation. Instead, I gave her advice on how to fix their friendship, but Elsie wouldn’t give her an inch. So Maggie started reaching out to me. We went out for coffee often, and she called me whenever she had trouble with her partner, to which I tried my best to give her advice that would prioritize her happiness while avoiding conflicto as much as possible.



Her court wedding was in November, and by the end of August, Elsie and Maggie reconciled. At her court wedding, after arriving almost two hours late, Elsie and another girl from the group were her witnesses. I felt betrayed, but she was overjoyed that day, so I knew better than to say anything, or even show my disappointment.



Maggie had always dreamed of a church wedding at the beach, so she planned it for May, two years after the court wedding. A few months after the civil ceremony, she told me that the two girls who had been her witnesses had just confirmed they wouldn’t be attending the beach wedding in Cancún. She was devastated, especially since they were two of her closest friends.



At the time, I was going through a very difficult financial situation, but I managed to save enough to attend along with my mother, but from our childhood friend group, my mom was the only mother attending. In the months leading up to the wedding, my mental health declined for reasons unrelated to Maggie. By then, I still hadn’t realized that the people I considered my true friends had never really had my back. When I finally opened up to them about my dark thoughts, I hoped they might offer some suppert, or idk.. something? Instead, they simply said, ""You should’ve told us"", and then brushed it off as if I just told them I had put too much sugar on my coffee. I felt ignored, but maybe I was expecting too much? I'm not really sure, I would really appreciate if someone told me what a normal reaction to that would be. Anyways, at that moment I started questioning myself. Maybe I was overreacting, or being too much. With Maggie’s wedding coming up, I convinced myself not to think much of it and that they probably had more important things on their mind.



A few months after that conversation, Elsie and the other girls suddenly announced they would be attending the wedding after all, though they planned to stay at a different hotel. When the guaranteed room rate was about to expire, they finally decided to stay at the wedding hotel. Maggie was super excited, and I was happy for her. She was living her fairy tale, and I didn't want to ruin it with my petty feelings. 



Several mental breakdowns later (which I totally kept from Maggie), and with the help of my therapist, I was finally feeling better and actually excited for Maggie’s wedding trip in Cancún. The day we arrived, I got there about an hour after everyone else because I flew with a different airline (I ad to since my flight was way cheaper and I couldn't afford the one they all came together in).



We accidentally ran into each other at the lobby, and right after I finished greeting everyone, Elsie looked me up and down and loudly asked ""What happened to you? You weren’t like this last time we all had dinner!"". Since I had been on a no-carb diet for a couple of weeks, and also doing regular diet for months beore the wedding, I naively assumed she meant I looked better. So I just smiled and said, ""Well, the diet worked"", but now I assumed it was not as nice of a comment as I believed.



The first night... yeah, I’m gonna be honest, I had way too much to drink. Maggie had told me that one of her future husband's friends had a thing for me, so I thought it was about time for me to try and get out from being single. But, being the absolute mess that I am, I somehow managed to tell literally everyone except him that I was interested (including this random older guy who, to my surprise turned out to be his uncle). So, as expected, I made a total fool of myself, and now things were all kinds of awkward between me and this guy. 



Before the trip, I had already told Maggie that since my mom was the only one of our moms who came along, I didn’t want to leave her alone all day. So my plan was to hang out with my mom during the day and then meet up with everyone at night. This also was as an excuse for my socially anxious self to create some distance and hopefully make things a little less cringe for everyone.



On the wedding day, Elsie came up to me and was like, ""Today’s Maggie’s special day, so please don’t drink."" I was already annoyed because she had been rude to my mom just a few minutes earlier, so I just said, ""My drinking is none of your business, so whether I do or don’t, don’t worry, I won’t make it your problem."" Maybe it wasn't the nicest thing to say, but something in her tone really pissed me off.



During the party, I was feeling awkward, specially because of my first night's performance, so I was sitting until one of the girls I met there invited me to the dance floor. Once I felt a bit more confident, I tried interacting with Maggie, but she didn't looked my way. The rest of the night went without incidents. The only relevant things that night were 2.



1. At some point, I went back to my room to change to a beach dress, since the one I was wearing was too warm for the weather, even at night.



2.The groom later told me that apparently I had pushed him, kind of looking for a fight. He mentioned the conversation that we had (within a group) during the first night, but I didnt black out and remember everything clearly.We were talking about the difference in strength between men and women, and I've always been proud about my physical strength, so I said something like ""if we fought, you wouldn't go unharmed"". I tried to be playful but somehow he remembers it in a different setting with his parents there and in his memory I pushed him, even though I remember clearly and I don't remember doing such a thing. It seems so unreal because it is very out of character for me. Even drunk, I am not an aggressive person, the only time I went physical with someone was on 3rd grade when they were bullying my best friend, so I still find it hard to believe I did that. Still, when he told me so I simply answered ""being drunk, or not remembering are not excuses, I truly apologize for that. I am so sorry, I really can't believe I did that. I hope you and Maggie can forgive me for being so rude.""



Besides that conversation, the wedding went on without issues.



On the last night, we hit up one of the hotel bars, but honestly, I was vibing more with the groom’s sister than with my actual friends at that point. I tried dancing with them, but they either ignored me or ditched me after a few minutes. I figured maybe I was just being sensitive, so I kept dancing. At one point, Maggie and another friend went to get drinks, leaving me alone with Elsie. When they came back, they sat down, but still left me standing there with Elsie. I finally sat down too, hoping to spend some time with Maggie, but she was deep in conversation with the other girl, and between the music and my bad hearing, I had no clue what they were saying. So I just pulled out my phone. After a while, we started dancing again, and surprise, surprise—when I looked around, I was once again left alone with Elsie, Maggie’s SIL, and her cousins. Eventually, SIL and the cousins called it a night and left. I was so over being left with Elsie, on top of that my stomach was still mad at me from night one (yeah, it was that bad). So when SIL suddenly came back in because she forgot her purse, I took the chance and went back with her and her cousins. For context, to get from where we were to my room, I had to take a bus, and if I missed it, I had no clue when the next one would come. I was feeling sick, the club wasn't much of our vibe, and I didn't felt like being left alone with Elsie again, so I went to find Maggie, and said Good night before leaving.



Fat forwar a couple of weeks,we were back to our city, and Maggie called me because some equipments I ha rented her for her coffee shop were failing. I brought the tchnician over and she too the chance to confront me, saying I kept ""running away"" from her. I asked her to explain because I was confused on what she meant, and she said that not spending the afternoons with her and her friend group, and leaving the bar on the last night seemed like I was running away from ""something"". I tried to explain to her that it was not my intention to run away, and I was sorry if it seemed that way, but she didn't seem satisfied. She also told me ""Why would you apologize to my husband and not to me"", which made me even more confused. I simply apologized again, not knowing what else to say. Next time she contacted me, she had closed her coffee shop and wanter to return the equipments I had rented out to her. She tried negociating one of the equipments, but she wanted it for basically half the agreed price. I apologized that I couldn't do that, and we haven't talked since.



At the time, I felt like she purposefully ignored me the whole trip and if she wanted me to be part of something, she should've said so and I would've done so. But after seeing several of your videos, I'm starting to think that maybe I was too focused on my own issues, Elsie, and how her mistreating of me was being ignored. So, when Maggie confronted me, I felt like I was being stabbed in the back.



It was her day, her trip, and I can't shake this feeling that I did it about me. Now we don't speak anymore, and I feel like maybe I could've been more accomodating, that maybe I could've left my mom by herself to be with Maggie, even if it made me uncomfortable to be with Elsie and the guy I failed to flirt with. I feel like despite all the history, I could've been a better friend, and that my mental issues or my beef with Elsie shouldn't have affected my judgment or behavior. I know that if it happened to someone else I would totally tell them that they did their best with the information they had, but I can't helo but feel like I fucked up.



Please everyone, specially Charlotte, our dear Potato Queen, tell me, was I the Asshole?



**TLDR.** I got drunk on the first night of my friend's wedding trip, and made a fool of myself. Because of that and other issues, I only met the couple and the rest of the guests during the nights. My friend felt like I was avoiding her, and now we don't talk anymore. ",2,1739342016.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

Today, I told her I was planning to send her flowers for Valentine’s Day at work. She responded by saying no, that it would be weird because “nobody gets flowers at work for Valentine’s Day.” She also asked if I was doing it to “mark my territory” and said she didn’t want that.

To which she expressed her discomfort and said she didn’t want to stay on FaceTime anymore, so we decided to hang up, and we haven’t texted each other since, though it hasn’t been long.

I found this really odd because when I sent her flowers for her birthday, she didn’t say she didn’t want them or that having them at work was an issue. Is this a red flag?
