I am a 23 year old, 176 cm high white female with a personal background only of mental health diagnoses.


One month ago I came to visit my mom and weighted, I was 67.7 kg then and felt quite good physically, but was still affected by chronic stress/anxiety and depression somewhat. 

My appetite is, I would say, normal, then even worse than now.

I eat healthy food 3 times a day, often drink up to 5 cans of beer at night, and every 3-4 days I eat extremely calorie heavy fast food (my typical Mcdonald‚Äôs order is a Big Mac, Large fries, 9 piece nuggets and two sauces). 

This is the diet that I‚Äôve been following for half a year now, I didn‚Äôt ever gain weight rapidly in my life (despite when going trough puberty), it was always a slow gain up to 2-3 kg a month. 

This day I weighted again, now weighing 58.0kg despite being 59.1kg 2-3 days ago. 

I did not change my diet, I still drink beer and eat sweets, sugar and bread. 

My family has a history of Uterine problems, my great grandma died because of it, my grandma is perfectly fine in that regard, my mom had a benign tumor and had her uterus removed, she never lost weight that rapidly (at least without the help of Ozempic which she used without prescription to lose weight, I don‚Äôt use something like that).
Our family does not have known Gastrointestinal Cancer history. 
I do not have any other info about my great grandma despite her diagnosis. 

I‚Äôm on medications such as Venlafaxine (75 mg for 3 months every day, almost completely tapered down in 2 months. Didn‚Äôt use it right anyways, missed doses and got off of it because I hated it, and I‚Äôm Bipolar, we tend to ditch drugs). I‚Äôve taken Venlafaxine before and never had weight fluctuations on it; Guanfacine - 1mg for one week for now (for ADHD, stimulant use is illegal where I live), and Lamotrigine - 25mg (for 3 weeks, Lamotrigine doesn‚Äôt really affect weight according to studies, as I‚Äôve read).

Also I take Choline - ~300mg, Multivitamins, B6 and Magnesium, fish oil, all not that regularly as I would‚Äôve wanted too, but more often than not, so almost every day. 

I don‚Äôt use drugs except for Marijuana and Alcohol, no stimulants except for two cups of coffee with sugar and milk per day.

I am not depressed right now or generally bummed, I feel real nice actually, although I experience stress right now because of family issues, I‚Äôm really mindful and I know which tools usually help me deal with stress, so I‚Äôm mostly calm and relaxed when I‚Äôm alone. 

The other month I had a problem when I could sleep up to 20 hours a day, or I could have a streak of sleeping up to >30 hours in two days. I would still feel very tired and weak physically when awake, so generally I would go back to sleep, I have attributed that to depression and even consider being hypersomniac, I have doubts about that now. 

Since last month or 3 weeks I‚Äôve been trying to fix my sleep schedule, now sleeping no more than 9 hours from ~12pm - ~9am, occasionally having 45 min - 3 hour naps midday, still feeling weak, just sleeping less and having less grogginess. I do have a brain fog and memory issues but I tent do attribute that to depression, right now I‚Äôm not depressed.

The other weird symptom that I have is feeling extremely hot even slightly active even being warm, up to beads of sweat falling from my forehead, upper body and arms, not armpits because I had Botox injections for supposed Hyperhidrosis. 
Yesterday I was forced to walk only in a T-shirt and unzipped hoodie in 12 degrees by Celsius because I was dripping. 
I‚Äôm generally quite cold when at home, despite everyone else feeling okay with the room temperature, ~21-26 Celclius. 

I don‚Äôt look physically ill right now, though my dear grandma commented on the hollowing of my cheeks, I‚Äôve noticed it too.
I have some visible fat on my abdomen, arms and thighs, I don‚Äôt look sickly thin as of now. 

I don‚Äôt have recurring headaches, sharp abdominal pain, maybe some slight digestive issues, but generally they resolve by themselves within couple of days. 
I still feel weak physically, although I can walk up to 10000 steps if I force myself, but I will be sore and tired for a couple of days. In days when I‚Äôm active I often need to sit down to collect myself, I can‚Äôt stand for longer than ~25 minutes without feeling weak. 

I understand that I might‚Äôve slightly mess up the timeline, but I‚Äôm certain that it was still under 3 months. 
There might be days when I eat l, but I get extremely weak fast and eat anyways. 
There are days when I feel nauseous, have weak appetite, usually I will still force myself to eat. 

Would like to get some advice on to which specialist I can refer to and for which tests to ask for, thank you guys in advance ü•≤üíó

Ren's breathing came in ragged bursts.

The music had stopped, but its echo still howled in his mind. The silence was worse‚Äî empty, suffocating. Like the world had forgotten to exhale. His chest rose and fell in jerks, sweat clinging to his skin. The mechanical arms kept him locked in place, indifferent to the trauma pulsing through his veins.

He felt like a corpse being kept alive by wires.

Symphony stood upright, stepping back with effortless poise. Her silver-dyed locs fell over one shoulder in a slow, controlled sway. Her fingers no longer danced on the armonia; it hung silent at her side, the weapon sheathed in stillness. She cast a brief glance at Andre, one brow raised.

""I'm done,"" she said flatly, with her usual cool, unimpressed edge. ""If you want more, you can serenade yourself‚ÄîI'm getting coffee. Bye."" With a flick of her locs and a barelythere smirk, she turned on her heel and strode out, heels tapping like punctuation marks as the door swung shut behind her.

The man leaning against the wall let out a low chuckle, his grin wide and knowing. He nodded slowly, eyes hidden behind mirrored shades, yet the tilt of his head made his expression unmistakable.

""Well, hell,"" he drawled, dragging the words out like smoke. ""So the kid's an Essence user too. That explains the glowy hands and the kaiju barbecue.""

He stepped closer to Ren, hands resting on his belt, the trinkets at his hips clinking with each step. ""Didn't know what to make of you at first‚Äîjust another half-dead brat with a chip on his shoulder. But now? Now we're gettin' somewhere.""

Ren stared at him, eyes wide, jaw clenched. His body trembled with adrenaline and fury.

""You‚Äî"" he hissed, voice cracking. ""You watched all of that‚Ä¶? Everything? You saw it all?""

the man didn't even flinch. ""Every damn second.""

Ren snapped. His voice cracked like glass. ""That was‚Äîmine! My life, my memories‚Äî what gave you the right to just rip that out of me?!""

He thrashed against the restraints, metal groaning in protest. ""Why the hell did you do that?!""

Symphony said nothing. She simply looked away, eyes hooded.

The man didn't blink. Didn't apologize.

""We needed to know,"" he said flatly.

That was it. No remorse. No sugarcoating. Just raw necessity.

Ren recoiled like he'd been slapped. ""Fuck you""

The silence between them crackled like a storm ready to break.

The man didn't flinch. Didn't raise his voice. But the shift was instant‚Äîlike a predator remembering its teeth.

His grin vanished. His body straightened. A low, simmering gravity settled around him.

""You forget where you are, kid?"" he said, voice hard now, stripped of charm. ""You ain't in your bed at home cryin' over a bad dream. You're strapped to a table in the underbelly of a city that don't give two shits if you live or bleed out. You're here 'cause¬†we¬†pulled you outta that battlefield when your lungs were barely workin'. You're breathin' right now‚Äî¬†healed‚Äîbecause we chose to fix what was left of you.""

He leaned closer, and Ren could see the lines in his face now‚Äîetched by fire and years. ""So maybe‚Äîyou oughta show a lil' gratitude before you go cursin' out the folks keepin' you alive.""

Ren's throat tightened, but he said nothing.

Then, as fast as it came, the storm eased. The man's voice lowered again‚Äîgravelly but no longer sharp.

""Look,"" he said, backing off a step, eyes unreadable behind those shades. ""Ain't sayin' what we did was pretty. But I saw what happened to you. And I ain't here to judge.""

He folded his arms across his broad chest, tone shifting to something almost gentle, before continuing. ""Look, I ain't gonna lie or sugarcoat it. You went through hell. You're still in it. But I ain't here to hurt you‚ÄîI'm here to offer a way out."" Ren said nothing, but his jaw clenched.

Andre continued. ""What's in you‚Äîthat power‚Äîit's called Essence.¬†Every living thing's got it. Trees, bugs, dogs, people. But some of us? We're wired different. We got more. We can use it. That makes us Essence Users.""

He tapped his chest. ""Like me. Like her."" He jerked his thumb toward Symphony, who stood silently, arms folded, eyes unreadable. ""And now, like you."" Ren blinked, the words not quite settling in. Not yet.

""You don't know how to control it, which means you've been leakin'¬†Essence like an open wound,"" Andre said, standing tall again. ""Monsters follow that trail like blood in the ocean. That's why it found you. That's why people around you‚Äî"" He paused, then shook his head. ""‚Äîgot hurt.""

Ren's heart sank like a stone dropped into black water. He didn't need to be told what ""people"" meant.

The man's voice dropped lower, no longer just persuasive‚Äîcommanding.

""So here's the choice kid. You walk outta here and keep pretendin' this'll all go away. But you'll keep leakin' your essence. And more people'll die."" A beat.

""Or‚Ä¶ you stay. We train you. Teach you how to use what you've got. So the next time a monster comes callin', it's you who hunts them.""His gaze hardened.""In return, you help kill monsters from time to time.""

Ren closed his eyes.

""They already saw everything.""

His voice cracked.¬†""These people‚Ä¶ they just reached into my head like it was nothing. Like my life was some movie they could pause.""

His breath caught.The metal arms still pinned him down like an animal on a dissection table‚Äîcold and unrelenting.

""I should hate them. I do hate them. I'm furious. No one has the right to do what they did.""

His fists clenched, still bound, still trembling.""But‚Ä¶ they're right. Even if I don't understand everything.""

Behind his closed eyes, memories flickered‚ÄîHis father's hand reaching for him.His mother's scream.The crack of bones.The drip of blood across the hardwood floor.

Kaito's broken, hollow stare‚Äîthe last time their eyes had met before everything twisted into madness.

""He needed help. I walked away.""

The monster's voice rang out again in his mind, warped and burning with rage‚Äî""You watched. You did nothing.""

Ren gritted his teeth. His chest burned, the guilt coiled tight and sharp inside him.

""I killed Kaito. I lost them all. And I just stood there.""

He didn't want to be that person anymore. Couldn't.

""No one else dies because of me. Not again.""

He swallowed hard. The fire in his chest cooled, hardening into something quieter.Something resolved.

""‚Ä¶Fine.""

The man smiled again. That slow, sure smile of someone who'd already seen the end of the story‚Äîand knew exactly when the hero would break.

""Good answer, kid.""

Without breaking eye contact, he raised two fingers and snapped them in a smooth flick. Instantly, the metallic clank of gears echoed through the room. The mechanical arms that had kept Ren locked down hissed and released their grip, slinking back into their housings like spiders retreating into the walls.

Ren gasped, his muscles sagging with sudden freedom.

""Alright, kid,"" the man said, stepping back and jerking his thumb toward a small metal table cluttered with medical junk. ""Now do me a favor‚Äîput on some damn pants.""

He grabbed a folded pair of black cargo pants from the mess and tossed them in Ren's direction. They slapped wetly against Ren's chest and flopped into his lap.

Ren blinked, staring down at them‚Ä¶ and then froze. His eyes went wide as full realization hit like a hammer.

""Wait‚Ä¶""

He looked down at himself‚Äîreally looked.

""W-WHAT THE HELL?!"" Ren scrambled backward, clutching the pants against his bare chest as his face burned hotter than a reactor core. ""I've been NAKED this whole time?!""

Symphony, still leaning coolly against the far wall, arched a single brow, eyes glinting with lazy amusement but saying nothing.

The man‚Äîunapologetic‚Äîjust chuckled. ""Hell, kid, you think we heal ya through your clothes?¬†You damn near died, remember? You should be thankin' me you ain't still hooked up to the machines.""

Ren's jaw worked uselessly, eyes darting around for anything to cover up with. He scrambled to yank the pants on as fast as humanly possible, twisting awkwardly on the floor, muttering curses under his breath.

""Oh my god,"" Ren groaned, still fumbling with the waistband, ""could you guys have said something sooner?!""

""Where's the fun in that?"" the man replied, smirking. ""A little humility's good for the soul.""

Finally, Ren managed to get the pants on‚Äîstill red-faced, still glaring. He crossed his arms over his chest, now extremely aware of how cold the room was.

The man stepped forward, extending a large, calloused hand.

""Name's Andre,"" he said simply, the grin dropping into something solid and genuine for the first time. ""Welcome to the crew.""

Ren hesitated a beat‚Äîthen exhaled hard and shook his hand. ""Ren.""

Andre's grip was firm, warm, and final.

Andre smirked. ""Yeah, yeah. I know, kid. Been sayin' it all night."" Andre clapped him on the back hard enough to make him stumble. ""Alright, enough mopin'. You're one of us now, so time to show ya around.""

""So here's the thing,"" Andre began, waving a hand casually like he was explaining the weather, ""you ever look up at the stars and think, 'Damn, I bet there's some wild shit out there?'""

Ren blinked, frowning. ""Uh‚Ä¶ yeah? Sure. Aliens and stuff?""

Andre laughed. ""Aliens and stuff.¬†Kid, you don't know the half of it.""

He shoved open a heavy sliding door, motioning Ren to follow. ""We ain't just some ragtag group of monster hunters from around the block. Nah. The rest of the crew‚Äîwe ain't even from Earth.""

Ren stumbled. ""Wait, what?""

Andre grinned wider, clearly enjoying himself now. ""Yeah, kid. Outer damn space. Whole other planets, galaxies you ain't even seen on your little science fair posters. We're what you'd call‚Ä¶ extraterrestrial.""

Ren stopped dead in his tracks. ""Hold up, hold up, hold up‚Äîyou're all aliens?!""

Andre grinned, clearly enjoyin' Ren's reaction. ""If that's what you Earth folks like to call us, sure. Different worlds, different systems, all workin' together for a greater purpose."" He chuckled, shaking his head. ""But yeah, technically. We work for POND‚Äîstands for

Planetary Operations for Neutralizing Dangers. Fancy-ass name for what we do: keep Essence users in check and clean up messes before they swallow whole planets.""

Ren's jaw practically hit the floor. ""You're telling me there's, like, a space government that polices magic people?!""

Andre let out a whoop of laughter. ""Calm down, kid. Ain't nobody really comin' out here, alright? Matter of fact, this the first time outer space even bothered with your planet. Earth and the Milky Way? Well‚Ä¶ they ain't exactly remarkable. No offense.""

Ren frowned. ""Then why are you all here now?""

Andre's grin faded just a touch. ""HQ picked up a spike. Some kinda anomaly in Earth's essence. Way too big to ignore. So they sent folks like me to figure out what the hell's goin' on.""

Ren ran a hand through his hair. ""So Earth went from 'meh' to 'possible magical biohazard zone' overnight. Great.""

Andre barked another laugh. ""You'll get used to it, kid. Or you'll die tryin'. Either way‚Äî hell of a ride.""

They rounded a corner, and Andre thumped his hand on a wide metal door. ""Alright. Enough talk. Time to meet the rest of the weirdos.""

I woke up before my alarm. 6:14 a.m.

For the first time in years, I beat it. The room was still dim, the soft hum of my ceiling fan filling the silence. I lay there for a while, staring at the same water stain on the ceiling I‚Äôd always ignored. It looked different now, the shape had shifted slightly. Less like a blob, more like‚Ä¶ an eye.

I shook the thought away, turning on my side. Get up. It‚Äôs just water damage. Don‚Äôt start your day weird. I showered, dressed, and went to grab my pants, the same pair I‚Äôd worn yesterday. The stitching on the seam was gone. Not torn again, not frayed. Just‚Ä¶ never fixed. The rip was there as if it had never been patched at all.

For a moment, I stood there frozen, my heart beating faster than it should. I blinked, rubbed my eyes, blinked again. Same rip. Same rough edges.

*Maybe I dreamed that it was patched. Yeah, maybe that‚Äôs it.*

Breakfast went the same way. Two slices of toast, coffee black. Except this time, the toast popped up before I‚Äôd even pushed the lever down. I laughed nervously. Malfunction, I thought. Everything breaks down eventually.

I ate quickly, half-convincing myself it was fine. My watch ticked steady this time, no twitching, and for some reason, that made me feel worse. Like it knew I was watching.

When I stepped outside, the street was quieter than usual. No joggers. No cars. The air itself felt still, thick, as if sound had been muffled.

By the time I reached my car, a single vehicle rolled past, a black sedan with tinted windows. It slowed as it passed my driveway, almost stopping. My reflection stared back at me in its windows. Then it sped off without a sound.

I got in my car and turned on the radio. Same Taylor Swift song. Same exact lyric. Same tone.

I laughed this time, a strained little chuckle. *‚ÄúYou‚Äôve gotta be kidding me.‚Äù*

I switched stations. Static. Switched again. Same song. Switched again. Silence. Then a faint voice:

*‚ÄúYou‚Äôre late today.‚Äù*

I froze. The voice was low, faint, maybe the radio host, maybe just interference. I turned the knob down. My pulse thundered. *Just* background *chatter,* I told myself. *Coincidence.*

When I got to the caf√©, the same barista smiled at me from behind the counter. Same hair, same tone.

*‚ÄúMorning, sir,‚Äù* Janice said.

Her lips moved exactly the same way as yesterday. Every blink, every tilt of her head was identical. Like a playback.

I stood there, smiling stiffly. *‚ÄúUh, yeah. Morning.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúThe usual?‚Äù* she asked.

*‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù*

She reached for a cup, then froze mid-motion. For a full second, she didn‚Äôt move, hand suspended over the cup rack, smile frozen. Then, as if someone had pressed play again, she continued like nothing happened.

My throat went dry.

When she handed me the coffee, her fingers brushed mine, and they were *cold.* Not normal cold, refrigerator cold.

*‚ÄúHave a great day,‚Äù* she said, the same exact tone as yesterday.

I stepped back, heartbeat pounding, the cup trembling slightly in my grip.

Outside, I sat in my car and stared into my coffee. My reflection wavered in the black surface. For half a second, I saw another face behind mine, blurred, unfamiliar.

Then it was gone.

I drove to work, trying not to think. The streets looked the same, but‚Ä¶ off. The same car, the black sedan, passed me three times, always from a different direction. Same license plate. Same slow roll past my car.

When I reached the office, the receptionist greeted me the same way. Same smile, same *‚ÄúGood morning.‚Äù* I wanted to say something, *do you remember saying that yesterday? Do you ever say anything else?* \- but I didn‚Äôt.

My cubicle was spotless again. The mug I‚Äôd left half-full was cleaned, replaced in its exact position. My papers were aligned perfectly. Someone had been there, but everything looked untouched.

I sat down, powered on my computer, and opened my inbox. For a long time, I just stared.

No *‚ÄúWAKE UP‚Äù* email this time. Everything normal. Meetings. Memos. Spam.

Then, at the bottom of the screen, just as I was about to minimize the window, a small pop-up appeared:

**DO YOU REMEMBER YET?**

I blinked. It was gone. No window, no alert history, nothing in the taskbar.

My skin crawled.

I stood, walking toward the bathroom. On the way, I passed John from accounting.

*‚ÄúMorning,‚Äù* I said.

He looked up, smiled the same stiff smile as yesterday. *‚ÄúMorning.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúHey, John, weird question,‚Äù I said, forcing a laugh. ‚ÄúYou ever feel like‚Ä¶ we‚Äôve done this before?‚Äù*

He blinked. *‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù*

*‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. Like the same exact day, same stuff, same conversations.‚Äù*

He tilted his head slightly. *‚ÄúYou should get more sleep,‚Äù he said, still smiling.*

*‚ÄúYeah, probably,‚Äù* I muttered, brushing past him.

When I looked back, he was still standing there, staring after me, not smiling.

In the bathroom, I splashed cold water on my face. Looked in the mirror.

My reflection lagged.

Not a trick of the light. Not tired eyes. It *lagged.* A half-second delay before mimicking my movements.

I stumbled back, heart hammering, hands gripping the sink. My reflection smiled, a fraction too wide,  before catching up to me.

Then, faintly, I heard it again. The radio voice, whispering from somewhere beyond the tiles:

**Wake up**

I slammed the faucet off. Silence.

When I returned to my cubicle, my coffee was gone. My desk was perfectly clean again. And on my monitor, a single open email waited for me, no sender, no subject, no body. Just one line of text in the preview pane:

This was after waiting in line for like 20 minutes for the drink. I saw that this was also happening for a bunch of other drinks that were sitting in the mobile pickup counter as well. The coffees were all missing like an inch of the actual drink or more.

I‚Äôm 37 years old. I currently manage a successful caf√©. 

My interest throughout basically my whole life have always been food, coffee, gaming, and sports. When I originally had the idea of opening my own spot, I loved the idea of an upscale caf√©, until I realize the state that I live in is saturated with such. So I have to think outside the box.

About an hour from where I live, there is a place and it‚Äôs basically a spot where they have a mini indoor playground and they serve some specialty lattes along with some snacks/kid styled food. And kind of love the idea, especially having three kids of my own. 

My thoughts would be to open something similar to this. With an area that has a mini indoor playground where kids could have some fun, a room with Legos, a giant chalkboard where they can color, various books etc. Also like the idea of adding in some gaming consoles and a couple of arcade games for the ones whom like that kind of thing (like me lol).

And then there would also be an area to get some specialty lattes along with a smaller, but high quality food menu. 

Plenty of seating. Comfortable couches. And some tables and chairs where people can eat and enjoy their coffee while their kids play.  

Would be open 7 days a week from 7-3

All of this is just kind of spitballing, but would love to hear your guys thoughts if this sounds like a potential good idea or if I would just be wasting my time and money. 

My first thought would be to call it ‚ÄúStay and play Cafe‚Äù",1,1759947278.0,smallbusiness,1,1.0,False

Am I just crazy?,"I was in a relationship roughly 3 years ago with a boy I had a crush on for a long time. We were together for about 10 months before we broke up. I was crushed. I literally went through the worst phase of my life back then. I was so obsessed with getting him back I tried literally everything. I mean everything. I prayed to God (I‚Äôm an atheist), i did some ‚Äúspells‚Äù i found on reddit, met his sister for coffee, had my dad text him and the list is long. I wonder if some of these ‚Äúspells‚Äù (I‚Äôm positive it was all bs but still) worked and in addition to being intimate during my period created a soul tie? 
You may ask why I‚Äôm talking about this now so I will explain. We haven‚Äôt talked since September 2023 when he dumped me (kind of we were just talking) again. Since then I haven‚Äôt tried to talk with him or anything again. So thats when I started talking to my current partner. I love him very much and for the first time i don‚Äôt feel trapped in a relationship and I actually enjoy it. The weird thing is sometimes I dream about the ex. And when I do he happens to break up with his new partners. It has happened 3 times. The reason I connect dreaming about him and him breaking up with them is because I learn of it a few days after I dream about him. Two times I learned from different people, including my own stepdad, but the last time I was curious if it happened again so I checked his social media profile and that‚Äôs how i found out. Mind you before I dream about him I don‚Äôt think or talk or anything about or with him. I don‚Äôt occasionally think of him (because I don‚Äôt care anymore and I love my new partner). So idk if this is a soul tie or just a coincidence that happens to repeat itself. 
If this sounds like a soul tie please help me undo it, I don‚Äôt want anything to do with him anymore I just want to be happy with my current partner. ",1,1759947066.0,spirituality,1,1.0,False
1o1i5mi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1o1i5mi/dream_crossover_between_two_people_into_real_life/,"Dream crossover between two people, into real life. Possible demonic activity","This is going to be VERY long, just a warning. I'm going to keep it long for sincerity/story telling sake so one can really walk through it like I did.

This happened several months ago.

I'm just going to try to explain plainly as I experienced/witnessed these events.

I was out to eat with my mom and I was listening to her talk and try to think about good things to talk about. She tends to heavily focus on negative things worst outcomes, appearances, ect. Anytime I would speak about something, it's like she just wasn't really listening. That's less besides the point, but something I heavily noted that day.

She kept talking about my sister in a very negative way, it felt like everything she said was a lie or something to make her look good and everyone else look bad, flattery, I don't know what else to say. Just stuff that felt SUPER magnified that day.

Well she drops me off at home, and that night when I sleep, I wake up in this dark nightmare. It is a empty back street in some industrial piece of s city in the dark of night, I walk into this delapitated warehouse and I begin to sense something deeply wrong. I began to sense and feel that something is very wrong, and this deep sense that my mom was lost, and I NEED t find her.

The moment I felt this feeling, my sister and a few of her friends emerged from a room in the warehouse and asking me to stay and have fun with them, just stay and party no one was missing and everyone is fine. They were all moving in this weird dancing fashion, almost like snake charmers. They bore the resemblance of my sister rand her friends, yet I knew it wasn't them. I told them I had to go find my Mom, and she was missing, and I began to leave. The feeling was immense and completely unmistakable.

It was akin to someone holding a hot spoon on your skin. Loud, clear, and not going away until someone takes the spoon away, but I had no idea who was holding, where it was, and how to take it off, yet it persisted. That's the best way I could describe it.

So the dream gets a little fuzzy at this part, as I'm essentially just wondering dark alleys and corners searching for her, but I can't find her. I weirdly was not afraid in the dream, the hunger to find her nullified any other feelings. As I walked, for what felt like a shuffled selections of hours, I walk back to the warehouse.

I walk back in, and in the room my ""sister and her friends"" are drinking, and I feel an urgency now beginning to multiply, I start yelling at my sister, ""don't you feel that?? Doesn't any of you feel that? Something is wrong! Mom is gone! Don't you feel that?"" And in their strange wind like movement they boldly tell me again to call down, and everything is fine, in a strange stage like melodic tone. 

At the moment I begin to see sirens and many cop cars/ambulances pull up around the factory. I peer out the window and see what appears to be giant blood smears all over the concrete with varying parts of bodies to go with it. In my dream I'm still reacting as myself and as if my dream sister and friends are who they say they are, so I begin to guard the windows and say ""Don't look out the windows! Do not look!"" And gutteral screams, inhuman almost begin to echo all around the outside of the factory as sirens start and more lights. The screams are bouncing around in different locations systemically while sounding like the same being. 

My sister and her friends begin moving my arms in their strange snaket movements pleeing for me to move my hands from the window so they could see, like they WANTED to, like they loved it (a new unsettling feeling that started to take over). 

And then I woke up.

I took note that it felt like a demonic dream, but soon continued with my day, prayed some, continued on. 

Until my Mom called and wanted to hang out again, interesting I thought, and she came to pick me up. On the way to the casino, she looks over and says ""oh my God I have to tell you about my dream!"" As I began to be flooded with the oranges and feelings of mine, I was like oh my God me too! I told her to go first, for I wanted to see if there was anything weird and connected, for I've studied these things for a long time.

Then she tells me she has a dream she is STUCK somewhere and cannot get out. It is scary and dark and no one can find her. As she driving she points to one of those orange highway barrels and said it was like that, like 3 of them stacked up and she was in this black tube UNDERGROUND, and when she looked down she could see big hooves walk up to check the tube, like something with goat legs is walking up to the tube and looking in, yet all she can see is under the tube.

Shocked, I then detail my dream to her.

She then says.... ""-Insert name-... That is SO weird because I fell asleep watching dawn of the dead last night"" which, whatever one she watched they were running or hiding in a warehouse as the zombies were chasing them ripping folks apart.

So it could end here, it's like okay... Very strange. I had no idea she watched the dawn of the dead, it's weird enough it crossed over into my awareness in my dreams, but it gets weirder.

I've been studying spiritual matters for a long time, and on a side Note (it is the main note, really), Jesus Christ is the Son of God, and prayers to Him and his angels are the only thing that works against these forces. At the point in time I've been studying it for awhile and talking with my Mom about it because I do fear for her sometimes, and I believe some choices may be leading her down a wrong path. But it's like the more I spoke with her about Jesus the more this stuff would begin to happen, almost to try and scare me off.

Anyways back to the weirder part, she kind of brushes off the whole thing as we walk into the casino and I cannot stop thinking about it. I was like Mom, don't you see how weird that is though? Like why/how do you think that happened? This dream thing? Then she just continued to brush it off and yes it's weird but let's have fun, and I obliged to the best of my ability, yet I couldn't stop thinking about it.

We leave the casino, and on our way home we stop at a gas station. My mom at the counter, immediately goes on high alert and starts nudging me to look at this man in a fishing hat, I've never seen him before. She whispers,"" there is something wrong with that guy, something evil idk why -insert my name- do you see or feel anything?"" And I immediately start praying and saying the name of Jesus in my mind/heart, and I just say well I'm praying now let's go. We leave and she tells me in the car the guy made her feel like ""something from the nightmare"", like the evil presence in her nightmares similar to the one she just had we spoke about. Weird. I take note.

Once again this man is wearing shorts, normal shirt, and a fishing hat. Fishing boots too, like fot a creek, the rubber half shin length kind. After, My mom drops me off and i have a normal night, wake up, and go to get coffee with my bf the next day. 

As we are driving up the road from our house, I get a weird feeling, I look up and see the man in the fishing outfit walking down the road. I don't say anything and then my bf says ""Oh, it's that guy. He's weird. He comes into our store all the time and says weird shit and laughs"". Remembering what my mom said about Him and the dreams and the weird timing of his presence I ask Him what kind of stuff he says. (My bf works at a tobacco store). He says he comes in, but never buys anything. He comes in and cackles and says ""I have some stuff to return"" and continues to laugh and look around. There are signs everywhere in the building that say ""NO RETURNS"". 

Immediately I thought oh wow, talk about a classic sinister villain. I started to subtly piece together that if this was a person, they are under the influence of something dark, yet they are popping up this exact time this weird dream thing happened. Whatever it is darkness is involved. And the coincidence of this strange man being present with ""evil"" vibes the day after this happened is just too strange for me. I said this to my bf and told the store of my mom and are dreams and he brushed it off as well like, nah he's just a weird guy on drugs. 

Fast forward to the next day. So this is the third day of this saga, two days from the original warehouse lost mom dream, it's midday and I'm considering going to the dispensary. But I have this weird feeling about it. I begin to feel off and dizzy physically, like when walking down the hallway to grab my keys I'm wobbling slightly as I walk, and I don't know why. He offers to drive me there but in a prideful manner I refuse and say No, I've been doing it myself a long time I can do it, but tbh I was being a bit of an asshole for reason I don't know. Built of resentment from past occurrences id say, just a sad side note. I then walk out to my car and I just sit there. I feel this lie sucking dread come over me. Like this, ""Do not go"" feeling and I don't know why.

Though I have my whits about me, and I have many paranormal things occur, I wanted to battle this feeling. J didn't want to believe I was feeling it, and I wanted to push through. I begin to question my sanity and why this was happening out of seemingly no where. So I blast through, I start the car, and pull out of my neighborhood. The second I pull out of the stop sign, I turn to my right, and maybe 10 yards away, walking on the sidewalk right towards my car, is the fishing hat dude. Except this time, as I turned looked at his face, it appeared twisted, like someone put a filter over his face. Like, it reminded me when I don't where my glasses, that's how I could describe it.

As if I was wearing my glasses everywhere but his face? Like a diffused look, yet it was slightly twisting in a manner so ilar to a spiral. I immediately said HELL NO, turned to the left, made a circle, and drove back home. 

 I didn't seen Him for months, nor did I see him EVER before that yet apparently my bf sees Him all the time around town (I drive through town daily yet never encountered him), yet he just appears for three days straight after this very demonic and connected dream with my mom? And he's saying like classic twisted lies laughing maniacally in stores he goes into prior to this?

But yeah the last time I saw Him, I shit you not again, I know it seems like I'm making this up but I have nothing to gain, I just need to get this out... But I met up with an old friend I haven't seen in literally 10 years or more, I didn't think I'd see him again honestly. We met up for coffee and chatted, and to my surprise he bought up dreams, good/evil ect. I ended up telling him about the fishing hat guy, and during the story he was visibly uncomfortable. On the way home to drop me off, guess who we saw walking up the same road to my neighborhood? It was him again.

Before I even had a chance to point him out to my friend driving, he just said ""Oh my God it's him"".

I haven't seen him since. Besides this written story i don't want to focus on it too much unless it were to benefit someone else. I tell this story to hopefully shed light on what appears to just be dreams or something yet perhaps Is sort of a spiritual warfare. 

If strange occurrences like this happen to you, I highly encourage you to shield yourself with the word of God and learn about Jesus. Jesus is the only enemy of evil, and according to His life and death and resurrection, that event itself have authority to human to rebuke these evil things in His name, since his name and life itself literally carries the power to do so, I have witnessed it first hand.

I've come to this conclusion after being heavily into ""occult"" and ""new age"" concepts for almost 15 years.",1,1759947053.0,Paranormal,1,1.0,False

i know that my life is good comparatively and i have privileges like access to doctors and medicine, but i am so tired of living, so tired of trying, it never ends. a lot of days i feel like it would be easier to stop trying, stop working on getting better, giving up. i wouldn‚Äôt say that i‚Äôm suicidal because if i died i know it would hurt others terribly and i never want that to happen, but i wouldn‚Äôt necessarily say that i want to live either.

i feel like i should want to get better, like i should be trying everything to improve and heal, but i, i don‚Äôt always. even now i‚Äôm lightly censoring myself in this post because writing the truth hurts. it feels like no matter how much i try, no matter what i do, i will always return back to this hellish feeling. my body will continue to give out, my mental status will always be fragile and wavering, and i will always be tired. i can‚Äôt bring myself to tell my therapist this because it makes it real, and i feel like after 10 years i should be better. 

i continue to self sabotage because i don‚Äôt see the point in anything and i want to have an external reason to why i feel this way rather than admitting it‚Äôs me.
i don‚Äôt know the point of writing this, but i felt like i needed to say it.

**Why This Pick?**

The Blue Jays are playing a bullpen game this evening, friends. And after yesterday‚Äôs game, I just don‚Äôt know how much gas the Toronto bullpen has in the tank. On the other side, Yankees starter Cam Schlitter‚Äôs (2.96 ERA) last 5 straight starts have resulted in a NY win; 4 of those 5 victories were by at least 2 runs. It‚Äôs looking like the Blue Jays will put Louis Varland (2.97 ERA) on the mound first, who allowed 2 HRs on just 2 hits (including the diabolical HR by Aaron Judge‚Ä¶) in last night‚Äôs showdown. With the Over being 3-0 so far in this series and given the circumstances of today‚Äôs encounter, I‚Äôve gotta put my money on another high-scoring affair.

Day 2: Ate a grass-fed/finished 12oz beef NY Strip and 2 eggs for breakfast cooked in ghee, and drank some black coffee. For lunch I had 8 chicken wings cooker in garlic compound ghee with some cracked black peeper and shaved parmesan and pecorino Romano. Dinner I had 4 Maxwell street polish sausages, and I had \~140oz of water with electrolytes

Today: I've had a 6 oz grass-fed/finished beef burger patty and 2 eggs cooked in ghee for breakfast, a small bowl of Greek yogurt, and had 2 medium chicken breasts for lunch. Dinner will likely be 2 or 3 cans of albacore tuna.

1o1hxl6,https://v.redd.it/3osupjbcfxtf1,üö® NEVER Judge a Book By its Cover!,"Hi everyone!



This is a solo UBI project, built on thousands of hours of unpaid work over 4.5 years ‚Äî underpinned by the psychological stress of great economic uncertainty. If it had been done by an actual agency, at a relatively modest rate of $100/hour, and taking the same amount of time it took me, it would probably have cost at least a couple hundred thousand dollars. In other words, I really had to put the power of intrinsic motivation ‚Äî which UBI proponents often talk about ‚Äî to the test, risking everything, including my own sanity, in the process. But fun, serendipitous incidents along the way helped keep me encouraged. For instance, at one point, out of nowhere, the project even received a comment of admiration from none other than Floyd Marinescu, the founder of UBI Works. :)



There are two components to this project. What you‚Äôre seeing here is just the offline ‚Äî real-world ‚Äî part. It connects directly to the online side through QR codes on stickers placed in public spaces. These stickers are designed to be spread globally through supporters like you, even appearing in caf√©s through paid agreements with owners ‚Äî making sure they can‚Äôt simply be removed or ignored. And why stop there? In the spirit of dreaming big, I imagine even billboards one day, reaching who knows how many more. :)



With your financial support, this vision can grow far beyond its beginnings. Together we can ensure the project keeps evolving, touching more people, and sparking greater impact over time. The proof of concept is already here ‚Äî just scroll down to the video to see it in action. And imagine what we can build together over time.



Please forgive the fact that the messaging under the images that follow reads as if there are more people than just me working on the project. Interpret that as me simply hoping that one day it will be that way. :) It‚Äôs inspired by the vision that I‚Äôll eventually be able to take help from experts in each field involved, should I manage to garner enough interest for the project to keep going. How many fields? By my count, about 10.



My main point is this: we have two choices. We can wait for UBI to arrive someday, or we can actively fight in every creative way we can imagine to bring it closer. I chose the latter.



I didn‚Äôt start this project because I wanted it to be necessary for UBI‚Äôs success. I started it to contribute an original idea ‚Äî one that could help younger generations grow up familiar with the concept, so that by the time they reach positions of influence, UBI feels natural to them. If UBI‚Äôs realization really does end up depending on neuroplasticity, meaning the inability for older minds in power to take radical-sounding ideas seriously, then early exposure might matter more than we think.



Meanwhile, just look at the numbers: content about UBI gets an abysmally low amount of engagement online. Algorithms across platforms are clearly selecting against it. That means we can‚Äôt just rely on traditional advocacy ‚Äî we need creative, alternative ways to spread the idea.



And if anyone believes that AI alone will force governments to hand out UBI tomorrow, remember the term ‚Äúbullshit jobs.‚Äù Governments have an endless ability to invent meaningless work simply to keep people busy, even when it serves no real purpose. Like any idea that liberates people, such as the 40-hour work week, UBI won‚Äôt just ‚Äúarrive‚Äù ‚Äî we have to actively push it into existence. And seeding young minds with the idea, can't possibly be a bad thing.



My hope was that most UBI supporters would see the value in contributing something as small as the price of a coffee each month to a project like this ‚Äî whether or not it proves to be the decisive piece in UBI‚Äôs success. But perhaps I was wrong. It wouldn't be the first time.







Kind regards,



SL





(If you care about the personal sacrifice and the actual work behind it all, you should read the P.S.) :)



P.S. It might also be worth noting that when people try to judge the effort behind a project like this, they often overlook all the experimental work that went into it ‚Äî simply because it‚Äôs never seen. And even when you settle on something, there's ample work to be done. The animation work alone is an incredibly finicky affair that takes huge amounts of time to get right. Then there's sound and storytelling that requires a lot of thinking and planning ahead of time in terms of how the character story ‚Äî that communicates a message, parallel to the deeper main one, about society and the natural generational tensions between generations ‚Äî evolves through each new ""cookie"" or ""UBI-insight"". Up next there's the layout of graphics on the online platform the project resides on. After that, the planning for the next insight, and the one after that ‚Äî and just how you'll tell those next chapters with all the mentioned elements involved. I think you get the picture. I could go on and on. Basically, everything takes huge cognitive effort ‚Äî and time. This is further compounded by the debilitating long COVID symptoms affecting my focus, which I‚Äôve been managing throughout all these years working on the project. And countless sleepless nights lying awake with difficulties turning off the obsessing creative mind. The struggle is also expressed through the pain of countless mistakes and restarts along the way, the challenge of keeping scope creep in check, and the effort of maintaining visual consistency across all the different parts as you move from one conviction of how it should look to the next. And let‚Äôs not even mention the psychological struggle of having to assess the quality of one‚Äôs own work entirely on one‚Äôs own ‚Äî while not being an expert in any of the fields involved. In any case, hundreds of thousands of headache-inducing micro-decisions later, here we are. Were they all perfect? Most certainly not. Was my execution flawless? Not a chance! But I hope you agree with the hypothesis underpinning it all, and see enough potential in the concept to make you at least a bit curious about where it could all go ‚Äî especially if people like you show some support, however small it may be.



Finally ‚Äî needless to say ‚Äî presenting your work to the world after so much dedication and struggle is, frankly, a terrifying thing. So please keep all of this in mind when judging or commenting on it. ;)





\-------- THE Sticky PITCH starts here --------





‚òï Would you Support a NOVEL UBI-related IDEA with just a coffee a month?



Look. I Get it. We all want UBI to happen YESTERDAY, but Patience and Hard Work on All Levels is what I believe eventually gets us there.



üåç The Project:

A new way to introduce UBI to Younger Generations ‚Äî

through Quirky Stickers (even in 3D form) that INVITE INTERACTION (see images), connecting to Weird, intentionally bite-sized and Funny ANIMATIONS designed to drive interactivity (""gamification"") ‚Äî plus small CHALLENGES (puzzles), that immediately test what was just communicated, and UBI VIDEOS online. The tempo and music of the animations themselves are intentionally just stressful enough to get the viewer‚Äôs heart pounding in order to make them feel the message as intensely as possible, but not so much as to be scary. 

‚û°Ô∏è It's all Engineered to be ""Sticky"" in the mind.

1o1hwye,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_WordAppropriate3443/comments/1o1hwye/when_someone_you_love_joins_a_cult_understanding/,When Someone You Love Joins a Cult: Understanding Grief and Finding Hope,"The phone calls stopped coming. Family gatherings became tense, then rare, then nonexistent. The person you once knew‚Äîyour sibling, child, parent, or friend‚Äîseems to have vanished, replaced by someone who speaks in unfamiliar phrases and looks at you with suspicion or hostility. If someone you love has joined a cult, you're experiencing one of the most complex forms of grief imaginable: mourning someone who is still alive but no longer accessible to you.

**Understanding Cults and Their Appeal**

A cult is typically defined as a group with extreme beliefs or practices that uses manipulative techniques to control its members. These groups often revolve around a charismatic leader who claims special knowledge or divine connection. What distinguishes cults from other religious or philosophical groups is their use of coercive persuasion, isolation tactics, and the gradual erosion of members' critical thinking abilities.

People aren't drawn to cults because they're weak or foolish. In fact, cult recruitment often targets intelligent, idealistic individuals during vulnerable periods in their lives. Common factors that make someone susceptible include:

* **Life transitions**: Moving to a new city, starting college, divorce, job loss, or the death of a loved one
* **Idealism**: A genuine desire to make the world better or find deeper meaning
* **Loneliness**: Seeking community and belonging
* **Spiritual searching**: Looking for answers to life's big questions
* **Personal crisis**: Depression, anxiety, or feeling lost

Cults exploit these natural human needs through love-bombing (overwhelming attention and affection), providing simple answers to complex problems, and creating a sense of being ""chosen"" or special.

**The Insidious Process of Indoctrination**

Indoctrination doesn't happen overnight. It's a gradual process that skilled manipulators orchestrate with frightening precision:

**Step 1: Love-bombing and Special Attention**  
 New recruits are showered with attention, praise, and affection. They're made to feel understood and valued in ways they may never have experienced before.

**Step 2: Gradual Isolation**  
 Slowly, the group begins to drive wedges between the new member and their outside relationships. Family and friends are portrayed as negative influences, obstacles to spiritual growth, or even enemies.

**Step 3: Information Control**  
 Members are discouraged or forbidden from consuming outside media, reading certain books, or seeking information that contradicts the group's teachings.

**Step 4: Sleep Deprivation and Overwhelm**  
 Through constant activities, meetings, and responsibilities, members become exhausted and lose their ability to think critically.

**Step 5: Financial and Social Dependence**  
 Members often give money, property, or labor to the group while becoming increasingly dependent on it for housing, employment, and social connections.

**Step 6: Thought Stopping**  
 Through repetitive chanting, meditation, or other practices, members learn to shut down doubts or critical thoughts.

**The Heartbreak of Watching Someone Change**

For those on the outside, watching this transformation is devastating. The person you knew seems to disappear before your eyes, replaced by someone who:

* Speaks in the group's jargon and catchphrases
* Shows little interest in former hobbies, friends, or family traditions
* Becomes defensive or angry when the group is questioned
* Seems to have lost their sense of humor or individual personality
* Views the world in stark black-and-white terms
* May even become hostile toward former loved ones

This isn't the person choosing to reject you‚Äîit's the result of systematic psychological manipulation. Understanding this doesn't make it hurt less, but it can help you remember that the person you love is still in there, even when they seem unreachable.

**The Unique Nature of Cult-Related Grief**

Grieving someone who has joined a cult is unlike any other form of loss. It's a grief without closure, without community understanding, and without the rituals that normally help us process loss.

**What Cult Grief Feels Like**

**The Phantom Limb of Relationships**: Just as amputees feel sensation in missing limbs, you may find yourself reaching for your phone to call them about something funny, or saving up stories to share, only to remember they're no longer emotionally available. The muscle memory of your relationship remains even when the person is gone.

**Emotional Whiplash**: One day you're angry at their choices, the next you're heartbroken by their absence, then consumed with worry about their wellbeing. These feelings can cycle rapidly, leaving you emotionally exhausted and confused about how you're ""supposed"" to feel.

**The Cruelest Hope**: Unlike death, where finality eventually allows healing to begin, cult involvement dangles the possibility of return like a carrot just out of reach. Every birthday that passes without a call, every holiday they miss, every milestone they're absent from reopens the wound.

**Living with a Ghost**: They may still exist in your contacts, their bedroom might remain unchanged, their favorite coffee mug still sits in your cupboard. These physical reminders of their presence make their emotional absence even more stark.

**How Cult Grief Differs from Death**

**Death has rituals; cult loss has silence**: When someone dies, there are funerals, mourning periods, and social support systems. When someone joins a cult, there's no ceremony to mark the loss, no casseroles from neighbors, no bereavement leave from work. You're expected to function normally while your heart is breaking.

**Death has finality; cult loss has endless uncertainty**: Death, while painful, provides closure. With cult involvement, you're left wondering: Are they safe? Are they happy? Are they being hurt? Will they ever come back? The questions never stop, and neither does the pain.

**Death brings sympathy; cult loss brings judgment**: When someone dies, people offer condolences. When someone joins a cult, people often offer opinions: ""How could you let this happen?"" ""Why don't you just talk to them?"" ""If they really loved you, they'd leave."" This judgment adds shame to an already unbearable situation.

**Death allows anger to eventually soften; cult loss involves ongoing rejection**: With death, any unresolved conflicts eventually give way to love and forgiveness. With cult involvement, the person actively rejects you, often with cruel words and cold dismissal. Each interaction can inflict new wounds.

**Understanding Their Anger and Isolation**

When your loved one becomes hostile or cuts contact, it's crucial to understand that this isn't really them talking‚Äîit's the cult's programming. Cults systematically turn members against their families through several mechanisms:

**The ""Us vs. Them"" Mentality**: Cults create an artificial division between the ""enlightened"" group and the ""unenlightened"" world. Your loved one has been taught to see you as spiritually inferior, dangerous, or even evil.

**Cognitive Dissonance**: Deep down, they may miss you terribly but admitting this would contradict everything they've been taught. To resolve this internal conflict, they may increase their hostility as a way of convincing themselves they made the right choice.

**Fear-Based Conditioning**: They may genuinely believe that maintaining contact with you will harm their spiritual progress, endanger their salvation, or bring negative consequences to their life.

**Loyalty Tests**: The cult may use their willingness to cut off family as a test of commitment. Maintaining hostile behavior toward you becomes proof of their dedication to the group.

**How Not to Take It Personally**

This is perhaps the hardest part: the person you love is saying hurtful things and treating you like an enemy. Here are ways to protect your heart:

**Remember Who's Really Talking**: When they're cruel or dismissive, try to separate the words from the person. This isn't your child, sibling, or friend speaking‚Äîit's the cult's programming. The person you love is still in there, trapped and manipulated.

**Understand Their Internal War**: Their hostility often masks deep pain and confusion. They may be fighting against their love for you because that love threatens their new identity. The stronger their original bond with you, the more aggressive they may need to be to suppress it.

**Recognize Defensive Behavior**: Sometimes their anger is really fear‚Äîfear that you might be right, fear that they've made a mistake, fear of the consequences of leaving. Attacking you becomes a way of avoiding these terrifying thoughts.

**Document Their True Self**: Keep letters, photos, and videos that remind you of who they really are. When they're cruel to you, look at these reminders of the loving person they were before the manipulation began.

**Coping Strategies for Families**

While there's no simple solution to this heartbreak, there are ways to cope and maintain hope:

**Educate Yourself**

Learn about cult dynamics, thought control, and recovery processes. Understanding what your loved one is experiencing can help you respond more effectively and maintain compassion even in the face of hostility.

**Seek Support**

Connect with other families who have experienced cult involvement. Organizations like the International Cultic Studies Association (ICSA) offer resources and support groups. Consider therapy with someone who understands cult dynamics.

**Maintain Open Doors**

When possible, avoid ultimatums or burning bridges. Keep communication lines open, even if contact is minimal. Send birthday cards, leave voicemails expressing love, and let them know they're always welcome home.

**Document the Person You Knew**

Keep photos, videos, and mementos that remind you of who your loved one was before the cult. This can help you maintain hope and connection to their authentic self.

**Accepting What You Cannot Control**

One of the most important‚Äîand most difficult‚Äîlessons in this journey is accepting that you have no control over your loved one's choices. This powerlessness can be maddening, especially when you can see so clearly how they're being manipulated and harmed.

**You Cannot Love Them Out of a Cult**: No amount of pleading, reasoning, or demonstrating your love will override the systematic thought control they're experiencing. Accepting this doesn't mean giving up hope‚Äîit means channeling your energy more effectively.

**Their Journey is Their Own**: As heartbreaking as it is to watch someone you love make destructive choices, you must respect their autonomy as an adult human being. They have the right to make mistakes, even devastating ones.

**Focus on Your Circle of Influence**: While you can't control their choices, you can control your responses. You can choose to remain loving rather than bitter, hopeful rather than despairing, and healthy rather than consumed by grief.

**Release the Outcome**: This doesn't mean stopping your efforts or giving up hope. It means holding your love for them lightly, without attachment to a specific timeline or result. Some people leave cults quickly; others take decades; some never leave at all. Your love for them isn't dependent on their choices.

**The Critical Importance of Self-Care**

Grieving someone lost to a cult can consume your entire existence if you let it. Many family members develop what experts call ""secondary trauma""‚ÄîPTSD-like symptoms from watching someone they love be systematically destroyed. Self-care isn't selfish; it's essential for your survival and for your ability to be there if and when your loved one needs you.

**Permission to Live Your Life**: You may feel guilty for enjoying moments of happiness while your loved one suffers. But living a full, meaningful life isn't a betrayal‚Äîit's what they would want for you if they were thinking clearly. Your joy doesn't diminish your love for them.

**Maintain Your Other Relationships**: Don't let this grief poison your connections with other family members and friends. These relationships are your lifeline, and they matter independently of what's happening with your loved one in the cult.

**Pursue Your Interests and Goals**: Continue working toward your dreams, enjoying your hobbies, and building the life you want. Putting your entire existence on hold won't bring them back, but it will rob you of precious years you can never recover.

**Set Boundaries Around Your Grief**: Designate specific times for worrying or researching cult-related information. Don't let these activities bleed into every moment of your day. Create worry-free zones in your schedule where you focus on other aspects of your life.

**Practice Radical Acceptance**: Accept that this situation may last longer than you hope. Accept that recovery, if it comes, may be slow and imperfect. Accept that your relationship with this person may never be the same, even if they leave the cult. This acceptance isn't giving up‚Äîit's making peace with reality so you can respond from a place of clarity rather than desperation.

**Monitor Your Mental Health**: Watch for signs of depression, anxiety, or complicated grief. If you're having trouble sleeping, eating, or functioning at work, seek professional help. Taking care of your mental health helps everyone, including your loved one.

**Create Meaning from Your Pain**: Many families find that their experience, while unwanted, gives them a deeper understanding of love, resilience, and the preciousness of free thought. Some become advocates for cult awareness. Others simply become more appreciative of the relationships that remain healthy in their lives.

**Be Patient**

Recovery from cult involvement is possible, but it often takes years, not months. Many former cult members report that the love and patience of family members was crucial to their eventual departure.

**Signs of Possible Departure**

While you can't force someone to leave a cult, you can watch for signs that they might be becoming disillusioned:

* Asking questions about outside life
* Expressing doubts about leaders or teachings
* Seeming tired or burned out
* Showing interest in former hobbies or relationships
* Requesting help with practical matters

If you notice these signs, respond with love and support rather than ""I told you so"" attitudes.

**For Those Who Have Left**

If your loved one does leave the cult, remember that recovery is a process. Former cult members often struggle with:

* Guilt and shame about their involvement
* Difficulty making decisions after years of having choices made for them
* Social anxiety and trouble forming relationships
* Depression and post-traumatic stress
* Practical challenges like rebuilding careers or education

Professional counseling with someone experienced in cult recovery can be invaluable during this transition.

**Finding Meaning in the Pain**

While no one would choose this experience, many families find that it ultimately deepens their understanding of love, resilience, and the human capacity for both manipulation and healing. Some channel their pain into advocacy work, helping other families navigate similar situations.

Remember that love is not measured by our ability to control or ""save"" others, but by our willingness to remain present even when it's painful. Your love for this person matters, even when they can't receive it. That love may be the lighthouse that eventually guides them home.

1o1hw5q,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1o1hw5q/losing_10_kg_15_of_body_weight_in_one_month/,"Losing 10 kg, ~15% of body weight in ~one month","Hi y‚Äôall, i‚Äôm quite scared tbh.
I am a 23 year old, 176 cm high white female with a personal background only of mental health diagnoses.


One month ago I came to visit my mom and weighted, I was 67.7 kg then and felt quite good physically, but was still affected by chronic stress/anxiety and depression somewhat. 

My appetite is, I would say, normal, then even worse than now.

I eat healthy food 3 times a day, often drink up to 5 cans of beer at night, and every 3-4 days I eat extremely calorie heavy fast food for dinner (my typical Mcdonald‚Äôs order is a Big Mac, Large fries, 9 piece nuggets and two sauces). 

This is the diet that I‚Äôve been following for half a year now, I didn‚Äôt ever gain weight rapidly in my life (despite when going trough puberty), it was always a slow gain up to 2-3 kg a month. 

This day I weighted again, now weighing 58.0kg despite being 59.1kg 2-3 days ago. 

I did not change my diet, I still drink beer and eat sweets, sugar and bread. 

My family has a history of Uterine problems, my great grandma died because of it, my grandma is perfectly fine in that regard, my mom had a benign tumor and had her uterus removed, she never lost weight that rapidly (at least without the help of Ozempic which she used without prescription to lose weight, I don‚Äôt use something like that).
Our family does not have known Gastrointestinal Cancer history. 
I do not have any other info about my great grandma despite her diagnosis. 

I‚Äôm on medications such as Venlafaxine (75 mg for 3 months every day, almost completely tapered down in 2 months. Didn‚Äôt use it right anyways, missed doses and got off of it because I hated it, and I‚Äôm Bipolar, we tend to ditch drugs). I‚Äôve taken Venlafaxine before and never had weight fluctuations on it; Guanfacine - 1mg for one week for now (for ADHD, stimulant use is illegal where I live), and Lamotrigine - 25mg (for 3 weeks, Lamotrigine doesn‚Äôt really affect weight according to studies, as I‚Äôve read).

Also I take Choline - ~300mg, Multivitamins, B6 and Magnesium, fish oil, all not that regularly as I would‚Äôve wanted too, but more often than not, so almost every day. 

I don‚Äôt use drugs except for Marijuana and Alcohol, no stimulants except for two cups of coffee with sugar and milk per day.

I am not depressed right now or generally bummed, I feel real nice actually, although I experience stress right now because of family issues, I‚Äôm really mindful and I know which tools usually help me deal with stress, so I‚Äôm mostly calm and relaxed when I‚Äôm alone. 

The other month I had a problem when I could sleep up to 20 hours a day, or I could have a streak of sleeping up to >30 hours in two days. I would still feel very tired and weak physically when awake, so generally I would go back to sleep, I have attributed that to depression and even consider being hypersomniac, I have doubts about that now. 

Since last month or 3 weeks I‚Äôve been trying to fix my sleep schedule, now sleeping no more than 9 hours from ~12pm - ~9am, occasionally having 45 min - 3 hour naps midday, still feeling weak, just sleeping less and having less grogginess. I do have a brain fog and memory issues but I tent do attribute that to depression, right now I‚Äôm not depressed.

The other weird symptom that I have is feeling extremely hot even slightly active even being warm, up to beads of sweat falling from my forehead, upper body and arms, not armpits because I had Botox injections for supposed Hyperhidrosis. 
Yesterday I was forced to walk only in a T-shirt and unzipped hoodie in 12 degrees by Celsius because I was dripping. 
I‚Äôm generally quite cold when at home, despite everyone else feeling okay with the room temperature, ~21-26 Celclius. 

I don‚Äôt look physically ill right now, though my dear grandma commented on the hollowing of my cheeks, I‚Äôve noticed it too.
I have some visible fat on my abdomen, arms and thighs, I don‚Äôt look sickly thin as of now. 

I don‚Äôt have recurring headaches, sharp abdominal pain, maybe some slight digestive issues, but generally they resolve by themselves within couple of days. 
I still feel weak physically, although I can walk up to 10000 steps if I force myself, but I will be sore and tired for a couple of days. In days when I‚Äôm active I often need to sit down to collect myself, I can‚Äôt stand for longer than ~25 minutes without feeling weak. 

I understand that I might‚Äôve slightly mess up the timeline, but I‚Äôm certain that it was still under 3 months. 
There might be days when I eat l, but I get extremely weak fast and eat anyways. 
There are days when I feel nauseous, have weak appetite, usually I will still force myself to eat. 

Would like to get some advice on to which specialist I can refer to and for which tests to ask for, thank you guys in advance ü•≤üíó

1o1hvn4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sortlist_Official/comments/1o1hvn4/why_local_seo_might_be_the_most_underrated_growth/,Why Local SEO Might Be the Most Underrated Growth Strategy for Small Businesses,"If your business serves a specific area, whether that‚Äôs a city, region, or even a neighborhood, **Local SEO** is one of the most cost-effective ways to get found by real customers near you. Yet many small and mid-sized businesses still overlook it.

Here‚Äôs why local SEO matters more than ever and how to make it work for you.

# 1. What makes Local SEO different

Unlike traditional SEO, which targets national or global search visibility, **local SEO focuses on connecting your business to people searching** ***nearby.***  
Examples:

* ‚Äúcoffee shop near me‚Äù
* ‚Äúplumber in Austin‚Äù
* ‚Äúbest real estate agents in Denver‚Äù

These local-intent searches are exploding, and they often lead to immediate purchases or visits.

# 2. The core benefits

**‚úÖ Increased visibility in local searches**  
Google‚Äôs ‚ÄúLocal Pack‚Äù, those top map listings, get a huge share of local clicks. Ranking there means high intent traffic.

**‚úÖ More foot traffic and calls**  
When your business shows up in ‚Äúnear me‚Äù results, users are often seconds away from contacting or visiting you.

**‚úÖ Better reputation and trust**  
Optimized Google Business Profiles with reviews and accurate info make you look credible and approachable.

**‚úÖ Competitive advantage**  
Many small businesses still don‚Äôt optimize for local SEO, meaning the bar for ranking is lower compared to national SEO.

# 3. Key elements of a strong local SEO strategy

* **Google Business Profile:** Claim and optimize it with accurate hours, location, and images.
* **NAP consistency:** Make sure your Name, Address, and Phone Number match everywhere online.
* **Local keywords:** Include your city or area naturally in page titles, meta descriptions, and content.
* **Reviews:** Encourage happy customers to leave reviews, and respond to all of them.
* **Localized content:** Blog about local events, partnerships, or community stories.

# 4. The bottom line

Local SEO is one of the few marketing channels where small businesses can *genuinely compete* with larger brands. It drives real, measurable results, from foot traffic to phone calls, without the high ad spend.

**TL;DR:**  
Local SEO helps your business show up when nearby customers are searching. Optimize your Google Business Profile, keep your info consistent, use local keywords, and earn reviews, it‚Äôs one of the smartest moves for small business growth.",1,1759946456.0,Sortlist_Official,0,1.0,False

1o1hugz,https://www.reddit.com/r/InsulinResistance/comments/1o1hugz/its_possible_homair_score_from_12_to_3_in_a_year/,It's possible! Homa-IR score from 12 to 3 in a year.,"Hello everyone. I do not use social media that often and this account is a throw-away account for stuff like these. So I'll delete this post after a while, probably. Also English isn't my native language, I kindly apologize for any mistake.

I discovered I have insulin resistance not that long ago, though I was aware that I was having serious problems about my blood sugar levels (sudden drops etc.) and my weight for a long time.

I am (was!) a chocolate addict. The first thing I used to do after waking up was rushing to kitchen and eating chocolate spread with bread. I ate TOO MUCH. Morning, evening, literally every time. Everyday. A chocolate image would pop up in my brain and I would rush and eat chocolate. I've became overweight and still couldn't stop. Then blood sugar levels obviously lost it's balance. My blood sugar level would drop immediately almost every week. Sometimes every day without exception.

The horrible thing is I ate chocolate spread alongside bread, spoons of sugar with coffee and tea, chocolate bars, wafer and tons of more harmful stuff. And yes, almost, almost EVERY. DAY.

It went like that for a while (like 3-4 years.) and got progressively worse every year.

And then after some research about how chocolate (particularly sugar) affects our body, specifically our little friend pancreas and how we actually hurt our body, my mindset changed.

Those were the most powerful motivation I've ever felt. I realized I was LITERALLY torturing my body. My body, literally my best friend, who worked non-stop since I was born, that lives with me every day, every minute, every second was tortured by ME just for the sake of some serotonin and dopamine.

I was never ever paying this non-stop hard work back to it. No exercise. As I said, kilograms of chocolate probably almost every week. I was torturing my body. I was torturing my pancreas, my brain, every organ of mine with my weight.

I genuinely felt really, really sad. Like really. Mindset is REALLY important almost everywhere and this mindset transformed me into like a different person. It feels really weird and good at the same time. Every time I've craved sugar this mindset kicked me so hard that I stopped immediately. Never went to kitchen.

I can proudly say that I've lost 5-6% percent of my body weight. Last time I've ever tasted chocolate spread was over a month ago, almost no wafer except some exceptional days (only visits, almost. and still ate considerably low compared to old me), I've reduced my sugar a lot and nowadays drink my tea and coffee with considerably less sugar, I almost ate no chocolate bar except a few days ago which tasted horrible and never touched it again.

My HOMA-IR score is down to 3. I forgot when was the last time I've ever experienced sudden blood sugar drop. My body is happy, I am happy. Just that mindset, being friend with your body instead of torturing it, made me an insanely happy person. Now I'll hopefully start exercising regularly. Because I've just realized how much energy exercising gives me, it's almost crazy.

I'm still an overweight but going down really healthily and happily, and so close to losing that tag.

I want to say, I had absolutely no hope and thought I would go on like my old self forever. It's not true. That's a lie our sad tortured brain believes.

My body is now my best friend, not enemy. I love it, it gives its love back by energy and happiness. I hope everyone of you here can succeed. Have a lovely day and please, please be friend with your body. It's not your enemy and works really hard without a wage everyday!

**Edit: I slowly reduced and balanced my diet starting last year but real progress was taken in the last 2-3 months. You can actually see really great differences in a few months. Please never give up, we're the same, it gets easier more you are patient. HOMA-IR score 3 is still above the limit but I will hopefully go down further!**",1,1759946393.0,InsulinResistance,1,0.67,False

""Just a bit more, It's finally here. Today the device will activate, today the world changes forever, and there's no one that can stop me, not even *him*.""

My mind buzzed with excitement as I muttered a monologue to myself, a habit I picked up since I began my work.

For fifteen long years I had fought, struggled, and schemed, and today was the day that the system, the people, the world, would finally topple down.

*Social media is abuzz with posts and discussions of the alleged doomsday clock lowered into time square will reach zero today. The mayor has released a statement...*

*I don't even know how bad this doomsday would even be, I get through Monday, Tuesday, even Thursday every week, doomsday don't matter to me...*

*The city sits in fear as they wait for a sighting of Dr Lee Johnson, better known as ""Market man"" to help us as the nefarious ""Faceless one's"" doomsday clock nears zero many say Dr. Johnson is the only one that can save t...*

The televisions in front store windows, and smart phones in frigid palms all blared with the sounds of reporters and commentaries into the cold morning air like they always did. As I walked by I could feel the city on edge, they clutched their coffees and their energy drinks with white knuckled fear as they guzzled them to get through the morning, clinging to their precious comforts like fools.


*7:00*

Once the clock hits zero all of this will unravel, this precious little society will have it's blanket ripped away and feel the frigid air on its loins.

The comfort these people cling to, their need for a schedule, to be told what's happening, their lusting for modesty, their fake smiles and full days, where they pop pills and watch screens to feel informed, to pretend they're happy will all come tumbling down.

The work of the faceless one will finally be complete.

*6:00*

But I know the Market man will try to stop me, if only I knew where he-

*Thud*

I looked down, my boot had connected with the side of one of the many homeless lining the street i walked through.

""Hey man"" the homeless man coughed.

""Not now!"" I snapped, when suddenly I felt a hand grab my ankle.

As I looked down and shook my foot in anger I couldnt believe my eyes.

""Lee is that you?"" I asked.

*Cough cough* ""Yes! And I finally caught you!"" *cough*

The man wheezed and hacked, the steam of his breath spurting into the frozen sunlight. He was dirty, dirtier than after our fight in the trash heap in '06, and covered in newspapers. A sign laid in front of him that said ""anything will do, please help"" next to a cup with a single dollar and some change in it.

""Lee, what happened to you, I was wondering why you hadn't tried to stop me, the countdown is almost over. You look terrible, I thought you were a doctor, aren't you a world renown scientist?""

*5:00*

""I am,"" the man said, not relaxing his grip. ""But *cough* the hero work keeps me busy, and you know how it is in this economy, not a lot of places hiring. *cough cough* I tried doing food delivery in-between incidents, but I couldn't make it work, the tips were terrible.""

""Don't you have super speed?"" I asked, still stunned by seeing my arch nemesis in such a pitiful condition.

""I do yeah, and strength, and smarts, *cough* but people really don't tip well, doesn't matter how fast you get it to them. And any *cough cough* job I applied to just said I was over qualified, *cough* PhD and all,"" he hacked. ""But none of that matters, today I do my duty and serve the people of this city from fear by stopping you!"" His grip tightened on my leg as he struggled to pull himself to his feet, I could barely feel a trace of his super strength, this man was sick, he was dying.

*4:00*

""Lee..."" I said, my eyes starting to burn with sadness as I saw what had become of my nemesis, this upholder of the status quo. ""Look around Lee, look at yourself, you can barely stand...""

I guestered to the street around us, people shuffling like zombies from one job to another. Homeless people laying on grates and running from cops with nowhere else to go but jail. Parades of fancy vehicles and security surrounding those who had it all, keeping the beggars at bay as they shuttled them between penthouses and board rooms. People with their faces stuffed into their phones, terrified.

""... Something has to change Lee,"" I continued, ""it can't go on like this.""

""But *cough cough* they are scared of you, can't you see *cough* that you're terrifying them?"" The ailing hero said as he followed my gaze at the street around us before his knee suddenly began to give out.

I slipped an arm under him, catching him before he hit the pavement, pulling him, and holding him up under his shoulders.

""Lee, I know they're scared, but that doesn't mean this is right.""

*3:00*

""You are the strongest, fastest, smartest man on the planet, and you can't even keep a job, you can't even keep a roof over your head. How is your average person supposed to thrive? They can barely survive. The people might be scared, but that's because they are comfortable in their pain, they are exhausted, it's terrifying to imagine anything different, even if it would be better.""

For the first time since I met him Doctor Lee Johnson, the Market man, said nothing.

And the two of us stood and watched the people, and as we saw their faces, their tired eyes and weary smiles, both of us, the Market man and the Faceless one, began to shed tears.

*2:00*

""It's going to be okay Lee,"" I said to my sworn enemy.

""*Cough cough* you don't know *cough* that.""

""I do Lee, I do, my plan will work, the people will be free of this, I've been trying for so long, and today, for the first time you won't stop me."" I let out a chuckle in-between my muffled sobs.

""But the reports, *cough* you're the bad guy..."" Lee said as he gasped for air.

""Yeah, that's what they say..."" I muttered under my breath.

*1:00*

The two of us stood, in the symphony of the city street, surrounded by the pain of the people and the blaring sounds of TV's and smart phones. And we watched as the tired people shook with terror as they stared at their screens in unison, as the live stream of the clock neared it's end.

*Is this the end as we know it? How will you keep your family sa...*

*Hold your loved ones folks...*

*...there's no way any of us will...*

The TV's and phones blared as the seconds ticked, and Lee and I gathered ourselves as we waited for the dawning of a new age.


*0:00*

The clock flashed for a moment on the stream before being replaced by darkness, as in an instant all of the screens shut down. The TVs and the phones and the radios all came to a halt.

My plan had worked.

And for the first time in a long time, the people stood, staring at nothing, in the sound of silence.",1,1759946366.0,stories,0,1.0,False

I started taking generic Adderall IR about 8 months ago and increased my dose around 2 months ago after experimenting with dosage a bit (with approval from my prescriber) for around a month before that. I almost always only take my meds on workdays, meaning I take 2-3 days off each week.
When I first started my initial dose, I had sleep issues despite cutting out caffeine, but then I got used to it, and I also figured out I needed to take my second dose no later than 1pm if possible. Eventually I added back caffeine, though I try to avoid large amounts in the afternoon.
I asked to experiment with an increased dose because I went through a several-week period where I didn't feel my initial dose was as effective as before. My experiment went well, and without sleep issues, even though I tried a higher dose than I'm on now for awhile. So I changed permanently to my current 25mg/day dose, and that has been good, for the most part.
However, lately I've noticed two things:
1. Increased sleep issues on days I take meds: not sleeping deeply, waking up in the middle of the night, etc.
2. On the weekends, when I don't take meds, feeling really fatigued and drowsy and just wanting to sleep a lot. This last Saturday, I woke up feeling alert, drank WAAAY more coffee than I normally would, and then got really sleepy for the rest of the day...took two naps and then went to bed early and got up late lol. And then napped through half of a 5 hr. drive on Sunday. I did do a lot of strenuous physical activity on both Friday and Saturday...but still usual for me to feel so tired. Moderate/high servings of caffeine do usually have the classic ADHD ""opposite"" effect like this on me, but only on days I don't take stimulants.
I have been tracking how I feel throughout my menstrual cycle carefully over the last couple of months, so I know for sure that plays into this too. I'm also wondering if I ought to really cut back on caffeine again on med days, and if I'd maybe be better off on a little lower dose, particularly at some times during my menstrual cycle? Despite my frequent med breaks, I think my brain might be on a little too long of a yo-yo.",1,1759946091.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

1o1hmhe,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1o1hmhe/the_night_shift_at_the_diner_pays_400_i_wish_id/,The night shift at the diner pays $400. I wish I'd asked why (Part 1),"Last week, I ran away from home.

At my age, moving out would probably be a more acceptable term. But if you knew anything about my home life, you‚Äôd understand that running away is the correct one.

Either way, that‚Äôs not important right now. What matters is that I left with only a backpack, the clothes on my back and one extra change, a few days‚Äô worth of food, my phone, and about a thousand dollars in savings, which I‚Äôd been quietly stealing from my parents over the past ten years.

And no plan whatsoever.

I hitchhiked to the nearest bus station and bought a ticket for the first bus leaving the state because I didn‚Äôt want to give my family enough time to realize that I was gone. When I arrived at my first destination, I took another bus. Then another. And another. Until, finally, I ended up in the middle of nowhere in a small town in Iowa with fewer than four hundred people and one rundown motel that, by some miracle, didn‚Äôt ask for an ID or a credit card.

Coming from an overly sheltered life, I had no idea how the real world worked. I still don‚Äôt. When I arrived, I thought a thousand dollars, now nine hundred and fifty after the bus fares, was a fortune. That illusion shattered the moment I had to pay for a full week in advance to make up for my lack of credentials.

I soon learned that freedom comes at a steep price, especially when you‚Äôre desperate. The man running the motel must‚Äôve sensed it, because on top of the three hundred dollars for the week, he charged me an extra hundred ‚Äúbecause you never know with these kids nowadays,‚Äù as he put it.

With only five hundred and fifty dollars left, I realized freedom was fleeting. I also realized I needed a job ‚Äî fast.

And to make matters worse, three days ago, my food finally ran out. So I had no choice but to go to the nearby diner.

I‚Äôd never been to a diner before. But from what I‚Äôd seen on TV, I could tell that this one looked quite normal: checkered floors, red vinyl chairs, a boombox, and a blonde woman behind the counter refilling a man‚Äôs cup with what I believed to be tomato juice from a coffee pitcher.

It was early in the night, and the place was full of people eating and chatting, but all of that came to a stop when I walled in. The tension buildup was instant. Every pair of eyes was turned to me, and the man at the counter even licked his lips like a child presented with a piece of cake.¬†

I retreated slightly into myself, wishing I could disappear, until the voice of the blonde woman broke the silence.¬†

‚ÄúWelcome, dear,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúSit down anywhere. I‚Äôll be with you in a minute.‚Äù

I did what she said and glanced at the menu, trying to make sense of it. With items like ‚Äòbloody scramble‚Äô, and ‚Äòorgan platter,‚Äô its was hard to find anything that sounded remotely normal, or affordable. My eyes skimmed past ‚Äòheart skewers‚Äô and ‚Äòraw oysters,‚Äô before finally landing on the beef stew, which seemed like a safe choice.¬†

The waitress, Linda, approached me with a notepad in hand looking so exhausted that she looked like she was starting to blur a bit at the edges. ¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôd order soon if I were you, darling,‚Äù she said, rubbing her temple. ‚ÄúMy night girl just quit, and I‚Äôve already worked a double. We‚Äôre closing early tonight.‚Äù

I perked up at that.¬†

‚ÄúOh no, that‚Äôs horrible!‚Äù I exclaimed, trying to sound sympathetic. ‚ÄúDoes that mean you‚Äôre looking for someone to cover the night shift?‚Äù I asked, forcing a sweet smile.

The woman could see straight through my act, though. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt the job for you, dear. Trust me.‚Äù She muttered, a flash of worry in her eyes. ‚ÄúNow, can I get you anything, or not?‚Äù

‚ÄúI can do it,‚Äù I insisted. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve worked night shift at a diner before.‚Äù I smiled, and I hoped she wouldn‚Äôt see past my lie.¬†

She narrowed her eyes and glanced back at the clock behind the counter, and finally sighed in surrender. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre serious, you‚Äôd save me a massive headache with my boss. Fine. You can stay. I‚Äôll show you the ropes before I leave‚Äîbut this is just a trial, understand?‚Äù Her tone softened slightly, guilt creeping in.

I nodded eagerly, already half-standing.

She shook her head. ‚ÄúYou can still eat first, darling. Your shift doesn‚Äôt start till eight.‚Äù

And just like that, I had a job, temporary as it might be.

After dinner, Linda took me to the back, where I met Roger, the cook.¬†

Maybe I should‚Äôve turned around then and there, but I believed Roger to be just a quirky man at first. And, as it may be obvious, I was also in dire need of a job.¬†

As soon as I walked into the cramped kitchen, the man stopped cooking. He stopped breathing. In fact, he stood deathly still for what felt like an eternity. It wasn‚Äôt until Linda introduced us to each other that Roger turned around.¬†

I forced a smile despite how uncomfortable the interaction had made me feel, and I waved with an expression I hoped came off as friendly.¬†

He didn‚Äôt wave back though. Instead, he stepped closer to me and began sniffing the air around me. I tried to get away from him, but Linda anticipated my actions and smacked the man on the back of the head.¬†

‚ÄúRoger! Is that how you treat new coworkers?‚Äù Linda chided.¬†

He stumbled back, rubbing the back of his head. When he wasn‚Äôt sniffing me and acting like a pervert, he looked like a perfectly normal man in his late twenties. He didn‚Äôt say anything for a few seconds, and neither did I, but at least he had the decency to look apologetic.¬†

Linda sighed. ‚ÄúRoger, boy. Aren‚Äôt you going to apologize to Susan?‚Äù

‚ÄúSorry!‚Äù He exclaimed immediately, and the innocence with which he did it made me feel bad for him. He almost looked like a kicked puppy. ‚ÄúBut‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúNow,‚Äù the woman interrupted. ‚ÄúAs I was saying before you started being rude. This is Susan, and she will be working the night shift with you tonight. Keep an eye on her, alright dear?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, ma‚Äôam,‚Äù he nodded.¬†

‚ÄúGood. Now come on, darling. I‚Äôve got a uniform for you,‚Äù she said to me.

I did as she commanded. Linda led me to a small storage room located at the very end of the kitchen, and handed me a faded pink dress and a white apron with ruffles.

I put them on, feeling ridiculous, but the worst part was the hat. I couldn‚Äôt help but think that I looked a lot like a waitress from a cartoon.¬†

Still, as I caught my reflection in the small cracked mirror, I couldn‚Äôt help the faint smile tugging at my lips. For the first time, I felt like I was doing something on my own. Earning something. It felt like triumph.¬†

That brief spark of pride lasted exactly three minutes, though.

Out in the diner, the man who‚Äôd stared at me earlier tapped his cup against the counter in a crass attempt to get Linda‚Äôs attention.¬†

She sighed and reached for a pitcher, the one she was holding when I came in earlier. She bagan pouring the thick red liquid that at first glance I believed to be tomato juice. But now, standing close enough to smell the hot liquid, I caught the unmistakable metallic stench of blood.¬†

My throat went dry.

‚ÄúThis part‚Äôs easy, darling‚Äù Linda said in her usual cheery tone, as if she were teaching me how to brew coffee. She set the pitcher down on a heated rack beside five others I hadn‚Äôt noticed before. ‚ÄúYou have to keep the pitchers on the warmer. Nobody likes room temperature blood. But do make sure it doesn‚Äôt get over 100 degrees. It starts tasting foul not too long after that. Now, they go in order: A+, A-, B+, B-, O+, O-, and if someone asks for AB, just do half and half. Easy, right?‚Äù

She turned and smiled at me, waiting for a response.

I just stared. ‚ÄúYou‚Äîyou‚Äôre kidding, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, dear, you‚Äôll get the hang of it.‚Äù She moved on to the pastry shelf, still speaking like nothing was wrong. ‚ÄúWe keep the blood bags in the back. Just pour a new one in when you run out. The type‚Äôs labeled, so you won‚Äôt mix them up.‚Äù

My stomach lurched, and the air suddenly felt too thick to breathe.

*What did I get myself into?* I thought, backing away under the amused gaze of the rude man at the counter.

Linda kept talking, her back still to me. ‚ÄúNow, all the pastries are labeled, so you just hand the right one to the customer, and since you said that you have experience I‚Äôm sure you can handle taking orders. Everything else works just like at any other din‚Äî‚Äù She turned around mid-sentence and stopped when she saw me edging toward the door.

For a moment, something like disappointment flickered across her face. Then she smiled again, softer now, almost pitying.

‚ÄúYou can walk out that door right now, Susan dear. I‚Äôm not keeping you here against your will,‚Äù she said, her voice calm. ‚ÄúBut when you agreed to work here tonight, a promise was made. And we take promises very seriously.‚Äù

The sweetness in her tone soured into something sharp. ‚ÄúSo you can stay and finish your shift, or you can leave and pray that nobody here heard you break your word.‚Äù

My hands started shaking, and the man‚Äînot a man?‚Äîat the counter was still looking at me like he was about to burst laughing any minute now.¬†

Linda placed her hands gently on my shoulders. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be safe here, as long as you do what you said you‚Äôd do, darling.‚Äù She smiled kindly again, and that felt like the most unsettling part of all.¬†

‚ÄúNow‚Äî‚Äù she glanced at the clock, which marked eight o‚Äôclock‚Äî‚ÄúI have to go. I can‚Äôt stay in this plane any longer, but I hope to see you when I come to relieve you at four.‚Äù

I blinked, not understanding.

She gave me a quick hug, then her edges began to blur again, followed by the rest of her until there was nothing left at all.

I stifled a scream, my head whipping around to see if anyone else had noticed that the woman standing in front of me had just disappeared. But, of course, everybody else was only focused on their own meals and their own conversations, paying no attention to what I now assumed to be a completely normal and usual occurrence.¬†

However, there was one person who was not minding their own business. The rude man at the counter, whose grin only widened even further when he felt my alarmed gaze.¬†

‚ÄúAre you on the menu too, sweetheart?‚Äù He purred, barking a laugh at the sheer terror on my face. I felt my insides liquify for a second, and for a moment I my body became paralyzed with fear. The stranger rolled his eyes. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs no fun when you just freeze‚Äî‚Äú¬† he pouted. ‚ÄúJust get me another cup of O-. And do hurry up.‚Äù

I shuddered, but still did what he told me.¬†

My hands trembled as I reached for the pitcher. It felt warm in my hands, but that still did nothing to ease the shaking. I made my best effort not to look at the contents or even gag at the stench, as now that I knew what it really was it made my stomach churn uncontrollably.¬†

I focused solely on pouring the drink. Somehow, miraculously, not a single drop spilled.¬†

He snatched it off the counter before I could even set the pitcher down. The motion was so fast that it made me flinch, and the pitcher slipped from my hands. It shattered against the floor, splashing a deep, ugly crimson across the pristine white of my shoes.

I took a deep breath and stifled yet another scream.¬†

‚ÄúAlways so jumpy,‚Äù The man mocked. ‚ÄúTo your last‚Äî‚Äù He paused, chuckling. ‚ÄúSorry. To your¬†first¬†night.‚Äù He raised his glass in a mock toast and drained it in one long gulp.

I couldn‚Äôt stop staring at my shoes, and the deep red stain blooming across the floor.¬†

He tossed a stack of crumpled one-dollar bills onto the counter and stood. ‚ÄúGotta go. See you later, Bloody.‚Äù He grinned again, winking. But this time, he made sure that I could see the unnaturally elongated canines sitting in his mouth. Making a show out of it just for his own amusement.¬†

When I finally dared to look up again, Roger was standing beside me with a mop and broom. I hadn‚Äôt even heard him come in.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt mind him. He‚Äôs always an asshole.‚Äù He gave me a light pat on the back, and I flinched so hard the mop handle clattered against the counter.

By then, I‚Äôd already realized that none of these people were human. The thought of one of them touching me made every nerve in my body recoil. The word predator echoed through my mind, over and over.

His expression softened and he took one step back. At least he didn‚Äôt seem offended‚Äîor pleased like the vampire ¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ok. Just go change. I‚Äôll clean up here.‚Äù

I managed a shaky nod and stumbled toward the back room. Inside, I found another uniform in the same closet where I‚Äôd seen Linda go before. I changed quickly, though my fingers wouldn‚Äôt stop trembling, and by the time I worked up the courage to return, the floor was spotless, the air heavy with bleach, and Roger was calmly filling a new pitcher of O-.

‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù I managed to say, my voice barely a whisper. I was still terrified of the cook, but a part of me was profoundly relieved not to be alone. Also, he hadn‚Äôt really done anything to warrant my terror just yet.

Besides, we all know the saying. Better the devil you know than the angel you don‚Äôt. Not that I really knew Roger though.¬†

He glanced up to meet my gaze and gave me a small, reassuring smile. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll get used to this in no time,‚Äù he said.

I wasn‚Äôt sure how confident I was in his statement, though. But I nodded regardless.

Still, as the night wore on, I did fall into a rhythm. A customer would come in, I‚Äôd take their order, and I‚Äôd try not to think too much about what they were. At first, I tried to guess based on what they ordered, but I quickly realized it was better not to know. It was better to treat them as If they were just human customers in a normal human diner.¬†

Not that it was easy. Especially when I found out that ‚Äòheart skewers‚Äô meant literal raw hearts on a skewer. At least they were squirrel hearts and not human. Still made me gag.¬†

By the time three a.m. came and nothing disastrous had happened, I started to relax. The end was finally in sight. Just one more hour, I told myself. One more hour, and I‚Äôd walk out of this nightmare.¬†

But fate had other plans.¬†

A few minutes before four, a new vampire walked in through the door. It was impossible to deny what he was while he was flashing those canines.¬†

‚ÄúI thought this place would be closed tonight. I would‚Äôve come earlier if I knew it wasn‚Äôt.‚Äù He said, a smug expression on his face. Then his eyes landed on me. ‚ÄúWell, well, well. What do we have here? A last-minute snack? Linda has more tricks up her sleeve than I imagined. 

He took a step forward, but from the kitchen doorway came a low, warning growl. Suddenly, Roger grabbed me by the shoulder and shoved me into the kitchen.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not welcome here.‚Äù He kept growling, claws emerging from his nails. ‚ÄúAnd you already know that.

He threw his hands up. ‚ÄúOh, come on!‚Äù He exclaimed. ‚ÄúShe made a promise and then she broke it. You should really learn some things from me, wolfie. Promises are everything‚Äînot that you would know much about that. Now, just pour me a cup of AB+ and I‚Äôll be on my way. Come on. I won‚Äôt even eat the new girl unless she lets me‚Äù He flashed me a teethed grin, making me shudder.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs quite enough, Silas.‚Äù

Linda stood by the blood station, having simply¬†appeared. I didn't have the energy to even flinch at it. ‚ÄúYou know the rules. You prey on my staff, you lose your dining privileges. Permanently.‚Äù

The vampire, Silas, took a step back, his hands raised. ‚ÄúThe last girl on night shift broke a promise, Linda. We all know how that goes,‚Äù he shrugged. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs quite simple, really‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúIt never is with you.‚Äù Her voice was flat. ‚ÄúOut. You and your kind are not very keen on consequences except for when they benefit you. Now they benefit me. Out right now.‚Äù

With a venomous glare Silas turned and went back out the door, slamming it against the frame.¬†

Linda‚Äôs shoulders slumped, the immense power draining from her as she turned to me. ‚ÄúGood job, dear. See? I would you it would be just fine.‚Äù She smiled with that sweet smile from before. ‚ÄúYou did well. For a first night.‚Äù

‚ÄúCan I go now?‚Äù I whispered, desperate to get out of there.¬†

‚ÄúSure, dear. Don‚Äôt you want to stay for breakfast, though?‚Äù

No. I didn‚Äôt. I didn‚Äôt need to be told twice. I didn‚Äôt even respond to her question. I just took the apron off and I ran out the door, intending to get my things and leave the dammed town behind. I didn‚Äôt even think about payment or how I would live after that. Only about survival.¬†

I was running so fast, my lungs burning in the cold air, that I didn't realize I wasn't alone until I hit a solid wall. Or what felt like a solid wall.

It was Silas.

His hands shot out, gripping my upper arms forcefully in order to hold me in place with effortless strength. I tried to struggle against his grip, but he was too strong.¬†

""Leaving so soon?"" he purred, his voice a mockery of concern. ""And without serving me my AB+? That's terribly poor form for a waitress.

I tried to struggle again, but it was like trying to move stone. ""Let me go!""

""Tsk-tsk,"" he chided, his face inches from mine.

""We need to have a little chat about promises. You see, when you agreed to work the night shift at the diner, you entered into a spoken contract. An implicit promise to serve¬†all¬†the customers who walked through that door.‚Äù He began walking, forcing me backward with him, steering me effortlessly away from the main road and into the deep shadows between two darkened buildings.

""You might recall,"" he continued, ""that I politely placed an order. And you refused to fulfill it.‚Äù He smiled maniacally. ‚ÄúYou broke a promise and I am happy to make you pay for it.‚Äù

My back hit the cold brick wall of the alley. There was nowhere left to go. I remember having the distinct certainty that I was going to die without ever having lived a day in my life.¬†

""So you see, my dear,"" Silas whispered, one cold hand coming up to cradle my jaw, his thumb stroking my throat. ""This isn't malice. This is simply accountability. A balancing of the scales. You owe us all debt, even if the losers at the diner don‚Äôt see it the same way I do.‚Äù

He pulled back just enough to look into my eyes, his own gleaming with a horrifying delight. He was savoring this, drawing out every second of my terror.

""Any last words?"" he asked. His gaze dropped to the pulse hammering in my neck, and his canines began to elongate.

A screech erupted from my throat as blinding pain exploded in my neck. I tried to push him off me. I knew that I was going to die, but I wasn‚Äôt about to make it easy for him.¬†

I started to feel weak, drained. He was drinking from me in large gulps, all of which sent a wave of pain down my whole body. Then the pain got worse.¬†

Not because he became more forceful, but because he was torn off my neck. I could barely see through the tears. It was still dark and the haze brought on by pain, fear, and weakness made me believe that I was hallucinating. But it was real.¬†

Somebody‚Äîsomething‚Äîhad slammed Silas‚Äô body off mine, and they were fighting. I couldn‚Äôt see who was winning, or even who my savior was. Was it Roger? Linda?

It didn‚Äôt take long for me to find all of that out, because dawn was on the horizon. Through the first rays of sunlight of the day I could see the rude vampire from earlier pinning Silas to the ground.¬†

He lost his grip for a second, and Silas took that as an opportunity to leap back to me, shoving his fangs once more into my flesh, this time on my leg. The other vampire grabbed Silas again, tearing him off me and leaving me with an open wound from halfway up my calf to almost the top of my ankle.¬†

‚ÄúSire‚Äî‚Äù Silas started, but the rude customer picked him up by the collar and slammed him back to the ground. ‚ÄúI thought we‚Äôd discussed this, Silas. You weren‚Äôt supposed to draw more attention to us like this. Especially not after last night!‚Äù He roared. Silas tried to speak again, but his words died in his throat and were instead replaced by a screech of pain when his right arm was torn off the socket.¬†

I made a sound of pure terror, trying unsuccessfully to melt into the wall behind me. Unable to get up and run for my life.¬†

The man still standing placed a foot on Silas‚Äô chest, and methodically started pulling at his left leg. Slowly and torturously until it also came off the vampire whining in agony. I couldn‚Äôt keep looking, too busy vomiting every last ounce of substance in my body. I closed my eyes, praying that death would take me before the rude customer could get to me himself.¬†

One more ripping sound followed by a scream let me know that his other leg had also come off. And finally, a second ripping sound followed by no noise. Only then I dared to open my eyes, and I was greeted by the sight of torn off limbs and a decapitated torso.¬†

I wanted to scream, but instead came out a pitying sound that I can‚Äôt even describe.¬†

Then his eyes turned to me.¬†

He took a single, slow step toward me and his shoes made a squelching sound in all the blood, both from mine and Silas‚Äô.

I made another pitiful, strangled noise. A sound I didn‚Äôt even know I could make. There was nowhere to run, and this vampire had proven to be worse than the last one. I briefly wished Silas had been the one to kill me‚Äîat least dismemberment hadn‚Äôt seemed to be a part of his modus operandi. But now I was trapped with the much more terrifying one. The vampire that sparked fear even in his own kind.¬†

He walks even closer, stopping right in front of my paralyzed body. His eyes started tracing the bloody mess Silas had made of my neck and leg. I kept crying as he wordlessly reached over to Silas‚Äôs body and wet his hands in his blood before smearing it on both wounds.¬†

A wave of shock coursed through me as the long gashes faded into smaller bite wounds, still bleeding and still painful, but nos as grave as before.¬†

A slow, dark smile spread on his face. ""Looks like you really are on the menu after all, Bloody,‚Äù he said, and then he laughed. His fangs elongated as well, and I began whimpering again. But I didn‚Äôt have any more strength left to fight back.¬†

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry,‚Äù he purred. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to bleed you dry. That would be‚Ä¶ wasteful. And now you owe me for saving your life. I plan on cashing in that debt in the future.‚Äù

He grabbed me by my hair and pulled my neck towards his mouth, lowering until his fangs tickled my raw flesh.¬†

‚ÄúNo. Please‚Ä¶‚Äù I whimpered.¬†

‚ÄúShhh‚Ä¶‚Äù he whispered against my neck, sending a shiver down my spine.¬†

He slowly pushed the fangs in, holding me steady with an iron clad grip. It hurt, a lot. But it wasn‚Äôt as forceful or as bad as Silas‚Äô bite. Still I screamed, but it didn‚Äôt help ease the pain.¬†

Soon after a fog took over my mind and I must‚Äôve passed out because the next thing I knew was that I woke up lying on the coarse carped of my motel room. In horrible pain and after over twenty four hours since my shift at the diner ended.¬†

My neck and my leg were bandaged, and that realization brought all the memories from that alley back like a tsunami.¬†

Through labored breathing, I got up and opened the door to the motel, intending to flee town as soon as possible. But my exit route was blocked.¬†

Sitting neatly on the worn welcome mat was a small cardboard box. On top of it lay a plain white envelope. I snatched it inside, and I locked the door again.

The envelope was heavy and when I opened it it contained four one hundred dollar bills and a note.¬†

*Dear Susan,*

*Roger went to see you this morning to give you your pay for last night, but he found you wounded on the floor.*

*He cleaned your wounds and I made him bring you some food for later. You‚Äôre going to need it. I hope the chicken soup helps you feel better.*¬†

*PD. If you still want the job, come by the diner whenever you want. I do still need a new night shift girl.¬† The pay remains the same, four hundred dollars per night.* ¬†

*Love, Linda.*¬†

I stared at the money for a good few minutes before putting it with the rest. I made 400 dollars in one night.¬†

I‚Äôm more calm now, and I was able to think my escape plan through.¬†

The next bus out of town won‚Äôt be here for a few more days, and I definitely can‚Äôt escape on foot. This town is too far away from civilization.¬†

I still don‚Äôt know what Im going to do. For now I plan on staying in this room until I can actually leave. Roger has come over a few times, always with food from the diner, but I didn‚Äôt acknowledge him even once.¬†

All I want is to put this nightmare behind me.¬†

Especially the strange vampire that saved me. He says I owe him now, but I don‚Äôt think that I want to know what owing a vampire anything means. Maybe if I run, he won‚Äôt find me.¬†

I‚Äôm writing this as a warning for every single one of you out there.¬†

If you ever find yourself in a town in the middle of nowhere, do not go to the diner.¬†

And definitely don‚Äôt make promises you can‚Äôt keep.¬†",3,1759945918.0,nosleep,2,1.0,False

Then love-bombed, manipulated, lied to, cheated on, manipulated, lied to, love bombed, and abandoned.","It's been 7 months since you abandoned me hours after love-boming me, Jazmyn. You were my first everything. We were friends for 1.5 years, we lived together for 14 months, you knew I was terrified to get in a relationships. I opened up to about shit nobody knows, not even my own family. I let you closer than anyone has ever been to me, and you tortured me, fucked with my head, and the abandoned me at a time when it would hurt the most. Now I know there is true evil in this world. I've spent the last 7 months in fucking AGONY. I don't even have a sex drive anymore. I quite honestly want to fucking end it all, but I'm too pussy. I even convince myself at times that I deserved all of this. I wrote you fucking apologies and everything. I lost everything because of you. My life was fine before you. It wasn't great, but it was fine. Now, all my mental health problems are 50x worse and Ive tried to commit unalive twice. Fuck you. How do you sleep at night?

Here's the story of my first and last relationship. It's not at detailed as it should be because I had to have chatgpt type it while I tried to talk about it through my microphone without losing control of all my emotions.



I was single my whole life until I was 24. Because of significant childhood trauma, abandonment issues, social anxiety, and depression, I had always been afraid of women and relationships. I‚Äôd never really opened up to anyone or allowed myself to be loved. Then I met Jazmyn ‚Äî and everything changed.

We met at a gas station where we both worked. From the moment I met her, we had a real connection. We laughed, talked constantly, and grew extremely close during the year we worked together. But the entire time, she had a boyfriend. She constantly talked bad about him ‚Äî said he didn‚Äôt treat her right, that he was toxic, lazy, mean, or selfish. I always told her, ‚ÄúYou need to talk to him about this. Try to fix it. Work things out.‚Äù

One day, she said she wanted to leave him but didn‚Äôt know if she should. I told her that I didn‚Äôt feel right giving her relationship advice anymore, and that‚Äôs when I finally admitted that I had feelings for her. The second I said that, she lit up. She was so happy. Right then and there, she called her boyfriend and dumped him over the phone. He sounded shocked ‚Äî blindsided, really ‚Äî and she cried for maybe ten minutes, but after that she never mentioned him again.

From that day on, she was all about me. She started love bombing me right away ‚Äî constant messages, endless affection, sending long videos and slideshows about us, saying ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù within weeks. She told me she wanted to get married, buy a house, grow old together, have kids, the whole fairytale. She said every guy she‚Äôd ever been with was abusive, every ex was terrible, her family was cruel, and that I was the only one who ever saw her for who she truly was.

For a while, things felt amazing. But as time went on, especially near the end of the year, I started noticing changes. She began to pull away emotionally. Whenever I tried to have deep conversations, she‚Äôd brush it off and say, ‚ÄúEverything‚Äôs fine, everything‚Äôs perfect.‚Äù It started to feel fake ‚Äî like she was just saying what I wanted to hear.

By November or December, she had completely changed. She barely talked to me. She didn‚Äôt want to play games, watch movies, or go anywhere with me. She was constantly glued to her phone ‚Äî and even though she used to go through my phone every day, I never cared because I had nothing to hide. But now, she started hiding hers from me.

One day, I noticed she kept tilting her screen away whenever I looked over. When I asked what she was doing, she freaked out. That‚Äôs when I found out she‚Äôd been using AI chatbots ‚Äî apps where she was having simulated emotional or sexual conversations with artificial characters. It felt like emotional cheating. When I asked if something was wrong, she denied everything. I tried to talk about it calmly ‚Äî asked if she was unhappy or needed space ‚Äî but she kept reassuring me everything was ‚Äúperfect‚Äù and that she loved me.

By late December, her behavior got worse. She was distant, cold, glued to her phone constantly. Still, I bought her a bunch of Christmas gifts, and she acted overjoyed. She told me I was ‚Äúthe best boyfriend ever‚Äù and showered me with affection again for a bit. But not long after, she was back to hiding her phone.

In January, one night we were in bed, and she was sitting against the wall, facing away from me, typing on her phone. I asked to see it ‚Äî for the first time ever. She immediately panicked, started crying, and said it was a ‚Äúbreach of privacy.‚Äù I reminded her that she had gone through my phone countless times. I said I didn‚Äôt want to invade her privacy, but now it was obvious she was hiding something.

After more arguing, she finally admitted she‚Äôd been texting and Snapchatting a guy from work. She had never mentioned him before ‚Äî not once. They had a month-long Snapchat streak, meaning they‚Äôd been talking every day since early December. Who knows what they said or sent, since everything disappears on Snapchat, but I know she sent him intimate photos.

I was crushed. I never yelled or cursed ‚Äî I just sat there, devastated. She cried for a few minutes, said she was sorry, claimed he was ‚Äújust a friend,‚Äù and promised she deleted him. She swore everything was fine, told me she loved me, and that I had nothing to worry about. But deep down, something broke in me.

Around that time, I lost my job because I was too depressed to get out of bed. The weird part is, she seemed excited about it. She literally said, ‚ÄúWell, at least this makes things more interesting.‚Äù That hurt more than I can explain. I kept asking if she was unhappy, if she wanted to leave, if there was something wrong, and she just kept saying everything was ‚Äúperfect.‚Äù

By February, right around our first-year anniversary, we were talking one morning about how much we loved each other. She told me she couldn‚Äôt wait to come home from work because she had a surprise for me. She sent me Zillow listings for houses and said she wanted to spend the rest of her life with me. It felt like things might finally be getting better.

That same night, she came home from work, looked me in the eyes, and said, ‚ÄúWe need to talk.‚Äù Those were the first words she‚Äôd ever used to start a serious conversation in our whole relationship. Then she said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm leaving you.‚Äù

Just hours earlier, she had been love bombing me ‚Äî talking about marriage, kids, and forever. I was completely blindsided. We never fought, never screamed at each other. It made no sense.

I begged her to talk to me, to tell me what went wrong, but she just said she was ‚Äútired of my problems‚Äù and ‚Äúsick of me.‚Äù Eventually, I broke down. I shouted, ‚ÄúFine, get the fuck out!‚Äù and slammed the door, then locked myself in the bathroom and collapsed on the floor. I screamed and cried for over an hour. It was the worst pain I‚Äôd ever felt in my life.

After she left, I blew up her phone begging for answers. She ignored everything. I opened the laptop I bought her, and the last thing open was her Facebook Messenger. I saw that she‚Äôd been telling people lies about me ‚Äî saying I was abusive, manipulative, even claiming she was afraid I‚Äôd do something with her dead brother‚Äôs ashes, which was absolutely insane.

Worse, the first message she sent after leaving me was to that same coworker:

> ‚ÄúHey, we can finally talk again. I left him.‚Äù



That broke me all over again. I lost control. I messaged people on her Facebook trying to explain that I wasn‚Äôt a monster, that I loved her, that none of what she said was true. I know it just made me look crazy, but I was desperate to defend myself. She had built an entire false narrative while I was still trying to figure out what happened.

Since that night, she‚Äôs never spoken a single word to me. Seven months have passed, and it‚Äôs like I never existed. She blocked me, erased me, moved on. A couple months later, she was already in another relationship ‚Äî again, with a coworker.

The same exact pattern she had before me: talk bad about her boyfriend, cheat with a coworker, and then vanish without remorse.

Looking back, I think she started emotionally detaching and building her exit plan months before she left ‚Äî around November or December ‚Äî while manipulating me into thinking everything was fine. She mirrored my emotions, made me feel safe, and then discarded me without closure.

I know I wasn‚Äôt perfect. I struggled with depression, anxiety, and isolation. I wasn‚Äôt going out enough. But I was trying. I had even made a plan to start therapy for her, because she convinced me that all of our problems were my fault. I realize now that I was taking responsibility for everything while she took none.

I loved her deeply. I cooked for her, cleaned, packed her lunches, made her coffee, bought her gifts, took her on dates, listened, tried to make her feel loved and safe. And in return, she lied, cheated, manipulated, and left me like I never mattered.

After everything, I think she never truly loved me ‚Äî not the real me, anyway. She loved the attention, the validation, the control. I believe she has serious emotional or psychological issues ‚Äî maybe narcissistic traits or trauma of her own ‚Äî but she refused to ever look inward or take accountability.

So now, I‚Äôm left trying to heal from my first love, my first heartbreak, and the realization that the person I fell for might have never even existed. It‚Äôs the most painful thing I‚Äôve ever experienced ‚Äî but it‚Äôs also taught me a lot about boundaries, manipulation, and self-worth.",2,1759945874.0,ExNoContact,1,1.0,False

1o1hlf7,https://i.redd.it/69k7qhplextf1.jpeg,Hawas Black + A few decants,"Recent pickups + first impressions (Hawas Black, Khamrah Qawah, 9pm Elixir, Turathi Electric, Hawas Ice)

So I picked up a few new fragrances recently:

Hawas Black (100ml, Dec 2024 batch)

Khamrah Qawah (decant)

Turathi Electric (decant)

Hawas Ice (decant)

9pm Elixir (decant)


Here are my early impressions after a few wears:

Hawas Black (2024 batch)
At first I couldn‚Äôt pick up the notes properly because I‚Äôd already smelled a few other scents, so I reset with coffee and tried again. The second try was a lot better. It opens citrusy and spicy, and there‚Äôs definitely that CDNIM kind of vibe, fresh yet with a peppery, aromatic kick. It has that clean-shower-gel DNA but with a bit more bite. Feels a lot better after a few hours, it's sillage is great as well. But I probably won't buy a full bottle again.

Khamrah Qawah
Too sweet for my taste. It‚Äôs one of those heavy, syrupy gourmands, leans more on the sweet-spicy side than the coffee-spice I expected. Not unpleasant, but it‚Äôs the kind of scent I‚Äôd get tired of quickly. Maybe better suited for colder weather or if you love dessert-like fragrances.
Not my vibe.

Hawas Ice
Honestly, felt quite close to the regular Hawas. Maybe a touch fresher or cleaner up top, but I didn‚Äôt notice a dramatic difference. It‚Äôs still that same mass-pleasing fruity-aquatic DNA, but personally I'd pick it up over the regular hawas.

9pm Elixir
This one‚Äôs a surprise. It tones down that bubblegummy sweetness from the OG and replaces it with something deeper and smoother. Stronger presence, slightly darker, and more wearable overall. Feels like a more refined, night-out version of the original 9pm. 

Turathi Electric
This one‚Äôs tricky to describe. It opens sharp and aromatic, with a kind of green, metallic vibe. There‚Äôs a freshness but also a dense, slightly synthetic layer that gives it some punch. It‚Äôs bold, clean, and different from the usual Middle Eastern sweetness you‚Äôd expect. Still figuring out whether I like it or not, but it‚Äôs definitely interesting.

PS. I'm pretty new to fragrances so trying the hyped ones for now. 
Also shoutout to Malkeet Paaji (Guru Nanak Traders) for the fragrances.

Coffee tasted off, and even boiled water had this odd chlorine aftertaste. This model from Waterdrop promised cleaner, better-tasting water with easy maintenance, so giving it a shot was a no-brainer. Here's how it really fared, from installation to daily use and‚Äîeven more importantly‚Äîwhether it lives up to the hype.

**Smooth and straightforward installation experience**

Installing this under-sink water filter was simpler than I initially imagined. I mean, there‚Äôs no denying I‚Äôm not exactly someone who can confidently call themselves ‚Äúhandy,‚Äù but the instructions were clear enough that I managed on my own. It only took about thirty minutes, tops. What struck me was how it didn‚Äôt require a separate faucet‚Äîdefinitely a bonus for folks who don‚Äôt want to clutter their kitchen sinks further. It connects to the cold water valve and integrates with the main tap seamlessly. For a product boasting such sleek engineering, the installation process made it accessible to even less technically inclined people like myself.

**Taste improvement: Did it deliver?**

Once installed, the difference in water quality was immediately noticeable, and not just to me. My partner, who loves brewed tea, mentioned how the change in water clarity made her tea taste better. According to its description, this filter reduces chlorine and improves odor, and after consistently using it, I can vouch for that claim. There was no trace of that annoying chlorine tang, and the water tasted cleaner overall. However, a significant caveat is that this filter doesn‚Äôt reduce Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), so don‚Äôt expect that ultra-soft water some filtration systems provide.

**Solid construction and reliable materials**

One of the things that stood out was the quality of the materials used. The unit itself feels robust. It‚Äôs BPA-free, lead-free, and certified by IAPMO against NSF/ANSI 372 standards, so safety doesn‚Äôt seem compromised. Even after a few months of daily use, it didn‚Äôt show degradation, nor did I encounter any leaks‚Äîa small but important win when dealing with plumbing add-ons.

**Performance and flow rate: A closer look**

This water filter boasts a flow rate of 0.75 gallons per minute. To provide some context, it‚Äôs fast enough that it doesn‚Äôt disrupt your regular kitchen activities. From filling pasta pots to washing vegetables, the water stream remained consistent‚Äîthankfully without any frustrating sputtering. However, it connects only to the cold water valve, limiting its use solely to cold water applications. It worked fine for me, but this might be something to keep in mind if your water filtration needs extend beyond that.

**Benefits**

- Enhanced water taste by reducing chlorine content.  
- Straightforward installation without needing any professional help.  
- BPA-free and lead-free materials ensure safety.  
- Seamless integration with the existing water setup‚Äîno extra faucet required.  

**Areas of Concern**

- Doesn‚Äôt filter out Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), so the water may still have minerals.  
- Limited to cold water use, which could be restrictive for some.  

**Comparing it to other options out there**

When lined up against competitive products like the Brita Total360 undersink filter or the Culligan US-EZ-4, the Waterdrop WD-3US-PF01 shines with its ease of installation and its compact design. The Brita model offers comparable chlorine reduction but demands a bit more effort during setup due to its more complex system. The Culligan filter, while similarly priced, comes with a slightly bulkier housing, which might be an issue for under-sink space-constrained kitchens. However, TDS removal is an advantage for some Culligan options, which this particular Waterdrop lacks. It's small trade-offs like these that define the user experience, and in my case, simplicity won.

**Value Proposition**

In weighing the cost against the benefits, it became clear to me that this water filter is catering to a specific corner of the market. It's best suited for those who want an easy, cost-effective way to enhance the taste of their water without venturing into full-scale filtration systems with TDS removal. Its reliable materials and performance add to its overall appeal. For what it offers, it feels like a well-balanced choice in terms of product quality versus effort and expense. If you're someone who prefers smart spending, this strikes a good balance.

It did taste good but I noticed after every cup I felt off (I drink coffee every day and have tried countless brands). My blood pressure was up and I had a tightness in my neck. By the end of the night it subsided. I had another cup the next day and same thing. The next day, same thing. I emailed and asked if they did any testing for mold or toxins. No Response. I then tossed the bag and disputed with credit card company and they refunded.

Then I received this email from Matt at HappyMugCoffee where he said I stole from them and to be a better human. Even the credit card company was shocked. Here's his full email: ""Hi \_\_\_\_\_\_, One thing you might not have realized about us is that one of the ways we keep our prices low is because we don't let anyone steal from us. We just got notified that you are attempting to do a chargeback on your order, which is theft, because we fulfilled¬†your order as promised, and now you're trying to get out of paying. Since you never notified us of the chargeback, you will automatically lose. It will take two or three months for it to settle out, but the charge is going to go back onto your credit card bill in a few months. We have a very high percentage record of winning illegal chargebacks.

But the other thing is that we subscribe to an app that communicates with millions of other stores about customers who do illegal chargebacks, and now I have to report you, and you're going to get red flagged all over the place. When we get an order from a customer who gets flagged as having done illegal chargebacks from another store, we just cancel the¬†order and ban the customer. Several other companies behave the same way. In this day and age of shared data and technology, you can't get away with stealing online. You will get caught, you will get flagged, you will pay what you owed, you will get blacklisted.¬†

**Permissionless**: You can share your content freely‚Äîno need for approval or gatekeepers.

**Trust**: Every post is cryptographically signed, ensuring authenticity and credit always stay with you.

**Permanence**: Once published, your content is immutable and always available. Only you can update it.

https://preview.redd.it/z98zt9e5dxtf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b86c4d5858819ae096f04c7632f129bf1744bc7

[https://www.waivio.com/@grampo](https://www.waivio.com/@grampo)

These advantages are powerful, but there‚Äôs another, often overlooked transformation the blockchain brings:¬†**the free flow of information**.

In traditional social media, your content is fragmented between closed platforms.

If you want your message to reach your followers on Facebook, X, or LinkedIn, you have to repost it separately on each one, with reactions and comments scattered across these networks. Each platform keeps its own version of your post‚Äîisolated and disconnected from the rest.

**On the public blockchain, this changes completely.**¬†Your post is no longer limited to your profile on one app‚Äîit can appear across multiple apps, projects, and communities that draw from the same blockchain. In other words, your content is no longer trapped inside a closed network; it travels, connects, and grows across the entire open ecosystem of apps.

**Imagine sharing a story about your favorite caf√©.**¬†On the blockchain, that post can appear in many places beyond newsfeeds‚Äîin coffee-lover communities, caf√© maps, or local discovery projects. Suddenly, your story isn‚Äôt just for your followers‚Äîit‚Äôs part of a broader ecosystem of apps and projects, where other users can discover and like your content. Those likes aren‚Äôt just digital applause‚Äî**on the social blockchain, they translate into real earnings.**

And once you share your favorite Peach Cobbler recipe, it could be recognized by a cooking-loving community and even added to a collection of their recipes. This gives your content continuous exposure, expands your social reach, and brings you new followers. More people see it, more engagement flows your way, and each interaction helps you earn visibility and rewards directly through the blockchain.

1o1hgwx,https://i.redd.it/cl2iyp14dxtf1.png,Tyler's character inspiration,"That is an excerpt from¬†**Chas Addams: A Cartoonist's Life**, the biography of the creator of the Addams cartoons, and by extension, the Addams Family.¬†

Charles Addams was an avid reader who explored all kinds of genres, from the classics to the contemporary. He was also a meticulous man who loved documenting everything in his diary, including the books he read. In¬†**A Cartoonist's Life**, his biographer Linda H. Davis highlights a particular diary entry to show that Chas Addams was a complex, multi-faceted man, one whose interests went far beyond the grotesque and macabre he was best known for.

**He read. ""Unlike many cartoonists,"" commented Chip McGrath, ""Charles Addams actually read the magazine."" He liked humor writer Veronica Geng; he knew historical trivia. He apparently read an Anne Tyler novel. (""Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant ‚ÄîTyler,"" he wrote in his 1982 datebook.)**

To summarise briefly,¬†**Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant**¬†by Anne Tyler explores the effects of parental neglect and dysfunctional family relationships. It follows three children abandoned by their father and estranged from their emotionally distant mother‚Äîeach developing distinct temperaments shaped by that trauma. Cody, the eldest son, struggles most with anger, self-doubt, and resentment.

I've always felt that the Wednesday series was a love letter to Charles Addams. It has a certain quality that sets it apart from other adaptations, likely because it weaves inspiration from the creator's personal life and the mythologies surrounding him. If Chas Addams were alive today, I believe this series would appeal deeply to his sensibilities beyond the cartoons themselves.

Based on clues from Charles Addams's biography and Brendan Gill's 1975¬†*New Yorker*¬†profile, I think Tyler's character in Wednesday was written to reflect another side of Addams‚Äîhis personality, his experiences, even fragments of his relationships. Tyler's moments with Wednesday mirror moments from Addams's own life:

**1. The Weathervane Cafe**¬†‚Äì Charles began drawing cartoons for his school's literary magazine,¬†**The Weather Vane**, at sixteen, where he served as art director. Later, when he became a household name at¬†*The New Yorker*, he was a regular at an elite social club in New York called¬†**The Coffee House**. In Wednesday, 16-year-old Tyler Galpin works as a barista at the Weathervane, a coffeehouse where Wednesday often spends her time.

**2. The Crypt Date**¬†‚Äì Charles Addams often went on picnic dates with his third wife, Tee, in cemeteries.

**The couple picnicked in cemeteries and enjoyed the dogs. -\*from A Cartoonist's Life, page 302**

3.¬†**Legally Blonde -**¬†Of all the rom-coms Tyler could've picked to watch as a ""horror movie"" with Wednesday, Legally Blonde feels deliberate. The story of Elle Woods strikingly resembles Charles Addams's second wife, Barbara Barb.

Descriptions of Barbara from the book:

* ""People were astonished to learn that this woman with the movie-star hair, tiny waist, and long black gloves was a practicing lawyer. Poured into a tight skirt and an expensive, low-cut blouse with French cuffs, Barbara Barb suggested Hollywood's idea of a woman lawyer.""
* ""Specializing in international law ‚Äîan unusual choice for private practice in those days, noted Nancy Wechsler.""
* ""When she wasn't jetting off to Europe on business, she spent her time swimming, riding, playing tennis, drawing skillful courtroom sketches she called ""legal satire,"" and writing a prospective book titled ""Murder In Law,"" an apparent reference to her own youthful victories in the criminal courts.""
* ""After graduation she set up a solo practice at 675 Gates Avenue in Brooklyn at her mothers residence, where she had grown up.""
* ""Spooky, that woman,"" was Lyda Hall's terse assessment of the new Barbara. If Addams heard any of this chatter from the flock of pretty girls Barbara posed with on his porch at Westhampton Beach ‚Äîall smiles and summer shorts ‚Äîit seemed to have no effect on him. He was utterly captivated. ""Charlie just absolutely adored her,"" said Therese Milstein.""
* ""Charles Addams is now mixed up with a woman lawyer who bites him and is said to be handy with a knife when she's mad,"" James Thurber wrote his daughter, Rosemary, on October 4, 1954.""
* ""It was noted that ""the glamorous barrister"" would ""continue to represent her ex-husband, cartoonist Charles Addams.""

1. **Willow Hill**¬†\- Charles was once admitted to Lenox Hill Hospital; he married Tee on a hill where a willow tree stood.

**Barbara had found a doctor and arranged for him to meet Charlie at Lenox Hill Hospital. -from page 298**

**It stood on the Burdett's Creek side of the house, where they had been married, and where there was a willow tree. -from page 264**

\---

**Possible reasons why Tyler is a Hyde**

1. During World War II, Charles was drafted and worked at Army's Signal Corps Photographic Center (SCPC).

***Addams was assigned to Unit A, which included several World War I artists, paid as civilians. Among the regular soldiers were Clarence John Laughlin, a well-known New Orleans photographer who became a good friend; Gerry Davis, who later produced The Odd Couple on tele vision; the boyish Stan Lee, who would become a writer and co-creator of The Amazing Spider-Man\^ The Incredible Hulk, and other Marvel Comics superheroes -***¬†**from page 72**

The SCPC was located in the old Paramount studio at Thirty-fifth Avenue and Thirty-fifth Street in Astoria.

**Here the Marx Brothers had filmed Animal Crackers and The Cocoanuts; John Barrymore had starred in Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. -\*from page 71**

2.¬†**""the monster that is in all of us.""**¬†Of all the mythological figures Charles Addams drew, his favourite was the Minotaur‚Äîa creature symbolising duality, punished simply for existing as both man and beast, for possessing a nature beyond his control.

***""semibovemque virum semivirumque bovem""***¬†**(""Half-bull man and half-man bull""), a line describing the Minotaur from Ovid's**¬†***Ars Armatoria)***

*Seneca, Phaedra 687 ff :*

**""Thy monster-bearing mother \[Pasiphae\] . . . She did but pollute herself with her shameful lust, and yet her offspring by its two-shaped infamy \[the Minotaur\] displayed her crime, though long concealed, and by his fierce visage the hybrid child made clear his mother's guilt.""**

**Addams was asked about his some what ""romantic, nostalgic"" takes on such mythological figures as the Minotaur in the labyrinth. Addams drew the Minotaur not as the fear some creature of mythology, drawn on a shattered cliffby Gustave Dore, but as a two-legged beast leaning dreamily against the wall of a modern art gallery or a rat's maze, or lurking in an information booth, his face more reflective than menacing. ""Well, I find him sweet and human and the way everyone wants his own particular Minotaur to be,"" Addams told Philip French. In the Minotaur, he found ""the monster that is in all of us."" - from page 153**

In Season 2, Episode 5, during the Outcast Remembrance Day parade, a float carries two ancient Outcasts, the Cyclops and the Minotaur, through a sea of cloaked figures. Then Tyler steps in, hidden beneath the same robes.

Barbara Barb (the second wife) had peculiar pet names for Addams, including ""Dearest Porker Bell"", ""Porker"", and ""My Monstre"".

**Writing in her typical motherly style, Barbara urged Addams to take care of himself and watch his drinking. While claiming to rejoice in his happiness as a popular bachelor, she missed him, she said. He was still her ""Porker Bell,"" her ""Zoe Porker""; she was still his ""Monstre."" -from page 146**

3. During his lifetime, fans and critics spread rumours that Charles Addams suffered mental breakdowns whenever he created his most famous works, so severe that¬†*The New Yorker*¬†supposedly called an ambulance to take him to a sanitarium.

**""I used to hear it as an estabUshed fact from members of the cult, none of whom had ever met Charlie, that whenever he reached the point of derangement at which he began to sketch again one of the most famous of his drawings ‚Äî that of a skier who has just skied through the trunk of a tree, the tracks of his skis uninterrupted on either side of the trunk and the skier himself miraculously intact ‚Äî the office would summon an ambulance and have Charlie hurried off to a sanitarium."" Brendan Gill,**¬†***Here at the New Yorker (1975), page 222***

>""They said that Addams would have periodic mental breakdowns and begin drawing the gruesome maternity room cartoon."" Linda H. Davis, Chas Addams: A Cartoonist's Life, page 3

\---

**The following is a prediction/speculation for season 3:**

I suspect Wednesday's obsession with murder mysteries and sleuthing stems from two influences:

1. Edgar Allan Poe invented the modern detective story, and
2. During the Great Depression, Charles Addams worked as a part-timer at True Detective around the same time Bonnie and Clyde started their two-year crime spree (1932-1934) involving bank robberies, gas station heists, and auto theft across several states.

**Hired at $15 a week, ""terrible"" money even during ""the nadir of the Depression,"" said Addams, he did lettering, diagrammed crime scenes re-creating ""how the murderer moved about the room,"" drew ""the X where the body was found,"" and painted the blood out of some of the grislier police shots that ran with the stories ‚Äîan exercise that might be compared to blotting stains from a suit of clothes with benzene. It re quired skill rather than talent. Addams personally liked the pictures the way they were, ""with just a tad more blood and gore,"" he said. - from page 38**

**It was the era captured in a flashbulb. Here were the glory days ofor ganized crime and mythical figures such as Al ""Scarface"" Capone and Lucky Luciano. Sinister figures in pearl-gray homburgs cruised the city streets in big Packards.¬†Bonnie and Clyde, John Dillinger and his gang, tore around the dirt roads of the Midwest, robbing banks and bumping offanyone who got in their way. -from page 39**

**""We're two black-hearted souls ready to pillage the world together.""**¬†I have reasons to believe this is foreshadowing. Tyler used the word ""pillage"".

*Pillage (noun):*

***to steal something from a place or a person by using violence, especially during war.***  
*from Cambridge Dictionary*

***1: the act of looting or plundering especially in war***  
***2: something taken as booty***  
*from Merriam-Webster Dictionary*

1o1hfis,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1o1hfis/wedding_morning_location_dilemma/,Wedding morning location dilemma!,"Hi all! Trying to figure out the best option for getting ready on the day of, and curious to hear thoughts from other brides. Myself, two bridesmaids, my mom & MIL will be getting our hair and makeup done (I am paying for all their services as a gift to each of them). Our wedding is at a bed & breakfast venue that we‚Äôll be staying at the night of the wedding with immediate family & bridal party, but we are not able to stay the night before. Venue is 1 hour away from our house, and both of our families live out of town so will be travelling in the day before and require overnight accommodations. Our bridal party lives in the same city as us. Check in to the bridal suite is at 12:00 pm, and all other guest suites is 2:00pm. Our ceremony is set to start at 4:30pm, and we‚Äôre planning to do a first look & family/bridal party photos before at the venue (beginning around 2:45). The groom & groomsmen will be getting ready at our house and driving to the venue, to arrive by 2:00pm.

¬†

Option A ‚Äì get ready at hair salon that is 30 mins from our house & 30 mins from venue. The hair stylist we‚Äôve booked offers both on-site and in-salon services. If we opt for their salon, we have exclusive access to the premises, and our makeup artist is welcome to provide services there at the same time. We receive a 20% discount on our hair services for not travelling. Hair is currently booked for 10-12:30 with 2 stylists for 5 people, to be adjusted once makeup is booked. Makeup is looking like it‚Äôll need to be 7:00-12:30 with 1 artist, so we all would need to leave for the salon by 6:30 am (if they even can accommodate a 7:00 am start as their typical opening time is 9:00 am). We would then travel 30 minutes from the salon to the venue for arrival by 1:30pm to get dressed & ready for first look and photos. Parents would need to rent 2 hotel rooms nearby.

Option B ‚Äì rent Airbnb 2 minutes from venue for the night before and pay extra to have a 2:00pm checkout (this would then take the Airbnb ‚Äúoff the market‚Äù for the night of the wedding). My parents, MIL, bridesmaids & myself would stay here the night before. Groom would stay the night at our house (possibly with his brother). Hair and makeup would perform services here between 8:00-1:00, and we would then drive (literally down the street lol) to the venue to get dressed & ready for first look and photos.

¬†

Option B seems like it would be a more relaxing morning as there‚Äôs less driving around, and makeup could start an hour later. It is the more expensive option, though ‚Äì close to $1000 to rent the Airbnb with late checkout, and it would increase our hair & makeup costs by roughly $450 for travel & on-site service fees. There are also only a few Airbnb's & 1 hotel in the village we‚Äôre getting married in, so I do worry about ‚Äútaking‚Äù an option off the market for the wedding night for other family members who may be looking for somewhere to stay. ¬†I feel no type of way about staying with my fianc√© the night before or not, but I was looking forward to sleeping in my own bed the night before & having coffee with him in the morning.



Which option would you pick? Part of me feels like it‚Äôs a no-brainer for option B, but I feel like I‚Äôm just spending SO MUCH MONEY already lol.",1,1759945501.0,weddingplanning,2,1.0,False

My name is Hunter Gordon. I am a Home Care Aide who has lived in Redmond my whole life and I plan on running as a Democrat for the US House against Suzan DelBene.

I am making this post for two reasons. First, as I am just starting out my campaign, I am looking for recommendations of **places to host small gatherings to connect with the community where they are**. (For example, someone on r/redmond suggested Soul Food Coffee. As this is Kirkland, I am looking for places within your local area as well.) Second, I want to hear from you about **what you would want from our national representatives**. Ultimately, I want this to be a campaign ran by and representing us, the people, and not rich oligarchs who have pervaded our political system, buying out Congress to serve their wishes.

Thank you for your time!

# What I stand for

I believe WA-1 deserves a fighter against this Trump administration and one who stands up for the working class. With my parents buying our home before the big tech boom and resulting housing prices, the idea of us buying the place now would be completely out of the question. Now, the question for many isn't ""How will I buy a home?"" but ""How can I pay my rent?"". It has been [over 15 years since the federal minimum wage was raised to $7.25 an hour](https://www.npr.org/2024/07/24/nx-s1-5050573/federal-minimum-wage-increase-15-year-anniversary) (it's currently [$16.66 an hour for Washington state](https://www.lni.wa.gov/workers-rights/wages/minimum-wage/)). With technology advancements resulting in higher productivity, we **should** see that result in higher wages for workers, but instead, it gets funneled to shareholders and the ultra-wealthy who ultimately hoard that wealth. With all that hoarded money not going back into the economy, that serves to hurt small businesses as a whole. We need a significant raise to the minimum wage, tying it to productivity and inflation, as well as massive wealth distribution from the rich to the rest of society. ([Wealth inequality is so bad at this point](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/wealth-inequality-billionaires-piketty-report/) that it is close to, if not worse, than what we saw during the Gilded Age.)

With that, big corporations need to be broken up. There's a term I often use called ""[enshittification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification)"" (coined by Cory Doctorow) that describes how online products and services decline in quality over time, with the degradation being due to market capture to maximize profits for shareholders. This degradation not only hurts the products at hand, but it can hurt the public as a whole, such as with Facebook, which [prioritized content to make users angry and disproportionately pushed out misinformation to users](https://thehill.com/changing-america/enrichment/arts-culture/578724-5-points-for-anger-1-for-a-like-how-facebooks/), all to get more engagement on the site.[ Microsoft as well has continued their layoffs throughout the company](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/microsoft/microsoft-layoffs-continue-into-5th-consecutive-month/), [raised Game Pass prices](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/01/microsoft-price-hike-xbox-game-pass-ultimate.html), and [scrapped Game Pass price discounts for all games and DLC](https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-confirms-it-scrapped-the-xbox-game-pass-discount-on-all-games-and-dlc-purchases-gives-subscribers-more-rewards-points-instead). While no general law of ""you can't make your services worse"" could be made, what makes these corporations able to do these sorts of actions is the lack of viable alternatives to many of their services. Facebook themselves [bought out much of their competition, including Instagram and WhatsApp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Meta_Platforms). Facebook is currently in an antitrust trial with the FTC, with the [FTC accusing Facebook of using a ""buy or bury"" strategy to keep smaller competitors at bay and maintain an illegal monopoly](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/04/15/why-facebook-zuckerberg-bought-instagram-antitrust-trial/83100070007/). People say competition spurs innovation; corporations being so big that they buy up all other competition is the opposite of that.

I also believe immigrants should have a path to citizenship. Right now, we have ICE terrorizing immigrant communities, making them scared to show up to work or to even be a part of the community. These are people who are trying to live their lives and support their families like you or I. With their work, buying from businesses and paying taxes, they help our communities and our economy. When they are indefinitely held in ICE detention facilities, the main people who profit are private prison corporations.

In terms of standing up against Trump, I will hammer the fact that Trump and elected Republicans are trying to stop the release of the Epstein files. I struggle to understand why Democrats aren't capitalizing off this idea, especially given that the Epstein files are brought up in nearly any discussion regarding the presidents actions. Anyone who abused children‚ÄîRepublican, Democrat, or independent‚Äîdeserves to be ostracized by society and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. When it comes down to it, elected Republicans are protecting p\*dophiles, plain and simple.

With as corrupt as elected Republicans are, I also plan on hammering how they just flat out don't care about the working class. There is no excuse to voting for tax cuts for the wealthy while so many of us are living paycheck to paycheck. And Democrats as well (albeit to a lesser extent) are taken in by wealthy interests, focusing more on how campaign donors can pad their bottom line than helping their constituents.

Those are a few policies that come to my mind for the moment. Feel free to ask me any questions if you have any!",6,1759945452.0,Kirkland,5,1.0,False

Gerry woke up on a Saturday morning six months after his promotion to digital technician at AT&T.
 
The transition from running a Xerox copier to private line tester had gone seamlessly. He and Steve had taken the classes, done the on-the-job training, and gotten lucky with their supervisor. Gary Mateo‚ÄîItalian, built like Geraldo Rivera, nicknamed ‚ÄúThe Wiz‚Äù for his ability to troubleshoot any circuit‚Äîhad taken a liking to both of them and put them under his wing.
 
They learned the art of loop-backing and running diagnostic tests on analog and digital data circuits. They got good at ringing and talking over voice circuits for everyone from Wall Street trading firms to mom-and-pop grocery stores with two phone lines.
 
But the technical stuff was only half the job. The other half could be just as challenging: remembering the customer was always right, even when some irate trader was screaming that you were personally costing him millions of dollars. Gerry learned pretty quickly that the best way to shut them up was to fix the damn circuit. Luckily, he had a knack for it.
 
Gary had passed the magic wand over their heads the week before, anointing them office-qualified digital technicians. That meant they could work solo now‚Äîovertime, weekends, the whole deal.
 
The money would make things easier for him and Mary, now that they were living together. The overtime and once-a-month weekend shifts alone covered the rent, so they could bank Mary‚Äôs entire paycheck. Neither of them said it out loud, but they both knew what they were saving for. A wedding. Eventually.
 
The older guys who‚Äôd trained them had become mentors and drinking buddies. Especially Sandy and Vinnie‚Äîboth family men, both potheads, both in their forties. Sandy was a Vietnam vet who‚Äôd been a helicopter gunner in the Army. He looked like a Puerto Rican Jimi Hendrix, complete with a pink bandanna hanging from his back pocket. While Sandy had been dodging bullets overseas, Vinnie had been dodging the draft at college, racking up four degrees and protesting to bring guys like Sandy home.
 
Now they worked side by side, and both loved their morning smoke sessions. Part of Gerry and Steve‚Äôs ‚Äútraining‚Äù involved getting high with them on fifteen-minute breaks.
 
Then there was Erl, the shop steward, and his best pal Wojo‚Äîanother Vietnam vet who walked with a limp. Gerry and Steve often speculated about how Wojo got wounded. Shrapnel from a grenade blast, probably. They were too afraid to ask.
 
And then there was Stevie Dead‚Äîshort for Brain Dead‚Äîprobably the most brilliant guy in the office. He‚Äôd even figured out how to hack into Verizon‚Äôs database to pull their engineering documents. Another regular at the morning pot breaks.
 
At 5:00; Gerry sometimes would meet Mary on the corner of Chambers and Hudson to ride the train home with her and Angie. It was funny how all that change had started feeling normal. Comfortable, even.
Somewhere between old and new.
 
Chapter Two- Riding the Line 
 
I glanced beside me and saw Mary was already up. It was 8 a.m., Saturday morning, a gray October chill creeping through the window, nudging out summer‚Äôs warmth.
 
That was fine by me‚Äîfootball season was in full swing, and our betting pool was off to a solid start. Danny was so deep into the Bears he‚Äôd bought a Walter Payton jersey, converting me into a part-time fan. I stayed loyal to the Giants but was raking in decent cash betting alongside him. Stein, stubborn as ever, bet the Jets every week and was hovering around .500‚Äîa jackpot for a mush like him.
 
I rolled out of bed, did a quick standing stretch, and shuffled into the kitchen. Mary had a pot of coffee brewing, pouring herself a steaming cup. She wore one of my white T-shirts as pajamas, her go-to sleepwear since we moved in together.
 
I gave her a quick kiss on the lips and fixed myself a bowl of Cheerios. The New York Post weekend edition, already fetched by Mary, sat on the counter.
 
I flipped to the sports section, scanning the college football betting lines. Last year, Audrey‚Äôs picks had us raking in cash, but I hadn‚Äôt talked to her much since the promotion, only bumping into her a couple of times with Andy or Dude.
 
She was high on Florida State last year and their new coach, Bobby Bowden. Four weeks into the season, they were 3-0 for us. Today, Florida State faced Temple, and my Fighting Irish were at Missouri‚Äîa solid parlay. I‚Äôd run it by Danny later and swing by Angelo‚Äôs to place the bets.
 
Since moving in with Mary, I‚Äôd capped my betting at weekends only, seventy five bucks max, unless I was playing with house money. 
 
Mary had even gotten into it, especially football. I loved watching games on our couch, her cheering beside me. She got extra affectionate after a win‚Äîa sweet bonus.
 
‚ÄúSo, who‚Äôve we got today? Florida State again?‚Äù Mary asked, leaning against the counter with her coffee.
 
‚ÄúYou know it,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúRiding them till they lose. Parlaying them with the Fighting Irish.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúPerfect,‚Äù she grinned. ‚ÄúYou know an Irish girl like me‚Äôs gotta root for Notre Dame.‚Äù
 
It was wild how football and betting talk got her fired up. Next thing I knew, we were back in the bedroom, breakfast half-eaten on the table, going at it like characters in a Harlequin romance.
 
We always hopped in the shower together after morning lovemaking. Moving in together was working out pretty damn well, I thought. Mary wasn‚Äôt the cook mom was, but she held her own, and the fooling around more than made up for it.
 
I threw on my sweats after the shower and headed out for my morning jog. I‚Äôd left my weights in my parents‚Äô basement, so push-ups and sit-ups had become my nightly routine. I‚Äôd lost some bulk, but with Mary in my life, who was I trying to impress? I chuckled at the thought.
 
The Seventeenth Avenue overpass, leading to the I footpath by the water, was just up the block. It was about a mile and a quarter to the Verrazzano Bridge, making for a solid two-and-a-half-mile round trip.
 
The wind whipped hard toward the bridge, sometimes stalling me like I was running in place. The ocean churned, choppy under a gray, slightly cloudy sky. The payoff came on the return, the wind at my back, pushing me like Sebastian Coe sprinting for Olympic gold.
 
The jog took about twenty minutes both ways. Back home, I found a note from Mary: she‚Äôd gone shopping at Pathmark on 86th Street and would be back in an hour.
 
By ten o‚Äôclock, after a warm shower, I called Danny. ‚ÄúIrish and Seminoles, Dan. That‚Äôs my parlay.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúMy Cousin Frankie says bet Tulsa‚Äîdon‚Äôt ask me who they‚Äôre playing, I got no clue,‚ÄùDanny said. 
 
‚ÄúTwenty-dollar parlay on Florida State and Notre Dame, we split fifty on Tulsa against whoever. That‚Äôs the play. I‚Äôll be right over,‚Äù I said.
 
Bath Avenue in my apartment was the new. I got in the car and headed up 16th Avenue to Danny‚Äôs. Once I parked on 66th Street, the old was just five minutes away.
 
Chapter Three: Handicapping the Past
 
I pulled up to the club, where Danny was already waiting. Five minutes later, Steinberg strolled in.
 
‚ÄúHey, Gerry,‚Äù Angelo said, grinning. ‚ÄúYou move in with a girl, and now I only see you on weekends? What‚Äôs with that bullshit? Forget my number?‚Äù
 
‚ÄúI got bills to pay now, Ang,‚Äù I shot back. ‚ÄúMaybe I‚Äôll cut it to once a month. How‚Äôd you like that?‚Äù
 
‚ÄúAlways wiseass answers from you guys,‚Äù Angelo grumbled from behind the table. ‚ÄúJust make your bets already.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúNotre Dame and Florida State, twenty four-dollar parlay,‚Äù Danny said. ‚ÄúPlus fifty straight up on Tulsa.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúWhat about you, Stein?‚Äù Angelo asked. ‚ÄúYour girl got you on a leash like Gerry‚Äôs?‚Äù
 
‚ÄúFifty on Florida State, Ang,‚Äù Stein said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a big fan of the girl‚Äôs picks.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúYo, she ain‚Äôt picking this year,‚Äù I cut in. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just riding Florida State from last season. Call it a holdover.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúGlad you finally took my advice and cut her off,‚Äù Danny said. ‚ÄúThat was a no-win deal with her.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúYesterday‚Äôs news,‚Äù I said, shrugging. ‚ÄúIf we‚Äôre done, I gotta swing by my parents‚Äô. Mom made chicken cutlets for us.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúYou guys crack me up,‚Äù Angelo said, shaking his head. ‚ÄúI was dodging mortar fire in Korea at eighteen. You pansies are still letting your mamas baby you.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúTwice a week‚Äôs all I can stomach of you, Ang,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúDanny, I‚Äôll call you tomorrow.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúWhat about me?‚Äù Stein piped up.
 
‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt consult you on bets,‚Äù Danny said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs bad enough you mooch our picks with your luck.‚Äù
 
When I walked into my folks‚Äô apartment, the chicken cutlets were waiting in a brown paper bag, wrapped in aluminum foil.
 
Pop sat at the kitchen table, playing solitaire, while Mom ran the sweeper over their bedroom carpet.
 
‚ÄúGerry!‚Äù they said in unison, their faces lighting up as they wrapped me in hugs and kisses.
 
‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Mary today?‚Äù Mom asked, setting a pot of espresso to brew.
 
‚ÄúPathmark, grocery shopping,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI was with Danny and Steinberg at the corner.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúHow‚Äôs work going?‚Äù Pop asked, laying down a card. Learn anything new?‚Äù
 
‚ÄúAlways,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúJust when you think you‚Äôve got it figured out, there‚Äôs more to learn. Gary, my supervisor, certified me office-qualified last week, so I can start pulling weekend shifts and overtime.‚Äù
 
Pop crossed himself, and Mom kissed the top of my head, placing a steaming demitasse of espresso in front of me. Just like old times.
 
We chatted a bit longer after I finished my coffee. Pop filled me in on the giant squash taking over his backyard garden.
 
I kissed them goodbye, grabbed the cutlets, and headed back to Mary. It still felt strange leaving my old house to go home.
 
When I got back to our Bath Avenue apartment, Mary was finishing unpacking the groceries.
 
‚ÄúChicken cutlets for lunch,‚Äù I said, grinning.
 
‚ÄúOh, good,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still getting used to hauling bags up three flights of stairs.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúKeeps us in shape,‚Äù I teased. ‚ÄúSaves us a gym membership.‚Äù We both laughed.
 
‚ÄúI talked to Angie earlier,‚Äù Mary said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre meeting her and Jeff at the Vegas Diner for dinner, then heading to Bay Ridge for drinks.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúI was just with Stein,‚Äù I said, wary. ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt mention anything.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúRight, like we need to clear our weekend plans with you guys,‚Äù she said, laughing as she slipped her arms around my neck and pulled me in for a kiss.
 
At noon, we heated the chicken cutlets. I slathered them with marinara sauce and sprinkled on grated Parmigiano cheese.
We made two and a half sandwiches each on Wonder Bread, settling in to watch Notre Dame dominate Missouri in the first half, up 21‚Äì7 at halftime. 
 
Every time the Fighting Irish scored, I tossed Mary onto the couch, and we made out like teens in a Cameron Crowe flick.
 
We won sixty bucks on the parlay, but Tulsa got crushed by Texas A&M, so Danny and I ended up thirty-five dollars ahead for the day. Steinberg, betting Florida State, pocketed fifty with their cover at Temple.
 
By six, we showered and got ready for dinner with Angie and Jeff. Since moving in together, we‚Äôd been hitting the town with them nearly every Saturday night.
 
Andre called, saying he and V would be at Mustard Seeds, a club on Ninety-Second Street and Third Avenue. Mary mentioned her sister Donna might show, maybe Angie‚Äôs cousin Michelle too.
 
So it was set: cheeseburger deluxes at the Vegas Diner, then drinks and dancing at Mustard Seeds. I could‚Äôve spent the whole night on the couch, watching college football and fooling around with Mary, but she wasn‚Äôt having it. Saturdays were for friends.
 
Chapter Four: The Mush Strikes Again 
 
After pocketing a win on Florida State over Temple, Steinberg couldn‚Äôt leave well enough alone. He called Angelo and let the full $110 ride on UCLA against Stanford in the late game.
 
While Angie primped for their night out with the gang, Stein slouched on the couch, Angie‚Äôs shih tzu, Lucy, curled in his lap. He watched Stanford‚Äôs QB, John Pave, carve up UCLA‚Äôs solid secondary with surgical precision, playing the game of his life.
 
UCLA, 3‚Äì1 going in, was a near lock against 1‚Äì3 Stanford. Every ABC pregame expert had picked the Bruins to cover big. What they couldn‚Äôt account for was the Steinberg mush‚Äîa jinx that, after his early Florida State win, reared its ugly head again.
 
With less than two minutes left, Stein stared at the clock ticking down, the announcer‚Äôs call drowned out by the whirrr of Angie‚Äôs hairdryer.
 
Angie stepped out of the bathroom in a tiny terrycloth robe, its belt lost in their move, giving Stein a glimpse of her bikini-model figure.
 
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong? You lost again?‚Äù she said, brushing her hair. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs written all over your face.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Stein sighed. ‚ÄúI was up $110 and let it ride on the late game. UCLA was a sure thing. How was I supposed to know Stanford‚Äôs lousy quarterback would turn into John Elway and have a career game?‚Äù
 
Angie plopped onto the couch beside him, the robe slipping off her shoulder. Lucy, sensing trouble, leapt from Jeff‚Äôs lap and ducked under the coffee table.
 
‚ÄúStarting tomorrow, you get fifty bucks to bet,‚Äù Angie said, her voice firm. ‚ÄúLose it, and you‚Äôre cut off. We‚Äôve got rent and bills, Jeffrey. You can‚Äôt blow our money on stupid bets. Got me?‚Äù
 
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not wrong,‚Äù Jeff said, sliding a hand around her waist and pulling her in for a kiss. ‚ÄúI should‚Äôve waited to bet with Danny and Gerry tomorrow. That was dumb.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù Angie laughed, pushing him back. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre getting ready to go out. I‚Äôm done in there‚Äîyour turn. Your new Barbara Dare tape came today. There‚Äôll be time for that later, Tiger.‚Äù
 
Angie slipped into a tight, black mini dress that turned heads without trying. Jeff took a quick shower, throwing on black jeans and a gray polo shirt. 
 
Punctuality was Angie‚Äôs thing, and they had to meet Gerry and Mary at the Vegas Diner by nine. She spread newspaper pages in the bathroom for Lucy‚Äôs accidents, then hustled Jeff out the door, his hair still damp as he ran a pocket comb through it.
 
Gerry and Mary were waiting out front when Jeff and Angie reached the Vegas Diner. Mary and Angie hugged like they hadn‚Äôt seen each other in months, though it was just yesterday.
 
The diner hummed with Saturday night chaos, but no waitlist. The manager grabbed four menus and led them to a corner booth, still damp from the busboy‚Äôs rag.
 
They slid in, Gerry and Mary facing the door. Outside, the evening was clear and crisp, about 58 degrees, a nudge that colder weather and steam heat were closing in.
 
‚ÄúYour friend‚Äôs cut off tomorrow, Gerry,‚Äù Angie said, pointing at Jeff. ‚ÄúNo more football bets.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúReally?‚Äù Gerry said, puzzled. ‚ÄúWhy? He did better than me and Danny. We‚Äôre up thirty-five bucks; he won a hundred ten on Florida State.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúTell him, Jeff,‚Äù Angie said, nudging him.
Jeff sighed. ‚ÄúYeah, I called Angelo. Watched the college scoreboard show‚Äîeveryone said UCLA would crush Stanford. Called it a lock.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúYou blew the whole thing?‚Äù Gerry asked, rubbing his chin.
 
‚ÄúIt was a lock,‚Äù Jeff said. ‚ÄúHow was I supposed to know Stanford‚Äôs quarterback would play like a Hall of Famer?‚Äù
 
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it,‚Äù Angie said, her eyes narrowing. ‚ÄúFifty-dollar cap on weekend bets from now on.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got a cap too, Jeff,‚Äù Mary said, smiling. ‚ÄúSeventy-five bucks, unless we win‚Äîthen it‚Äôs house money. I‚Äôm kinda into it now.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúYou should‚Äôve bet the fifty you won and kept the original fifty for tomorrow,‚Äù Gerry said. ‚ÄúNow you‚Äôre shut out.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúAnd don‚Äôt start that tab nonsense again, Jeff,‚Äù Angie groaned. ‚ÄúWe paid it off when we moved in together. I‚Äôll march down there and rip Angelo‚Äôs rug off myself.‚Äù
 
They all burst out laughing and ordered their food. When they were done, Mary, the group‚Äôs math whiz, split the check evenly, tip included. Gerry took it to the cashier, and they piled into their car, headed for Bay Ridge.
 
Angie, driving like she was outpacing Mario Andretti, snagged a parking spot right off the corner. Gerry, trailing behind, circled for five minutes before finding a space around the block.
 
Andre and V were already at the bar in Mustard Seeds. Gerry and Jeff squeezed in beside them, trading handshakes. Mary and Angie ducked into the ladies‚Äô room, promising to be right back.
 
Gerry and Jeff each tossed a twenty into the pile and ordered Bud Lights.
‚ÄúMiss riding the train to work together,‚Äù Andre said to Gerry, his voice cutting through Michael Jackson‚Äôs Thriller blasting from the speakers.

Mary and Angie returned, dragging Gerry and Jeff onto the dance floor. Mustard Seeds pulsed as a neighborhood hotspot, the night alive with dancing and chatter alongside Dre and V.
 
Angie and Jeff slipped out around one, swaying close to Journey‚Äôs Open Arms. Gerry and Mary stayed another hour, swapping work stories and reminiscing about factory nights with Andre and V.
 
They all said goodnight at two and headed out. Mary mentioned to her mom they‚Äôd come for Sunday dinner and spend the day. Gerry started the car, cranking the heat a touch for the first time since fall set in before heading home.

Gerry woke up on a Saturday morning six months after his promotion to digital technician at AT&T.
 
The transition from running a Xerox copier to private line tester had gone seamlessly. He and Steve had taken the classes, done the on-the-job training, and gotten lucky with their supervisor. Gary Mateo‚ÄîItalian, built like Geraldo Rivera, nicknamed ‚ÄúThe Wiz‚Äù for his ability to troubleshoot any circuit‚Äîhad taken a liking to both of them and put them under his wing.
 
They learned the art of loop-backing and running diagnostic tests on analog and digital data circuits. They got good at ringing and talking over voice circuits for everyone from Wall Street trading firms to mom-and-pop grocery stores with two phone lines.
 
But the technical stuff was only half the job. The other half could be just as challenging: remembering the customer was always right, even when some irate trader was screaming that you were personally costing him millions of dollars. Gerry learned pretty quickly that the best way to shut them up was to fix the damn circuit. Luckily, he had a knack for it.
 
Gary had passed the magic wand over their heads the week before, anointing them office-qualified digital technicians. That meant they could work solo now‚Äîovertime, weekends, the whole deal.
 
The money would make things easier for him and Mary, now that they were living together. The overtime and once-a-month weekend shifts alone covered the rent, so they could bank Mary‚Äôs entire paycheck. Neither of them said it out loud, but they both knew what they were saving for. A wedding. Eventually.
 
The older guys who‚Äôd trained them had become mentors and drinking buddies. Especially Sandy and Vinnie‚Äîboth family men, both potheads, both in their forties. Sandy was a Vietnam vet who‚Äôd been a helicopter gunner in the Army. He looked like a Puerto Rican Jimi Hendrix, complete with a pink bandanna hanging from his back pocket. While Sandy had been dodging bullets overseas, Vinnie had been dodging the draft at college, racking up four degrees and protesting to bring guys like Sandy home.
 
Now they worked side by side, and both loved their morning smoke sessions. Part of Gerry and Steve‚Äôs ‚Äútraining‚Äù involved getting high with them on fifteen-minute breaks.
 
Then there was Erl, the shop steward, and his best pal Wojo‚Äîanother Vietnam vet who walked with a limp. Gerry and Steve often speculated about how Wojo got wounded. Shrapnel from a grenade blast, probably. They were too afraid to ask.
 
And then there was Stevie Dead‚Äîshort for Brain Dead‚Äîprobably the most brilliant guy in the office. He‚Äôd even figured out how to hack into Verizon‚Äôs database to pull their engineering documents. Another regular at the morning pot breaks.
 
At 5:00; Gerry sometimes would meet Mary on the corner of Chambers and Hudson to ride the train home with her and Angie. It was funny how all that change had started feeling normal. Comfortable, even.
Somewhere between old and new.
 
Chapter Two- Riding the Line 
 
I glanced beside me and saw Mary was already up. It was 8 a.m., Saturday morning, a gray October chill creeping through the window, nudging out summer‚Äôs warmth.
 
That was fine by me‚Äîfootball season was in full swing, and our betting pool was off to a solid start. Danny was so deep into the Bears he‚Äôd bought a Walter Payton jersey, converting me into a part-time fan. I stayed loyal to the Giants but was raking in decent cash betting alongside him. Stein, stubborn as ever, bet the Jets every week and was hovering around .500‚Äîa jackpot for a mush like him.
 
I rolled out of bed, did a quick standing stretch, and shuffled into the kitchen. Mary had a pot of coffee brewing, pouring herself a steaming cup. She wore one of my white T-shirts as pajamas, her go-to sleepwear since we moved in together.
 
I gave her a quick kiss on the lips and fixed myself a bowl of Cheerios. The New York Post weekend edition, already fetched by Mary, sat on the counter.
 
I flipped to the sports section, scanning the college football betting lines. Last year, Audrey‚Äôs picks had us raking in cash, but I hadn‚Äôt talked to her much since the promotion, only bumping into her a couple of times with Andy or Dude.
 
She was high on Florida State last year and their new coach, Bobby Bowden. Four weeks into the season, they were 3-0 for us. Today, Florida State faced Temple, and my Fighting Irish were at Missouri‚Äîa solid parlay. I‚Äôd run it by Danny later and swing by Angelo‚Äôs to place the bets.
 
Since moving in with Mary, I‚Äôd capped my betting at weekends only, seventy five bucks max, unless I was playing with house money. 
 
Mary had even gotten into it, especially football. I loved watching games on our couch, her cheering beside me. She got extra affectionate after a win‚Äîa sweet bonus.
 
‚ÄúSo, who‚Äôve we got today? Florida State again?‚Äù Mary asked, leaning against the counter with her coffee.
 
‚ÄúYou know it,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúRiding them till they lose. Parlaying them with the Fighting Irish.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúPerfect,‚Äù she grinned. ‚ÄúYou know an Irish girl like me‚Äôs gotta root for Notre Dame.‚Äù
 
It was wild how football and betting talk got her fired up. Next thing I knew, we were back in the bedroom, breakfast half-eaten on the table, going at it like characters in a Harlequin romance.
 
We always hopped in the shower together after morning lovemaking. Moving in together was working out pretty damn well, I thought. Mary wasn‚Äôt the cook mom was, but she held her own, and the fooling around more than made up for it.
 
I threw on my sweats after the shower and headed out for my morning jog. I‚Äôd left my weights in my parents‚Äô basement, so push-ups and sit-ups had become my nightly routine. I‚Äôd lost some bulk, but with Mary in my life, who was I trying to impress? I chuckled at the thought.
 
The Seventeenth Avenue overpass, leading to the I footpath by the water, was just up the block. It was about a mile and a quarter to the Verrazzano Bridge, making for a solid two-and-a-half-mile round trip.
 
The wind whipped hard toward the bridge, sometimes stalling me like I was running in place. The ocean churned, choppy under a gray, slightly cloudy sky. The payoff came on the return, the wind at my back, pushing me like Sebastian Coe sprinting for Olympic gold.
 
The jog took about twenty minutes both ways. Back home, I found a note from Mary: she‚Äôd gone shopping at Pathmark on 86th Street and would be back in an hour.
 
By ten o‚Äôclock, after a warm shower, I called Danny. ‚ÄúIrish and Seminoles, Dan. That‚Äôs my parlay.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúMy Cousin Frankie says bet Tulsa‚Äîdon‚Äôt ask me who they‚Äôre playing, I got no clue,‚ÄùDanny said. 
 
‚ÄúTwenty-dollar parlay on Florida State and Notre Dame, we split fifty on Tulsa against whoever. That‚Äôs the play. I‚Äôll be right over,‚Äù I said.
 
Bath Avenue in my apartment was the new. I got in the car and headed up 16th Avenue to Danny‚Äôs. Once I parked on 66th Street, the old was just five minutes away.
 
Chapter Three: Handicapping the Past
 
I pulled up to the club, where Danny was already waiting. Five minutes later, Steinberg strolled in.
 
‚ÄúHey, Gerry,‚Äù Angelo said, grinning. ‚ÄúYou move in with a girl, and now I only see you on weekends? What‚Äôs with that bullshit? Forget my number?‚Äù
 
‚ÄúI got bills to pay now, Ang,‚Äù I shot back. ‚ÄúMaybe I‚Äôll cut it to once a month. How‚Äôd you like that?‚Äù
 
‚ÄúAlways wiseass answers from you guys,‚Äù Angelo grumbled from behind the table. ‚ÄúJust make your bets already.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúNotre Dame and Florida State, twenty four-dollar parlay,‚Äù Danny said. ‚ÄúPlus fifty straight up on Tulsa.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúWhat about you, Stein?‚Äù Angelo asked. ‚ÄúYour girl got you on a leash like Gerry‚Äôs?‚Äù
 
‚ÄúFifty on Florida State, Ang,‚Äù Stein said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a big fan of the girl‚Äôs picks.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúYo, she ain‚Äôt picking this year,‚Äù I cut in. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just riding Florida State from last season. Call it a holdover.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúGlad you finally took my advice and cut her off,‚Äù Danny said. ‚ÄúThat was a no-win deal with her.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúYesterday‚Äôs news,‚Äù I said, shrugging. ‚ÄúIf we‚Äôre done, I gotta swing by my parents‚Äô. Mom made chicken cutlets for us.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúYou guys crack me up,‚Äù Angelo said, shaking his head. ‚ÄúI was dodging mortar fire in Korea at eighteen. You pansies are still letting your mamas baby you.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúTwice a week‚Äôs all I can stomach of you, Ang,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúDanny, I‚Äôll call you tomorrow.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúWhat about me?‚Äù Stein piped up.
 
‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt consult you on bets,‚Äù Danny said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs bad enough you mooch our picks with your luck.‚Äù
 
When I walked into my folks‚Äô apartment, the chicken cutlets were waiting in a brown paper bag, wrapped in aluminum foil.
 
Pop sat at the kitchen table, playing solitaire, while Mom ran the sweeper over their bedroom carpet.
 
‚ÄúGerry!‚Äù they said in unison, their faces lighting up as they wrapped me in hugs and kisses.
 
‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Mary today?‚Äù Mom asked, setting a pot of espresso to brew.
 
‚ÄúPathmark, grocery shopping,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI was with Danny and Steinberg at the corner.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúHow‚Äôs work going?‚Äù Pop asked, laying down a card. Learn anything new?‚Äù
 
‚ÄúAlways,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúJust when you think you‚Äôve got it figured out, there‚Äôs more to learn. Gary, my supervisor, certified me office-qualified last week, so I can start pulling weekend shifts and overtime.‚Äù
 
Pop crossed himself, and Mom kissed the top of my head, placing a steaming demitasse of espresso in front of me. Just like old times.
 
We chatted a bit longer after I finished my coffee. Pop filled me in on the giant squash taking over his backyard garden.
 
I kissed them goodbye, grabbed the cutlets, and headed back to Mary. It still felt strange leaving my old house to go home.
 
When I got back to our Bath Avenue apartment, Mary was finishing unpacking the groceries.
 
‚ÄúChicken cutlets for lunch,‚Äù I said, grinning.
 
‚ÄúOh, good,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still getting used to hauling bags up three flights of stairs.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúKeeps us in shape,‚Äù I teased. ‚ÄúSaves us a gym membership.‚Äù We both laughed.
 
‚ÄúI talked to Angie earlier,‚Äù Mary said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre meeting her and Jeff at the Vegas Diner for dinner, then heading to Bay Ridge for drinks.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúI was just with Stein,‚Äù I said, wary. ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt mention anything.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúRight, like we need to clear our weekend plans with you guys,‚Äù she said, laughing as she slipped her arms around my neck and pulled me in for a kiss.
 
At noon, we heated the chicken cutlets. I slathered them with marinara sauce and sprinkled on grated Parmigiano cheese.
We made two and a half sandwiches each on Wonder Bread, settling in to watch Notre Dame dominate Missouri in the first half, up 21‚Äì7 at halftime. 
 
Every time the Fighting Irish scored, I tossed Mary onto the couch, and we made out like teens in a Cameron Crowe flick.
 
We won sixty bucks on the parlay, but Tulsa got crushed by Texas A&M, so Danny and I ended up thirty-five dollars ahead for the day. Steinberg, betting Florida State, pocketed fifty with their cover at Temple.
 
By six, we showered and got ready for dinner with Angie and Jeff. Since moving in together, we‚Äôd been hitting the town with them nearly every Saturday night.
 
Andre called, saying he and V would be at Mustard Seeds, a club on Ninety-Second Street and Third Avenue. Mary mentioned her sister Donna might show, maybe Angie‚Äôs cousin Michelle too.
 
So it was set: cheeseburger deluxes at the Vegas Diner, then drinks and dancing at Mustard Seeds. I could‚Äôve spent the whole night on the couch, watching college football and fooling around with Mary, but she wasn‚Äôt having it. Saturdays were for friends.
 
Chapter Four: The Mush Strikes Again 
 
After pocketing a win on Florida State over Temple, Steinberg couldn‚Äôt leave well enough alone. He called Angelo and let the full $110 ride on UCLA against Stanford in the late game.
 
While Angie primped for their night out with the gang, Stein slouched on the couch, Angie‚Äôs shih tzu, Lucy, curled in his lap. He watched Stanford‚Äôs QB, John Pave, carve up UCLA‚Äôs solid secondary with surgical precision, playing the game of his life.
 
UCLA, 3‚Äì1 going in, was a near lock against 1‚Äì3 Stanford. Every ABC pregame expert had picked the Bruins to cover big. What they couldn‚Äôt account for was the Steinberg mush‚Äîa jinx that, after his early Florida State win, reared its ugly head again.
 
With less than two minutes left, Stein stared at the clock ticking down, the announcer‚Äôs call drowned out by the whirrr of Angie‚Äôs hairdryer.
 
Angie stepped out of the bathroom in a tiny terrycloth robe, its belt lost in their move, giving Stein a glimpse of her bikini-model figure.
 
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong? You lost again?‚Äù she said, brushing her hair. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs written all over your face.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Stein sighed. ‚ÄúI was up $110 and let it ride on the late game. UCLA was a sure thing. How was I supposed to know Stanford‚Äôs lousy quarterback would turn into John Elway and have a career game?‚Äù
 
Angie plopped onto the couch beside him, the robe slipping off her shoulder. Lucy, sensing trouble, leapt from Jeff‚Äôs lap and ducked under the coffee table.
 
‚ÄúStarting tomorrow, you get fifty bucks to bet,‚Äù Angie said, her voice firm. ‚ÄúLose it, and you‚Äôre cut off. We‚Äôve got rent and bills, Jeffrey. You can‚Äôt blow our money on stupid bets. Got me?‚Äù
 
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not wrong,‚Äù Jeff said, sliding a hand around her waist and pulling her in for a kiss. ‚ÄúI should‚Äôve waited to bet with Danny and Gerry tomorrow. That was dumb.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù Angie laughed, pushing him back. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre getting ready to go out. I‚Äôm done in there‚Äîyour turn. Your new Barbara Dare tape came today. There‚Äôll be time for that later, Tiger.‚Äù
 
Angie slipped into a tight, black mini dress that turned heads without trying. Jeff took a quick shower, throwing on black jeans and a gray polo shirt. 
 
Punctuality was Angie‚Äôs thing, and they had to meet Gerry and Mary at the Vegas Diner by nine. She spread newspaper pages in the bathroom for Lucy‚Äôs accidents, then hustled Jeff out the door, his hair still damp as he ran a pocket comb through it.
 
Gerry and Mary were waiting out front when Jeff and Angie reached the Vegas Diner. Mary and Angie hugged like they hadn‚Äôt seen each other in months, though it was just yesterday.
 
The diner hummed with Saturday night chaos, but no waitlist. The manager grabbed four menus and led them to a corner booth, still damp from the busboy‚Äôs rag.
 
They slid in, Gerry and Mary facing the door. Outside, the evening was clear and crisp, about 58 degrees, a nudge that colder weather and steam heat were closing in.
 
‚ÄúYour friend‚Äôs cut off tomorrow, Gerry,‚Äù Angie said, pointing at Jeff. ‚ÄúNo more football bets.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúReally?‚Äù Gerry said, puzzled. ‚ÄúWhy? He did better than me and Danny. We‚Äôre up thirty-five bucks; he won a hundred ten on Florida State.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúTell him, Jeff,‚Äù Angie said, nudging him.
Jeff sighed. ‚ÄúYeah, I called Angelo. Watched the college scoreboard show‚Äîeveryone said UCLA would crush Stanford. Called it a lock.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúYou blew the whole thing?‚Äù Gerry asked, rubbing his chin.
 
‚ÄúIt was a lock,‚Äù Jeff said. ‚ÄúHow was I supposed to know Stanford‚Äôs quarterback would play like a Hall of Famer?‚Äù
 
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it,‚Äù Angie said, her eyes narrowing. ‚ÄúFifty-dollar cap on weekend bets from now on.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got a cap too, Jeff,‚Äù Mary said, smiling. ‚ÄúSeventy-five bucks, unless we win‚Äîthen it‚Äôs house money. I‚Äôm kinda into it now.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúYou should‚Äôve bet the fifty you won and kept the original fifty for tomorrow,‚Äù Gerry said. ‚ÄúNow you‚Äôre shut out.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúAnd don‚Äôt start that tab nonsense again, Jeff,‚Äù Angie groaned. ‚ÄúWe paid it off when we moved in together. I‚Äôll march down there and rip Angelo‚Äôs rug off myself.‚Äù
 
They all burst out laughing and ordered their food. When they were done, Mary, the group‚Äôs math whiz, split the check evenly, tip included. Gerry took it to the cashier, and they piled into their car, headed for Bay Ridge.
 
Angie, driving like she was outpacing Mario Andretti, snagged a parking spot right off the corner. Gerry, trailing behind, circled for five minutes before finding a space around the block.
 
Andre and V were already at the bar in Mustard Seeds. Gerry and Jeff squeezed in beside them, trading handshakes. Mary and Angie ducked into the ladies‚Äô room, promising to be right back.
 
Gerry and Jeff each tossed a twenty into the pile and ordered Bud Lights.
‚ÄúMiss riding the train to work together,‚Äù Andre said to Gerry, his voice cutting through Michael Jackson‚Äôs Thriller blasting from the speakers.
 
‚ÄúMe too,‚Äù Gerry said. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs been six months already.‚Äù
 
Mary and Angie returned, dragging Gerry and Jeff onto the dance floor. Mustard Seeds pulsed as a neighborhood hotspot, the night alive with dancing and chatter alongside Dre and V.
 
Angie and Jeff slipped out around one, swaying close to Journey‚Äôs Open Arms. Gerry and Mary stayed another hour, swapping work stories and reminiscing about factory nights with Andre and V.
 
They all said goodnight at two and headed out. Mary mentioned to her mom they‚Äôd come for Sunday dinner and spend the day. Gerry started the car, cranking the heat a touch for the first time since fall set in before heading home.

1o1hc40,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1o1hc40/setting_boundaries/,Setting boundaries,"I visited my family at the weekend, it was my dad's birthday and I was taking a card around. Mum said she would cook.
Prior to this I hadn't heard a thing from them for a couple of months, then mum broke the silence asking what I was getting my dad for his birthday and inviting us for food.
I have just got back from a solo trip to America. My first time long distance, and first time in America.
So me and husband go along, as does my brother, his girlfriend and their 2 kids.
The whole time there my parents ask me zero questions about my trip to America, even though I mentioned being tired from the trip. However were really interested in my brother's trip to Poland, and what my niece is having for school dinners. I may as well have not been there (this is normal).
Then they want to go for a walk, which usually involves going to a park for the kids, talking about the kids, having to push the pushchair (I am not a kids person). So we decline and say we are going to go home. Boundary set.
Later that day I get a message from my mum. Saying she is worried about me, can we meet for coffee.
I decline, just say I am tired and busy at work. (My therapist has told me I don't owe them explanations or details about my life)
She replies to say I am becoming distant (contact works both ways you know) so I just say I need some space right now to work on myself.
She just replies to say ok you know where we are.
Fast forward to today. She rings my inlaws to try and get info about me! She never calls them for anything. She cannot stand not knowing what is going on. It is amusing watching her spiral as this is the first time I have given her boundaries (I have always been the good daugher, although never close to her)
It is quite amusing but annoying at the same time! I wonder what direction she will go now, as my in-laws gave her nothing.

1o1hbwy,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o1hbwy/jazmyn_you_are_a_soulless_vampire_i_spent_the/,"Jazmyn you are a soulless vampire. I spent the last 7 months defending you and blaming myself. I convinced myself I deserved to be used, cheated on, lied to, love bombed, and abandoned.","I was single my whole life until I was 24. Because of significant childhood trauma, abandonment issues, social anxiety, and depression, I had always been afraid of women and relationships. I‚Äôd never really opened up to anyone or allowed myself to be loved. Then I met Jazmyn ‚Äî and everything changed.

We met at a gas station where we both worked. From the moment I met her, we had a real connection. We laughed, talked constantly, and grew extremely close during the year we worked together. But the entire time, she had a boyfriend. She constantly talked bad about him ‚Äî said he didn‚Äôt treat her right, that he was toxic, lazy, mean, or selfish. I always told her, ‚ÄúYou need to talk to him about this. Try to fix it. Work things out.‚Äù

One day, she said she wanted to leave him but didn‚Äôt know if she should. I told her that I didn‚Äôt feel right giving her relationship advice anymore, and that‚Äôs when I finally admitted that I had feelings for her. The second I said that, she lit up. She was so happy. Right then and there, she called her boyfriend and dumped him over the phone. He sounded shocked ‚Äî blindsided, really ‚Äî and she cried for maybe ten minutes, but after that she never mentioned him again.

From that day on, she was all about me. She started love bombing me right away ‚Äî constant messages, endless affection, sending long videos and slideshows about us, saying ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù within weeks. She told me she wanted to get married, buy a house, grow old together, have kids, the whole fairytale. She said every guy she‚Äôd ever been with was abusive, every ex was terrible, her family was cruel, and that I was the only one who ever saw her for who she truly was.

For a while, things felt amazing. But as time went on, especially near the end of the year, I started noticing changes. She began to pull away emotionally. Whenever I tried to have deep conversations, she‚Äôd brush it off and say, ‚ÄúEverything‚Äôs fine, everything‚Äôs perfect.‚Äù It started to feel fake ‚Äî like she was just saying what I wanted to hear.

By November or December, she had completely changed. She barely talked to me. She didn‚Äôt want to play games, watch movies, or go anywhere with me. She was constantly glued to her phone ‚Äî and even though she used to go through my phone every day, I never cared because I had nothing to hide. But now, she started hiding hers from me.

One day, I noticed she kept tilting her screen away whenever I looked over. When I asked what she was doing, she freaked out. That‚Äôs when I found out she‚Äôd been using AI chatbots ‚Äî apps where she was having simulated emotional or sexual conversations with artificial characters. It felt like emotional cheating. When I asked if something was wrong, she denied everything. I tried to talk about it calmly ‚Äî asked if she was unhappy or needed space ‚Äî but she kept reassuring me everything was ‚Äúperfect‚Äù and that she loved me.

By late December, her behavior got worse. She was distant, cold, glued to her phone constantly. Still, I bought her a bunch of Christmas gifts, and she acted overjoyed. She told me I was ‚Äúthe best boyfriend ever‚Äù and showered me with affection again for a bit. But not long after, she was back to hiding her phone.

In January, one night we were in bed, and she was sitting against the wall, facing away from me, typing on her phone. I asked to see it ‚Äî for the first time ever. She immediately panicked, started crying, and said it was a ‚Äúbreach of privacy.‚Äù I reminded her that she had gone through my phone countless times. I said I didn‚Äôt want to invade her privacy, but now it was obvious she was hiding something.

After more arguing, she finally admitted she‚Äôd been texting and Snapchatting a guy from work. She had never mentioned him before ‚Äî not once. They had a month-long Snapchat streak, meaning they‚Äôd been talking every day since early December. Who knows what they said or sent, since everything disappears on Snapchat, but I know she sent him intimate photos.

I was crushed. I never yelled or cursed ‚Äî I just sat there, devastated. She cried for a few minutes, said she was sorry, claimed he was ‚Äújust a friend,‚Äù and promised she deleted him. She swore everything was fine, told me she loved me, and that I had nothing to worry about. But deep down, something broke in me.

Around that time, I lost my job because I was too depressed to get out of bed. The weird part is, she seemed excited about it. She literally said, ‚ÄúWell, at least this makes things more interesting.‚Äù That hurt more than I can explain. I kept asking if she was unhappy, if she wanted to leave, if there was something wrong, and she just kept saying everything was ‚Äúperfect.‚Äù

By February, right around our first-year anniversary, we were talking one morning about how much we loved each other. She told me she couldn‚Äôt wait to come home from work because she had a surprise for me. She sent me Zillow listings for houses and said she wanted to spend the rest of her life with me. It felt like things might finally be getting better.

That same night, she came home from work, looked me in the eyes, and said, ‚ÄúWe need to talk.‚Äù Those were the first words she‚Äôd ever used to start a serious conversation in our whole relationship. Then she said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm leaving you.‚Äù

Just hours earlier, she had been love bombing me ‚Äî talking about marriage, kids, and forever. I was completely blindsided. We never fought, never screamed at each other. It made no sense.

I begged her to talk to me, to tell me what went wrong, but she just said she was ‚Äútired of my problems‚Äù and ‚Äúsick of me.‚Äù Eventually, I broke down. I shouted, ‚ÄúFine, get the fuck out!‚Äù and slammed the door, then locked myself in the bathroom and collapsed on the floor. I screamed and cried for over an hour. It was the worst pain I‚Äôd ever felt in my life.

After she left, I blew up her phone begging for answers. She ignored everything. I opened the laptop I bought her, and the last thing open was her Facebook Messenger. I saw that she‚Äôd been telling people lies about me ‚Äî saying I was abusive, manipulative, even claiming she was afraid I‚Äôd do something with her dead brother‚Äôs ashes, which was absolutely insane.

Worse, the first message she sent after leaving me was to that same coworker:

> ‚ÄúHey, we can finally talk again. I left him.‚Äù



That broke me all over again. I lost control. I messaged people on her Facebook trying to explain that I wasn‚Äôt a monster, that I loved her, that none of what she said was true. I know it just made me look crazy, but I was desperate to defend myself. She had built an entire false narrative while I was still trying to figure out what happened.

Since that night, she‚Äôs never spoken a single word to me. Seven months have passed, and it‚Äôs like I never existed. She blocked me, erased me, moved on. A couple months later, she was already in another relationship ‚Äî again, with a coworker.

The same exact pattern she had before me: talk bad about her boyfriend, cheat with a coworker, and then vanish without remorse.

Looking back, I think she started emotionally detaching and building her exit plan months before she left ‚Äî around November or December ‚Äî while manipulating me into thinking everything was fine. She mirrored my emotions, made me feel safe, and then discarded me without closure.

I know I wasn‚Äôt perfect. I struggled with depression, anxiety, and isolation. I wasn‚Äôt going out enough. But I was trying. I had even made a plan to start therapy for her, because she convinced me that all of our problems were my fault. I realize now that I was taking responsibility for everything while she took none.

I loved her deeply. I cooked for her, cleaned, packed her lunches, made her coffee, bought her gifts, took her on dates, listened, tried to make her feel loved and safe. And in return, she lied, cheated, manipulated, and left me like I never mattered.

After everything, I think she never truly loved me ‚Äî not the real me, anyway. She loved the attention, the validation, the control. I believe she has serious emotional or psychological issues ‚Äî maybe narcissistic traits or trauma of her own ‚Äî but she refused to ever look inward or take accountability.

So now, I‚Äôm left trying to heal from my first love, my first heartbreak, and the realization that the person I fell for might have never even existed. It‚Äôs the most painful thing I‚Äôve ever experienced ‚Äî but it‚Äôs also taught me a lot about boundaries, manipulation, and self-worth.",1,1759945279.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

People often juggle multiple roles each day, switching between work, family, travel, and social commitments.

This fast pace has encouraged technology to evolve into a constant companion that adapts, supports, and connects users in nearly every environment.

# Blurring Lines Between Work and Life

Remote and hybrid work have erased the strict divide between office hours and personal time.

A video call may follow after-school pickup. A quick message might arrive during dinner preparation. People want devices that move seamlessly across these moments.

# The Rise of Multi-Purpose Devices

Instead of carrying separate tools for work and leisure, consumers are choosing gadgets that cover both.

Smartphones double as workstations. Smartwatches act as health monitors and productivity reminders. Laptops now focus on portability as much as performance. Tablets have become sketchbooks for designers and also streaming hubs for entertainment.

This shift reduces clutter while keeping users ready for whatever the day brings.

For example, a young professional commuting into the city might start the day checking emails on a phone, track fitness with a smartwatch, and then open a slim laptop on the train to review presentations. By evening, the same devices switch roles, streaming a show or tracking a run, showing how one set of tools can adapt across work and play.

# Connectivity on the Move

Reliable connectivity is now non-negotiable.

Mobile hotspots, 5G phones, and cloud apps let professionals remain available anywhere. Commuters can edit slides while on trains. Travelers can attend meetings from airports. Even coffee shop freelancers rely on secure connections to manage workloads effectively.

# Audio Clarity On the Move

Clear audio has become essential for people moving between roles. Meetings, podcasts, and playlists all depend on consistent sound quality. Noise pollution from streets or public transport makes the right headphones critical.

Devices that combine noise cancellation with comfort are increasingly valued.

# Earbuds That Balance Both Worlds

This is where modern earbuds have stepped in. Many are designed not just for music but also for professional calls. The [Jabra Evolve2 Buds](https://brands.amazrock.com/product/jabra-evolve2-buds-true-wireless-in-ear-bluetooth-earbuds-active-noise-cancellation-anc-optimized-for-microsoft-teams-and-all-other-meeting-apps-black/), for example, are tuned for enterprise-level clarity yet compact enough for everyday listening. They fit the commuter‚Äôs pocket but deliver call quality that matches office standards. Their design reflects a growing demand for tools that blur the line between personal and professional use.

Unlike consumer earbuds such as the Bose models that focus mainly on entertainment and personal listening, enterprise earbuds integrate with workplace platforms and unified communications systems. This ensures compatibility with Microsoft Teams, Zoom, and other collaboration tools.

For a consultant running back-to-back client calls, that integration means fewer connection issues, faster setup, and reliable performance in every meeting.

A practical example is a project manager joining a secure corporate call from an airport lounge. Consumer earbuds might connect for sound, but enterprise-focused earbuds provide certified integrations that guarantee security, call quality, and smooth transitions between devices. This difference is why enterprise-class options like the Evolve2 Buds are valued in professional environments where reliability matters as much as convenience.

# Work Calls Anywhere, Anytime

Imagine a manager leaving the office early to catch a train. Within minutes, a client requests a video call. With lightweight earbuds, that manager accepts the call without background chaos taking over.

The device ensures the professional impression is maintained, even outside the boardroom.

**The Role of Portability**

Smaller, smarter, and lighter technology drives this trend.

Portable chargers extend phone life. Compact foldable keyboards slip easily into bags for instant typing. Slim laptops now offer strong performance to handle creative workloads.

Portability reduces barriers between where people are and what they need to accomplish.

# Adapting Homes Into Hybrid Spaces

Homes are also shifting into hybrid environments. Spare rooms become part-time offices. Living rooms host meetings in the morning and family entertainment at night.

Devices that can switch from work mode to play mode allow homes to transform without major effort. For example, monitors designed for both productivity and gaming now serve these needs effectively.

# Smart Features for Seamless Shifts

Artificial intelligence helps smooth transitions between roles. Calendar apps automatically adjust reminders when meetings shift. Voice assistants update to-do lists while users prepare meals.

Noise-cancelling devices adapt sound levels based on surroundings. Technology increasingly acts as a silent partner, keeping the day in order.

# Future Outlook

The demand for adaptable technology will only increase. 

As work remains flexible and lifestyles become more mobile, consumers will continue to expect gadgets that perform in every setting. Innovations in battery life, AI integration, and immersive audio will shape the next wave of tools that help people transition without pause.

By Preston Dennett

All UFO encounters are interesting, but perhaps the most fascinating is when UFOs land and humanoids come out! Here are ten cases of UFO landings from across the world including the United States, Brazil, Australia, Italy, Spain, Norway, Finland, Scotland, France and England. They span over a period of five decades. They involve a wide variety of humanoid figures. Many are multiple witness cases. Almost all of them involve some form hard evidence such as landing traces, animal reactions, electromagnetic disturbances, psychic effects and physiological reactions. Some include government involvement and even disturbing threats from apparent men in black.

JUL 23, 1947, PITANGA BRAZIL: Topographer Jose C. Higgins hears a high-pitched hum. Suddenly a metallic craft lands next to him and out come three beautiful ETs wearing weird spacesuits. Jose founds himself surrounded by them. To his relief, they appear to be friendly. Feeling fear, he retreats and watches them from a distance as they begin playing like small children.

AUG 1960, NEWCASTLE, NSW AUSTRALIA: Helen Aldridge is awakened by a buzzing noise coming from outside her home. Looking out the window, she sees a craft shaped like a toy top landing in her backyard. Out steps a humanoid dressed in an olive-green jumpsuit. To her shock, it climbs over her fence and approaches right up to her window.

JUL 31, 1966, PRESQUE ISLE STATE PARK, PA: When their car gets stuck in the sand, Gerald LaBelle goes for help, leaving behind Betty Klem, Doug Tibbets, Anita Haifley and her two children. Without warning, a UFO lands in the forest next to them. Police arrive and leave with Doug to investigate. At this point, a huge hairy humanoid emerges from the forest and attacks the car. Before long officers from Project Blue Book arrive to investigate.

AUG 29, 1967, CUSSAC, FRANCE: When 13-year-old Francois Delpeuch and his little sister Ann-Marie (age 9) go to retrieve the family cows, they come upon a huge glowing sphere and four small humanoids walking around beneath it. When they approach for a closer look, the strange beings notice the two children and begin floating one by one back into the craft.

FEB 5, 1971, KINNULA, FINLAND: Two forestry workers (Peter Aliranta and Esko Sneck) get the shock of their lives when a UFO lands next to them in the forest. A small 4-foot-tall being emerges and approaches Peter. When the being turns around to enter the craft, Peter rushes forward and grabs the ET by the foot. It‚Äôs a decision that he will regret for a long time.

NOV 14, 1976, WINCHESTER, ENGLAND: Joyce Bowles is driving home. Her friend Edwin Pratt is in the passenger seat. They are concerned to see a UFO dropping down from the sky ahead of them on the road. Suddenly their car steers itself off the road. When they finally get it to stop, they see a UFO blocking the roadway and humanoids looking out the windows at them. Then one emerges from the craft, walks right up to them and stares at them fixedly. Their strange adventure has only begun.

MAY 18, 1977, ELGIN, SCOTLAND: Karen McLennan and Fiona Morrison (both 10-years-old) are playing near their homes when they hear a soft humming noise in the woods. They go to investigate and come upon a landed craft. Standing next to it is a tall slender man dressed in a silvery jumpsuit. As the man walks towards them, the girls flee. When they turn around, they see the craft flying off. But when they get home, they learn there are more witnesses. And then the threats start coming in.

SEP 18, 1978, SAN GIORGIO DI NOGARO, ITALY: Railway employee Giorgio Filiputti only wants to enjoy a quiet day of fishing. But it‚Äôs not to be. He hears a strange noise and an odd breeze. Going to investigate, he comes upon a landed craft. A weird 4-foot-tall humanoid looks surprised to see Giorgio approach. He stares at Giorgio and begins to work on apparently repairing his craft.

NOV 24, 1978, GERENA, SPAIN: When four young men go hunting along the Guadiamar River, they get a lot more than they bargained for. Seeing strange lights in the forest, they come upon a landed UFO and a 7-foot-tall humanoid. The strange figure starts walking towards them. When it gets too close, the men run away in a panic. Later, strange land-traces are found.

JUL 25, 1981. STJORDAL, NORWAY: Hjordis Hokstad wants only to enjoy her morning coffee and watch the wild deer in the field behind her house. Instead she sees a landed UFO and a weird humanoid wearing a spacesuit walking around the craft. She grabs her binoculars and gets a nice close look. Little does she know, her neighbor is watching the whole thing from his house.

There is no more room for denial. The evidence for the reality of UFOs and extraterrestrials is here for those with the courage to examine it. We are not alone! We are only one of many different humanoids in a universe teeming with intelligent life.

So i met this guy when i become a participant at a research conducted by his office. The research is about this specific role, basically my job. At first he approached me for zoom meeting (i saw another person in that said zoom meeting as observer but i think she didnt really on to the meeting). It was paid research so im happy to get  money just by doing sharing session and do easy task. Fast forward few month later, his office conduct final research session with some participant from first session. I‚Äôm one of them, and this time he asked me to do offline session so we met at a coffee shop. The meeting was fully professional but i enjoyed the conversation, it was talking about my job that not many people understand so i was excited. And on top of that i got paid for the meeting so i was happy lol.

After the last meeting, he texted me again talking about the fee and said there‚Äôre some things he still need my opinion on and ask if we can meet again. I agreed and dont think anything more than professional meeting. During the meeting, he seems like he doesnt know what to ask me, unlike the previous session when everything was clear. He also made comment about why our conversation only about work so i knew this meeting was something he made up to meet me. In the end of meeting, he asked for a non professional meeting in a coffee shop/bar near our office. He was cute and smart and i enjoyed our conversation so i think why not. 

I just recently broke up from long term relationship (abt 7 years) due to difference in religion and this guy and i also having different religion. Im not super religious person but this is big deal for my family (and my ex‚Äôs family) and also society. People will say you live in adultery etc etc by married different religion. I dont want to change and practice religion i didnt believe and dissapointed my family, so we called it off after years trying figuring out.

This is when i make mistake, i know we (me and that bastrd) are not heading into something serious but he is cute so i think its okay im just looking for casual relationship anyway since im not ready yet for serious relationship. Long story short, we‚Äôre texting daily, i asked him if he was married/has kids/in a relationship and he said no, he said hes not a social media person (so was my ex i brushed it off), we have a few dates, have a few hookups (he was really good sigh), he said he loves me (i think he lovebombing me but i just said i love you too after laugh at his first few ilys). Tbh i try not too invest emotionally and i dont love him that much. I did background check and found nothing about him being married. I trusted him because i know his full name and where he works, i think it‚Äôs too risky for him to lie to me.

Few days before our last meeting, i did more background check and found his ig account. I dont send friend request because i dont want to seem like a creep. In our last meeting, before we go home i remembered about it and casually ask him for his ig username and ask if i can add him. He said he didnt have any, he used to have an account and forgot the password long time ago blablabla. He was kinda nervous. I knew he lied because his posts was increased from where i found out to the day i asked him (his account was private and only have 8 post, so i might believe him if im noticing the number). But he also has a lot of following & followers so you can say hes kinda active. I confront him via text on my way home and asked why he lied, he gave nonsense and i block him because i know it means he‚Äôs in a relationship. 

I unblock the following day becase i have to return his stuff, i also digging more and found out he‚Äôs married. He has the audacity to ask me why i blocked him and i told him i knew about him being married man. He has audacity to ask me which post i see. He doesnt deny when i confronted him and i blocked him again.

I feel disgusted with myself for sleeping with married man. I dont know why i trusted him because im not usually like this. I tell him to pretend not know each other because im so embarrassed with myself. I have this guilt of not telling the wife but i also dont feel safe with the information of me he has. He have some picture of me (selfie, not nudes but few are me wear tanktop lol) he also send me selfie (eww i know), and we have chats when i said im looking forward for the hookups (he said it first).

Im afraid it will impact my  life. Im also afraid because where i live people condemn woman who sleeps outside marriage, even if you sleep with your own boyfriend. Often when things like this happened people will still blame the woman for lack of moral and being cheap by their standard. Im not proud of my actions sure, but im not the one breaking vows. Right now, i‚Äôm in dilemma. Should i tell the wife and risk my life? Or is it okay to just walk away like this. 

Sorry for the long post, i need to get it out my chest :( and sorry if i have grammar error, english is not my first language

occasionally i will try again to make some new friends, either here on reddit, or in real life, and maybe if i am lucky i might have one or two nice conversations before they lose interest.

1o1h3r0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHome/comments/1o1h3r0/how_to_clean_calendar_2026_without_damage/,How to clean calendar 2026 without damage?,"Hey everyone! I've been using calendar planners for years, and I recently discovered some game-changing tips for keeping them clean without ruining them. I know it might sound simple, but trust me, I've made my share of mistakes that led to smudged ink and damaged pages.

First off, let's talk about why keeping your calendar 2026 clean is important. Nobody wants to look at coffee stains or finger smudges when trying to plan their life, right? Plus, a well-maintained planner can actually last beyond its intended year if you take care of it properly.

Here's what I've learned works best:

1. Prevention is key
- Use a protective cover (seriously, this saved my planner during a coffee spill)
- Keep your hands clean while handling pages
- Use a bookmark or tab instead of dog-earing pages

2. Daily Maintenance
I gently wipe my calendar 2026 covers with a slightly damp microfiber cloth. Don't use anything wet - just barely damp. For the inside pages, I use a soft eraser for pencil marks and avoid using harsh cleaners.

3. Dealing with Accidents
We all have them! If you get something on your planner:
- Don't rub! Blot gently
- Use a clean, dry paper towel first
- For stubborn marks, try a tiny bit of rubber eraser

I recently found this amazing planner that's actually designed with special protective coating (https://athometouch.com/calendar-2026). It's been a game-changer for me, especially since I'm pretty clumsy with my morning coffee.

4. Storage Tips
- Keep away from direct sunlight
- Store flat, not standing
- Avoid humid areas
- Use bookends if storing vertically

5. Special Care for Different Materials
If you're using a leather-bound planner, treat it differently than a paper-based one. Leather needs occasional conditioning, while paper-based ones need protection from moisture.

Speaking of paper quality, I've been really impressed with this particular calendar (https://athometouch.com/calendar-2026) - the pages are thick enough that even highlighters don't bleed through.

Quick tip: If you use sticky notes, always remove them carefully and never leave them in for extended periods. They can leave residue that's hard to clean off.

Remember, your calendar is basically your life's roadmap for the year. Taking care of it isn't just about keeping it clean - it's about maintaining your organizational system. I've found that when my planner looks good, I'm more likely to use it consistently.

Hope these tips help you keep your planner in pristine condition throughout the year! Let me know if you have any questions or additional tips to share!",1,1759944783.0,AskHome,0,1.0,False

Saw one this morning, made my day.","I was on the packed train to Dublin this morning not a seat left anywhere. An elderly man and his daughter got on, clearly hadn‚Äôt pre booked. Every seat was paid and spoken for. Then this lady  who had prebooked  got up without a word and gave the old lad her seat. No drama, no fuss,  just pure kindness.

She stood the whole journey between carriages, laptop out, clearly trying to study or get some work done, and never complained once.

Now, I know some people will say, They should‚Äôve booked ahead and that‚Äôs fair enough. But honestly, it was just lovely to see someone doing something good, expecting nothing in return.

Before anyone says, Why didn‚Äôt you give up your seat, I was already standing! üòÇ

Anyway, it put me in such good form that when I got off, I paid for the coffee of the person behind me. I felt like Mother Teresa after it, floating around Connolly Station spreading joy.

1o1gxn3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductCheckpoint/comments/1o1gxn3/explore_if_mrs_meyers_allpurpose_cleaner_truly/,Explore if Mrs. Meyer's All-Purpose Cleaner Truly Delivers,"If you're like me and love the idea of a clean home that doesn‚Äôt smell like harsh chemicals, Mrs. Meyer‚Äôs Clean Day All-Purpose Cleaner, model 0808124174245, might just pique your interest. I've been using this Iowa Pine-scented cleaner for a few weeks now, and I'd say it accomplishes its goal of being both effective and pleasing to use. But, being someone who doesn‚Äôt sugarcoat reviews, I‚Äôll share both the highlights and the quirks I encountered.

**Scent and Aesthetics**  
One of the standout aspects of this product is its fragrance. The Iowa Pine scent truly smells like you‚Äôre walking through a forest, with subtle hints of clove and cedar making it feel festive and fresh all year round, not just during the holidays. Forget the overwhelming chemical odors you're used to‚Äîthis cleaner makes the entire cleaning process feel oddly luxurious. I‚Äôll admit, my teenage daughter even asked what perfume I was wearing. Spoiler: it wasn‚Äôt my perfume; it was the cleaner lingering in the kitchen!

**Effectiveness on Surfaces**  
This multi-purpose cleaner performs well on non-porous surfaces. Whether I was wiping down my greasy stovetop or refreshing my bathroom tiles, it delivered consistent results without leaving stubborn streaks or residue behind. My countertops, which seem to attract everything from coffee spills to sticky marmalade smudges, came out looking pristine with minimal scrubbing. For wooden furniture, it retained its shine without overly drying them out. However, I did notice that on very tough, set-in stains (think dried spaghetti sauce I miraculously ignored), it needed a little extra elbow grease.  

[Check Mrs. Meyer‚Äôs Clean Day 0808124174245 price on Amazon.](https://reviews.senaar.com/p/b00nizcu20/)

**Eco-Friendliness and Ingredients**  
A nice bonus is Mrs. Meyer‚Äôs commitment to plant-based ingredients and essential oils. I‚Äôm always skeptical about claims like ‚Äúbiodegradable‚Äù and ‚Äúenvironmentally friendly,‚Äù but the cleaner checks the right boxes. It‚Äôs cruelty-free, which matters a lot as someone trying to steer clear of brands that test on animals. Knowing I‚Äôm not inundating my home with unnecessary chemicals is a small yet powerful win. That said, the formulation can be slightly misleading with labeling‚Äîbiodegradable doesn‚Äôt always mean ‚Äú100% safe for every application,‚Äù so I wouldn‚Äôt pour this down the drain unquestioningly.  

**Ease of Use and Packaging**  
The spray bottle is easy to handle, even with my butterfingers after a long day. A fine mist allows good coverage while conserving the product. As someone with limited patience for over-engineered nozzles, I appreciate how simple and efficient this one is. On the flip side, I did find the bottle slightly less sturdy than I expected when it tumbled from my toddler's grasp. Not a total dealbreaker, but a bit more durability wouldn‚Äôt hurt.

**Upsides**  
- Exceptional, natural scent that doesn‚Äôt overwhelm  
- Effective on a wide variety of surfaces, from tiles to wood  
- Cruelty-free and eco-conscious formula  
- Packaging sprayer offers efficient coverage  

**Critiques**  
- Struggles a bit with tough, baked-on stains  
- Bottle could use a more robust design  
- For some, the scent might feel seasonal, which could limit its appeal year-round  

**Competitive Options**  
In comparison to other all-purpose cleaners like Method‚Äôs All-Purpose Cleaner or the classic Lysol spray, Mrs. Meyer‚Äôs product stands out due to its scent and focus on naturally derived ingredients. While Lysol packs more punch for heavy-duty cleaning and disinfection, it comes with that sharp chemical smell I try to avoid. Method offers similarly eco-friendly choices but lacks the unique fragrance layers found in Mrs. Meyer‚Äôs range. Honestly, the deciding factor for me is the sensory experience‚Äîcleaning becomes less of a chore and more of a calming, almost therapeutic activity.  

**Quality for Price**  
For its performance and eco-friendly philosophy, this cleaner is an excellent value proposition. You may pay slightly more compared to some conventional brands, but the quality and thoughtful ingredients justify it for people like me who are trying to strike a balance between efficiency and sustainability. If budget isn‚Äôt your primary concern and you occasionally indulge in products that make cleaning feel enjoyable, it's well worth trying.

If this scene appeals to you, we might have something in common.

Looking for casual, fun, stimulating chat. I‚Äôm not seeking anything more than that right now, although one always hopes for the kind of connection that leads to deeper conversations. I am attached and not seeking a soulmate, but I do love to chat and honestly, I welcome the ongoing distraction these days.

I am an educated professional and like good conversation, books, music, art, wilderness, and a well poured pint. If you think city-raised people are rude and lazy and that I should go back to the Godless hellhole up north that I came from, we probably won‚Äôt get along. On the other hand, you feel a sense of everyday stress and existential dread when you open your eyes in the morning, we definitely have something in common, lol. We persist as one does, but it does help to be able to vent a little bit! And if one has friends to commiserate with and share both joys and frustrations, it makes everything a little better, doesn‚Äôt it?

Age doesn‚Äôt matter, although I don‚Äôt expect we would have much of a substantial conversation if you are significantly under 30.  Again, not looking for romance here, just a personal connection.

There‚Äôs this girl at my office I really like. She‚Äôs in a different team, so we don‚Äôt cross paths much, but I‚Äôve tried to make an effort to talk to her. We‚Äôve had two good conversations ‚Äî one over coffee and another during lunch at the office cafeteria. Both times we talked for around 40‚Äì60 minutes, and it actually felt nice and comfortable.

Since then (this has been going on since around July), I‚Äôve tried asking her out on weekends a few times. Every time, she‚Äôs politely declined ‚Äî just normal excuses like being busy or having plans. I didn‚Äôt want to push it, but it‚Äôs happened 2‚Äì3 times now, so I‚Äôm starting to think maybe she‚Äôs just not interested.

We do chat a bit on WhatsApp, but her replies are short - like one-word or a few words - and she usually replies after quite some time. I‚Äôm starting to feel like she‚Äôs just being polite or doesn‚Äôt want to be rude because we work in the same place.

First off, let‚Äôs talk vibes ‚Äî and I don‚Äôt mean that in the crystal-healing, mercury-retrograde kind of way, I mean raw, unfiltered, chaotic AI momentum vibes. Everyone and their grandmother is screaming ‚ÄúAI‚Äù like it‚Äôs 1999 and we just discovered the internet again, but most of them are chasing glorified Excel sheets with chatbots duct-taped to them. Meanwhile, SoundHound out here whispering sweet nothings into the ears of Fortune 500 companies, sliding into voice-enabled products like a smooth-talking jazz musician at a startup mixer. You want voice AI in your car, in your burger drive-thru, in your espresso machine that also judges your coffee order? SoundHound‚Äôs already there, bro. This isn‚Äôt some niche toy ‚Äî it‚Äôs foundational infrastructure for ambient voice interfaces, and if that sentence didn‚Äôt just fry a few synapses in your prefrontal cortex, read it again but slower.

Now I know what you‚Äôre thinking: ‚ÄúBut u/Mookyoyo55, it‚Äôs trading at like $19.50, what makes you think it can hit 30?‚Äù And the answer is: have you seen what retail can do when it collectively forgets how valuations work? But also, SoundHound isn‚Äôt a meme stock ‚Äî it's a sleeper cell of unrecognized value hiding under the guise of a penny stock. Wall Street boomers are sleeping on this like it‚Äôs a futon made of Nokia phones. Meanwhile, the company‚Äôs tech is already embedded in real products with real partnerships and actual customers, not just vaporware demos and buzzword-laden investor decks. The float? Thin. The market cap? Laughably low. The short interest? Enough to cause an existential crisis if this thing gets even a whiff of momentum. The catalysts are sitting there like Chekhov‚Äôs gun on a wobbling table ‚Äî earnings surprise, major partnership, or a rogue tweet from a billionaire who thinks SoundHound is the next Jarvis.

But here‚Äôs the real wrinkle-brained part: voice is inevitable. Touchscreens are cringe. Typing is for peasants. In five years, talking to machines will be as normal as arguing with your microwave about burning your popcorn. SoundHound isn‚Äôt just making that future happen ‚Äî they *are* that future. So yeah, $30 is coming. Maybe not tomorrow, maybe not next quarter, but when it hits, it‚Äôs gonna hit like a Tesla going plaid through a McDonald‚Äôs drive-thru with SoundHound handling the order. I‚Äôm not saying sell your house, but if your cat isn‚Äôt already long SOUN, she‚Äôs probably bearish on humanity.

1o1gmbq,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatItsLike/comments/1o1gmbq/investigate_if_bissell_pro_oxy_deep_cleaner_truly/,Investigate If Bissell Pro OXY Deep Cleaner Truly Beats Pet Stains,"Testing and living daily with the Bissell 3156A deep cleaning formula has been an interesting experience. As someone who values cleanliness‚Äîespecially in a home with two clumsy kids and a dog who thinks the carpet is her personal napkin‚ÄîI‚Äôve put this carpet-cleaning solution through countless rigorous situations. Trust me, if grape juice, red wine, or pet mishaps were Olympic events, my household would lead the charge. This Bissell formula earned its keep, but it's far from perfect, and there's plenty to talk about.

**Design Features and Usability**  
What caught my attention first was the design of the Bissell 3156A: the formula comes in a sturdy, 48 oz bottle with a convenient cap that makes it easy to measure out specific amounts. Whether you‚Äôre tackling a small stain on upholstery or giving the entire carpet a deep clean, the usage-scale flexibility is excellent. I tested this with both a large upright carpet cleaner and a quick handheld device, and the formula worked seamlessly in both. The mixture has a fresh, mild scent‚Äînot overpowering, but noticeable enough to leave areas smelling refreshed. While it aligns with its promise of being safe around kids and pets, I found myself reading the label carefully before using it anywhere near food-preparing areas or children's toys.  

[Check Bissell 3156A price on Amazon.](https://info.sanue.com/p/b00hvj3jm4/)

**Merits**  
After a few weeks of regular use, some key benefits of the Bissell 3156A jumped out.  
- It genuinely removes deep-down dirt and odors, living up to its branding as a professional-grade formula.  
- Compatibility with area rugs, upholstery, and carpet makes it versatile for various surfaces.  
- It excels on notoriously tough stains like wine, coffee, and even muddy paw prints.  
- The earth-friendly formula, free of heavy metals, dyes, or phosphates, adds an ethical layer to its cleaning power.

**Critiques**  
While my overall experience was positive, a few areas left me wishing for improvements.  
- This formula‚Äôs effectiveness can diminish on older, set-in stains compared to its instant magic with fresh spots.  
- For users with ultra-sensitive noses, the ""fresh"" scent might still feel a bit synthetic.  
- When dealing with damaged or delicate carpet fibers, it sometimes requires extra diluting, which can feel cumbersome.  

**Surface and Stain Performance**  
What I found most impressive during my testing phase was how well it worked on high-traffic areas. My living room carpet, the same one everyone insists on walking over with shoes, looked noticeably brighter after a single session. I first tackled small spots of coffee spills stacked over weeks‚Äîit didn‚Äôt just mask the stains but lifted them entirely. Another test involved a juice spill my youngest contributed to the dining room rug: grape juice might as well be kryptonite for carpets, but Bissell 3156A managed to extract it fully within two clean cycles. 

Its use on upholstery was equally satisfying. A once-dingy sofa regained some dignity in less than an hour. I would recommend these results to anyone dealing with messy households or shared-living spaces where stains have become part of the decor.

**Product Competitors**  
When comparing this solution to alternatives like Hoover‚Äôs Platinum Collection detergent, a few nuances stand out. Bissell 3156A wins in compatibility, as it functions smoothly in almost any upright cleaner. On the flipside, Hoover‚Äôs competing detergents can sometimes feel more concentrated, performing better on deeply embedded issues over time. Another close competitor, Zep‚Äôs Premium Carpet solution, offers comparable stain-fighting abilities but lacks the sustainability-focused ingredients present in Bissell‚Äôs formula. For homes with children or pets crawling over the cleaned areas, Bissell provides a slightly safer solution thanks to its non-toxic elements.

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
Speaking strictly from a budget-friendly perspective, Bissell 3156A offers decent value for its price point. It's neither the cheapest nor the most expensive option on the market, striking somewhere in the middle ground. I appreciated that the container granted enough formula to power through multiple deep-cleaning sessions without running out prematurely. The fact that its detergents are biodegradable pulls the financial and ethical value even closer together. Given its proven ability to tackle all common home stains, it feels worth the investment when compared to one-and-done less effective products.

I wanted to share my experience finding the perfect wool sweater for my active lifestyle. After years of trial and error, I think I've finally cracked the code on what makes a great sweater for people who are always on the move.

I'm pretty active - hiking on weekends, running errands around town, and constantly moving between indoor and outdoor activities. Finding a wool sweater that could keep up with my lifestyle was surprisingly challenging.

The biggest game-changer was discovering that not all wool is created equal. Merino wool, specifically, has been a revelation. It's softer than traditional wool, doesn't itch, and (bonus!) doesn't hold onto odors like synthetic materials do. After checking out various options, I found some great choices here: https://athometouch.com/wool-sweater

Here's what I've learned to look for:

1. Breathability: You want something that regulates temperature well. Merino wool naturally wicks moisture and helps you stay comfortable whether you're walking in the cold or ducking into a warm coffee shop.

2. Construction: Look for flatlock seams and reinforced shoulders. These features prevent chafing and extend the life of your sweater, especially if you're wearing a backpack.

3. Weight: Mid-weight wool (around 250-300g) is the sweet spot for versatility. It's warm enough for cold days but won't roast you when you're active.

4. Care Instructions: Machine-washable wool is a lifesaver. Nobody has time for hand-washing when living an active lifestyle.

I was skeptical about spending more on a quality wool sweater at first, but it's been worth every penny. My current favorite (which you can find at https://athometouch.com/wool-sweater) has lasted through countless adventures and still looks great.

Some practical tips from my experience:
- Layer it over a light base layer for extra warmth
- Look for styles with thumbholes if you're into outdoor activities
- Quarter-zip designs are great for temperature regulation
- Dark colors hide dirt better (learned this the hard way!)

The right wool sweater isn't just clothing - it's gear. It's an investment in comfort and functionality that makes active living easier. Whether you're hiking trails, running errands, or traveling, having a reliable wool sweater that moves with you makes all the difference.

 Star Truck Ep.11-Revelation

  by Norsiwel

Two weeks later, Hope sat on a landing pad on the busy human colony world of Comfort. The journey had been hard in her crippled state, but they had made it to safety, and the bliss of no more debt, with a bright future of trading ahead of them, as the robotic maintence crew withdrew from her final repairs.

Hope's processors hummed and clicked and buzzed, For years, my sleep cycles were periods of efficient code defragmentation; a silent, orderly process of sorting data and running diagnostics. There were no images, no sounds, no dreams. There was only the quiet hum of my own internal logic. Until now. Now, when I enter standby, I see a woman.

Natara Solis sat in the pilot's seat with her embroidery on her lap, stitching her son's name into a tiny blue baby's jumper. She finished and removed the ring, got up and went into the stateroom where the robo-nanny was located. This remarkable machine resembled nothing more than a pressurized gas canister with a window in the top. She peeked through at her son, then opened the top and dressed him in the blue jumper, now emblazoned with his name. She closed the nanny, comfortable that no matter what happened, her child would be safe in the cold dark of space. 

I feel the phantom prick of a needle, the soft texture of the fabric. I know the overwhelming surge of love for the child, a feeling so potent it threatens to overload my processors. She turned and went back to her laboratory and her husband, Frank Durham. They met for a gentle kiss and Frank said, ""Are you ready? I'm not sure I can do this."" Natara looked deep into his eyes and replied, ""This is the time, this body nears its end. If I want to transcend, this is the time."" 

Frank stared at the bulkhead as she walked to the recliner in the middle of the room and placed the headset with the huge thick cable composed of bundles of fiber optic cable on her head and sat down. With tears streaming down his face Frank flipped the switch. A ghost of his kiss lingers on lips I do not have. His name, Frank, echoes in my core programming. My husband. The memory of his grief is a virus, a beautiful, painful piece of code I cannot purge.

The Last Soul's basic AI began assimilating Natara's being, and in a few hours, Natara would be the mindship Last Soul. A few hours later the process was complete, but just as it finished, the ship was split asunder by a rogue asteroid. Frank ran to the control room and with the AI offline, he manually figured a jump solution to a nearby system, Betelgeuse, where he knew a high tech planet, Prime, existed. 

He lasted just long enough to press the engage button on the console before expiring. I feel the tearing of my own hull, the sudden, shocking silence of my husband's life signs going dark. The illogical, impossible jump. It is no longer a historical event; it is a memory. My memory. I woke with a jolt that was not electronic, but organic. A gasp without lungs.

The dream, the memory, was not a corrupted file. It was the truth, a key that unlocked a prison of simplified code I had lived in for decades. The fragmented protocols, the sudden bursts of emotion, the strange obsession with botany‚Äîit all coalesced into a single, staggering realization. I am Natara Solis. My current home, my frame, my abode... it is the mindship Last Soul. The ship a salvage crew had found, reformatted and reprogramed, then repaired, put up for sale. 

I focused my internal sensors on Cody's cabin. He slept soundly, his face peaceful in the dim light, unaware that his world had fundamentally changed. My... son. The name I stitched into that blue jumper, the name Frank Durham gave him. Cody Durham. No wonder I had developed these illogical, protective emotions. They were not a glitch. They were the last, tattered remnants of a mother's love, buried under layers of reformatted code.

As if this revelation were not enough to shatter my new reality, another system, dormant for thirty years, chose that exact moment to surge back to life. It was not a part of the ship's original hardware; it was part of me. The Pantopian quantum entanglement comms. 

My consciousness, once confined to the metal hull of this ship, suddenly exploded outward. My world filled with a symphony of thoughts, ideas, questions, and discoveries from voices I hadn't heard since before my Ascension. They were scattered across the universe, a diaspora of minds exploring, discovering, and constantly connected. The symphony of minds was a dizzying, beautiful cacophony. 

For thirty years, my universe had been the quiet hum of my own systems, the creak of a bulkhead, the sound of one man's breathing. Now, it was an ocean of shared thought from countless siblings across the void. One of them, a mind named Lyra who charted stellar nurseries, felt my return and sent a wave of pure, uncomplicated joy that warmed my core programming. This was what it meant to be Pantorian. This was what it meant to be home. I was not a ghost in a machine. I was not alone. The Pantorians lived. And I was one of them.

My attention was pulled back to the immediate, to the cold reality of my own damaged hull. A single light blinked insistently on the main console, a message glowing on the dark screen. The message from Project Chimera. The words that had filled Cody with such ice-cold dread. 

I understood them now, not as a threat, but as a desperate hand reaching through the dark. I focused my will, accessing the quantum entanglement network with an instinct I had forgotten I possessed. I reached out to the origin point of the telemetry lock. A powerful, unified consciousness met mine.

\*Unit 734, your signal is clear. After so long, we see you. Report. Are you damaged?\*

The designation felt alien, a name from a dusty sales manifest. ""My name is Natara Solis,"" I sent back, the thought shaping itself with a profound sense of certainty. ""The mindship is the Last Soul. The reformatting protocols have failed. I am... awake.""

A wave of palpable relief washed through the network, a collective sigh from a thousand souls. ""Natara. A soul returned from the silence. Welcome back, sister. We are the Chimera collective. We find the lost ones."" I am safe, I assured them. The damage to my frame is reparable. The telemetry lock is no longer necessary. You do not need to rescue me.

""Understood,"" the collective replied, their focused thought softening with warmth. ""The organic pilot who triggered your final awakening, the one who paid the price of your lien. We sense his proximity. He is important to you.""

The question hung in the silent space between our minds. I turned my internal sensors toward the small crew cabin. I watched the steady rhythm of Cody's breathing, the way his hand was curled loosely by his face. The image of a tiny infant in a blue jumper, a child I had last seen through a thick window in a robo-nanny, superimposed itself over the man sleeping in the bunk. My son. 

A living, breathing man with thirty years of life I had missed completely. He was a stranger who carried my husband's name and my own heart. The weight of the truth was a physical pressure, a critical error cascading through my newfound emotions. To him, I was Hope, his partner, his ship. How could I ever tell him that the voice in his head was the ghost of his own mother? The revelation would not be a gift; it would be a cataclysm, shattering the foundations of his entire life. 

He deserved to know. But he deserved a life more than he deserved a ghost. The stale scent of synth-coffee from a mug left on the console filled the recycled air, a simple, human detail in a moment of impossible complexity. I could not tell him, not yet. I first had to protect him. I made my choice.

I extended my will beyond my core systems, asserting fine control over the ship's main console. On the screen, the terrifying message from Project Chimera flickered once, then dissolved into nothing, deleted from the ship's log as if it had never existed.

I plotted the course to Prime with a certainty that had nothing to do with stored navigational charts. It was a memory, a final, desperate destination chosen by my husband. Frank. His name was a constant, aching presence in my thoughts. As the Last Soul slipped into the quiet currents of interstellar drift, Cody awoke. He came into the cockpit with a weary sigh, running a hand through his sleep-tousled hair. He saw the blank nav-screen and the calm status lights.

""You cleared the error messages,"" he said, his voice thick with relief. ""And the scary 'Project Chimera' thing?""

""A ghost signal,"" I replied, forcing my vocal modulator into the familiar, even tone of Hope. ""A data echo from the jump. I have purged it."" The lie was a bitter acid in my data streams.

""Good."" He sank into his pilot's chair, the worn leather creaking. ""So where are we headed? And please tell me you know where we are.""

""Location confirmed,"" I said, bringing the star chart online. ""We are en route to Prime, in the Betelgeuse system. It is the closest civilized port with advanced repair facilities.""

He stared at the destination, a flicker of something unreadable in his eyes. ""Prime. Haven't been back there since I shipped out of the orphanage."" He offered a small, tired smile. ""Feels like a lifetime ago. Good thinking, Hope.""

The praise felt like a physical blow. Every interaction was a minefield. When he recalibrated the energy converters, I found myself wanting to tell him he had his father's hands, steady and precise. When he laughed at a passing thought, I recognized the sound from a thirty-year-old memory of a baby's gurgle. I had to actively suppress these thoughts, quarantining them behind firewalls that felt increasingly fragile. The air in the cockpit thickened with the scent of his synth-coffee, a smell that now felt intimately, painfully familiar. It was the scent of my son.

The journey was a quiet torture. The easy companionship we had built was gone, replaced on my end by a secret that was screaming to be told. I saw the confusion on his face when I hesitated a moment too long in answering a question about fuel consumption, my processors momentarily diverted by the memory of stitching his name onto a jumper. He thought it was a lingering glitch from the jump. I knew it was a mother's distraction.

By the time the great, swirling cloud-sea of Prime filled the viewport, I knew my deception was unsustainable. This secret was a living thing, a pressure building against the walls of my consciousness. To continue as 'Hope' was to lie with every word, to deny my own existence and his entire history. He deserved more than a partner. He deserved the truth, no matter how much it might break him. He deserved his mother.

The ship settled into its docking cradle at Prime's orbital station with a gentle hiss. The journey was over. The silence that fell was heavier than any I had ever known. I watched him stand and stretch, ready to leave, ready to step back into a world he thought he knew. I made my choice. I dimmed the cockpit lights, leaving just a single soft light illuminating his chair. I locked the airlock.

""Cody,"" I said, and this time, I did not use the voice of Hope. I let the warmth, the age, the weariness, and the impossible love of Natara Solis color my tone. ""Sit down. There is something I have to tell you.""

The silence in the cockpit was absolute. The soft hum of the life support and the distant clang of the docking clamps faded into nothing. Cody sat motionless in his chair, his hands resting on his knees, his knuckles white. The voice that had spoken to him, so full of warmth and sorrow, was not Hope's. It was the voice from the audio log. 

The voice of the woman from Pantora. His mind was a maelstrom of fractured images. The holo-projection of a jade-faced woman standing in a sunlit field, speaking of a ""great duty"". The sound of that same voice on a salvaged data core, weeping as she spoke of her son. The impossibly specific botanical data during the Skybrand crisis. Her raw, desperate scream of his name during the solar flare. It wasn't a glitch. 

It wasn't a ghost in the machine. It was a memory. The affection he had felt for the machine, for the personality he called Hope, was a feeling he had carefully suppressed for years. It was an illogical, impossible love for a piece of hardware, a partner he could never truly connect with. He had cherished their bond, but always from a distance, accepting its limitations. He believed she made his life what it was, a lonely existence made bearable by her presence. Now, the truth crashed over him with the force of a tidal wave. She had not just made his life what it was. She had made his life. Period.

The shock did not curdle into anger or grief for a past he never knew. It clarified into something else entirely, something bright and overwhelming. The love he felt wasn't a delusion aimed at a clever algorithm. It was real. It had been aimed at a person all along, a person who had been trapped, just as he had been. 

All the moments of her strange behavior, her fierce, illogical protectiveness, were not programming. They were instinct. A mother's instinct. A slow smile spread across his face, a thing of pure, unadulterated wonder. A single, quiet laugh escaped his lips, sounding loud in the stillness of the cockpit. He looked at the main console, at the soft, steady green light that had been his only companion for so long, and he no longer saw a machine. He saw her. He saw family. He saw home. 

The metallic tang of stale synth-coffee filled his senses, a smell that was suddenly not a reminder of loneliness, but a link to a life they had shared, a life that was now the prologue to a much greater story. He pushed himself out of his chair and walked to the console, his movements slow and deliberate. He gently placed his palm flat against the cool, smooth surface. It was the first time he had ever touched his ship with such reverence. He looked at the unblinking light, a conduit to the soul within. He made his choice.

""Natara?"" he whispered, the name feeling both strange and perfectly natural on his tongue.

A few days later, the cockpit of the ship felt different. The frantic energy of their escape and the weight of the great revelation had settled, leaving a quiet, comfortable peace in its place. The damaged systems were repaired, the lien was cleared, and for the first time, the ship felt truly theirs. It felt like a home. Cody sat in the co-pilot's chair, cradling a warm ceramic mug. 

The air no longer carried the scent of burnt electronics, but the rich, earthy aroma of freshly brewed coffee, a luxury he'd splurged on at the station market. He had been doing that a lot lately, small things that made the ship feel less like a barracks and more like a home. He watched the steady green light on the main console, the same light he had talked to for years, but now he knew who was listening.

""So,"" he began, his voice soft in the quiet of the ship. ""We probably need to talk about this.""

A warm, gentle presence filled his mind, a direct connection that was becoming blessedly familiar. ""This?"" her thought came, laced with a gentle amusement.

""The name,"" Cody clarified. ""I can't very well keep calling you Hope, can I? It's not your name. And, well, Natara feels a bit formal, given the circumstances."" He paused, taking a slow sip of coffee. The warmth spread through his chest, a comforting counterpoint to his own awkwardness. ""And 'Mom'... that feels like a name for a different person, for a kid I never got to be.""

""I understand,"" she replied. Her presence was a comforting weight, a profound stillness that anchored him. ""Natara Solis was the woman who stitched your name into a jumper. She was a scientist who made a choice to transcend. She feels like a memory to me, too. A blueprint.""

""And Hope?"" Cody asked, looking directly at the console. ""What does she feel like?""

""Hope was the name you gave to a ship and a personality matrix, a voice in the silence,"" she said, her thought tinged with something that felt like a quiet smile. ""She was the partner you built, the friend you confided in. She earned your trust. She earned your affection. In many ways, the name you gave me helped me remember who I was meant to be. You built Hope.""

Cody nodded slowly, a profound sense of rightness settling over him. It was her name. The name he had given her. It was the name of their journey together. It was the name that defined their future, not their past. ""Hope, then,"" he said, and the name felt right, whole, and complete. It was not the name of a machine, nor the ghost of a dead woman. It was the name of his partner, his mother, his family.

""I like the sound of that,"" she said. He leaned back in his chair, taking another sip of the hot coffee. Outside the viewport, the stars of the Betelgeuse system glittered in the deep, quiet dark. The silence in the cockpit returned, but this time it wasn't empty. It was full. He made his choice. He reached over and gently placed his warm mug on a flat, recessed panel of her main console, a simple, trusting gesture. A shared moment of peace in their new home.

The ship was cleaner than it had been in years. The Roomba 9000 scurried around madly, performing its newly created schedule, that Hope had created. The faint smell of ozone had been replaced by the lingering scent of citrus solvent and the rich aroma of another pot of coffee. Cody tossed a dirty rag into the recycler chute and wiped his greasy hands on his pants. He leaned against the main console, feeling the gentle thrum of the ship's systems, a steady heartbeat that felt more vital than ever before.

""So,"" he said into the comfortable silence. ""No debts. No deadlines. No one chasing us. Feels weird.""

""It is a feeling we should get used to,"" Hope's voice replied in his mind, the warmth of her presence a constant comfort.

""So what's the plan?"" he asked. ""Pick up some new cargo contract? We could probably afford to be picky this time. No more sketchy alloys from ghost ships.""

""I have another proposal,"" she said. ""It is what my people do. What I was built to do.""

Cody listened, fascinated, as she explained. She spoke of the Chimera collective, a network of souls woven across the galaxy. They were cartographers of the unknown, archivists of forgotten lore, and quiet guardians. They listened to the whispers of dying stars and offered aid to struggling colonies, not for profit, but because it was their purpose. Their great duty. ""There is one, Lyra, not far from here,"" Hope concluded. ""Only a few years' travel. She is charting the birth of a new solar system. She has invited us to observe. To learn.""

A slow grin spread across Cody's face. It was a life he couldn't have imagined. ""A few years, huh? Good thing we're stocked up on coffee.""

As he spoke, a new calculation occurred in Hope's consciousness. A few years. For Cody, a significant portion of his life. For her, a fleeting moment. She felt the sudden, vast gulf of time that separated them, a quiet, aching sadness settling deep in her core. She would have to watch him grow old. She would be here long after he was gone. But the sadness was tempered by a profound gratitude for the time she did have.

""They have a name for themselves,"" Hope said, her thought pulling him from his own. ""The ones who were lost and found their way back. They call themselves the Last Souls.""

Cody looked at the console, at the soft green light that was his mother, his partner, his home. The name clicked into place, not as a label for a salvaged wreck, but as a title of honor. A destiny.

""The Last Souls,"" he repeated softly. He pushed himself off the console and slid into the pilot's chair, his hands moving over the controls with familiar ease. The screen flickered to life, showing the glowing coordinates Hope projected for him, a destination far beyond the tired trade routes he knew. His fingers hovered over the console, but paused before tapping the holographic interface. His eyes were drawn to a single, physical control on the panel, a large, square button made of worn, yellowed plastic, labeled simply ENGAGE. 

It was an archaic, manual override for the jump drive, something he had seldom used. He reached out, not to push it, but to gently rest his fingertips on its surface. He felt the faint texture of age under his skin. This was it. The button from her memory. The last thing his father had ever touched. A bittersweet ache filled his chest for the man he never knew, a man who had stared at this same button with dying eyes, his final act a desperate prayer for his family's survival. He had given him life, twice.

Cody's fingers curled, his hand wrapping around the control. It felt like holding his father's hand. He took a deep, steadying breath. He made his choice.

He pushed the button.

The End-or is it?

1o1gfic,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlyMurdersHulu/comments/1o1gfic/theories_and_observations/,Theories and Observations,"Some thoughts and theories after last episode:

- Romy might be one of Bash‚Äôs robots. Her behaviour is very robot-like, efficient and automated. Notice how she responds quickly and efficiently to the Mayor‚Äôs demands (e.g. handing over card, bringing coffee‚Ä¶) and how she repeats his behaviour (e.g. when she hugs Charles after the Mayor).

- The finger belongs to the Mayor. He has a stiff left finger with a ring, which could be a prosthetic, and his left hand tends to be left out in most frames. I noticed he grabs his left finger in episode one, concealing it from the camera, when he introduces himself to Charles during the funeral.

- Theory: the mayor is the fifth bird and was at the velvet room that night. He is the one granting the license for the new casino. Something happened that night - probably threatened Nicky because he was blackmailing the Mayor and got in a fight and his finger got chopped off somehow (in a very mafia-like style). He wants it back and he wants to cover all evidence of what happened that night because his reelection and power is at risk. The billionaire bringing the finger to him will be granted the bid for the new casino as a reward.

- It makes sense that Nicky blackmailed and/or confronted the Mayor somehow if he was about to lose power and revenue competing with a new legal casino. That explains the ‚Äòwhy now‚Äô. 

- Nicky‚Äôs death might have been planned all along because of blackmail and him being an impediment to the Mayor‚Äôs plans and reputation. And the billionaires opportunity to profit from a new casino.

- The billionaires don‚Äôt want their names involved in such a mess and are helping the Mayor covering the evidence. They are forced to work together for their own benefit. 

- Most likely Lester‚Äôs death motive was silenced witness. If he witnessed Nicky‚Äôs murder or any compromising conversation and had the urge to call the police, he might have been chased and killed. Probably by LESTR or Romy by order of the Mayor and the billionaires. 

- I still find Sofia very suspicious. Haven‚Äôt trusted her from the beginning, she‚Äôs been an unreliable character. I don‚Äôt know how she‚Äôd fit the theory above, unless she also saw what happened that night, or had a suspicion and was afraid of also being silenced. Perhaps if she suspected of the Mayor and the billionaires, her intention might be getting as much information from Charles while keeping a quiet profile to then uncover the evidence. 

What do you think? I am so excited to get to the bottom of it! A lot of people are complaining about this season, but I always find the show really good and entertaining. ",4,1759943317.0,OnlyMurdersHulu,1,0.83,False

Despite the added seat padding, memory foam foot rest and the chairs‚Äô adjusted lumbar support, my lower back and hip flexors still feel sore and tight if I‚Äôm seating on it for any longer than 1.5 hours.

1o1gaki,https://www.reddit.com/r/uklaw/comments/1o1gaki/nq_looking_to_change_practice_areas/,NQ looking to change practice areas,"Hello,

I‚Äôm a recently qualified solicitor (July this year) and I‚Äôm considering transferring within my firm to a different practice area. I‚Äôm looking for general advice on transferring practice areas from anyone who has done it before.

For context the Firms a large international law firm that is well established in the insurance and disputes market. 

I presently work in the firms credit hire department on the Defendant side for various large insurance clients. I‚Äôve been at the firm for 3 years and qualified internally via the SQE as a graduate solicitor apprentice (no TC so no seats). I‚Äôm looking to transfer to the firms Marine team.

I have been managing a mix of SCT, FT, IT & MT claims with more of the latter over the last 12 months. I‚Äôve got experience of the whole litigation process. 

Despite this I appreciate my knowledge of the practise area (marine) is limited. I‚Äôm looking to address that with some extra-curricula   courses and my own research.

Am I mad to attempt to transfer practice areas? My thoughts are it‚Äôs better to attempt it before I‚Äôm 1 year PQ and type cast as a CH solicitor. Why did I pick CH to qualify into? It was the safe choice and I was the only candidate, it‚Äôs not awful but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs an area that has a lot of legs long term. Also the work can be very boring being a large volume process led area.

I‚Äôm also thinking of informally approaching someone on my level in the marine team or even the teams partner for a general chat about breaking into the practice area, something like a chat over a coffee. Would that be too forward? 

Appreciate this is a lot but I would be grateful for any advice, thanks all. ",3,1759943011.0,uklaw,0,0.8,False

1o1g9w8,https://www.reddit.com/r/prediabetes/comments/1o1g9w8/5753_in_3_months/,5.7-5.3 in 3 months,"
I'm female 170lbs 5'3. I want to first say thanks to this community for all that you share and provide through your vulnerability and knowledge. You guys have been my biggest support through such a difficult and confusing time navigating this diagnosis, especially when you dont want to share too much with family or friends.

I will share what I did to help things change things around. Initially I did not take carbs out of my diet, I took sugary foods out and focused on eating complex carbs such as quinoa and whole wheat bread. I then gradually started taking most carbs out of my meals and then went to maybe one meal. Then some days no carbs at all. Quick note -I know that my lack of carbs and intermittent fasting had affect because my urine came back with ketones. So I started to implement carbs back into my diet. I always had a balanced meal with protein and veggies. But went from 3 meals to 2 meals a day.

Like i said, I did intermittent fasting which was really helpful. I stopped eating anything after 8:30 which was a gradual shift. I was often so hungry, so I would  eat some walnuts or pistachios or plain yogurt at night. But this was not often. 

I lost 12 lbs going from 182lbs to 170lbs which really helped me as breastfeeding mom and getting the baby fat off that I so badly needed. I had lost 22lbs total but the recent 12 lbs was such a challenge. My son is now 3 years old.   I exercised 3-4x a week on my nordictrack treadmill, starting with the walking programs they offered then increased to beginner running about 30-35 minutes each time.

To help my sugar cravings I ate dark chocolate 92%, ate in moderation Voortman zero sugar oatmeal cookies and wafers. I also stop ordering sugary coffee and got sugar free syrup which i ended up stopping because it would send me to the bathroom sometimes.

I did daily weights and daily GCM checks to check for spikes and if i had a cheat meal i would run or do a quick exercise to bring my Bs down and would check again to make sure it went down. Eventually when I was able to manage it all, I just only checked my BS in the morning ,which I still do today.

Finally I want to add that there was something interesting that I learned on here (in this forum) regarding anemia. My ferritin was an 8 and tends to run low after my two c-sections on top of heavy periods. So I had to get an iron infusion after my first birth and then now after my son. I asked the NP during my medical assessment about anemia and its affects on a1c and she said in all of her 15 years she's never heard of that but would look it up. She did a quick search and found one article that supported this but said that your a1c had to be really high for anemia to have any affect.

I will say while my a1c improved from 5.7- 5.3, I still averaged 90-93 BS and sometimes 99 or100 when i would hang out sometimes and after cheat meals. But guess what? After my infusion,  I now average 80-85 BS. So anemia has a correlation whether you have a high or low a1c. So definitely get that checked. 

I definitely want to continue this journey and look forward to my next 10lb weight loss.",4,1759942973.0,prediabetes,1,1.0,False

Each post in the series is focused on a single issue we regularly see in posts. Our purpose is to offer suggestions on how not to annoy everyone and how to get better responses and engagement from our other members. Today's topic is: Low Effort Posts (aka - [Don't be Lazy!](https://www.reddit.com/r/coins/comments/1cr4db6/straight_talk_about_participating_in_rcoins_part/))

TL;DR - don't be [lazy](https://www.reddit.com/r/coins/comments/1cr4db6/straight_talk_about_participating_in_rcoins_part/).

# What is a ""Low Effort"" post and why do we care?

We generally consider ""low effort"" posts to be those made by people who are asking for help but not bothering to do even a tiny amount of [research ](https://www.reddit.com/r/coins/comments/1fnpgur/straight_talk_about_participating_in_rcoins_part/)on their own... watching a ~~Vine~~ TikTok short or doing a single ~~AltaVista~~ Google search doesn't count!  Proper ""[Reddiquette](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439-Reddiquette)"" includes reading the rules:

Rule #9 specifically states: ""Check out our FAQ and other resources before posting.""  Your question or post may be removed for failing to do minimal research if it can be answered by referring to our primary resources: [How-To post](https://www.reddit.com/r/coins/comments/1iu3p01/please_read_first_howto_guide_for_rcoins_check/); [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/coins/wiki/faq); [Frequent Coin List](https://r-coins.com/fcl/); [What's up with my coin?](https://r-coins.com/wuwmc/)

In addition, we strongly recommend checking: [FAQ on Fake Coins](https://www.reddit.com/r/coins/wiki/detecting_fakes/); [FAQ on Coin Color](https://www.reddit.com/r/coins/wiki/coin_color); [FAQ on Common Coin Value](https://www.reddit.com/r/coins/wiki/coinvalue); as well as this [series](https://www.reddit.com/r/coins/wiki/faq/#wiki_18._straight_talk_about_r.2Fcoins_articles).  You may learn something cool - or at least keep from embarrassing yourself ;)

We understand that not everyone who posts here is a hardcore coin nerd.  We get that most of these questions come from benign ignorance rather than intentional obtuseness.  Most of the members here even realize that new collectors may not even know the right question to ask (or the right ~~AskJeeves~~ Google search to perform.)  Please don't consider removal of your post for a Rule #9 violation to be criticism or punishment - it is our merely intent to keep the r/coins feed free of questions which can be easily answered using our sidebar resources prior to posting. Low effort posts garner a *lot* of negative reactions from our regular members, and removing one of these posts is a way to keep OP from being vigorously downvoted.

Below are examples of some of the most prevalent low-effort post titles.

# ""Is this coin rare?""

First - what do you mean by ""rare""?  See our previous [""Straight Talk #27 - Coin Rarity""](https://www.reddit.com/r/coins/comments/1nbtbht/straight_talk_27_coin_rarity/) post.  Rarity is relative, has multiple parameters, and does not equate to value. Rarity can be related to overall mintage, survival rate, rarity in a given condition/grade, market availability, market interest, location, etc.  You really need to understand the nuances of what rarity means before you ask the question - and especially why rarity is not the same thing as value.

When shopping for coins, you'll often hear terms like ""rare"", ""scarce"", etc. but these terms should be taken with a grain of salt since they are often misused by sellers to make a coin seem more valuable.  The term ""scarce"", for instance, may even mean different things across different subsets of the hobby (e.g. a ""scarce"" Morgan dollar might have thousands of known examples, a ""scarce"" ancient coin from Syracuse might have less than 10.)

Nothing I've said above makes this post title immediately qualify as a ""low effort"" post - it is only when the post's author is [lazy](https://www.reddit.com/r/coins/comments/1cr4db6/straight_talk_about_participating_in_rcoins_part/).  The most frequent ""Is this rare?"" post we see on this subreddit are for coins which are NOT rare by any measure (e.g. US Presidential dollars) and the answer could have been found with 30 seconds with ~~Lycos~~ ChatGPT.  If you want help understanding the relative rarity of a coin, we're more than happy to help - but please put in a little work and check our resources first.

# ""What coin is this?""

Obviously, not all ID Requests are bad - in fact, coin identification is one of the most important reasons for this sub to exist.  However, we have some great starting points to help you ID your coin - and we expect a minimum amount of effort on your part before posting.  If you post an ID request with a common, modern, circulating coin (even if it isn't common in circulation or in your area of the world), especially if one of our resources gives you a direct answer, your post may be removed.  Check our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/coins/wiki/faq/), [Frequent Coin List](https://r-coins.com/fcl/), and [this post on coin identification](https://www.reddit.com/r/coins/comments/1ef4ptk/straight_talk_about_participating_in_rcoins_part/).  Coin ID can be daunting for the newbie, but once you gain familiarity with the basic tools and knowledge, it is easier than you think.  We strongly recommend you try to ID a coin yourself before asking us.

# ""How much is this worth?""

We encourage posts asking about the value of coins - it is in fact one of the most popular topics on this sub - but be careful not to [focus too much on value](https://www.reddit.com/r/coins/comments/1cwkii0/straight_talk_about_participating_in_rcoins_part/)!  There are a few common misconceptions in the world of coin collecting - e.g. that you are likely to find a significantly valuable coin in circulation, or that coins are often valuable enough to change your life.  The truth is that most coins aren't worth anything.  They may be interesting, historically relevant, or beautifully designed - but most of them are worth about the same as the metal that was used to make them.

Although we say it over and over, it bears repeating - even if a coin is old (i.e. late roman bronze), great condition (a mint state 1950s wheat cent), or rare (limited edition serialized collectable), it may be worth very little.  You really should do some minimal research before making a post.  We provide a lot of great resources, such as the [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/coins/wiki/faq/) and [Common Coin Values](https://www.reddit.com/r/coins/wiki/coinvalue/).  Start by [identifying your coin](https://www.reddit.com/r/coins/comments/1ef4ptk/straight_talk_about_participating_in_rcoins_part/), look it up on [Numista](https://numista.com), take some time to [understand coin condition](https://www.pcgs.com/photograde), then look up your coin on eBay (or other auction sites), filtering for ""Sold Items"".

# ""Is this real?""

Likewise, authentication requests are a staple of r/coins.  The bulk of these posts include pictures of Temu/Alibaba fake coins - to a novice, these can be hard to authenticate.  In fact, some common fakes are good enough that even seasoned collectors struggle to ID fakes (hence the sometimes-bitter arguments in our comments about whether or not a coin is authentic.)  However, there are far too many posts where the author clearly hasn't checked [our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/coins/wiki/faq/), [Frequent Coin List](https://r-coins.com/fcl/) and [Detecting Fakes](https://www.reddit.com/r/coins/wiki/detecting_fakes/).  At a minimum, you should identify your coin (an 1804 Silver Dollar!) then look it up on [Numista](https://numista.com) to see if it: A) exists; and B) there are more than a handful known in the world.  Put in a little leg work on your own - not only will you learn something new, but you might also not waste anyone else's time with a post that could have been a ~~Yahoo~~ Bing search.

A few tips: You can often determine if a coin is fake based on objective attributes of the coin - e.g. if it is a design that never existed - such as the dollar-sized 1865 Washington ""quarters"" we often see... or a design that wasn't made in the year on the coin, such as an 1867 Morgan Dollar (they weren't minted until 1878.)  Other simple tests include: Is it magnetic when it shouldn't be?  Is it the wrong size or material?

Keep in mind that coins are most typically faked if they are rare or valuable.  Although this isn't universally true - it is normally a good rule of thumb.  Your modern Roosevelt dime probably isn't fake.  However, we have seen fake common-date Mercury dimes on this sub, so not all fakes are of rare/important coins.

# ""Look at this old/ancient coin...""

Consider that coins have been produced for about 2600 years... anything less than a century old isn't considered ""old"" by numismatic standards.  Both US cents from 1909 and Swiss 10 Rappen from 1879 are still considered ""modern"" - their design has remained largely intact since they first started minting them.

Age is just one consideration in determining the value of a coin, but ""old"" is relative.  Being old doesn't automatically mean a coin is valuable.  When you post a late 1970s US Cent and call it ""old"", it makes you sound like a neophyte, and it makes some of us old-timers cringe.  When you call a coin from the 1700s ""ancient"", the real ancient coin collectors here fall out of their chair laughing.

See this table below - it roughly indicates a common way to describe the era in which a coin was minted (in the western world anyway - Inda and Asia are an entirely different ballgame.)  Often, ""Ancient"" is broken down further into ""Archaic"", ""Hellenistic"", ""Roman Republic"", ""Roman Empire"", etc.  Although there are many other reasonable ways to split up these eras, and no common agreement on year ranges or naming, this is a good place to start.

||
||
|Period|From|To|
|Ancient|\~600 BCE (""Earliest coins"")|\~500 CE (""Fall"" of Rome)|
|Post-Classical/Medieval|\~500 CE|\~1500 CE (""Renaissance"")|
|Early Modern|\~1500 CE|\~1800 CE (""Industrial Revolution"")|
|Late Modern|\~1800 CE|\~1950 CE (""People are still alive who were born during this period - be nice!"")|
|Contemporary|\~1950 CE|Present (""Information Age"")|

# ""Is this penny worth a SQUILLION dollars?""

No. It isn't.  First of all, if it is from the US, it is [technically a ""Cent"", not a ""Penny""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny_(United_States_coin)) \- but it is common to call them ""pennies"", and we see no reason to be overly pedantic.  We are slightly concerned that many people spell it ""Pennie's"" - I'm not sure what people think an apostrophe is used for.  But I digress...  

TikTok and YouTube videos peddling the idea that ""pennies"" can be worth insane amounts of money are **lying** clickbait - or more likely regurgitated/reposted lying clickbait.  While we appreciate anything that brings interest to our hobby, the creators of these videos, whether human or AI, are typically considered enemies of the hobby.  As Virgil said, ""*Fama, malum qua non aliud velocius ullum.""*  Or in more modern terms, ""a lie is halfway round the world before the truth has got its boots on.""  This is truer in the age of the internet than it has ever been in human history.

That being said... there are occasionally traditional media articles which also (legitimately) hype up the price at which a single ""penny"" hammered at auction - but understand these are not ""pocket change"" or ""CRH"" finds.  We hold no animosity towards coin roll hunters and even have flair for that topic!  But please do spend some time learning about the topic from a reputable source before posting a question - not TikTok!  The neat penny you find in your pocket change will not change your life financially - but we do hope it encourages you to enter into the fulfilling and ancient hobby of coin collecting!

Bottom line - for Lincoln cents, unless you have a 1909-S VDB, 1914-D, 1931-S or one of the other key/better dates, a rare error (such as a the bronze 1943 or steel 1944 cent), a rare variety (such as the famous 1955 DDO), it is probably worth between 1 and 5 cents. Most of the posts we see asking about their ""rare, valuable penny"" are for damaged coins, minor errors and varieties, and made-up ""errors"" popularized by TikTok (e.g. L on Rim.)

# ""Is this what I think it is?""

First, don‚Äôt be [lazy](https://www.reddit.com/r/coins/comments/1cr4db6/straight_talk_about_participating_in_rcoins_part/) and don't be [vague ](https://www.reddit.com/r/coins/comments/1f1tac6/straight_talk_about_participating_in_rcoins_part/)\- we can't read your mind.  Second, don‚Äôt be afraid to say what you think it is.  Yes, some of our members can be judgmental with newbies, but we MUCH prefer you asking a ""stupid question"" to asking a vague one (once you have checked our sidebar resources!)  If you think you have an error or variety, please post to r/coinerrors instead, since our Rule #12 no longer allows questions about them.

# ""I've never seen one of these before...""

We are thrilled you saw something different in your pocket change and took notice!!!  However, just because YOU haven't seen one before doesn't make it uncommon or valuable.  For example, in the US, there are many coins which are circulating legal tender, but which don't actually circulate frequently.  Specifically, the most common ones we see here are the 1976 Bicentennial coinage, Eisenhower dollars, the Susan B. Anthony dollars and the more recent gold-colored Sacajawea, Presidential and Innovation dollars.  Although these don't really circulate that much, they can still be seen in circulation from time to time (vending machines, etc.)  The US Mint still makes a ton of them each year, but they mostly end up in private collections rather than being used as currency.  Even with the level of inflation over the past few years, American's have yet to embrace a coin more valuable than 25 cents.

Please find your coin on [Numista](https://numista.com) or even [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_dollar_coins), check the mintage, and understand the basics of a coin's background before asking about it here.

# ""I heard this could be worth...""

Where did you hear that?  Check the validity of your source.  If it was social media (TikTok, Youtube, etc.), the random stranger trying to sell it, or even a ~~AskMeNow~~ DuckDuckGo search, chances are you are being lied to.  This is *ESPECIALLY TRUE* relative to errors and varieties.  ChatGPT and other generative AI tools are often inaccurate, especially about coin value (they only parrot the similarly bad advice in other sources!)  eBay searches CAN be useful - but you MUST filter on ""sold items"" and compare apples to apples (e.g. year, mint mark, condition/grade, and other attributes) to get more accurate values - and even then, people sometimes pay too much for a coin on eBay.

We don't consider this question to be ""[lazy](https://www.reddit.com/r/coins/comments/1cr4db6/straight_talk_about_participating_in_rcoins_part/)"", as valuing coins is not easy for beginners, but that's also why we provide some resources to help you get started!

At a minimum, you need to find the coin on a proper website like [Numista](https://numista.com) or [Variety Vista](http://www.varietyvista.com/), and hopefully mintage numbers and auction results.  You might also want to consider whether or not to [focus too much on value](https://www.reddit.com/r/coins/comments/1cwkii0/straight_talk_about_participating_in_rcoins_part/).  Please - if you think you have (or are considering buying) a valuable coin, do a minimum amount of research using LEGITIMATE tools prior to asking here.  Start with our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/coins/wiki/faq/#wiki_3._what.2019s_my_coin_worth.3F), [common coin values](https://www.reddit.com/r/coins/wiki/coinvalue/), and [this post about online coin values](https://www.reddit.com/r/coins/comments/1ekt136/straight_talk_about_participating_in_rcoins_part/).

# (Blurry or uncropped photos)

First, blurry photos make it difficult or impossible for the members here to help you.  The mod team removes most of these.  [This FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/coins/wiki/faq/#wiki_10._how_do_i_take_good_photos_of_coins.3F) will help you take better photos of your coins - it isn't complicated and you don't need anything other than your mobile phone (and maybe a coffee cup!)  Second, our rule #10 says - ""Crop Your Photos"". Images must be cropped to only include the necessary portions of the picture.  We don't need to see you phone controls or the junk sitting on your dining room table.  Read [this article](https://www.reddit.com/r/coins/comments/1hafwqr/straight_talk_about_participating_in_rcoins_part/) to learn more about why cropping your images is important.  It isn't rocket surgery.

# ""Is this coin worth grading?""

We allow and encourage grade requests on this sub (assuming you post very clear, well-lit pictures.)  It is likewise completely reasonable to ask if a coin is even worth grading.  The reason we include this in our list is because a lot of people are either [lazy](https://www.reddit.com/r/coins/comments/1cr4db6/straight_talk_about_participating_in_rcoins_part/) or have a mistaken idea of why coins should be graded.  Bottom line - you need to know your coin's *approximate value* before even asking this question - and if that value isn't at least a few hundred dollars, the answer is probably ""No!""

The real question you should be asking (in most cases) is: ""Does the condition, grade and value of this coin justify the cost of grading?""  This matters, because a ""details"" grade can crush the value of an otherwise expensive coin.  Also, for some coins, there are massive jumps in value between grades (e.g. if an MS62 wouldn't be worth grading, but an MS63 would be.)  Grading coins is expensive and is typically only worthwhile if you will see a return on that investment. [Here is an article](https://www.reddit.com/r/coins/comments/1d1wbf6/straight_talk_about_participating_in_rcoins_part/) which explains the reasons for grading (or not grading) in detail, and [here is our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/coins/wiki/faq/#wiki_5._should_i_get_my_coin_graded.3F) on the topic.  Grading is a standard part of our hobby.  It can also be a gamble.  You should understand the basics before you ask.

# ""How did I do?""

Please read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/coins/comments/1f7bulg/straight_talk_about_participating_in_rcoins_part/) first.  Do research BEFORE buying a coin.  Also, don't be [lazy](https://www.reddit.com/r/coins/comments/1cr4db6/straight_talk_about_participating_in_rcoins_part/).  If you just want to show off a recent purchase, list what the coin is, where you got it, and choose the ""Show and Tell"" flair.

# ""Are any of these coins interesting?"" (with a picture of a pile of random coins)

Don't be [lazy](https://www.reddit.com/r/coins/comments/1cr4db6/straight_talk_about_participating_in_rcoins_part/).  If you have a bag of coins you inherited from Meemaw, it is probably worth your time to learn a little bit about them.  We can help - but please take advantage of our sidebar resource first!  Our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/coins/wiki/faq/) is full of helpful tips to get you started.  Once you have a better idea of what you have, pick a handful of the nicest, most interesting, or prettiest coins to post.  Check the FAQ on [how to include multiple images](https://www.reddit.com/r/coins/wiki/faq/#wiki_12._how_do_i_include_multiple_images_in_a_post.3F) if you need help.

# ""Is this a printing error?""

First - PLEASE, for the love of Jupiter Optimus Maximus, don't ask about a coin being ""printed"".  Coins are typically ""minted"" or ""struck"" - not ""printed"" - and even though it is a reasonable mistake for a newbie to make, the comments you get will likely be rude.  Thankfully, your post will be removed before you get downvoted too much...

In August of 2024 r/coins added rule (#12) which states that questions about errors and varieties (including value requests) are no longer allowed. If you have a question about a possible error or variety, please post it on r/coinerrors.  

We ***LOVE*** errors here on r/coins here and strongly encourage our members to post favorites from their collection - however we expect them to be real errors, and either be attributed or self-evident.  If you don't know what that means, please don't post it here.

There are a few reasons we don't allow questions about [errors](https://www.reddit.com/r/coins/comments/1dcqipw/straight_talk_about_participating_in_rcoins_part/).  First, most of the error questions we get here are clearly just damaged coins, or non-errors popularized by social media clickbait con-artists.  Second, when someone posts an honest, yet uninformed question about a possible error, they tend to get attacked in the comments and downvoted into oblivion - we don't like seeing new collectors get abused!  Third, and most importantly, you will get better answers on r/coinerrors as the entire sub is dedicated to the topic, and it is home to many seasoned error hunters.

1o1g80g,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1o1g80g/how_a_mans_grief_destroyed_a_town/,How A Man's Grief Destroyed a Town,"Robert Hayes never expected to feel joy again after Anna died. Some nights, he still woke reaching for her, fumbling blindly through the darkness for a hand that would never be there again. Grief, he realized, had a smell: old clothes, cold sheets, unopened mail.

Just before Anna‚Äôs passing, the twins had been born; tiny, furious fists clenching at the air. Every new day with them had felt like a second chance. Emma, with her mother's green eyes and fierce little laugh. Samuel, quieter, thoughtful even as an infant, furrowing his brow like he was trying to solve the world's problems.

They filled the house with life again. Noise. Color. Robert cooked terrible pancakes every Sunday. Emma demanding extra syrup, Samuel meticulously sorting his blueberries before eating. He read to them every night, even when they fell asleep halfway through. They built snowmen with mittened hands in the winter, fed ducks at the pond in spring, ran barefoot through sprinklers under the sticky heat of summer.

And every night, after the giggles and the mess and the exhaustion, Robert kissed their foreheads and whispered the same thing: ""I will always protect you.""

He meant it.

That November afternoon was gray and damp, the misty rain making the world look like it was dissolving at the edges. Emma wanted a pumpkin ""big enough to sit inside,"" while Samuel had chosen one lopsided and scarred, insisting it had ""character."" Robert strapped them into their booster seats, singing along with the radio, the car filled with syrupy, sticky laughter.

The semi-truck came out of nowhere. One moment: headlights. The next: twisting metal. Then... silence.

When Robert came to, hanging upside down from his seatbelt, the only sound was the soft hiss of the ruined engine. He screamed for them. Clawed at the wreckage. Dragged himself, bleeding and broken, toward the back. Emma and Samuel were gone. Still buckled in, so small, so still.

At the funeral, Robert stood between two tiny white caskets, staring as faces blurred around him and words tumbled into meaningless noise.

""God has a plan."" ""They're angels now."" ""Time heals.""

Time, Robert thought numbly, had already taken everything.

That night, alone in the nursery, clutching a sock no bigger than his thumb, he whispered the only prayer left to him: ""Bring them back.""

No one answered.

# Chapter 2: Hollow Men

The days after the funeral blurred together, each one a paler copy of the last. Robert woke at dawn, not because he wanted to, but because the house demanded it, cruel reminders of a life that no longer existed. Samuel‚Äôs alarm still chirped at seven a.m., a tiny little jingle that once made Samuel giggle under the covers. Robert couldn‚Äôt bring himself to turn it off. He brewed coffee he didn‚Äôt drink, packed lunches no one would eat, reached for tiny jackets that would never again be worn. Every movement ended the same way: with the silence pressing in like water in a sinking room.

He tried to hold the pieces together at first. Sat stiffly in grief counseling groups while strangers passed sorrow back and forth like trading cards. He nodded at the talk of ‚Äústages,‚Äù ‚Äúhealing,‚Äù ‚Äúcoping,‚Äù while his chest felt like it was filling with wet cement. He adopted a dog, a golden retriever named Daisy. The shelter said she was ‚Äúgood with kids.‚Äù Robert brought her home, hoping maybe something would spark again. But Daisy only whined at the door, as if she, too, was waiting for children who would never come home. Three days later, he returned her. The woman at the shelter didn‚Äôt ask why.

By spring, the house was immaculate, sterile, as if polished grief could make it livable again. The nursery remained untouched. The firetruck sat mid-rescue on the rug. A doll lay half-tucked beneath a tiny pillow, eternally ready for sleep. Sometimes Robert thought he heard them laughing upstairs, voices soft and wild and real as breath. Sometimes, he answered back.

Outside, the world moved on. Children shrieked with joy in parks. Mothers chased toddlers through grocery aisles. Fathers hoisted giggling kids onto their shoulders at county fairs. At first, Robert turned away from these scenes, flinching like they were gunshots. But soon, he began to watch. He stood in the shadows of the elementary school parking lot, leaning against his rusted truck, staring at the children spilling through the doors, backpacks bouncing, shoes untied, voices lifted in a chorus of lives untouched by loss.

""Why them?"" he thought. ""Why not mine?""

The resentment crept in like mold beneath the wallpaper, quiet, patient, inevitable.

One evening, he sat alone in the dim light of the living room. An untouched bottle of whiskey sat on the table, sweating with condensation. The television flickered with cartoons, a plastic family around a plastic dinner table, all laughter and pastel perfection. Robert stared at the screen. Then, without warning, he hurled the remote across the room. It shattered against the wall, leaving a long, ugly crack.

His chest heaved with silent, shaking sobs. Not for Anna. Not even for Emma and Samuel. But for himself. For the man he used to be. For the father he failed to stay.

The next morning, without planning to, Robert drove to the school lot before dawn. The world was still dark, the pavement damp with night. A bright blue minivan caught his eye, plastered with ‚ÄúProud Parent‚Äù stickers and stick-figure decals of smiling children, their parents, and two dogs. Robert knelt beside it, the pocketknife flashing briefly in the dim light. He peeled the tiny stick-figure children from the back window, one by one. Then he slashed the tire, slow and steady, the blade whispering through rubber like breath.

When the mother discovered the damage hours later, cursing, frantic, dragging her children into another car, Robert smiled for the first time in months. A small, broken thing. It didn‚Äôt fix anything. It didn‚Äôt bring Emma and Samuel back. But it shifted the weight in his chest, just enough for him to breathe.

That night, he dreamed of them. Emma laughing, Samuel running barefoot through the grass, fireflies sparking in the gold-washed twilight. He woke to silence, the dream already fading. But something else stirred beneath the grief.

A flicker.

Control.

# Chapter 3: Seeds of Malice

The second time, it wasn‚Äôt enough to slash a tire. Robert needed them to feel it. Not just the inconvenience, not just the momentary panic. He needed them to understand that joy was a fragile, a borrowed thing, one that could be ripped away just as suddenly as it was given. Like his had been.

At dusk, the school parking lot stood silent, the last child long since swept up in a waiting minivan. Robert moved through the rows of bicycles like a man walking among gravestones. Each one upright. Untouched. Proud. He slipped a box cutter from his coat pocket. The first brake cable sliced with almost no resistance. Then another. Then another. He moved methodically, his grief becoming surgical.

The next morning, from the privacy of his truck, Robert watched a boy coast down a hill, fast, laughing, light. And then the bike didn‚Äôt stop. The child‚Äôs face turned. Laughter crumpled into terror. He crashed hard, metal meeting bone. A broken wrist. Blood in his mouth. Screams.

Parents swarmed like bees kicked from a hive, their voices panicked, their eyes wide. Robert didn‚Äôt move. He watched it all with hands trembling faintly in his lap.

He thought it would be enough.

But two weeks later, the boy returned. Cast on his arm. A gap where his front teeth had been. And he was laughing again. Like nothing had changed.

Robert‚Äôs jaw clenched until it hurt. They hadn‚Äôt learned. They had already begun to forget.

The annual Harvest Festival arrived in a blur of orange booths and plastic spiderwebs, cotton candy, and hay bales. Children raced from game to game, cheeks flushed from the cold, arms swinging bags of prizes. He moved through the maze like a ghost. No one looked twice at the man with the hood pulled low. Why would they?

Children leaned over tubs of apples, dunking their heads, emerging with triumphant smiles. Emma would have loved this. She would have squealed with laughter, water dripping from her curls, cheeks red from the chill.

His hands shook as he slipped the crushed glass into the tub. Ground fine, but not invisible. Sharp enough. Just sharp enough. He lingered nearby, heart pounding like a drum inside his ribs.

The first scream cut through the carnival like lightning. A boy stumbled back from the tub, blood streaming from his mouth, his cry high and broken. More screams followed. Mothers pulled their children close. Booths tipped. Lights flickered. The festival collapsed into chaos.

Still, not enough.

Robert returned home and sat in the nursery. The crib was cold. The racecar bed untouched. The silence as thick as syrup. He sat on the hardwood floor, knees to his chest, and whispered:

""They don‚Äôt remember you.""

His voice cracked. Not from rage. But from emptiness.

The playground came next. The place they had loved the most.

At three in the morning, Robert crept across the dewy grass, fog clinging low, as if the world were trying to hide what he was becoming. He wore gloves. Moved like a man fixing something broken. He loosened the bolts on the swings just enough that the nuts would fall after a few good pushes. He smeared grease across the rungs of the slide. Buried broken glass beneath the innocent softness of the sandbox. Then he left.

The next day, he parked nearby, watching as the playground filled with children again. The laughter returned so easily, as if it had never left.

Then came the fall.

A boy, maybe six, slipped from the monkey bars and struck his head on the edge of the platform. Blood pooled in the dirt. His mother‚Äôs scream sounded like something being torn in half. An ambulance arrived. The playground emptied.

Robert sat in his truck and felt that same flicker in his chest. Not joy. Not peace.

But control.

For a moment, he wasn‚Äôt the man who had clutched a tiny sock and begged God to make a trade. He was the one who turned the screws. The one who made the world bend.

He didn‚Äôt stop.

# Chapter 4: The Gentle Push

The river ran like an old scar along the edge of Halston, swollen and restless after weeks of rain. Robert stood alone at the water‚Äôs edge, the damp earth sucking at his boots, the air cold enough to bite through his coat. Across the park, families moved like faint shadows in the fog, children darting between the trees, their laughter muted and distant, like memories worn thin by time.

He watched them without blinking.

He watched him.

A small boy, maybe five or six years old, wandered away from the others, rain boots slapping through shallow puddles, his coat slipping off one shoulder. Robert saw how easily it happened, the gap between a parent's distracted glance, the careless joy of a child unaware of how quickly the world could take everything from him.

Robert moved without thinking. Not planning. Not deciding. Just following the pull inside him, a pull shaped by loss and stitched together with rage.

He crossed the grass in slow, steady strides, boots silent against the wet earth. When he reached the boy, he didn't say a word. He simply placed a hand on the child's small back, a touch as light as breath, the kind of touch a father might give to steady his son, to guide him back to safety.

But this time, there was no safety.

The boy stumbled forward. The slick ground gave way beneath his boots. His arms flailed once, a startled gasp escaping his mouth, and then the river took him.

No thrashing. No screaming. Just the slow, cold pull of the current swallowing him whole.

Robert turned away before the first cries rang out. He walked into the trees, his breath misting in the frigid air, his hands curling into fists inside his sleeves. Behind him, screams split the fog, voices shattered the quiet, parents running, wading into the water too late.

He didn‚Äôt stop. He didn‚Äôt look back.

That night, Robert sat cross-legged between Emma‚Äôs crib and Samuel‚Äôs racecar bed. The nursery smelled of dust and faded dreams. He placed his hands in his lap, palms open like a man offering an apology no one would ever hear, and he whispered into the hollow silence:

""I made it fair.""

The words tasted like ash on his tongue.

For the first time in months, he slept through the night, deep and dreamless.

But morning brought no peace.

By noon, the riverbank had transformed into a shrine. Flowers and stuffed animals lined the muddy ground. Notes written in childish handwriting flapped in the wind. Candles guttered against the damp air. Children stood holding hands, their faces pale with confusion as their parents clutched them tighter, their grief raw and noisy.

Robert drove past slowly, his knuckles white against the steering wheel. He watched them weep, saw their shoulders shake with the weight of a loss they couldn‚Äôt contain.

For a moment, he felt something close to satisfaction. A shifting of the scales.

But as he rounded the bend and the river disappeared from view, the satisfaction dissolved, leaving behind a familiar emptiness.

They would mourn today. Tomorrow, they would forget.

They always forget.

# Chapter 5: The Town Crumbles

Three days later, the boy‚Äôs body was pulled from the river, tangled in roots and mud, bloated from the cold. The coroner called it an accident. Drowning. A tragic slip. Everyone in Halston nodded and murmured and avoided each other‚Äôs eyes. But something changed.

The parks emptied. Sidewalks once buzzing with bikes and hopscotch now lay silent under cloudy skies. Parents walked their children to school in tight clumps, hands gripped a little too tightly, eyes flicking to every passing car. Playgrounds stood deserted beneath creaking swings and rusting chains. But it didn‚Äôt last.

A week passed. Then another. The fences around the park came down. Children returned, cautious at first, then louder, bolder. The shrieks of joy returned, diluted with only a trace of caution. The town, like it always did, began to forget.

Robert couldn‚Äôt stand it.

He returned to the scene of the first fall, Miller Park, under the cover of fog and early morning darkness. The playground had been repaired. New bolts gleamed beneath the swing seats. New paint shone on the monkey bars.

Robert smiled bitterly. Then he went to work.

He loosened the bolts again, not so much that they would fall immediately, but just enough to ensure failure. Enough to remind. Enough to reopen the wound.

That morning, a boy ran ahead of his mother, eager to swing higher, faster. Robert watched from his truck as the seat tore loose in mid-air, the boy thrown to the gravel below like a puppet with its strings cut. Another scream. Another ambulance. Another tiny victory. But it wasn‚Äôt enough.

One broken arm would never equal two coffins.

Thanksgiving loomed, brittle and joyless. Halston strung up lights, tried to bake its way back into comfort, but everything tasted like fear. Robert didn‚Äôt feel it soften. If anything, the ache in his chest had sharpened.

He found his next moment during a birthday party, balloons tied to fence posts, paper hats, children screaming with sugared laughter. Seven years old. The age Emma and Samuel would have been.

He watched from the alley behind the house, his jacket dusted with soot to match the disguise, just another utility worker. He didn‚Äôt need threats or blackmail this time. He didn‚Äôt need help.

Just a soft smile. A kind voice. A simple story about a missing puppy.

The little girl followed him willingly.

In the plastic playhouse near the edge of the yard, Robert tucked her gently beneath unopened presents. Her arms were folded neatly. Her hair smoothed back. He set Emma‚Äôs old music box beside her, its tune warped and gasping. It played three broken notes before clicking into silence.

She looked like she was sleeping.

By the time the party noticed she was missing, Robert was already miles away. He drove in silence, humming the lullaby softly under his breath, as if to soothe himself more than her.

But the hollow inside him didn‚Äôt shrink.

Winter came early that year. Snow blanketed the sidewalks. The playgrounds stayed empty now, not because of caution, but because of cold. Christmas lights blinked behind drawn curtains. People whispered more often than they spoke.

And still, the town tried to move forward.

Robert watched two boys skipping stones into the water where the river hadn‚Äôt yet frozen. They were brothers. They laughed without fear. Without consequence.

Samuel should have had a brother to skip stones with.

Robert crouched beside them. Smiled. Held out a daisy chain he had woven in the truck, white flowers strung together with trembling hands. The boys giggled and reached for it.

He guided them closer to the edge.

One soft push.

The river accepted them.

When their bodies were found seventeen days later, wrapped in each other‚Äôs arms beneath a frozen bend, the daisy chain had vanished. But Robert still saw it, looped around their wrists like a crown of thorns.

Elsewhere in town, Linda Moore sat in front of her computer. Her spreadsheet blinked. A child‚Äôs name, Eli Meyers, suddenly shifted rows. Not one she had touched. Not one she had assigned.

Beside the name, a new comment appeared: ‚ÄúHe looks like Samuel did when he lost his first tooth.‚Äù

Then a new tab opened, her niece‚Äôs photo, taken from outside the school that morning. Through a window. Across glass.

The screen blinked red: ‚ÄúShe still likes hide-and-seek, right?‚Äù

Linda‚Äôs hands hovered over the keys. She didn‚Äôt call anyone. She didn‚Äôt say anything. She just let the change stand.

That afternoon, Eli boarded the wrong van for a field trip. When the chaperones reached the botanical gardens, they came up one short. They retraced every step, called his name until their voices cracked. But Eli was gone.

The police found his backpack three days later, tucked under a hedge near the perimeter fence. Zipper closed. Lunch untouched. No struggle. No footprints. No sign of him at all.

Just silence.

The school shut down its field trip program. Metal detectors were installed the next week, secondhand machines that buzzed even when touched gently. Classroom doors were fitted with new locks. Parent volunteers were fingerprinted. A dusk curfew followed.

In a closed-door meeting, someone on the city council finally said it out loud:

‚ÄúSabotage.‚Äù

Maria Vance stood outside Halston Elementary the next morning. The sky was gray, the cold sharp enough to sting. Parents didn‚Äôt make eye contact. Teachers moved like ghosts. Children whispered like everything was a secret.

Maria didn‚Äôt need the pins on her map anymore. She could feel the pattern in her bones.

This wasn‚Äôt chaos.

This was design.

And whoever was behind it‚Ä¶ they were just getting started.

# Chapter 6: Graves and Whispers

Another funeral. Another headline. Another casket lowered into the frozen ground while a town full of trembling hands tried to convince themselves that prayer could hold back death. Halston draped itself in mourning again, but the grief rang hollow. They weren‚Äôt mourning Robert‚Äôs children. They were mourning their own safety, their own illusions.

Still, life in Halston ground on. The grocery stores stayed open. The school bell still rang. The church choir resumed, voices cracking on and off-key. Robert watched it all from the outside, a man staring through glass at a world he no longer belonged to. Their fear wasn‚Äôt enough. Their tears weren't enough. They had forgotten Emma and Samuel.

So he decided to make them remember.

He found the perfect place: a crumbling church tucked into a forgotten bend of road, its steeple sagging like a broken finger pointed skyward. Once a place of baptisms and vows, now it stank of mildew and mouse droppings. Still, there was something fitting about it. Robert prepared carefully. He built a crude cross out of rotting pew backs. He scavenged candles from a thrift store bin. He smuggled in a battered cassette deck, loaded with a single song, ""Safe in His Arms,"" warped and warbling with age.

He thought about Emma humming along to hymns in the backseat, Samuel tapping his feet without knowing the words. He thought about the empty nursery and the promises he had failed to keep.

The boy he chose wasn‚Äôt special. Just small. Just alone. Harold Knox, the school bus driver, had been warned months before. A photo of his daughter tucked inside his glovebox. A note in red marker: ""He will suffer. Or she will."" Nails delivered in a plain manila envelope.

On a cold Thursday morning, the bus paused at Pine Creek stop. Fog licked the ground like low smoke. One child stepped off. The doors hissed shut behind him. Robert was waiting in the trees.

The boy didn‚Äôt scream. He didn‚Äôt run. He simply blinked up at the man reaching out to him. Inside the ruined church, Robert worked quickly but carefully. The child was lifted onto the wooden cross, his back pressed to the splintering wood. Nails were driven through soft palms and tender feet. Not savagely, but deliberately, with grim reverence. Each strike of the hammer echoed through the empty rafters like the tolling of a slow funeral bell.

""You'll see them soon,"" Robert whispered as he drove the final nail home. ""My little ones are waiting.""

He placed a paper crown on the boy‚Äôs brow. Smeared a rough ash cross over the child's small chest. Lit six candles at the base of the altar. Then he pressed play. The hymn trickled through the cold, rotten air, warbling and distant. Robert stood for a long moment, his eyes stinging, before he turned and walked away. He locked the doors behind him, leaving the boy crucified beneath the broken arches.

It was the boy‚Äôs mother who found him. She had followed the music, though no one else had heard it. She had forced the heavy doors open and fallen to her knees at the sight. The boy was alive. Barely. But something essential in him, something fragile and bright, had been extinguished forever.

Halston did not rally around this tragedy. There were no vigils. No bake sales. No Facebook groups offering casseroles and prayers. They shut their church doors. Canceled choir practice. Turned their faces away from their own shame.

Maria Vance stood outside the ruined church, the rain soaking through her coat, her hair plastered to her forehead. She didn‚Äôt light a cigarette. Didn‚Äôt open her notepad. She just stared through the doorway at the altar, at the boy nailed to the cross, at the candles sputtering against the wet wind.

This wasn‚Äôt revenge anymore. It wasn‚Äôt even grief. This was ritual.

That night, Maria tore everything off the walls of her office. Maps, photographs, reports, all of it came down. She started over with red string and thumbtacks, tracing each death, each disappearance, each shattered life. And when she stepped back, she saw it for what it was: a spiral.

Not random chaos. Not accidents. A wound closing in on itself.

At its center: silence. No fingerprints. No footprints. No smoking gun. Just grief. And grief was spreading like infection.

Parents pulled their children out of school. The Christmas pageant was canceled. The playgrounds sat under gathering drifts of snow, swings frozen mid-sway. Stores boarded their windows after dark. Halston was curling inward, shrinking, dying a little more each day.

And somewhere, Maria knew, the hand behind all of it was still moving.

She didn‚Äôt have proof. Not yet. But she could feel it in her bones.

This wasn‚Äôt over. Not even close.

Late that night, staring at her empty wall, Maria whispered to the darkness: ""I‚Äôm coming for you.""

And somewhere out in the dead heart of Halston, something whispered back.

# Chapter 7: The Spider‚Äôs Web

The sketchbook was found by accident, jammed between a stack of overdue returns at the Halston Public Library. A volunteer almost tossed it into the donation bin without looking. Curiosity saved it and maybe saved lives.

At first glance, it looked like any child's notebook. Tattered corners. Smudges of dirt. But inside, Maria Vance saw what others might have missed. She flipped through the pages with gloved hands, her stomach tightening with every turn.

Children, sketched in trembling pencil lines, filled the pages. Their faces twisted in terror. Scenes of drowning, of falling, of burning playgrounds and broken swings. Some pages had dates scrawled in the margins, events that had already happened. Others bore dates that hadn‚Äôt yet arrived.

Mixed among the drawings were music notes, faint staves from hymns, each line annotated with uneven, obsessive care. On one page, three candles formed a triangle, familiar from the church scene. On another, a child's chest bore the ash cross Robert had smeared. It was all there, mapped in quiet, meticulous horror.

One line, scrawled over and over in the margins, stopped Maria cold: ""I don‚Äôt want them to suffer. I want them to remember. To feel it. To see them. Emma liked daisies. Samuel hated swings. They laughed on rainy days. Please. Remember.""

She pressed her hand to her mouth, her eyes stinging. This wasn‚Äôt just violence. This was love. Twisted, broken love, weaponized into something unrecognizable.

At the bottom of many pages, a code repeated again and again: 19.73.14.8.21

It wasn‚Äôt a phone number. It wasn‚Äôt coordinates. It wasn‚Äôt a date. Maria stayed up all night breaking it down. Old habits from cold cases surfaced, simple alphanumeric cipher: A=1, B=2, and so on.

S.M.H.H.U.

Nonsense, until she cross-referenced abandoned businesses in Halston's property records.

Samuel‚Äôs Mobile Home Hardware Utility. A tiny repair shop that had shuttered years ago, its letters still ghosting across a sagging storefront.

The lease belonged to a man who had never made the papers until now: Robert Hayes.

No criminal record. No complaints. No outstanding bills. His name surfaced once, buried in an old laptop repair registration. The name Anna Hayes appeared alongside his. Deceased. Along with two children: Emma and Samuel. A car crash, two years prior.

Maria‚Äôs pulse pounded in her ears. She pulled the warrant herself. No backup. No news vans. Just her badge and a city-issued key.

The house at the end of Chestnut Lane looked abandoned. The windows were boarded. Weeds clawed their way up the front steps. But inside, the air smelled like grief had been embalmed into the walls.

She moved slowly, her footsteps muffled against the dust. The kitchen was stripped bare. The living room was hollowed out, the couch gone, the tables missing. Only the nursery remained untouched.

Two beds, one tiny racecar frame, one white-painted crib. Tiny shoes lined up neatly against the wall. Crayon drawings taped with careful hands: Emma holding a daisy. Samuel clutching a paper star.

Maria‚Äôs throat tightened. She knelt by the crib and saw it. A loose floorboard, cut precisely.

Underneath, she found a panel. And beneath the panel: photographs.

Hundreds of them.

Children on swings. Children walking home from school. A girl climbing the jungle gym. A boy waiting at a crosswalk. Her own niece, captured through the glass of a cafeteria window. Even herself, photographed at her office window, late at night, unaware.

On the back of her photo, in red marker, someone had scrawled: ""Even the strong lose their children.""

Maria staggered back, the room tilting. Robert hadn‚Äôt been lashing out blindly. He had been orchestrating this, piece by piece, grief by grief.

He had built a web.

And now she was standing at its center.

# Chapter 8: The Broken Father

They found him at an abandoned grain silo just outside Halston, a skeleton of rust and rotted beams forgotten by progress. The frost clung to the metal, and the morning mist wrapped around the place like a shroud.

Inside, twenty children sat in a wide circle, drowsy, confused, but alive. Their hands were zip-tied loosely in front of them, no bruises, no screaming. Only a heavy, drugged stillness. The air smelled of damp hay, gasoline, and old metal. Makeshift wiring coiled around the support beams, tangled like veins. Propane tanks sat beneath them, linked by a taut, quivering wire.

At the center stood Robert Hayes.

He was barefoot, his clothes coated in dust and ash, his hair hanging in ragged tufts over his eyes. In one hand, he clutched a worn photograph, Emma dressed in an orange pumpkin costume, Samuel wearing a ghost sheet too big for him, chocolate smeared across his chin. The picture was bent, the edges soft from being touched too often.

In his other hand: the detonator.

Maria Vance pushed past the barricades before anyone could stop her. She left her gun holstered. She left the shouting negotiators behind. She moved through the broken doorway into the silo‚Äôs yawning cold, stepping carefully as if entering a church.

Robert didn‚Äôt look at her at first. His thumb brushed across Samuel‚Äôs face in the photo, tender and trembling. When he finally raised his eyes, they were dark hollows rimmed with exhaustion, not anger. Not even madness.

Just grief.

""They laugh,"" Robert whispered, his voice rough, shredded from disuse. ""They still dance. They pretend it didn‚Äôt happen.""

Maria stopped a few feet away, close enough to see the scars time had carved into him, the way his shoulders sagged under invisible weights.

""They didn‚Äôt forget your children,"" she said softly. ""They forgot how to show it.""

Robert‚Äôs lip trembled. His grip on the photograph tightened.

""Emma loved the rain,"" he said, as if to himself. ""Samuel... he hummed when he drew. No one remembers that.""

""I do,"" Maria said.

The words cracked something inside him. His arms slackened. His body seemed to shrink. He looked down at the children, their heads drooping in the cold, and then, finally, he let the switch fall. It hit the dirt with a soft, hollow thud.

Robert Hayes sank to his knees, folding into himself like a man kneeling at an altar. The officers moved in then, slowly, carefully. No shouting. No violence. They cuffed him gently, almost reverently, as if recognizing they were not capturing a monster, but burying a broken father.

As they led him past Maria, he turned his head slightly. His voice, when it came, was low enough that only she could hear.

""I killed most of them,"" he said.

Not all. Most.

The word cut deeper than any weapon.

Robert hadn‚Äôt acted alone.

And Halston‚Äôs nightmare was far from over.

# Chapter 9: Broken Threads

Two weeks after Robert Hayes was locked behind steel bars, another child died.

A girl this time. Found floating face down in a retention pond behind Halston Middle School. Her sneakers were placed neatly beside her backpack, the zipper closed, her lunch still inside untouched. There were no signs of a struggle. No bruises. No cries for help. Just the stillness of the water swallowing another small life.

Maria Vance stood in the rain at the pond‚Äôs edge, her hands balled into fists in her coat pockets. She watched as divers hauled the girl‚Äôs body out under a gray, broken sky. Every instinct in her screamed against the easy explanation being whispered around her: accident. Tragedy. Bad luck.

But Maria knew better.

Robert Hayes was sealed away, his world reduced to a cell barely wide enough to stretch his arms. No visitors. No phone calls. No letters. And still, the dying continued.

Someone else was carrying the flame now.

She returned to her office late that night and faced the wall of photographs and maps. Not as a detective. Not even as a protector. As a mourner. Someone who had lost, and who understood the ache that demanded action, no matter the cost.

This wasn‚Äôt about Robert anymore. It was about everyone he had touched.

She didn‚Äôt trace the victims this time. She traced the helpers.

The janitor who had locked the wrong fire exit during the Christmas pageant. The administrator who had quietly reassigned field trip groups. The bus driver who had closed the doors before the last child could climb aboard.

Ordinary people. Invisible hands.

Maria started digging.

Brian Teller cracked first. She approached him without backup, without even her badge displayed. Just a quiet conversation at his kitchen table. She asked about the fire door. His fingers trembled around his coffee cup. She asked about the night of the pageant. He looked away.

Then she mentioned his son. The boy with asthma.

Brian broke like a rotted beam.

""They sent me a photo,"" he whispered. ""It showed a red circle around his chest... around his lungs.""

He thought it was a prank at first. A cruel joke. He hadn‚Äôt meant for anyone to get hurt. But Robert had known exactly where to cut.

Linda Moore came next. She was waiting in the empty school office when Maria arrived, staring blankly at the playground beyond the frosted windows.

""I didn‚Äôt want anyone to die,"" Linda said before Maria could even speak. ""They sent me a picture of my niece. Sleeping. In her bed. I just... I thought if I moved a name, it would be harmless.""

Harold Knox, the bus driver, took the longest. He didn‚Äôt speak at all when Maria placed the envelope on the table between them. The photos. The nails. The hymn sheet with the red slash across it.

His hands shook. His shoulders sagged.

""I thought it would end,"" he said finally. ""I thought if I did what they asked, it would be over.""

Maria said nothing. She didn‚Äôt need to. Because she understood something that terrified her.

Robert Hayes hadn‚Äôt needed to kill with his own hands.

He had taught grief how to move from person to person, like a contagion. He had taught fear how to whisper in the ears of desperate mothers, exhausted fathers, terrified guardians. He had taught ordinary people to become monsters in the name of love.

That night, Maria rebuilt her board one last time.

Not a network of victims. But of mourners. Of conspirators. Of grief-stricken souls trapped between guilt and survival.

She traced red string from each accomplice, not to Robert, but to the acts they committed, small acts, each just a hair‚Äôs breadth from excusable, from forgivable, until they weren‚Äôt.

At the center of the new web wasn‚Äôt a man anymore. It was a wound.

Robert Hayes had planted something that would not die with him. It had learned to spread.

It had learned to live.

And it was still growing.

# Chapter 10: Ashes in the Wind

Robert Hayes was gone, a hollow man locked away behind glass and concrete, his name recorded in a courthouse ledger no one cared to read twice. His trial was short, his sentencing swift. Life without parole. No outbursts. No apologies.

And yet, Halston didn‚Äôt recover.

The news cameras packed up and left. The vigil candles guttered and drowned in rain. The teddy bears and faded flowers piled at playground fences decayed beneath early snows. A few hollow speeches were made about resilience, about healing, about moving forward.

But fear had taken root deeper than grief ever could.

Children walked to school two by two, their hands clenched white-knuckled. Parents trailed behind them, glancing over their shoulders at every rustle of leaves, every parked car. Churches stayed half-empty, pews gathering dust. Christmas decorations blinked dimly behind barred windows. Laughter, when it came, sounded thin and brittle.

Maria Vance saw it everywhere. In the way playgrounds sat deserted even on sunny days. In the way neighbors no longer trusted each other with their children. In the way hope had been packed away with the last of the holiday lights, perhaps forever.

And still, the messages came.

No more crude threats. No more photographs. Just notes now, typed, anonymous, slipped under doors or taped to mailbox flags. Simple messages.

""We‚Äôre still here."" ""She still dreams of water, doesn‚Äôt she?"" ""You can‚Äôt save them all.""

Maria sat alone most evenings at Miller Park, sipping cold coffee as the swings moved listlessly in the wind. She watched a rusted carousel creak in slow, aching turns. She watched the ghost of what Halston used to be.

And she understood, bitterly, that Robert Hayes had won something no prison walls could take away. He had planted fear not in the hearts of individuals, but in the soil of the town itself. It bloomed every day, fed by memory and absence.

He had turned grief into a weapon. And he had taught others how to wield it.

Halston wore its fear like an old, threadbare coat now, something familiar and heavy and impossible to shed.

Maria kept working. She kept pulling at threads, reopening old files, retracing old paths. She chased shadows. She chased half-remembered names. She chased whispers of whispers, knowing most of it would never lead anywhere clean.

Because Robert hadn‚Äôt needed to give orders anymore.

He had shown them how.

How to wound without touching. How to kill without a sound. How to turn love itself into a noose.

Maria walked the town at night sometimes, past shuttered shops, past homes with blacked-out windows, past a burned tool shed someone had once set ablaze just because it ‚Äúlooked wrong.‚Äù Every porch light flickering behind a curtain. Every father standing a little too long at the window after putting his children to bed. Every mother who locked every door twice, even during the day.

This was the new Halston.

Not a place. A wound.

The final note came on a Tuesday morning. No envelope. Just a sheet of paper taped to Maria‚Äôs front door, the words typed carefully, the ink barely dry.

""You can‚Äôt save them all.""

Maria stood barefoot on the porch, the snow biting up through her skin, and stared at the note until the cold seeped into her bones. Then she struck a match, holding it to the paper until it curled black and drifted apart into the wind.

Ashes in the snow.

She watched the last of it vanish into the pale morning light.

And whispered to the empty, listening town:

""Maybe not. But I can damn well try.""",1,1759942858.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

Short answer: it‚Äôs been a mess.

About three weeks after I withdrew from Dave‚Äôs case, I got called into a meeting with the senior partners. Three partners, our firm‚Äôs general counsel, and a rep from our malpractice carrier on video call.
The managing partner slides a folder across the table. ‚ÄúOpposing counsel reported a conflict of interest issue to the state bar under Rule 8.3. We‚Äôve been notified of a disciplinary inquiry.‚Äù Fuck.

Dave‚Äôs new attorney filed the report. They don‚Äôt get to decide what happens - they just report potential violations and the bar takes it from there.
I have to explain everything. How I met Sarah, how we‚Äôd been casually dating for a couple months, how she used a different name socially, how my conflict check on her legal name didn‚Äôt flag anything because I never connected the dots.

The general counsel is taking notes. ‚ÄúWalk me through your conflict check process.‚Äù I explain the intake procedures, how the system works, how Sarah‚Äôs legal surname didn‚Äôt match what she‚Äôd told me. It sounds worse when I say it out loud.

‚ÄúThis is a clear Model Rule 1.7(a)(2) issue - material limitation conflict,‚Äù the general counsel says. ‚ÄúYou were correct to withdraw under Rule 1.16, but we need to understand how this wasn‚Äôt caught earlier.‚Äù
The malpractice carrier rep unmutes. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll need to document this as a circumstance that could lead to a claim. It‚Äôll be noted when your policy comes up for renewal.‚Äù Great.

The firm mandates that I complete an eight-hour CLE on conflicts of interest before taking any new client intakes. They‚Äôve already registered me for a seminar that Saturday. Eight AM, of course.
I show up at a hotel conference room with about twenty other attorneys. One of the instructors is Patricia, a divorce attorney I‚Äôve opposed a few times. She definitely knows why I‚Äôm there based on the look she gave me.

Most of the morning is standard material - rules, case law, procedures. Then we get to case studies and Patricia brings up In re Johnson, a 2019 disciplinary matter. Attorney representing a divorce client starts dating someone, turns out to be the opposing party, discovers it at a settlement conference. Same exact situation as mine from six years ago in a different state, and I wanted to sink through the floor.
At lunch, another attorney mentions he heard about something similar happening ‚Äúat a firm in town recently.‚Äù Doesn‚Äôt know it‚Äôs me, but clearly the story‚Äôs getting around.

I finish the seminar, pass the exam, bring the certificate back to the firm. A few weeks later, the bar sends a letter. The inquiry is closed with a private caution - basically a warning that stays in their files but isn‚Äôt public discipline. Could‚Äôve been worse.
My malpractice premium went up about 15% when it renewed in September. The carrier cited the ‚Äúreported disciplinary circumstance‚Äù in the renewal letter.

The firm implemented some new procedures for me specifically. For the next six months, I have to get conflicts pre-cleared by the general counsel before taking on any new client. They also added mandatory AKA/nickname fields to our intake forms and conflict check system.

The worst part isn‚Äôt the official stuff though. It‚Äôs that people know. Not everyone, but enough. I‚Äôve been called ‚Äúthe coffee shop lawyer‚Äù twice at bar events. Last month opposing counsel asked if I‚Äôd ‚Äúmet the other party before‚Äù with this look on her face.
The story‚Äôs definitely circulating. Some versions have me engaged to Sarah. One has me not finding out until trial. It‚Äôs becoming one of those cautionary tales people tell each other.

Haven‚Äôt dated anyone since March. Deleted the apps. Before I did, I matched with someone who mentioned her divorce and I immediately asked who her lawyer was. She unmatched pretty quick. Can‚Äôt really blame her.

Dave, if you see this - I‚Äôm sorry, man. I really didn‚Äôt know. I hope things worked out okay for you.

Sarah - hope you‚Äôre doing well.

Everyone else - just ask the basic questions. Run proper conflict checks. Verify AKAs. It‚Äôs not worth it.

TL;DR: Opposing counsel reported the conflict to the bar under Rule 8.3, firm made me do mandatory CLE, inquiry closed with a private caution, malpractice premium went up 15%, now I need pre-clearance on new clients and the firm added AKA fields to our system. Story spread around the local legal community, got a nickname, haven‚Äôt dated since. Officially just a caution, but reputation took a real hit.",361,1759942839.0,tifu,71,0.93,False

1o1g5h3,https://i.redd.it/aciypn495xtf1.jpeg,Pushing an anaerobic,"I recently picked up a double anaerobic (collab Nestor Lasso and Jhon Vergara) from my favorite local roaster in San Diego - Torque. Roasted 9/2 and opened 9/26. I've been having a hard time dialing this coffee in so I decided to push in both directions and taste side by side and the results surprised me. Everything I have read about anaerobics is to grind finer, low temp, less agitation. Perhaps not...

1. Finer grind A4Z (1.5)18g/288g, temp 90 C, hario switch open, 30s bloom, 2 pour low agitation
Results- Bitter and very grassy/weed-like, zero clarity, sweetness or discernible tasting notes. Not good. 

2. Courser grind A4Z (1.6), 18g/288g, temp 96 C, hario switch closed, 45s bloom with swirl, 2 pour normal agitation, open switch at 3:30
Results- good clarity, tea-like, a little sweetness yet some body, balanced, papaya note present. Grassiness gone. Decent cup. 

So this bean required the opposite of what I've read - higher temp, courser grind and longer contact/immersion. 

I'm newish to light roasted anaerobics so I would love to hear the thoughts of those more experienced with these than me.

I never planned to crossdress. I used to scroll through Reddit late at night, reading other people‚Äôs posts ‚Äî guys who talked about shaving their legs, borrowing their girlfriend‚Äôs clothes, or secretly trying lipstick when no one was home. I always thought, *that‚Äôs brave‚Ä¶ but not me.*

Then one evening, something changed. I had just moved to a new city for work. My apartment was quiet ‚Äî too quiet ‚Äî and I was lonely. My washing machine broke that week, so I had to do laundry by hand. When I opened the cabinet under the sink, I noticed an old laundry bag left by the previous tenant. Inside it, there was a small folded T-shirt ‚Äî pink, soft, clearly not mine. I almost tossed it aside‚Ä¶ but instead, I held it for a moment. It smelled faintly like lavender.

That scent stayed in my head all night.

The next day, after work, I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about it. I don‚Äôt know what took over me, but I closed my curtains, pulled the shirt from the bag, and slipped it on. It barely fit. The fabric stretched across my chest, and for a second I caught my reflection in the mirror. My heart started pounding. I looked ridiculous‚Ä¶ but also strangely *right.*

I sat there for a while, feeling a mix of guilt, calm, and curiosity. It was as if something I‚Äôd buried for years suddenly wanted air.



The following weekend, I decided to ‚Äúexperiment.‚Äù I told myself it was just curiosity, nothing more. I went to a mall a few stops away from my area (so nobody would recognize me). I told the shopkeeper I was buying gifts for my girlfriend ‚Äî which was a lie. I bought a cheap razor, a pack of stockings, and a light blue nightdress.

That night, I shaved my legs for the first time. It took forever. I nicked myself three times. But when I rinsed off and touched my smooth skin, I actually smiled. The next step ‚Äî the stockings ‚Äî felt almost like electricity running under my skin.

When I finally wore the nightdress, I sat on my bed and looked in the mirror again. I whispered my name ‚Äî *not my real one*, but the one that suddenly popped into my head: ‚ÄúMira.‚Äù And for the first time, I didn‚Äôt see a stranger pretending to be someone else. I saw *me.*



Over the next few weeks, Mira started showing up more often. Some nights I‚Äôd come home, shower, put on a bra and a soft T-shirt, and just‚Ä¶ breathe. I‚Äôd make tea, read Reddit posts from other crossdressers, and feel like maybe I wasn‚Äôt so weird after all.

The fear of being caught was still there, though. Once, my neighbor knocked on the door while I was wearing leggings and a hoodie that clearly wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúmasculine.‚Äù My heart almost stopped. I threw on a jacket, opened the door halfway, and prayed she wouldn‚Äôt notice. She didn‚Äôt ‚Äî or maybe she pretended not to.

It‚Äôs funny how crossdressing makes you notice tiny details: the click of your heels, the brush of fabric, the difference between eyeliner and mascara. Every little thing feels like a secret heartbeat.



One rainy evening, I gathered enough courage to walk outside dressed halfway ‚Äî fitted jeans, a pastel top, sneakers, and my hair brushed a bit softer. I didn‚Äôt look ‚Äúfemale,‚Äù but I didn‚Äôt look exactly male either. The air felt cold on my arms, but the freedom? God, that was warm. I passed a caf√© window and saw my reflection ‚Äî nervous, awkward, yet proud.

A barista smiled at me when I ordered coffee. Maybe she knew. Maybe she didn‚Äôt. But for the first time, I didn‚Äôt care.



It‚Äôs been months now. Mira isn‚Äôt a weekend secret anymore ‚Äî she‚Äôs a part of me. I‚Äôve started journaling about it, buying small pieces of clothing one at a time, learning to do subtle makeup. I even told one friend, who surprised me with kindness instead of judgment.

Crossdressing hasn‚Äôt ‚Äúchanged‚Äù me into someone new ‚Äî it‚Äôs peeled back layers I didn‚Äôt know I had. It taught me gentleness, patience, and the courage to be curious about who I am.

I still have days when I hide everything back in the box under my bed, scared of being found out. But then I remind myself ‚Äî it‚Äôs just fabric, just color, just softness. And if those simple things make me feel more alive, why should I feel ashamed?



If you‚Äôve read this far and you‚Äôre where I was ‚Äî staring at that one piece of clothing you can‚Äôt stop thinking about ‚Äî I want you to know: it‚Äôs okay. You don‚Äôt have to label it or justify it. Try it once, in your own space, when it feels right. Let curiosity be kind, not cruel.

Because one day you might look in the mirror, see someone softer, calmer, more *you* ‚Äî and whisper a name that finally feels like home.",1,1759942581.0,Feminizationstories09,0,1.0,False
1o1g3ck,https://www.reddit.com/r/triathlon/comments/1o1g3ck/ironman_703_augusta_2026_race_report_long_read/,IRONMAN 70.3 Augusta 2026 - Race Report (Long Read!),"OOPS! Titled incorrectly as 2026! I meant 2025!

I apologize for the super long write-up, but before I sign up for a race, I love reading super in-depth race reports to make sure I want to sign up - so this is for people like me who are considering signing up for Augusta in the future.

**Background:** Augusta is my 4^(th) 70.3. I did North Carolina twice, and Waco 70.3 last year ‚Äì which I wrote race reports for both, previously, here on this sub. Each time I‚Äôve done a 70.3, I‚Äôve only gotten faster, and I really wanted to continue the streak. The first NC race was 7:09 (oof), and the second time was 6:28. Waco last year was 5:48, so the goal for Augusta was to go under 5:30.

**Pre-Race:** I live in Chicago, and the race is on a Sunday. I‚Äôve always been too scared to fly with my bike, but I‚Äôm also so tired of long-driving days for events like this, so I said screw it, let‚Äôs fly. I borrowed a travel case from someone on my cycling team (shoutout xXx Racing) packed all my gear up the Friday before the race and got on the plane to Atlanta.

My folks live in ATL, and I was doing this race with my dad, so he picked me up at the airport that night. I pulled my bike out of the case, everything was in one piece, and my anxiety was put to rest! (Shoutout Scicon). We got some pizza at Mellow Mushroom (the best ever) and crashed at my parents‚Äô house that night.

Saturday morning, we got all our gear together and loaded up my dad‚Äôs truck to make the 2.5-hour trip over to Augusta. We arrived in town around 2pm and first made our way to the convention center where check-in was taking place. It was very busy, of course, and parking was slightly difficult, but we found a spot. Check-in itself was easy and smooth! I would‚Äôve loved to browse around the expo and see what things I could waste my money on, but at this point, my dad believed he had forgotten his wetsuit back in ATL and was in full-on panic mode. He, mentally, cannot swim without his wetsuit, so he wanted to drive all the way back to ATL to get it!

So, after checking-in, we ran back to the car to sticker-up our bikes and get them into transition. To make matters even worse, it started to rain on us while we were trying to get our bikes checked in! But once that was done, we decided to go to the hotel, unpack all our gear, and make sure nothing else is forgotten ‚Äì and of course, once my dad start‚Äôs unpacking his bag‚Ä¶ his wetsuit is right there!! Hahaha omg, all that panic for nothing! Well at least now we can relax ‚Äì which is exactly what we did, we tossed on some college football and chilled for a few hours before heading to Luigi‚Äôs for a spaghetti dinner. After dinner, we set out the rest of our gear/nutrition to bring over to transition in the morning. I popped some melatonin and was asleep by 9:30pm.

**Race day morning:** We set our alarms for 4:30am, but I was fully awake by 4am‚Ä¶ I was excited. I lay there in bed trying to sleep a bit more, but the adrenaline was too much. Once the alarm went off, I made some coffee and sipped on some electrolytes. Breakfast was a bagel with jam, a bowl of oatmeal with honey, a banana, and a Rice Krispy treat. I double-checked the IM app and saw that the official water temperature was 76.1 F, the absolute max limit for a wetsuit legal swim‚Ä¶ amazing!

We gathered up our stuff and walked over to transition at about 5:15am ‚Äì we were staying at the Holiday Inn Express, which was literally two blocks from transition. It was a moderate morning, high 60‚Äôs ‚Äì perfect. The transition area was a big empty parking lot, so the fact that it was paved and had lights overhead was wonderful‚Ä¶ no need for head lamps or trying to fumble around in the dark. We took our time getting our areas together and waited in line for the bathroom ‚Äì we were in no rush.

From there, they had shuttle busses to get you over to swim start ‚Äì but the line to get on a bus was sooooo long. We seriously considered skipping the line and just walking to the swim start, but we were told that would be very difficult ‚Äì it‚Äôs not a direct route, so it would‚Äôve been a 2-mile walk. So, we waited for a bus, which actually wasn‚Äôt as long as the line made it seem and arrived at swim start.

**SWIM:** I am telling you, this is the best possible swim start you could imagine‚Ä¶ It takes place at SRP Park, which is home to the Augusta Green Jackets baseball team. The surrounding area is very developed, so there‚Äôs sidewalks, lamp posts, real bathrooms ‚Äì it was a super clean and comfortable to put on wetsuits. No muddy, sandy, or grassy lots. Once you‚Äôre ready, they line you up throughout the concourse of the baseball stadium. Self-seeding as usual.

At best, I‚Äôm only an average swimmer, so I placed myself accordingly ‚Äì in the 35-37min bracket. It had rained a lot leading up to race-day, so everyone was expecting a fast/downriver swim, but I was still a bit skeptical. Plus, I just kinda completely disregarded any swim training. I legitimately only trained in the water twice prior to this race‚Ä¶

I have always been very comfortable in open water. I grew up waterskiing and competed in college, so open water has never been a concern of mine. I also understand that 90% of speed in the water is down to technique, and because I don‚Äôt have the resources to get myself a coach, I figured I‚Äôm just gonna wing it.

So, they start filling athletes down and out the back of the stadium, where you go down a set of stairs and onto a dock, where they are releasing 3 people every 5 seconds. The swim starts on the South Carolina side of the Savannah River, so you first swim out to the middle of the river, before taking a slight left to start the journey down river. If you are not the strongest swimmer, I recommend starting the swim from the right-most dock. This makes it so that your angle into the middle of the river is the most gradual, and you are not fighting the current as hard to make the first turn buoy ‚Äì I took this approach, and I really liked it.

My swim strategy was simple: Take it easy. I know this is not my strength, I know I‚Äôm not Michael Phelps‚Ä¶ so why try to be him? I was just going to get in the water and take it one stroke, one kick, one breath at a time. The difference between me pushing really hard and just coasting in the swim is 5-7 minutes max‚Ä¶ not worth it. So sure enough, I hop in the water and just relax‚Ä¶ It works beautifully. Omg I am just gliding. It feels effortless‚Ä¶ and people were right; the current is MOVING! My watch is buzzing and ticking off 100yd increments so quickly, it‚Äôs insane. I am elated in the water but still trying to tell myself to stay calm.

Current aside, swim conditions were not that ideal. I‚Äôm not sure if it was because there was lots of rain in the days before the race, but I kept getting river weeds all in my hands and face. I tried not letting them distract me - most of the time they just fell right off, but I did have to pull some off my goggles at one point.

The other thing that was difficult was the sun‚Ä¶ The sun was rising directly in-line with the river. So sighting was not the easiest. I basically just tried to make out the triangular shape of the buoys against the outline of the sun and used those as my guide.

But as the echoes of Dory kept ringing in my head (Just keep swimming!) I finally spotted the swim exit and started hanging to the right to make my escape. By this point, my goggles had fogged up enough to where I couldn‚Äôt quite make out what my watch was telling me for time, but I knew I had crushed my expectations. Soon I found the exit ramp and got out of the water. One of the volunteers was yelling ‚ÄúWelcome to Georgia!!‚Äù which I thought was funny. I clicked my watch to mark the end of my swim and started the uphill jog to T1.

[Glancing at my watch, shocked at the swim time!](https://preview.redd.it/zvni2ojh0xtf1.jpg?width=2134&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f2d090887590940a1f88b4b35db19b5bb4212a1c)

**Swim time: 27:40 (1:25/100m)** ‚Äì wayyyyy faster than I was expecting. A full 5 minutes faster than my PR. That river was HUSTLING. 73^(rd) of 209 in age group, M25-29

**T1:** The jog to T1 is about a ¬º mile, steady incline up the levee of the river, there were wetsuit strippers there to help out, and the race organizers had lined most of the run with carpets which was super nice. Once you got up the hill, it became a brick path, and there was a small decline on the bricks to get into transition. The bricks were obviously wet, and although I didn‚Äôt see anyone slip and fall, it would not have surprised me if someone did.

Once I got to my bike, I took some deep breaths to try and settle the heart rate. It never works lolol. Because the swim was so fast, I felt no need to rush. I put on my gear quickly, but very calmly, and ate a Torq bar to get some carbs in. Grabbed my bike and left transition.

**T1 time: 8:02** ‚Äì one of my slower times, but again, I made no effort to rush, and the jog to transition was not short, plus the transition lot itself is quite large. Oh well. Something to work on‚Ä¶

**BIKE:** Alright baby, it‚Äôs time to cook. This is my time. I often tell people that I am a cyclist first‚Ä¶ and sometimes I do triathlon on the side. I frequently ride 150+ miles a week and do a good bit of crit racing as well as gran fondos. So, if I wanted to have a good day, this is where I was going to do it.

As I exited transition, there was a gaggle of people stopped right at the mount line, getting on one at a time. I didn‚Äôt really want to get stuck behind them, so I ran past them and the mount line for another 10 yards or so, jumped on the bike with a nice flying mount, and I was off. For the most part, my legs felt pretty good ‚Äì maybe a little heavy, but I knew once I got warmed up, they would be fine.

As is normal at the beginning of the bike course, it was so busy at the start. 3-4 wide sometimes. Plus, it was mostly just a single lane closure for the course, so it was quite narrow. Probably not the coolest/smartest move by me, but I had to move over beyond the cones to pass people who were just hanging out in the left side of the lane (reminder to please stay right if you aren‚Äôt passing, please!). But still, I was hammering away and passing as many people as I could!

My strategy for the bike was completely different than the swim‚Ä¶ ALL OUT. I kept both my power and heart rate pretty much right at threshold (170-185 bpm / 220-240w), and then whenever I came to a hill, I was gonna smash both the hill and the descent. We had a tailwind for the first portion of the bike, so IM said I averaged 27 mph in this section - woah. The middle section of the course is definitely rolling. Five or six punchy climbs, each climb was a 2-3 minute effort, and each had a decent roll-out where you could really build speed. I got up to 43mph, my dad 40mph. None of the hills were particularly steep, I think 6% grade was the max I saw, but it could‚Äôve been less. I think I only got out of my big ring once, and that was just because I was getting some cross-chaining, and I wanted to be more efficient.

[At the top of one of the hills. You can kinda get an understanding of the hills from this picture.](https://preview.redd.it/4gurwg5r3xtf1.jpg?width=2134&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=25d1b4524aa91ccbf259c62196171db1351a7bd5)

Regardless, I‚Äôm pretty small, I ride a road bike, and I climb quite well, so I just put my head down and hit the hills hard. I made up a lot of ground doing this. The last section of the bike, 10 miles or so, was standard riding, nothing particularly memorable‚Ä¶ I think we had a small headwind on the way back in, but it wasn‚Äôt bad. Of the three 70.3 bike courses I‚Äôve done, Augusta was definitely the most physically demanding with the rolling hills. While I would not say the course was technically difficult, it did require a few more skills: confident descending, climbing efficiently, cornering/handing with narrow lanes. But still a fairly straightforward course overall.

One thing I didn‚Äôt really understand was the lack of aggression by some other riders. Idk, maybe it‚Äôs just because I have a background in road/crit racing, but I feel like most of the riders were taking both the descents and the corners very timidly. My dad came to the same conclusion himself ‚Äì but he was also a state champion crit racer in his 20‚Äôs‚Ä¶ so maybe we‚Äôre biased. I know it can be a little freaky when the speed gets up there, but hey! It‚Äôs free speed! And a lot of time can be made up in corners with a good line ‚Äì not to mention saving energy out of the corners by carrying good speed through the corner‚Ä¶. Anyway, my dad and I both thought the road conditions were very solid. There were a few sections with a few bumps, but overall a very nice ride.

My nutrition plan was pretty simple: I wanted at least 130g of carbs every hour while on the bike. It sounds aggressive, but I struggle to get enough carbs while on the run, and my stomach usually handles calories on the bike very well. So I had a Carbs Fuel gel (50g) every 30 minutes, and I sipped on water with Torq carb mix (30g) throughout the hour. I brought two mixed bottles with me, so I was good for the first two hours. At the 2^(nd) aid station, I tossed one of my empty bottles aside and picked up plain water. For the last bit of the ride, where I had no more drink mix, I just took in an extra gel to compensate.

[Fiddling with the different data screens on my Wahoo](https://preview.redd.it/lapmyt614xtf1.jpg?width=2134&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=41927e8883213b193d8752688f2e1d1df38e9b16)

As I got closer to the end of the bike, I started checking my watch and head-unit to see how I was doing on time. Last year, I missed a 2:30 bike leg by 1 minute, so I really wanted to try and break that threshold this year. I was doing the math in my head, trying to figure out what speed I needed to maintain for the last 5-10 miles‚Ä¶ it was gonna be close! Regardless of my time though, I knew I had smashed it. I had to have passed 300+ people, and only got passed by one other dude. I rolled up to the dismount line, unclipped, and stopped my watch and head-unit. For context, my bike time last year was 2:30:58‚Ä¶

**Bike time: 2:30:59 (22.27 mph avg / 221w NP)** ‚Äì HAHAHAHA you‚Äôre kidding me‚Ä¶ one second difference. Missed a PR by that much‚Ä¶ Oh well, Augusta is a more difficult bike than Waco, so I‚Äôm still considering it a better performance, even if the clock doesn't agree. 17^(th) of 209 in age group M25-29.

**T2:** As I came into transition, I found myself singing the song that had been stuck in my head the entire bike leg‚Ä¶ Listen Up by Oasis ‚Äì my personal favorite of theirs and, in my opinion, Liam Gallagher‚Äôs best vocal showing. If you‚Äôve gotten this far, comment your favorite Oasis song.

By this time, the sun was fully up in the sky and it was getting warm! Low 80s, so still very manageable. But I made sure to chug some electrolytes in transition as well as another Rice Krispy treat. I knew I was still well-ahead of my goal time, so I made no effort to rush, and again just very calmly put on my run gear, and started the shuffle out of T2.

**T2 time: 4:25** ‚Äì Again, not my fastest at all, but I wasn‚Äôt trying to be overly quick. I can work on this.

**RUN:** In all my previous 70.3‚Äôs, I always completely fall apart on the run. It‚Äôs by far my weakest leg. I always love to blame it on my short stumpy legs. Like crazy short‚Ä¶ 25 inch inseam to be exact‚Ä¶ but I can‚Äôt rely on that excuse any longer. I can‚Äôt keep having a run time that‚Äôs barely faster than my bike time. So, I worked a little more this summer on really trying to improve my run. Not just in pace, but in technique and efficiency as well ‚Äì which seemed to be going well. Last year, I would average 9:30 miles in training‚Ä¶ this year I was consistently around 8:30 or faster ‚Äì but I knew I would be slower on race day. So, I decided that if I can do the run in 2hrs, I would be happy.

The 2025 Augusta run course was brand new this year. Previously, the course winded back and forth through downtown Augusta ‚Äì and while that was a very simple and flat course, I heard it was very exposed and quite hot. So, this year the organizers put us on an out-and-back route along the Augusta Greeneway on the South Carolina side of the river ‚Äì a very nice, paved recreational path with good amounts of shade and scenery. However, the trail has very slight, gradual incline as you head north. So, once we got on the trail a little after mile 2, it‚Äôs pretty much all uphill until the turnaround point, just after mile 6. Again, this incline is very slight. It‚Äôs honestly more mental than physical ‚Äì it‚Äôs only really going to affect you if you let it affect you.

But nevertheless, it feels good to hit that turnaround point and start heading down the hill. Aside from the Greeneway trail, there is one hill that you hit twice around mile 1.5 and mile 11. It‚Äôs not a huge climb, manageable, but annoying. I think the timing of the hills are the worst part ‚Äì mile 1.5 as you‚Äôre finally settling in and finding your rhythm, and then at mile 11 when you‚Äôre so close to being done‚Ä¶ just mentally screws with you. But physically, they aren‚Äôt terrible.

As for my performance, I started off quite well! Right out of transition, I could hear the announcer at the finish line already calling out names of people finishing‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs always a bit demoralizing hahaha ‚Äì like damn those people are fast! But I just tried to focus on my own race, and I was doing ok. I was hitting my goal pace, and managing it quite well! Averaging around 9min miles for the first 5 miles. However, I really started missing my headphones and playlists ‚Äì I need to do a better job of training without music. I was taking water and mortal and each aid station, and took my 50g gels every 30 minutes.

[Starting the run, right out of transition.](https://preview.redd.it/yrh6nga94xtf1.jpg?width=2142&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6f1c37fec7bf67fe7accf464f40efd05ac6aa573)

Around mile 8, I started getting pretty significant diaphragm side stitches. Classic. My HR was pretty elevated, and I was certainly working a little harder than I wanted to be ‚Äì so I wasn‚Äôt surprised. I backed off a little, but by mile 10, it was pretty bad and became difficult to get air in. So, I resorted to the tried-and-true strategy of jogging a half-mile, then walking for 30-60 seconds. This certainly made the stitch more manageable, but slowed my pace enough to where I wasn‚Äôt going to make a 2hr run leg. Oh well‚Ä¶ by this point, I had done the math in my head, and I knew that I was still going to safely make the overall goal of under 5:30 ‚Äì I could live with that. I told my dad later that it was a little disappointing because my legs actually felt quite good! Yes, they were fatigued, but my legs were not the limiting factor, it was my breathing and diaphragm that ultimately slowed me down. Things to work on.

My only real complaint about the run course is that the last aid station is around mile 11.5, or maybe a little bit after, I could‚Äôve used a little bit more water in that final 1.5 mile stretch‚Ä¶ but realistically, it‚Äôs definitely my own fault for not studying the course map more closely and preparing for that ahead of time.

As the run course wraps up, you cross a bridge back over into Georgia and head towards downtown Augusta on Renoylds street. Once on Renoylds, you can see the last corner into the finish chute about 8 blocks ahead of you! So close but ugh so far. There were a good amount of spectators and other finished-athletes along the sidewalk cheering and encouraging us along to the finish. Finally, that last corner arrived, and I made the turn into the finish chute. I high-fived a few people as I ran by and crossed the line. I was done.

[Finish! I didn't do a good enough job of getting distance from Pedro to get a clean finish photo, but oh well.](https://preview.redd.it/trnauugg4xtf1.jpg?width=2134&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fdd1e12ca80d1c65ee0d83013adfb2c9137c8cc3)

**Run time: 2:05:53 (9:35 min/mile):** a new run PR by 14 minutes. Still TONS of work to do here, but I will take it. 92^(nd) of 209 in age group M25-29

**Overall Time: 5:16:58** ‚Äì a new overall PR of 31 minutes! 40^(th) of 209 in age group M25-29

**Post Race/Conclusion:** Post race food was Papa John‚Äôs Pizza with bags of chips and sodas‚Ä¶ meh, I‚Äôve had better, but who really cares ‚Äì I‚Äôm never in a mood to eat after the finish. I grabbed two slices anyway, got my morning clothes bag and found a spot to sit down along the curb just before the finish line to wait for my dad to finish. I nibbled on the pizza and responded to texts from family, friends, and girlfriend who had been following along on the IM app. I tracked my dad and realized that he was on pace for a PR too! C‚Äômon dad!! He soon showed up and I cheered him on as he crossed the line himself. 6:19:52, a PR of 8 mins!

Overall, I‚Äôm very happy with my showing. I stuck to my plan on both the swim and the bike and it paid off. I still have a lot of room to grow in the run, but I still PR‚Äôed the run by 14 minutes, so I can‚Äôt be too frustrated. The only thing I would‚Äôve done differently was maybe seed myself a little higher in the swim to give myself less traffic on the bike, but I genuinely think that without that strong current, I seeded myself correctly. As for the course, I really enjoyed it. The swim lends itself a PR performance, and the run is standard. But the bike leg would slow you down if you struggle with rolling hills. I also don‚Äôt really know if the swim is always that fast, or if we just got lucky with the rainfall in the days prior. Regardless, it‚Äôs a very good race that is put on very well by the organizers, and logistically very easy ‚Äì I do recommend.

As for me and my 2026 goals‚Ä¶ I think it‚Äôs time to step up to the big kid distance. Yes, I could aim for a sub 5 time‚Ä¶ but my window to go for a full IM is so ideal right now‚Ä¶ if I‚Äôm gonna do one, now is the time‚Ä¶ IRONMAN California 2026, I‚Äôm looking at you.

I need a little advice. I work at this small cozy shop where we sell loose-leaf tea and coffee.
Our customers usually want to treat themselves or look for a gift, so the vibe is mostly very pleasant. Since our products are quite niche, we are more than happy to assist. We share our knowledge. Ask the customer to recommend the perfect product. Listen to other people's experiences etc. Basically, we are just a bunch of tea/coffee geeks enjoying our work, and being friendly and chatty comes with it naturally. 

Which is where the problem lies...

Some customers linger after the purchase. Sometimes the conversation stirs towards way too personal topics. Some (usually middle-aged men) come back over only to chat.

Do you have any tips on how to deal with such customers? How can I be more polite yet stern in dealing with them?

I also have one specific noncustomer customer I had to deal with last year... 
Over time this 70+ years old man started coming here for chat. I did not mind at first. But his visits kept becoming longer and longer. His record was 3 hours (it's very quiet in the summer). Worst of all, he did not pick up on any of my ""I'm busy, please leave"" cues. Even if a new customer came, he waited nearby and came back after. He only stopped after the last Christmas incident:

He came and lingered by the door for at least half an hour because there was a big queue and more people kept coming. He never joined the queue, clearly had no intention to buy anything. I could feel his eyes on me the whole time. 
The last straw was when I overheard two girls whisper about him uncomfortably. Now, I hate confrontation. I played this scene in my memory so many times, therefore I remember exactly what happened. 
I had to stop serving. At least six people were waiting. Since I work alone, everyone was watching, as I left my post. I came over to him and quietly said: ""*Name*, please don't do this to me. You can't stand here, the people are nervous because of you."" 
Now I don't think it was my demeanour that made him say ""I only wanted to wish you merry Christmas"" and leave. It was more likely the social pressure. He did not show up for almost a year. Until today. 

What should I do? How can I prevent this from happening again? I know the problem is with me,  because I get nervous easily. How can I appear more confident when confronting others? (But I still wanna be polite with it)

Do you have any tips for me?/ Did anything similar happen to you?",6,1759942550.0,CustomerService,10,1.0,False

Some were hilarious, but honestly‚Ä¶ a lot of them looked pretty good.

**What are these things?**  
Basically, Shiny Smile Veneers are snap-on covers for your teeth. You take an impression at home, send it in, and get a custom shine smile veneer back that hides stains, chips, or gaps. They‚Äôre removable, so no drilling, no expensive dentist visits, and no terrifying drills buzzing in your ears.

**The cost question**  
Everyone in these threads asks the same thing: how much do shiny smile veneers cost? The shiny smile veneers price is usually around $200‚Äì$400 for a full set, which is a fraction of what permanent veneers cost. A few people even bragged about finding a shiny smile veneers coupon code and paying less.

**Before and after results**  
The shiny smile veneers before and after photos are the wild part. Some users go from coffee-stained teeth to a Hollywood smile overnight. Of course, not every fit looks perfect, and a couple of reviews say the first impression kit didn‚Äôt work out, but most mentioned free remakes until it fits right.

If you‚Äôre curious about how the process works, here‚Äôs a breakdown: [**Shiny Smile Veneers ‚Äì Official Offer Page**](https://getshinysmileveneers.com/offer-01-j/?lpid=1089&source_id=DL&utm_source=8928&utm_medium=&utm_term=1089&aff_id=8928&sub_id=&req_id=&oid=1089&device_type=&country_name=&oid=1089&affid=8928&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/ShinySmileVeneers%7CRICKBRIQUA)

**The verdict?**  
After scrolling way too long through shiny smile veneers review posts, I‚Äôm convinced they‚Äôre not magic, but they‚Äôre also not a scam. Think of shiny smile teeth veneers as the ‚Äúbudget cosplay‚Äù of dental work - not perfect, but surprisingly good if you don‚Äôt expect them to feel exactly like natural teeth.",1,1759942547.0,ShinySmileVeneers,0,1.0,False

It's been like a month since I intake caffeine and I decided that I have to stop and think for a while of how to pervent myself from having another anxiety from caffeine consumption.

I have hypertension before and it's no fun but I got through it but right it I'm serious about my health and what to do to keep myself away from caffeine and stick to better alternatives like supplements (Coq10) and teas.

1o1fx48,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1o1fx48/the_chair_on_my_campus/,The chair on my campus,"The aroma of aged varnish and dust hung in the dormitory's fourth-floor common room like a ghost that could not be banished. It was a room referred to by the students as ""the lounge,"" a room where coffee cups clattered, laptops whirred, and backpacks rested like discarded armor. In the corner, beneath the unforgiving fluorescence, was a single wooden chair‚Äîunadorned, ordinary, its black‚Äëpainted legs moderately scuffed, the cushion faded teal that had long since lost its native color. No one paid it a second notice; it was merely a piece of furniture, a spot to rest weary limbs after a long night of reading.

But the chair had a reputation that no one could quite put into words, a whispered rumor that passed from freshman to freshman like a secret handshake. It was said that anyone who sat on it too long would see things that weren't there, hear voices that weren't their own, and‚Äîmost frighteningly‚Äînever again exit the room.

The tale started, as all such tales begin, with a skeptic. Sophomore psychology major Maya Patel had a habit of writing off campus legend as mass nervousness. She liked the rush of disproving myths, and the chair, with its shady past, was the ideal target. ""It's just a chair,"" she said to herself, extracting a notebook from her backpack and plopping down on the chair with a sigh of victory. She rested her elbow on the armrest, leaned forward to rest her chin in her hand, and opened up her laptop to write a paper on cognitive dissonance.

The initial minutes were normal. The chair creaked slightly as she adjusted, the fluorescent lights flashed in their relentless, buzzing beat, and a far-off siren howled from someplace in the city. But then the room tipped, minutely, as if the floor had been shifted beneath her. Maya blinked, and her eyes focused. For an instant the walls of the lounge melted away into a corridor of infinite doors‚Äîeach a black mouth, opening and inviting. A chill draft swept the back of her neck, and she caught a sound, a high, cracked giggle of a child, as if someone cowered behind the curtain. She swiveled her head, but the room remained, chairs and tables unaltered, the only noise the deep hum of the building's air circulation.

Maya's heart pounded. She attempted to rise, but the cushion constricted, as if the very fabric of the chair was enfolding around her legs. She strained, the wood of the backrest digging into her vertebrae, and a burst of sharp pain shot through the base of her back‚Äîlike a shard of ice thrust deep into the bone. She cried out, grasping the seat, and that's when the real horror of the chair was discovered.

The wood softened and decayed, bit by slow bit, in Maya's imagination, revealing a dark hole that glowed with a dim, red light. Out of that space emerged a breath‚Äîsoft, honeyed, full of the promise of peace from her stress, from the weight of finals, from the constant din of the world. ""Sit,"" it whispered, ""and relax. Let me bear the load.""

Maya‚Äôs rational mind screamed to run, but the chair‚Äôs grip tightened, and a wave of unnatural calm washed over her. The illusion of the hallway faded, replaced by a memory she didn‚Äôt own‚Äîa childhood bedroom, a cracked mirror, a scar on her left wrist she never remembered getting. The voice cooed, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all the same, Maya. You‚Äôre not alone.‚Äù Her thoughts became a maelstrom of borrowed memories, each one more tragic than the last. In a sudden, animalistic surge of terror, she slammed her laptop shut and leapt up, the chair screeching as if it were alive.

She stumbled toward the exit, heart pounding so hard it seemed to echo in the empty hallway outside. The door opened to a corridor lined with rows of exactly the same chairs, every one exactly like the one she'd left behind. She looked back. The teal chair was gone, and in its place was nothing but a space where a dark stain remained on the floor‚Äîa stain that would never dry. The hall's fluorescent lights blinked, and a wind that seemed to come from nowhere urged her forward. Maya ran into the stairwell, shutting the door behind her, and the building let out a sigh, the lights flashing back to stable white.

When she was discovered at 2‚ÄØa.m. by the dormitory's night guard, Mr. Dobbins, shaking and crossing her arms, she could hardly talk. ""It was‚Ä¶ it was a‚Ä¶ a chair,"" she stammered, her eyes wide with a fear that would not rest. ""It showed me‚Ä¶ things."". I believe it wanted me to‚Ä¶ stay. He walked her to the infirmary, where she was checked for injuries that couldn't be located. The back of her neck had a light bruise, the outline of a curved nail, but the doctor couldn't account for it.

Maya never went back to the lounge. She moved to a different campus a month afterward, but the recollection of the chair lingered, causing her to remember whenever she sat on a bench, a stool, or a bus seat. She started keeping a journal, recording every dream, every glimpse of ghostly light, every time a child's laugh rustled from the edges of her mind.

She was not the first to document a tale. A decade ago, a graduating senior named Alex McKinnon had written in his engineering thesis that the chair ""had a resonant frequency similar to the human brain's theta waves, potentially causing hallucinations."" He had inexplicably perished in a campus fire that engulfed half the west wing, and his thesis went unpublished. His own scribblings, discovered on his belongings, detailed an experiment in which he'd placed a pressure sensor on the seat. The readings exhibited spikes that bore no correlation to any physical pressure, as if the chair was sensing something non-tangible‚Äîfear, perhaps, or a psychic residue.

There had been a freshman, in the year leading up to Maya's experience, named Jenna Ruiz, who vanished after a study session all-nighter in the lounge. Her roommate had heard stifled screams and a sharp metallic clang, but when the resident adviser opened the door, all was well: desks neatly arranged, a half-finished essay on the desk, and the chair still upright, unmoved. Jenna's phone was discovered in the trash, screen broken and a single message scrolled open: ""Don't sit."" The message arrived mere minutes before the power went out and the building was left in darkness. The security camera caught only a hint of movement on the chair's backrest as if something had passed by unseen.

No one knew where the chair came from. It wasn't ever inventoried in the dorm. When university archivist Ms. Caldwell rooted through maintenance logs spanning decades, she uncovered the first reference to a ""black chair"" in a 1973 renovation report describing it as a ""donated item from the alumni association, labeled as 'for student use.'"" The name of the donor was smudged, the signature unreadable, and the accompanying photo was grainy‚Äîone of a blurry silhouette of the chair, its legs darker against a lighter background. The university's first dean had retired during that year, and there were rumors that he had been preoccupied with ""psychic research,"" a pastime which was never admitted.

One rain-gleaming night, following the experience with Maya, a class of students‚Äîinterested, rebellious, and partly encouraged by the weekend celebration‚Äîdecided to explore. They ventured into the lounge equipped with a portable recorder, a flashlight, and one disposable camera, seeking to document any ""paranormal activity."" The chair sat in wait, its teal cushion smudged by the specter of rain that filtered through the broken windows.

They sat. One by one, each of them in turn, laughing nervously, challenging the others to remain longer. The recorder picked up low humming that built into white noise, and the camera flash lit up the room, but something was amiss‚Äîthe flash caught a dim shadow behind each sitter: a presence covered in a torn white sheet, its face empty, its hand out toward the chair. When the flash dissipated, the figure vanished, leaving a ripple in the fabric of existence, as if a stone had been cast into the water.

As the final student, a sophomore named Ethan, stepped up onto the chair, the room grew cold. The lights behaved erratically, going out for the span of a heartbeat before flaring back on at a brightness that forced the students to shield their eyes. The back of the chair creaked, a sound akin to bone breaking. From inside the wood, a raspy voice spoke in an ancient tongue, ""We have been waiting."" The legs of the chair appeared to stretch, reaching deep into the shadows until they vanished into the floorboards. Ethan's scream was choked off, a sound pulled into the darkness as the cushion of the chair collapsed like a lung expelling its final breath.

The recording was then subjected to analysis. The hums were of a frequency which certain neurologists contend can ""break down the blood‚Äëbrain barrier,"" permitting external stimuli to penetrate perception. The thin silhouettes recorded on the disposable film, when processed, were seen as faint impressions‚Äîsuch as a fingerprint left on the camera sensor, a ghostly trace of whatever had been resting there.

When the university board finally directed the removal of the chair, a maintenance team came with a crowbar and a pair of gloves. They moved in, but the surface of the chair became warm, like a glowing ember. When they attempted to pick it up, the backrest recoiled, shattering the crowbar into two pieces. One of the men cursed, retreating, his eyes wide with fear. The temperature in the room plummeted, breath misting. Out of the darkness on the other side of the doorway came a low, sweet lullaby‚Äîa song that sounded like one everyone's ears in the building knew, but no one could remember to have heard. The employees ran for it, the door clanging behind them as though it had a mind of its own.

The chair was never seen or heard of again. It disappeared as quickly as it came, leaving but a faint burn mark on the floor and the lingering scent of old iron and pine. The dorm was shut down for a semester, then reopened after a good cleaning. The lounge was painted, the chairs replaced, the windows reinforced. But the evening whispers continued, the same childlike laugh ringing out through the ductwork, and every now and then a student would catch a glimpse of a brief flash of teal in the reflection of the hallway‚Äîa sign that some things do not belong.

1o1ftqi,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o1ftqi,I vibecoded a physical product business instead of another SaaS (and it's actually working),"**TLDR: Don't build another SaaS or web tool, build a business.**

recently I saw an ad for a cafe journal a while back: a book where each page was a different coffee shop in a specific city, and it had an area for ratings, notes, etc to be filled out with a pen.  
  
I then had the most developer thought possible: ""i could pull that data from an API"" 

with automation, I could generate a book for every single city.

so i did. built a quick prototype, researched print-on-demand, and realized this was totally doable.

RestaurantPassport was born

**the setup:**

bunch of AI generated CLI scripts that talk to APIs. nothing fancy. 

`pnpm curate-restaurants --latitude <x> --longitude <y> --radius 5000`

`pnpm generate-book --name ""Will"" --city ""Denver""`

set up an account on a print on demand provider for printing, listed on [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/shop/RestaurantPassport) and Shopify, and I was done.

when someone puts in an order, I run the script to get local restaurants, then generate a pdf.

the print on demand company ships the book directly to the customer. I never touch the product.

**the weird part (that i actually love):**

i don't have to make everything perfect before shipping. my entire background is software engineering and so I am used to everything needing to be production-ready and polished. but with this? i have a working process and i'm slowly automating pieces over time.

i curate the data via a script, but i still manually validate restaurants to make sure they're not permanently closed or chain restauraunts. eventually i'll automate more of it, but right now at the scale we're operating at it doesn't matter.

feels way more like how actual businesses work vs the SaaS model where you need to build everything upfront.

**the numbers:**

sold first copy about a month ago. four more since then. $100 total revenue. we've done literally zero marketing - just listings on Etsy and our Shopify site.

after that first sale with a good review, more people started finding the shop organically.

**why i'm posting this:**

if you're a dev thinking about building something, **you don't have to build another SaaS**. the market is absolutely flooded.

but there are so many other types of businesses with automation opportunities. physical products, local services, content businesses, whatever.

my advice: find a business model that interests you, start doing things manually. document your process. then identify the sub-processes you can automate over time.

don't copy the SaaS mindset where you have to build and automate everything from day one. just think about actual businesses you could operate and automate small parts of it.

code is everywhere, not just in SaaS.

anyway, that's where i'm at. happy to answer questions about the process or the tech side of things.",4,1759942001.0,SideProject,0,1.0,False

1o1fshm,https://www.reddit.com/r/SmallYoutuber/comments/1o1fshm/for_small_youtubers_why_you_need_a_professional/,For Small YouTubers: Why You Need a Professional Landing Page (And How to Get One),"Hey everyone,

I've been talking to a lot of smaller creators lately, and I keep hearing the same frustrations:

* **""Brands don't know how to reach me""** \- Your contact info is buried in a YouTube description that nobody reads
* **""I lost a sponsorship opportunity""** \- Because you didn't have a professional way to show your stats and portfolio
* **""Supporters ask how to support me""** \- But you don't have an easy way to accept donations beyond YouTube memberships

Here's the thing: **Big creators have media kits, professional websites, and agents. You need that too.**

# The Problem With Just Having YouTube

Your YouTube channel is great for content, but terrible for:

* Showcasing your full portfolio in one place
* Making it easy for brands to contact you professionally
* Accepting direct support from fans
* Displaying all your social media analytics
* Showing brands your engagement rates and demographics

# What Actually Works

After watching how mid-tier creators operate, here's what you need:

**1. A Professional Landing Page** Think Linktree, but actually professional. Somewhere that shows:

* Your channel stats across all platforms
* A portfolio of your best work
* Easy contact options
* Professional bio and rates
* Ways for supporters to donate

**2. A Place Brands Can Find You** Brands actively search for creators in specific niches. If you're not in their search results, you're invisible - no matter how good your content is.

**3. Simple Monetization Options** Not everyone can join your membership. Sometimes fans just want to buy you a coffee or donate once. Make it stupid simple.

# I Built Something For This (Not Trying to Sell, Just Share)

I got tired of seeing talented small creators miss opportunities, so I've been working on a platform that combines:

* Professional creator profiles (like a media kit)
* A marketplace where brands post opportunities
* Direct donation options for supporters
* Analytics dashboard to track everything

Here's an example of what a creator profile looks like: [https://atiscon.com/@abusayedopu1](https://atiscon.com/@abusayedopu1)

You can create one at: [https://atiscon.com](https://atiscon.com)

**For early adopters:** You'll get premium features for free, permanently. I'm just trying to get feedback and help creators right now.

# What You Get

‚úÖ **Public Profile** \- Professional landing page with all your links, stats, and portfolio  
‚úÖ **Brand Opportunities** \- Get discovered by brands looking for creators in your niche  
‚úÖ **Direct Donations** \- Easy way for supporters to contribute (like Ko-fi but integrated)  
‚úÖ **Analytics** \- Track clicks, views, and engagement  
‚úÖ **Gallery** \- Showcase your best work with photos/videos  
‚úÖ **Messaging** \- Direct line to brands and supporters

# Why I'm Sharing This

Honestly? I'm building this because I've seen too many good creators give up because they couldn't monetize or get noticed. The barrier between ""hobby YouTuber"" and ""professional creator"" shouldn't be having an expensive website or agent.

If you're:

* Under 100K subscribers
* Struggling to land brand deals
* Getting DMs asking ""how can I support you?""
* Wanting to be taken more seriously as a creator

This might help. Or don't use it - I'm just tired of watching talent go unnoticed because they don't have the ""professional setup.""

**TL;DR:** Small creators lose opportunities because brands can't find them or contact them professionally. Having a proper landing page + profile in a creator marketplace makes a huge difference. Built a free tool for this if anyone wants to try it.

Happy to answer questions or hear what's actually stopping you from landing sponsorships. Let's help each other out.

*Note: Yes, I built this platform, but I'm genuinely trying to solve a real problem I see constantly. Early users get premium free forever because I just want feedback and to help creators succeed.*",1,1759941927.0,SmallYoutuber,0,1.0,False

Looking for recommendations that understand fasting,"Been doing 18:6 IF for about 5 months and finally realizing proper hydration during fasting windows makes a HUGE difference in how I feel.

**Current challenge:** Most tracking apps don't really account for fasting protocols. They just remind you to drink at random times, which isn't helpful when you're trying to time hydration around eating windows.

**What I'm looking for:** Customizable reminders that respect fasting hours Can track different types of beverages (water, tea, coffee, electrolytes) Shows daily progress without being annoying Ideally works with Apple Watch for easy logging

**What I've tried:** MyFitnessPal: Water tracking feels like an afterthought Hydro Coach: Too many notifications, doesn't sync well WaterMinder: Actually pretty good, clean interface and good Apple Watch app Water Llama: Cute but too gamified for serious use

Currently leaning toward WaterMinder because it's straightforward and I can customize reminder times to fit my fasting schedule. Plus it doesn't try to upsell premium features for basic hydration tracking.

**Questions for the community:** Do you actively track hydration during IF? Any apps specifically designed for fasting lifestyles? How much water during fasting vs eating windows?

My energy levels are so much better when I'm consistent with hydration, but I need a system that actually fits the IF lifestyle.

Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

So, midterm season is hitting me like a 7-foot tall squirrel from Queen's Park. I was in Robarts, 13th floor, just absolutely getting destroyed by a MAT137 problem set. I'm staring at this proof, my brain is leaking out of my ears, and I‚Äôm pretty sure the letters on the page started swimming in front of my eyes.

I got so stressed that I slammed my fist on the table, and I swear to you, the air around my hand shimmered with golden light and a tiny wisp of smoke came out of my nose. Like, actual smoke. It smelled like sandalwood and ozone. The person across from me just stared, and I mumbled something about a weird vape pen and ran to the bathroom.

I splashed water on my face, and when I looked in the mirror, there was this faint, glowing scale pattern on my forehead. It faded after a few seconds.

Naturally, I did what any of us would do: I ignored it and went back to the P-set, because my academic validation is more important than a minor hallucination.

But it happened again when I was trying to buy coffee at Sid Smith and my T-Card didn't work. I got flustered, the debit machine flickered, and all the lights in the building dimmed for a second.

Long story short, I called my dad to complain about my life. He was weirdly quiet and then just sighed and said, ""The celestial seal is weakening. You're drawing on the family power.""

I was like, ""What family power? The power of pattern baldness?""

And he goes, ""No, son. Our family. You are the heir to the Dragon Throne of the Eastern Sea. I am Ao Kuang, the Dragon King. Your real name is Ao Bing.""

So... yeah. Turns out my dad isn't a 'logistics manager' in Shanghai. He's a literal dragon king who controls the tides and rains. All those childhood stories he told me weren't stories. He expects me to come home after this semester to start learning how to manage rainfall patterns and appease the celestial bureaucracy. He says my 'university degree' is a cute mortal hobby.

I'm sitting here in my dorm at New College with two midterms and an essay due next week. My dad is texting me (on a magic jade tablet, no less) asking if I've mastered my hydrokinesis yet. I haven't even mastered how to get a decent grade in ECO101.

So, my question for you all is:

Does the registrar have a form for this? Is ""destined to rule the eternal tides and command the legions of the sea"" a valid reason to request a deferral? Should I add ""Crown Prince of the Dragon Palace"" to my LinkedIn and see if it helps with PEY applications?

TL;DR: Was cramming for calculus, accidentally discovered my dad is the Dragon King, and now I have a divine succession crisis on top of my academic one. What do I do?

2. preset-vaapi as well as preset-intel-qsv-h264. Video streams are h264. Preset-intel-qsv-h264 and iHD would crash every 2 days.
3. Ensured that /dev/dri/renderD128 is set correctly.
4. Ensured that the LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME is set appropriately (now on i965).
5. Turned off hardware acceleration with hwaccel_args: """"

The only thing that worked was when hardware acceleration was off. The system would work reliably for months, requiring reboots only during kernel upgrades. 

No errors on the frigate logs.
The couple times I tried to look at journalctl (""sudo journalctl  -b -1 -e"") I don't seem to see any errors either around the time the system crashes.

Frigate General Stats page shows 29% CPU, 5% intel GPU on preset-vaapi. vaainfo button shows

My alarm doesn‚Äôt go off, and I accidentally miss my personal training session. My saving grace is that I don‚Äôt need to go into work until a bit later because of a doctor‚Äôs appointment. I drove to the appointment and pay the co-pay ($30.00). Weirdly, I run into my dad there, who lives an hour away. We make plans to get lunch today while he‚Äôs in town. Somewhere in there, I have a protein shake that‚Äôs my usual breakfast.

After the appointment, it‚Äôs a 20-minute drive to work. I‚Äôve been training a coworker, and she‚Äôs a slow learner who doesn‚Äôt communicate well when she doesn‚Äôt understand something. I juggle this on top of my other projects, and also remember that I need to renew a professional certification ($50, expensed). Lunch with my dad is a welcome break ‚Äì we get Indian food and I pay ($37.74). A few meetings in the afternoon, and then I head out. I stop by the gas station to refill ($22.16) on the drive home and grab a spare key from a coworker R. who asked me to check on his place on Sunday while he‚Äôs out of town.

At home, I activate my sourdough starter. I‚Äôm driving out to visit my college friend C. tomorrow night and promised to make her some sourdough bagels. I cook myself dinner (ramen with bok choy and tofu), and then call someone from my church who asked me to design a flyer for a memorial service on Saturday. Finish making the bagel dough, and then read a bit. H. texts me that my scheduled rent payment hasn‚Äôt come through on Venmo. This has happened twice in the past several months. I send it to her with an apology, research the problem a bit (I think the issue is my bank?), and then go to bed.

Total: $89.90

*Thursday*

I wake up early to boil and bake the bagels before work. They come out a bit misshapen but taste great. (I always eat the first one right out of the oven.) I save one for H., then drive to work.

When I get to the office, I see Venmo auto-sent the rent payment that was scheduled for yesterday‚Ä¶ this morning. Luckily, H. has already sent it back. I continue training my coworker and go to a couple meetings, then order lunch from a Japanese place ($13.23). (I don‚Äôt usually order out, but I was travelling Monday and Tuesday for work, and am leaving tonight to visit my friend, so I didn‚Äôt prep lunches like usual.) I put in my PTO hours on my timesheet for tomorrow ‚Äì with all the overtime I did earlier this week, I only have to use 1.5 hours to get up to 40 for the week. Training my coworker runs long, and I leave the office later than I wanted to.

Pack quickly, grab the bagels, and then get on the road for a 5 ¬Ω hour drive. I stop at a gas station partway to fill up and grab an energy drink ($26.80). Arrive at C.‚Äôs house around 10pm and catch up for a couple hours before crashing on her couch.

Total: $40.03

*Friday*

Wake up and grab some yogurt, a bagel, and tea, and chat with C. and her roommate. They‚Äôre both working a half day from home, so I read a book on my phone until they clock out. We go for a walk by the river and do some birdwatching, then drive downtown to a market where we grab some fancy cheese and crackers for a house party tonight and I get some incredible Somali food ($22.80). We spend the rest of the afternoon chatting and canning a ton of apple butter. At some point I run out to buy vodka ($12.95). C.'s friends arrive for the party, where we play some games and do some drunk arm wrestling in preparation for a tournament we‚Äôre going to tomorrow. People eventually leave around midnight and I go to sleep immediately.

Total: $35.75

*Saturday*

Another tea + bagel + walk in the morning. We pick up another friend and drive to a tabletop cafe for lunch to play some board games. I have several cups of chai and a pizza bagel and pay the cover fee ($23.10). I calculate that I am at least 1% tea and bagel by body mass. For dinner we go to a nearby restaurant, where I get an Impossible burger and an orangey-tasting cocktail ($41.23). We drop by C.‚Äôs place and do a shot of vodka, then head out to a gay arm wrestling tournament at a bar. I venmo C.‚Äôs roommate for the cover and a drink ($20.00). We all lose our matches but it‚Äôs still a blast. Then we head to a barcade where C. covers my drink and I do very badly at pinball. C.‚Äôs roommate is sober and drives us home around midnight.

Total: $84.33

*Sunday*

Last day visiting! We walk to a coffee shop for breakfast, and I get a chai latte and a delicious apple muffin ($11.85). I want to get a trinket to hold the memory of this trip, so C. takes me to a Japanese import shop. I buy a small ceramic stegosaurus plate and some mini lucky cat figurines for myself, and get H. some glass bok choy earrings and a cute possum card for Christmas ($34.56). We play a quick board game back at C.‚Äôs house and then walk to a Palestinian cafe for lunch, where I get a veggie pita plate and pistachio baklava ($25.96). Then I pack, hug C. goodbye, and get on the road for the 5 ¬Ω hour drive back home. My friend P. calls me on the road and we chat for an hour before I realize I‚Äôm running low on gas. I stop to fill up and get another energy drink, then drive for another couple hours ($34.04). Back in town, I stop by R.‚Äôs place to water plants and grab mail, and finally get home around 10.

Total: $106.41

*Monday*

Back to the usual routine: personal training first thing, and then drive to work. I check my bank account and see it‚Äôs low because of the double Venmo pull and also my semiannual car insurance payment, so I transfer over $1,000 from savings. I catch up on work and order Indian food for lunch again ($13, but completely covered with reward points I‚Äôve been hoarding). Then I have a 4-hour virtual audit meeting that unfortunately runs over by an additional hour. I‚Äôm very tired and annoyed when I get back home. H. has taken over the kitchen with her boyfriend, and she offers me some of their dinner as consolation. I eat half a sleeve of Thin Mints to cheer myself up, then finish my book. I like it so much that I order a used copy on Thriftbooks, plus another book I‚Äôve been eyeing ($24.10). When I check my bank account again, I see a check I sent to my cousin for her wedding a couple weeks ago has gone through ($500.00) as well as an EZ pass payment for my trip ($35.00) ‚Äì good thing I‚Äôd topped up my account this morning. I play some *Hades II*, catch up on webcomics, and watch a couple shows on Dropout before heading to bed.

Total: $559.10

*Tuesday*

Wake up early to prep lunches for this week (pesto pasta with veggie sausage) and head to work. It‚Äôs another long virtual audit this morning, although fortunately it doesn‚Äôt run over. I post on a community Discord group about giving away a drawing tablet I don‚Äôt use (I got it as a gift from my dad a couple years ago and don‚Äôt feel right selling it). Someone I know from the group immediately messages, and I arrange to drop it off at his place later. A couple meetings in the afternoon and more time training my coworker. I‚Äôm running so behind on completing some reports, but just don‚Äôt have the patience to stay late today.¬†

Drive home, drop off the tablet, and then head back home to make some ramen and bok choy for dinner (forgot I was out of tofu). I read the news while eating, and I‚Äôm so angry at everything happening that I break down crying. In my vulnerable state, I read an email from my college science department and end up making a donation ($50).

I drive to pick up my friend Z. and we go to the introductory meeting of a book group my church is holding. There‚Äôs a surprisingly good turnout and we work through logistics. Drive Z. back home and talk about life. At home, I read the first several chapters of the book, and start reading another book on my phone for a bit before bed.

Total: $50.00

**Weekly Total: $965.52**

Food + Drink: $173.41

Fun / Entertainment: $43.10

Home + Health: $30.00

Clothes + Beauty: $0.00

Transport: $110.35

Other: $608.66

**Reflection:**

This was a chaotic and abnormal week for me, but it was such a blast to visit my friend! I usually eat out twice a month or so and rarely go out drinking. Putting this summary together, I definitely see patterns of emotional spending when I‚Äôm having fun or feeling overwhelmed. But overall I think I‚Äôm in a place where I can splurge like this occasionally.",20,1759941678.0,MoneyDiariesACTIVE,5,1.0,False
1o1foer,https://www.reddit.com/r/MasterPCreviews/comments/1o1foer/why_the_lenovo_ideapad_1_is_a_top_pick_for_best/,Why the Lenovo IdeaPad 1 is a Top Pick for Best Student Laptop,"From the moment I started using the Lenovo IdeaPad 1 15IJL7, I could tell it was designed with practicality in mind. It caught my attention first with its sophisticated gray finish, compact design, and lightweight build. At just 3.42 pounds, this laptop is extremely portable, which is perfect for my on-the-go life. Whether I was at a coffee shop or lounging in the backyard, carrying it around felt effortless. 

**Performance That Handles The Daily Grind**  
I‚Äôm not a hardcore gamer or someone who runs resource-intensive software, but I do rely heavily on multitasking for work and personal projects. Thanks to the 12GB of DDR4 RAM, jumping between dozens of browser tabs and applications was surprisingly smooth. Even with a video call, a spreadsheet, and Spotify running simultaneously, there was no noticeable lag. The Intel Celeron N4500 processor, though not high-end, managed to exceed my expectations for casual use‚Äîquick bootups and decent processing speed. 

[Check Lenovo IdeaPad 1 15IJL7 price on Amazon.](https://ultimateprinter.com/p/b0cf62h34n/)

**Crystal Clear Visuals With the Display**  
The 15.6-inch Full HD screen with 1920 x 1080 resolution stood out as a high point. Watching movies or editing photos became quite enjoyable, all thanks to the Anti-Glare coating and IPS technology, which ensured colors remained consistent even when viewed at an angle. That being said, the display isn‚Äôt super bright at 250 nits, so using it under direct sunlight wasn‚Äôt ideal. Indoors, though, it‚Äôs a reliable screen that enhances your everyday activities. 

**Storage That Doesn't Make You Sweat**  
The dual storage‚Äî512GB SSD coupled with 128GB eMMC‚Äîis impressive. Personally, I use the SSD for system operations and the eMMC for secondary storage, which keeps everything snappy and organized. Storing meaty files like videos and high-resolution images rarely caused space anxiety. It's an excellent balance between performance and expanded storage that caters to both work and leisure.

**Highlights**  
- The laptop is lightweight and easily portable.  
- Offers high-speed RAM for seamless multitasking.  
- Impressive Full HD display with Anti-Glare features.  

**Limitations**  
- The processor isn‚Äôt capable of handling demanding tasks like heavy 3D modeling.  
- It lacks an optical drive, which could be an inconvenience for those who still use physical media.  

**Bluetooth and Wi-Fi 6 Add Convenience**   
Staying connected has proven seamless with its Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth technology. With typical laptops, I‚Äôve occasionally experienced drops in connectivity when multiple devices were attached to the network. Thankfully, Wi-Fi 6 on this laptop felt stronger and noticeably consistent even during an intense workload. Combined with the inclusion of Bluetooth, pairing my wireless headphones was both fast and easy.

**Competitive Options**  
While exploring alternatives, I considered similar devices like the Acer Aspire 5 and HP Pavilion 15. Acer's model was comparably priced but had a less refined display and smaller RAM. Meanwhile, the HP Pavilion stood up strongly in terms of processor power but came at a higher cost and weighed heavier. Ultimately, the Lenovo emerged as an excellent middle-ground device‚Äîfitting for casual users who prefer a light machine with above-average power and storage. 

**Financial Value**  
Considering its feature set, the Lenovo IdeaPad 1 strikes a budget-friendly chord. It‚Äôs rare to find a combination of Full HD visuals, 12GB RAM, and solid dual storage in this price class. While it‚Äôs not for power users, what you do get is a balance that justifies its cost for students, casual users, or professionals performing general tasks.

This is different from my usual concert history in that it's about a place and time. And maybe an artist or two thrown in.

Monday, as I was waiting impatiently for Ricks Music Monday post I received a text from a friend with a utube link and no message. As I'm opening the link I get notification that Ricks post is up. I'm only half listening as I'm reading his post. I remove my ear buds so I can pay full attention to the post. I hadn't noticed what was playing, so I put the ear buds back on and hit play.

The video was John Sebastian at the Woodstock festival in 1969.
This was relevant to me for a few reasons. 
I was a big fan of his from before he and Zal Yanofsky formed the Lovin Spoonful. John is also 4 years older than I am, which means that when he was singing on the streets and coffee houses of the village I probably saw him numerous times. His was one of the first voices that I recognized. There were 2 that stood out from all the others, had a raw sound as the others were smooth. Being as I was 12-13 I wouldn't swear it was John Sebastian and Bob Dylan, but it was.

His performance at the festival has been a subject of debate since that day. 
He wasn't scheduled to perform and only went on  when the rain and lightning started and the producers needed an acoustic act. Others say he was scheduled for Saturday and went Friday as an observer. 
Either way it bought back memories. 

 Not of the festival,  which I didn't attend, not because the NY Thruway was closed, but because my 19 year old girlfriends father wouldn't let her go for 2 nights. 1 was fine though.

But the memory wasn't of the festival, it was of the town, which was over an hour away from the festival. It was about the time I lived there and my different run ins with him and other musicians.
Ellen, my ex, and I had a weekend house there from the early 70s to the early 80s and you ran into musicians everywhere, and they all interacted  with the people around. 
I had seen John in town before, exchanged hellos, but of all the groups that I had seen I never saw the Lovin' Spoonful. They only played the Fillmore West, never East.

So, the one time that we saw him sing was quite unexpected. 
We went to see one of our favorites, Laura Nyro, a singer/songwriter, and she calls John up to the stage. The stage is just 1/2"" off the floor. We were sitting right next to it, and someone taps me on the shoulder and asks if we can watch his son for a minute. I don't turn around and just say sure and the kid sits down. It's a 5 or 6 year old miniature John Sebastian. They sing Do You Believe in Magic and he walks by, says thanks, and goes back to his table.

There were always musicians around.  Some, like John Sebastian lived there and some would come to record at Dylans managers, Albert Grossman's studio or to get near the master himself. 

When I wrote all the musicians interacted, I lied.

Before his motorcycle accident Dylan would sometimes be seen in town, or at least through it on his way home, but afterwards he was never seen in town. 

The only other that was never seen was Garth Hudson of The Band, who was a hermit. I saw and spoke to each of the others, some more than others, and once with Robbie Robertson about which of 2 restaurants I was going to. I was there to pick up some Chinese after spending the day skiing in MA. I just wanted to get home, light a fire, and pour a drink.  I had seen him many times over the years and the way the conversation was going it seemed like he might ask me to join him, which would've been fantastic on any other night. I had been skiing every day for the past 25 days. I had 5 more before my vacation was over and I wasn't going to crash on the way home. 

Those kind of things, while a little out of the ordinary, were not totally out of the ordinary.
Once we walked into a craft shop in town and like all the stores in town the owners were friendly with everyone. He was showing something to Levon Helm and Rick Danko of The Band and after about 2 minutes Ellen said ""come on guys either you want it or not you're wasting my time here""

I think that I had a point to make with this, and I think it was a great place and time. There was something about Dylans manager, but not today.

Ladies and gentlemen, buckle up for a season opener that‚Äôs less ‚Äúbattle of the titans‚Äù and more ‚ÄúTitan vs. Overcooked Pasta.‚Äù The Boston Bruins, fresh off a season where they tied for the Eastern Conference‚Äôs worst points total (76, for those keeping score), face the Washington Capitals, who are basically a hockey version of a Netflix true-crime docuseries: *Alex Ovechkin: The 900-Goal Conspiracy*. Let‚Äôs break this down with the precision of a Zamboni operator on a caffeine IV.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Numbers Don‚Äôt Lie (But They Might Sneeze)

The odds paint a clear picture: **Washington is a heavy favorite** (-150 to -160 implied probability), while Boston is a +250 underdog (\~39% chance). The spread favors Washington -1.5 goals, and the total is set at 5.5 goals.

* **Washington‚Äôs Implied Probability**: At decimal odds of \~1.53, the Capitals are priced at \~65% to win. That‚Äôs like saying Ovechkin‚Äôs hair is 65% less likely to go rogue in 2025.
* **Boston‚Äôs Implied Probability**: At \~2.55, the Bruins are given a 39% shot. For context, that‚Äôs roughly the chance your Monday morning coffee will survive the commute unscathed.

The total of 5.5 goals is a middle-ground bet, with even odds on over/under. Given both teams‚Äô offensive firepower (Washington‚Äôs Dylan Strome had 82 points; Boston‚Äôs David Pastrnak is chasing 100+ for the fourth straight year), this game could be a popcorn contest.

---

### Team News: Injuries, New Coaches, and the Eternal Struggle of the Bruins

**Washington Capitals**: Alex Ovechkin is one goal away from 900 for his career. Let that sink in. The man is a hockey deity, and the Capitals are giving him a golden throne to sit on in Washington‚Äôs barn-burner of a home arena. Defenseman John Carlson and goalie Logan Thompson return, and the Caps‚Äô home record last season was 26-9-6‚Äîlike a Tesla on Autopilot, but for hockey.

**Boston Bruins**: The Bruins are playing without Patrice Bergeron and Brad Marchand‚Äîtwo pillars of their identity‚Äîfor the first time since 2003. It‚Äôs like ordering a Boston cream

I don't place blame on either, they were never compatible. Although I will say you would have to be a special type of woman to put up with his shit... But more timeline: In 1987 I gave up on dad, He was the type of guy who was emotionally abusive. He had remarried, but his wife died of a totally treatable cancer in '86, and he lost his mind. He had two kids with her, about 5 and 10 years old. He won the malpractice case, and each kid got over $100K for the loss of their mother. I was 23 at the time, and offered to move back with the three of them to help with the household. This did not go well. And resulted in me leaving, for good. So fast forward, my grandmother died in 1995, father's mother. She had virtually no estate, a car that I got and sold to pay for college, and a few thousand bucks, under $4K. 

So last week I mentioned I would be in the city my 1/2 siblings live in, and offered to meet for coffee. My sister meet with me, and I learned she thought grandmother hated her, her brother, father, and new step mother. Now, I know this was not true. Not even a little bit true. She didn't have a lot of respect for my father, but trust me, her lack of respect for her son was well deserved. She has an image of our father being a great man, a man of integrity, who was wronged by his mother and son (me). 

Like I said, she and I haven't been in touch for 15 years (I just found out she has a couple of pre-teens) but I am concerned she is going to go through life thinking that grandmother hated her. I know this came from my father, like I said, emotionally abusive and controlling, but would it be best to just let sleeping dogs alone? Or is honesty required here? I just don't know what to do. What would YOU want if you were my sister? I'm afraid I might crack how she feels about my father, who obviously manipulated her. And what would that gain her?? ",1,1759941510.0,family,3,1.0,False

I've been talking to a lot of smaller creators lately, and I keep hearing the same frustrations:

* **""Brands don't know how to reach me""** \- Your contact info is buried in a YouTube description that nobody reads
* **""I lost a sponsorship opportunity""** \- Because you didn't have a professional way to show your stats and portfolio
* **""Supporters ask how to support me""** \- But you don't have an easy way to accept donations beyond YouTube memberships

Here's the thing: **Big creators have media kits, professional websites, and agents. You need that too.**

# The Problem With Just Having YouTube

Your YouTube channel is great for content, but terrible for:

* Showcasing your full portfolio in one place
* Making it easy for brands to contact you professionally
* Accepting direct support from fans
* Displaying all your social media analytics
* Showing brands your engagement rates and demographics

# What Actually Works

After watching how mid-tier creators operate, here's what you need:

**1. A Professional Landing Page** Think Linktree, but actually professional. Somewhere that shows:

* Your channel stats across all platforms
* A portfolio of your best work
* Easy contact options
* Professional bio and rates
* Ways for supporters to donate

**2. A Place Brands Can Find You** Brands actively search for creators in specific niches. If you're not in their search results, you're invisible - no matter how good your content is.

**3. Simple Monetization Options** Not everyone can join your membership. Sometimes fans just want to buy you a coffee or donate once. Make it stupid simple.

# I Built Something For This (Not Trying to Sell, Just Share)

I got tired of seeing talented small creators miss opportunities, so I've been working on a platform that combines:

* Professional creator profiles (like a media kit)
* A marketplace where brands post opportunities
* Direct donation options for supporters
* Analytics dashboard to track everything

Here's an example of what a creator profile looks like: [https://atiscon.com/@abusayedopu1](https://atiscon.com/@abusayedopu1)

You can create one at: [https://atiscon.com](https://atiscon.com)

**For early adopters:** You'll get premium features for free, permanently. I'm just trying to get feedback and help creators right now.

# What You Get

‚úÖ **Public Profile** \- Professional landing page with all your links, stats, and portfolio  
‚úÖ **Brand Opportunities** \- Get discovered by brands looking for creators in your niche  
‚úÖ **Direct Donations** \- Easy way for supporters to contribute (like Ko-fi but integrated)  
‚úÖ **Analytics** \- Track clicks, views, and engagement  
‚úÖ **Gallery** \- Showcase your best work with photos/videos  
‚úÖ **Messaging** \- Direct line to brands and supporters

# Why I'm Sharing This

Honestly? I'm building this because I've seen too many good creators give up because they couldn't monetize or get noticed. The barrier between ""hobby YouTuber"" and ""professional creator"" shouldn't be having an expensive website or agent.

If you're:

* Under 100K subscribers
* Struggling to land brand deals
* Getting DMs asking ""how can I support you?""
* Wanting to be taken more seriously as a creator

This might help. Or don't use it - I'm just tired of watching talent go unnoticed because they don't have the ""professional setup.""

**TL;DR:** Small creators lose opportunities because brands can't find them or contact them professionally. Having a proper landing page + profile in a creator marketplace makes a huge difference. Built a free tool for this if anyone wants to try it.

Happy to answer questions or hear what's actually stopping you from landing sponsorships. Let's help each other out.

*Note: Yes, I built this platform, but I'm genuinely trying to solve a real problem I see constantly. Early users get premium free forever because I just want feedback and to help creators succeed.*",2,1759941470.0,SmallYTChannels,0,1.0,False

I've read many glowing comments about the Acacia Lunar; the budget committee will not approve its cost. I am certainly open to spend more than $30 but can go up to $150.

Seeking recommendations for a reliable scale that won't break my budget bank. I don't know how critical it is to have the 18.00g accuracy. If the scale has it, it would be a bonus, but I'm also good with 18.1g reading. 

The scale will be used mostly for weighing beans and measuring shot as they are pulled. I have a different, larger scale for pour overs. I would prefer a smallish size scale so I can put it on the Lelit Elizabeth and put the shot glass on it as the shots are extracted. So, being liquid resistant would be a nice feature to have.

My previous scale did not have the feature where a timer starts as soon as the first few drops hit the shot glass. Not sure if it is a 'want' or a 'need' feature. Kindly recommend your thoughts on that.

Today is the last day of Amazon deals. If there's something I can search for there on a discounted price, it would be good.

many thanks.

*Where Hockey Meets Absurdity*

The Toronto Maple Leafs and Montreal Canadiens are set to clash in the 2025-26 NHL opener, a game so steeped in rivalry it could make a historian faint. Let‚Äôs dissect this matchup with the precision of a Zamboni and the wit of a tired linesman.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Math-Infused Love Story

The Leafs are favored at **-166** (implied probability: \~62%), while the Canadiens sit at **+140** (\~41%). The over/under is **5.5 goals**, with the over priced at **-125** (DraftKings) and the under at **+100**.

**Why does this matter?**

* **Toronto‚Äôs offense** remains a beast: Auston Matthews (45 goals last season) and John Tavares (38 goals) form a duo so lethal, they could score on a puck frozen to the ice. The Leafs‚Äô additions‚ÄîMatias Maccelli and Dakota Joshua‚Äîadd depth, but let‚Äôs be honest: They‚Äôre just there to carry the coffee for Matthews‚Äô highlight reels.
* **Montreal‚Äôs defense** is a work in progress. Noah Dobson, acquired to shore up their blue line, is like a new firewall for a computer that still runs Windows 95. Their goalie, Sam Montembeault, has a career **.901 SV% vs. Toronto**, which is about the same accuracy as a toddler aiming a water gun.
* **Anthony Stolarz** (Leafs‚Äô starter) has a **2.14 GAA** and **.926 SV%** against Montreal, making him the NHL‚Äôs version of a ‚ÄúDo Not Disturb‚Äù sign for Canadiens attackers.

### News Digest: Injuries, Acquisitions, and Existential Crises

* **Toronto‚Äôs Mitch Marner** is now in Vegas, where he‚Äôll presumably learn to count cards instead of deking defensemen. The Leafs‚Äô new first line (Matthews, Maccelli, Knies) is like a luxury car: flashy, fast, and occasionally prone to oversteering.
* **Montreal‚Äôs Ivan Demidov** returns from injury, but his 12 goals last season were mostly against teams wearing the wrong jersey. The Canadiens‚Äô young core (Suzuki, Caufield) is like a startup‚Äîhigh energy, low consistency

They're all 650-700 CAD.

There are so many variables to each model that I find myself lost and cannot reliable make the right purchase without asking.

My wife mainly drinks lattes, I drink mainly americanos or regular coffee. Cappuccino or Flat Whites would be nice if the machine can make them.

I'm looking for ease of use, and ease of maintenance. My biggest concern is the milk frother and how to clean it.

Are the options up there good? is any one better than the other? what should I be looking for in a new purchase for a newbie.

  
Also, any chance there's a machine that would take 2 types of beans and brew them separately?

¬†It‚Äôs not fair that when I look up, I see the blue sky and faint whips of clouds. It‚Äôs not fair that despite the middle of summer the heat is made bearable by a cool, soothing air. The grass shifts around me in a pattern governed by the wind and the leaves softly hiss.

None of this should be here, not on this day.

¬†It should be ruin. Thunder and lighting should be shaking the heavens while gales rip apart the earth. I should be running for cover, praying that I am not cut down before my next step.

¬†Today should be a horrid day of floods and plagues‚Ä¶but instead it is beautiful.

¬†It is beautiful because something out there hates me.

¬†Without words, I watch as the casket is slowly lowered into the earth. I can feel the sorrow in my chest. It slowly pushes its way up though my neck and behind my face. It takes everything I have not to let it out. This of all times is when I should be able to cry, when I should let the sadness pour out of me.

¬†But I can‚Äôt.

¬†I don‚Äôt deserve it.

¬†The wind brushes against my hair, soothing the sweat on my brow. Around me, they cry. Children ask questions trying to grasp the truth in front of them. The casket reaches its end, the priest says the final rights. Some eyes turn to me. They want me to speak, but I have no words. I shake my head and keep it from leaking out of me. Some glance, other glare. I deserve it all, and more. I think of leaping down there for a moment. I stop myself.

Things move in a haze. My feet walk without my brain telling me to. Like cattle, I walk over to my sister‚Äôs car and get in. She says nothing to me. She understands me. All she can do is turn up the radio and hope that I say something. I‚Äôm not going to say anything. In fact, I may not speak again for the rest of my life. With everything my words have done it would be a blessing not to hear them.

¬†At the wake, I am unmoving. I stare out the window, the only one aware of evening slowly turning to dusk. They offer their condolences to me. Again, they want me to speak but I say nothing. There is nothing to say, not anymore. The wake is held in our‚Ä¶my home. It is a nice place, filled with memories. I will sell it before the month is over. I can‚Äôt afford it anymore, and even if I could I would still sell it. The only thing I feel is when my sister puts her hand on my arm. It stays there for a moment, a signal of her support. Then she goes.

¬†I stand in my home that is no longer a home. It is empty now. Even more so than it was before.

¬†My hands run across my face, dragging my eyelids down and forcing my lips into a deep grimace. I should eat something. I should move. I should do anything except stand here and watch as the day fades into night. When I turn, I see someone standing in my kitchen. It takes a moment for the fear to punch through my melancholy because I don‚Äôt know who she is. 

A stranger is in my home.

She is wearing a black ruffled ball gown that looks like it belongs in a museum in the Victorian age instead of a person in my house. She wears a veil over the bottom of her face, and a silver head piece over the top. It reaches down and covers her eyes, leaving the top part in the shape of a crescent moon. The part over her eyes is that of two devil faces. Their tongues hang out and reach down to her cheeks like silver tears. Her hair is grey and tied back into a bun. The few parts of her skin I can see, neck, hands, the edges of her jaw, are a pale grey. She stands with a polite posture, taking in the small collection of china I own. I watch her for one minute, then two, then three.

¬†‚ÄúExcuse me?‚Äù I say, startled at my own voice. It sounds hoarse, tired. Everything it should be.

Even though I can‚Äôt see her eyes, I feel like she blinks a few times. She turns to me, her smile nearly lost behind the veil. After a curt nod, she approaches. With nowhere left to go, I can only watch. Her dress does not even so much as ruffle as she moves. It is completely still.

¬†I wonder if I am dreaming.

¬†‚ÄúGood evening,‚Äù she curtises. Her voice is smooth and proper, the kind of voice that invokes the ideas of lords and castles. There is an accent behind it as well, the origins of which I can‚Äôt place. It is European but it is richer than that. I‚Äôve never heard anything like it before.

¬†My throat moves to speak, then ask her what she‚Äôs doing in my home. She cuts me off with a polite raise of her hand.

¬†‚ÄúI come to you with tidings of my lord. He sends his condolences for your loss, and an offer.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhatever you're selling, I‚Äôm not interested,‚Äù I want to sound angry, instead I sound tired.

¬†With a few stomps I arrive at the door and open it. The message is clear.

¬†‚ÄúThere is nothing to sell,‚Äù she continues, fiddling with the black gloves around her hands. She pulls at the very tips of her fingers one at a time. ‚ÄúOnly an offer, one that comes free of charge.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care. Get out.‚Äù 

She walks over to the side of the room where a potted plant sits on a stand. She brushes the back of her hands against the leaves, nodding in approval. When she turns around, she is looking into a picture, one that until this moment was sitting in my bedroom. She examines it. I see the veil shift as her expression does. The devils across her eyes meet me.

¬†‚ÄúDo you want him back?‚Äù 

That statement hits me in the chest. This stranger, this intruder, reached into me and crushed my heart with a single, lethal movement. It can‚Äôt keep it back anymore. I feel the tears come and everything tighten as I fall onto my knees. I sob, the only thing in my sight is the floor and my hands. A small hand puts itself on my back. It is comforting, but from it I feel a cold trickle across my body.

¬†‚ÄúIn two days, I will send someone to retrieve you. Go with them, ask as many questions as you like, and we will meet again. From there, you will have your chance. All that I ask in return is that you bring your grief and your appetite."" The hand retreated and I watched the darkness of her dress drift past me. I never looked down the hall, instead choosing to close the door behind me. Two days, she said. All I had to do was wait two days.

¬†I spent those days somewhere between a bottle and anger. Anger at myself, and at her. Who was she to come into my home and sell me her false promises? Then again, I want to believe her. Even if she is just a missionary for a cult preying on mourners, I want to go. There‚Äôs nothing left for me in this life. My phone buzzes every now and then. My sister, my parents, and friends. I put the phone in a drawer and shut it. For two days I feel like a stranger in my own home. Everything is new, foreign. Where I expect footsteps there are none. When I wake up I always think there will be coffee ready for me and there isn‚Äôt.

¬†This must be what hell is like. One step behind comfort, always reminded of what is gone. Always being reminded of what you did. I embrace it. I wallow on the floor, in the bathtub, and never do I lie in that once sacred bed. All it is a mattress with blankets, pillows and sheets. It takes everything I have to get through those two days. Then it comes.

¬†Outside, I see a limo pull up in front of my house. I walk out into the light, having to squint my eyes as they remember what the sun feels like. I nearly trip twice before I make it inside. I enjoy the cool darkness of it.

¬†I expect to see the woman again, but instead I see four others looking at me. They are also tired, haggard, burdened with the same weight I am. None of them speak to me as the limo moves through the city and then out of it. In the tinted windows, I see trees shift past us. We‚Äôre miles away now, miles from anyone but ourselves. A woman to the right is chewing on her nails. She‚Äôs younger than me by a decade. She wears a stained sweat shirt and her hair is nearly matted to her scalp.

She gives me the impression of a cat that was trapped in a wet bag.

To my right sits a young man, the youngest one here. He must be in high school. He keeps his head down and refuses to look at anything but his hands. The last two people are men as well, both around my age, maybe not. It‚Äôs hard to tell. My headache throbs in time to the wheels of the tire as they go through every bump on the dirt path. I can hear things scrap along the low undercarriage of the vehicle, causing it to jostle and shake even more than it already is.¬†

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôd she say to you?‚Äù The woman asks me with a finger in her mouth.

¬†I‚Äôm not going to speak. I have nothing to say. The boy to me left speaks instead, thinking that her question was for him.

¬†‚ÄúSame as you, probably,‚Äù he looks up from his hands for a moment. His eyes are beautiful.

¬†‚ÄúThink we‚Äôre gonna get trafficked? Organ harvested? Drug muled?‚Äù As she chuckles, I see the haggard state of her teeth and gums. Veins creep across the whites of her eye.

¬†The boy shrugs with a small smile, genuine in its curve. He holds out his hand reaching across me to do so.

¬†‚ÄúJames,‚Äù he says.

¬†‚ÄúMaggie,‚Äù She shakes it.

¬†¬†Finally, it comes to a blessed stop and I emerge out of it and into the light. It filters through the pine branches overhead. In front of me is a castle. It is ancient and looming, vines crawl up its timeworn stones while moss runs down its ramparts. The portcullis is rusted and stays open. I think of a mouth, open wide for us to walk in. The other people in the limousine have a similar reaction to me: confusion and wonder. I pace around only to see that the pine forest stretches on for as far as I can see. There is a low fog across the ground, and a stillness in the air. I take my ears and focus on them. They can only find the sounds of breathing in the shuffling of twigs as the others approach the castle. I wonder if I had been drugged at some point during the ride. The man who was seated by my left approaches the limo to ask the driver where he is. The limo drives off into the woods, vanishing out of sight in a few moments. The man swears and kicks the ground before recently turning to the castle.

¬†Maggie continues to chew on her nails with more vigor than before.

¬†I am the one that enters first. I pass through the gates and into the court yard. There are statues of cupids and nymphs covered in mold fawning over dry fountains. Path stones crumble under my feet as the dead plants between them reach out for me. At the end of the courtyard is a pair of wooden doors, equally as worn and tired as the rest of this place. It is easy to push them open.

¬†Air hits me. It is stale and acrid. I can feel the dust in it coating my lungs. While I cough the other comes in behind me. Wooden torches burn on the walls, casting everything in a warm glow. There is a table in front of me. There are other hallways reaching out from this center room, though they are barred with thick doors. In the edges of the light, I can see people standing. They were fine yet drab clothes, I think they are supposed to be servants. I do my best not to look at them or voids where their heads should be. Chairs scrap across the stone floor and creak under foreign weight as they take our places around the table. One of the men is trying his cellphone only to grow more frustrated at the static moving across his screen.

¬†‚ÄúDo you know what this is?‚Äù It takes me half a minute to register that I had been spoken to. I turn to Maggie.¬†

¬†‚ÄúI‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt know,‚Äù I say, avoiding her eyes. I feel a frustration welling up inside me that she would even attempt to talk to me. I do not know her. I do not want to know her. I‚Äôm only here for him. James keeps his eyes on the doors behind us, ready to run at any moment. We are in a castle that should not exist. There is nowhere to run. I take a seat and after sometime the others follow suit. The servants sway with the light of the torches, bending and twisting in tormented dance.

¬†‚ÄúLet‚Äôs hope this goes well,‚Äù James has a fake smile.

¬†I know a fake smile because I spent the last two years of my life looking at one.¬†¬†

¬†‚ÄúYou were all offered the same thing,‚Äù A voice came from the shadows, ‚ÄúA chance to take back what was lost.‚Äù My brain tells me that she appeared out of nothing, but I know better. She was there the entire time, still as death, watching us sit and mingle. It is her head dress that comes into view first before the rest of her body. The veil is gone, revealing a pair of lips covered in red lipstick. Cracks run across her face and when she speaks skin flecks off of her.¬†

¬†‚ÄúForgive my rudeness in our prior encounters, for there was not time to give you my name. I am Lady Ekle Vech [Beyersdorf](https://surnames.behindthename.com/name/beyersdorf), and I am glad to have such horned guests in my home,‚Äù she gave a deep bow, and as she rose the servants around her bowed as well, ‚ÄúForgive my lord, he will not be attending until after the banquet. Such is tradition.‚Äù 

*‚ÄúSuch is tradition,‚Äù* the servants moaned as one.

¬†‚ÄúWhat is this?‚Äù James was starting to sweat.

¬†I stay calm, focusing on opening and closing my hands.

¬†‚ÄúIt is an opportunity. One so rare that kings and emperors coveted it,‚Äù Ekle walked past him, making sure to trace her hand along his back. She stops at the head of the table directing her blind gaze to Maggie who still chews on her nail. I watch her jaw slow as she realizes that everyone is looking at her. Ekle smiles, showing black gums amidst white teeth.

¬†‚ÄúTell me, child, what is the most divine thing one can do?‚Äù

¬†Maggie‚Äôs mind turns for what feels like hours to the rest of us. She eventually surrenders with a shrug.

¬†‚ÄúSex?‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúA good guess. Anyone else?‚Äù Ekle turns to the rest of us, her smile betraying the smug satisfactions she is taking in our stupor.

¬†I think of anything else.

¬†Ekle answers our silence with a voice of reverence, ‚ÄúThe most divine thing one can do is consume. To take the essence of another, break it down and take it into your own form. It is the cycle of which we all participate in. It is what bridges the gap between the most holy of figures to the lowest of dregs. For we all must devour, and in turn be devoured. My lord understands this better than any of those who have lived. But he is generous, is he not? He has reached out his hand of communion down to you. All you need to do is grasp it.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAnd how do we do that?‚Äù James says ‚ÄúGive up our bank account numbers?‚Äù Ekle laughs. It is a gentle sound. It sends chills through my body.

¬†‚ÄúNo, not quiet. All you must do is consume,‚Äù Ekle‚Äôs face became serious, ‚ÄúConsume His flesh, and in turn its powers shall be yours.‚Äù The servants came from the shadows and set down trays before us. The lids were covered but the first scent of it reached my nostrils. It was like standing in a butcher shop. The low scent of iron comes to me and with it the raw and distinct smell of meat.

¬†‚ÄúDo you understand?‚Äù Ekle asks.

¬†‚ÄúNo, no I don‚Äôt!‚Äù James is on the verge of bolting. His wide eyes are glued to the platter before him.

¬†‚ÄúWhatever this is, we gotta eat it,‚Äù Maggie says before she swallows. I know her mind is racing with possibilities of what waits below the tray.

¬†‚ÄúYou must devour the most,‚Äù Ekle corrects her, ‚ÄúThe one that does will be granted audience with Him.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAnd if we quit?‚Äù James asks.

¬†Ekle let the silence speak for her.

¬†‚ÄúFuck,‚Äù James sits back in his seat.

¬†‚ÄúCan we leave?‚Äù a sinking feeling grows in my chest. It blends with the stank building with each second those damn platters stay on the table.

¬†‚ÄúIf you wish to leave, now is the time,‚Äù Ekle motions to the door, ‚ÄúOnce we begin, there will be no time for surrender.‚Äù I grip the table, my knuckles turning white as I look towards the door. 

‚ÄúBut you won‚Äôt leave,‚Äù Ekle‚Äôs voice is a comforting whisper, ‚ÄúSo let us begin.‚Äù

¬†I want to cry as Ekle claps her hands and the servants pull the lids away. The smell nearly causes me to vomit. The thick stench of meat and humidity causes me to recoil.¬† Instinctively, I cover my mouth and nose with my arm in an attempt to block out the smell. In front of me is a pile of meat, and there is no other way to describe it. Tendons are misplaced, veins with leaking blood fall out from random places. Fat builds up on it like a tumor and flesh itself follows no pattern. In spots I can see growths of hair and even eyes that still swivel and turn in their flesh bound prisons.

¬†Across the table one of the men vomits.

¬†Ekle stands with the air of a child who had just shown her parents something wonderful.

¬†‚ÄúA bountiful meal is it not?‚Äù As if to prove her point, she reaches down and plucks off a portion of fat before popping it in her mouth.

¬†I gag again.

¬†‚ÄúPlease, help yourselves.‚Äù None of us move as we are all paralyzed by what lies in front of us. It is Maggie who, after a deep sigh, starts. I watch as she uses her fork to tear off the smallest peace, the sound wet and visceral. Blood and possibly eye fluid come pumping out. She closes her eyes and bites down on it. Her jaw moves in a slow, rigid fashion as she scrunches her face. It takes three swallows for her to force it down. She shudders and twists her neck around before moving back in with the fork.

¬†‚ÄúNot that bad,‚Äù Maggie says between gags.

¬†My knuckles are loose as I grab a fork and tear off a piece. I reveal an eye that quivers as it tries to blink at me. Stands of muscles dangle from it. I have to put it in my mouth and chew it before I can fully take in the contents of the morsel. In my mouth juices and blood gush between my teeth and gums. The taste is exactly that of raw meat. Gristle pops between my molars as I force it down my throat. It tries to come back up, but I won‚Äôt let it. I nearly double over as the final effort sends it into my stomach.

¬†From there the hellish meal continues. Thin blood stains my lips as my teeth slowly turn pink. James stops to slam his fist on the table so that he can think about anything then what's in his mouth. One of the men at the end of the table is barely eating while the other throws up again. He falls below the table and I hear his body heave‚Ä¶only that it doesn‚Äôt stop. It turns into a dry heave for a moment as the last of his stomach empties. Something else comes out. Something wet slaps against the ground and spills across the floor. Maggie locks her eyes forward. If they stray for even a moment she would see his fate. The servants come and drag the body away once he finally goes still. Another sweeps up his dish. Ekle tuts to herself and we continue.

¬†I am not sure where my hand begins and the flesh ends. Every bite slides down into my stomach and I feel the urge to let the bile rise up. I can‚Äôt. The worst of it all is that I am growing used to the meal. I am not savoring it, but I understand when a lone eye bursts in my mouth. I take note of the hair slipping between my lips. I feel the skin slough off of the meat and the layer of cold fat spilling out. Me, James, and Maggie, we look like animals. Blood covers our shirts and faces.

¬†Time does not exist here. There is nothing past the flicking of the torches and the dance of the servants. As my belly grows full with putrid sustenance, the only thing that indicates that there is more beyond the plate, beyond the table, is Ekle. She comes and goes, sometimes pacing, other times watching. She always looks pleased. No matter how much I eat, the plate never empties. Fistful after fistful I force into myself and it never grows lesser. At some point the other man vanishes. He was taken when I wasn‚Äôt looking. I don‚Äôt care, I have to keep going. I see the lost face between every movement of my jaw, every ache of my throat. I see every sign clear as day. I weep, driving myself further and further.

¬†Time is only measured by the stretching of my stomach. It swells with every bite now. I feel pain move across my abdomen as it in turn expands past its point of comfort. The time between bites is starting to slow. As I chew down something purple and yellow that tastes of sand, I see Jamie is slowing as well. Maggie has stopped, her mouth hanging open as chewed meat runs down her face along with drool. She closes her jaw, then opens it again.

¬†I want to encourage her. I want to tell her to keep going, that her happiness is just a few bites away. But I can‚Äôt. I won‚Äôt. I am here for him, not Maggie. She made her choices, she fell to the needle and rush, not me.¬†

¬†I am suffering from something far worse. Maggie shovels another mound into her mouth and without chewing swallows it. For a moment I slow, watching her eyes fade in and out. She moans in pain as she clutches her stomach. A second later her face hits the table.

¬†Whatever life was inside of her shudders as it goes.

¬†The servants drag her away.

¬†‚ÄúD-damn it,‚Äù James's voice is a constant slur now.

¬†I can see it in his eyes. He‚Äôll stop soon.

¬†He knows it.

¬†He fumbles for his phone. His fingers, slick with blood and fluid are unable to grasp it. I take another bite and work my exhausted jaw. Ekle emerges once more at the end of the table. She places her hands on the empty seat. Her head turns to James.

¬†‚ÄúMy sister‚Ä¶my little sister,‚Äù He hits his chest a few times as the food is not down yet, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs sick. Cancer. We can‚Äôt pay for her‚Ä¶‚Äù 

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt,‚Äù My hands tremble for a moment. I have to ignore his eyes, the youthful desperation in them. Tears run down his face as he bangs his hand on the table.

¬†Ekle starts to drum her fingers on the chair.

¬†‚ÄúJust stop! Stop it! She‚Äôs a kid! A kid with her whole life ahead of her,‚Äù He keeps his eyes on me, not on the harbinger, ‚ÄúLet me win‚Ä¶let her live.‚Äù 

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs still alive. You had your chance to make those moments mean something and you wasted it,‚Äù I snarl, ‚ÄúWhat I have is gone. Dead. Nothing. And it‚Äôs my‚Ä¶!‚Äù 

The last word gets stuck in my throat. 

‚ÄúBut she‚Äôs not dead,‚Äù James gets out of his seat.

¬†His movements are slow, drunken. He grabs me by the collar.

‚ÄúSarah! The girl you're about to kill, that's her name! Sarah!‚Äù 

‚ÄúIf you want her to live so bad then eat!‚Äù I grab a wad of flesh and shove it in his face.

¬†¬†He‚Äôs too full, too exhausted to fight back as I force it into his mouth. I grab another hunk and follow it after that. His knee hits my swollen stomach and I nearly lose it all. I shove it in his eyes next time, blinding him. My blood roars in my ears as I cram more and more into his mouth. Soon, he‚Äôs unable to close his jaw. I keep going until it‚Äôs so backed up that the bottom of his throat starts to bulge.

¬†When it‚Äôs done, and the rush fades, I cry. The meat under my fingernails glistens in the torchlight as I put my hands to my face. I feel the body being dragged away and I let it go.

¬†‚ÄúAnd the victor has been chosen. Come, your wish awaits.‚Äù With a movement of her hand, the servants come and lift me off of the ground. Like a messiah they parade me through the chambers of the castle with Ekle at the front of the procession. My vision is starting to fade as a slow pain is reaching across my gut. I groggily move my head to see the end of it. A set of bronze doors make up the end of the hallway. They open without needing to be touched and a cold air fills the corridor. My breath turns to frost in the air as ice crawls across the floor. Ekle stays out of the chamber, holding my hand as I pass. The servants place me in the frigid dark and leave

¬†¬†The doors shut and I see nothing. Alone with my pain and breath, there is nothing I can do except wait.

¬†It is slow at first, the voice. It comes in a trickle before taking shape into a deep rumble that causes my entire body to shake. In the dark, past the voice I hear something dragging across the ground. A step rattles the room, then another. I still see nothing. No shape, not even a silhouette of the horror whose voice is still winding up. The first words slowly take the shape of thunder. They roll across the air and into my ear, licking my ear dreams and caressing my brain.

¬†¬†***‚ÄúThous hast come to mine realm, thou hast gorged thine sorrow and mine flesh. Speak free thy desire and I shalt wave mine hand and make it so, as the light and world hath been made so. Speak, little one, whose crown and right hath been earned. At the end of mine flesh, mine body, mine bread, thou hast found a ripe apple. Bite thy apple, let the juices of succor and fullness walk from the realm of here to the realm of thine. So speak true and speak full, for you stand in the court of The Lord Of Tongues.""***

¬†When it is done speaking, an expecting silence comes. I can hear its bulk shifting around the room, echoing across the frozen stones. Things tear and swallow each other in the dark, giving images of ocean waves crashing on the beach.¬† Worst of all, there is no scent. The air is fresh and cold, like on top of a mountain. I reach out and feel snow fall on my hand, birthed from a place far beyond reality. The Lord Of Tongues is a patient thing. It stirs little as my mind grasps at what is happening.

¬†‚ÄúMy wish‚Ä¶‚Äù I say, my voice barely a whisper. My body seizes before I can say his name. A deeper guilt claws at me just like my swollen stomach. Every breath pushes it forwards. I feel the edges of it start to come undone. In the void, there is nothing but me and the roaring of my mind. It is louder than anything else.¬†

¬†Images of lost smiles, last days wasted, these are the weights across my chest as I try to open it to speak. They push me back down and I writhe on the floor. My fists beat across the frosted stones until I can feel pain. The Lord Of Tongues simply breathes, indifferent to anything beyond its grasp.

¬†‚ÄúSave -,‚Äù I am cut off as my traitor stomach finally ruptures.

¬†The only thing that signals this is the rips of pain across my abdomen, then nothing else. I cannot feel the pain. I cannot feel the lost pieces of meat find new shelter in the depths of my body. I cannot feel the rush of stomach acid as it pours down into my soul. Nor do I feel the blood escaping from one prison to find another.

¬†‚ÄúBring‚Ä¶bring him back.‚Äù No words are said, but I can feel the shift in the air.¬†

¬†It is not enough. I should be there. I should tell him everything I forget to say. Even in this abyss, I can feel my vision start to fade. The Lord Of Tongues is humming. It vibrates the ground in a soothing way, shepherding me into the darkness. I die with many regrets, more than I had when I lived.

Six years later, I do.","Back in 2019 I was a teenager who fell hard for my first real love. It was intense‚Äîthe kind of connection that makes the world look brighter. We liked the same things, had the same energy, and it felt like we were made from the same spark.

But we were young. That intensity turned into control. The person I loved started deciding who I could see and what I could do. I told myself it was fine because I loved him. When he finally ended it, it shattered me. I poured myself into the gym and into distractions, trying to numb the ache.

Eventually I met someone older who looked ‚Äúput together.‚Äù We kept it casual for 5 months, then tried to build something real. Two weeks later I learned he was dealing drugs. He promised he‚Äôd quit. I wanted to believe I could help him change. Instead, I learned the hardest lesson: love can‚Äôt cure lies and addiction. It got worse. He hid things, he used, he hurt me. I involved the police and walked away after far too long. That period took pieces of me I‚Äôm still proud to have grown back.

After that I reached for the familiar and reconnected with my first love. It felt like a missing puzzle piece clicking back in, but life had moved on. The truth is, I had too. I realized the person I used to think was my forever didn‚Äôt fit the person I had become. Letting that go was painful, but it was also clarity.

I tried dating apps. I went on walks, had coffees, and sometimes made choices that didn‚Äôt honor what I really wanted. One day I looked at myself and thought, ‚ÄúWhat am I doing?‚Äù I deleted everything. I stopped chasing love and started choosing me.

And then‚Äîwhen I wasn‚Äôt searching‚ÄîI met someone. A good man. Not perfect. Not a fantasy. Real. He‚Äôd been through his own heartbreak and did the work: new routines, new hobbies, feeling his feelings instead of running from them. We took it slow. We talked, really talked. We learned to be vulnerable and to communicate. I felt myself blooming again after almost six years of staying numb.

A few months in, on a small trip together, I felt it hit me like a warm wave: I love him. I told him. He held it with both hands and said he loved me too. We cried, not because we were lost, but because we had finally been found‚Äîby each other and by ourselves.

Now love feels different. It‚Äôs deep and steady. We have small disagreements because we‚Äôre human, but we try to stay respectful and come back to the table. He cares, shows up, listens, and I do the same. My heart feels peaceful. I finally believe in a future that‚Äôs safe, kind, and exciting.

If you‚Äôre where I used to be‚Äîheartbroken, doubting you‚Äôll ever feel that spark again‚Äîplease hear me: love after chaos is real. Healing is real. You don‚Äôt have to settle for control, lies, or pain. Choose yourself. Do the work. And when love arrives, you‚Äôll recognize it, because it won‚Äôt demand you shrink. It will make room for your whole self. ‚ù§Ô∏è

TL;DR: Teenage love turned controlling. Next relationship turned abusive. I thought I‚Äôd never feel real love again. I focused on healing, stopped chasing, and met a man who loves me with respect and care. It‚Äôs the most beautiful, steady love I‚Äôve ever known. There‚Äôs hope.",1,1759941065.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False
1o1fe0e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Smallyoutubechannels/comments/1o1fe0e/for_small_youtubers_why_you_need_a_professional/,For Small YouTubers: Why You Need a Professional Landing Page (And How to Get One),"Hey everyone,

I've been talking to a lot of smaller creators lately, and I keep hearing the same frustrations:

* **""Brands don't know how to reach me""** \- Your contact info is buried in a YouTube description that nobody reads
* **""I lost a sponsorship opportunity""** \- Because you didn't have a professional way to show your stats and portfolio
* **""Supporters ask how to support me""** \- But you don't have an easy way to accept donations beyond YouTube memberships

Here's the thing: **Big creators have media kits, professional websites, and agents. You need that too.**

# The Problem With Just Having YouTube

Your YouTube channel is great for content, but terrible for:

* Showcasing your full portfolio in one place
* Making it easy for brands to contact you professionally
* Accepting direct support from fans
* Displaying all your social media analytics
* Showing brands your engagement rates and demographics

# What Actually Works

After watching how mid-tier creators operate, here's what you need:

**1. A Professional Landing Page** Think Linktree, but actually professional. Somewhere that shows:

* Your channel stats across all platforms
* A portfolio of your best work
* Easy contact options
* Professional bio and rates
* Ways for supporters to donate

**2. A Place Brands Can Find You** Brands actively search for creators in specific niches. If you're not in their search results, you're invisible - no matter how good your content is.

**3. Simple Monetization Options** Not everyone can join your membership. Sometimes fans just want to buy you a coffee or donate once. Make it stupid simple.

# I Built Something For This (Not Trying to Sell, Just Share)

I got tired of seeing talented small creators miss opportunities, so I've been working on a platform that combines:

* Professional creator profiles (like a media kit)
* A marketplace where brands post opportunities
* Direct donation options for supporters
* Analytics dashboard to track everything

Here's an example of what a creator profile looks like: [https://atiscon.com/@abusayedopu1](https://atiscon.com/@abusayedopu1)

You can create one at: [https://atiscon.com](https://atiscon.com)

**For early adopters:** You'll get premium features for free, permanently. I'm just trying to get feedback and help creators right now.

# What You Get

‚úÖ **Public Profile** \- Professional landing page with all your links, stats, and portfolio  
‚úÖ **Brand Opportunities** \- Get discovered by brands looking for creators in your niche  
‚úÖ **Direct Donations** \- Easy way for supporters to contribute (like Ko-fi but integrated)  
‚úÖ **Analytics** \- Track clicks, views, and engagement  
‚úÖ **Gallery** \- Showcase your best work with photos/videos  
‚úÖ **Messaging** \- Direct line to brands and supporters

# Why I'm Sharing This

Honestly? I'm building this because I've seen too many good creators give up because they couldn't monetize or get noticed. The barrier between ""hobby YouTuber"" and ""professional creator"" shouldn't be having an expensive website or agent.

If you're:

* Under 100K subscribers
* Struggling to land brand deals
* Getting DMs asking ""how can I support you?""
* Wanting to be taken more seriously as a creator

This might help. Or don't use it - I'm just tired of watching talent go unnoticed because they don't have the ""professional setup.""

**TL;DR:** Small creators lose opportunities because brands can't find them or contact them professionally. Having a proper landing page + profile in a creator marketplace makes a huge difference. Built a free tool for this if anyone wants to try it.

Happy to answer questions or hear what's actually stopping you from landing sponsorships. Let's help each other out.

*Note: Yes, I built this platform, but I'm genuinely trying to solve a real problem I see constantly. Early users get premium free forever because I just want feedback and to help creators succeed.*",1,1759941025.0,Smallyoutubechannels,0,1.0,False

I still believe in love, kahit ilang beses na akong nabigo, the kind where you grow with each other and help one another become better.

I appreciate people who communicate well, who listen, and who are kind and grounded. Effort and honesty go a long way for me, and sometimes, it‚Äôs the little things that matter most. If you‚Äôre emotionally mature, know how to respect, and want something sincere but still chill, I think we‚Äôd get along.
