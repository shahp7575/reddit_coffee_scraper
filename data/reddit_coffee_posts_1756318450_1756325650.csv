1n1roxx,https://www.reddit.com/r/indiansinusa/comments/1n1roxx/how_do_you_get_the_creamy_milk_flavor_in_usa/,How do you get the creamy milk flavor in USA ?,"I had forgotten how good Indian milk tastes until I stayed there for 3 weeks this year and had coffee there. I'm trying to recreate that taste. From what I'm told, even whole milk here is only about 5% fat and it's homogenized so the cream doesn't separate even when heated. Also, any brand of Indian milk (especially Chitale) just feels and tastes much thicker.

While trying to reproduce that taste, I have tried regular, whole milk, A2 milk and many different brands (organic valley, horizon organic, etc.). They just taste like water when I make coffee.

I even got malai from an indian store and heavy whipping cream from other stores. These do improve the flavor a little bit but don't come close to it. Also heavy cream is 5-7$ in stores here for a 16 oz pak and it gets finished within 4-5 days at most and might also be a bit unhealthy as it contains too much fat compared to indian milk without improving the flavor as much. That's not sustainable long-term.

1n1ro93,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fire/comments/1n1ro93/took_early_retirement_at_38_and_honestly_the/,Took early retirement at 38 and honestly the social isolation is harder than I expected,"Been FIRE'd for about 8 months now and wanted to share something that caught me completely off guard. I was so focused on the financial aspects (had about 2.1M saved up, 4% rule, all that good stuff) that I totally underestimated how weird it would be socially.  
  
Like most of my friends are still grinding their corporate jobs and when I mention I'm ""retired"" the conversation gets awkward fast. Some seem resentful, others think I'm lying or exaggerating. Had coffee with an old coworker last week and when he asked what I've been up to I just said ""working on some personal projects"" because saying ""nothing much, went hiking Tuesday"" feels like bragging somehow.  
  
The weirdest part is weekday activities. Gym is full of retirees in their 60s+ who are super friendly but we dont have much in common. Coffee shops are mostly remote workers who clearly think I'm unemployed lol. Even simple things like grocery shopping on Tuesday at 2pm feels strange.  
  
Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love the freedom and wouldnt go back to corporate life. Just wish I had thought more about building a social network outside of work colleagues. Been thinking about volunteering or maybe taking some community college classes just to have regular interaction with people.

1n1rioy,https://www.reddit.com/r/CleanSweepers/comments/1n1rioy/why_are_clorox_disinfecting_wipes_still_a_goto/,Why Are Clorox Disinfecting Wipes Still a Go-To for Clean Homes,"Testing out the Clorox Disinfecting Wipes model 10044600600335 was an enlightening experience, especially as someone who frequently battles clutter and messes around the house. These wipes have long been a staple of household cleaning supplies, but I decided to see for myself whether all the hype surrounding them was justified. Going in, I was intrigued by their advertised triple-action cleaning and disinfecting prowess, paired with the convenience of their new moisture-seal lid.

**Design and Packaging**  
The most striking feature I noticed right off the bat was the updated packaging. The container is compact, and the flip moisture-seal lid works beautifully. I‚Äôve tried other disinfecting wipes before, and it can be a frustrating experience dealing with poorly designed lids that dry out wipes prematurely. This new design felt efficient and easy to use in one hand, ensuring each wipe stayed saturated. The packs stack neatly, making storage a breeze in tight pantry spaces or under the sink‚Äîthose seemingly small details matter a lot day-to-day.

**Performance and Effectiveness**  
These wipes truly back their claim of ""cleaning 3x better."" When I tested them on a variety of surfaces‚Äîkitchen counters, bathroom tiles, and even sealed wooden tables‚Äîthey removed everything from fingerprints to greasy smudges with minimal effort. What stood out was their multi-surface applicability. Some cleaners streak badly on stainless steel or sealed granite, but these left every surface gleaming and fresh with no residue. Crucially, they kill 99.9% of germs, including COVID-19 virus, which immediately gave me added confidence in their effectiveness.

[Check Clorox Disinfecting Wipes model 10044600600335 deals on Amazon now.](https://app.womanreview.com/p/b08bkr9yt6/)

**Convenience for Everyday Use**  
Being disposable items, they‚Äôre astonishingly practical for high-traffic areas like kitchens and bathrooms, especially if you‚Äôve got kids or pets around. I found myself reaching for the container constantly‚Äînot just for regular cleaning, but to tackle random coffee spills, mysterious sticky spots my children left behind, and even quick disinfecting after grocery runs. Each wipe dispenses easily and comes saturated just right‚Äîneither dripping nor too dry. However, keep in mind that these are not flushable, so they do add to household waste.

**Positives**  
These are the key highlights I noticed:  
- New flip-top lid keeps wipes fresh longer and ensures one-wipe dispensing.  
- Multi-surface compatibility, working well on stainless steel, granite, wood, and more.  
- Effectively cleans and disinfects, preventing bacteria growth for up to 24 hours.  

**Areas of Concern**  
No product is perfect, and here are the things that caught my attention:  
- Not flushable, which slightly decreases convenience.  
- The fresh scent, while pleasant, might be too aromatic for those sensitive to strong odors.  

**Peer Products**  
Having evaluated similar products like Lysol and Seventh Generation wipes in the past, Clorox wipes stood out due to their exceptional versatility. While Lysol wipes are effective, I‚Äôve found they tend to evaporate quicker in poorly sealed containers. Seventh Generation's plant-based option is excellent for eco-conscious individuals, but they lack the robust germ-killing claims that Clorox offers. Ultimately, Clorox nails that balance between heavy-duty performance and day-to-day practicality.

**Price Performance**  
Considering the features and the variety of surfaces these can tackle, I'd say these offer great value for money. Competitors in the same price bracket often compromise either on effectiveness or convenience, which this product doesn‚Äôt. It might initially seem like a premium cost for cleaning wipes, but factoring in how multifunctional they are and the peace of mind knowing your household is germ-free, they‚Äôre absolutely worth it.

I've been fighting a hopeless and losing battle against an inhuman monstrosity who mains Mai and recently Nine.

I feel most comfortable and familiar with Hakumen, although I believe he is very hard.  
I've been getting better at his combos, and managed to bring my enemy's winrate down to a 99.4%.

From what I understand, Nine is not a good matchup for my monochrome Gigachad. And I can't wrap my head around of what to do with Mai.

From what I know, Mai is top tier, easy to play, can contest god-tier characters like Carl and Rachel, she has guard points on some of her specials and rekka-chains for some reason, she can guard break you for free, her moves are large and quick sweeps that are no match for my slow 4C, my parry does nothing because she stands too far away while poking with spear, she has high damage, she baits your anti-air, almost blinks down, corner carries you from one touch, locks down in the corner, bakes cookies and boils coffee in the morning, what CAN'T she do? Can she fuck my sister as well?

I don't know what to do against this creature, and if Hakuchad is the right character for it.

I've been eyeing and doing challenges on Azrael, because he seems easy enough and has good damage; and also Jubei, because I like his playstyle and may be ADHD gameplay can overwhelm senses of my enemy, who I believe although more experienced, but also slower than me.

Is there a character that would have an easier time beating Mai and Nine? Or may be I should just gitgud and stick with the hard to execute but extremely stylish White Void?",7,1756324870.0,Blazblue,0,1.0,False
1n1rgbd,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1n1rgbd/department_barrows/,Department Barrows,"Department Barrows

Charles works the night shift at Department Barrows.¬† It‚Äôs an unassuming department store located off of Welton Street on the Northwest corner of town.¬† He has worked there for three weeks.¬† They stock wholesale items for cheap, in a much smaller store than a typical Costco.¬† Mind you, the scaffolding all looks similar, ranging straight and narrow red metal shelving forming sequestered isles filled with a variety of consumer products.¬†¬†

Charles has had three different coworkers be replaced during these three weeks of employment.¬† The most recent change was to a twenty year old man named Graham, from a thirty-five year old man named Julio.¬†¬†

There are three problems with night shift, and one will always exacerbate another.¬† The first, is the length of the aisles.¬† They stream for lengths longer and longer the more you look down them. As if space fractures between red metal shelving and white, clean tile.¬† In the daytime, they‚Äôre your typical department store isles, but at night they form a straight labyrinth leading into an unimaginative oblivion. ¬† Second, is the lighting.¬† The lighting will stop working in sections of the aisle.¬† Instead of a muddled shadowy part of the isle, it‚Äôs as if light ceases to exist in these sections.¬† Like a box of see-through mud devours any rays from the humming ceiling lights on either side.¬† You can always see the continuation of the aisle afterwards, and the bitter beginning of the aisle before, but in between it is a nether.¬† The third and final problem is that Charles and his coworkers' sole job is to restock the shelves.¬†¬†

Charles saw Julio be attacked and swallowed by four demonic entities on Monday night. He was restocking protein bar boxes when they swarmed him. Their forms weren‚Äôt creative, they didn‚Äôt hold any mystique or majesty like demons in works of fiction.¬† They were unassuming, made of shadow, with long ligaments that draped and threshed at Julio as he was stripped away into the darkness of an unlit part of aisle four.¬† Julio screamed and scratched at them, but his hands impotently waved through ethereal evil and he was dragged into a section of the dark.¬†¬†

‚ÄúShit.‚Äù¬† Charles muttered, and he went to stock aisle seven which thankfully, was fully lit that evening.¬†¬†

The next few shifts during the week were uneventful for Charles, save for meeting young Graham.¬† He greeted the new hire with a gentle lift of his coffee mug in the staff room, then left to stock his shelves.¬† The white board in the staff room said he was to stock aisle seven today.¬† That, and there have been a proud 3 days without incidence.¬†¬†

On the next day, the current Friday evening, Charles finds he is now tasked with restocking the hardware section, aisle nine.¬† He began his shift by patrolling to the stock room, filling up his cart with a new yield and walking to the associated work area.¬†

There is a section of aisle nine with a light out.¬† The truth is, Charles doesn‚Äôt care.¬† Charles has spent too long around those boring demons, and it‚Äôs now a reflex of his attitude.¬† He‚Äôs seen them, heard them, felt them. He‚Äôs dealt with them long before the Barrows department store.¬† Upon his first few encounters, he laid with the trauma of the moment, boorishly holding his knees to his chest wondering if what he saw was real.¬† Now, he hates them.¬† Charles isn‚Äôt scared. He‚Äôs indignant and angry.¬†¬†

Upon reaching closer and closer to the dark section, Charles is tasked with refilling a section of nails when he feels darkness watching him.¬† Eight, no ten sets of eyes boring into him from all angles.¬† Charles finishes that section and sighs.¬† He puts two hands on his cart and propels it towards the dark.¬† As the tip of his cart hits the darkness, Charles‚Äô body is flung over the handlebars into the cart itself and the wheels propel into nothingness.¬† The strange thing he initially notices as he stares into nothingness,, as light is lost to blackness, is that those evil figures don‚Äôt exist.¬† It‚Äôs just one dark, formless energy.¬† A shadow-like mist envelops the cart, and almost like it‚Äôs propelled by wind the shadow begins tearing past him, like he‚Äôs riding a bike through the smoke of a burning building.¬† All that he can hear is a chorus of ghastly whispers that speak no words, but combine into a deafening, sinister hiss as heavy and obscuring clouds cascade over him.¬† That‚Äôs when he starts to feel his eyes bulge out of his head, just to resocket.¬† His ears pull the flesh on his face until it‚Äôs akin to a rubber mask, only to be snapped back in place.¬† His legs and arms are left unfeelingly numb.¬†

Charles isn‚Äôt scared, he‚Äôs fed up with this circumstance already.¬† He just wants to finish aisle nine and go home.¬† As the wind, shadows and clouds pass over him they begin to press into his body, his back still situated on the products of the cart. He can‚Äôt feel anything underneath him but he can feel the sensation of suffocation nonetheless. He sees shimmers of eyes that open and watch above the pressure.¬† They appear as glum yellow orbs then disappear as quickly as they came.¬† The squeeze is now turning from uncomfortable to drastic, and the speed of the cart becomes faster and faster simultaneously moving nowhere. His face, which still has feeling, is now a discombobulated mess like each of his features is separated into different planes of time only to snap back to the present.¬† The matter of his eyelids corrode, then reshape as they widen.¬† They begin to water, and then the trickling liquid is sucked back into his tear ducts.¬† There is no rhythm to his mutilation, it‚Äôs simply chaos.¬† His cheeks are like plaster being pushed through small spaces, to only spread and fill large spaces afterwards.¬† Charles starts to scream. Only a millisecond of sound comes out, and then the clouds twist into his open mouth.¬† He can‚Äôt breathe, but he keeps screaming regardless in hopes to maybe break through and hear something.¬† He doesn‚Äôt.¬†¬†

Somehow, to Charles, It‚Äôs not a scream of fear.¬† He feels strangely confident that he‚Äôll be leaving this plight soon. It‚Äôs a bellow of his frustration, reminiscent of a parent holding back the arms of an angry toddler.¬† In this state, the demonic whispers surrounding Charles turn into a cacophony of subdued sound. It reminds him of swimming underwater.¬†

The pressure lets up for just a moment, and he lifts his head to see the light on the other side of the darkened aisle.¬†

‚ÄúFUCK‚Ä¶. YOU!‚Äù¬†

He now is declaring a war, his cry is twin chimes clanging against one another in a hurricane.¬† The demons are playing with him, as they let him say the first half of his roar, but as he yelled ‚ÄúYOU,‚Äù the shadows reapplied their weight and propelled themselves into his lungs.¬† In his stubbornness he holds the syllable in a torrent of anger but the more he screams, the more he drowns in his inability to hear it. ¬† The cart begins to move faster and faster, the clouds become heavier and heavier, all the while subduing every sense that made Charles a sentient being. Only to let him up for air, to then be crushed, pulled, stretched, and clawed at again. In a dark eternity, to feel fear and anger, pain, hope, then discouragement.¬†

Charles was the fourth employee to be replaced at Department Barrows.¬† The manager in the morning shift erased the whiteboard in the staffroom.

Are there any books or resources about US workplace culture that might be helpful for a foreigner like myself to understand his perspective? I am looking to work together well and avoid offending him or misrepresenting myself generally.

Hi, I‚Äôm Bonnie, Im 24, black female, 5‚Äô5 | 115lbs, and if I were to describe myself in one word, it would probably be ‚Äúsoft,‚Äù though that‚Äôs just the beginning. I‚Äôm someone who finds joy and comfort in the small, delicate details of life, the things that make each day feel intentional and a little bit magical. I adore quiet, cozy spaces like small caf√©s and bakeries, wandering through little shops with hidden treasures, or simply enjoying a bouquet of flowers that catches my eye. I love the tactile, comforting things that make the world feel gentle: soft cardigans, stuffed animals, comfort shows/movies, bows and hair clips that add a playful feminine touch, and little strawberry-themed surprises that bring a smile. I notice the details, the subtleties, and the moments that many people might overlook, and I think that‚Äôs part of my charm.

At the same time, I have a small, wild streak. I love activity, adventure, and new experiences that let me feel alive. Roller coasters, museums, science exhibits, hiking, and exploring are all things that make my heart race with excitement. I‚Äôm not interested in the typical ‚Äúdinner, coffee, or movie‚Äù dates; I crave experiences that are interactive and engaging, where we can genuinely connect and share energy. I love movement and spontaneity as much as I love stillness and quiet reflection, and I think the balance between those sides of me makes life richer.

I take boundaries, comfort, and consent very seriously. For me, a relationship is about trust, mutual respect, and emotional safety. I am not here for casual texting or low-effort planning or even the ‚Äúlets see where things go‚Äù energy; I want someone who is thoughtful, intentional, and willing to invest the time and energy it takes to build something meaningful. Communication matters deeply to me, and I appreciate partners who are clear, considerate, and confident in themselves. I believe that love and connection flourish when both people are genuinely present, attentive, and willing to put in effort. However with that i am looking for a long term relationship but not ready for marriage or ready to have children, i love being CF (Child Free) and that is really important to me, i value my freedom and not being tied down daily having to take care of a small human. I believe it is possible to want a committed relationship but not be ready to settle down; Sometimes, two people simply share a meaningful connection, whether it lasts a few years or just a beautiful chapter. There‚Äôs something deeply romantic about two separate lives intertwining for a time before continuing their own paths.

I consider myself naturally submissive and kink-friendly (with limits). I‚Äôm drawn to men who are confident, Dominate, grounded, and know how to lead with care and thoughtfulness. I‚Äôm not interested in submissive men (or men with mommy issues. I do not have daddy issues myself) or those who expect me to take control; I feel most fulfilled when I can relax into softness and trust someone to guide our dynamic. For me, submission isn‚Äôt about weakness, it‚Äôs about connection, trust, and intimacy. The most romantic and meaningful relationships I can imagine are ones where I feel safe enough to let go, be soft, and explore the full range of my emotions and desires without fear or judgment or being used.

When it comes to who I‚Äôm attracted to, I tend to gravitate toward single men who are White, East/Southeast Asian, or latino and don‚Äôt have children. Non-Smoker/vaper but drinking is fine just dont be a alcoholic hehe. No crazy Exes. Aged 25-40(no one older or younger). Permanently living in Orlando, FL. Knows how to dress and basic hygiene. Knows how to have a conversation aka won‚Äôt leave me to ask all the question or say ‚Äúfeel free to ask me questions‚Äù when none have been asked of me. Loves theme parks and movies. Have hair on their head (no baldness but a buzzcut is fine). Emotional intelligent. Confidence is key! I admire someone who knows themselves, is comfortable in their own skin, and carries themselves with self-assurance. I appreciate a partner who prioritizes health, whether that‚Äôs staying active, eating thoughtfully, or simply taking care of their well-being. I prefer men who are fit, slim, or average in body type(noone obese), someone whose lifestyle complements mine without pressure or judgment. Height isn‚Äôt everything, but I‚Äôm drawn to men who are taller and carry themselves in a way that inspires quiet confidence and stability, height is not a dealbreaker. I‚Äôm most comfortable when I‚Äôm with someone kind, protective, and intentional. I bring loyalty, affection, and steadiness, I just need to feel safe and chosen first. I would say i have an average body,  but to clear up that im not the average-overweight pipeline im 115lbs.

I love a lifestyle that feels mature, grounded, and intentional. I enjoy healthy routines, cooking at home, and staying active walking, or home workouts. I value thoughtful living, where every choice, big or small; reflects care for yourself and those around you. For me, little things matter: the scent of fresh flowers, the comfort of a soft cardigan on a rainy day, the quiet thrill of discovering something new in a museum, or the tactile satisfaction of a small DIY project. Life feels richer when you notice the details, and I take joy in these moments every day.

Romance, for me, is soft, tender, and deeply intentional. I crave connection that‚Äôs playful yet grounded, adventurous yet comforting. I love giving and receiving affection, cherishing moments where we can simply be together without distraction. My ideal partner values these things too: someone who can plan thoughtful, activity-based dates, who enjoys shared experiences rather than just passive moments, and who delights in the simple but meaningful gestures that show care. I want a relationship where laughter, exploration, and softness are all woven together, a life that feels full and alive while still honoring calm, gentle moments.

 I want to build a relationship that‚Äôs focused and intentional from the start. I‚Äôm looking for someone who can embrace both the playful and serene sides of life, who understands that romance doesn‚Äôt need to be loud or flashy to feel profound. I value someone who can lead with strength but also sensitivity, someone who can take initiative in planning our time together while respecting my boundaries and comfort. I want a partner who sees the beauty in both quiet moments and bursts of adventure, someone who can make everyday life feel like something special.

There‚Äôs a balance in me that I hope to share with the right person. Together, I imagine a relationship that‚Äôs warm, exciting, and deeply connected: moments of quiet reflection curled up together, intertwined with spontaneous adventures that make us feel alive. I am a spiritually grounded Catholic and love my calm soft faith, i dont force my religion upon anyone and i dont even talk about it to avoid making people uncomfortable. It doesnt matter to me what religion or spirituality you are just come with acceptance and peace. I am LGBTQ+ friendly and myself is Pansexual. However i do not support the poly/enm lifestyle when it comes to my relationships. I dont smoke or drink. I have a chronic illness and take care of myself to make sure my health stays in check. I am not into hookup culture (fwb, ons, play partner, etc) but have tried it out before realizing and talking to my therapist that it is not for me and something i dont enjoy. I take my mental health very seriously and let go of anything that will cause me great stress or put me in a negative mindset. 

I have healed through my trauma and continue to heal far beyond, i want my partner to also prioritize their mental health and can communicate their thoughts and feelings for anything good or bad, i hear and see my partner and make sure to provide my support and feedback, even in disagreements. I would consider myself slightly traditional in relationships following behind my partner and keeping quiet when needed (i do have rules/boundaries myself and dont tolerate any type of disrespect to my character). I would not consider myself a feminist however i do applaud the efforts and the ways things go by and how i would not be able to do the things i do now without feminism. I still believe in equal rights for all not only one type of person. I am not a liberal or conservative and consider myself of the far left and moderate. I prefer to date someone who is moderate/left and also not a conservative/liberal. I enjoy gloomy weather, slice of life anime, nature, animals, dressing very dolly and/or comfortable, and collecting stuffed animals (no squishmellows). I own a cat and dog and live with roommates. I dont drive as i dont meet florida requirements for a DL (passenger princess). I play video games (PS 4/5). I enjoy also dressing modest, a small bit of baking and naps. Im prochoice. And i dream of moving to the PNW and opening up a bakery and having my own greenhouse vegetable and fruit garden in the backyard hehe. I like listening to nu-metal/rock, mitski and Billie eilish. I am not a fan of RnB/hip hop music but I did grow up listening to it. I have Autism and adhd. I work Full Time.

I want someone who understands that relationships take effort and attention from both sides, and who is willing to create a connection built on trust, playfulness, and softness. I want a partner who can inspire me, challenge me gently, and hold space for me while allowing me to be my full, authentic self.

If you‚Äôre someone who enjoys activity-based adventures, who values thoughtful planning, and who appreciates both softness and subtle sparks of wildness, we might just click. I‚Äôm looking for someone confident, grounded, and intentional; someone who respects boundaries, takes comfort seriously, and understands that love is nurtured through care and presence. With the right person, I imagine a life full of warmth, trust, laughter, and connection, moments where we explore the world together, savor the quiet times, and let the soft, tender side of life bloom fully.

(also pls keep in mind english is not my first language, so i might misuse some words or phrases and there may be some typos.)

today i actually want to talk about this: what if fazbear entertainment originally founded by and belonged to edwin murray sr.?

i know. it sounds crazy. but i need you to hear me out.

i was actually watching the unwithered truth's theory video (secret of the mimic solves ultimate custom night) and at 31:13 they said that william and henry didn't found fazbear entertainment. and it just... stuck with me. 

for years we've speculated that fazbear‚Äôs was the great project of william and henry, the result of a partnership that eventually led to the complete downfall of so many lives, including their own families.

but, is that really the case? as far as i know, we have no solid confirmation on this. (actually, a side note here: i do believe that fazbear entertainment that established in 1983 is theirs. but the concept of fazbear's altogether is not.)

what if, william and henry were actually employees in edwin sr.'s fazbear entertainment, and when he died they bought it from edwin we know? (he's going to be referred as edwin jr. throughout this post btw.) maybe they convinced him that how this would help his work get lighter and edwin jr. sold it to them. all of these actually explain why edwin sr. warned edwin jr. about william and henry. he might know something about them, something unsettling.

so that means, murray's costume manor was already a thing, and edwin jr. did not convert something else to it. this would explain why the original freddy's gang we know already exists in mcm. (chica, foxy, freddy etc.) it was already a murray business!

this means that throughout the FNAF series, we‚Äôve seen three separate incarnations of ‚Äúfazbear entertainment.‚Äù

the first one is the we see sotm, established sometime in the 1950s (see: fredbear's singing show poster) and it stayed in business for 20 or more years, probably up until 1983.

the second one began in 1983 (faztokens from ucn, hw, ruin) and it operated until the events of the pizzeria simulator. (after henry says ""end communication"", the narrator states that ""fazbear entertainment is no longer a proper company."") this is THE fazbear entertainment, the one that we saw in the original games. (1-6)

the third one is what we see post-ffps, starting with help wanted. is it still operational? I honestly don‚Äôt know but probably not.
what kind of company would abandon its greatest project -the pizzaplex- and just... leave it rot? i know how it's heavily theorized (and kind of accepted?) that the whole pizzaplex was running with m1/f10-n4 and with princess quest arcades we just deleted the last piece out of the system. (or should i say from vanessa's system?) i know. and i'm totally on your side on this.
but still, this project probably cost them millions. no company in the great century of capitalism would do this. 

also, another thing that bothered me about sotm is the fact that there is a prototype freddy's location UNDER the murray's land. it's not like that the restaurant was going to open under an already-existing facility, right?

for example:
if I were opening a coffee shop, i would want to try out the layout i had in mind at the coffee shop, not under someone‚Äôs house or a company building or something???

unless ""freddy fazbear's pizza"" project was already in development when edwin sr. was alive. and our boys william and henry picked it up from there. (also i'm not going to talk about my silly little theory which contains william killing edwin sr.<3) 

this would also explain why they made changes to things that were already there, like scrapping fiona‚Äôs characters (monty, bub, etc.) which edwin was so upset about.
and why those characters weren‚Äôt around to begin with.

this might seem like a stretch and i probably missed one thing or two. but just wanted to put it out here to discuss it. also i have no idea if i'm the first one to come up with this idea (like i said this is my first time here and i usually only watch theories on youtube lol) but if anyone else shared something similar, i'd love to hear their version.üíñ

that's all i got for now, so... thanks 4 reading.ü´∂üèª",3,1756323717.0,fivenightsatfreddys,0,1.0,False
1n1qygk,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1n1qygk/lost_my_hearing_and_i_still_experience_pain_due/,Lost my hearing and I STILL experience pain due to a work injury almost a year later. Workers comp denied and was called a liar,"Location: New Hampshire

This work incident took place almost a year ago now, back in January 2025. 
 
I briefly worked for the coffee/donut mega chain that we all know can never make our coffee the same way twice, and I have lost hearing and STILL experience pain in one ear due to a coworker screwing around on shift. 
No supervisor or manager was on duty that night. This coworker played a sound from Tik Tok through our headsets which created a feedback loop, nearly blowing out my eardrum. 

I reported the incident and went to an Urgent care center 5 days later, as the pain persisted and I did not regain hearing. They prescribed me medication to help with the pain caused by inflammation and set a follow up appointment for a week later. I reported the update back to my manager the next day who said I‚Äôd have to speak with the regional manager about the events that occurred. 

A few more days later (before even having my follow up), I met with my manager and regional manager behind closed doors of our office (which I did not request. The office is literally like a broom closet). I explained to them both what had happened, and after I‚Äôd finished, they gave me a Dunkin branded acknowledgement paper outlining THEIR version of the events that occurred. No mention of anything I had said, and this paper was already ready to go before I stepped in that office. I had to sign it before our meeting could adjourn. 

I remember my manager clear as day telling me, ‚ÄúI just can‚Äôt make the paperwork fit‚Äù. This paper they‚Äôd written up stated that they would not be giving me any sort of compensation, and that this event didn‚Äôt occurred. They told me that I had an ear infection based off of the medication I was prescribed to treat the pain. Nobody was held accountable. Just me. 

Over the next week, the manager made my shifts hell, actively avoided me, and changed my schedule which cut my hours from a consistent 32, to 18, to 12. It was blatantly obvious that she was targeting me after I reported this work incident. I couldn‚Äôt take the shit anymore and quit a week after I reported my injury. 

The follow up appointment only further confirmed that I had experienced ear trauma caused by sound. I explicitly asked about the ear infection nonsense and the doc confirmed‚Ä¶ no ear infection was, or had ever been present. I was supposed to see a specialist for my ear, which was supposed to be provided by the employer. They denied me everything before even knowing I‚Äôd have to see a specialist. I never saw one because I can‚Äôt afford it on my own. I‚Äôm seeing one soon because this is ongoing pain, and I no longer care about the hefty bill I‚Äôm about to acquire. I‚Äôd prefer my hearing back. 


This is the jist of the situation, please ask away if anything is confusing or info seems missing. 

I‚Äôve never dealt with legal stuff before, so I have questions. 

1. Do I have to hire a lawyer from the same state that the incident occurred in or that I live in? (This happened in NH, but I‚Äôm moving next month out of state)

2. Do I have any hope in even pursuing a case?? I‚Äôve contacted a handful of attorneys and The NH dept of labor, all of which seemed dismissive and uninterested.

3. What documents/proof would really help me build my case? 

4. What kind of case would this be categorized as? Employer negligence? Workers comp? Discrimination? All?? Is that possible??

5. Who to ‚Äúgo after‚Äù? All in one case? Is that possible? I have a list of individuals and the franchisee/company

6. If this goes anywhere in my favor, can I get my medical expenses paid back? Pain and suffering? Lost wages (I was out of work for 6 months after this. It really messed me up mentally)?

Thank you for any and all feedback! Much appreciated. I may edit or comment with more questions. Be well all!",1,1756323687.0,legaladvice,1,1.0,False

In the town of Anniston, Alabama, visitors can sit and stare‚Äîliterally‚Äîat the world‚Äôs largest office chair. Towering at over 33 feet (10 meters) high, this steel-framed behemoth doesn‚Äôt exactly fit behind a desk. It was built in 1981 by Miller‚Äôs Office Furniture, intending to make a bold, attention-grabbing statement‚Äîand one that would stick.

Certified by Guinness World Records, the chair weighs over 2,000 pounds and stands proudly in the company‚Äôs original parking lot. For human-scale comparison? This chair is as tall as a three-story building and could theoretically seat a T. rex, were it applying for a desk job. The massive structure has been repainted and restored multiple times, proving that even a giant chair needs a bit of polish now and then.

It‚Äôs more than just furniture; it‚Äôs a local icon, bringing in tourists tired of cookie-cutter attractions. Whether snapping selfies at its base or wondering how many Post-it notes it‚Äôd take to fill such a workspace, folks agree‚Äîit‚Äôs oddly inspiring.

Got a record you want measured next? Whether it‚Äôs the fastest kettle-boiled coffee or the longest game of hopscotch ever played, the world‚Äôs most remarkable feats often start with a simple idea and the guts to make it real.",2,1756323670.0,ForbiddenFacts101,0,1.0,False
1n1qx5k,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1n1qx5k/supplements_especially_for_the_winning_pmsadhd/,Supplements (especially for the winning PMS/ADHD combo),"In addition to stimulant medication and what I have already been trying to manage PMDD-like symptoms late in my menstrual cycle, I would like to consider some supplements for ADHD and PMS/PMDD and am also interested in good foods to try to incorporate. I also try hard to use behavioral interventions like meditation, exercise, fidgets, mindfulness, I'm in therapy, etc...

I recently increased my stimulant dose a little, which I only decided to do (in consultation with my doctor) after experimenting with it for several weeks. Nonetheless, now that I've been taking that higher dose for a little while, in addition to improved/more consistent ADHD symptom management (which is why I wanted to increase my dose), I have also been noticing some new side effects: feeling a little edgier particularly in the morning (not as bad as when not on meds), some minor trouble with sleep, fatigue when I don't take meds on the weekends, etc. I also really, really struggle emotionally and otherwise during PMS and my period, and what I have been trying (small short-term estradiol (estrogen) dose) isn't working super great. I am open at this point to trying SSRIs for PMDD and/or exploring other forms of birth control to see if that helps, but supplements seem like a good place to start.

I have heard/seen good things about the following supplements and would love to know thoughts/experiences or if I've missed anything:
- Vitamin D: I should already be taking this anyway, as, even though I spend a decent amount of time in the sun, especially in the warmer seasons, blood tests always show I'm deficient.
- Magnesium: Supposedly, this is really safe and has lots of benefits, including sleep support.
- Omega 3s (of course)
- Valerian root: Suggested specifically for PMS and ADHD in this article: https://www.jeffersonhealth.org/your-health/living-well/8-supplements-that-can-help-reduce-anxiety-according-to-a-psych
- Ashwagandha: decreases cortisol, which I know stimulant use can elevate. 

I have also heard it's super important to get enough protein to help support executive function, and I've certainly observed this to be true of me. Definitely need to try to start my day with a decent amount for my meds to work well.

I'm also wondering about my use of caffeine. After cutting it out almost entirely when I first started taking stimulants (at a slightly lower dose than I'm at now), I was eventually able to add a morning cup of coffee back in, and a smaller amount (like a soda or green tea) in the afternoon without noticing sleep or other issues. But I'm wondering whether I should switch back to decaf or half-caf and avoid it entirely in the afternoon. 

I'm also just wondering whether I was really better off overall on my lower stimulant dose, and whether adding in some of these supplements could help with the additional symptom relief that made me want to up my stimulants in the first place.

Ideally, I want to start with just one or two basic, super safe supplements and only add more as needed and in consultation with medical professionals.",1,1756323602.0,adhdwomen,2,1.0,False

There are a ton of posts on here (all valid) that talk about how rough things are weeks and months after quitting so I thought it may be beneficial to share my story to show that some people are able to bounce back more quickly. 

I (27F) was a daily vape user for about 7 years before switching to Zyn in early 2024 for health reasons. What started off as something to alleviate cravings while drinking alcohol descended into using throughout the day at work and at home. I'd say I'd probably average around 4 on a day where I wasn't drinking and between 6-8 on days or evenings where I was. Anyway, I've struggled with anxiety, shakiness, GI issues, etc. the past few years and figured that maybe nicotine was playing a hand in that.

The first week was agonizing. My anxiety was already flaring up around the time I quit so that + the nicotine withdrawals made me feel so anxious and untethered I thought I might need to be institutionalized. The inability to sleep through the night was killer. Days 3-4 were probably the worst, but from there things started to get better gradually. I avoided alcohol for the first week but now I'm able to have a glass of wine or cup of coffee without too strong of a craving. 

Some things that have helped me: Using chewing gum when cravings strike, eating healthier & being more physically active (in the evening to tire me out before bed) & taking an antihistamine before bed while I was still having sleep issues. If you're like me and were pretty lazy before quitting, it's a great opportunity to shake things up and adopt healthier habits generally. 

Today I feel the best I've felt in a long time. I'm sleeping better and feel more productive at work. It takes the brain a while to recalibrate, so I won't be surprised if I have some bad days or weeks in the following months. Still, I know that it'll get easier and I'm very glad I made the choice to quit. To everyone else thinking about quitting or in the process of doing so: you got this!

Okay I'm going to try and keep this as concise but detailed as possible

Aug 9th - she breaks up with me over a fight about something minuscule. I didn't react, but honestly I was just so numb that I had no willpower or energy to cry. I went home and by the time I woke up the next day (barely slept lol) I was blocked everywhere. **I knew I wasn't powerless, that I had manifested her once and could do it again, but I still felt pretty shitty**

Aug 15th - I sign up for a free trial on some coaching I used to do. It felt like a sign bc he opened this coaching for FREE (which he's never done) right as we broke up. I joined and started using the exercises to align myself again. these did like 20% of the work

The other 80% was things I had done the previous year: SATS and scripting. I wrote my desire on a piece of paper and read it 3x a day at least, though I often read it more. Probably like 20 lol

The same day I joined the trial, she unblocked me on instagram!! So I knew movement was happening

I stayed consistent with the SATS and the paper. in the SATS she was telling me how stupid she was and that she regretted breaking up with me the minute she did it! I didn't have a scene or anything it was really just those words in her voice ringing over and over again

Aug 21st - She reaches out via text!! Idk if she blocked my number at some point but we had not spoken at all since our breakup. The text was something mundane about me having one of her things. I replied pretty shortly. I didn't give her a ton of my energy. Then right after she told me she missed me!! And she was out of town but wanted to know if I was open to seeing her when she got back

I was EXCITED OBVIOUSLY but I didn't show it. I just said ""I'm okay with that. Let me know the details"" and put the ball in her court. She told me to meet her at a coffee place we went to and gave me the time

Aug 23rd - she is back in town and I meet her. She opens up IMMEDIATELY by hugging me and saying that she's sorry because she's sure the past few weeks had been rough on me. I tell her I've been managing and ask how she's doing

She went to go visit her old college friends and she tells me that it felt weird being without me, and her friends talked her out of the breakup. She was hopeful that I would hear her out...because she was ""REGRETFUL AND FELT STUPID FOR DOING IT!"" The exact words I planned!!

I remained a bit aloof until the next day when we officially decided to get back together!!

1n1qne3,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1n1qne3/ur_mf_commuted/,[UR] [MF] Commuted,"The laptop's fan whirrs incessantly. The hum of sterile office chatter is the only thing more insidious than that idle tool purporting to cool itself. 5 o‚Äôclock arrives and with it the daily exodus and ritualistic end-of-day pleasantries.¬†

‚ÄúAny plans for the weekend?‚Äù

My colleague enquires, as she has done every Friday since I joined the company six months ago. With each rendition of her weekly refrain the vivacity of her delivery dwindles. I admire her politeness but I cannot stomach the insincerity. I can taste the blandness of my response as it reluctantly trickles out. In recent weeks she has taken to staring down blankly at her phone as I speak. I wonder if she even hears me. Perhaps she would if I had something interesting to say.

My walk from the office to the station is accompanied by tides of anonymous others. We trudge by the offices and apartment blocks. The sunlight fractures between the tall buildings and I find myself slowing. I pause for¬†a moment and glance skyward. An act of defiance against the swathes of harried commuters. Soon my stillness is disturbed.

""Can I help you sir? Are you lost?‚Äù

The stranger's question triggers an increasingly familiar tightness in my chest. The sun‚Äôs blistering heat intensifies. Already¬†sweating through my dark suit, I feel my heart rate rise, my skin itch, I become acutely aware of my shirt's collar. The polite assailant is an older man. He appears implacably calm. I lose myself in wonder at the courage and generosity of his approach.

""I'm fine. Thanks‚Äù.

Add that to my prolific record of glancing blows of spontaneous connection. Did I even look into his eyes? I feel his on my back as I continue to the station. My chest loosening as I take comfort in various reimaginings of the encounter. Whispered performances of dozens of increasingly perfect untruths.

It takes eleven and a half minutes to get from the office to the platform. I arrive with my train due in six minutes. The arched steel beams of the station‚Äôs roof tremor with the anxious clamour of the frenzied hoards below. I assess the queue at the coffee kiosk to determine if I have sufficient time for my customary commuter‚Äôs cup. It comprises two middle-aged men, both likely to produce simple, quick orders. I estimate sixty seconds for each of them, giving a low risk of jeopardising my catching the train. The first of my kiosk acquaintances sports a meticulously curated outfit, a subtle blue pinstriped suit paired with brown loafers and matching briefcase. He carries that unmistakeable air of senior managerial authority; assuredness without pretence or showmanship. He orders with that same quiet confidence.

‚ÄúCup of tea to go please, milk no sugar.‚Äù

A classic, non-performative choice from Manager Pinstripe, delivered with the nonchalant charisma of a revered wartime politician. My throat dries as I fervently examine the phrasing of my own order. Pinstripe is served efficiently, well within the estimated schedule.

Acquaintance number two has a shifty demeanour. He fidgets with the strapping on his aging backpack. I catch him glancing at the departure board seven times in the few minutes I stand behind him. I feel a kinship with him as I observe his visible discomfort within the bustling train station.¬†

‚ÄúAh‚Ä¶ bottle of water‚Ä¶please‚Äù.

Shifty Backpack stammers. As he turns to glance at the departure board once more, I catch his gaze. His eyes appear hollow. Vapid. My kinship turns to pity. Backpack collects his water. Four minutes until the train arrives.

I step forward to the counter, attempting to channel my inner Pinstripe. Blas√©. Detached. Worldly. Backpack‚Äôs awkward anxiety has put me at ease by comparison. And this is not my first rodeo; I am an expert at ordering medium black americanos. ¬†

‚ÄúOne medium black americano to go please.‚Äù

The barista does not look up. My carefully curated offhand smile goes unnoticed. My jaw muscles tighten as I imagine how he would have responded had he taken the time to appreciate my work - charmed by my deft mastery of facial expression. He goes to work on my coffee and I habitually reach for my phone, seeking the safety of that sweet technological abyss. The algorithm pulls me in, and I routinely capitulate. A comedian. A laughing baby. A foreign land in crisis. Your coffee sir.

‚ÄúYour coffee sir!‚Äù

I‚Äôm awoken by the brash call of the barista. Accompanied by the dispassionate drone of the station PA.

‚ÄúThe next train leaving from platform 17 will be the‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†

Fuck! I have scrolled for three minutes and the train‚Äôs arrival is imminent. I lunge to grab my coffee and pivot in the direction of the platform. My fitted suit groaning under the strain of the abrupt movement.

The flimsy disposable cup does little to insulate my hand from the boiling liquid within. My temperature rises as I stride through the station. Crossing the concourse. Tourists fumble at the ticket machines, blind to my urgency. A drop of searing hot coffee escapes through the lid‚Äôs aperture and onto my thumb. I approach the platform to find the train has not yet arrived - my stride slows to normal and I take my first scalding sip.¬†

As I gasp to cool my parched tongue I notice my fellow passengers are congregating unusually at one end of platform. Thirty or so people agitatedly moving towards a growing gathering in this small space. Some appear to be moving in such haste that they are leaving their luggage strewn along the platform. A woman stands with her hands to her temples, head shaking with palpable dismay. Another peels away from the crowd with a look of horror on his face. A teenager cranes on tiptoe, phone aloft, attempting to record whatever is transfixing the thronged travellers. I move towards the scene with some other latecomers and hear a raised voice from within the crowd. I cannot make out the words above the echoed cacophony of station chatter.¬†

As I get closer the voice becomes audible. It is familiar but I cannot yet place it.

‚ÄúWhatever you are going through, this is not the solution. You don‚Äôt have to do this‚Äù.

The words are spoken firmly. Sincere, and passionate, but without hysteria. I protectively clutch the coffee to my chest with both hands as I sidle through the group in the direction of the voice. The speaker‚Äôs briefcase sits upright on the floor behind him, suit jacket draped over it. Standing tall at the very edge of the platform, is Pinstripe. I track his gaze downwards. Backpack.

We‚Äôre coming to Montreal in a few weeks and can‚Äôt wait to eat our way through the city. The only catch is we‚Äôll have our 2-year-old with us, so we‚Äôre trying to balance family-friendly spots with actually getting to experience the food scene.

Couple things:

* Early dinners work best for us (toddler bedtime).
* Looking for restaurants that are chill with kids but still worth it for the food.
* Also, any must-hit coffee spots? We‚Äôre big coffee people and that‚Äôs usually how we kick off our day.

I know some of the more ‚Äúbig name‚Äù spots might not make sense with a toddler, but hoping there are good in-between options where we won‚Äôt feel out of place but can still get a taste of Montreal.

Thanks in advance for any recs!

But tonight I had moment that I can‚Äôt believe myself. So I was taking walk at usual place where there are like 3 coffee bars. And I saw his motorbike. Now this usually would not make me stop and stare it but I notice that helmet was hanging from his motorbike. This got me thinking of the time we were together how he would put his helmet inside, while mine would hang. So he was with someone. I suddenly started to panic and started to think how he was on date. I hide somewhere from far away and waited to see if he is gonna show up, but I couldn‚Äôt wait for so long, so I gave up.

I just feel so shitty. He didn‚Äôt show any sign of dating someone else (and if he did I doubt it would last since he is emotionally unavaiable but anyways). He could be with his friends since he always with some guy outside. I think I notice where he was and there was another guy with him. But no, my mind goes straight to the worst.

she was becoming close with her partner‚Äôs friend group, and she spent a lot of time with them and said they were awesome. which is great! i‚Äôm happy for her! but we started seeing each other less and less. and whenever we‚Äôd see each other, she‚Äôd spent a lot of time talking about how awesome her other friends are. and i‚Äôm not saying that she‚Äôs ‚Äúnot allowed‚Äù to have other friends, duh! but it did kind of bum me out because she stopped putting in as much effort into our friendship. fast forward‚Äî she asks me to be one of her only bridesmaids in her wedding, and in that process, i felt us growing distant. the wedding was beautiful. 

after they got married though, there was a shift in her that she seemed so much to be seeking her husbands approval. she only laughed when he laughed, moved when he moved. and the few times i was invited to hang out with their friend group, she did not make much of an effort to include me or talk to me. i felt like an outsider (and i was trying to make conversation with the other girls, it just wasn‚Äôt going well). on top of everything, her life did and does not reflect the one she told me many times she wanted. 

and this summer in particular i felt distance between us and finally i told her how i was feeling and she said she didn‚Äôt feel that way at all and was sorry that i was. we had a nice catchup and heart to heart but i still left feeling not as great as i wished i had. i just feel like i don‚Äôt know her anymore. 

i‚Äôm saying all this to see if anyone has experienced this and has some advice, or can help me figure out why i feel so sad. and also, i am getting married in the spring and wanted to ask her to be one of my bridesmaids, but now i feel uncertain.

1n1qb4o,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/1n1qb4o/i_cant_bring_myself_to_do_anything/,I can't bring myself to do anything,"For context, I was a very ambitious and diligent student from sec 1 to mid sec 4, consistently scoring between raw 6-8. I wanted others to think highly of me and also had goals I wanted to achieve so naturally I worked hard to get the grades that I got.

However, a month before prelims (olvls) started, I started to procrastinate more and eventually stopped studying all together. My grade doubled for prelims and I ended up scoring way below expectations for o levels (nett 10). I really wanted to get into raffles or hci, but ultimately barely scrapped into a mid tier jc. 

Honestly I was pretty devastated about my o level results (since 3.5 years of hard work and consistency was wasted by my own lack of discipline) so I made it my goal consistently do well in jc, and get 70rp to redeem myself from o levels. 

Despite this, I've been nothing short of a terrible student in jc. For essentially the entirety of J1, I didn't complete most of my tutorials, didn't watch lectures, stared into nothingness (?) during lessons, and consistently scored around 45-49rp for WAs, which was considerably lower than most of my classmates. I barely promoted with a EEED/BB. 

It wasn't like I didn't care about my grades, in fact it was the one thing that stressed me out the most, and no matter now much planning, how many study methods or motivational videos I watched, the moment I sat at my desk to start studying, I'd just sit there and stare at the wall. I literally couldn't bring myself to start? 

In J2, I started scoring ever so SLIGHTLY better (~50rp) by paying attention in class and starting tuition for one of my H2s, but I'm still unable to start studying in my own time. I'll organise my notes, rewrite my to-do list for the fucking god knows how many millionth time and make myself coffee but I'll never start studying. Stress over my grades and future has made me break out, lose hair, lose my period, develop insomnia and more, but I STILL don't do anything to change my grade.

I have to sit for prelims today and I've essentially done no prep at all. I'm just feeling very lost, I feel like even the worst students have already gotten a wake up call and I haven't even left the starting line yet.

That said, I still have things that I want to achieve and desired uni courses that need essentially a perfect grade to get into. I'm kind of trying to gaslight myself into thinking that it's not too late lol

Could anyone please give me some advice on how to get started, or what I should do to at least just get moving.. I know there's only less than 3 months left, and I really want to give it my all so that I don't regret it later. ",1,1756322187.0,SGExams,4,0.66,False

1n1q686,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeApplianceHelp/comments/1n1q686/find_out_if_the_best_electric_kettle_aarke_1244/,Find Out if the Best Electric Kettle Aarke 1244 Is Worth It,"Testing out the Aarke 1244 Kettle has been quite an experience, and it deserves some words from someone who's gone through the ups and downs of living with it. Being someone who doesn‚Äôt start their day without a cup of tea, an electric kettle is an essential part of my routine. This kettle, with its sleek steel design and compact look, surely caught my eye. It‚Äôs been a daily part of my mornings and evenings, and I‚Äôve got plenty to share about its performance, features, and quirks.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Right out of the box, the stylish and minimalistic design of this kettle is impressive. The 360¬∞ swivel base lets me place it in any direction, which makes it handy to use, especially around family or friends when everyone‚Äôs reaching for the kettle. It‚Äôs made with a stainless steel finish that not only looks modern but feels durable. The compact dimensions (5.5‚ÄùL x 7.5‚ÄùW x 10.6‚ÄùH) are a win for smaller kitchens, fitting perfectly on any counter without taking over the space. On the downside, at 5.61 pounds, it‚Äôs a tad heavier than some other models I‚Äôve used, which might make it less ideal for someone looking for a lighter appliance.  

**Performance and Features**  
Using this kettle feels like operating a well-oiled machine. It boils water quickly, and it‚Äôs definitely one of the quieter kettles I‚Äôve tried. Thanks to the double-wall construction, heat stays where it should‚Äîinside. I especially noticed that the exterior doesn‚Äôt get scalding hot, making it relatively safer if kids are running around. The dry boil protection is another standout feature; it switches off the heat automatically if there‚Äôs little to no water, a reassuring safety net if you‚Äôre multitasking.  

[Check Aarke 1244 price on Amazon.](https://cyberlyber.com/p/b0cwhk6xzp/)  

**Ease of Use**  
One of the biggest wins for this product is its usability. The non-drip spout is designed beautifully, ensuring each pour is smooth and without spilling, making it nearly foolproof. The lid opens softly and doesn‚Äôt splash water droplets, which I appreciate during rushed mornings. However, this kettle is labeled as ""manual,"" and while it‚Äôs straightforward to operate, don‚Äôt expect additional bells and whistles like temperature controls or LED indicators. For someone who loves ultimate control over their tea or coffee brewing, the lack of variable temperature settings might feel limiting.  

**Strengths**  
- The sleek and durable stainless steel design is both aesthetic and functional.  
- Quiet operation with effective heat retention simplifies kitchen routines.  
- Safety features such as dry boil protection add extra peace of mind.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- It‚Äôs heavier than expected, which might not suit everyone.  
- The lack of temperature control makes it less versatile for specialty teas or brews.  

**Product Rivals**  
In comparison to other brands like Breville or Cuisinart, the Aarke model takes a strong stance with its design and quality. Breville, for example, often offers models with advanced features like variable temperature settings. Still, they tend to lose marks when it comes to size efficiency. Cuisinart, on the other hand, features lightweight models, though they might sacrifice some sturdiness as a trade-off. Aarke‚Äôs steel kettle seems like the sensible choice if durability and aesthetic are at the top of your list. However, if you‚Äôre a coffee connoisseur or tea enthusiast who wants precision, the competition might offer more specialized options.  

**Money‚Äôs Worth**  
The price point for this kettle feels justified for what it offers, though it‚Äôs not aiming to be a budget-friendly option. You‚Äôre paying for the premium build and design, not necessarily extra utility features or add-ons. If aesthetics and build quality are your top priorities, it feels worth the investment. There are cheaper electric kettles out there, but few achieve this level of sleek minimalism paired with efficiency.

They sedated me using a combination of propofol, ketamine, fentanyl, and one other drug (I can't remember what it was now, I asked when I woke up in the recovery room and it's a bit fuzzy now). I just remember going into the operating room with an IV port already in, they were like okay you're going to feel a bit of cold or tingling going up your arm, that's normal, and next thing I knew I woke up in the recovery room and a nurse was asking me how I was feeling.

I talked that poor recovery room nurse's ear off!!! I could not shut up, I was chattering away like I'd just slammed 4 cups of coffee.

Review Inside!,"The Imusa GAU-18234 Electric Espresso Maker has been occupying a prime spot on my kitchen counter for a few weeks now, and I‚Äôve brewed countless cups with it. As a devoted fan of espresso, I couldn‚Äôt resist putting this cast aluminum coffee maker through its paces. With its sleek black design and brown-tinted tritan top, it certainly looks appealing. It promises the ability to brew flavorful espresso in 3-cup or 6-cup configurations with ease. While it has mostly lived up to expectations, there are a couple of quirks worth noting.

**Aesthetic Appeal and Build Quality**  
The espresso maker is crafted with a stylish black cast aluminum base that radiates durability. Combined with its modern design and tinted top, it easily complements a variety of kitchen setups. The cool-touch handle is a thoughtful addition, making it safe to pour freshly brewed coffee. One thing I appreciate is its lightweight build, clocking in at just 2.72 pounds. It‚Äôs easy to handle while sturdy enough to withstand daily use. However, the aluminum might show signs of wear over time, especially with frequent washes.  

**User Experience and Simplicity**  
This electric espresso maker earns high marks for its ease of use. Brewing is straightforward: fill the lower tank with water, add your ground coffee to the funnel, and set the carafe on the detachable base. Pressing the simple, one-touch on/off button gets the process started, and there‚Äôs a visual indicator to monitor brewing. I especially value its beginner-friendly nature; even my sister, who avoids overly complicated machines, managed to whip up a decent brew. 

**[Grab Imusa GAU-18234 at the best price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0btr46tjm/)**  

**Diverse Brewing Options**  
One thing that stood out was its ability to cater to various tastes. Whether you‚Äôre craving a shot of traditional espresso, an aromatic cup of Cuban coffee, or the bold flavors of Italian coffee, this machine‚Äôs versatility has got you covered. I first tested it with Moka coffee, and I was quite pleased! It delivers rich flavors and manages to enhance the coffee aromas. My roommate, who loves entertaining guests, often uses it to serve Cuban coffee after dinner parties‚Äîit‚Äôs always a hit.

**Highlights**  
- Detachable base adds convenience and portability.  
- Compact yet functional design suitable for apartments or offices.  
- Easy one-touch brewing system makes operation hassle-free.  

**Drawbacks**  
Although the machine checks many boxes, there are some areas lacking.  
- Aluminum material raises concerns about long-term durability.  
- Limited automated options compared to more advanced espresso makers.  

**Target Users and Portability**  
Given its compact 7.1 x 4.72 x 9.3-inch dimensions, this espresso maker is perfect for those with limited counter space. It‚Äôs an equally great companion for coffee lovers in dorms or small apartments. As someone who occasionally travels for work, I find it handy to pack for trips when I can't trust the hotel coffee. One of my coworkers even borrowed it for an office event and loved its easy portability for a pop-up coffee setup.  

**Product Comparisons**  
For my review, I compared this espresso maker to the Bialetti Moka Express and the De‚ÄôLonghi Dedica Espresso Machine. The Bialetti, while similar in its focus on brewing Cuban-style coffee, can't compete with the electric convenience of the Imusa machine. On the other hand, the De‚ÄôLonghi model shines with more automation and precise temperature settings but comes at a much steeper price. Budget-conscious espresso enthusiasts will find the Imusa product a better fit for their everyday needs.  

**Price Worthiness**  
When considering its price point, it delivers solid value. What it may lack in automation, it makes up through ease of use and functionality. It doesn‚Äôt rival the complexity of high-end espresso machines, but for the cost, you‚Äôre getting a reliable coffee companion capable of delivering multiple coffee styles. Users seeking a balance of performance and affordability will likely feel it‚Äôs well worth every penny.

The idea is simple: positioning it properly takes seconds, and then it‚Äôs just a matter of pouring water evenly over the coffee grounds. What I loved, especially on rushed mornings, is how the design eliminates the reliance on a gooseneck kettle. Water is distributed evenly through various-sized holes with just the right flow rate, ensuring no overpour disasters. Talk about coffee-making without the associated anxiety.

**Perfect for Consistent Brewing**  
I can‚Äôt stress how annoying it is when your morning cup tastes like dishwater some days and heaven on others. This tool tackles inconsistency head-on, making even-flow brewing its standout feature. The V60 dripper lets water pass into the central filter section in a precise and controlled manner. The thoughtfulness behind this small but crucial detail is a lifesaver for perfectionists or anyone serious about getting a coffeehouse-level brew at home.

**Strengths**  
- Super simple setup and functionality, even for beginners.  
- Eliminates the need for a gooseneck kettle, saving counter space and money.  
- Prevents overpouring with its smart design, perfect for consistent coffee results.  

**Potential Downsides**  
One drawback I noticed is its dependency on hot water being poured at just the right temperature. If you‚Äôre like me and occasionally wing it with heating water, you might not get the optimal taste. Additionally, while the tool itself is easy to use, the lack of included accessories (like filters or measuring tools) might feel limiting if you‚Äôre starting from scratch.

**Areas of Concern**  
- Requires carefully heated water to achieve the best flavor.  
- Doesn‚Äôt come with extras like filters or a scoop, which could be useful.  

**Materials and Durability**  
Made of clear plastic, it has a sleek and lightweight feel. Despite being light, it feels durable enough for everyday use. However, as with any manual tool in my kitchen arsenal, I know keeping it clean and free from mineral buildup is key to longevity. It performed like a champ in everyday scenarios over weeks of testing without showing wear.

**Competing Products**  
While evaluating this, I was tempted to revisit some peers in the market, such as the Chemex coffee maker and Kalita Wave drippers. Chemex leans heavily on aesthetic appeal but can seem overly fussy for an everyday user. On the other hand, Kalita‚Äôs flat bottom design ensures superb water distribution but lacks the Hario PDA-02-T‚Äôs simplicity and ability to integrate without needing multiple pieces. Ultimately, the Hario tool strikes a balance between function and convenience that‚Äôs hard to beat.

**True Value**  
When looking at its utility and comparing it to similar options, I‚Äôd confidently call this an affordable quality purchase. While it‚Äôs not a complete coffee-making kit, its niche lies in tackling common issues many coffee enthusiasts face. The money saved on skipping the gooseneck kettle already makes this feel like a financial win for me. For the price point, what it offers is straightforward yet impactful.

\*\*\*

I thought I could stay away. I've always vastly overestimated my own willpower.

\*\*\*

I made my mind up. Determined to leave the package on the front stoop. Maybe one of those people who steal packages from porches would take it. Relieve me of this burden.

So I curled up under my weighted blanket and slept. Dreams of Gen, as always. I can feel her gentle touch when I'm in that liminal space between awakeness and sleep. So real.

The banging  sounded like gunshots. Still in the haze of dream, I wondered if this was the end. If I could go gently into that good night.

Then it happened again, four sharp quick sounds punctuating the pre dawn. The door knocker.

Only one person in my life would knock like that. Arrogant, assuming, as if everyone's property belongs to him. The scorn of suburbia; the HOA president.

The door creaked open, lodging it's complaint for me.  Brendan stood there, Milly in his arms.

""We have leash laws."" He held Milly out. She wagged her tail. I almost kept quiet. What willpower?

""She was in the yard."" Internally he stiffened up. Not used to being challenged. He picked up the package and handed it to me.

""This has been here a week. That's an appearance violation, incurring a $500 charge. You'll see it on your next bill.""

He crossed his arms and walked off with an audible sigh.

I shut the door. Milly l looked at me.

His wife had always been very affectionate around me. At neighborhood parties, she would lean in a little too far during my stories. Laugh a little too loud. I'm not THAT funny.

I pulled up the youtube page. The video. Before I knew it, I had forwarded her the link. ""A project I'm working on. What do you think?""

I'd like to say I hesitated before I hit send. I didn't.

Later I was woken up by some commotion. I went to the door, where I could see Brendan's front door. He was stumbling out, just in his boxers.

Sarah was watching him from the doorframe, a mug in her hand.

I opened the door. Brendan stumbled closer. His eyes opaque, blood streaming from his nose. He reached my yard and fell down. Mouth foaming.

Realization set in that I had maybe done this. The blanket felt suffocating. Before I could at least claim ignorance. But this... was deliberate.

His eyes stared at me as his breath caught in his throat.

""She put it... in... my coffee."" His chest heaved one last time, then the life left his body.

I looked over at Sarah. She lifted the cup in my direction, then drained the contents with a grimace. Empty. She smiled at me, then walked to the end of the driveway and sat.

It hit me. She was sitting there, waiting to die in the same horrendous way she had just watched Brendan die.

I ran inside, head spinning, trying to catch my breath. Sat down on the edge of the bed. Looked over. Milly had gotten to the package, had torn it open. The pages spread across the floor.

As I picked them up, my eye caught the first image. Immediately I was hooked. I could see it in my mind. I shuffled through them, the images becoming clearer.

When it got to the last page, there was just a sentence written.

WATCH THE FILM

For a moment, I struggled to figure out what was being said. Then I realized I had never watched the first video. Yes, I had filmed it. Edited it. But I somehow just knew when each part was complete. Like the tumblers on a lock falling into place.

I had never watched it in it's entirety.

People had tried to remove it. Other people fought this, claiming freedom of speech. Claiming there's no reason why these images should provoke this reaction.

I knew, though. It activated our deepest, hidden impulses. The ones from our time in the jungles, when it was kill or be killed. The desires Stalin had as he sent his friends to the Gulag. The reason horror films thrill us.

That area that modern society has pushed down deep, for comfort and convenience.

And to make this next film, I'd need that part fully alive. Not buried beneath a blanket, hiding from life.

Looking at the monitor, I was an equal mix of apprehension and anticipation. A live wire, brimming with electricty.

I hesitated before pressing play.

That hunger still gnawed at me. Something in the deep recesses of my subconscious told me to stop. That this hunger would just grow and grow, never satiated.

But I never felt so alive.

I knew it wouldn't kill me. Somehow I knew the effect on me would be much, much worse. For the world, humanity in general. Assuming humanity as we know it survived this. 

My hand reached out, almost of it's own accord, and pressed the button.",2,1756321561.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

I was inspired by LC-DL, but didn't like the lack of available repos. Now you can add any\* AltStore/SideStore repo to this shortcut and install IPAs directly into LiveContainer!

The shortcut loads every app from a repo into a custom page (as pictured), where you are presented with an App ID to input in the next step. The app is then downloaded and extracted into your LiveContainer application folder.

\*App icons are downloaded once and then cached locally. For large repos, the first load can take a while, but once they are cached the loading is much faster. I think its worth the nice UI but I might add a quicker load option without images.

1n1pwxl,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1n1pwxl/aita_for_ruining_my_husbands_career_after_he/,"AITA for ruining my husband's career after he exposed my affair, then making his life hell with fake paternity claims?","Edit: [with ALL UPDATES](https://youtu.be/nTthDdpANQw)

My husband found out I was sleeping with his brother and decided to blow up my entire life at his company Christmas party. So I returned the favor and then some.

Here's what happened. I work in marketing and my husband works, well worked, at this tech startup that he absolutely loved. His boss always had a thing for me. Made it obvious at company events, always complimenting me, asking if I was happy. My husband never noticed because he's clueless about these things.

When my husband caught me with his brother, he didn't just confront me privately like a normal person. He waited until his company's annual BBQ and announced it to everyone. In front of his boss, his coworkers, everyone. He stood up during the speeches and said, ""I'd like to thank my wife for sleeping with my brother while I was working 60 hour weeks to build this company.""

The whole place went silent. I wanted to disappear. But his boss looked at me with this mix of pity and interest. My husband stormed off and I ended up crying to his boss about how unhappy I'd been, how my husband never paid attention to me.

Two weeks later, my husband got fired. ""Budget cuts."" His boss called me the same day.

""I'm sorry about what happened to your husband,"" he said. ""But maybe we could grab coffee sometime. You seemed like you could use a friend.""

I said yes. Within a month, I was his girlfriend. My husband was devastated. He kept calling, begging me to work things out. But I was done. His boss was taking me to nice restaurants, buying me jewelry. Everything my husband never did.

The real drama started when I showed up to the next company event as his boss's date. My husband was there as a vendor, trying to network his way back into the industry. His face went white when he saw me.

His mom was there too. She pulled me aside and called me trash.

""You destroyed my son's career,"" she hissed. ""He loved that job.""

I looked her right in the eye and said, ""Your son couldn't afford me anyway. Maybe he should have thought about that before humiliating me in public.""

She slapped me. Right there in front of everyone.

But here's where it gets complicated. I found out I was pregnant a month later. The thing is, the timing is weird. It could be my husband's, his brother's, or his boss's. I honestly don't know.

Instead of figuring it out, I decided to make my husband's life hell. I filed for child support, claiming the baby was his. He demanded a paternity test, obviously. But here's the thing, in our state, you can't force a paternity test until after the baby is born.

So for nine months, I had him paying temporary support while I lived with his boss. I'd send him pictures of my growing belly, saying things like ""your baby is doing great"" just to mess with his head.

When the baby was born, the paternity test came back. Not his. But by then I'd gotten almost a year of support payments and his credit was ruined from the legal fees.

He tried to sue me for fraud but his lawyer said it would be hard to prove I knew the baby wasn't his. His brother disappeared completely after the test results. Moved to another state. His boss dumped me when the drama got too much for the company.

Now I'm a single mom and my husband, well ex-husband, is working at a call center making minimum wage. His family won't talk to him because they think he drove me to cheat with his neglect. He lost his career, his family, and almost two years of his life.

My friends are split. Some say he deserved it for humiliating me publicly. Others think I went way too far with the fake paternity thing. His mom still sends me nasty texts calling me evil.

I'm not proud of everything I did, but he started this war when he decided to ruin my reputation instead of handling our problems privately.

1n1pwlh,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealTechTakes/comments/1n1pwlh/why_is_the_newmen_gm326_best_gaming_keyboard_for/,Why is the Newmen GM326 best gaming keyboard for compact setups,"Testing out the Newmen GM326 mechanical keyboard felt like rediscovering what a truly functional gaming accessory should be. Among the tangle of wires and gadgets that crowd my desk, this compact 75% keyboard immediately stood out‚Äînot only because of its sleek design but also the practicality it offers. After spending countless hours gaming, typing, and occasionally trying not to spill coffee on it, I have a clearer picture of its strengths and quirks.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that catches your eye is the clean and modern design of the keyboard. It's compact, taking up minimal desk space without feeling cramped during use. The mechanical keyboard‚Äôs white chassis, paired with rainbow LED backlighting, adds a dramatic visual element that‚Äôs not too over-the-top. It comes with six customizable lighting colors and 20 modes, which you can tweak for whatever mood or aesthetic you want. I particularly appreciated the detachable USB-C cable, which makes it a breeze to toss into a bag for work or quick setups during LAN parties. At 1.73 pounds, the build feels solid‚Äîno cheap plastic vibes here.

**Adjustable Features and Knob Functionality**  
One feature that genuinely surprised me was the multi-function knob in the corner of the keyboard. Turning it to adjust the volume felt natural and seamless, unlike some fiddly controls I‚Äôve used on other keyboards. Its placement means it‚Äôs always within easy reach but doesn‚Äôt crowd the other keys. Alongside this, the three indicator lights are a simple but clever touch, allowing me to immediately see if Caps Lock is on or whether I‚Äôm in Mac or Windows mode.

[Check Newmen GM326 deals on Amazon now.](https://preciseshop.com/p/b0cfl6mnqg/)

**Typing and Gaming Performance**  
This keyboard uses red linear switches, and I‚Äôm convinced it‚Äôs why typing on it feels so responsive. There‚Äôs minimal sound‚Äîa bit subdued compared to the clackier alternatives‚Äîbut that softer feedback makes it ideal for shared spaces or late-night gaming sessions without disrupting everyone else in the house. It‚Äôs not just a gaming keyboard; extended typing tasks, like writing this review, were enjoyable because of the smooth keystrokes. 

For gaming, the anti-ghosting feature was a lifesaver, especially in fast-paced scenarios. I could hammer multiple keys simultaneously without any lag or confused inputs, making it perfect for competitive games that demand precision. It's compatible with PC, Mac, and a range of operating systems, so swapping between my setup and my partner‚Äôs MacBook was extremely hassle-free.

**Ergonomics and Comfort**  
This keyboard ticks the ergonomic box surprisingly well. The two-stage adjustable tilt legs were a thoughtful touch. Depending on whether I was gaming or typing, I could pick between two heights to ensure a comfortable wrist angle. The stepped ABS keycaps also contributed to ease of use, as my fingers didn‚Äôt feel fatigued even after long hours of work or play. However, I did notice that the keyboard doesn‚Äôt come with a wrist rest, which might be an issue for some users who prefer additional support.

**Positives**  
- The compact 75% layout saves space without compromising functionality.  
- Hot-swappable keys allow for easy customization with different layouts or switches.  
- Excellent RGB lighting options and modes for personalizing the experience.  
- Responsive red switches lend themselves to gaming and day-to-day typing.  

**Critiques**  
- The lack of included wrist support could make extended use uncomfortable for some.  
- The rainbow backlight isn‚Äôt individually programmable, reducing its appeal for advanced users.  
- ABS keycaps are decent but don‚Äôt feel as premium as some PBT alternatives.  

**Product Comparisons**  
Compared to other mechanical keyboards in its price range, the Newmen GM326 has some interesting competition. A popular rival would be the Razer Huntsman Mini, which offers optical key switches and individually programmable RGB lighting, but it‚Äôs often pricier. The GM326 holds its ground by including hot-swappable functionality, something the Huntsman Mini doesn‚Äôt offer. For those wanting better keycap materials, the Keychron K6 is a strong contender with PBT keycaps and wireless functionality, though ganging up features like that usually inflates the cost. What makes the GM326 stand out is how well it balances affordability and performance across typing, gaming, and portability.

**Price Performance**  
Considering the features and performance, this keyboard offers excellent bang for the buck, especially for casual users or gamers who want reliability without breaking the bank. While premium keyboards in the market cost significantly more, this wired option hits a sweet spot between build quality, features, and affordability. If hot-swappable keys and customizable lighting setups are must-haves, the added value of these perks reinforces its appeal.

This is a **terrible business decision.** It‚Äôs basically handing a gift-wrapped talking point to competitors like OpenAI and xAI. Why make it easier for them to lure away your best users?

Please rethink this. Many of us are here because Claude *was* the tool we trusted for serious work. This change undercuts that completely.

1n1puwi,https://www.reddit.com/r/UMBC/comments/1n1puwi/fdoc_diarrhea/,FDOC diarrhea,"Hello, I‚Äôm a new student and, for whatever reason, I have come to Reddit to lighten my load.

Today was my first day of university. I was excited. I chose UMBC, love the small community, nerd atmosphere, perfect. I had my first day of school fit on today; I even got some compliments. I woke up today at 9 a.m. for physics. I commute from an off-campus apartment, so I was like, feeling like a real college student, you know. I made my coffee, at first black, but that‚Äôs disgusting. I added a shit load of sugar, made it larger, and a bunch of syrup. It was great.

I‚Äôm not a usual coffee consumer and I had shit during physics, to get right to it. Another class later, I decided, okay, I‚Äôll just come late to that lecture, but it wanted to release. So I go to the Meyerhoff bathroom, and how‚Äôs it already nasty, I wondered.

I go to the rec for single bathrooms, as I remember from the tour, and luckily it was open. Well‚Ä¶ it was explosive, splattered around the bowl, it stunk. I wiped and, on exit, I see a girl and what probably was her boyfriend waiting outside. I make solid eye contact, my outfit roughed up like I‚Äôd just been in a fight. And she enters as I‚Äôm leaving, and she coughs, gags, leaves the bathroom. I can hear it as I walk away, and her boyfriend or friend starts hysterically laughing, both of them.

I‚ÄôM A LOSER üòîüòî

And today in the library I briefly saw them in the library imma order a noose because they had a bunch of friends too and maintained eye contact with me.

Anyways make light of the situation and make it funny so it‚Äôs just a funny situation not end of life shit.",16,1756321167.0,UMBC,5,0.9,False

I always get up when i waken and write down EVERYTHING i remember there and then.  My husband has been in a few dreams since he passed but this seemed to go on all night and was so clear and defined. I hope it helps someone.



J was¬†in my dream last night. A long one and full of a lot of imagery and his words.

J looked like he did about 6 years ago. He looked rested and healthy. He was determined to show me something.

We had gone to an old post office/bank/admin office that we used to go to somewhere from our past together. It was dark and gloomy, and there was a big queue. J as usual, was patient and I was looking around at the stationery and people. We were just happily in our own company and contented as we were.¬† When we reached the clerk she said,‚Äô Oh nice to see you. You‚Äôve not been here for a while. Why are you back?‚Äô And J said‚Ä¶‚Äô we are going to have a home together in that place, which is down the road, but it isn‚Äôt ready for us both just yet. We just wanted to check on it and see how it was coming along, and have a plan for what to do meanwhile. ‚Äò

The clerk said‚Ä¶.‚Äôoh we know about that place, but most can‚Äôt see it yet. And some don‚Äôt believe it is actually there. I hope you have a nice wander and get the answers you need.‚Äô

So, we went out onto the street, and it was gloomy, damp, and foggy. But we could see the entrance to some sort of shopping /entertainment complex ahead, and J said that‚Äôs where we should go. We could both see a kind of tower of light rising from the centre of the structure, and that‚Äôs where our place/home was meant to be when it was ready.

As we entered the centre, it started in black and white, but we could see colour ahead. There¬†looked to be amazing things to explore, but there was a kind of public seat, and J sat down on it. I said‚Ä¶‚Äôcome on,.let‚Äôs go see what we can find,‚Äô

J¬† said, ‚ÄòI can‚Äôt go in there with you sweetheart, but I can wait on this seat and watch you and be here when you have finished enjoying what is there. ‚Äò

I felt a bit sad, but he said‚Ä¶‚Äô wait to you see what is there. You will love it! Off you go!‚Äô

So, I cuddled him and stepped into the place, and it got lighter with every step I took. I looked back, and J was still on the bench.

Then I was just in awe at this place. It was like the brightest, shiny world and was full of happiness and fun. It was like a big road, but I was aware it was like a curve . I knew that at one point I would lose sight of J, but trusted he said he would be watching and there when I got back.

First, there was an Italian ice cream shop, and I stopped and ordered an ice cream and then looked in the shop windows while I ate it. Next was like a 5 or 6 very lovely boutiques displaying all different styles of clothes . There were no tills /cash registers for money or credit cards. I thought the shops would be expensive because they had no price tags, but they were all just free.

Then there were a few Baby and Kids' clothes shops and toy shops, and I enjoyed picking out things for our grandchildren and friends‚Äô kids. There were balloons, toys, and sweets.

¬†As I walked more towards the curve of the building, I looked back, and J was still sitting on the bench, smiling.

¬†At the bottom of the curve, there was what looked like an amazing old Italian hotel with full floor-to-ceiling glass windows. The entry floor had loads of tables and was some sort of coffee shop/ bistro. I saw a woman my age with her daughters and another with daughters and sons, and grandchildren having a celebration. There was a woman on her own, reading a book while enjoying her coffee and cake. 4 women were laughing together with coffee and fizzy wine. Every combination of friendship/families, acquaintances, and strangers enjoying the place. I didn‚Äôt go in but stayed watching for quite a while.¬† I walked along the frontage and then realised that J was out of my sight now. I was shaky and tearful but thought, 'I want to see what else is here and he will be waiting'. So, I followed the Up curve of the place and there were more things...a dance studio, a pet groomer, horses, trampolines, an art shop, a huge music shop and a portal to Venice!

I walked and enjoyed. There is so much that I can‚Äôt remember, but I know they were things I enjoy or admire.

Then I panicked as the place was becoming another curve and I thought‚Äô oh...where do I go‚Äô and I realised then that it was a circle and if I just didn‚Äôt go back the way and kept going I would go right back to J. So, I relaxed, saw more things and as I got more tired I¬† saw J on the bench, and he smiled and looked pleased. I sat beside him and said that this place was amazing, but these moments were sad without you, but it was still an amazing and enjoyable place to visit.

Then J said‚Ä¶‚Äô you can visit this place every day ‚Ä¶day after day, year after year, and every time you go round I will be here waiting on you...until the place we will both be together is ready for us both. I will wait here for you until it is, and won‚Äôt go to our new place without you. This is your time and place to enjoy and thrive until our place together is ready. So enjoy the days in all these places and family and friends, and I will watch over you all and be here when you need to check in or need me.‚Äô

I remember being happy knowing he would be waiting for me and was asking me to go explore and have fun, and have adventures. Then I woke up and cried for quite a while.

I feel J was telling me in the dream that there was a life here for me to move forward with, while reassuring me that we would be together again when the time was right. It was lovely seeing J healthy again without the cancer, but it was also very sad to realise I was without him again and my grief was intense and ugly for days after. Yet, I am so glad I had this dream. Thank you for reading this. Maybe someone needs to hear it.",21,1756321045.0,Dreams,3,1.0,False

This case had an RFE in the middle of May 2024, and I sent all documents related to the RFE that I had at the time on May 30th 2024.

This RFE was related to an arrest. Long story short, while working in retail, a habitual criminal hoodrat attacked me by way of throwing a cup of coffee at my face, a bundle of firewood at me, as well as other various things. My reaction to this attack was to grab a bat and go outside, smashing two windows of the car he got into. I don't regret this, and never will.

The cops who showed up at this scene made the brilliant decision to arrest me while letting the habitual criminal go. The same habitual criminal who instigated everything and escalated things to the physical level in the first place. The cop who wrote the police report flagrantly lied, stating what I did was a reaction to a verbal dispute. Note that the cops were shown surveillance footage of this conflict. This was not just a matter of believing one's word over another. I'm not sure what language the habitual criminal was speaking when he threw a cup of coffee at my face, but so it goes. In the end though, after 4 court hearings, the case against me was dismissed. At the time of the last court hearing, the habitual criminal was serving a 1 year sentence in Cook County jail for another offense (to the surprise of absolutely no one).

All's well that ends well, although you know never know with this administration.

So in 2024 specifically on 17th January i got into an accident stupid one my mistake I must say I was alone on the road alone 

When I got stitches almost no anaesthesia was used so it hurted like hell got 9 or 10 stitches on scalp

The shaking started by that time I think so 

After that I lost my weight due to accident and all from 93kg to 66kg (current) 

So the shakiness whenever I smoke or do any random small thing my hands shake 

I can't even hold a small papercup filled with coffee or tea why cuz my hands shake so bad i might spill it on me 

When I go out with friends before accident i used to drink tea or coffee no cigs back then (i started smoking in 2025) 

Now when I go out with hem I order nothing because the shakiness is so bad i can't even enjoy my cup of tea or coffee 

The shakiness is so bad i sometimes can't even put my ciggerate in my mouth due to the tremors 

The shaking is so bad at that times my whole body shakes and idk what to do so I just put the cig aside for a minute 

Around 2024 december I was handing my question paper to a girl and she saw my hands trembling and asked are ya freezing I took the advantage of weather and said yea 


But in general it was my shaking due to no shit 

I don't think what other would think or that 

I hate the shaking because I can't even do smallest shit on my own like having a coffee or handing a paper 

Due to all this I'm thinking ofextreme measures for my fingers  like ‚úÇÔ∏è or ‚õìÔ∏è‚Äçüí• them


The weight loss, it was so sudden almost none of my old friends recognise me fast cuz of it, it feels good but it doesn't help me in anyway 

Back then in 2024 I wanted to get a girl but I was fat af now I'm slim in muscular build I still can't get a girl so that's that 


Now that girl I mentioned earlier started talking to me only after that interaction maybe she felt pity or something and I dont want anyone to feel pity for me 

The girl part ain't that main the main thing is the tremors

Thanks for reading it to this far

I know that remaining 10% is probably a huge deal for a lot of people, and I might get a lot of hate for saying this but for me it just doesn't seem worth it and MAYBE it's subjective BS, or at least subjective conjecture.

When I was beginning my home espresso journey, browsing through this subreddit was like reading a different language. The amount of extra things you can do or buy is limitless, the opinions were limitless... This got to a point to where I almost forsook the whole idea of getting a machine. It was really hard to tell where the line between reasonable advice and unreasonable advice was. 

I recently watched a pretty entertaining YouTube vid wherein Matt D'Avella competed against Jack Simpson trying to see who can make the best drinks. The thing that kind of annoyed me was that he used his home equipment while Jack used professional grade equipment. Also the judges were not blinded to who made which drinks. They were all fawning over the professionals espresso drink... some of their critiques were valid like "" this drink is too cold "", but otherwise the way they rated the coffees were very subjective. It would have been a lot more interesting with a blinded trial because I feel like our perceptions play into how good we think a drink is. 

When you go out to buy a drink at a cafe, you don't put forth any effort except for that effort which you expended on getting the money to pay for your drink, so that can skew your perception of how good a drink is. The environment is different, sometimes you're with friends, sometimes you have past memories there, sometimes it's a new place. I just think that there are a lot more that play into getting good espresso than we think and that's actually the 10% that people are constantly trying to replicate.

Personally I would like to thank people on this thread, because it saved me a great deal of trial and error on my own, but at the same time.. I don't know, I feel like there's a lot of bullshitting going on.

1n1phrf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassroomOfTheElite/comments/1n1phrf/y3v2_analysis_who_are_the_shirogane_spies/,Y3V2 Analysis: Who are the Shirogane spies?,"Now that Y3V2 is fully out, I can post this analysis without spoiling anyone on too much.

TLDR:

Shiraishi

Amikura

Hiyori (least likely to be true)

Koenji

Why do I believe there are 4:

We know Shiraishi has one more ally. Nanase also suspects there are more spies. Logically there's no reason to place a spy in Arisu's class and not in Koji's class, and there's also the issue of class transfers.

Therefore, we can safely assume they accounted for the possibility Ayanokoji would transfer classes, and since they can't predict which class he will transfer to (if he does at all) they placed 1 spy per class (or more)

And now for the actual analysis;

Shiraishi - 

Confirmed, no reason for analysis. Read her SS.

Amikura -

Let's traceback the timeline.

Shiraishi told Nanase ""Ayanokoji is at the gym with Ichinose and won't be out for at least one hour""

Ayanokoji met with the following people that day on his way to the gym:

Watanabe, Utomiya, Akiyama (gym staff), Ichinose, Amikura.

Ayanokoji also noted the gym is relatively empty.

Let's try to narrow down the spy from this list, working under the assumption Kinu allows us to figure out who it is.

If Watanabe, Utomiya, or Akiyama were the spies, we'd expect a report like ""Ayanokoji is at the gym"" the specification of Ichinose is not something they can add because they saw him before Ichinose arrived, and I can't imagine a reason for them to contact Shiraishi again to specifically add that he is with Ichinose - and even if they did, it would've been like ""Ayanokoji arrived at the gym and was joined by Ichinose-san"", but instead, it was ""Ayanokouji-kun just entered the gym with Ichinose-san""

So we can eliminate Watanabe, Utomiya, and Akiyama. Leaving us with Amikura and Ichinose. Since Ichinose isn't from Shirogane's facility, the only person we're left with is Amikura.

*Â§ñ„Å´Âá∫„ÅüÁõ¥Âæå„Å´„Åù„ÅÜÂàá„ÇäÂá∫„Åó„ÅüÁ∂≤ÂÄâ„ÅØ„ÄÅ„Éë„ÉÉ„Å®‰ø∫„Åü„Å°„Åã„ÇâË∑ùÈõ¢„ÇíÂèñ„Çã„Çà„ÅÜ„Å´Ë∂≥„ÇíÂâç„Å´ÈÄ≤„ÇÅ„Çã„Å®Êâã„ÇíÊåØ„Å£„Å¶„Ç®„Çπ„Ç´„É¨„Éº„Çø„Éº„Çí‰∏ã„Å£„Å¶„ÅÑ„Å£„Åü„ÄÇ*

*(Immediately after we got outside, Amikura spoke up, and as if to put distance between us, she moved ahead, waved, and went down the escalator.)*

she also quickly separated herself from the group, probably to send an update report to Shiraishi.

Koenji -

He is a student with amazing abilities, special, and can be called a genius without hesitation. This fits the general idea I believe the Kijima facility has - instead of doing what the WR does (attempting to take the ordinary and turn them into geniuses) they are trying to take the gifted/geniuses and make them even stronger. We know Shiraishi, a confirmed Shirogane student, has special, unique talents. She is able to tell lies and truths from voices alone, and is so accurate to a point not seeing your face makes it easier for her to detect whether or not you're telling the truth, since while you can mislead her with facial expressions you can't do so with your voice.

We also know Koenji prefers not being in ANHS but ""something"" forced him to be in ANHS.

(Y2V11) -

*""Personally, I would find it more worthwhile to visit China once again to devote myself to training, rather than attend this school. There are circumstances that have prevented me from doing so.‚Äù*

We also know for a fact the thing he was supposed to do in the school is not to get to Class A, otherwise, his dad's recent orders (graduate from A for freedom) which were new orders wouldn't make sense, would they?

He also, generally speaking, paid a lot of attention to Ayanokoji since their enrollment. He noticed he's the one who took down Ryuen, for example. Considering his dad is Kijima's biggest backer, and Shirogane is most likely Kijima's employee, he is a pretty safe bet.

Hiyori -

Last but not least, and the hardest case to make. Honestly, I can't really think of anyone else from Ryuen's class, so we go with this. Let's break it down:

First I will approach things from a more meta-perspective. Remember that Koenji statement about having to be in ANHS? Well, Ayanokoji ignored it, because Ayanokoji ignores meta-revealing secrets. He can't spoil the readers. In this volume, Shiraishi said Ayanokoji has a ""good taste"" for picking Hiyori, and asked him to ""Say hi for her/send her regards"" to Shiina.

Ayanokoji ignored her second statement, asking to send regards to Shiina, despite them never having any interactions on screen before.

Also regarding the first statement she made:

*""...setting your sights on Shiina-san... I'd say you have excellent taste. I think it shows a wonderful eye for beauty!""*

I could see Shiraishi's eyes sparkle as she watched Hiyori walk away. It brought back memories of my recent conversation with Shimazaki and Yoshida

So this raises the possibility Hiyori is a ""school friend"" of Shiraishi.

Also, in Y1V6, Hiyori's introduction is slightly odd. Basically, she remade the coffee for Haruka and put in the exact amount of sugar. When asked how, she said she calculated the amount of sugar based on the spilled coffee. This was a lie, the truth is she just watched Haruka adding X sugar packs and added the same amount, which is a bit OOC for the girl Hiyori ended up becoming.

I am aware this is pretty weak reasoning, there are good arguments for why Hiyori can't be the school friend/spy, but I think she's the best bet out of Ryuen's class.

This concludes my analysis. For now, these are my guesses.",12,1756320334.0,ClassroomOfTheElite,6,0.93,False

When I got stitches almost no anaesthesia was used so it hurted like hell got 9 or 10 stitches on scalp

The shaking started by that time I think so 

After that I lost my weight due to accident and all from 93kg to 66kg (current) 

So the shakiness whenever I smoke or do any random small thing my hands shake 

I can't even hold a small papercup filled with coffee or tea why cuz my hands shake so bad i might spill it on me 

When I go out with friends before accident i used to drink tea or coffee no cigs back then (i started smoking in 2025) 

Now when I go out with hem I order nothing because the shakiness is so bad i can't even enjoy my cup of tea or coffee 

I shake so bad i can't even put the cig in my mouth sometimes and this happens so bad i can't even control my body for some time 

Around 2024 december I was handing my question paper to a girl and she saw my hands trembling and asked are ya freezing I took the advantage of weather and said yea 


But in general it was my shaking due to no shit 

I don't think what other would think or that 

I hate the shaking because I can't even do smallest shit on my own like having a coffee or handing a paper 

Due to all this I'm thinking ofextreme measures for my fingers  like ‚úÇÔ∏è or ‚õìÔ∏è‚Äçüí• them


The weight loss it was so sudden almost none of my old friends recognise me fast cuz of it, it feels good but it doesn't help me in anyway 

Back then in 2024 I wanted to get a girl but I was fat af now I'm slim in muscular build I still can't get a girl so that's that 


Now that girl I mentioned earlier started talking to me only after that interaction maybe she felt pity or something and I dont want anyone to feel pity for me


I'm really alone ngl I talked to chat gpt on this and guess what it said *you've reached the limit talk again 20 hours later*

So I guess I need someone to talk to 

Anyways thanks for staying with me till now I hope you enjoy your cigs, coffee or tea peacefully ",5,1756320241.0,sadposting,4,1.0,False

i have friends that religiously brush three times a day, floss, go to the dentist for cleanings, and they still have/had multiple cavities. a lot of my friends like that are also pretty healthy and avoid sugar, all forms of caffeine, don‚Äôt smoke, so i don‚Äôt understand how i‚Äôve never had a cavity, and my teeth aren‚Äôt egregiously yellow. i feel like they really should be absolutely wrecked from what i hear of other peoples experiences. 

my teeth aren‚Äôt pearly white ofc, but they‚Äôre the same ivory color as most of the rest of the population, and i‚Äôm inclined to assume most people probably do the recommended brushing twice a day, but mine have been through the absolute ringer. 

am i just lucky? is it genetic? i feel like from everyone else‚Äôs experience, teeth seem insanely easy to mess up pretty good. i have a friend who didn‚Äôt brush for 6 months during a depressive episode and she completely lost about half of them, and the ones she has left have a lot of black on them and are missing big chunks. i feel like ive actually treated mine worse, so mine should be similar and they‚Äôre not at all. 

and before people get on me too bad, i am trying to work on my self care in general. i know if i keep my habits up it‚Äôll catch up to me. brushed my teeth this morning and also flossed for the first time since i was a child. i‚Äôm also sorry if this comes off as rude, it‚Äôs not my intention at all, i‚Äôm just genuinely confused.

1n1pepz,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Business_Refuse_9579/comments/1n1pepz/smart_snack_swaps_lowercalorie_alternatives_to/,Smart Snack Swaps: Lower-Calorie Alternatives to Common Snacks,"Snacking is a part of daily life. The challenge is that most popular snacks are loaded with sugar, salt, or unhealthy fats. Small swaps can save hundreds of calories each day without leaving you hungry. Below are practical replacements for common snacks that cut calories and boost nutrition.

# 1. Potato Chips ‚Üí Air-Popped Popcorn

Potato chips can pack 150 calories in just one small handful. Air-popped popcorn offers crunch with far fewer calories. Three cups of plain popcorn average around 100 calories. Add a light sprinkle of spices instead of butter for more flavor without excess fat.

# 2. Candy Bars ‚Üí Dark Chocolate Squares

A standard candy bar often exceeds 250 calories and contains high sugar. Two small squares of 70% dark chocolate come in under 120 calories. You still get sweetness but with antioxidants and less added sugar.

# 3. Ice Cream ‚Üí Frozen Greek Yogurt

One cup of ice cream averages 270 calories or more. A cup of frozen Greek yogurt cuts that closer to 150 calories while also giving protein. Choose plain or lightly sweetened options to avoid hidden sugar.

# 4. Sugary Drinks ‚Üí Flavored Sparkling Water

Soda and sweetened iced teas add unnecessary calories. A single can of soda holds around 140 calories with no real nutrition. Flavored sparkling water provides taste with zero calories. It‚Äôs also hydrating and easy to find.

# 5. Cookies ‚Üí Apple Slices with Peanut Butter

Two large cookies can equal 200‚Äì250 calories. Swap them for apple slices with one teaspoon of peanut butter. This alternative keeps calories near 150 but adds fiber and healthy fats.

# 6. Granola Bars ‚Üí Nuts in Controlled Portions

Granola bars may look healthy but often hide 180‚Äì220 calories with sugar syrup. A small portion of nuts (about 12 almonds) contains 80‚Äì100 calories. Nuts bring lasting energy from protein and good fats when eaten in small servings.

# Using Nutrition Tools to Guide Smart Choices

When comparing snacks, nutrition calculators help estimate calories and macronutrients quickly. For example, the [Chipotle Nutrition Calculator](https://chipotlenutritioncalculator.online/) shows how extra toppings can double calorie counts. Similarly, the [Dunkin Nutrition Calculator](https://dunkinnutritioncalculator.online/) reveals how small adjustments, like skipping cream or sugar in coffee, save calories. Tools like these give clarity when building healthier routines.

For more food comparisons and healthy swaps, resources like [Get Recipe Guide](https://www.getrecipeguide.com/) provide breakdowns of popular meals and alternatives. These references make it easier to stick with lower-calorie choices that still taste satisfying.

# Final Thoughts

Snack swaps don‚Äôt need to feel restrictive. A few changes in daily habits can cut calorie intake without cutting enjoyment. Start small, track your progress, and rely on nutrition tools for accuracy. These choices add up, supporting long-term health and better energy.",1,1756320136.0,u_Business_Refuse_9579,0,1.0,False

I recently moved from Montreal and have been trying to put myself out there more lately, meeting new people, so I thought I‚Äôd give this a shot too! 

I enjoy cycling, walking, train rides, skydiving, concerts, raves and recently started climbing ( last week,   struggle with techniques but comfortable with v10)  
  
I have peculiar role of articulation in technology company. (nothing fancy (used to work in Luxury Fashion) but very second nature to me) I love it and it pays the bills.   
  
I love meaningful conversations and getting to know people. I can't keep up with a whole lot of people via chats and stuff, outside a personal setting as I am mostly away from phone.

I've been an early riser for years, so I don‚Äôt usually stay out super late ‚Äî but I‚Äôm¬†**definitely down to check out day raves**¬†or earlier meetups.

TL;DR: Spent a month testing every AI model for work, a few tools I'm building and RL. Build task-specific evals. Most are overhyped, a few are gems, model moats are ephemeral, and routers/gateways are the real game-changer.

So I've been building a few evaluation tools, RHLF and RL environments for the past few months so I decided to be extra and test literally everything.

100 models. 30 days. Too much coffee :( Here's what I found:  
  
1. Model moats are ephemeral

Model moats don't last and it can be hard to pay for many subscriptions if you're building for users and machines. What's SOTA today gets beaten in 2 months. Solution: Use platforms like Groq, OpenRouter, FAL, Replicate etc

My system now routes based on task complexity: Code generation, Creativity, Complex reasoning and Code generation.

2. Open source FTW

The gap is closing FAST. Scratch that. The gap between open and closed models has basically disappeared. If you're not evaluating open-source options, you're missing 80% of viable choices. From Deepseek, Qwen to Kimi, these models help you build quick MVPs at little or no cost. If you do care about privacy, Ollama and LMStudio are really good for local deployment.

3.Benchmarks are mostly decieving due to reward hacking

Benchmaxxing is a thing now. Models are increasingly being trained on popular eval sets, and it's actually annoying when models that scored ""high"" but sucked in practice. It's also why I'm a huge fan of human preference evaluation platforms that are not easily gamed (real world vs benchmarks). Build your own task-specific evals.

4.Inference speed is everything

Speed matters more than you think. Users don't care if your model is 2% more accurate if it takes 30 seconds to respond. Optimize for user experience, not just accuracy. Which leads me to..

5.Task-specific models > general purpose models for specialized work.

No 4 is also a huge reason why I'm a huge fan of small models finetuned for special tasks. Model size doesn't predict performance.

Test small models first etc Llama 3.2 1B, smolLLM, moondream etc and see if you can get a huge boost by finetuning them on domain tasks rather than just deploying a big SoTA general purpose model. Cost way lesser and usually faster.

Psalm 19:9-11 ""Reverence for the Lord is pure, lasting forever. The laws of the Lord are true; each one is fair.They are more desirable than gold, even the finest gold. They are sweeter than honey, even honey dripping from the comb. They are a warning to your servant, a great reward for those who obey them.""


Praise be to you, Father, for leading me to that church in Springfield where I received this Psalms study guide.  The guide explains, in the context of its time, how vital your word is and that those who are wise will cherish it above all else. In doing so, they will be rewarded with inner peace and satisfaction far beyond what anything else can offer, as well as the great treasure awaiting in heaven for all who abide by your commands.

The remarkable thing is that as I was reading this, I found myself in an affluent coffee shop in Bentonville, Arkansas. As I prepared to read, I looked around, observing and listening to everyone engaged in ""important"" business conversations and Skype meetings. Immediately, I began to feel inferior. ""You have wasted your life,"" the enemy whispered as I stared anxiously at my ""magical"" books. All around me, people chattered about
""profits and margins,,""growth and sustainability."" These ideas were spoken with a level of dedication and urgency that, at first glance, made each conversation in the coffee shop seem like a matter of life and death.

Each individual carried the pride of their various degrees and accolades in every word they spoke. Ideas go head-to-head as they fight to exalt themselves, one over the other. Some of these people had spent the majority of their adult lives in prestigious schools, solely to be qualified enough to participate in these exclusive coffeehouse conversations. I looked down at my ""magical"" books, and the serpent spoke again: ""You don't belong here,"" he declared. 

I spoke the name of Jesus over the lie and began to open your word. Immediately, there you were, Father. ""AWAY FROM MY SON!"" you shouted, reminding me of all you have taught me. ""A warning to your servant, a great reward to those who obey them."" Instantly, a moment of sobriety washed over me. The voices speaking of profits and margins blended into a Charlie Brown-like nonsense. Scriptures flooded my mind: Matthew 6:19-21, James 4:14, Corinthians 7:31, but you spoke to my heart through 1 John 2:17: ""And this world is fading away, along with everything that people crave, but anyone who does the will of God will live forever.""


In that moment, I imagined a Thanos-style ""snap"" as all the people, conversations, and even the coffee shop itself turned to dust. In a single instant, all that remained was me and my ""magical"" book. Over a hundred years of combined education filled the room, spread across countless conversations, yet in the twinkling of your eye, the only words that endured were those spoken to the college dropout in the corner of the room, clinging self-consciously to his 2,000-year-old ""magical"" book. I returned to reality, and my confidence was immediately restored. Jehovah, you are my ""margins,"" and Jesus is my ""profit."" The Kingdom of Heaven is hiring, and suddenly, I'm the most qualified candidate in the room.

She was always finding new guys to chat with, hang out with, and from the outside, it looked like I had been pushed completely to the side. Eight months of being connected with her felt like they had just turned to ashes. But I was so wrong. Women don‚Äôt just erase beautiful memories and experiences that easily. It‚Äôs almost impossible for someone who truly loved you to ‚Äújust move on‚Äù overnight. Even when she did everything she could to show me I should forget her, that she wasn‚Äôt the girl for me, it wasn‚Äôt as simple as it seemed.  After maybe a month of no contact, I deleted everything. I wanted to cut it all off. But one day, I grabbed a coffee with a friend who was still on good terms with her. In confidence, he told me that almost every time they talked, she asked about me, where I was, and what I was doing. Since I wasn‚Äôt on social media, she had no way of knowing. Hearing that honestly felt like a relief. She hadn‚Äôt completely erased me.

But at the same time, it pushed me to step even further away. Psychology is strange like that. During those nights, I would write down my hardest struggles, my thoughts, my daily battles before going to bed. Looking back at those notes, I realized one thing for sure: they don‚Äôt forget us that easily, no matter what happened. Of course, not every situation is the same, but in most cases, that connection lingers. In my case, sometimes she would act cold, but just a few days later she would come back sweet, almost begging for attention again. 

So yes, there‚Äôs always a chance she might come back. The real question is: is it worth it?

This product claims to improve water quality by reducing contaminants while preserving beneficial minerals. It's specifically tailored for the Waterdrop Under-Sink Ultra Filtration System (WD-TSU-B/WD-TSU-W) and the Integrated DC Filtration System (WD-TSC-W/WD-TSC-B). My journey with it involved daily use, scrutinizing its performance, ease of installation, and functionality. It's about time to dive into the nitty-gritty.

**Installation Experience**  
Setting this unit up was surprisingly simple‚Äîalmost too simple! It took me less than five minutes to complete. There‚Äôs no need for advanced plumbing skills or extra tools; I literally twisted the old one out and twisted this replacement in. My brother watched and joked about how even he, with his self-proclaimed ‚Äúanti-DIY‚Äù skills, could do it without frustration. For families or individuals looking for zero-hassle solutions, this feature is definitely a major win.  

[See Waterdrop WD-TSPP price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b0cn974rm9/)

**Performance and Filtration**  
The advanced PP membrane of this under sink sediment filter impressed me. It tackles sand, rust, particulates, and other fine impurities. Every time I filled a glass of water, it felt as though I had my personal bottled water supply under my sink. The water clarity? Stellar. I even used it in soups and coffee to taste-test the difference. My partner claimed it made her tea ‚Äúnoticeably smoother.‚Äù If reducing contaminants while retaining essential minerals matters to you (and it should!), then this filter knows its job well. However, don't expect it to handle heavy metals or more complex pollutants‚Äîthat's not its forte.

**Durability and Lifespan**  
The six-month service life is fair for most users, though in high-usage households, I suspect it might reach its limit sooner. With my family of five, it worked perfectly during our trial period, and I foresee it comfortably lasting the suggested time under normal use. If you can remember to swap it on time (set a calendar reminder, trust me, it helps), you‚Äôll enjoy consistent, safe filtration.

**Benefits**  
Its positives go beyond just its filtration capabilities. Here‚Äôs what stood out to me:  
- Well-designed for compatibility with multiple systems.  
- Quick installation process; ideal for those who hate complex setups.  
- Advanced PP material ensures effective reduction of sediment and particles.  
- Compact and lightweight at only 1.39 pounds‚Äîit doesn‚Äôt hog cabinet space!  

**Drawbacks**  
No product is without its flaws, and this one has some areas for improvement worth mentioning:  
- It doesn‚Äôt filter heavy metals, which limits it if your water supply has that issue.  
- For larger families, the six-month lifespan might seem too short.  
- Replacement cycle notifications would be a great feature, but they‚Äôre absent here.  

**Peer Products**  
Compared to popular competitors like iSpring and Culligan models, this filter occupies middle ground. The ease of installation here trumps the slightly bulkier and more time-consuming installation process of the iSpring filter series. And though Culligan offers excellent contaminant reduction, their filters might lack the easy maintenance and convenience level of the Waterdrop brand. However, those focused specifically on high-end filtration for lead may prefer filtering systems with stronger multi-stage processes. For everyday use, though, this device strikes a nice balance of practicality and effectiveness.

**Cost Efficiency**  
Considering its sleek features, the Waterdrop WD-TSPP provides good value for money. Sure, premium filter systems exist, but they often come with higher maintenance costs and steeper installation procedures. This product isn't just functional; it's cost-effective. It‚Äôs ideal for those who want better water without diving deep into their wallets. Still, regular replacements might feel like an added expense to budget-friendly minds.

Since the scene is small - more or less all the senior people know each other or off each other. I was contacted by a head hunter about a role but declined even though the job was actually interesting to me, because I had just been a year in my current place and felt it was too soon. After a month or so the ceo of the hiring company reached out directly - as mentioned it‚Äôs a small industry and quite informal so that‚Äôs normal. But at the same time my company was being bought up, so I was actually more keen to move and said yes to be included this time. CEO set up a coffee, and it was a very good chat. He asked if I wanted to be included in the process and I said yes, he than said the head hunter would  
Contact me to set it up. 

He did and I had a more formal interview with the CEO and another director that would be my closest colleague. It was a very good meeting, and I‚Äôm quite drilled. I know they were pretty much set on me because When the meeting was over the head hunter said they‚Äôd make a decision the following week and said if I had any questions I could just contact him and then the CEO said - or just call me and we‚Äôll have a coffee and chat about it. He also gave a lot of other clues. I mean why would he want to have coffee with me after all the interviews were y if I wasn‚Äôt planning on hiring me?

But then nothing. It‚Äôs been two weeks so one week overtime. I tried to text and call head hunter several times with no replies. Eventually end of last week he sent an email saying it was a good meeting but the client had some illness etc and were a little behind, but he would get back to me early this week. 

Tuesday afternoon I sent a message saying I had gotten an offer, but wanted to wait for this opportunity before accepting. No response. It‚Äôs now Wednesday evening where I live. 

When a head hunter is saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôll get back early next week‚Äù and I don‚Äôt hear anything eop Wednesday, even touch I disclosed I have another offer. Then I‚Äôm out? Right?

Just so surprised because I have 15 years experience of being a specialist in my field, and they have tried to hire me for years before I accepted being in this process and now. Ghosting!

We'll probably be over it in a couple weeks but for now we want to perfect the experience by finding the ideal surface.

We've been playing in a puzzle box lid but we're facing the typical problem of dice ending up against the edge of the box where they can't be seen by everyone around the table. A low-sided dice tray probably won't work because we like to really huck the dice (90% of the fun in Yahtzee). Dice tower won't work for the same reason. Maybe a transparent box could work, with the right dimensions, but the best I've found doesn't permit disassembly/reassembly, and looks inconvenient to store.

**We want a surface that allows for hard throws and regular spins, and provides complete visibility.**

My best idea so far is a wide wooden bowl with a flat inner bottom, so the dice will come to rest in the middle--something that might slide under the couch or work as a coffee table bowl when not in use. I've found some good candidates on eBay but thought I'd ask before buying in case I'm missing something obvious.

The devs approach of letting anyone play any role and any char, in my opinion, deletes role/char-maining  
  
Ur getting thrown to 3-4 DPS ego-players lobby, who simply cant (or refuse) to play any other role/char. Or even adapting to flyers or divers in time  
Supp mains are getting bullied for doing their job, and not diving together with DPS dudes on frontlane, or just simply break line of site and screams they arent getting healed. And yeah, stuck with 2 playable supps, and the other throw picks (thas irony, but yeah, the choise is limited)  
Tanks end up being solo tanking, stuck on Magneto/Groot (bc Strange should be free for last minute tp), and watch as their team gets ahead of them for no reason. Ot better yet, playing RDD-style from behind  
As a result, supps and tanks are simply burning out way faster than damage-farming boys

The whole approach to the ranked system demands you to be flexible, and to be able to fill roles, but theres simply no need in the eyes of most players bc ""ehh, someone else should but me"". And they are free to think that, actually, u should be free to not be good at, say, hitscan shooters or divers.  
But when you think that - its fine  
When the whole lobby thinks that - thats a sign of a bad system. Not lobby, system as a whole.  
  
And as devs kinda confirmed the existense of loser lobbies, thats just a garanteed bad expirience, like a 10th free cup of coffee, but every 2-3 matches

Im of the opinion that every role and (almost every) char is fun, and i am that flex player whos filling roles bc the devs encourages that. But the pattern i described makes it harder to get enjoyment from a good game

After conversing with many ecom store owners and brainstorming I found the most primary pain point is increasing sales and thrive in market. So I've come up with an idea.

Making an old customer buy again is much cheaper and faster than acquiring new customers, also if they are satisfied with your product they are really going to buy again , but one thing stops them - forgetfulness.

So I'm building this tool which will natively plug into your stores (shopify, woocommerce, bigcommerce), you can add usage days for each product, and when customer orders a product, my tool will track it and send a friendly nudge 5 days before usage days end, you can also have a exclusive coupon or offer for them so they will order again and that shoulder 5 days will cover shipping days, customers can have seamless usage.

Example:

1. Set usage days of coffee = 1 month
2. Customer orders a bottle of coffee.
3. on 25th day morning- Hey! Seems like you‚Äôre pouring fewer scoops lately‚Ä¶ need a refill? Use xxxx for 15% discount.

Guys I really need an advice. I'm really in a dark place right now. Three years ago, I met this guy on a double coffee date. Hindi talaga siya ung ka-date ko pero since friend siya nung nakadate ko, nagkaron kami ng contact. After that night, nothing. We never saw each other again. Fast forward, 2024. Nagmessage ako sa kanya kasi I was going through a breakup (my ex cheated on me) and I needed someone to talk to. Very warm naman siya, he gave me advice, he comforted me a lot. Lahat lahat nasabi ko sa kanya, without holding back cuz he never judged me for anything. He was there for me and I really appreciated that. We talked for weeks until nagdecide kami na magmeet and from there on, nagkaron kami ng casual na set up. Pero before ako pumasok dito, I asked him MANY times if may karelasyon siya, he assured me na wala. Months went by, naging malalim na yung connection namin, label na lang ung kulang. Sabi niya hindi pa siya ready kasi he was the breadwinner in his family. So ako, I waited and waited kasi nagkaron na ako ng feelings and he knew that. Once a month kami nagkikita, either sa bahay niya or outside. And then parang somehow nafefeel ko na may something off sa kanya but I ignored it kasi I trusted him. He told me I can trust me and so I did. Kaso hindi ko mashake ung feeling na may kakaiba so nag investigate ako and just last week, I found out na he is in a 12 year relationship. Nagmessage ako dun sa girl to confirm. Now, galit na galit siya sakin kasi bakit ko daw ginawa yun. Sabi niya he would've sorted things out with her had I waited. Hinihintay nya lang daw dumating ung bata sa tamang edad para masabi niya lahat sa bata. May anak sila (not biologically his, inanako nya; siya kinikilalang tatay; single mom yung gf niya) and he told me na na-strain ung relationship niya sa bata dahil sakin and that I ruined his life. Na walang ibang importante sa kanya kundi ung anak nya.

I feel bad kasi parang sinisisi pa niya ako sa nangyari. Naisip ko tuloy sana hindi ko na lang kinausap yung babae para hindi na nagkagulo, kaso paano naman ako? Paano ung peace of mind ko? Paano ko malalaman ung totoo? He said never naman sya nagcommit sakin so wala akong right gawin ung ginawa ko. Nanghimasok ako sa buhay nila. I know kasalanan ko din because I let this happen, na wala kaming label pero nagkikita at nagde-date kami pero I always told him na he's free to leave me naman if meron siyang ibang gusto. At never ako nagkulang sa pagtatanong sa kanya kung meron bang iba. He always reassured me na WALA. And wala akong nakitang hint na merong iba, I just had this gut feeling na kakaiba and I had to go through lengths para lang maconfirm.

April 2025, 4:00 a.m. Early morning rain showers are starting to fall. The ground is already covered in a layer of frost. It‚Äôs crisp and cold, and the drops falling from the sky are glacial, freezing when they hit the ground if they weren‚Äôt frozen already. April in Michigan has become the new March, and spring doesn‚Äôt really start until the end of May. Under the shelter of an apartment and in his room. A desperately depressed 35 year old male is snoring harshly and slipping deeper into his slumber.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Unbeknownst to him, he is about to flee his rest and stab his ex-wife over 500 times with an 8‚Äù chef‚Äôs knife. Thinking that he‚Äôs sleeping and it‚Äôs just a nightmare, the entire time‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

 Jolted awake by the rumble strips on the side of Michigan Highway 131. He is immediately overcome with the strangest feeling that he‚Äôs ever had. Gathering himself, he tries to wipe the gloss from his eyes but his brains signal sends no reaction to his arm or hand. It appears that he isn‚Äôt in control of his own body. It‚Äôs like he‚Äôs spectating through the optics of someone else. Driving a car, northbound on 131 at 90 MPH. 
Taking a quick glance at the scenery, they‚Äôre well out of his city of residence in Kalamazoo and who ever is at his helm takes a slight right onto the Plainwell/Otsego exit. Familiar to him because it‚Äôs his old hometown but he hates it here. Once off the highway, everywhere is a bad memory that starts to rake up the smoldering bones of his miserable past. 

Blocking it out and catching a flash in the rearview mirror of his reflection but all he sees are his own brown eyes through the two holes cut in the paper bag that he‚Äôs wearing on his head. 
‚ÄúWhat the fuck?,‚Äù He says to himself as he tries to hard swallow. Inaudible with no signal read by his synapses‚Ä¶. Internally flushed with a pale red and nauseous. He inquired to himself again, with uncertainty and objection, ‚ÄúWhy the fuck do I have a paper bag on my head?‚Äù His voice not ejecting from him and his mouth not opening, all of his dialogue is being voiced internally. Unnerved and disconcerted, he is at a loss and can do nothing but literally see this nightmare through. 
Spectating the mystery within his misery while cruising through these antique lands of past failures, 40 miles per hour now down Main Street. Headed towards the center of the Plainwell. He takes in what evidence he can of the now and what the future may hold. 
 
His attire is an old umber corduroy suit. Frayed and with threads hanging in some places. His black boots less than typical for this day an age. It‚Äôs like they were delivered here directly from World War Two. 
The digital clock on the radio flashes 12:00. Only static is penetrating the air waves and in the land of dreams, time is obsolete. The only other sounds are the white noise of the wheels on the pavement and the staggered slapping of the tires going over the cracks on the roadway.    
The vehicle that he‚Äôs in has a hairline fracture in the windshield, and the tan interior rekindles the memory of his old 4-cylinder. A 1992 Saturn SL2. It worked for what he needed it for until it worked no more.For some reason, it‚Äôs been restored to its once-reliable condition for the sake of his nightmare. Or this dream takes place the past. Because it‚Äôs been sitting in a junkyard as a parts car for the last 8 years.  

A stuttering and off time, pounding noise breaks the undeviating slush of the wheels to the pavement and radio buzzing.  Sounding like someone is in the trunk, pounding on the lid from the inside.  
Taking a right on a side street, he pulls off to the side and parks beneath a streetlight. No moths circumscribing the aura of radiance above. The weather within this dream is much warmer than reality. It seems to be a crisp and clear summer‚Äôs night. Not a star in the sky but a wealthy and over embellished full moon is in perfect view. The tall trees lining the street serving as the consummate frame for it.  Neighborhood houses, all around, but not a single glow emanates from their front porches or windows. 
Still only spectating through his eyes while this quandary controls his body. He opens the glove box to reveal the button that opens the trunk. After pressing the button he slams the glove box shut and lifts the armrest of the center console, revealing an 8‚Äù chef‚Äôs knife in a sheath. 
Puzzled, as he‚Äôs never seen the sheath before but there is still a piece of gum and two single Marlboro lights from 8 years ago laying next to it in the console. 
Knife, unsheathed. The muffled cries of panic and fear can already be heard from the rear of the Saturn. He opens the driver‚Äôs side door and steps out. The chef‚Äôs knife still equipped in his right hand‚Äôs grip. He hooks with a pivot to his left toward the trunk that he popped. No traffic, and not another soul around. Not a single bug or moth encompassing any of the side street‚Äôs lights. 
The duct tape muted cries get a little louder as he lifts the lid of the Saturn‚Äôs trunk. It‚Äôs his ex-wife, making those anguished sounds. 
Her bound hands in front of her in zip ties. Ankles and legs tied and bent awkwardly to fit inside of the small trunk. Her terrified eyes were as wide as the light beams from twin lighthouses. Though, He could never seem to keep his ship from her rocks. Her eyeliner‚Äôs rivers rolled down her cheeks, led by mascara boulders. Tumbling down her face like an earthquake ravaged hillside.  
Flowing tears of black, spilled over the duct tape on her mouth. Leaving trails on the silver‚Äôs shine, like the tracks of some terrified souls sprinting through a fresh layer of ashes and soot on the asphalt of a roadway in the aftermath of a volcanic eruption. Running for their lives.  
His paradox handles the knife with the skill of a professional butcher. ‚ÄúThis handle and blade are pure perfection,‚Äù he notes to himself internally, though he is not in control of his actions and movements. The chemistry that he has with the knife is felt through the subject that‚Äôs controlling his body like he‚Äôs used it a million times before. 
His ex wife‚Äôs dampened shrieks, rattle with an extra layer of fear. Still distraught and incapacitated. Tied and sidled in a contortion within the trunk. Seeing the knife, her reality sets in. It‚Äôs like her eyes wanted to pop out of her sweaty and tear soaked skull. To roll away on their own, following her rivers of tears to a delta of nothingness.   
Just when she thought the night couldn‚Äôt get any worse. Projecting panic through her widened lids, she emits a louder scream through the gray tape. 
He can only watch in disbelief as the enigma using his body begins his assault by hoisting the knife high above his head before dropping it straight down with inhuman motion displayed.
Thrusting southward with the speed of a hummingbirds wing and the force of an alligators jaws. 
Spiking with enough ferocity to break her femur or pelvis. Punching with the blade overhand and directly downward. 
 She‚Äôs using her bound arms as a shield, guarding her face and neck with her forearms, but the stabbing commenced with immediate intensity and no target area in mind. Relentlessly, out of control, and just perforating gaping lacerations into her innocent flesh.   
Blood is being thrown in all directions, as he continues stabbing, swift and rapid, illogically nimble and in hyper speed. Transfixing and impaling with no purpose in mind, other than to continue jamming the blade all the way through her. Puncturing with fervor, vehemence, and conviction. 
He stares on at the dismemberment as the gore trails out of each new abrasion like shooting stars. Piercing and skewering with no end in sight. 
The only thing that he can see through his eyes is her scarlet and the splatter of it. Gazing on in horror, he‚Äôs  indifferent to the carnage and not in control. This feels so real to him. From the humidity of the summer air to the viscosity of the carmine on his hands. If it is, how would he prove this to a jury? What would he say in court?    
The impaling and goring finally stops and he stands there. His arms by this side, still with the knife in his right hand. Staring down at the lifeless heap of puncture wounds and visible bone, coated in hues of cerise and maroon. Closing his eyes and inhaling as his ex wife gasps for her last bit of fleeting air and depletes her lungs of her final insufferable breaths‚Ä¶..
Everything went black as he opens his eyes again‚Ä¶.

No longer under the lights of that side street in his hometown and he‚Äôs not viewing an anomaly turn his ex-wife to viscera, entrails and broken bones. Still not awake on his futon at home. 
Instead, he is in shackles‚Ä¶. 
Chained to a concrete cot. In a cage without a door. Very gray and sprinkled with prison bars. Iron and ruinous. Detailed with brown and red specks, crimson chips and runs of rust. Corroded here and there, but mostly abysmal and black. It was like his ex wife‚Äôs mascara boulders, left a trail from this nightmare and back. He‚Äôs regained control of his body but his legs are very weak and in pain so he stays laying prone on the cement bed where he awoke. 
A light scuffing sound is heard down the hall that runs the path in front of the bordering cells to his left as a hooded shadow ambles down the corridor like a wraith. Floating above the ground at a moderate pace, It‚Äôs carrying a single tray of food. When it reaches his cage, it slides the tray under and through the recess in the bars on the floor level of his cell. The figure just stood there in its own ambience in a dark brown robe that was skimming the concrete surface beneath it. Stalking him with its ulterior eyes on its ethereal face. Underneath the shaded guise of its dark and faded hood. 
The off-white and yellow stained, tray has a slice of ham with cranberry sauce that looked more like a raw prime cut of human flesh, covered in blood. A small portion of mashed potatoes off to the side. Garnished with a splatter of the cranberry, ichor. He still couldn‚Äôt speak but he sent a friendly nod to the hooded figure. 
In return, it bowed its head and with phantom hands, it dropped its hood. Revealing that it‚Äôs face looked like a snake‚Äôs. 
It lunged through the bars of the cage, toward his face, but right before the snake‚Äôs split tongue could lick‚Ä¶..he wakes up again‚Ä¶
In his room and on his futon. 

Eyes wide, he sprang from his slumber like an upside down trap door slamming open. Rubbing his eyes vigorously, in an attempt to scrub the hooded figure‚Äôs serpent face from of his memory. 
Dispelled and displeased in the nightmare‚Äôs wake, it certainly didn‚Äôt feel like a vivid dream. ‚ÄúThat felt like the real fucking, thing,‚Äù he grumbles to himself, checking his hands for small cuts and dirt and checking his head for a paper bag, ‚ÄúSo far, so good.‚Äù He contemplates trying to reach his ex wife just to see if she‚Äôs alive but it‚Äôs been 8 years and he thinks better of it. 
Rising to another tired and shitty morning from his oversized futon that he never unfolds into a bed. Descending down the stairs of the apartment that he shares with his sister, Jane. Starting the morning ritual of making a pot of coffee and enjoying a few cups while chain smoking, cigarettes and attempting to log the nights nightmares in his journal. Scribing it as part of his first serious horror novel. Hoping to mainline as a writer without the impedance of all the incessant college loans. 
His legal name is Trent Marshall, and he‚Äôs lived a rough life. Carved out of scrapings and scraps left by the boomers that ruined democracy before it could be enjoyed by any of the generations after. The ones that shamelessly put a price tag on everything and bottled water and called it capitalism. Life started out tough being from a small town in the North/ Midwest US but the punishment that he has levied on himself with questionable choices and reoccurring mistakes, should be noted in his purgatory file. The self mutilation of his mind should be studied and surveyed by the monks living in the mountains of Tebet. 

He wasted time and he missed opportunities to make the most of his life and find a woman that treated him like he deserved because he was too busy chasing a small town whore around the quaint township where they lived for most of his adolescence and on. 
She was vile and awful to him. A habitual liar and manipulator. Intentionally flirtatious with other men and passing it off as just being friendly. For some reason he pursued the picket fences only to share them with a female that treated him far worse than a submissive. Habitually punished for nothing with no silver lining of sex. 
His ex wife accused him of infidelity while she laid on her back, passing herself around to every woman, and man in town. He was already privy to the rule, ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt turn a ho into a housewife.‚Äù Tried it anyway. The results never vary. 
Trent and Kimber, his infamous ex wife, were fortunate not to have any children but Trent wanted more than anything to be a father. He was fertile. His sperm just didn‚Äôt agree with her eggs. This fact would fatally injure their already bedridden relationship, right after they got married. After learning about their infertility and why, Kimber was far too busy fucking everyone else to make it work out or to attempt methods to Increase the likelihood of her getting pregnant. 
When Trent was just 15 years old, he met Kimber and his sanity began to unravel. Like a new millennium Medusa, she unlaced him and tied him back together in a noose. . The destroyer of his adolescence. 
Fucked him up in the worst way. Damaged his goods before they even had a chance gain interest and planted bombs that wouldn‚Äôt detonate until much later in his life. but by then, the damage was already done.. 
They split up forever, after his 28th birthday. Only 7 months after they tied the knot. After a relationship that lasted longer than ten years. 
Doing what he could to ignore her damage and the wasted time while he did his own thing. Singing for several different local heavy metal bands, going places but never making it anywhere. Playing the field, fucking some model types here and there and he was always careful not to spread his seed to any of the broads that he laid, in between. 
Presently, Trent is 35 years old. He doesn‚Äôt look it, he looks more like a senior in college. The ass end of his prime. Single and manic depressed with more baggage than an old war hero.  
Still, all of his hair is intact, A residual 6 pack from flexing his diaphragm while screaming sweet nothings into an old Shure microphone. 6 feet tall and 152, No dad bod but he still has cut lines. Never clean shaved, sometimes soft spoken. 10 years sober from alcohol but the other demons still bite. No face tattoos but you never know where the night may take you. 
Living dangerously, and never preparing for any type of future. Passionate about his opinions but it‚Äôs only because he wants someone as passionate as he is to prove him wrong. He‚Äôs wrong, a lot and sometimes on purpose and he doesn‚Äôt mind it as long as you prove yourself right. 


The recklessness of weekend shows and working nowhere jobs day to day, night to night has caught up to him. Now he‚Äôs just a burnt out, burn out, that lived his best years first and now, at 35, there is no reason to live at all. 
Physicians and prescriptions may keep suicide distilled but he‚Äôs fresh out of unanswered prayers and unable to own a gun. No job, no prospects and his will to work another nowhere job is fleeting. He is convinced that there is no place for him here on Earth. It‚Äôs the curiosity and drugs, keeping the noose from his neck.

I am still in shock. Yesterday, around 5pm, my cat was ran over and sadly crossed the rainbow bridge. Our next door neighbors didn‚Äôt see her pulling into their driveway, and ran right over my baby. 

My partner was getting home from work when she saw what had happened as soon as she pulled up. I was inside doing house chores. She came inside, already distraught, and told me the news. I did NOT want to see the aftermath but wanted to tell my babygirl goodbye. A part of me is glad that I did, another part of me cannot stop replaying what I saw. I am absolutely traumatized and cannot even begin to explain how heavy my heart is right now. 

Our baby found us in May - she came right up to our front porch when we were outside doing yard work and she never left. She made friends with the neighbors 2 houses up from us & we basically ‚Äúshared custody‚Äù of this sweet girl. 

Although we only had her in our lives for 3 months, she made such an impression on us. We had our routine and you could tell how happy and loved she felt.

I guess I‚Äôm coming here for advice. Advice on how to cope with losing a fur baby in such a traumatic & tragic way. My heart also hurts for our next door neighbor who was the driver. In hindsight, I know it was truly an accident (she loved that cat too - our babygirl would go over every morning and say hi to them while they drank their coffee outside). I just don‚Äôt know how to move forward - I know it‚Äôs still so fresh, but I just need help. I don‚Äôt know how to stop thinking about her final moments - every thought around it, I have had it. And it‚Äôs hard for me to navigate next steps when my mind cannot stop thinking about the worst parts of it. I am a puddle every single time I think about it‚Ä¶ which is all the time right now.

1n1oqxu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/1n1oqxu/sharing_my_cursed_jar_against_my_abuser_of_sa/,Sharing my Cursed Jar against my abuser of S/A,"Hi everyone, this will be a long post. This is a curse jar I made against my abuser (S/A) on the new moon following the help/suggestions of other redditor that came in support of one of my post. I sadly did not take any pictures of the jar. Sorry for any grammar mistake English isn‚Äôt my first language. A big thank you for those who shared their tricks, I kinda did a big mix of what I was able to do with the suggestions. Here we go :

**Ingredients:**

**Dust, powder¬†or oils :** Deer tongue, hell‚Äôs devil oil (or any extra hexing oil or powder that feels right), DUME (oil or powder), black hoodo hex powder, hot foot oil, restless oil, justice oil (I didn‚Äôt have any goofer or grave powder, but it was intended)

**Herbs / food :** Lemon, onion, scorpio pepper, instant coffee (I actually forgot it), red pepper flakes, poppy seed, a piece of meat, mugworth (a lot), cinnamon, clove, salt, plantan (a lot), garlic, I went in my backyard and took any destructive or invasive plants

**Other :** obviously a jar, taglock with their name and date of birth (parchement paper, or what is available, I used some birch that I collected in the forest), rusty pin, rusty nails, broken glass, 3 black candles with their name and birthday, liquor, instead of googly eyes I used candy in shape of eyes not to harm too much nature with plastic, justice card, foil, molding/rotten food, some dirt, and a bone I found in my backyard (rib), their picture.

**Other things** I wanted to use but didn‚Äôt have in hand: calamus, licorice root, Carolina reaper or ghost pepper, poison ivy, razor blades, shattered mirror, mirror, death bugs

**Steps:**

First, ground yourself and meditate. Protect yourself, the members of the house and the house. I cleansed it with Hekate. You can meditate and imagine what you want, you can also think about it all along of the spell.

Then, I made a circle (salt, eggshells, herbs associated with protection), just in case I did an oopsy. You can also make it before the protection spell and meditation

If you work with any deity, you can make them a candle and give them an offering to invite them to join you to your spell.

When your done and have everything, take the lemon and put one deep cut into it (don‚Äôt slice all the way through though) and add his taglock, you can do the same with the Scorpio pepper (I did both). Pin it back together with the rusty nails

Petition :

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† By the light broken

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† By the ashes of wrong

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Let (target) feel what they have done

Add it to your jar and start adding the rest of the ingredients, (The ingredients are flexible, basically add what you feel is right for hexing, confusion, harm. You can add poisons or chemicals as well but be careful with anything that will interact badly (don‚Äôt add bleach and ammonia for example or anything that could combust, explode, or create poisonous gas)). I had 13 mini spells (Justice, Karma, Truth, Tongue loosener, Stop lying about me / Stop talking badly about me, Vengeance, Haunted, Destruction, Confusion, Guilt, etc) that I put in and said what I wanted, ex : if you don‚Äôt tell the truth, you‚Äôll destroy your life, If your refuse to admit what you did, you will suffer more than I did, the more you refuses to let the truth be, the more you‚Äôll lose sleep and have nightmare, if you tried to run away from the truth, your legs will burn, if you try to hide the truth, you‚Äôll have difficulty breathing, etc.‚Äù The point of this curse, is if I can get Justice because he admits, the curse can be lifted, but if I get justice because I fought for it or I don‚Äôt get it, well he‚Äôs staying cursed with the intention of it getting worse everyday. 

I also said if he tried to : hurt me, return what I'm returning, lift the curse, protect himself, the pain will be x3. I also said that anyone who tries to help him, will get the effect of the spell, because helping a rapist is absolutly wrong and I consider them complice of all the pain he did to me even if they weren't there. (IDK if it's realist that the spell will be able do to that, but my intentions are clear) 

Don‚Äôt add all the ingredients, you will use some of them for the candles and the meat. As you‚Äôre adding the rest of the stuff, keep chanting your intentions and let all your anger flow into it. Don‚Äôt hold back. It helps you and it fires up the energy into the jar. Whatever you do put all of your hurt, anger and loathing into it and make it symbolic of your desired outcome magick works it's best when it is original to you and has every last ounce of yourself you can spare to put into it. Creating your own work will always be better than using someone else's. I put some 3DG and Disturbed while doing everything, it hyped my mood and made me feel good.

As you're anointing the black candles and rolling / putting them in the main herb mix of the curse jar, say "":

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† This candle is (abuser) whatever I do to it , gets done to him.

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† By north, south , east and west . By earth, air, water and fire it is now as I desire.""

Proceed to stick needles, broken pieces of glass, anything sharp really, while saying :

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† These pains you'll feel until you confess your to crimes , all your crimes , loudly and for all to hear . Loudly you'll declare by powers of fire and powers of air.

Inscribe the rune Tiwaz into the candle and say (I forgot to write the rune honestly, but I said this incantation while stabbing them, hurting them again):

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† You did what you did, but peace does not follow

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Regret will rise behind you

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Like a shadow at dusk

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Ever longer, ever darker

Do this for every candle, and the same with the piece of meat, I had a chicken breast: anoint and put the herbs but I also stick their picture on it, then proceed to stab it, and put the nasty needles and stuff.

Let the candles burn, if possible, on top of the jar

Put the eyes on it, with the justice card beside (to let the court see what he has done) and in front of a mirror so he can be reminded of what he did (I didn‚Äôt have a mirror, so I put small piece of foils that I had).

After (when your done), I cleaned the inside of my circle with Chinese wash and keep it in the salt circle for the night with the candles and offering of the deities. Don't forget to take a cleansing bath / shower when done done done!

I started around 14h37 and ended around 3 AM (this includes the preparation of the herbs and mini spell). I did the spell on the new moon, I didn't expect to be that long, honestly I didn't see the time past it felt like 2-3h).

The next day I threw the jars in the closest trash bin close to me which was the church‚Äôs trash, I didn‚Äôt want to keep it in the house because it was a very heavy jar I wasn‚Äôt able to shake it (big Costco pickle jar), and also because I had too much stuff in there (too much vinegar) and ended up with 2 jars, and I didn‚Äôt want the smell in my house (since sadly the big jar was leaking a bit).

I cleaned my basement again and remove the salt circle. 3 days after the spell I thanked again the deities I worked with and buried the offerings near a tree, I washed it again with pinesol and Chinese wash.

5 days later (today) I had a dream (I‚Äôll try to explain it clearly as possible) : He was going upstairs because he didn't want to be near me (idk why we were in the same house, we don‚Äôt live together and never did, but it's like if we were living in the same house and I decided to take the basement and he needed to leave and go live upstairs which was a smaller space), but before he could go up, he sat at the bottom of the stairs because he saw me and was afraid. With my right hand I took his face and dug my nails in his cheek until they bled and continued to dig them as hard as I could while he was paralyzed in fear, I felt powerful, when I looked at him I made a joke that ‚ÄúI missed this little face‚Äù and pushed it away, he ran upstairs bleeding and afraid, he tried to come back at me, but I was making another small spell/hex/curse/idk (a small black candles with herbs), I think it was with Persephone, it felt like if I made another spell/curse to protect what I did and boost it? Not sure about that part, Anyway, it felt good seeing my abuser almost on his knees crying in fear, the feeling of my nails in his cheeks were so real and very satisfaying lol.

Also wanted to mention : I did 3 days of protection before the spell and I think that is what helped me that I didn‚Äôt feel too drained, I actually felt less heavy after it, like a weight was gone, I wasn‚Äôt angry at him anymore, he wasn‚Äôt my problem, I think it‚Äôs because either magik is real or not (I truly believe it‚Äôs real), it‚Äôs sort of therapeutic, I mean I stabbed a chicken with his picture on it and put rusty nails in his eyes, I let go of my fear, I talked during the spell like I was talking to him, telling him what I thought of him, and what should and will happened to him, and that I‚Äôll fight to get Justice and I‚Äôll get it, not just for me but for all my friends and victims that have been through the same to maybe show there is still hope in this corrupted system.

I am super open to any opinion, what could I have done better? What things maybe I didn‚Äôt do right or should not have done? Any interpretation of the dream? Anything would be helpful, I am trying to get better. Since the spell, I try no the think about it, when a thought of him comes up, I tell myself ‚Äúthe universe will take care of him, I did my part, I don‚Äôt need to worry, you can‚Äôt hurt me anymore‚Äù.

Sorry for any grammar mistake, English isn‚Äôt my first language.

Again, I would like to thank very much all the people that took time to suggest stuff, even if it was just an ingredients or support, it was a very ‚Äúnice project‚Äù to make and I hope this version of cursed jar can be helpful to others",6,1756318671.0,Spells,2,1.0,False

After conversing with many ecom store owners and brainstorming I found the most primary pain point is increasing sales and thrive in market. So I've come up with an idea.

Making an old customer buy again is much cheaper and faster than acquiring new customers, also if they are satisfied with your product they are really going to buy again , but one thing stops them - forgetfulness.

So I'm building this tool which will natively plug into your stores (shopify, woocommerce, bigcommerce), you can add usage days for each product, and when customer orders a product, my tool will track it and send a friendly nudge 5 days before usage days end, you can also have a exclusive coupon or offer for them so they will order again and that shoulder 5 days will cover shipping days, customers can have seamless usage.

Example:

1. Set usage days of coffee = 1 month
2. Customer orders a bottle of coffee.
3. on 25th day morning- Hey! Seems like you‚Äôre pouring fewer scoops lately‚Ä¶ need a refill? Use xxxx for 15% discount.

**Dust, powder¬†or oils :** Deer tongue, hell‚Äôs devil oil (or any extra hexing oil or powder that feels right), DUME (oil or powder), black hoodo hex powder, hot foot oil, restless oil, justice oil (I didn‚Äôt have any goofer or grave powder, but it was intended)

**Herbs / food :** Lemon, onion, scorpio pepper, instant coffee (I actually forgot it), red pepper flakes, poppy seed, a piece of meat, mugworth (a lot), cinnamon, clove, salt, plantan (a lot), garlic, I went in my backyard and took any destructive or invasive plants

**Other :** obviously a jar, taglock with their name and date of birth (parchement paper, or what is available, I used some birch that I collected in the forest), rusty pin, rusty nails, broken glass, 3 black candles with their name and birthday, liquor, instead of googly eyes I used candy in shape of eyes not to harm too much nature with plastic, justice card, foil, molding/rotten food, some dirt, and a bone I found in my backyard (rib), their picture.

**Other things** I wanted to use but didn‚Äôt have in hand: calamus, licorice root, Carolina reaper or ghost pepper, poison ivy, razor blades, shattered mirror, mirror, death bugs

**Steps:**

First, ground yourself and meditate. Protect yourself, the members of the house and the house. I cleansed it with Hekate. You can meditate and imagine what you want, you can also think about it all along of the spell.

Then, I made a circle (salt, eggshells, herbs associated with protection), just in case I did an oopsy. You can also make it before the protection spell and meditation

If you work with any deity, you can make them a candle and give them an offering to invite them to join you to your spell.

When your done and have everything, take the lemon and put one deep cut into it (don‚Äôt slice all the way through though) and add his taglock, you can do the same with the Scorpio pepper (I did both). Pin it back together with the rusty nails

Petition :

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† By the light broken

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† By the ashes of wrong

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Let (target) feel what they have done

Add it to your jar and start adding the rest of the ingredients, (The ingredients are flexible, basically add what you feel is right for hexing, confusion, harm. You can add poisons or chemicals as well but be careful with anything that will interact badly (don‚Äôt add bleach and ammonia for example or anything that could combust, explode, or create poisonous gas)). I had 13 mini spells (Justice, Karma, Truth, Tongue loosener, Stop lying about me / Stop talking badly about me, Vengeance, Haunted, Destruction, Confusion, Guilt, etc) that I put in and said what I wanted, ex : if you don‚Äôt tell the truth, you‚Äôll destroy your life, If your refuse to admit what you did, you will suffer more than I did, the more you refuses to let the truth be, the more you‚Äôll lose sleep and have nightmare, if you tried to run away from the truth, your legs will burn, if you try to hide the truth, you‚Äôll have difficulty breathing, etc.‚Äù The point of this curse, is if I can get Justice because he admits, the curse can be lifted, but if I get justice because I fought for it or I don‚Äôt get it, well he‚Äôs staying cursed with the intention of it getting worse everyday. 

I also said if he tried to : hurt me, return what I'm returning, lift the curse, protect himself, the pain will be x3. I also said that anyone who tries to help him, will get the effect of the spell, because helping a rapist is absolutly wrong and I consider them complice of all the pain he did to me even if they weren't there. (IDK if it's realist that the spell will be able do to that, but my intentions are clear). 

Don‚Äôt add all the ingredients, you will use some of them for the candles and the meat. As you‚Äôre adding the rest of the stuff, keep chanting your intentions and let all your anger flow into it. Don‚Äôt hold back. It helps you and it fires up the energy into the jar. Whatever you do put all of your hurt, anger and loathing into it and make it symbolic of your desired outcome magick works it's best when it is original to you and has every last ounce of yourself you can spare to put into it. Creating your own work will always be better than using someone else's. I put some 3DG and Disturbed while doing everything, it hyped my mood and made me feel good.

As you're anointing the black candles and rolling / putting them in the main herb mix of the curse jar, say "":

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† This candle is (abuser) whatever I do to it , gets done to him.

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† By north, south , east and west . By earth, air, water and fire it is now as I desire.""

Proceed to stick needles, broken pieces of glass, anything sharp really, while saying :

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† These pains you'll feel until you confess your to crimes , all your crimes , loudly and for all to hear . Loudly you'll declare by powers of fire and powers of air.

Inscribe the rune Tiwaz into the candle and say (I forgot to write the rune honestly, but I said this incantation while stabbing them, hurting them again):

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† You did what you did, but peace does not follow

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Regret will rise behind you

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Like a shadow at dusk

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Ever longer, ever darker

Do this for every candle, and the same with the piece of meat, I had a chicken breast: anoint and put the herbs but I also stick their picture on it, then proceed to stab it, and put the nasty needles and stuff.

Let the candles burn, if possible, on top of the jar

Put the eyes on it, with the justice card beside (to let the court see what he has done) and in front of a mirror so he can be reminded of what he did (I didn‚Äôt have a mirror, so I put small piece of foils that I had).

After (when your done), I cleaned the inside of my circle with Chinese wash and keep it in the salt circle for the night with the candles and offering of the deities. Don't forget to take a cleansing bath / shower when done done done!

I started around 14h37 and ended around 3 AM (this includes the preparation of the herbs and mini spell). I did the spell on the new moon, I didn't expect to be that long, honestly I didn't see the time past it felt like 2-3h).

The next day I threw the jars in the closest trash bin close to me which was the church‚Äôs trash, I didn‚Äôt want to keep it in the house because it was a very heavy jar I wasn‚Äôt able to shake it (big Costco pickle jar), and also because I had too much stuff in there (too much vinegar) and ended up with 2 jars, and I didn‚Äôt want the smell in my house (since sadly the big jar was leaking a bit).

I cleaned my basement again and remove the salt circle. 3 days after the spell I thanked again the deities I worked with and buried the offerings near a tree, I washed it again with pinesol and Chinese wash.

5 days later (today) I had a dream (I‚Äôll try to explain it clearly as possible) : He was going upstairs because he didn't want to be near me (idk why we were in the same house, we don‚Äôt live together and never did, but it's like if we were living in the same house and I decided to take the basement and he needed to leave and go live upstairs which was a smaller space), but before he could go up, he sat at the bottom of the stairs because he saw me and was afraid. With my right hand I took his face and dug my nails in his cheek until they bled and continued to dig them as hard as I could while he was paralyzed in fear, I felt powerful, when I looked at him I made a joke that ‚ÄúI missed this little face‚Äù and pushed it away, he ran upstairs bleeding and afraid, he tried to come back at me, but I was making another small spell/hex/curse/idk (a small black candles with herbs), I think it was with Persephone, it felt like if I made another spell/curse to protect what I did and boost it? Not sure about that part, Anyway, it felt good seeing my abuser almost on his knees crying in fear, the feeling of my nails in his cheeks were so real and very satisfaying lol.

Also wanted to mention : I did 3 days of protection before the spell and I think that is what helped me that I didn‚Äôt feel too drained, I actually felt less heavy after it, like a weight was gone, I wasn‚Äôt angry at him anymore, he wasn‚Äôt my problem, I think it‚Äôs because either magik is real or not (I truly believe it‚Äôs real), it‚Äôs sort of therapeutic, I mean I stabbed a chicken with his picture on it and put rusty nails in his eyes, I let go of my fear, I talked during the spell like I was talking to him, telling him what I thought of him, and what should and will happened to him, and that I‚Äôll fight to get Justice and I‚Äôll get it, not just for me but for all my friends and victims that have been through the same to maybe show there is still hope in this corrupted system.

I am super open to any opinion, what could I have done better? What things maybe I didn‚Äôt do right or should not have done? Any interpretation of the dream? Anything would be helpful, I am trying to get better. Since the spell, I try no the think about it, when a thought of him comes up, I tell myself ‚Äúthe universe will take care of him, I did my part, I don‚Äôt need to worry, you can‚Äôt hurt me anymore‚Äù.

Sorry for any grammar mistake, English isn‚Äôt my first language.

Again, I would like to thank very much all the people that took time to suggest stuff, even if it was just an ingredients or support, it was a very ‚Äúnice project‚Äù to make and I hope this version of cursed jar can be helpful to others.",3,1756318566.0,blackmagic,0,1.0,False
1n1oone,https://www.reddit.com/r/Somalia/comments/1n1oone/my_cunning_xalimo/,My Cunning Xalimoüòî,"Story time,

So I started a new job, and there were a few Somali girls working there. Naturally, I gravitated toward them and would chat with them since they are my people. But there was this one girl who always seemed to be on her own.

She was easily the cutest one there, which confused me, why‚Äôs she always by solo dolo? So I went over and got to know her. Just small talk at first, but one thing stood out, she had the same name as my mom, this has to be destiny right. Then out of nowhere our female manager comes over and hugs her, showing her so much love, mind you this is only the first week of us working here.

When the manager left, I asked her if they were close, like did you know her from before? Fam I kid you not her mood from bubbly/inviting/happy went to the quickest straight face ice cold vibe. She looks at me and tells me ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm just using her‚Äù. She starts showing me imsgs of her sweet talking the manager, even followed her on socials. She explained that I am only friending her up because I can pick my shifts and get as much hours as I want.

Bro when I heard that, I was sooo turned on by her cunning nature, her cleverness, the way she thinks steps ahead. Days went on I started chilling with her more, like she was such a good person yet cunning. The other Somali girls some knew from before kept asking why are you talking to her she‚Äôs weird and other insults randomly bro. She never did nothing to them, the way I defended the LOML name they never talked about her again. Plus she had my mom‚Äôs name too.

But eventually she told me she had took the vaccine and a couple boosters, had to let it go. Like with her I should have let that slide. We both ended up leaving the company, I had no socials so I never kept in touch.

Randomly after I came back from Umrah couple months later, I see her sitting at the arrivals coffee shop probably waiting for family, she didn‚Äôt see me. I wanted her back so I came up with a plan, keep it nonchalant and just go buy coffee and act like you ran into her. I make my order, put a little perfume on, grab my order and the second I turn around she..she‚Ä¶.she was goneüíî

1n1oon9,https://www.reddit.com/r/InstagramMarketing/comments/1n1oon9/building_something_for_ecommerce_stores/,Building something for ecommerce stores,"Hey All,

After conversing with many ecom store owners and brainstorming I found the most primary pain point is increasing sales and thrive in market. So I've come up with an idea.

Making an old customer buy again is much cheaper and faster than acquiring new customers, also if they are satisfied with your product they are really going to buy again , but one thing stops them - forgetfulness.

So I'm building this tool which will natively plug into your stores (shopify, woocommerce, bigcommerce), you can add usage days for each product, and when customer orders a product, my tool will track it and send a friendly nudge 5 days before usage days end, you can also have a exclusive coupon or offer for them so they will order again and that shoulder 5 days will cover shipping days, customers can have seamless usage.

Example:

1. Set usage days of coffee = 1 month
2. Customer orders a bottle of coffee.
3. on 25th day morning- Hey! Seems like you‚Äôre pouring fewer scoops lately‚Ä¶ need a refill? Use xxxx for 15% discount.

Please check and let me know what u feel -¬†https://tally.so/r/mVKGD6",1,1756318530.0,InstagramMarketing,1,1.0,False

1n1onoe,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1n1onoe/does_waterdrop_wdf05_refrigerator_water_filter/,Does Waterdrop WD-F05 Refrigerator Water Filter Deliver Quality? A Detailed Review,"The Waterdrop WD-F05 refrigerator water filter immediately caught my attention due to its hefty 4.8-star average rating based on thousands of reviews. As someone who experiences water quality issues on a regular basis, I was eager to try it out and put its claims to the test. Its promise of removing chlorine, odor, and even rust using a high-efficiency activated coconut shell carbon block sounded like just what my household needed. Over the past several weeks, I‚Äôve swapped out my fridge‚Äôs filter for this one to uncover how it stacks up against competitors. Below is my account of its performance, strengths, and areas where it falls short.

**Practical Design and Convenient Installation**  
The first thing I noticed about the replacement filter was its sleek dimensions of 9.53‚Äù x 3.34‚Äù x 5.59‚Äù. It‚Äôs incredibly compact yet has the heft you'd expect from a solidly constructed product, weighing slightly under two pounds. Installation proved to be a breeze; not a single tool was needed. I followed the instructions provided and had everything set up in less than five minutes. This was a welcome surprise as previous filters I‚Äôve bought often required fiddling or forced adjustments to prevent leaks. With this one, the fit was seamless, and not a single drop escaped.

**[Ready to snag Waterdrop WD-F05? See Amazon pricing.](https://usedwater.com/price/b01ca411si/)**  

**Filtration That Improves Taste**  
When it comes to water, taste matters as much as purity. Within days, I noticed a marked improvement in the flavor of my cold drinks and even my coffee. The 100% Sri Lankan-made coconut shell carbon block works as the primary filtration material and significantly reduces impurities like chlorine, bad odors, and cysts. Another added benefit is that it maintains essential minerals, which is comforting if you're conscious about water quality beyond just purification. My kids, who normally avoid drinking tap water, now drink straight from the fridge dispenser without complaints‚Äîa feat in itself!

**Winning Points**  
- Easy, tool-free installation  
- Significant improvement in the taste and quality of water  
- Prevents leakage with its precision manufacturing  
- Includes handy install stickers to monitor its 6-month or 300-gallon lifespan  

**Does It Have Any Drawbacks?**  
It‚Äôs not all perfect, though. While the product performs admirably, one critique I have is the slightly high initial price tag. For budget users, it might feel steep upfront, although the three-pack somewhat mitigates this. Additionally, though it‚Äôs compatible with numerous refrigerator models, you‚Äôll want to double-check compatibility if you‚Äôre rocking a lesser-known fridge brand. I‚Äôve come across a few reviews where users struggled with compatibility, though I faced no issues personally with my LG unit.

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Not the most affordable upfront option in its category  
- Requires confirmation of compatibility for certain fridge models  

**Material Quality and Certifications**  
What sets this filter apart from cheaper options is the premium material used in its construction. Unlike some other activated carbon filters that rely on coal or nutshells, this model stands apart with its higher-efficiency coconut-shell carbon block. The NSF 42/372 certification backs up its claims for safe usage by removing harmful impurities. While certifications might not faze everyone, for me, it's a comforting sign of quality assurance.

**Other Options to Compare**  
During my research, I found that this filter competes closely with the Whirlpool EveryDrop and Samsung DA29-00020B filters. The Waterdrop‚Äôs advantage lies in its cost per use‚Äîcoming in a three-pack helps keep long-term costs manageable. While Whirlpool might slightly edge out the Waterdrop in sediment filtration, this filter excels better in chlorine reduction and taste refinement. Samsung‚Äôs filters, on the other hand, fall behind in ease of setup, requiring additional tools in some cases. Overall, I kept coming back to this one for its balance of performance, longevity, and practicality.

**Price Worthiness**  
Comparing features, convenience, and water quality improvements, this product sits at a sweet mid-point of affordability and efficacy. In the context of what you're getting‚Äîimproved taste, reduced contaminants, and a hassle-free six-month lifespan‚Äîit justifies the cost well. Its inclusion of three filters per pack further boosts its value compared to pricier single-filter options.

Please answer because ive written on other subreddits some time ago and i barely got answers and atp i really dont know what to do. Feel free to dm me as well, PLEASEüôèüôèüôè

im gonna start with some context and background story: Im a female, 19 years old and have been having anxiety/panick attacks for almost year and a half now.

They started off from stress (mainly from too many things to do and handle -> practice sports, school, theater, studying etc etc).

The thing is that im a VERY active person, as in i feel bad (useless) at the end of the day if i havent done anything because since i was little i kept an active lifestyle (sports, studying, social life, gaming)

Also, im an outgoing person, an extrovert and have never had problems such as depression, social anxiety and anxiety in general... until now.

My attacks happen ONLY AT NIGHT, when i think that im about to go to sleep i start panicking.

i have periods of time when im super super chill (i even thought i managed to 'cure' from them) and periods of time (like rn) when i feel like i have every problem in the world when it comes to panick attacks. they get worse if i dont sleep at home since i sometimes get them in my own bed. 

My panick attacks are very different:

-sometimes i feel like im about to vomit, i feel full, i feel like i need to poop (sorry if its gross)

-sometimes i feel like my heart is RACING and i cant breathe

-sometimes i have this feeling where a strong emotion would fill my whole chest and expand to my whole body making it literally go numb

-the worst: im freezing (even if its 40¬∫) i start shaking uncontrollably, i feel like vomiting, i have that weird emotion in my chest etc. 

-sometimes i js start shaking but im chill and relaxed, sometimes im panicked but i dont shake, sometimes i feel like dying 

Trust me guys, ive tried almost EVERYTHING: 

-breathing only helps w slowing my heart down , but it makes me feel like i get even less air in my lungs and it makes me dizzy

-masturbation sometimes works if im not too panicked

-dance works but not everytime

-tiktok sometimes helps

-my go to combo is taking a pill to make me sleep (natural: melatonin + valerian + B vitamin) and tiktok so i distract my mind. 

-i stopped smoking (iqos) at least 2h before going to sleep, stopped drinking alcohol, never drink coffee, eat sugar or things that could get my energy up

My dream is to travel the world.

ive booked a vacation (in 2 weeks im going on it) that is mainly based on going all day to the beach or staying on a boat (which is one of the best feelings in the world for me). im gonna travel alone w my bf and its gonna be my first time away w literally no adult that could take care of me. im already feeling anxious about the fact that what if a panick attack is gonna occur. im scared that by staying in the sun, lack of a lot of sleep and very hot temperature is gonna worsen my anxiety/panick. 

Thank you very much for reading my yapp and im really looking forward to an answer a solution or js someone to talk to ab this. üíóüíóüíóik its gonna be fine and for whoever is reading this that feels the same as i do ITS GONNA BE OKEY I PROMISE
