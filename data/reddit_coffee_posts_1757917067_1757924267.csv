Hi All

I am having an issue with my Mara X. It has been running fine for almost two years, but I am noticing the following symptoms:

- the drip tray is filling up extremely quickly (usually full up in a day, after making two or three Coffees).
- the water purging area of the e61 is always hissing, and it gets much lounder at high pressures.

Junkie - March 24 to May 18

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs bold thugs, but there‚Äôs never old thugs,‚Äù Adam‚Äôs father spoke with a sneer as he drove two knuckles into the boy‚Äôs sternum with a sharp prod.

Adam could still picture that day clearly, even now at 54. His father had been a bold thug, warning his son not to stray on the same path. Adam frowned a little deeper remembering his dad never lived to see 30. Hell, he never lived to see 26. His life cut short in a turf war by a barrage of bullets, one tearing through his father‚Äôs brain matter and another biting deeply into Adam‚Äôs shoulder at the tender age of 9 while the pair were at home. When the hailstorm ended moments after starting, Adam sobbed and cried for his father, clinging desperately to consciousness as he rolled over to see his father‚Äôs empty face: only a small bit of syrupy blood visible against his father‚Äôs messy, dark hair and a crimson tear from his swollen eye. The boy‚Äôs whimpering faded and his father‚Äôs lifeless expression seared into his memory against the backdrop of the arid, Los Angelos section 8 ghetto.

Adam rubbed his shoulder in response to phantom pain, sighing as he wondered what his father would think of him now. In his younger days, Adam had worked odd jobs in construction. It was fast and decent money at the time. And between that he moved lesser drugs and gambled, the sour smell of cigarettes and hangovers ever present on his unkempt attire and breath. He loved pills when he could get them, but as his age advanced he increasingly found himself settling for heroin or fent when he couldn‚Äôt fight for the good stuff, but he wasn‚Äôt a junkie, he convinced himself. He regularly sported a black eye or a fat lip, and that much was true even in present days. He was getting too old for this shit. And in thug years, he was ancient. 

He had settled down at one point with a homely woman named Josefa and had a few pups of his own. But he never had the opportunity to poke his firm fingers into their chests like his father had to him because he returned to the concrete jungle before they were old enough to learn that a lesson. Never learning that lesson himself, he held a grudge to the gang that took his father, but had refused allegiance to the opposing side as well. One day he gulped grain alcohol and sulked, feeling emboldened to make his enemies‚Äô day as unpleasant as they had made his so many years ago. 

The sound of shattering glass was much louder than Adam had intended, but his inebriation left him too confident and too foolish. He used another brick to remove the remaining shards of the window. The store he broke into was a front, but at least he knew that the night he chose was a rare evening that his old nemesis was mostly occupied. They were still downstairs, but the music they played would be too loud to hear the glass, and the air would be too thick with tar smoke and drugs to guide any coherent worry, he assured himself. Undoubtedly, he was being reckless. He took one last gulp, smashed the bottle against a rickety book shelf, and threw the match into the pool of bitter alcohol after he lit up the last menthol in his pocket.

The blaze quickly grabbed purchase on the light fuels of the shelf and spread to the raggedy curtains near the window. Now they licked against the ceiling until they fully spilled up and smoke began to pour into the room. Adam discarded the empty case of cigarettes into the growing fire, eyes flickering with embers, and stumbled back towards his entry point. 

He mistook the first bullet for a bee whirring by his head, and he let gravity do the rest of his escape through the shattered window. He rolled on the ground and patted his ear, shocked to see blood. Briefly the memory of his father flashed behind his eyes and his heart raced. He clumsily pushed himself up and ran in whatever direction his body wanted to go. 

‚ÄúNot bees,‚Äù he thought, ‚Äúwasps.‚Äù 

The inferno was really going now, and people poured from the derelict shop exactly as hornets do to protect their brood. Another buzz followed by the ping of a bullet ricocheting off of a run down Explorer a few paces beside him. A third buzz, but this one found its mark in Adam‚Äôs buttocks. He yelped and fell forward, thrashing like a wounded horse on a race track and hurling profanities, but adrenaline urged him forward and he rolled under another car for temporary haven.

He survived that night. The bullet rested in the fat of his ass. He tended the wound on his own, keeping his head down as not to draw attention and place him there that night as the inebriated arsonist. Who would suspect a worn out 54 year old gang banger anyways? He thought of his escape.

‚ÄúYou got family up there?‚Äù The social worker spoke flatly, keyboard clicking behind her vacant words and exaggerated fake nails.

‚ÄúYes ma‚Äôam,‚Äù Adam lied sheepishly. 

She was silent, sternly reading her screen. ‚ÄúWell, if you test negative you can leave tomorrow. Corona is overwhelming the shelters here, the ones up there seem to be keeping it at bay. I guess it‚Äôs a good idea to leave.‚Äù She paused to glare at him. ‚ÄúGo see the medic for the test, then I‚Äôll get you on the plane.‚Äù

A couple days later, Adam sat in the center of his cot at the congregate shelter far from the streets he knew, with shoulders slouched and eyes low, body trembling and sweating. Andrea plodded toward him.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a new face,‚Äù She spoke with a touch of questioning, hoping for a free response.

He was silent.

‚ÄúI know I‚Äôm in uniform, but I‚Äôm not out to get you.‚Äù She started, watching him try to steady the shakes. ‚ÄúWhen did you start withdrawals?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a junkie,‚Äù his hispanic accent was always sharpest when he was offended.

Andrea‚Äôs expression spoke more than anything she could say as she shot him an incredulous scowl. Adam‚Äôs eyes darted with guilt.

‚ÄúThis is day two or three,‚Äù he spoke quietly, barely above a murmur.

She stooped to meet his height and held out a hand. Adam lifted his to hers, shaking, and she wrapped her cool fingertips around his wrist to feel his pulse. It was fast, a bit weak, but still strong enough to be acceptable.

‚ÄúAre they getting worse?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôve stayed the same for about a day,‚Äù he whispered.

‚ÄúOkay. If they get worse, you need medical attention.‚Äù She gently tucked his hand into his lap and her eyes were wrought with concern.

‚ÄúYes ma‚Äôam,‚Äù Adam eased a bit, ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôve done this. I know what to expect.‚Äù 

She nodded and pulled a couple ginger candies from her pocket, ‚Äúthese might take the edge off the nausea.‚Äù She said with a smile. She also handed him her card, assuring him that even though it said PD that she was more concerned about seeing him survive his detox.



By day four, Adam felt like dying. His clothes were drenched and he reeked of sour body odor. He knew how quickly a hit would ease his discomfort, but he was too old for this, he had to change once and for all. 

‚ÄúJust another week or two,‚Äù he assured himself. ‚ÄúAnd it‚Äôd all be water under the bridge. Just another week or two‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúOld Man, come get some fresh air,‚Äù Nubz spoke quietly. He was a soft spoken young man whose expression rarely showed anything but sorrow. 

Adam winced at the intrusion, but the kid was right. He rolled forward and reached out his hand to Nubz for support to stand. Nubz obeyed, stretching forward what was left of his hand. Adam frowned looking at the limb: only a scarred lump remained. He then looked at Nubz‚Äô face and gestured the boy‚Äôs hand away, standing on his own with a groan. Nubz led Adam to the den just beyond the congregate shelter where Virgil sat against a wall, smiling dumbly into the brisk night. 

Adam‚Äôs voice and body protested the effort to sit on the ground. He placed himself beside Virgil, and Nubz joined quietly too. They passed brief introductions. 

Virgil, a chubby man roughly the same age as Adam, saw Nubz as a son. Nubz had joined the streets a few years prior after losing his entire family to a tragic accident, the light in his eyes snuffed with the passing of his dear sister and mother. His fingers followed with frostbite. Much like Adam, Virgil had tried sobriety, succeeded, and relapsed, and partly that was out of fear for Nubz. He didn‚Äôt want the kid to be alone again. So Nubz and Virgil wandered the streets together, inebriated or high depending on the day, each other serving as the closest thing to family that either would ever have again.

Nubz pawed at the plastic lid of some shit liquor, struggling to twist the cap without fingers. 

‚ÄúGive it here, kid,‚Äù Virgil demanded half teasing, half complaining at Nubz‚Äô speed, or lack thereof. Virgil spun the cap like a top, sending it bouncing across the ground before he took a generous swig and laughed, his honking humor sounding like a clown‚Äôs toy horn. Nubz smiled silently with a closed mouth, eyes brightening slightly. Adam was observing, trying not to draw attention to his weakened and sickly state. He clasped his hands tightly together in his lap. 

‚ÄúThey‚Äôll give you clean clothes if you ask, haha‚Äù Virgil laughed.

Virgil fished clumsily in his pocket, revealing a filthy bubble and a lighter. He struck the lighter a few times before it finally sustained a flame and he held it to the browned, glass pipe. Tendrils of smoke started to slither from the narrow chamber and he inhaled deeply, relishing the false warmth it brought and ignoring its bite in his lungs. He nonchalantly held the object to Adam. 

‚ÄúNo, no.‚Äù Adam stoutly declined, nervously looking to Virgil and then to Nubz and then to his potential exit. In the distance he noticed a tall figure.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs shit dope. Weak.‚Äù Virgil reassured. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll take the edge off those shakes, wean you off like you‚Äôre supposed to. Ha.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. I‚Äôve-‚Äù Adam stammered, looking back at his exit. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve done this before, cold turkey is best for me.‚Äù

‚ÄúRelax, pen-day-ho, HA HA‚Äù Virgil teased, exaggerating the pronunciation to make light that Adam was a minority amongst minorities, and he broke into a loud, honking laughter. Nubz joining him. 

Adam smiled and cautiously took the bubble, rolling the bulbous end between his fingers. He too struggled to light it, but eventually the flame took and the noxious wisps of smoke began to form as the dark sludge boiled. He held it to his mouth and inhaled deeply, when he noticed that the tall man was closer and his details somewhat apparent. 

His face was long and drooping, his hair unkempt, and he moved in small, rigid motions. He looked wet. His skin clung to him like cling wrap. Adam wanted to protest the sight, but he felt his body relax with the familiar invite of his fix. He watched the tall, sagging man cock his head inquisitively towards them as if studying them. Virgil‚Äôs laugh overpowered every other sound in the blissful haze, and soon Adam paid no more attention.



The hangover the next morning was worse. Adam wasn‚Äôt surprised. He knew better. It always bit harder when it returned if you faltered. He watched steam billow off his nearly translucent coffee. It had been diluted by staff to stretch the pot. He wrapped his bony fingers around the white paper cup and frowned knowing that the shakes had returned, but if he focused he could still calm them briefly. 

He wasn‚Äôt the only one staring blankly in the cafeteria. Staff played the only available DVD, and a few vacant, dirty faces watched the flatly narrated nature documentary about insects. A fat caterpillar, swollen with the larva of a parasitic wasp visible beneath its flesh uneventfully crawled across a branch, and Adam‚Äôs stomach churned at the thought. He gagged briefly, overtaken by lightheadedness and he flinched, splashing the hot fluid across his lap. 

He stumbled to the bathroom, and staff provided him with a dry, clean pair of pants. Inside, he clutched the sink trying to get a grip on himself. The shakes were getting worse rapidly and his want for a fix was too. ‚ÄúJust another week or two,‚Äù he thought, and cupped water into his hands, watching ripples form as his muscles twitched beyond his control. He held the water on his face, letting it wash across him with his eyes closed. 

When he opened his eyes, the tall figure stood in the threshold of the open maintenance closet in the men‚Äôs restroom. It was normally secured and locked, but it was open this time and Adam hadn‚Äôt initially noticed. He spun around, revealing the now empty maw of the closet and took a few steps closer. He clenched his fist, adrenaline masking his previous pallor. The incandescent bulb couldn‚Äôt penetrate the windowless chamber of that small, dank place. Like a curtain, the shadows ceased at the door itself, and Adam listened to the echoing of his heart and errant, leaky plumbing. He willed himself another step forward, pupils wide, and the stench of ammonia and rancid water grew stronger. There was something in there, he could hear it squelching in the shadows just below an audible sound and he could feel its wet, glossy eyes watching him back. Something predatory in the murk with a droning grumble like endless, battering waves.

The bathroom door swung open, ‚ÄúPendejo! Haha!‚Äù Virgil honked. 

Adam clutched his chest in a panic and rolled his eyes to see Virgil, briefly glancing back to the closet. The sense of dread he previously felt had lifted, and he chocked it up to withdrawals.

‚ÄúVirgil,‚Äù Adam started, never smiling in return, ‚Äúwho‚Äôs dealing out here?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, uh, ha‚Ä¶ ha.‚Äù Virgil‚Äôs voice was laced with nervousness. He may have partaken in the garbage himself from time to time, but he never liked to see anyone else actually need it. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôd be Peter. His girls usually push it for him, don‚Äôt often deal directly with him. He‚Äôs the only one with something still, ever since the pigs doubled down.‚Äù He spoke solemnly. ‚ÄúAdam‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs a dangerous man.‚Äù 



The rain finally let up, but it hadn‚Äôt stopped completely, steadily falling in lazy drops now. The ground was saturated and the puddles overflowed. Every low pocket in the earth was full and the asphalt glistened like dark ice. 

Adam threw his hood over his face and hung his head low, trotting in the puddles while he loathed his worn out sneakers in the dampness. A man swayed beside a boarded shop as Adam approached. He fought gravity, unaware of Adam‚Äôs presence, and quickly lost to the force of physics. He rolled in a deep puddle, splashing Adam as he fell. Adam cursed the man under his breath. 

The man thrashed in the puddle. It was particularly deep in the neglected side walk. He couldn‚Äôt right himself and choked, pulling mouthfuls of water into his lungs and triggering a heavy coughing fit that evolved to gagging, and, eventually, he emptied the contents of his stomach into the puddle, still fighting not to drown in his blitzed state. Chunks of pasta and desiccated tomato skins floated in the still, oily water as he fell face first again into the puddle, exhausted and surrendering. Adam grabbed the man by his collar and pulled him back, wincing to see his pinpoint pupils in his drifting eyes. This could be his future, he thought. He shoved the man against the store front and rolled his head back to ease his breathing. He‚Äôd be fine.

In the eaves of a convenience store next to the abandoned shop, a young Philippino woman watched the ordeal. She wore a skirt too short to be practical with thick makeup, dreading the rain ruining her mask. Her legs were marked in goosebumps in the chill. Beneath the cheap foundation and hastily applied eye liner, her face was thick with sorrow. She was easily young enough to be Adam‚Äôs kid.

‚ÄúMost would have let him drown. How brave of you.‚Äù She smirked as he approached her.

‚ÄúMy place is just around the corner-‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Adam interrupted. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want you. I just want a fix.‚Äù

‚ÄúFine,‚Äù she hissed as her expression changed to a scowl. She pulled her phone from under her breast, her red fingernails briefly clacking on the screen as she typed. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôll be right here. I don‚Äôt have any today. Go over there.‚Äù She gestured to the other side of the store‚Äôs exterior.

Adam sauntered quietly over to the proud structural beam and tucked his head down, waiting seemingly for ages. Every person that walked their way, he looked to the girl and she shook her head no. But eventually, a white man in a worn hoodie, blue jeans, and tacky cowboy boots slowly strolled towards them. Adam glanced towards her and her silent nervousness affirmed his unasked question. 

Peter wasn‚Äôt anything elaborate. Hidden beneath the baggy garment he hid lean, average muscles and a mess of sun-born freckles. His hair was slightly thinning, and he hadn‚Äôt shaved today. He wore a polite, disarming expression that only cracked when he knew he had the upper hand or if you knew to look for the malice hidden in the corner of his eyes and the dilation of his pupils. He had savagely hungry eyes, but to the untrained observer he could dull their spark on a whim. He hid in plain sight.  

The Philippino woman kept her head low and her chest open, hoping the submissive, flirty posture would disarm his unpredictable power. Adam couldn‚Äôt hear them speak, but even from a distance he could see something had gone wrong. Peter‚Äôs posture changed and he grabbed her arm with a purposeful jab, pulling her to the alley. Adam waited until they rounded the corner before he followed.

‚ÄúWho the fuck is that?‚Äù Peter hissed.

‚ÄúA client,‚Äù she stammered, ‚Äúhe wanted-‚Äù

Before she could finish Peter rose his hand and struck her hard across the face with his knuckles, knocking her to the ground. ‚ÄúYou dumb bitch, the pigs are too hot right now. I told you this. What did I say? WHAT DID I SAY?‚Äù He said, grabbing her and swinging her into the wall.

‚ÄúNo one knew! No one new‚Ä¶‚Äù She panted, a small line of blood forming on her lip. 

‚ÄúChignon, ease up on her.‚Äù Adam interrupted. ‚ÄúI just want some dope. Listen, if I was a rat would I shake this bad?‚Äù He held hands in front of him while his limbs trembled.

‚ÄúWho the fuck are you?‚Äù Peter dropped the woman and turned to face him.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm an old addict,‚Äù he moved his hands to gesture peace, ‚ÄúI just want a fix-‚Äù before he could finish stars erupted in his gaze as Peter threw a firm punch into his face. Crimson erupted from Adam‚Äôs nose. He tried to crawl away, but Peter‚Äôs hooked kick knocked the wind out of Adam‚Äôs lungst. Adam desperately tried to reach the exposure of the open street rather than the secrets of the alley in his stunned state.

Adam crawled away like a dog while Peter relaxed his posture, circling his prey. Adam thought how, once upon a time, he would have given a man like Peter a run for his money. Before Adam could react again to his approaching threat, Peter placed his foot firmly between Adam‚Äôs shoulder blades and brought Adam flat to the earth, plunging him into the puddle of detritus, oil, and vomit. Adam jerked his face to the side and sputtered, gasping to clear the water from his airway, but Peter grabbed him by his hair and drove his face into the water again. 

Adam thought for a fleeting moment how undignified it was to drown in vomit, but how much worse that fate felt when he knew it wasn‚Äôt his own. His mind wondered if he felt something brush against his cheek, a piece of hastily chewed and partially digested food floating in the puddle. ‚ÄúOld thugs,‚Äù Adam thought as his vision grew dark, remembering his father‚Äôs warning and loathing his own legacy now.

But before Adam lost consciousness, Peter pulled him out of the water, throwing him on his back at the feet of the snoring man nearby. Adam gasped and choked, desperate for air. But in one, final insult to the old man, Peter again brought down his foot, plunging the heel of his thick boot with all his force into Adam‚Äôs hip with a crunch, and fracturing the sweeping arch of Adam‚Äôs pelvis. Adam shrieked. Peter breathed heavily for a moment and smiled, readjusting his pants when he heard sirens in the distance. The sky opened up again, washing the freshly flowing blood from Adam‚Äôs nose.

The woman had fled and the store had locked its doors in response to the fight. But Adam heard slowly plodding footsteps above the rain. He warily blinked his eyes open, half expecting to see Peter there ready to finish the job. Instead, there stood a tall man with a drooping face and a rancid left eye. His other eye was cold and distant, his body as soaked as if he had also been rolling in the putrid puddle himself. He moved his head back and forth in curiosity, in observation, twitching briefly like a cat‚Äôs skin before pouncing. With an open palm, the tall man reached for Adam, wrapping his long fingers around Adam‚Äôs ankle and pulled, dragging him towards the alley. Adam kicked weakly and cursed, and the man hissed. A PD cruiser rounded the corner, and the man released Adam, quietly disappearing into the wet alley as quickly as he had appeared and Adam‚Äôs vision faded.



Andrea helped walk an old woman into the ER. ‚ÄúShe probably needs sutures,‚Äù she spoke factually to the nurse, reaching for a warmed blanket for the frail soul beside her. 

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll get her patched up and let her warm up a while,‚Äù the nurse assured. 

She was ready to leave when she caught the familiar face in a neglected corner of the wing.

‚ÄúAdam,‚Äù she spoke inquisitively, ‚Äúyou practically just got here.‚Äù 

He exhaled a weak chortle.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the damage?‚Äù

‚ÄúAside from the obvious?‚Äù He retorted, opening his less swollen eye to see her. ‚ÄúBroken hip.""

‚ÄúGod, I‚Äôm so sorry, Adam. How is your pain? I wouldn‚Äôt judge you if that set you back.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, no, I refused. They gave me ‚Äòsuper ibuprofen,‚Äô that‚Äôs how they described it. It isn‚Äôt doing shit.‚Äù

She nodded, frowning to imagine his suffering but proud to hear he stood resolute. It had taken a scare on his life, but he would beat it this time. ‚ÄúWho did this to you?‚Äù

‚ÄúVirgil says his name is Peter.‚Äù He winced.

Andrea scrunched her lips and nodded, unsurprised. ‚ÄúAre you pressing charges?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the point?‚Äù He whimpered.

She nodded slowly again. She was silent.

‚ÄúAndrea,‚Äù Adam‚Äôs voice switched rapidly to urgency with her name and back to contemplation. ‚ÄúWhen I was a boy, my papa told me about the men in the desert. You didn‚Äôt cross them. If you pissed them off, they‚Äôd hack your head off with a rusty lawnmower blade, make a message out of you. If you were lucky, they‚Äôd use a machete instead. But they were men with an agenda. You could buy them off. You could take their side.‚Äù He paused to rest, wincing at the pain. Adam opened his good eye as wide as he could, terrified, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs something out there that you can‚Äôt buy off.‚Äù 



Sepsis - March 30 to October 23

Harvey swayed. He stood at the top of a knoll, exposed, watching the earliest summer tourists move below and around him in the small park in the heart of the city. Flickering consciousness rolled in and out of his mind. There wasn‚Äôt much left to him, not that there ever was in the first place. Moments of lucidity flashed behind his eyes as neurons progressively died and a thick tendril of drool hung dumbly from his gaping mouth. To any tourist, he was just another tweaker out of his mind.

‚ÄúGive me some,‚Äù Phyllis demanded like a toddler, as she always did. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got some good stuff on you, I can tell.‚Äù She laughed at Harvey and his apparent stupor.

Harvey didn‚Äôt respond beyond the growing length of slimy saliva on his chin.

‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt seen you in a while,‚Äù Phyllis spoke anxiously. She reached to touch him.

Harvey finally stirred, reacting with a violent spasm and his eyes and face twitched. Phyllis frowned, unsure what to say or do to his peculiar actions. She‚Äôd seen him tweak, but never like this. 

Harvey‚Äôs pupil dilated in his good eye and the dead, left eye remained milky and rotting. He scoped her from head to toe. She felt uncomfortable under his gaze. He felt predatory. 

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs in it for me?‚Äù Harvey sneered. 

Phyllis‚Äô expression flooded with sorrow. She was getting tired of using her body as a bargaining chip. ‚ÄúYou know‚Ä¶ I could‚Ä¶‚Äù she stammered, ‚ÄúI could suck-‚Äú

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Harvey interrupted her, and the tendril of spit swung wildly. He eyed her keenly as he sharply inhaled. ‚ÄúMore.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Yeah‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs fine.‚Äù She spoke solemnly and dropped her eyes to his feet. 

Harvey nodded, patting his pocket to confirm if the foil and needle he‚Äôd felt earlier were still there. He didn‚Äôt remember placing them there, but he had felt them earlier and had enough consciousness still to bargain. 

His memories never felt like his own anymore, and each day he felt progressively detached. It wasn‚Äôt the haze of drugs or alcohol, he hadn‚Äôt touched either in days, no longer bound by their vices. But it was similar. He‚Äôd been sober, against his will but without protest, to the best of his failing mind since his last clear memory, his drugs still in his pocket since then.

Some days after Laura had died, when he was still banished from the congregate shelter for his previous antics, he slept quietly and drunkenly between bins of rancid trash and debris a few blocks away. The last thing he could scantly remember was choking, gagging, and gasping for air, as if he had vomited in his sleep. He dreamed of some large, wet animal crawling its way down his throat and nestling in his belly. A grotesque mongrel with bare skin, fibrous muscle exposed.

But with each passing day his phantom confusion chipped away more and more at his cognizance and he felt increasingly like a husk. Even his eye throbbed less despite its worsening state. Every day: a blur, and even less of a concern now as he stood on the knoll. Now he was only hungry, distant, and foreign in his own flesh. No food could satiate him, and he lustfully eyed bodies with warm wombs. 

Phyllis dutifully pulled him by his arm a few blocks over, down where the street dropped to a gully and the alders were thick enough to provide cover. Trash littered the trampled earth, this was a regular haunt out of the public eye. She pawed at his belt, thinking, what need did he have for a belt when he never bothered to latch it? And she frowned to see his skin. He was always dirty and gaunt, but presently his skin looked so tired and sagged so unnaturally over his bones, like flesh that had given up or was beginning to slough from a saturated corpse‚Ä¶ like melting wax. She shimmied her hips from her cotton leggings and he descended upon her with equal ferocity and purpose. And when they were done, he handed her the drugs and staggered off, leaving her confused why he didn‚Äôt stick around to share. 

Harvey - rather, what was once Harvey - learned how to get more of the drug. And Phyllis grew more enthused to continue their transaction because he never took some for himself. He even regularly came back with good shit, stuff that only Peter would offer her on rare occasion. She didn‚Äôt bother to question how, and quickly didn‚Äôt care how sickly Harvey looked, ignoring the faint smell of decay that seemed to follow him. She was high, and between Peter and Harvey she‚Äôd choose Harvey a hundred times over. 

Time passed and the ritual repeated nearly daily, but one day Harvey abruptly vanished again. Phyllis picked at her skin, anxious for her high when she couldn‚Äôt find him. She surprised herself, however, with how long she endured before she finally sought out Peter. A few days at least, burning through the stash she collected from Harvey. And Peter feigned his sympathy when she ultimately returned to him.



Phyllis vomited her meager meal into the shelter‚Äôs toilet. She was still spitting bitter acid from her mouth into the bowl when another woman banged on the stall, demanding that Phyllis hurry. Phyllis ignored the raspy voice‚Äôs impatience, waiting impatiently herself for the off brand pregnancy test to finish. Peter had cut her supply recently, and she hoped her nausea could be answered by that. 

She dry heaved now, gagging further at the sight and smell of the yellow-brown bile she spat into the water. She wiped her eyes and nose, wet with forced tears and snot, and glanced down at her knees where the test rested. Two lines had appeared. She understood quickly what that meant, and she bellowed deeply on the dingy bathroom tile. Once again, the smoker‚Äôs voice barked for her to hurry up and now to shut up. 

By June, Phyllis had been relocated to a different shelter for pregnant women and those with children. She‚Äôd been there before, but she was angry this time. She resented the whores that shared that space with her, especially those that bounced their newborn infants on their knees, whispering quietly in hushed, babbling joy to their babies that their housing had been approved. They‚Äôd relapse too, she thought spitefully to herself, they‚Äôd be in her shoes soon enough.

By mid summer, Phylis was informed she was carrying twins. The nurses and other staff pleaded with her to stop drinking if she was going to continue the pregnancy. The worry always fell on deaf ears. By September, her OBGYN halfheartedly warned her that one of her babies was significantly smaller than the other. ‚ÄúA complication of drinking as much as you do,‚Äù she sighed, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre killing them,‚Äù she sneered. It wasn‚Äôt professional, but it was true. Phyllis didn‚Äôt care. By October, she was swollen with her offspring. She begged Peter for something, anything, but he scowled at her in disgust. ‚ÄúWho would want your dirty ass? You did this to yourself.‚Äù He laughed, flicking a cigarette butt at her. 

By October 23, Phyllis was numb. She scored enough pocket change to stumble into a liquor store, and the 22-year-old cashier stared in mixed disbelief and disgust as he rang up her purchase of cheap vodka. The double-headed eagle on the logo poised in prideful triumph: her vice would always win. 

With the bottle mostly finished, she sat against the only cover she could find under the loading bay of the modern City Hall. She wailed her mournful cries in the dark while fat raindrops fell around her. Black puddles sparkled in sickly gold from nearby lights with each ripple that disturbed them. She took the last gulp and howled, casting the plastic bottle into the night and it skittered across the wet asphalt.

A small man shambled up to her and plopped next to her, drawing his shoulders in with the cold. ‚ÄúGot anymore?‚Äù He smiled under his wiry mustache. 

Phyllis staggered to her feet, splaying them wide to sure her stance, ‚Äúget away from me!‚Äù She screamed, kicking at him. 

He shoved her, cursing, ‚Äúfuck off, psycho bitch!‚Äù

She stumbled once or twice and spun before she fell on her protruding belly. She shrieked and moaned, rolling uncomfortably on the ground. The man stared wide eyed, frantically scanning around him, and broke into an uncoordinated sprint to flee his fault.

She crawled back to the wall, clutching her large stomach. Her vision swirled and a sudden, intense agony rushed her. She could feel them move. She remembered, from the past, what it felt like to feel her baby kick, but this felt more like something trying to escape. Pain bit through her abdomen in searing waves.

She bit her lip between grunts and screams. Sweat covered her and she felt lightheaded. She pushed, and a slurry of blood and mucus poured from her groin. She felt a lump between her legs, granting her some relief with its sudden presence. She pulled the front of her pants down and fumbled, grabbing the warm mass with deliberate harshness. Fear heavy on her face, she cradled the premature infant in her palms. It‚Äôs skin was a delicate red and everything about it was fragile. It never cried. 

Reality struck her as if the dead infant she held was now too hot to hold, and she frantically dropped it. Panting, she cried for help to the night, but the second time she called, the pain returned tenfold. She winced and pulled her freshly bloodied hoodie up and over her belly and breasts in a panic. The white of her eyes flashed against her face as she watched her abdomen writhe and stretch. The urge to push overtook her and she groaned. 

Phyllis groped at the walls as if she was futilely trying to escape her own body. Even in her drunken and wounded state, she realized she couldn‚Äôt crawl away from something inside of her. She pushed as the contractions worsened. Laying flat, she arched her hips up and pulled her soiled pants off her legs, pushing herself away with her wriggling belly pointed to the night sky. 

She pushed again, and this time more bloodied fluid erupted from her, splattering and spraying the ground. Another push: a membranous sac squeezed out of her gravid body with a sickening squelch. Phyllis wept, desperately clinging to consciousness as she spent the last of her energy to crawl using her arms. She rolled away from whatever she expelled from her body, and she laid on her side, whimpering.

The sac abruptly shivered after prolonged stillness. It shook harder and more erratically and stretched until it tore. Phyllis‚Äô shallow breaths raced as she watched it, but she desperately rolled once again as she pulled herself through a puddle to escape. Gritty water and bodily fluids mixed to a slurry on the street.

A fetal hand emerged from the membrane. Slowly, the infant slithered from its cocoon and rested. Phyllis couldn‚Äôt see it clearly, but its flesh seemed to warp and settle in the darkness. It gasped suddenly, choking on the thick slime that clung to its face and it cried for attention and in frustration while Phyllis continued to put steady distance between it and herself. She trailed blood behind her.

Adrenaline coursed through her and she felt acutely sobered. She pushed herself up to look when she could no longer hear the infant‚Äôs cries and instead heard a wet patter across the ground. She sobbed when she turned to face her baby, now perching on narrow, stilted legs and observing her keenly with unnaturally wide set eyes. Its umbilical cord hung from its mouth and its neck bulged. It swallowed hard, the lump in its throat sliding down to its pudgy belly and slurped its afterbirth. 

It chirped at her affectionately, stretching its neck to explore her before placing a clawed foot against her chest and shoving her to the ground. She wept quietly as it began to suckle. It greedily sucked milk when she reached out and slapped its face with a forceful blow. It fell back and kicked wildly on its back until it righted itself and growled. Its face split diagonally from the top of its head down its throat, revealing a wretched mouth full of thick, curved teeth. And finally it ran towards her, hungry for blood instead.",2,1757922730.0,creepcast,1,1.0,False

**The Setup:**  
Clube de Regatas Brasil (CRB) hosts Amazonas FC in a S√©rie B clash where the underdogs (Amazonas) are about as likely to win as my chance of remembering to water my plants. CRB, fresh off five days of training and a full roster, is favored to the tune of **-0.75 goals on the spread** (odds: -111) and **1.62 decimal odds to win outright** (implied probability: \~61.7%). Amazonas? They‚Äôre priced at **5.75** (17.4% implied) to pull off the upset‚Äîabout the same chance as me napping without my coffee.

**Key Stats:**

* CRB has 34 points (10W-4D-11L), sitting just outside the top 6. A win here could rocket them to 7th.
* Amazonas trails with 29 points (8W-5D-12L), stuck in the muck of mediocrity.
* The \*\*over/under is 2.25 goals

Hey everyone! üôè

I‚Äôm working on setting up a Discord server called Kolkata Adda ‚Äì a chill space where Kolkatans can meet, chat, share memes, plan pandal hopping, talk about food, or just vibe together during Pujo and beyond.

Right now, the server is still under development, and I‚Äôd love to make it more than just another group chat. For that, I‚Äôm looking for:

Server Creator/Builder ‚Üí someone experienced in Discord setups (channels, roles, bots, etc.) to help design the base.

Mods ‚Üí to help manage channels and keep things fun & safe.

Creators ‚Üí people who can bring ideas, memes, reels, contests, or even organize virtual addas.

Early members ‚Üí who want to help shape the server culture from day one.


If you‚Äôve ever wanted to be part of building an online community for Kolkatans (and Pujo lovers in general), this is the perfect chance! üéâ

Drop a comment or DM if you‚Äôre interested, and I‚Äôll share the invite link. üöÄ

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Why is this happening and how do I pace it?,"26M in NYC here. I made a Hinge last week and I‚Äôm honestly overwhelmed (not a humblebrag, just looking for advice).

In 7 days I‚Äôve gotten a lot more attention than I expected. Roughly:
	
‚Ä¢	Day 1: ~10 matches, Day 2: ~20, Day 3: ~30‚Äì50, and then ~10‚Äì30/day after that.
	
‚Ä¢	About 194 matches total this week.
	
‚Ä¢	42 people shared their numbers, 5 prefer to keep chatting on the app, 4 shared IG, 1 shared Snapchat.
	
‚Ä¢	I‚Äôve been clearing the ‚ÄúLikes You‚Äù tab daily. Each day I get 10-30 likes.
	
‚Ä¢	The one thing I‚Äôm doing differently vs past tries is sending a message with every like.

This is very different from my experience on Tinder/Bumble/older Hinge attempts, so I‚Äôm trying to understand what‚Äôs going on and how to handle it respectfully.

Questions:
	
1.	Why the surge? Is this likely a ‚Äúnew profile‚Äù boost, something about NYC, my messaging-with-like habit, or something else about the algorithm?
	
2.	How do I pace this without burning out? If multiple people want to meet, what‚Äôs a reasonable number of dates per week so I don‚Äôt flake or get exhausted?
	
3.	How do I keep interest without overpromising? Is it okay to say, ‚ÄúMy week‚Äôs packed, but I‚Äôd love to grab coffee next week ‚Äî does Tues/Wed work?‚Äù Or should I offer a short phone/video chat first to keep momentum?
	
4.	Any good scripts/templates for politely spacing things out (e.g., letting someone know I‚Äôm interested but can‚Äôt meet for ~1‚Äì2 weeks), without sounding dismissive?

I‚Äôm not trying to waste anyone‚Äôs time. I want to be upfront, considerate, and realistic about my bandwidth while still meeting people I click with. Any insights on the algorithm side, pacing strategies, or communication tips would be super helpful. Thank you!

EDIT 1: Formatting was messed up.

TL;DR: 26M in NYC. New Hinge profile, ~194 matches in 7 days after sending a message with every like. Overwhelmed. Why might this be happening (new profile boost?

I met someone in January and we fell in love very fast and unexpectedly. She already had plans to move several states away to pursue her masters degree at the end of the summer but the relationship felt so perfect we decide to continue on anyway. After 6 truly amazing months together, the end of July comes and I help her move in and so starts the long distance part of the story. Neither of us were adjusting well. She was having issues getting a new job, leaving her friends and developing a social life in her new state and I became very depressed and unsure if long distance would work out ( i realize now I was just in my head too much about not having them around). Ik there's no justification and I take full accountability for my actions, but I cheated on them with my ex. I waited about 6 days before I broke down and told them.I immediately stopped all of my bad habits, started therapy and got us both workbook/ journals for the situation. After a week of talking about it we broke up. I would love to have a second chance and I really feel I can prove I'm worth it. She says she's not sure she can forgive me for cheating and wouldn't want to continue a relationship and hold it over me forever Her solution to figure this out is to go no contact until a day in the winter (Nov/Dec) where we get coffee. I have no idea if we'll get back together or not until that day. All I feel I can do now is continue to work on myself and try to get over the relationship I used to have.

 I want to make some chocolate cakes for my Sisters birthday tomorrow. I wanted to go with the much recommended method of adding some coffee to the cake to enhance the cocoa chocolate taste. However in trying to compare recipes I noticed something. All the recipes that add coffee use oil instead of creamed butter. Why is that? Will it be bad to try and force it?

 I found this because I had bought ingredients for a basic chocolate cake recipe that had no wet ingredients outside of eggs and a splash of milk and I was trying to work out how to adapt it. Is there something about creamed butter that does not work with much liquid?

1nhexlp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1nhexlp/roommate_horror_story/,Roommate horror story,"My roommate got a subleaser for the last month and a half of our lease. I was gone for the summer, so when I came back she had already moved in, and both of my roommates had already moved out. My roommates warned me that she was not great, but little did I know what was in store for me‚Ä¶

When I arrived home, almost everything of mine in the apartment was gone (except for what was in my room). All my toiletries, decorations, everything. I asked her about it, and she said she had hidden all my stuff away because she didn‚Äôt know I was coming back, and that my roommate who subleased to her told her she‚Äôd be living alone. That was a blatant lie. The posting she responded to said she‚Äôd be living with two other girls, and both of my roommates had told her multiple times that I was coming back, even giving her the exact date a week before. I brushed it off, but during that conversation I realized something else about her.

She does not let anyone else speak. Like, at all. She would ask me questions and then immediately interrupt or talk over me before I could answer. I have never met someone I was absolutely unable to have a conversation with. The first couple of days I tried, even reminding her to ‚Äúplease let me speak‚Äù multiple times every conversation, but she was just incapable of it. I‚Äôd never experienced anything like it. She also made me uncomfortable multiple times, going into detail about her masturbation habits and ranting about how much she hated my other roommate (who had only lived with her for three days). I told her again and again I was uncomfortable and wanted to switch topics, but she wouldn‚Äôt. By the third day I gave up trying to converse with her at all. That didn‚Äôt stop her from talking at me constantly.

Oh, and did I mention she‚Äôs 40 years old (we‚Äôre all in our mid-twenties) and studying to be a therapist? That was when I developed a real fear for her future patients.

She also completely filled up the fridge, and it smelled so bad I honestly worried there was a rotting body in there. I had to hold my breath every time I went into the kitchen. I asked her politely to clean out whatever was rotting‚Äîfour separate times‚Äîand every time she got incredibly defensive. She was completely incapable of taking feedback and probably one of the least self-aware people I‚Äôve ever met. She‚Äôd get super mad at me for making any noise past 8 p.m. when she went to bed, but then grind coffee beans and vacuum outside my door at 5 a.m. when she knew I was sleeping. Things like that happened constantly.

She was also rude, naive, and condescending. One time she told me‚Äîaggressively and completely unprovoked‚Äîthat in her ‚Äúprofessional opinion‚Äù I needed to get a therapist to help me cope with the miserable life I must have since I ‚Äúfelt the need to do drugs.‚Äù This was after she saw me smoke weed once. She even said she thought I overdosed. I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs ever seen a high person before, and she had never even seen a bong. Whenever I lent her something and later asked for it back, she would insist it had always been hers‚Äîbasically stealing from me. But she was impossible to argue with because I couldn‚Äôt even get a word in. And honestly, this is only the tip of the iceberg.

A few hours after I moved out, she sent me a super rude and unprovoked text. I really want to send one back and tell her exactly what I think of her. I held my tongue through every single interaction we had, and I‚Äôm dying to let loose. But my parents think I should wait until she‚Äôs moved out in case she tries to retaliate against our security deposit. They also think the higher road is to just say nothing.

Here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm conflicted: she‚Äôs 40 years old, has no money, no job, no marriage, no kids, and no friends (that I know of). Maybe without me saying anything she‚Äôs already suffering. But I also genuinely worry about her becoming a practicing therapist. She‚Äôs already a volunteer counselor for dementia patients and also volunteers as a child and family therapist for low-income families. That terrifies me. I‚Äôve had bad therapists before (though never anywhere near this bad), and I always wished someone had intervened before they got licensed.

I felt completely overwhelmed by her, and I‚Äôm not even a vulnerable person like a kid, a dementia patient, or a future client. Part of me thinks the best thing I can do is take the high road and not respond to her, but still reach out to her school and volunteer organizations to warn them. I wouldn‚Äôt lie or exaggerate‚Äîjust share what happened and let them decide what to do. That way, I don‚Äôt stoop to her level, but I still address what feels like a serious concern.

Sorry this was so long. Should I text her my grievances? Warn her school and volunteer organizations? Do absolutely nothing? Am I completely overreacting? What would you do?",1,1757919622.0,Advice,4,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

She works as a biomedical engineer in a sterile lab environment, which kinda makes sense with her personality. But honestly, her cleanliness goes to another level. She keeps her toothbrush sealed in a plastic bag in a drawer, showers at least twice a day, and her apartment looks like it‚Äôs straight out of a magazine. Even her car looks like it‚Äôs never been sat in. She‚Äôs basically the human version of a UV sanitizer.



I‚Äôm not a slob‚ÄîI do my dishes, take out the trash, and my place is generally tidy. But Chloe‚Äôs standard of clean is‚Ä¶ intense. We‚Äôve been talking more about our future lately, and that‚Äôs where things got complicated.



Chloe really wants kids. Like, brings-up-baby-names-over-coffee wants kids. And I want them too. But she‚Äôs never really been around young children. She seems to think we can raise a kid and still maintain her standard of immaculate cleanliness. She literally told me once, ‚ÄúIf you teach them early, they‚Äôll respect their environment.‚Äù



Now, I‚Äôm the oldest of five and helped raise half my cousins. I‚Äôve changed diapers, been thrown up on, cleaned melted crayon off walls‚Äîyou name it. Kids are amazing, but they‚Äôre also messy. Like, ‚Äúwhy-is-there-apple-sauce-in-your-hair‚Äù messy.



So I tried to gently explain to her that kids come with messes‚Äîlike, a lot of them. I brought up blowout diapers, toddler art projects on the furniture, food flung across the room, mysterious sticky spots‚Ä¶ you get it. Her response? ‚ÄúThat only happens when parents don‚Äôt set clear boundaries.‚Äù



I told her it‚Äôs not about bad parenting‚Äîit‚Äôs about kids being kids. They spill things. They touch stuff. They‚Äôre learning how to exist in the world, and sometimes that means tracking mud all over the floor or painting the dog with yogurt.



She got upset and said I wasn‚Äôt supporting her vision of motherhood and accused me of using ‚Äúhypothetical messes‚Äù as an excuse to avoid having kids. Now we‚Äôre stuck in this argument where she thinks I‚Äôm not taking her side, and I‚Äôm wondering if maybe I‚Äôm being too pessimistic. Maybe some people really do manage to raise kids in spotless homes? But that hasn‚Äôt been my experience.

1nheqng,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicforretail/comments/1nheqng/each_to_their_own_music_in_retail_environments/,Each to their own! music in retail environments,"Music in retail is a powerful tool used to shape the customer experience, influence their behavior, and reinforce a brand's identity. The music chosen for a store depends on a variety of factors, including the type of retailer, the target demographic, and the desired atmosphere.



# Luxury Retail: The Sound of Exclusivity



In luxury retail, the goal is to create a refined, unhurried, and exclusive atmosphere. The music is an essential element of this, designed to make customers feel comfortable and to encourage them to take their time browsing.

* **Classical and Instrumental:**¬†Music such as classical piano, string quartets, or instrumental jazz is a common choice. It projects an image of sophistication, quality, and timeless elegance. Research has shown that classical music can even influence customers to perceive products as being more expensive, potentially leading them to make higher-value purchases.
* **Ambient and Nu-Jazz:**¬†For more contemporary luxury brands, downtempo electronic, ambient, and nu-jazz genres are popular. These styles are cool, modern, and non-intrusive, creating a sleek, refined soundscape that complements high-end fashion or technology.



# Fashion and Apparel: A Reflection of the Brand



Fashion retailers use music as a direct extension of their brand's identity. The playlist is carefully curated to appeal to the target demographic and to create an energetic, stimulating, or laid-back vibe, depending on the store's style.

* **Upbeat Pop and Indie Rock:**¬†For fast-fashion or trendy boutiques, upbeat pop and indie rock are common. The high tempo creates a lively atmosphere that encourages quick browsing and impulse purchases.
* **Hip-Hop and R&B:**¬†Urban streetwear or youth-focused brands often use hip-hop and R&B to build a cool, edgy, and culturally relevant atmosphere that resonates with their target audience.
* **Acoustic and Folk:**¬†Bohemian or casual fashion brands may opt for acoustic and folk music. This creates a relaxed, comfortable, and inviting atmosphere, encouraging customers to browse leisurely.



# Grocery and Department Stores: The Soundtrack of Shopping



For large-scale retailers like grocery and department stores, music is used to control the flow and pace of shoppers. The music is generally a broad mix of genres designed to be universally inoffensive and subtly influential.

* **Adult Contemporary and Classic Hits:**¬†The most popular choice, as it appeals to a wide range of ages. Familiar, upbeat, and often nostalgic songs are used to create a cheerful and pleasant atmosphere.
* **Pop and Soft Rock:**¬†Music with a moderate tempo is often preferred to encourage a steady, unhurried shopping pace. A slower tempo can increase ""dwell time""‚Äîthe amount of time a customer spends in a store‚Äîwhich often leads to higher spending.
* **Seasonal Playlists:**¬†These stores also heavily use seasonal music, such as holiday songs in December, to create a festive mood and encourage gift-buying.



# Bookstores and Caf√©s: The Sound of Calm



Bookstores and the cafes within them prioritize creating a calm, relaxing, and intellectual environment. The music is meant to encourage customers to slow down, browse, and stay a while.

* **Jazz and Classical Piano:**¬†These genres are excellent for a quiet, contemplative atmosphere. They fill the silence without being a distraction, allowing customers to focus on reading or working.
* **Acoustic and Ambient:**¬†Gentle, instrumental, and lo-fi music is a popular choice for its ability to create a cozy and calm soundscape. It's the perfect backdrop for browsing bookshelves or enjoying a coffee.



# Convenience Stores: The Sound of Speed



In convenience stores, the musical strategy is the opposite of fine dining or bookstores. The goal is to facilitate quick, efficient purchases.

* **Upbeat, Familiar Pop:**¬†The music in a convenience store is often upbeat and easily recognizable. The fast tempo is designed to match the desired speed of customer turnover. It keeps the energy high and encourages customers to make their purchases and move on quickly.



# The Business of Music Licensing in Retail



Regardless of the type of retailer, it is a¬†**legal requirement**¬†to have a proper license to play music in a commercial space. A personal subscription to a streaming service like Spotify or Apple Music is for personal use only and does not cover public performance. In the UK,¬†**TheMusicLicence**¬†from¬†**PPL PRS Ltd**¬†is the standard for covering both public performance and broadcasting rights. The cost is determined by factors like the size of the store and the type of music usage. Playing unlicensed music can result in significant fines and legal penalties, making it a critical aspect of retail operations.",1,1757918885.0,musicforretail,0,1.0,False
1nheqkl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1nheqkl/moved_to_a_new_country_feel_completely_alone_cant/,"Moved to a new country, feel completely alone, can't seem to get a win. Getting older as a woman really makes you feel invisible.","My husband and I moved to a foreign country about three years ago because I got a great job offer in an industry that is practically dead in our home country. I do not regret the move because financially, it was definitely the right decision for us--however, I've really been struggling with the social aspect of it. I've been feeling really depressed lately and just can't seem to get a win.  
  
In our home town (which was a big metropolitan city), I wasn't the biggest social animal, but I reliably had multiple groups of friends I could hit up to spend time with when I felt the urge to go out. My industry was small and niche, which meant everyone knew everyone, and I was respected for the work I had been known to do. I went to college in this city, built my entire adult life in this city... and I guess I really took that for granted.

I didn't feel super lonely the first year we moved. We were having lots of adventures, exploring our new country, dealing with immigration... Then, last year, I had a bit of a falling out with my main formal friend group over a political stance (relating to feminism) I *thought* we all had in common. Suddenly, it hit me how alone I really was in this new country; the messages in the group chat with old friends across the globe had given me enough of an illusion of a social life that wasn't really true. My job is also completely remote and for a pretty small company, and while my industry is doing better here than in my home country, it's still quite isolated, so it's not easy to find people to connect and find each other.

Instead of wallowing around, I've been trying my absolute hardest to push myself out of my comfort zone and meet new people in this city. It's a much smaller city, and I have somewhat ""unconventional"" interests for my age/gender demographic (or at least, it seems like I do considering how hard it's been to find other people like me to talk to). I'm a woman in my early 30s who's *really* into retro gaming, film (especially older films) and anime, but also care a lot about feminism, story/film theory and critical conversations around art, which... makes finding community very difficult, even online.  

I've attended multiple ""meetup"" events surrounding various interests and either end up in situations where I am the only woman, or the majority of the attendees are 10 years younger than me, or the vibes are generally just not what I'm looking for.

I attended one today that I thought was a perfect match. It was a meetup for playing social deduction board games, which I had never played before. I had a *really* great time, thought I connected with the group, we all laughed and even played an extra round over our scheduled time because we didn't want to stop! I left feeling really good about what happened and super eager to attend the next game, and we even discussed as a group hosting it at my place the next time instead of the local coffee shop because it was super close by and there'd be more room. One of the members even grabbed my email to invite me to his place the next time he hosted a board game night! 

A few hours after I get home, I get a message from the group leader saying that they don't think my ""play style"" is a right match for the group and I wouldn't be welcomed back. I was completely flabbergasted by this, because I was under *no* impression whatsoever that I was causing any trouble to the group at *all*, and in fact got the opposite impression! I've been picking apart my behavior basically line by line, trying to understand where I went wrong, and the only thing I can think of is that *possibly* I was too enthusiastic? I got too ""into"" the game? But other people were being really loud and passionate too, and I thought I was just matching the energy... 

I try not to make things gendered arbitrarily, but I couldn't help but to feel like it kind of was in this case. Besides me, only two other women were in the game, and they both had slightly 'meeker"" play styles, in that they didn't really speak until spoken to. This worked out really well for one of them when they got an evil role, so definitely a valid strategy! The rest of the group was made up of 7 men, the majority of whom largely dominated the conversation--to the point where it was often hard to get a word in over them. My first two games, I was given ""investigation"" roles, which meant I had a lot of information, so I was trying to convey this information to my teammates and gather more of it where I could. I was basically following the lead of the men in the group; trying to be proactive, trying to help solve the mysteries, and engaging in playful competitiveness when appropriate. Multiple times in my life, I've been told (as an insult) my personality is ""assertive,"" ""masculine"" and ""unfeminine."" Maybe it's unrelated, but it really felt like being singled out in this way reiterated these insults I have received over my life, when I was just mirroring the way the majority of the other (male) players were playing.  
  
And so, I've just been crying all night because I just feel like... kind of at the end of my rope in regards to trying to build a new social life here, online or in person. I wonder sometimes if I were still a 20 year old, or if I were just a man instead, if it would be easier for me. My husband has had such an easy time finding and making friends here (he's into video games, Warhammer, DnD, and has had no issue finding peers in his age group to hang out with). It makes me feel like something is inherently wrong with me, and I just am starting to feel hopeless. I don't feel like I can find community online, and I'm also too mortified to try going to anymore ""meetup"" type things lest an embarrassment like today happen again... so what else is there left for me to do?",3,1757918876.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

I know TDS doesn‚Äôt tell the whole story of flavor, but I‚Äôve heard that with today‚Äôs higher-quality coffees, people are often aiming for higher TDS than in the past. That made me wonder what the modern ‚Äúbaseline‚Äù is.

Traditionally, SCA suggested 1.15‚Äì1.35% as the ideal range for drip/pourover. But obviously it depends on brew ratio, grind, and technique:
	‚Ä¢	Larger brew ratio ‚Üí lower TDS (more diluted)
	‚Ä¢	Smaller brew ratio ‚Üí higher TDS (stronger cup)

Roast degree complicates things, too:
	‚Ä¢	Darker roasts: fewer solubles overall, but they extract more easily
	‚Ä¢	Lighter roasts: more potential solubles, but harder to extract

So my questions are:
üëâ Do darker roasts usually end up with higher TDS in practice?
üëâ Or do people typically adjust dose for darker roasts to keep things balanced?

And more broadly, what ranges are you aiming for these days with high-quality light roasts?

‚ú® I‚Äôd also love it if as many people as possible could share their current brew parameters and target TDS ‚Äî would be great to see the variety of approaches!",1,1757918055.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

Espresso lovers know the rich, bold flavor is unmatched. But not everyone has an espresso machine at home. The good news? You don‚Äôt need one to enjoy a strong, delicious espresso. With a few simple tools and some patience, you can brew a cup that rivals any caf√©.

This guide will show you how to do it right. Get ready to impress yourself and your friends with your homemade espresso skills. Let‚Äôs dive into the process and make some great coffee!

# Espresso Basics

Espresso is a strong and concentrated coffee enjoyed by many around the world. Making espresso at home without a machine can be challenging but is possible. Understanding the basics of espresso is crucial before diving into the process. This guide will help you learn what espresso is and the key ingredients needed to make a perfect cup.

# What Is Espresso?

Espresso is a type of coffee brewed by forcing a small amount of nearly boiling water through finely-ground coffee beans. It is known for its rich flavor and thick consistency. It is the base for many popular coffee drinks like lattes, cappuccinos, and macchiatos.

**Key characteristics of espresso include:**

* **Strong flavor:**¬†Espresso has a more intense flavor compared to regular coffee.
* **Small serving size:**¬†Typically served in small quantities, usually 1-2 ounces.
* **Crema:**¬†A golden layer of foam on top, indicating a well-made espresso.
* **Quick brewing time:**¬†Takes about 25-30 seconds to brew.

Espresso is enjoyed by itself or as a base for other drinks. Knowing these characteristics helps you understand what makes espresso unique and why it is loved by coffee enthusiasts.

# Key Ingredients

Making espresso requires just a few ingredients, but each plays a vital role in achieving the perfect cup. The primary ingredients include:

* **Coffee beans:**¬†Use high-quality, dark roast coffee beans. Freshly ground beans are essential for the best flavor.
* **Water:**¬†Use filtered water to avoid impurities that can affect the taste.

**Details on the ingredients:**

|Ingredient|Description|
|:-|:-|
|Coffee Beans|Choose a dark roast for a rich, bold flavor. Grind them just before brewing.|
|Water|Filtered water enhances the taste and quality of the espresso.|

Aside from the primary ingredients, you might need some additional tools like a grinder, kettle, and a method to apply pressure to the coffee grounds. These tools help replicate the pressure and temperature needed for a good espresso.

# Essential Equipment

Making espresso without a machine might seem challenging, but with the right tools, it‚Äôs quite achievable. Having the essential equipment can make all the difference in brewing a perfect cup of espresso. This guide will help you understand what you need to get started.

# Manual Methods

For those who prefer a hands-on approach, there are several manual methods to make espresso. Each method requires specific equipment and a bit of practice, but the results can be just as satisfying as using a machine.

Here are some popular manual methods:

* **Aeropress:**¬†This versatile tool can make a strong, espresso-like coffee. You will need an Aeropress, coffee beans, grinder, and hot water. Simply grind your coffee beans to a fine consistency, place the Aeropress over a mug, add the coffee, pour hot water, and press down slowly.
* **Moka Pot:**¬†Also known as a stovetop espresso maker, the Moka Pot uses steam pressure to brew coffee. You need a Moka Pot, finely ground coffee, and a heat source. Fill the bottom chamber with water, add coffee to the filter basket, assemble the pot, and heat it on the stove until coffee starts to fill the top chamber.
* **French Press:**¬†While not traditional for espresso, the French Press can make a concentrated coffee if used correctly. Use a French Press, coffee beans, grinder, and hot water. Grind the coffee beans finely, add them to the French Press, pour hot water, stir, and steep for about 4 minutes before pressing down the plunger.

These manual methods require attention to detail and patience. Practice makes perfect, and soon you‚Äôll enjoy a rich, homemade espresso.

# Alternative Tools

Beyond manual methods, several alternative tools can help you make espresso without a machine. These tools are often more portable and affordable, making them great options for coffee enthusiasts on a budget.

Consider these alternative tools:

* **Handheld Espresso Makers:**¬†These devices are compact and easy to use. They require ground coffee, hot water, and manual pressure. Examples include the Wacaco Nanopresso and STARESSO.
* **Espresso Pods:**¬†Some brands offer espresso pods that can be used without a machine. These pods contain pre-ground coffee and can be steeped in hot water for a quick espresso-like drink.
* **Manual Lever Machines:**¬†These machines use a lever to create pressure for brewing espresso. They are more traditional and require some skill, but they can produce excellent results. Popular models include the Flair Espresso Maker and the Rok EspressoGC.

Each of these tools has its advantages and can suit different preferences and lifestyles. Whether you‚Äôre camping, traveling, or just don‚Äôt want to invest in a full espresso machine, these alternatives offer a practical solution for making espresso at home.

# Grinding Coffee

Making espresso without a machine might seem challenging, but with the right technique, you can enjoy a rich, flavorful shot at home. One of the most critical steps in this process is grinding your coffee. The grind size and the type of grinder you use can significantly impact the taste and quality of your espresso. Let‚Äôs delve into the importance of grind size and the recommended grinders for making espresso.

# Importance Of Grind Size

The grind size is crucial when making espresso. It affects the extraction rate and the flavor profile of your coffee. A fine grind is necessary for espresso because it increases the surface area of the coffee, allowing for a quicker and more efficient extraction.

Here are some reasons why grind size is important:

* **Extraction Time:**¬†A fine grind allows water to pass through the coffee grounds more slowly, ensuring a proper extraction time of about 25-30 seconds.
* **Flavor Balance:**¬†The correct grind size helps in achieving a balanced flavor. Too coarse, and your espresso will taste weak and under-extracted. Too fine, and it can be bitter and over-extracted.
* **Consistency:**¬†Consistent grind size ensures that each particle extracts at the same rate, providing a uniform taste.

A simple way to test your grind size is by examining the coffee puck after brewing. A well-extracted puck should be even and slightly firm.

# Recommended Grinders

Choosing the right grinder is essential for achieving the perfect grind size. Here are some recommended grinders for making espresso without a machine:

1. **Burr Grinders:**¬†These grinders are preferred for espresso because they provide a consistent grind size. Burr grinders crush the beans between two abrasive surfaces, which can be adjusted to achieve the desired fineness.
   * **Manual Burr Grinder:**¬†Affordable and portable. Great for beginners.
   * **Electric Burr Grinder:**¬†Offers convenience and consistency. Ideal for regular use.
2. **Blade Grinders:**¬†These grinders use a rotating blade to chop the beans. They are less expensive but can produce an uneven grind.
   * **Electric Blade Grinder:**¬†Quick and easy. Best for those on a budget.

Here‚Äôs a comparison table to help you choose:

|Grinder Type|Pros|Cons|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Manual Burr Grinder|Affordable, Portable, Consistent|Time-consuming, Manual Effort Required|
|Electric Burr Grinder|Consistent, Convenient, Adjustable|Expensive, Requires Electricity|
|Electric Blade Grinder|Quick, Affordable|Inconsistent, Uneven Grind|

Investing in a good grinder can make a significant difference in the quality of your homemade espresso. Choose one that fits your budget and meets your needs.

# Brewing Techniques

Making espresso without a machine may seem challenging, but there are simple and effective brewing techniques that can deliver a rich, flavorful shot of espresso. Whether you‚Äôre a coffee enthusiast or just curious, these methods can help you enjoy a delightful cup of espresso with minimal equipment. Let‚Äôs explore two popular techniques: the Stovetop Moka Pot and the French Press Method.

# Stovetop Moka Pot

The Stovetop Moka Pot is a classic method for brewing espresso-like coffee at home. It‚Äôs a three-chambered pot that uses steam pressure to brew coffee. Here‚Äôs how to use it:

* **Step 1:**¬†Fill the bottom chamber with water up to the safety valve.
* **Step 2:**¬†Insert the filter basket and fill it with finely ground coffee. Do not tamp the coffee; just level it off.
* **Step 3:**¬†Assemble the Moka Pot by screwing the top and bottom chambers together.
* **Step 4:**¬†Place the Moka Pot on medium heat.
* **Step 5:**¬†Wait for the coffee to start bubbling up into the top chamber. This should take about 5-10 minutes.
* **Step 6:**¬†Once you hear a hissing sound, remove the pot from the heat to avoid over-extraction.

The resulting coffee will be strong and concentrated, similar to espresso. The Moka Pot is a favorite due to its simplicity and the rich flavor it produces.

# French Press Method

The French Press is another versatile tool that can be used to make espresso-like coffee. Though it‚Äôs traditionally used for regular coffee, with a few adjustments, you can achieve a strong, espresso-style brew.

* **Step 1:**¬†Heat water to just below boiling, around 200¬∞F (93¬∞C).
* **Step 2:**¬†Grind your coffee beans to a fine consistency. Use about 2 tablespoons of coffee per 4 ounces of water.
* **Step 3:**¬†Add the ground coffee to the French Press.
* **Step 4:**¬†Pour the hot water over the coffee grounds, ensuring all grounds are saturated.
* **Step 5:**¬†Stir the mixture gently to ensure even extraction.
* **Step 6:**¬†Place the lid on the French Press with the plunger pulled up.
* **Step 7:**¬†Let the coffee steep for about 4 minutes.
* **Step 8:**¬†Slowly press the plunger down to separate the grounds from the brewed coffee.

The French Press method yields a robust and full-bodied coffee that mimics espresso. It‚Äôs a great alternative if you don‚Äôt have a Moka Pot or espresso machine.

# Water Quality

Making espresso without a machine might seem challenging, but it is possible with the right techniques. One key aspect is the quality of the water you use. Good water can make a significant difference in the taste of your espresso. Let‚Äôs dive into the details.

# Choosing The Right Water

Choosing the right water for your espresso is crucial.¬†**Water quality can affect the flavor and aroma**¬†of your coffee. Here are some tips to ensure you use the best water:

* **Filtered Water**: Use water that has been filtered to remove impurities. This helps in avoiding any off-flavors.
* **Mineral Content**: Water with too many minerals can make your espresso taste bitter. Use water with moderate mineral content for the best results.
* **Avoid Distilled Water**: Distilled water lacks minerals which are necessary for extracting the flavors from coffee grounds.

To help you understand better, here‚Äôs a simple table showing the ideal mineral content for espresso water:

|Mineral|Ideal Range (mg/L)|
|:-|:-|
|Calcium|17-85|
|Magnesium|4-30|
|Sodium|10|

**pH Level**: The pH level of water should be neutral, around 7. Water that is too acidic or too alkaline can affect the extraction process.

By using the right water, you ensure that your espresso is rich and flavorful.

# Temperature Considerations

The temperature of the water is another vital factor.¬†**Water temperature affects how well the coffee grounds are extracted**. Here‚Äôs what you need to know:

* **Ideal Temperature**: The best temperature for brewing espresso is between 195¬∞F and 205¬∞F (90¬∞C to 96¬∞C).
* **Consistency**: Keep the temperature consistent to ensure uniform extraction.
* **Boiling Water**: Avoid using boiling water (212¬∞F or 100¬∞C). It can scald the coffee grounds, leading to a burnt taste.

Here‚Äôs a quick guide for checking water temperature:

1. Boil the water and let it sit for 30 seconds to cool down slightly.
2. Use a thermometer to check the temperature. Aim for the ideal range.
3. Adjust as needed to maintain consistency.

Maintaining the right temperature helps in achieving a balanced and smooth espresso.¬†**Too hot or too cold water can lead to poor extraction**.

Remember, great espresso starts with great water. Focus on these factors, and you will notice a significant improvement in your homemade espresso.

# Extracting Espresso

Making espresso without a machine might seem challenging, but it‚Äôs possible with the right techniques. Extracting espresso involves creating pressure and timing the brew perfectly. Let‚Äôs explore these methods to make a rich and flavorful espresso at home.

# Pressure Techniques

Creating the right pressure is essential for extracting espresso. Without a machine, you can use alternative methods to achieve the desired pressure. Here are a few effective techniques:

* **Aeropress:**¬†This tool uses manual pressure to force hot water through the coffee grounds. Place a filter in the Aeropress cap, add coffee grounds, pour hot water, and press down slowly.
* **Moka Pot:**¬†Known as a stovetop espresso maker, the Moka Pot uses steam pressure. Fill the bottom chamber with water, add coffee grounds in the filter basket, and heat until the top chamber fills with coffee.
* **French Press:**¬†Though not traditional, a French Press can mimic espresso. Use fine grounds, pour hot water, stir, and press down the plunger slowly.

Each method has its unique approach to creating pressure. It‚Äôs crucial to use fine coffee grounds and hot water to ensure a strong brew. Experiment with these techniques to find the one that suits your taste.

# Timing The Brew

Timing is critical in making a good espresso. The extraction process should be controlled to avoid over or under-extraction. Here‚Äôs how to time your brew:

1. **Heating:**¬†Preheat your tools, including the cup, to maintain the temperature. This step ensures even extraction.
2. **Pouring:**¬†When using an Aeropress, pour hot water slowly over the grounds. For a Moka Pot, wait until the water boils and starts moving through the coffee.
3. **Extraction Time:**¬†Aim for a total extraction time of 25-30 seconds. This timing is crucial for a balanced flavor. Start your timer as soon as you begin pouring hot water.
4. **Finishing:**¬†Stop the process immediately when the time is up. Over-extraction can make your espresso bitter.

By controlling the timing, you can extract the best flavors from your coffee grounds. Practice makes perfect, so keep adjusting your timing until you achieve the ideal taste.

# Tasting Notes

Espresso is a beloved beverage, known for its rich, concentrated flavor. Making espresso without a machine may seem daunting, but it is possible. Understanding the tasting notes is essential to mastering this technique. Tasting notes help identify the unique flavors and aromas in your homemade espresso.

# Flavor Profile

Homemade espresso can vary in flavor. The key is to balance the various elements. Let‚Äôs break down the flavor profile of a well-made espresso:

* **Bitterness:**¬†A slight bitterness is expected, but it should not overpower. It comes from the coffee beans‚Äô natural oils.
* **Sweetness:**¬†Good espresso has a natural sweetness. It balances the bitterness and acidity.
* **Acidity:**¬†Acidity adds a bright and tangy note. It should be crisp, not sour.
* **Body:**¬†The body is the mouthfeel of the espresso. A full-bodied espresso feels rich and creamy on the tongue.

These elements create a complex and enjoyable cup. To achieve the best flavor profile, consider these tips:

1. **Use fresh, high-quality beans:**¬†Freshly roasted beans yield better flavors.
2. **Grind consistency:**¬†A fine, uniform grind is crucial for extracting the right flavors.
3. **Water temperature:**¬†Ideal water temperature is between 195¬∞F and 205¬∞F (90¬∞C to 96¬∞C).
4. **Brew time:**¬†Aim for a brew time of around 25-30 seconds.

Paying attention to these factors helps create a balanced and flavorful espresso.

# Common Mistakes

Many beginners make mistakes when making espresso without a machine. Here are some common errors and how to avoid them:

* **Using stale beans:**¬†Stale beans produce a flat and dull taste. Always use fresh beans.
* **Incorrect grind size:**¬†Too coarse or too fine a grind can ruin the extraction. Stick to a fine, consistent grind.
* **Improper tamping:**¬†Uneven tamping leads to uneven extraction. Apply even pressure when tamping the grounds.
* **Wrong water temperature:**¬†Water that‚Äôs too hot or too cold affects the flavor. Keep it between 195¬∞F and 205¬∞F (90¬∞C to 96¬∞C).
* **Over-extraction:**¬†Brewing for too long makes the espresso bitter. Keep the brew time within 25-30 seconds.

These mistakes are easy to make, but they are also easy to correct. Here is a quick reference table for common mistakes and solutions:

|Mistake|Solution|
|:-|:-|
|Stale beans|Use freshly roasted beans|
|Incorrect grind size|Grind to a fine, consistent size|
|Improper tamping|Tamp evenly with consistent pressure|
|Wrong water temperature|Use water between 195¬∞F and 205¬∞F (90¬∞C to 96¬∞C)|
|Over-extraction|Limit brew time to 25-30 seconds|

Being mindful of these common mistakes helps improve the quality of your homemade espresso. Paying attention to detail ensures a better-tasting cup every time.

1nhed5y,https://i.redd.it/lde0azz1v9pf1.png,Has anyone read Her Pregnancy Trap? I just found it.,"Chapter 1 Over dinner, I was scrolling through X when a post stopped me cold.

\[I‚Äôm pregnant and want my best friend‚Äôs husband to take responsibility as the dad. What should I do?\]

I was about to type that the poster was out of her mind, but the replies were worse.

\[It‚Äôs easy. If you‚Äôre close with the couple, just invite them on a trip.\]

\[Get them drunk at night, then ‚Äòaccidentally‚Äô end up in her husband‚Äôs room. Boom, done.\]

\[Afterward, show him a positive test and pressure him to step up and claim the baby‚Ä¶\]

I let out a disbelieving laugh, heat prickling under my skin. I was about to send the post to my best friend so we could roast it when Sarah looked up from her plate.

‚ÄúHey, Lily, you free this weekend?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúHow about a trip?‚Äù

I froze.

‚ÄúA trip?‚Äù I raised a brow. ‚ÄúWhere did that come from? Isn‚Äôt a weekend kind of rushed?‚Äù

Sarah and I had been friends since college. We usually planned trips over long breaks; this was out of the blue, and two days barely covered the travel time.

She grinned like it was nothing. ‚ÄúI was just scrolling X and saw there‚Äôs an EDM festival in Las Vegas this weekend. Come on, Lily‚Äîwe haven‚Äôt had fun in forever. Work‚Äôs been grinding us down. Let‚Äôs blow off some steam.‚Äù

I hesitated, nudging my food around. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ Let me think it over tonight,‚Äù I said after a beat. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have plans this weekend, but I promised Ethan I‚Äôd run things by him. He gets anxious if I don‚Äôt.‚Äù

At the mention of my husband, Sarah‚Äôs eyes lit for a split second. Then she flashed a bright smile. ‚ÄúEasy fix‚Äîbring Ethan. It‚Äôll be even safer with him there.‚Äù

Before I could answer, she pulled out her phone and opened Ticketmaster.

Unease slid under my ribs. A trip. The three of us. The timing. It looked a little too much like that post.

I watched Sarah tapping away, her face bright with excitement. A wild thought flickered: What if she was the one who posted it?

I shook my head at myself. No way. The world wasn‚Äôt that small. We‚Äôd been friends for five years. I knew her. She wouldn‚Äôt do something like that.

I took a breath, talked myself down, and told her to go ahead and buy the tickets.

A minute later, Sarah excused herself to the bathroom. As she stood, a waiter carrying a tray came up beside her. She didn‚Äôt see him, and they collided.

My heart stopped for a beat.

Sarah‚Äôs hands flew to her belly, shielding it on instinct.

A chill raced over my skin.

Was Sarah‚Ä¶ pregnant?

Was she really the one who wrote that post?

Chapter 2 As soon as Sarah slipped away to the bathroom, I seized the chance to open the post I‚Äôd been reading. The original poster had updated it only seconds earlier.

\[Score ‚Äî I got her to agree! I told her to bring her husband, and she didn‚Äôt hesitate to say yes. Lucky we were so close‚Äîshe didn‚Äôt suspect a thing. \]

My stomach dropped.

I scrolled down and saw a handful of new replies. After Sarah‚Äôs comment, the people who had been quietly following the thread finally spoke up. Several jumped in and tore into her.

‚Äú\[ou‚Äôre supposed to be her friend, and you‚Äôre scheming like this? Are you even human?\]

\[Running into someone like you is the worst luck. I hope your friend sees this and learns who you really are. Gross.\]

\[Don‚Äôt push this kind of trash my way again ‚Äî I‚Äôm so mad I‚Äôm going to get an ulcer! Dumbass!\]

But the poster didn‚Äôt flinch; she shot back at every critic.

\[You weren‚Äôt in my shoes. If you were, you‚Äôd have done the same thing.\]

\[I just can‚Äôt stand it. Why should some small-town nobody get to marry a city guy? She‚Äôs not as pretty as me, her family isn‚Äôt as good as mine‚Äîhow is she worthy of her husband?\]

\[Anyway, I‚Äôm going to ruin her. If I can‚Äôt have what I want, she doesn‚Äôt get to live happily either. I can‚Äôt wait to see her face when her husband betrays her.\]

\[Haha, it‚Äôll be epic. She‚Äôll end up alone and unwanted.\]

The more I read, the colder the room felt. There was no denying it‚Äîthis poster was Sarah.

She had said it herself: I‚Äôd come from a small town. I was the only kid from my hometown who‚Äôd made it to college.

That background had left me feeling inferior through university; I‚Äôd kept to myself and didn‚Äôt have many friends.

Sarah had been the one who reached out‚Äîthe one who stuck with me through freshman year, through graduation, and into these early years at work. I‚Äôd trusted her more than anyone.

I hadn‚Äôt expected her to be capable of something so dark. That she could look down on me and want to destroy my happiness‚Äîknowing all that‚Äîfelt like a punch to the ribs.

My hands began to tremble around the phone.

Sarah stopped replying to the commenters. I realized she might be coming back.

I shoved the phone into my pocket, drew a slow breath, and smoothed my expression until it was neutral. I‚Äôd made up my mind. I wasn‚Äôt just going to decline her weekend invitation‚ÄîI was done with her. For good.

She returned from the bathroom and slid back into her seat across from me, smiling.

‚ÄúLily, I already bought your ticket. I just need your husband‚Äôs email for his e-ticket and I‚Äôll buy his now. Don‚Äôt worry about the cost ‚Äî I‚Äôve got it covered. Consider it my treat for you two coming with me.‚Äù

Her smile was bright. To me, it looked like a challenge, sharp at the edges.

I swallowed the anger bubbling beneath my ribs and forced my voice calm. ‚ÄúSarah, you should refund the ticket. I‚Äôm not going.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Her voice shot up before I could finish, loud enough that a few heads turned. She coughed and softened it immediately. ‚ÄúI mean‚Ä¶ what? You‚Äôre bailing now? That‚Äôs so sudden.‚Äù

I put on an apologetic look.

‚ÄúSorry, I thought about it. The timing‚Äôs tight, and I‚Äôve got a huge project that‚Äôs piling up ‚Äî I‚Äôll probably need to work through the weekend. Let‚Äôs plan a paid vacation later, when things settle down. For now, maybe find someone else to go with.‚Äù

Her smile dropped. Irritation slipped over her face. ‚ÄúBut we already agreed. I bought the ticket, Lily. You can‚Äôt just back out now‚Äîthat‚Äôs unfair.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care,‚Äù she added quickly, like a petulant command. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre coming with me this weekend, no excuses.‚Äù

In the past, whenever Sarah sulked or threw a fit, I had always been the one to give in.

If she wanted something, I found a way to make it happen; she was my best friend, after all. Now, knowing what I knew, I felt foolish for five years.

I forced a bitter little smile and kept eating, eyes on my plate.

Sarah fidgeted, anxious at my silence. She opened her mouth to say more, but I grabbed a napkin, wiped my lips, and stood up before she could speak.

‚ÄúSorry, Sarah, it‚Äôs getting late. My husband‚Äôs waiting for me. I have to go.‚Äù I offered a conciliatory smile. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll make it up to you next time.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt wait for her response. I turned and walked out‚Äîquick, deliberate steps‚Äîand I didn‚Äôt look back at her expression.

When I got home and opened X, a notification popped up: Sarah had posted again.

Chapter 3 I stared at my phone, thumb hovering, as Sarah‚Äôs latest post blew up with comments.

She‚Äôd posted that she‚Äôd backed out and was begging for help ‚Äî the kind of panicked post that begged attention.

Underneath the flood of replies, one commenter stood out: the same person who‚Äôd given advice earlier.

The person asked, bluntly, whether Sarah really needed her best friend to step in this time. Couldn‚Äôt she find someone else?

Sarah‚Äôs answer landed like a blow. She wrote that there was no way ‚Äî she was going to steal her friend‚Äôs husband.

She said she wanted to ruin her happiness.

She went on: at lunch that day the woman had kept bringing up her husband, and it had made Sarah sick. She wanted to see her cry, to watch her break.

My stomach turned. Whatever thin strand of affection I‚Äôd still had for my so-called best friend snapped in that instant.

Then the commenter went quiet. A minute later I noticed they‚Äôd taken the thread to private messages.

After my shower I checked Sarah‚Äôs post again. Her tone had flipped to smug. \[It‚Äôs done,\] she‚Äôd written. \[I got her. I‚Äôll bring good news to you all this weekend.\]

Confusion prickled at me ‚Äî had she switched targets?

Before I could sort it out, my phone started buzzing. A dozen Messenger notifications from Ethan. I‚Äôd been so wrapped up in Sarah‚Äôs feed that I hadn‚Äôt noticed.

I opened the chat. He‚Äôd sent a screenshot with a string of messages: \[Babe, what‚Äôs going on? Why‚Äôs Sarah asking me for my email?\]

\[She said you wanted to go to the EDM festival ‚Äî is that true? You didn‚Äôt reply and she kept harassing me, so I gave it to her.\]

‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

I felt cold. Sarah had gone around me and messaged Ethan directly ‚Äî and she‚Äôd lied. I was furious.

I was about to call him and demand answers when I heard the front door open. Ethan was home.

I didn‚Äôt try to hide it. ‚ÄúWhy would you agree to anything she said without checking with me first?‚Äù I asked in the living room.

He looked surprised and a little wounded. ‚ÄúYou always trusted her, didn‚Äôt you?‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúSometimes it feels like you two are the couple, not us. You always take her side. She was blowing up my phone and you weren‚Äôt answering, so I figured it was okay.‚Äù

His words stung, but they weren‚Äôt wrong.

For five years I‚Äôd trusted Sarah blindly. When we traveled she‚Äôd set the budget and I‚Äôd Venmo her without question. At work, if she wanted a project I‚Äôd give it up without complaint just to keep the peace.

Thinking back on all those small concessions, I felt my stomach churn again ‚Äî maybe my blind trust had made her feel she could do anything.

I told Ethan everything: the post, the hateful things she‚Äôd written, that she seemed intent on destroying us.

His face darkened with each detail. Without hesitation he pulled out his phone and blocked Sarah in front of me.

‚ÄúIf it wasn‚Äôt for you, I wouldn‚Äôt even have her contact,‚Äù he said, jaw tight.

‚ÄúTell her the festival‚Äôs off. I‚Äôm done with her. And you‚Ä¶‚Äù His gaze softened but stayed firm. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve seen who she really is now. Stay away from her. No more contact.‚Äù

I nodded. My resolve hardened.

I opened my messages to Sarah and sent a short, final reply: \[I wasn‚Äôt going.\]

She answered immediately, slipping into her usual act.

\[Lily, please,\] she wrote. \[I‚Äôm desperate. I can‚Äôt go alone. I just wanted Ethan to talk you into coming ‚Äî the three of us would have fun. I couldn‚Äôt find anyone else. Come on, have a heart.\]

I scoffed, my patience gone. I blocked her back.

The next morning at work, my boss, Luke Connor called everyone together and announced, casually, ‚ÄúHeads up ‚Äî we have a team-building retreat this Friday and Saturday.‚Äù

Chapter 4 At first, I didn‚Äôt think much of it. Last week Luke had mentioned a company team-building outing. I just hadn‚Äôt expected it to fall on Friday and Saturday of the same week.

When Luke briefly described the destination, he flashed a grin. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to a resort this time,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be teamed up with another department for the activities.‚Äù

He chuckled. ‚ÄúThe company doesn‚Äôt have an explicit policy forbidding office romances, so if you‚Äôve got your eye on someone in another department, this is a good chance to mix and meet.‚Äù

Then he looked at me. ‚ÄúLily, you‚Äôre lucky ‚Äî you can go with your husband and take a company-paid trip.‚Äù

His words made me frown. I couldn‚Äôt help glancing at Sarah Mitchell, my so-called best friend. She was already looking back. In that instant our eyes locked and I saw a flash of smug satisfaction, as if she‚Äôd just pulled off some elaborate scheme.

No way. Could she have had something to do with pairing my husband‚Äôs department with ours?

After Luke finished and everyone returned to their desks, I opened the thread I hadn‚Äôt checked in a couple of days. Nearly five hundred new comments had been posted.

I scrolled through them, my anger building with every line. People were offering advice.

\[If they‚Äôre not willing to go, find a way to make them have to,\] one commenter said.

Another wrote, \[Tell us more about your situation and I‚Äôll help you come up with a plan.\]

Sarah had laid out the details.

\[We work in the same company and same department,\] she wrote. \[Her husband is in a different department. The company is planning a team-building event ‚Äî could that be my chance?\]

The thread exploded. \[Yes! Absolutely!\] someone answered. \[Team-building is perfect. Everyone will know if you hook up ‚Äî how could he not take responsibility after that?\]

\[But team-building is so random,\] Sarah worried in the thread. \[There will be tons of people and departments ‚Äî I might not even get a chance to talk to him‚Ä¶\]

\[Don‚Äôt be dense,\] another commenter shot back. \[Team-building events are organized by someone. Find out who‚Äôs in charge of arranging groups and cozy up to them. See if you can get put in the same group.\]

To break the ice, the company randomly pairs two departments to form a team each time, competing against other departments in team vs. team games during corporate events.

I kept scrolling until I hit Sarah‚Äôs follow-ups.

\[Thanks, babes!\] she wrote. \[I tracked down the HR person organizing the event and brought her a coffee. I said there was someone I liked in that department and asked if she could pair us together ‚Äî she said yes!\]

A moment later she added, \[Plan is moving along. Just got word ‚Äî I‚Äôm in the same group as her husband‚Äôs department! Wait for my good news, everyone!\]

Sarah was humming a cheerful tune across the room, completely oblivious to the storm boiling inside me. A cold fury settled over me.

I stood up and marched to Luke‚Äôs office. ‚ÄúLuke,‚Äù I said, forcing my voice steady, ‚Äúcan I skip this team-building event?‚Äù

Chapter 5 Luke shot down my request without hesitation. He even sent a announcement stressing that everyone had to attend the team-building retreat unless they had a valid reason.

With no other choice, I reluctantly agreed.

On Friday morning, we left the office. Once we arrived at the retreat, everyone headed straight to the hotel to check into their rooms. Ethan and I were assigned to the same room.

After dropping off our luggage, I stepped out and almost ran into Sarah Mitchell.

She was standing outside my door, fixated on the room number. The moment she noticed me, she quickly looked away, then brightened and grabbed my hand.

‚ÄúLily, are you still mad at me?‚Äù she pouted playfully. ‚ÄúI messed up, okay? Can you forgive me?‚Äù

Ever since I‚Äôd blocked her, Sarah had been clinging to me at work, constantly trying to smooth things over. The second we got off the bus today, she‚Äôd rushed over, apologizing nonstop.

If I didn‚Äôt soften, I worried she‚Äôd start sensing something was off.

So I turned my head, pretending to still be upset. ‚ÄúSo you finally admit you were wrong?‚Äù

Seeing me soften, Sarah seized the moment. ‚ÄúI swear I didn‚Äôt mean it! I just really wanted to go.‚Äù

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt push you anymore,‚Äù she added quickly. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt want to, that‚Äôs fine.‚Äù

I sighed heavily, pretending to give in reluctantly. ‚ÄúFine. But there better not be a next time.‚Äù

Sarah nodded eagerly, her face lighting up.

Then came her real agenda.

She leaned in closer, her voice soft and almost pitiful.

‚ÄúSince you‚Äôve forgiven me, Lily‚Ä¶ can we sleep in the same room tonight? I‚Äôve never been good at sleeping alone, and you barely talked to me these past few days. Just keep me company, okay?‚Äù

Her grip on my arm was gentle but persuasive.

But my mind was elsewhere, replaying the post I‚Äôd just seen. Earlier in the room, I‚Äôd opened the app and noticed Sarah had posted an update:

\[Just arrived at the retreat! What should I do next? Any advice?\]

Some creep online had replied:

\[Is your bestie sharing a room with her husband? If so, find an excuse to get her to sleep with you instead.\]

\[That way, you can separate them. Get everyone drunk tonight, and when no one‚Äôs paying attention, sneak into her husband‚Äôs room. That‚Äôll do the trick. After that, it‚Äôs all up to you!\]

Sarah had eagerly liked the comment and even promised a cash reward if the plan worked.

Sure enough, not long after, she appeared at my door‚Äîfirst softening me with apologies, then moving straight to her scheme.

Meeting her pleading gaze, a sudden idea sparked in my mind. If Sarah was willing to throw away our friendship and ruin my happiness, I‚Äôd make her taste regret herself.

I kept my expression calm, though inside I was smirking. I placed my hand over hers and patted it lightly. ‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù I said softly. ‚ÄúWe can sleep in the same room tonight.‚Äù

‚ÄúReally?!‚Äù Sarah‚Äôs eyes lit up. She hadn‚Äôt expected such an easy agreement.

She chattered excitedly as we headed downstairs together. On the hotel patio, everyone had gathered for a barbecue.

My eyes scanned the crowd and landed on a greasy, pot-bellied man in the corner‚ÄîTimmy Brooks.

Timmy was a colleague from my department.

Older, unkempt, and with a reputation for harassing younger women, he‚Äôd made several uncomfortable advances toward Sarah. She‚Äôd once complained that his leering gaze made her skin crawl.

In my book, Timmy was trouble.

Just an hour ago, he‚Äôd approached me about swapping rooms.

‚ÄúLily, you and Ethan are sharing a room, right? Any chance you could switch with me?‚Äù

I frowned. ‚ÄúWhy? Is something wrong with your room? Can‚Äôt you just ask the front desk?‚Äù

He scratched his greasy hair awkwardly.

‚ÄúNah‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs too big. I prefer smaller rooms, but the front desk says they‚Äôre out. No one else wants to swap with me. But you and Ethan? That big room‚Äôs perfect for you two, right?‚Äù

At the time, we‚Äôd turned him down.

But now? Things had changed.

Let the creeps sort it out among themselves, I thought. I wanted to see Sarah‚Äôs face when she woke up in Timmy‚Äôs bed.

So I walked over to Timmy, flashing a friendly smile. ‚ÄúHey, Tim, still want to swap rooms? I talked it over with Ethan, and we‚Äôre fine with it.‚Äù",1,1757917469.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

1nheb4p,https://www.reddit.com/r/LostArkEU/comments/1nheb4p/whats_purpose_in_life_here_it_is/,what's purpose in life ? here it is!,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I tried most of it, but honestly? It never stuck.

What finally worked for me was embarrassingly simple. Nothing Instagram-worthy, but it cut almost an hour of wasted time out of my mornings:

1. **No phone for the first 30 minutes** I used to lose 20‚Äì25 minutes scrolling before even getting out of bed. Now I leave my phone charging in the next room and use a cheap alarm clock. The difference is huge.
2. **Batch the basics** Instead of making tiny decisions every morning (what to wear, what to eat, what bag to pack), I set up a ‚Äúdefault.‚Äù Same breakfast (overnight oats), clothes picked the night before, bag ready at the door. Saves me at least 15 minutes of dithering.
3. **Timers for transitions** Brushing teeth, making coffee, quick stretch.¬† I set a 5-minute timer for each. Weirdly, it keeps me from drifting into daydreaming or standing around.
4. **First task = one small win** I don‚Äôt start with email. Instead, I write down one 5-minute task (like clearing my desk or reviewing today‚Äôs top 3 priorities). It creates momentum instead of dragging me into other people‚Äôs agendas.

**Result:** I went from needing about 2 hours to ‚Äústart my day‚Äù to 1 hour. That extra hour now goes into focused work before distractions hit, and it feels like I‚Äôm finally ahead instead of playing catch-up.

Not glamorous. Not aesthetic. But it works for me.

‚ÄúJust a few more hours,‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúUntil tonight.‚Äù¬†

Tonight was everything. No more going back to that house. No more pretending they were family.¬†

I‚Äôd already asked for time off work. My boss spat at me. Called me lazy. Typical. Omegas always got the worst treatment.¬†

But I didn‚Äôt care tonight.¬†

I was going to Gabriel‚Äôs. My boyfriend. Soon-to-be fianc√©.¬†

Tomorrow was the Lunar Assembly. Sacred ceremony. Wolves finding their mates under the Moon Goddess. Tomorrow was also my¬†

eighteenth birthday. Finally old enough.¬†

Gabriel promised we‚Äôd bond tomorrow. I could escape forever.¬†

Gabriel. Rich. Gorgeous. An Alpha‚Äôs brother. Sure, I was just an omega. But Gabriel said bloodlines didn‚Äôt matter. Love mattered.¬†

I practically skipped toward his house. My heart hammered with excitement. Beautiful stone building in the center of town. So much¬†

better than our pathetic wooden shack. Soon I‚Äôd live here. With Gabriel. Forever.¬†

I knocked eagerly.¬†

Nothing.¬†

My smile faltered. That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ odd. Gabriel said he‚Äôd be waiting. He promised.¬†

I tried the handle. Unlocked. Relief flooded through me. He must be inside. Maybe preparing a surprise?¬†

‚ÄúGabriel? It‚Äôs me!‚Äù I called out cheerfully.¬†

Silence.¬†

Wait. What was that? Sounds from upstairs. My heart lifted again. He was home after all.¬†

Then I heard it clearly.¬†

Laughter.¬†

Female laughter.¬†

Moaning.¬†

My world stopped spinning. No. No, that couldn‚Äôt be-¬†

1/5¬†

The sounds grew louder. Clearer. Destroying me with every breath.¬†

Gasps. Bed springs creaking. A voice that made my soul shatter.¬†

‚ÄúOh God, Gabriel‚Ä¶ right there‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†

Valerie. My stepsister.¬†

My brain refused to process it. This wasn‚Äôt happening. This was a nightmare. I‚Äôd wake up any second.¬†

The bedroom door hung slightly open. Like a cruel invitation to witness my destruction. I saw them.¬†

Gabriel‚Äôs muscled back. Moving. Valerie‚Äôs pale body beneath him. Her golden hair fanned across his pillow like a victory flag.¬†

No no no no no.¬†

‚ÄúYou feel so much better than I imagined,‚Äù Gabriel panted.¬†

My heart exploded into a thousand pieces. Each word was a dagger.¬†

Valerie laughed. That cruel, sharp sound I knew so well. ‚ÄúBetter than that pathetic omega sister of mine, I bet. Poor little Sera probably¬†

doesn‚Äôt even know what to do with a real man.‚Äù¬†

The air left my lungs. I couldn‚Äôt breathe. Couldn‚Äôt think. Could only feel the agony ripping through my chest.¬†

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt.‚Äù Gabriel‚Äôs voice was rough. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt mention her when we‚Äôre like this.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù Valerie‚Äôs fingers traced his spine like she owned him. ‚ÄúAfter tomorrow, she‚Äôll know exactly where she stands. An omega like¬†

her could never satisfy you.‚Äù¬†

Each word was a physical blow. I stumbled backward, gasping for air. My shoulder slammed into the wall. The sound echoed like a¬†

gunshot.¬†

‚ÄúWhat was that?‚Äù Valerie hissed.¬†

My wolf surged forward. Rage I‚Äôd never felt before. My foot connected with the door. It crashed against the wall.¬†

‚ÄúWHAT THE HELL IS THIS?‚Äù¬†

They jumped apart. Gabriel nearly fell off the bed scrambling for his pants. Valerie just sat up. Didn‚Äôt even cover herself.¬†

‚ÄúSeraphina!‚Äù Gabriel went white. ‚ÄúI can explain-‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúExplain?‚Äù My voice cracked. ‚ÄúExplain how you‚Äôre screwing my sister?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not what you¬†

think-‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúIT‚ÄôS EXACTLY WHAT I THINK!‚Äù Tears streamed down my face. ‚ÄúYou lying, cheating bastard!‚Äù¬†

sympathy. ‚ÄúHow cute.‚Äù¬†

The world spun. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lying.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúAm I?‚Äù Valerie moved to the mirror. Ran her fingers through her hair. ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you go home and ask them? I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre waiting.¬†

Probably with our engagement announcement.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúSera, listen-‚Äù Gabriel finally got his pants on. ‚ÄúThis doesn‚Äôt have to change anything between us. We can still be friends-‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúFRIENDS?‚Äù I lunged toward him. He caught my wrists.¬†

‚ÄúYou need to calm down,‚Äù he said. His grip was tight. Bruising. ‚ÄúThink about your position. Your family. You don‚Äôt want to make this¬†

worse.‚Äù¬†

I stared into his eyes. Eyes that had whispered promises just days ago. Now they were cold. Calculating.¬†

‚ÄúLet go of me,‚Äù I whispered.¬†

‚ÄúSera-‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúLET GO OF ME!‚Äù¬†

I wrenched free and ran. I burst through our front door. Victor and Elizabeth sat calmly in the living room. An elegant invitation lay on¬†

the coffee table between them.¬†

They showed no surprise at my tear-stained face.¬†

‚ÄúYou already knew?‚Äù My voice was barely a whisper.¬†

‚ÄúSeraphina, sit down.‚Äù Victor‚Äôs voice was ice. ‚ÄúYes, we know about Gabriel and Valerie. We fully support it.‚Äù¬†

Elizabeth picked up the invitation. Held it out. ‚ÄúThis is their engagement announcement. Tomorrow at the Lunar Assembly, Gabriel will¬†

propose to Valerie. They hope you‚Äôll attend as Valerie‚Äôs sister.‚Äù¬†

I stared at the beautiful invitation. Gabriel and Valerie‚Äôs names in gold. The silver Nightshadow crest. It was all real.¬†

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù My voice cracked. ‚ÄúWhy would you do this to me?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúEnough!‚Äù Victor shot to his feet. Backhanded me across the face. Hard. I crashed to the floor. My cheek burned.¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre nothing but an abandoned child we took in out of pity. What right do you have to insult our daughter?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYou should be grateful we raised you.‚Äù Elizabeth‚Äôs voice was cold. ‚ÄúNow you know your place. Tomorrow you‚Äôll bless your sister‚Äôs¬†

engagement. Then find yourself a suitable omega mate.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt!‚Äù I struggled to my feet. Tasted blood. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never bless this betrayal!‚Äù¬†

I didn‚Äôt know where I was going; I only knew I couldn‚Äôt stop moving or the crushing pain would swallow me whole. I didn‚Äôt know how¬†

long I ran, but eventually I found myself on Main Street when a familiar voice made me stop.¬†

‚ÄúSera!‚Äù¬†

I spun around to see Ophelia running toward me, her dark hair flying behind her.¬†

‚ÄúI saw you run in-what happened? You look like you‚Äôve seen a ghost.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWorse.‚Äù I collapsed into her arms. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen the truth.‚Äù¬†

engagement. I‚Äôll be the laughingstock of the entire pack.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúListen to me, Sera.‚Äù Ophelia stroked my hair gently. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not waiting for that damned ceremony. Tonight, we‚Äôre going to Silver Moon¬†

Harbor!‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I pulled back to look at her, still having tears on my face.¬†

‚ÄúI heard there‚Äôs a huge party in Silver Moon Harbor tonight. Lots of wolves from other packs who are here for tomorrow‚Äôs ceremony will be there.‚Äù Ophelia‚Äôs eyes sparkled with excitement. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to have some fun and forget all about these bastards and your heartless¬†

family!‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶ but I‚Ä¶‚Äù I hesitated. As an omega, Silver Moon Harbor was completely foreign territory to me.¬†

‚ÄúBut what?‚Äù Ophelia gripped my hands. ‚ÄúSera, you‚Äôve lost everything here. Instead of staying to be humiliated tomorrow, let‚Äôs go to Silver¬†

Moon Harbor and try our luck. Maybe you‚Äôll meet your real destined mate-someone who won‚Äôt give a damn about your bloodline.‚Äù¬†

I looked into Ophelia‚Äôs determined eyes, thinking about the cruel words I‚Äôd heard in Gabriel‚Äôs bedroom, remembering my parents‚Äô cold¬†

faces, imagining the humiliation I‚Äôd face tomorrow‚Ä¶¬†

‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù I wiped away my tears, feeling a fierce courage I‚Äôd never experienced before. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go to Silver Moon Harbor tonight. Let all those¬†

people go to hell!‚Äù¬†

Ophelia grinned with delight. ‚ÄúNow that‚Äôs my Seraphina! Come on, let‚Äôs go back to my place and get ready. Tonight, we‚Äôre going to show the most beautiful girl!‚Äù¬†",1,1757917150.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,1,1.0,False
