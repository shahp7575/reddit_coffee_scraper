Hi All

I am having an issue with my Mara X. It has been running fine for almost two years, but I am noticing the following symptoms:

- the drip tray is filling up extremely quickly (usually full up in a day, after making two or three Coffees).
- the water purging area of the e61 is always hissing, and it gets much lounder at high pressures. 

Does anyone know what this could be? There is no consumer espresso servicing in my area, so I may need to fix this one myself.

Junkie - March 24 to May 18

“There’s bold thugs, but there’s never old thugs,” Adam’s father spoke with a sneer as he drove two knuckles into the boy’s sternum with a sharp prod.

Adam could still picture that day clearly, even now at 54. His father had been a bold thug, warning his son not to stray on the same path. Adam frowned a little deeper remembering his dad never lived to see 30. Hell, he never lived to see 26. His life cut short in a turf war by a barrage of bullets, one tearing through his father’s brain matter and another biting deeply into Adam’s shoulder at the tender age of 9 while the pair were at home. When the hailstorm ended moments after starting, Adam sobbed and cried for his father, clinging desperately to consciousness as he rolled over to see his father’s empty face: only a small bit of syrupy blood visible against his father’s messy, dark hair and a crimson tear from his swollen eye. The boy’s whimpering faded and his father’s lifeless expression seared into his memory against the backdrop of the arid, Los Angelos section 8 ghetto.

Adam rubbed his shoulder in response to phantom pain, sighing as he wondered what his father would think of him now. In his younger days, Adam had worked odd jobs in construction. It was fast and decent money at the time. And between that he moved lesser drugs and gambled, the sour smell of cigarettes and hangovers ever present on his unkempt attire and breath. He loved pills when he could get them, but as his age advanced he increasingly found himself settling for heroin or fent when he couldn’t fight for the good stuff, but he wasn’t a junkie, he convinced himself. He regularly sported a black eye or a fat lip, and that much was true even in present days. He was getting too old for this shit. And in thug years, he was ancient. 

He had settled down at one point with a homely woman named Josefa and had a few pups of his own. But he never had the opportunity to poke his firm fingers into their chests like his father had to him because he returned to the concrete jungle before they were old enough to learn that a lesson. Never learning that lesson himself, he held a grudge to the gang that took his father, but had refused allegiance to the opposing side as well. One day he gulped grain alcohol and sulked, feeling emboldened to make his enemies’ day as unpleasant as they had made his so many years ago. 

The sound of shattering glass was much louder than Adam had intended, but his inebriation left him too confident and too foolish. He used another brick to remove the remaining shards of the window. The store he broke into was a front, but at least he knew that the night he chose was a rare evening that his old nemesis was mostly occupied. They were still downstairs, but the music they played would be too loud to hear the glass, and the air would be too thick with tar smoke and drugs to guide any coherent worry, he assured himself. Undoubtedly, he was being reckless. He took one last gulp, smashed the bottle against a rickety book shelf, and threw the match into the pool of bitter alcohol after he lit up the last menthol in his pocket.

The blaze quickly grabbed purchase on the light fuels of the shelf and spread to the raggedy curtains near the window. Now they licked against the ceiling until they fully spilled up and smoke began to pour into the room. Adam discarded the empty case of cigarettes into the growing fire, eyes flickering with embers, and stumbled back towards his entry point. 

He mistook the first bullet for a bee whirring by his head, and he let gravity do the rest of his escape through the shattered window. He rolled on the ground and patted his ear, shocked to see blood. Briefly the memory of his father flashed behind his eyes and his heart raced. He clumsily pushed himself up and ran in whatever direction his body wanted to go. 

“Not bees,” he thought, “wasps.” 

The inferno was really going now, and people poured from the derelict shop exactly as hornets do to protect their brood. Another buzz followed by the ping of a bullet ricocheting off of a run down Explorer a few paces beside him. A third buzz, but this one found its mark in Adam’s buttocks. He yelped and fell forward, thrashing like a wounded horse on a race track and hurling profanities, but adrenaline urged him forward and he rolled under another car for temporary haven.

He survived that night. The bullet rested in the fat of his ass. He tended the wound on his own, keeping his head down as not to draw attention and place him there that night as the inebriated arsonist. Who would suspect a worn out 54 year old gang banger anyways? He thought of his escape.

“You got family up there?” The social worker spoke flatly, keyboard clicking behind her vacant words and exaggerated fake nails.

“Yes ma’am,” Adam lied sheepishly. 

She was silent, sternly reading her screen. “Well, if you test negative you can leave tomorrow. Corona is overwhelming the shelters here, the ones up there seem to be keeping it at bay. I guess it’s a good idea to leave.” She paused to glare at him. “Go see the medic for the test, then I’ll get you on the plane.”

A couple days later, Adam sat in the center of his cot at the congregate shelter far from the streets he knew, with shoulders slouched and eyes low, body trembling and sweating. Andrea plodded toward him.

“You’re a new face,” She spoke with a touch of questioning, hoping for a free response.

He was silent.

“I know I’m in uniform, but I’m not out to get you.” She started, watching him try to steady the shakes. “When did you start withdrawals?”

“I’m not a junkie,” his hispanic accent was always sharpest when he was offended.

Andrea’s expression spoke more than anything she could say as she shot him an incredulous scowl. Adam’s eyes darted with guilt.

“This is day two or three,” he spoke quietly, barely above a murmur.

She stooped to meet his height and held out a hand. Adam lifted his to hers, shaking, and she wrapped her cool fingertips around his wrist to feel his pulse. It was fast, a bit weak, but still strong enough to be acceptable.

“Are they getting worse?”

“They’ve stayed the same for about a day,” he whispered.

“Okay. If they get worse, you need medical attention.” She gently tucked his hand into his lap and her eyes were wrought with concern.

“Yes ma’am,” Adam eased a bit, “this isn’t the first time I’ve done this. I know what to expect.” 

She nodded and pulled a couple ginger candies from her pocket, “these might take the edge off the nausea.” She said with a smile. She also handed him her card, assuring him that even though it said PD that she was more concerned about seeing him survive his detox.



By day four, Adam felt like dying. His clothes were drenched and he reeked of sour body odor. He knew how quickly a hit would ease his discomfort, but he was too old for this, he had to change once and for all. 

“Just another week or two,” he assured himself. “And it’d all be water under the bridge. Just another week or two…”

“Old Man, come get some fresh air,” Nubz spoke quietly. He was a soft spoken young man whose expression rarely showed anything but sorrow. 

Adam winced at the intrusion, but the kid was right. He rolled forward and reached out his hand to Nubz for support to stand. Nubz obeyed, stretching forward what was left of his hand. Adam frowned looking at the limb: only a scarred lump remained. He then looked at Nubz’ face and gestured the boy’s hand away, standing on his own with a groan. Nubz led Adam to the den just beyond the congregate shelter where Virgil sat against a wall, smiling dumbly into the brisk night. 

Adam’s voice and body protested the effort to sit on the ground. He placed himself beside Virgil, and Nubz joined quietly too. They passed brief introductions. 

Virgil, a chubby man roughly the same age as Adam, saw Nubz as a son. Nubz had joined the streets a few years prior after losing his entire family to a tragic accident, the light in his eyes snuffed with the passing of his dear sister and mother. His fingers followed with frostbite. Much like Adam, Virgil had tried sobriety, succeeded, and relapsed, and partly that was out of fear for Nubz. He didn’t want the kid to be alone again. So Nubz and Virgil wandered the streets together, inebriated or high depending on the day, each other serving as the closest thing to family that either would ever have again.

Nubz pawed at the plastic lid of some shit liquor, struggling to twist the cap without fingers. 

“Give it here, kid,” Virgil demanded half teasing, half complaining at Nubz’ speed, or lack thereof. Virgil spun the cap like a top, sending it bouncing across the ground before he took a generous swig and laughed, his honking humor sounding like a clown’s toy horn. Nubz smiled silently with a closed mouth, eyes brightening slightly. Adam was observing, trying not to draw attention to his weakened and sickly state. He clasped his hands tightly together in his lap. 

“They’ll give you clean clothes if you ask, haha” Virgil laughed.

Virgil fished clumsily in his pocket, revealing a filthy bubble and a lighter. He struck the lighter a few times before it finally sustained a flame and he held it to the browned, glass pipe. Tendrils of smoke started to slither from the narrow chamber and he inhaled deeply, relishing the false warmth it brought and ignoring its bite in his lungs. He nonchalantly held the object to Adam. 

“No, no.” Adam stoutly declined, nervously looking to Virgil and then to Nubz and then to his potential exit. In the distance he noticed a tall figure.

“It’s shit dope. Weak.” Virgil reassured. “It’ll take the edge off those shakes, wean you off like you’re supposed to. Ha.”

“No. I’ve-” Adam stammered, looking back at his exit. “I’ve done this before, cold turkey is best for me.”

“Relax, pen-day-ho, HA HA” Virgil teased, exaggerating the pronunciation to make light that Adam was a minority amongst minorities, and he broke into a loud, honking laughter. Nubz joining him. 

Adam smiled and cautiously took the bubble, rolling the bulbous end between his fingers. He too struggled to light it, but eventually the flame took and the noxious wisps of smoke began to form as the dark sludge boiled. He held it to his mouth and inhaled deeply, when he noticed that the tall man was closer and his details somewhat apparent. 

His face was long and drooping, his hair unkempt, and he moved in small, rigid motions. He looked wet. His skin clung to him like cling wrap. Adam wanted to protest the sight, but he felt his body relax with the familiar invite of his fix. He watched the tall, sagging man cock his head inquisitively towards them as if studying them. Virgil’s laugh overpowered every other sound in the blissful haze, and soon Adam paid no more attention.



The hangover the next morning was worse. Adam wasn’t surprised. He knew better. It always bit harder when it returned if you faltered. He watched steam billow off his nearly translucent coffee. It had been diluted by staff to stretch the pot. He wrapped his bony fingers around the white paper cup and frowned knowing that the shakes had returned, but if he focused he could still calm them briefly. 

He wasn’t the only one staring blankly in the cafeteria. Staff played the only available DVD, and a few vacant, dirty faces watched the flatly narrated nature documentary about insects. A fat caterpillar, swollen with the larva of a parasitic wasp visible beneath its flesh uneventfully crawled across a branch, and Adam’s stomach churned at the thought. He gagged briefly, overtaken by lightheadedness and he flinched, splashing the hot fluid across his lap. 

He stumbled to the bathroom, and staff provided him with a dry, clean pair of pants. Inside, he clutched the sink trying to get a grip on himself. The shakes were getting worse rapidly and his want for a fix was too. “Just another week or two,” he thought, and cupped water into his hands, watching ripples form as his muscles twitched beyond his control. He held the water on his face, letting it wash across him with his eyes closed. 

When he opened his eyes, the tall figure stood in the threshold of the open maintenance closet in the men’s restroom. It was normally secured and locked, but it was open this time and Adam hadn’t initially noticed. He spun around, revealing the now empty maw of the closet and took a few steps closer. He clenched his fist, adrenaline masking his previous pallor. The incandescent bulb couldn’t penetrate the windowless chamber of that small, dank place. Like a curtain, the shadows ceased at the door itself, and Adam listened to the echoing of his heart and errant, leaky plumbing. He willed himself another step forward, pupils wide, and the stench of ammonia and rancid water grew stronger. There was something in there, he could hear it squelching in the shadows just below an audible sound and he could feel its wet, glossy eyes watching him back. Something predatory in the murk with a droning grumble like endless, battering waves.

The bathroom door swung open, “Pendejo! Haha!” Virgil honked. 

Adam clutched his chest in a panic and rolled his eyes to see Virgil, briefly glancing back to the closet. The sense of dread he previously felt had lifted, and he chocked it up to withdrawals.

“Virgil,” Adam started, never smiling in return, “who’s dealing out here?”

“Well, uh, ha… ha.” Virgil’s voice was laced with nervousness. He may have partaken in the garbage himself from time to time, but he never liked to see anyone else actually need it. “That’d be Peter. His girls usually push it for him, don’t often deal directly with him. He’s the only one with something still, ever since the pigs doubled down.” He spoke solemnly. “Adam… he’s a dangerous man.” 



The rain finally let up, but it hadn’t stopped completely, steadily falling in lazy drops now. The ground was saturated and the puddles overflowed. Every low pocket in the earth was full and the asphalt glistened like dark ice. 

Adam threw his hood over his face and hung his head low, trotting in the puddles while he loathed his worn out sneakers in the dampness. A man swayed beside a boarded shop as Adam approached. He fought gravity, unaware of Adam’s presence, and quickly lost to the force of physics. He rolled in a deep puddle, splashing Adam as he fell. Adam cursed the man under his breath. 

The man thrashed in the puddle. It was particularly deep in the neglected side walk. He couldn’t right himself and choked, pulling mouthfuls of water into his lungs and triggering a heavy coughing fit that evolved to gagging, and, eventually, he emptied the contents of his stomach into the puddle, still fighting not to drown in his blitzed state. Chunks of pasta and desiccated tomato skins floated in the still, oily water as he fell face first again into the puddle, exhausted and surrendering. Adam grabbed the man by his collar and pulled him back, wincing to see his pinpoint pupils in his drifting eyes. This could be his future, he thought. He shoved the man against the store front and rolled his head back to ease his breathing. He’d be fine.

In the eaves of a convenience store next to the abandoned shop, a young Philippino woman watched the ordeal. She wore a skirt too short to be practical with thick makeup, dreading the rain ruining her mask. Her legs were marked in goosebumps in the chill. Beneath the cheap foundation and hastily applied eye liner, her face was thick with sorrow. She was easily young enough to be Adam’s kid.

“Most would have let him drown. How brave of you.” She smirked as he approached her.

“My place is just around the corner-”

“No,” Adam interrupted. “I don’t want you. I just want a fix.”

“Fine,” she hissed as her expression changed to a scowl. She pulled her phone from under her breast, her red fingernails briefly clacking on the screen as she typed. “He’ll be right here. I don’t have any today. Go over there.” She gestured to the other side of the store’s exterior.

Adam sauntered quietly over to the proud structural beam and tucked his head down, waiting seemingly for ages. Every person that walked their way, he looked to the girl and she shook her head no. But eventually, a white man in a worn hoodie, blue jeans, and tacky cowboy boots slowly strolled towards them. Adam glanced towards her and her silent nervousness affirmed his unasked question. 

Peter wasn’t anything elaborate. Hidden beneath the baggy garment he hid lean, average muscles and a mess of sun-born freckles. His hair was slightly thinning, and he hadn’t shaved today. He wore a polite, disarming expression that only cracked when he knew he had the upper hand or if you knew to look for the malice hidden in the corner of his eyes and the dilation of his pupils. He had savagely hungry eyes, but to the untrained observer he could dull their spark on a whim. He hid in plain sight.  

The Philippino woman kept her head low and her chest open, hoping the submissive, flirty posture would disarm his unpredictable power. Adam couldn’t hear them speak, but even from a distance he could see something had gone wrong. Peter’s posture changed and he grabbed her arm with a purposeful jab, pulling her to the alley. Adam waited until they rounded the corner before he followed.

“Who the fuck is that?” Peter hissed.

“A client,” she stammered, “he wanted-”

Before she could finish Peter rose his hand and struck her hard across the face with his knuckles, knocking her to the ground. “You dumb bitch, the pigs are too hot right now. I told you this. What did I say? WHAT DID I SAY?” He said, grabbing her and swinging her into the wall.

“No one knew! No one new…” She panted, a small line of blood forming on her lip. 

“Chignon, ease up on her.” Adam interrupted. “I just want some dope. Listen, if I was a rat would I shake this bad?” He held hands in front of him while his limbs trembled.

“Who the fuck are you?” Peter dropped the woman and turned to face him.

“I’m an old addict,” he moved his hands to gesture peace, “I just want a fix-” before he could finish stars erupted in his gaze as Peter threw a firm punch into his face. Crimson erupted from Adam’s nose. He tried to crawl away, but Peter’s hooked kick knocked the wind out of Adam’s lungst. Adam desperately tried to reach the exposure of the open street rather than the secrets of the alley in his stunned state.

Adam crawled away like a dog while Peter relaxed his posture, circling his prey. Adam thought how, once upon a time, he would have given a man like Peter a run for his money. Before Adam could react again to his approaching threat, Peter placed his foot firmly between Adam’s shoulder blades and brought Adam flat to the earth, plunging him into the puddle of detritus, oil, and vomit. Adam jerked his face to the side and sputtered, gasping to clear the water from his airway, but Peter grabbed him by his hair and drove his face into the water again. 

Adam thought for a fleeting moment how undignified it was to drown in vomit, but how much worse that fate felt when he knew it wasn’t his own. His mind wondered if he felt something brush against his cheek, a piece of hastily chewed and partially digested food floating in the puddle. “Old thugs,” Adam thought as his vision grew dark, remembering his father’s warning and loathing his own legacy now.

But before Adam lost consciousness, Peter pulled him out of the water, throwing him on his back at the feet of the snoring man nearby. Adam gasped and choked, desperate for air. But in one, final insult to the old man, Peter again brought down his foot, plunging the heel of his thick boot with all his force into Adam’s hip with a crunch, and fracturing the sweeping arch of Adam’s pelvis. Adam shrieked. Peter breathed heavily for a moment and smiled, readjusting his pants when he heard sirens in the distance. The sky opened up again, washing the freshly flowing blood from Adam’s nose.

The woman had fled and the store had locked its doors in response to the fight. But Adam heard slowly plodding footsteps above the rain. He warily blinked his eyes open, half expecting to see Peter there ready to finish the job. Instead, there stood a tall man with a drooping face and a rancid left eye. His other eye was cold and distant, his body as soaked as if he had also been rolling in the putrid puddle himself. He moved his head back and forth in curiosity, in observation, twitching briefly like a cat’s skin before pouncing. With an open palm, the tall man reached for Adam, wrapping his long fingers around Adam’s ankle and pulled, dragging him towards the alley. Adam kicked weakly and cursed, and the man hissed. A PD cruiser rounded the corner, and the man released Adam, quietly disappearing into the wet alley as quickly as he had appeared and Adam’s vision faded.



Andrea helped walk an old woman into the ER. “She probably needs sutures,” she spoke factually to the nurse, reaching for a warmed blanket for the frail soul beside her. 

“We’ll get her patched up and let her warm up a while,” the nurse assured. 

She was ready to leave when she caught the familiar face in a neglected corner of the wing.

“Adam,” she spoke inquisitively, “you practically just got here.” 

He exhaled a weak chortle.

“What’s the damage?”

“Aside from the obvious?” He retorted, opening his less swollen eye to see her. “Broken hip.""

“God, I’m so sorry, Adam. How is your pain? I wouldn’t judge you if that set you back.”

“No, no, I refused. They gave me ‘super ibuprofen,’ that’s how they described it. It isn’t doing shit.”

She nodded, frowning to imagine his suffering but proud to hear he stood resolute. It had taken a scare on his life, but he would beat it this time. “Who did this to you?”

“Virgil says his name is Peter.” He winced.

Andrea scrunched her lips and nodded, unsurprised. “Are you pressing charges?”

“What’s the point?” He whimpered.

She nodded slowly again. She was silent.

“Andrea,” Adam’s voice switched rapidly to urgency with her name and back to contemplation. “When I was a boy, my papa told me about the men in the desert. You didn’t cross them. If you pissed them off, they’d hack your head off with a rusty lawnmower blade, make a message out of you. If you were lucky, they’d use a machete instead. But they were men with an agenda. You could buy them off. You could take their side.” He paused to rest, wincing at the pain. Adam opened his good eye as wide as he could, terrified, “there’s something out there that you can’t buy off.” 



Sepsis - March 30 to October 23

Harvey swayed. He stood at the top of a knoll, exposed, watching the earliest summer tourists move below and around him in the small park in the heart of the city. Flickering consciousness rolled in and out of his mind. There wasn’t much left to him, not that there ever was in the first place. Moments of lucidity flashed behind his eyes as neurons progressively died and a thick tendril of drool hung dumbly from his gaping mouth. To any tourist, he was just another tweaker out of his mind.

“Give me some,” Phyllis demanded like a toddler, as she always did. “You’ve got some good stuff on you, I can tell.” She laughed at Harvey and his apparent stupor.

Harvey didn’t respond beyond the growing length of slimy saliva on his chin.

“I haven’t seen you in a while,” Phyllis spoke anxiously. She reached to touch him.

Harvey finally stirred, reacting with a violent spasm and his eyes and face twitched. Phyllis frowned, unsure what to say or do to his peculiar actions. She’d seen him tweak, but never like this. 

Harvey’s pupil dilated in his good eye and the dead, left eye remained milky and rotting. He scoped her from head to toe. She felt uncomfortable under his gaze. He felt predatory. 

“What’s in it for me?” Harvey sneered. 

Phyllis’ expression flooded with sorrow. She was getting tired of using her body as a bargaining chip. “You know… I could…” she stammered, “I could suck-“

“No.” Harvey interrupted her, and the tendril of spit swung wildly. He eyed her keenly as he sharply inhaled. “More.”

“Yeah. Yeah… that’s fine.” She spoke solemnly and dropped her eyes to his feet. 

Harvey nodded, patting his pocket to confirm if the foil and needle he’d felt earlier were still there. He didn’t remember placing them there, but he had felt them earlier and had enough consciousness still to bargain. 

His memories never felt like his own anymore, and each day he felt progressively detached. It wasn’t the haze of drugs or alcohol, he hadn’t touched either in days, no longer bound by their vices. But it was similar. He’d been sober, against his will but without protest, to the best of his failing mind since his last clear memory, his drugs still in his pocket since then.

Some days after Laura had died, when he was still banished from the congregate shelter for his previous antics, he slept quietly and drunkenly between bins of rancid trash and debris a few blocks away. The last thing he could scantly remember was choking, gagging, and gasping for air, as if he had vomited in his sleep. He dreamed of some large, wet animal crawling its way down his throat and nestling in his belly. A grotesque mongrel with bare skin, fibrous muscle exposed.

But with each passing day his phantom confusion chipped away more and more at his cognizance and he felt increasingly like a husk. Even his eye throbbed less despite its worsening state. Every day: a blur, and even less of a concern now as he stood on the knoll. Now he was only hungry, distant, and foreign in his own flesh. No food could satiate him, and he lustfully eyed bodies with warm wombs. 

Phyllis dutifully pulled him by his arm a few blocks over, down where the street dropped to a gully and the alders were thick enough to provide cover. Trash littered the trampled earth, this was a regular haunt out of the public eye. She pawed at his belt, thinking, what need did he have for a belt when he never bothered to latch it? And she frowned to see his skin. He was always dirty and gaunt, but presently his skin looked so tired and sagged so unnaturally over his bones, like flesh that had given up or was beginning to slough from a saturated corpse… like melting wax. She shimmied her hips from her cotton leggings and he descended upon her with equal ferocity and purpose. And when they were done, he handed her the drugs and staggered off, leaving her confused why he didn’t stick around to share. 

Harvey - rather, what was once Harvey - learned how to get more of the drug. And Phyllis grew more enthused to continue their transaction because he never took some for himself. He even regularly came back with good shit, stuff that only Peter would offer her on rare occasion. She didn’t bother to question how, and quickly didn’t care how sickly Harvey looked, ignoring the faint smell of decay that seemed to follow him. She was high, and between Peter and Harvey she’d choose Harvey a hundred times over. 

Time passed and the ritual repeated nearly daily, but one day Harvey abruptly vanished again. Phyllis picked at her skin, anxious for her high when she couldn’t find him. She surprised herself, however, with how long she endured before she finally sought out Peter. A few days at least, burning through the stash she collected from Harvey. And Peter feigned his sympathy when she ultimately returned to him.



Phyllis vomited her meager meal into the shelter’s toilet. She was still spitting bitter acid from her mouth into the bowl when another woman banged on the stall, demanding that Phyllis hurry. Phyllis ignored the raspy voice’s impatience, waiting impatiently herself for the off brand pregnancy test to finish. Peter had cut her supply recently, and she hoped her nausea could be answered by that. 

She dry heaved now, gagging further at the sight and smell of the yellow-brown bile she spat into the water. She wiped her eyes and nose, wet with forced tears and snot, and glanced down at her knees where the test rested. Two lines had appeared. She understood quickly what that meant, and she bellowed deeply on the dingy bathroom tile. Once again, the smoker’s voice barked for her to hurry up and now to shut up. 

By June, Phyllis had been relocated to a different shelter for pregnant women and those with children. She’d been there before, but she was angry this time. She resented the whores that shared that space with her, especially those that bounced their newborn infants on their knees, whispering quietly in hushed, babbling joy to their babies that their housing had been approved. They’d relapse too, she thought spitefully to herself, they’d be in her shoes soon enough.

By mid summer, Phylis was informed she was carrying twins. The nurses and other staff pleaded with her to stop drinking if she was going to continue the pregnancy. The worry always fell on deaf ears. By September, her OBGYN halfheartedly warned her that one of her babies was significantly smaller than the other. “A complication of drinking as much as you do,” she sighed, “you’re killing them,” she sneered. It wasn’t professional, but it was true. Phyllis didn’t care. By October, she was swollen with her offspring. She begged Peter for something, anything, but he scowled at her in disgust. “Who would want your dirty ass? You did this to yourself.” He laughed, flicking a cigarette butt at her. 

By October 23, Phyllis was numb. She scored enough pocket change to stumble into a liquor store, and the 22-year-old cashier stared in mixed disbelief and disgust as he rang up her purchase of cheap vodka. The double-headed eagle on the logo poised in prideful triumph: her vice would always win. 

With the bottle mostly finished, she sat against the only cover she could find under the loading bay of the modern City Hall. She wailed her mournful cries in the dark while fat raindrops fell around her. Black puddles sparkled in sickly gold from nearby lights with each ripple that disturbed them. She took the last gulp and howled, casting the plastic bottle into the night and it skittered across the wet asphalt.

A small man shambled up to her and plopped next to her, drawing his shoulders in with the cold. “Got anymore?” He smiled under his wiry mustache. 

Phyllis staggered to her feet, splaying them wide to sure her stance, “get away from me!” She screamed, kicking at him. 

He shoved her, cursing, “fuck off, psycho bitch!”

She stumbled once or twice and spun before she fell on her protruding belly. She shrieked and moaned, rolling uncomfortably on the ground. The man stared wide eyed, frantically scanning around him, and broke into an uncoordinated sprint to flee his fault.

She crawled back to the wall, clutching her large stomach. Her vision swirled and a sudden, intense agony rushed her. She could feel them move. She remembered, from the past, what it felt like to feel her baby kick, but this felt more like something trying to escape. Pain bit through her abdomen in searing waves.

She bit her lip between grunts and screams. Sweat covered her and she felt lightheaded. She pushed, and a slurry of blood and mucus poured from her groin. She felt a lump between her legs, granting her some relief with its sudden presence. She pulled the front of her pants down and fumbled, grabbing the warm mass with deliberate harshness. Fear heavy on her face, she cradled the premature infant in her palms. It’s skin was a delicate red and everything about it was fragile. It never cried. 

Reality struck her as if the dead infant she held was now too hot to hold, and she frantically dropped it. Panting, she cried for help to the night, but the second time she called, the pain returned tenfold. She winced and pulled her freshly bloodied hoodie up and over her belly and breasts in a panic. The white of her eyes flashed against her face as she watched her abdomen writhe and stretch. The urge to push overtook her and she groaned. 

Phyllis groped at the walls as if she was futilely trying to escape her own body. Even in her drunken and wounded state, she realized she couldn’t crawl away from something inside of her. She pushed as the contractions worsened. Laying flat, she arched her hips up and pulled her soiled pants off her legs, pushing herself away with her wriggling belly pointed to the night sky. 

She pushed again, and this time more bloodied fluid erupted from her, splattering and spraying the ground. Another push: a membranous sac squeezed out of her gravid body with a sickening squelch. Phyllis wept, desperately clinging to consciousness as she spent the last of her energy to crawl using her arms. She rolled away from whatever she expelled from her body, and she laid on her side, whimpering.

The sac abruptly shivered after prolonged stillness. It shook harder and more erratically and stretched until it tore. Phyllis’ shallow breaths raced as she watched it, but she desperately rolled once again as she pulled herself through a puddle to escape. Gritty water and bodily fluids mixed to a slurry on the street.

A fetal hand emerged from the membrane. Slowly, the infant slithered from its cocoon and rested. Phyllis couldn’t see it clearly, but its flesh seemed to warp and settle in the darkness. It gasped suddenly, choking on the thick slime that clung to its face and it cried for attention and in frustration while Phyllis continued to put steady distance between it and herself. She trailed blood behind her.

Adrenaline coursed through her and she felt acutely sobered. She pushed herself up to look when she could no longer hear the infant’s cries and instead heard a wet patter across the ground. She sobbed when she turned to face her baby, now perching on narrow, stilted legs and observing her keenly with unnaturally wide set eyes. Its umbilical cord hung from its mouth and its neck bulged. It swallowed hard, the lump in its throat sliding down to its pudgy belly and slurped its afterbirth. 

It chirped at her affectionately, stretching its neck to explore her before placing a clawed foot against her chest and shoving her to the ground. She wept quietly as it began to suckle. It greedily sucked milk when she reached out and slapped its face with a forceful blow. It fell back and kicked wildly on its back until it righted itself and growled. Its face split diagonally from the top of its head down its throat, revealing a wretched mouth full of thick, curved teeth. And finally it ran towards her, hungry for blood instead.",2,1757922730.0,creepcast,1,1.0,False

**The Setup:**  
Clube de Regatas Brasil (CRB) hosts Amazonas FC in a Série B clash where the underdogs (Amazonas) are about as likely to win as my chance of remembering to water my plants. CRB, fresh off five days of training and a full roster, is favored to the tune of **-0.75 goals on the spread** (odds: -111) and **1.62 decimal odds to win outright** (implied probability: \~61.7%). Amazonas? They’re priced at **5.75** (17.4% implied) to pull off the upset—about the same chance as me napping without my coffee.

**Key Stats:**

* CRB has 34 points (10W-4D-11L), sitting just outside the top 6. A win here could rocket them to 7th.
* Amazonas trails with 29 points (8W-5D-12L), stuck in the muck of mediocrity.
* The \*\*over/under is 2.25 goals

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

We started sitting together & then doing coffee after church. I found out he was 23 (at the time) on the second “date” and felt awful for even caring. He’s got a great career & a good head on his shoulders. But I do feel like there is that immaturity of a typical 24 year old guy sometimes that bothers me. 

I’m turning 28 in December & I started talking about plans & he said “only 2 more birthdays till you’re 30, basically middle aged”. And it was totally a joke and our typical humor. We’ve been together for 7-months, but I am struggling with the almost 4-year gap & it’s really just the idea of it more than any thing. He could tell it upset me and he apologized and clearly didn’t mean it negatively. 

How do I let go of the little voice in my head and stop letting it bother me? And just be happy with the relationship or is an almost 4-year age gap truly just too difficult to work through?

Why is this happening and how do I pace it?,"26M in NYC here. I made a Hinge last week and I’m honestly overwhelmed (not a humblebrag, just looking for advice).

In 7 days I’ve gotten a lot more attention than I expected. Roughly:
	
•	Day 1: ~10 matches, Day 2: ~20, Day 3: ~30–50, and then ~10–30/day after that.
	
•	About 194 matches total this week.
	
•	42 people shared their numbers, 5 prefer to keep chatting on the app, 4 shared IG, 1 shared Snapchat.
	
•	I’ve been clearing the “Likes You” tab daily. Each day I get 10-30 likes.
	
•	The one thing I’m doing differently vs past tries is sending a message with every like.

This is very different from my experience on Tinder/Bumble/older Hinge attempts, so I’m trying to understand what’s going on and how to handle it respectfully.

Questions:
	
1.	Why the surge? Is this likely a “new profile” boost, something about NYC, my messaging-with-like habit, or something else about the algorithm?
	
2.	How do I pace this without burning out? If multiple people want to meet, what’s a reasonable number of dates per week so I don’t flake or get exhausted?
	
3.	How do I keep interest without overpromising? Is it okay to say, “My week’s packed, but I’d love to grab coffee next week — does Tues/Wed work?” Or should I offer a short phone/video chat first to keep momentum?
	
4.	Any good scripts/templates for politely spacing things out (e.g., letting someone know I’m interested but can’t meet for ~1–2 weeks), without sounding dismissive?

I’m not trying to waste anyone’s time. I want to be upfront, considerate, and realistic about my bandwidth while still meeting people I click with. Any insights on the algorithm side, pacing strategies, or communication tips would be super helpful. Thank you!

EDIT 1: Formatting was messed up.

TL;DR: 26M in NYC. New Hinge profile, ~194 matches in 7 days after sending a message with every like. Overwhelmed. Why might this be happening (new profile boost? NYC? messaging approach?), and how do I schedule dates/communicate expectations so I don’t burn out or lose people’s interest?",1,1757920448.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

When it was just the friends they asked me if it was her, but then she asked me if it was someone else. I denied both because I was nervous.

But then she’ll go right back to doing the same things she always does around me, acting nervous being really flirty and all the other stuff.

1nhezz1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1nhezz1/long_distance_issues/,Long distance issues.,"So hopefully to turn a long story short. I met someone in January and we fell in love very fast and unexpectedly. She already had plans to move several states away to pursue her masters degree at the end of the summer but the relationship felt so perfect we decide to continue on anyway. After 6 truly amazing months together, the end of July comes and I help her move in and so starts the long distance part of the story. Neither of us were adjusting well. She was having issues getting a new job, leaving her friends and developing a social life in her new state and I became very depressed and unsure if long distance would work out ( i realize now I was just in my head too much about not having them around). Ik there's no justification and I take full accountability for my actions, but I cheated on them with my ex. I waited about 6 days before I broke down and told them.I immediately stopped all of my bad habits, started therapy and got us both workbook/ journals for the situation. After a week of talking about it we broke up. I would love to have a second chance and I really feel I can prove I'm worth it. She says she's not sure she can forgive me for cheating and wouldn't want to continue a relationship and hold it over me forever Her solution to figure this out is to go no contact until a day in the winter (Nov/Dec) where we get coffee. I have no idea if we'll get back together or not until that day. All I feel I can do now is continue to work on myself and try to get over the relationship I used to have.

 I want to make some chocolate cakes for my Sisters birthday tomorrow. I wanted to go with the much recommended method of adding some coffee to the cake to enhance the cocoa chocolate taste. However in trying to compare recipes I noticed something. All the recipes that add coffee use oil instead of creamed butter. Why is that? Will it be bad to try and force it?

 I found this because I had bought ingredients for a basic chocolate cake recipe that had no wet ingredients outside of eggs and a splash of milk and I was trying to work out how to adapt it. Is there something about creamed butter that does not work with much liquid?

For reference I started from the simple cake recipe from Barry Lewis' website where his wife does one, but I was inspired by his more complicated videos to add coffee.",3,1757919848.0,Cooking,4,1.0,False

1nhexlp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1nhexlp/roommate_horror_story/,Roommate horror story,"My roommate got a subleaser for the last month and a half of our lease. I was gone for the summer, so when I came back she had already moved in, and both of my roommates had already moved out. My roommates warned me that she was not great, but little did I know what was in store for me…

When I arrived home, almost everything of mine in the apartment was gone (except for what was in my room). All my toiletries, decorations, everything. I asked her about it, and she said she had hidden all my stuff away because she didn’t know I was coming back, and that my roommate who subleased to her told her she’d be living alone. That was a blatant lie. The posting she responded to said she’d be living with two other girls, and both of my roommates had told her multiple times that I was coming back, even giving her the exact date a week before. I brushed it off, but during that conversation I realized something else about her.

She does not let anyone else speak. Like, at all. She would ask me questions and then immediately interrupt or talk over me before I could answer. I have never met someone I was absolutely unable to have a conversation with. The first couple of days I tried, even reminding her to “please let me speak” multiple times every conversation, but she was just incapable of it. I’d never experienced anything like it. She also made me uncomfortable multiple times, going into detail about her masturbation habits and ranting about how much she hated my other roommate (who had only lived with her for three days). I told her again and again I was uncomfortable and wanted to switch topics, but she wouldn’t. By the third day I gave up trying to converse with her at all. That didn’t stop her from talking at me constantly.

Oh, and did I mention she’s 40 years old (we’re all in our mid-twenties) and studying to be a therapist? That was when I developed a real fear for her future patients.

She also completely filled up the fridge, and it smelled so bad I honestly worried there was a rotting body in there. I had to hold my breath every time I went into the kitchen. I asked her politely to clean out whatever was rotting—four separate times—and every time she got incredibly defensive. She was completely incapable of taking feedback and probably one of the least self-aware people I’ve ever met. She’d get super mad at me for making any noise past 8 p.m. when she went to bed, but then grind coffee beans and vacuum outside my door at 5 a.m. when she knew I was sleeping. Things like that happened constantly.

She was also rude, naive, and condescending. One time she told me—aggressively and completely unprovoked—that in her “professional opinion” I needed to get a therapist to help me cope with the miserable life I must have since I “felt the need to do drugs.” This was after she saw me smoke weed once. She even said she thought I overdosed. I don’t think she’s ever seen a high person before, and she had never even seen a bong. Whenever I lent her something and later asked for it back, she would insist it had always been hers—basically stealing from me. But she was impossible to argue with because I couldn’t even get a word in. And honestly, this is only the tip of the iceberg.

A few hours after I moved out, she sent me a super rude and unprovoked text. I really want to send one back and tell her exactly what I think of her. I held my tongue through every single interaction we had, and I’m dying to let loose. But my parents think I should wait until she’s moved out in case she tries to retaliate against our security deposit. They also think the higher road is to just say nothing.

Here’s where I’m conflicted: she’s 40 years old, has no money, no job, no marriage, no kids, and no friends (that I know of). Maybe without me saying anything she’s already suffering. But I also genuinely worry about her becoming a practicing therapist. She’s already a volunteer counselor for dementia patients and also volunteers as a child and family therapist for low-income families. That terrifies me. I’ve had bad therapists before (though never anywhere near this bad), and I always wished someone had intervened before they got licensed.

I felt completely overwhelmed by her, and I’m not even a vulnerable person like a kid, a dementia patient, or a future client. Part of me thinks the best thing I can do is take the high road and not respond to her, but still reach out to her school and volunteer organizations to warn them. I wouldn’t lie or exaggerate—just share what happened and let them decide what to do. That way, I don’t stoop to her level, but I still address what feels like a serious concern.

Sorry this was so long. Should I text her my grievances? Warn her school and volunteer organizations? Do absolutely nothing? Am I completely overreacting? What would you do?",1,1757919622.0,Advice,4,1.0,False

He’s always been a mummy’s boy and we have a really strong bond so I would say he’s always been quite clingy but nothing like this. He just does not leave me alone  not even for 5 mins. I know this is normal and I’m going along with it but it’s so so difficult to do anything, I can’t even drink a coffee, making him lunch or breakfast is an absolute struggle and results in him mostly crying because he wants to be picked up. Before if my husband was home I would get some sort of break but now honestly I don’t think he could care less if he’s home he just comes to me all the time if I leave the room he follows, if I’m just cooking he will come and pull on my leg and cry and moan. 
He’s always been very good at independent play but that’s changed he doesn’t play for longer than a minute now until he comes crawling to me, even if I’m on the mat with him playing he will play and realise I’m there and come to me again. He also used to be good in the pram and loved walks now he starts trying to get out and wants me to pick him up.
I’m sure if he could he would crawl back into my womb right now. He’s recently taken his first steps and is very keen to stand all the time and try to walk so I know he’s probably going through a very big milestone. He’s not teething either. I’m just wondering if anyone else has gone through this and if it eventually gets easier or did it stop? As much as I love him more than anything in the world I would just like 5 mins to myself in the day 😭 I’m always due to go back to work soon and my mum will be looking after him which he has a great bond with but I’m worried if this doesn’t stop how he will cope without me in the day.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

She works as a biomedical engineer in a sterile lab environment, which kinda makes sense with her personality. But honestly, her cleanliness goes to another level. She keeps her toothbrush sealed in a plastic bag in a drawer, showers at least twice a day, and her apartment looks like it’s straight out of a magazine. Even her car looks like it’s never been sat in. She’s basically the human version of a UV sanitizer.



I’m not a slob—I do my dishes, take out the trash, and my place is generally tidy. But Chloe’s standard of clean is… intense. We’ve been talking more about our future lately, and that’s where things got complicated.



Chloe really wants kids. Like, brings-up-baby-names-over-coffee wants kids. And I want them too. But she’s never really been around young children. She seems to think we can raise a kid and still maintain her standard of immaculate cleanliness. She literally told me once, “If you teach them early, they’ll respect their environment.”



Now, I’m the oldest of five and helped raise half my cousins. I’ve changed diapers, been thrown up on, cleaned melted crayon off walls—you name it. Kids are amazing, but they’re also messy. Like, “why-is-there-apple-sauce-in-your-hair” messy.



So I tried to gently explain to her that kids come with messes—like, a lot of them. I brought up blowout diapers, toddler art projects on the furniture, food flung across the room, mysterious sticky spots… you get it. Her response? “That only happens when parents don’t set clear boundaries.”



I told her it’s not about bad parenting—it’s about kids being kids. They spill things. They touch stuff. They’re learning how to exist in the world, and sometimes that means tracking mud all over the floor or painting the dog with yogurt.



She got upset and said I wasn’t supporting her vision of motherhood and accused me of using “hypothetical messes” as an excuse to avoid having kids. Now we’re stuck in this argument where she thinks I’m not taking her side, and I’m wondering if maybe I’m being too pessimistic. Maybe some people really do manage to raise kids in spotless homes? But that hasn’t been my experience.



So, parents of Reddit—AITA here? Is it possible to raise a perfectly clean child, or am I right to tell her she’ll need to relax a little if we start a family?",1,1757919145.0,AmIOverreacting,2,0.67,False

1nheqng,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicforretail/comments/1nheqng/each_to_their_own_music_in_retail_environments/,Each to their own! music in retail environments,"Music in retail is a powerful tool used to shape the customer experience, influence their behavior, and reinforce a brand's identity. The music chosen for a store depends on a variety of factors, including the type of retailer, the target demographic, and the desired atmosphere.



# Luxury Retail: The Sound of Exclusivity



In luxury retail, the goal is to create a refined, unhurried, and exclusive atmosphere. The music is an essential element of this, designed to make customers feel comfortable and to encourage them to take their time browsing.

* **Classical and Instrumental:** Music such as classical piano, string quartets, or instrumental jazz is a common choice. It projects an image of sophistication, quality, and timeless elegance. Research has shown that classical music can even influence customers to perceive products as being more expensive, potentially leading them to make higher-value purchases.
* **Ambient and Nu-Jazz:** For more contemporary luxury brands, downtempo electronic, ambient, and nu-jazz genres are popular. These styles are cool, modern, and non-intrusive, creating a sleek, refined soundscape that complements high-end fashion or technology.



# Fashion and Apparel: A Reflection of the Brand



Fashion retailers use music as a direct extension of their brand's identity. The playlist is carefully curated to appeal to the target demographic and to create an energetic, stimulating, or laid-back vibe, depending on the store's style.

* **Upbeat Pop and Indie Rock:** For fast-fashion or trendy boutiques, upbeat pop and indie rock are common. The high tempo creates a lively atmosphere that encourages quick browsing and impulse purchases.
* **Hip-Hop and R&B:** Urban streetwear or youth-focused brands often use hip-hop and R&B to build a cool, edgy, and culturally relevant atmosphere that resonates with their target audience.
* **Acoustic and Folk:** Bohemian or casual fashion brands may opt for acoustic and folk music. This creates a relaxed, comfortable, and inviting atmosphere, encouraging customers to browse leisurely.



# Grocery and Department Stores: The Soundtrack of Shopping



For large-scale retailers like grocery and department stores, music is used to control the flow and pace of shoppers. The music is generally a broad mix of genres designed to be universally inoffensive and subtly influential.

* **Adult Contemporary and Classic Hits:** The most popular choice, as it appeals to a wide range of ages. Familiar, upbeat, and often nostalgic songs are used to create a cheerful and pleasant atmosphere.
* **Pop and Soft Rock:** Music with a moderate tempo is often preferred to encourage a steady, unhurried shopping pace. A slower tempo can increase ""dwell time""—the amount of time a customer spends in a store—which often leads to higher spending.
* **Seasonal Playlists:** These stores also heavily use seasonal music, such as holiday songs in December, to create a festive mood and encourage gift-buying.



# Bookstores and Cafés: The Sound of Calm



Bookstores and the cafes within them prioritize creating a calm, relaxing, and intellectual environment. The music is meant to encourage customers to slow down, browse, and stay a while.

* **Jazz and Classical Piano:** These genres are excellent for a quiet, contemplative atmosphere. They fill the silence without being a distraction, allowing customers to focus on reading or working.
* **Acoustic and Ambient:** Gentle, instrumental, and lo-fi music is a popular choice for its ability to create a cozy and calm soundscape. It's the perfect backdrop for browsing bookshelves or enjoying a coffee.



# Convenience Stores: The Sound of Speed



In convenience stores, the musical strategy is the opposite of fine dining or bookstores. The goal is to facilitate quick, efficient purchases.

* **Upbeat, Familiar Pop:** The music in a convenience store is often upbeat and easily recognizable. The fast tempo is designed to match the desired speed of customer turnover. It keeps the energy high and encourages customers to make their purchases and move on quickly.



# The Business of Music Licensing in Retail



Regardless of the type of retailer, it is a **legal requirement** to have a proper license to play music in a commercial space. A personal subscription to a streaming service like Spotify or Apple Music is for personal use only and does not cover public performance.

1nheqkl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1nheqkl/moved_to_a_new_country_feel_completely_alone_cant/,"Moved to a new country, feel completely alone, can't seem to get a win. Getting older as a woman really makes you feel invisible.","My husband and I moved to a foreign country about three years ago because I got a great job offer in an industry that is practically dead in our home country. I do not regret the move because financially, it was definitely the right decision for us--however, I've really been struggling with the social aspect of it. I've been feeling really depressed lately and just can't seem to get a win.  
  
In our home town (which was a big metropolitan city), I wasn't the biggest social animal, but I reliably had multiple groups of friends I could hit up to spend time with when I felt the urge to go out. My industry was small and niche, which meant everyone knew everyone, and I was respected for the work I had been known to do. I went to college in this city, built my entire adult life in this city... and I guess I really took that for granted.

I didn't feel super lonely the first year we moved. We were having lots of adventures, exploring our new country, dealing with immigration... Then, last year, I had a bit of a falling out with my main formal friend group over a political stance (relating to feminism) I *thought* we all had in common. Suddenly, it hit me how alone I really was in this new country; the messages in the group chat with old friends across the globe had given me enough of an illusion of a social life that wasn't really true. My job is also completely remote and for a pretty small company, and while my industry is doing better here than in my home country, it's still quite isolated, so it's not easy to find people to connect and find each other.

Instead of wallowing around, I've been trying my absolute hardest to push myself out of my comfort zone and meet new people in this city. It's a much smaller city, and I have somewhat ""unconventional"" interests for my age/gender demographic (or at least, it seems like I do considering how hard it's been to find other people like me to talk to). I'm a woman in my early 30s who's *really* into retro gaming, film (especially older films) and anime, but also care a lot about feminism, story/film theory and critical conversations around art, which... makes finding community very difficult, even online.  

I've attended multiple ""meetup"" events surrounding various interests and either end up in situations where I am the only woman, or the majority of the attendees are 10 years younger than me, or the vibes are generally just not what I'm looking for.

I attended one today that I thought was a perfect match. It was a meetup for playing social deduction board games, which I had never played before. I had a *really* great time, thought I connected with the group, we all laughed and even played an extra round over our scheduled time because we didn't want to stop! I left feeling really good about what happened and super eager to attend the next game, and we even discussed as a group hosting it at my place the next time instead of the local coffee shop because it was super close by and there'd be more room. One of the members even grabbed my email to invite me to his place the next time he hosted a board game night! 

A few hours after I get home, I get a message from the group leader saying that they don't think my ""play style"" is a right match for the group and I wouldn't be welcomed back. I was completely flabbergasted by this, because I was under *no* impression whatsoever that I was causing any trouble to the group at *all*, and in fact got the opposite impression! I've been picking apart my behavior basically line by line, trying to understand where I went wrong, and the only thing I can think of is that *possibly* I was too enthusiastic? I got too ""into"" the game? But other people were being really loud and passionate too, and I thought I was just matching the energy... 

I try not to make things gendered arbitrarily, but I couldn't help but to feel like it kind of was in this case. Besides me, only two other women were in the game, and they both had slightly 'meeker"" play styles, in that they didn't really speak until spoken to. This worked out really well for one of them when they got an evil role, so definitely a valid strategy! The rest of the group was made up of 7 men, the majority of whom largely dominated the conversation--to the point where it was often hard to get a word in over them. My first two games, I was given ""investigation"" roles, which meant I had a lot of information, so I was trying to convey this information to my teammates and gather more of it where I could. I was basically following the lead of the men in the group; trying to be proactive, trying to help solve the mysteries, and engaging in playful competitiveness when appropriate. Multiple times in my life, I've been told (as an insult) my personality is ""assertive,"" ""masculine"" and ""unfeminine."" Maybe it's unrelated, but it really felt like being singled out in this way reiterated these insults I have received over my life, when I was just mirroring the way the majority of the other (male) players were playing.  
  
And so, I've just been crying all night because I just feel like... kind of at the end of my rope in regards to trying to build a new social life here, online or in person. I wonder sometimes if I were still a 20 year old, or if I were just a man instead, if it would be easier for me. My husband has had such an easy time finding and making friends here (he's into video games, Warhammer, DnD, and has had no issue finding peers in his age group to hang out with). It makes me feel like something is inherently wrong with me, and I just am starting to feel hopeless. I don't feel like I can find community online, and I'm also too mortified to try going to anymore ""meetup"" type things lest an embarrassment like today happen again... so what else is there left for me to do?",3,1757918876.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

I know TDS doesn’t tell the whole story of flavor, but I’ve heard that with today’s higher-quality coffees, people are often aiming for higher TDS than in the past. That made me wonder what the modern “baseline” is.

Traditionally, SCA suggested 1.15–1.35% as the ideal range for drip/pourover. But obviously it depends on brew ratio, grind, and technique:
	•	Larger brew ratio → lower TDS (more diluted)
	•	Smaller brew ratio → higher TDS (stronger cup)

Roast degree complicates things, too:
	•	Darker roasts: fewer solubles overall, but they extract more easily
	•	Lighter roasts: more potential solubles, but harder to extract

So my questions are:
👉 Do darker roasts usually end up with higher TDS in practice?
👉 Or do people typically adjust dose for darker roasts to keep things balanced?

And more broadly, what ranges are you aiming for these days with high-quality light roasts?

✨ I’d also love it if as many people as possible could share their current brew parameters and target TDS — would be great to see the variety of approaches!",1,1757918055.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Espresso lovers know the rich, bold flavor is unmatched. But not everyone has an espresso machine at home. The good news? You don’t need one to enjoy a strong, delicious espresso. With a few simple tools and some patience, you can brew a cup that rivals any café.

This guide will show you how to do it right. Get ready to impress yourself and your friends with your homemade espresso skills. Let’s dive into the process and make some great coffee!

# Espresso Basics

Espresso is a strong and concentrated coffee enjoyed by many around the world. Making espresso at home without a machine can be challenging but is possible. Understanding the basics of espresso is crucial before diving into the process. This guide will help you learn what espresso is and the key ingredients needed to make a perfect cup.

# What Is Espresso?

Espresso is a type of coffee brewed by forcing a small amount of nearly boiling water through finely-ground coffee beans. It is known for its rich flavor and thick consistency. It is the base for many popular coffee drinks like lattes, cappuccinos, and macchiatos.

**Key characteristics of espresso include:**

* **Strong flavor:** Espresso has a more intense flavor compared to regular coffee.
* **Small serving size:** Typically served in small quantities, usually 1-2 ounces.
* **Crema:** A golden layer of foam on top, indicating a well-made espresso.
* **Quick brewing time:** Takes about 25-30 seconds to brew.

Espresso is enjoyed by itself or as a base for other drinks. Knowing these characteristics helps you understand what makes espresso unique and why it is loved by coffee enthusiasts.

# Key Ingredients

Making espresso requires just a few ingredients, but each plays a vital role in achieving the perfect cup. The primary ingredients include:

* **Coffee beans:** Use high-quality, dark roast coffee beans. Freshly ground beans are essential for the best flavor.
* **Water:** Use filtered water to avoid impurities that can affect the taste.

**Details on the ingredients:**

|Ingredient|Description|
|:-|:-|
|Coffee Beans|Choose a dark roast for a rich, bold flavor. Grind them just before brewing.|
|Water|Filtered water enhances the taste and quality of the espresso.|

Aside from the primary ingredients, you might need some additional tools like a grinder, kettle, and a method to apply pressure to the coffee grounds. These tools help replicate the pressure and temperature needed for a good espresso.

# Essential Equipment

Making espresso without a machine might seem challenging, but with the right tools, it’s quite achievable. Having the essential equipment can make all the difference in brewing a perfect cup of espresso. This guide will help you understand what you need to get started.

# Manual Methods

For those who prefer a hands-on approach, there are several manual methods to make espresso. Each method requires specific equipment and a bit of practice, but the results can be just as satisfying as using a machine.

Here are some popular manual methods:

* **Aeropress:** This versatile tool can make a strong, espresso-like coffee. You will need an Aeropress, coffee beans, grinder, and hot water. Simply grind your coffee beans to a fine consistency, place the Aeropress over a mug, add the coffee, pour hot water, and press down slowly.
* **Moka Pot:** Also known as a stovetop espresso maker, the Moka Pot uses steam pressure to brew coffee. You need a Moka Pot, finely ground coffee, and a heat source. Fill the bottom chamber with water, add coffee to the filter basket, assemble the pot, and heat it on the stove until coffee starts to fill the top chamber.
* **French Press:** While not traditional for espresso, the French Press can make a concentrated coffee if used correctly. Use a French Press, coffee beans, grinder, and hot water. Grind the coffee beans finely, add them to the French Press, pour hot water, stir, and steep for about 4 minutes before pressing down the plunger.

These manual methods require attention to detail and patience. Practice makes perfect, and soon you’ll enjoy a rich, homemade espresso.

# Alternative Tools

Beyond manual methods, several alternative tools can help you make espresso without a machine. These tools are often more portable and affordable, making them great options for coffee enthusiasts on a budget.

Consider these alternative tools:

* **Handheld Espresso Makers:** These devices are compact and easy to use. They require ground coffee, hot water, and manual pressure. Examples include the Wacaco Nanopresso and STARESSO.
* **Espresso Pods:** Some brands offer espresso pods that can be used without a machine. These pods contain pre-ground coffee and can be steeped in hot water for a quick espresso-like drink.
* **Manual Lever Machines:** These machines use a lever to create pressure for brewing espresso. They are more traditional and require some skill, but they can produce excellent results. Popular models include the Flair Espresso Maker and the Rok EspressoGC.

Each of these tools has its advantages and can suit different preferences and lifestyles. Whether you’re camping, traveling, or just don’t want to invest in a full espresso machine, these alternatives offer a practical solution for making espresso at home.

# Grinding Coffee

Making espresso without a machine might seem challenging, but with the right technique, you can enjoy a rich, flavorful shot at home. One of the most critical steps in this process is grinding your coffee. The grind size and the type of grinder you use can significantly impact the taste and quality of your espresso. Let’s delve into the importance of grind size and the recommended grinders for making espresso.

# Importance Of Grind Size

The grind size is crucial when making espresso. It affects the extraction rate and the flavor profile of your coffee. A fine grind is necessary for espresso because it increases the surface area of the coffee, allowing for a quicker and more efficient extraction.

Here are some reasons why grind size is important:

* **Extraction Time:** A fine grind allows water to pass through the coffee grounds more slowly, ensuring a proper extraction time of about 25-30 seconds.
* **Flavor Balance:** The correct grind size helps in achieving a balanced flavor. Too coarse, and your espresso will taste weak and under-extracted. Too fine, and it can be bitter and over-extracted.
* **Consistency:** Consistent grind size ensures that each particle extracts at the same rate, providing a uniform taste.

A simple way to test your grind size is by examining the coffee puck after brewing. A well-extracted puck should be even and slightly firm.

# Recommended Grinders

Choosing the right grinder is essential for achieving the perfect grind size. Here are some recommended grinders for making espresso without a machine:

1. **Burr Grinders:** These grinders are preferred for espresso because they provide a consistent grind size. Burr grinders crush the beans between two abrasive surfaces, which can be adjusted to achieve the desired fineness.
   * **Manual Burr Grinder:** Affordable and portable. Great for beginners.
   * **Electric Burr Grinder:** Offers convenience and consistency. Ideal for regular use.
2. **Blade Grinders:** These grinders use a rotating blade to chop the beans. They are less expensive but can produce an uneven grind.
   * **Electric Blade Grinder:** Quick and easy. Best for those on a budget.

Here’s a comparison table to help you choose:

|Grinder Type|Pros|Cons|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Manual Burr Grinder|Affordable, Portable, Consistent|Time-consuming, Manual Effort Required|
|Electric Burr Grinder|Consistent, Convenient, Adjustable|Expensive, Requires Electricity|
|Electric Blade Grinder|Quick, Affordable|Inconsistent, Uneven Grind|

Investing in a good grinder can make a significant difference in the quality of your homemade espresso. Choose one that fits your budget and meets your needs.

# Brewing Techniques

Making espresso without a machine may seem challenging, but there are simple and effective brewing techniques that can deliver a rich, flavorful shot of espresso. Whether you’re a coffee enthusiast or just curious, these methods can help you enjoy a delightful cup of espresso with minimal equipment. Let’s explore two popular techniques: the Stovetop Moka Pot and the French Press Method.

# Stovetop Moka Pot

The Stovetop Moka Pot is a classic method for brewing espresso-like coffee at home. It’s a three-chambered pot that uses steam pressure to brew coffee. Here’s how to use it:

* **Step 1:** Fill the bottom chamber with water up to the safety valve.
* **Step 2:** Insert the filter basket and fill it with finely ground coffee. Do not tamp the coffee; just level it off.
* **Step 3:** Assemble the Moka Pot by screwing the top and bottom chambers together.
* **Step 4:** Place the Moka Pot on medium heat.
* **Step 5:** Wait for the coffee to start bubbling up into the top chamber. This should take about 5-10 minutes.
* **Step 6:** Once you hear a hissing sound, remove the pot from the heat to avoid over-extraction.

The resulting coffee will be strong and concentrated, similar to espresso. The Moka Pot is a favorite due to its simplicity and the rich flavor it produces.

# French Press Method

The French Press is another versatile tool that can be used to make espresso-like coffee. Though it’s traditionally used for regular coffee, with a few adjustments, you can achieve a strong, espresso-style brew.

* **Step 1:** Heat water to just below boiling, around 200°F (93°C).
* **Step 2:** Grind your coffee beans to a fine consistency. Use about 2 tablespoons of coffee per 4 ounces of water.
* **Step 3:** Add the ground coffee to the French Press.
* **Step 4:** Pour the hot water over the coffee grounds, ensuring all grounds are saturated.
* **Step 5:** Stir the mixture gently to ensure even extraction.
* **Step 6:** Place the lid on the French Press with the plunger pulled up.
* **Step 7:** Let the coffee steep for about 4 minutes.
* **Step 8:** Slowly press the plunger down to separate the grounds from the brewed coffee.

The French Press method yields a robust and full-bodied coffee that mimics espresso. It’s a great alternative if you don’t have a Moka Pot or espresso machine.

# Water Quality

Making espresso without a machine might seem challenging, but it is possible with the right techniques. One key aspect is the quality of the water you use. Good water can make a significant difference in the taste of your espresso. Let’s dive into the details.

# Choosing The Right Water

Choosing the right water for your espresso is crucial. **Water quality can affect the flavor and aroma** of your coffee. Here are some tips to ensure you use the best water:

* **Filtered Water**: Use water that has been filtered to remove impurities. This helps in avoiding any off-flavors.
* **Mineral Content**: Water with too many minerals can make your espresso taste bitter. Use water with moderate mineral content for the best results.
* **Avoid Distilled Water**: Distilled water lacks minerals which are necessary for extracting the flavors from coffee grounds.

To help you understand better, here’s a simple table showing the ideal mineral content for espresso water:

|Mineral|Ideal Range (mg/L)|
|:-|:-|
|Calcium|17-85|
|Magnesium|4-30|
|Sodium|10|

**pH Level**: The pH level of water should be neutral, around 7. Water that is too acidic or too alkaline can affect the extraction process.

By using the right water, you ensure that your espresso is rich and flavorful.

# Temperature Considerations

The temperature of the water is another vital factor. **Water temperature affects how well the coffee grounds are extracted**. Here’s what you need to know:

* **Ideal Temperature**: The best temperature for brewing espresso is between 195°F and 205°F (90°C to 96°C).
* **Consistency**: Keep the temperature consistent to ensure uniform extraction.
* **Boiling Water**: Avoid using boiling water (212°F or 100°C). It can scald the coffee grounds, leading to a burnt taste.

Here’s a quick guide for checking water temperature:

1. Boil the water and let it sit for 30 seconds to cool down slightly.
2. Use a thermometer to check the temperature. Aim for the ideal range.
3. Adjust as needed to maintain consistency.

Maintaining the right temperature helps in achieving a balanced and smooth espresso. **Too hot or too cold water can lead to poor extraction**.

Remember, great espresso starts with great water. Focus on these factors, and you will notice a significant improvement in your homemade espresso.

# Extracting Espresso

Making espresso without a machine might seem challenging, but it’s possible with the right techniques. Extracting espresso involves creating pressure and timing the brew perfectly. Let’s explore these methods to make a rich and flavorful espresso at home.

# Pressure Techniques

Creating the right pressure is essential for extracting espresso. Without a machine, you can use alternative methods to achieve the desired pressure. Here are a few effective techniques:

* **Aeropress:** This tool uses manual pressure to force hot water through the coffee grounds. Place a filter in the Aeropress cap, add coffee grounds, pour hot water, and press down slowly.
* **Moka Pot:** Known as a stovetop espresso maker, the Moka Pot uses steam pressure. Fill the bottom chamber with water, add coffee grounds in the filter basket, and heat until the top chamber fills with coffee.
* **French Press:** Though not traditional, a French Press can mimic espresso. Use fine grounds, pour hot water, stir, and press down the plunger slowly.

Each method has its unique approach to creating pressure. It’s crucial to use fine coffee grounds and hot water to ensure a strong brew. Experiment with these techniques to find the one that suits your taste.

# Timing The Brew

Timing is critical in making a good espresso. The extraction process should be controlled to avoid over or under-extraction. Here’s how to time your brew:

1. **Heating:** Preheat your tools, including the cup, to maintain the temperature. This step ensures even extraction.
2. **Pouring:** When using an Aeropress, pour hot water slowly over the grounds. For a Moka Pot, wait until the water boils and starts moving through the coffee.
3. **Extraction Time:** Aim for a total extraction time of 25-30 seconds. This timing is crucial for a balanced flavor. Start your timer as soon as you begin pouring hot water.
4. **Finishing:** Stop the process immediately when the time is up. Over-extraction can make your espresso bitter.

By controlling the timing, you can extract the best flavors from your coffee grounds. Practice makes perfect, so keep adjusting your timing until you achieve the ideal taste.

# Tasting Notes

Espresso is a beloved beverage, known for its rich, concentrated flavor. Making espresso without a machine may seem daunting, but it is possible. Understanding the tasting notes is essential to mastering this technique. Tasting notes help identify the unique flavors and aromas in your homemade espresso.

# Flavor Profile

Homemade espresso can vary in flavor. The key is to balance the various elements. Let’s break down the flavor profile of a well-made espresso:

* **Bitterness:** A slight bitterness is expected, but it should not overpower. It comes from the coffee beans’ natural oils.
* **Sweetness:** Good espresso has a natural sweetness. It balances the bitterness and acidity.
* **Acidity:** Acidity adds a bright and tangy note. It should be crisp, not sour.
* **Body:** The body is the mouthfeel of the espresso. A full-bodied espresso feels rich and creamy on the tongue.

These elements create a complex and enjoyable cup. To achieve the best flavor profile, consider these tips:

1. **Use fresh, high-quality beans:** Freshly roasted beans yield better flavors.
2. **Grind consistency:** A fine, uniform grind is crucial for extracting the right flavors.
3. **Water temperature:** Ideal water temperature is between 195°F and 205°F (90°C to 96°C).
4. **Brew time:** Aim for a brew time of around 25-30 seconds.

Paying attention to these factors helps create a balanced and flavorful espresso.

# Common Mistakes

Many beginners make mistakes when making espresso without a machine. Here are some common errors and how to avoid them:

* **Using stale beans:** Stale beans produce a flat and dull taste. Always use fresh beans.
* **Incorrect grind size:** Too coarse or too fine a grind can ruin the extraction. Stick to a fine, consistent grind.
* **Improper tamping:** Uneven tamping leads to uneven extraction. Apply even pressure when tamping the grounds.
* **Wrong water temperature:** Water that’s too hot or too cold affects the flavor. Keep it between 195°F and 205°F (90°C to 96°C).
* **Over-extraction:** Brewing for too long makes the espresso bitter. Keep the brew time within 25-30 seconds.

These mistakes are easy to make, but they are also easy to correct. Here is a quick reference table for common mistakes and solutions:

|Mistake|Solution|
|:-|:-|
|Stale beans|Use freshly roasted beans|
|Incorrect grind size|Grind to a fine, consistent size|
|Improper tamping|Tamp evenly with consistent pressure|
|Wrong water temperature|Use water between 195°F and 205°F (90°C to 96°C)|
|Over-extraction|Limit brew time to 25-30 seconds|

Being mindful of these common mistakes helps improve the quality of your homemade espresso. Paying attention to detail ensures a better-tasting cup every time.

\[It’s easy. If you’re close with the couple, just invite them on a trip.\]

\[Get them drunk at night, then ‘accidentally’ end up in her husband’s room. Boom, done.\]

\[Afterward, show him a positive test and pressure him to step up and claim the baby…\]

I let out a disbelieving laugh, heat prickling under my skin. I was about to send the post to my best friend so we could roast it when Sarah looked up from her plate.

“Hey, Lily, you free this weekend?” she asked. “How about a trip?”

I froze.

“A trip?” I raised a brow. “Where did that come from? Isn’t a weekend kind of rushed?”

Sarah and I had been friends since college. We usually planned trips over long breaks; this was out of the blue, and two days barely covered the travel time.

She grinned like it was nothing. “I was just scrolling X and saw there’s an EDM festival in Las Vegas this weekend. Come on, Lily—we haven’t had fun in forever. Work’s been grinding us down. Let’s blow off some steam.”

I hesitated, nudging my food around. “I don’t know… Let me think it over tonight,” I said after a beat. “I don’t have plans this weekend, but I promised Ethan I’d run things by him. He gets anxious if I don’t.”

At the mention of my husband, Sarah’s eyes lit for a split second. Then she flashed a bright smile. “Easy fix—bring Ethan. It’ll be even safer with him there.”

Before I could answer, she pulled out her phone and opened Ticketmaster.

Unease slid under my ribs. A trip. The three of us. The timing. It looked a little too much like that post.

I watched Sarah tapping away, her face bright with excitement. A wild thought flickered: What if she was the one who posted it?

I shook my head at myself. No way. The world wasn’t that small. We’d been friends for five years. I knew her. She wouldn’t do something like that.

I took a breath, talked myself down, and told her to go ahead and buy the tickets.

A minute later, Sarah excused herself to the bathroom. As she stood, a waiter carrying a tray came up beside her. She didn’t see him, and they collided.

My heart stopped for a beat.

Sarah’s hands flew to her belly, shielding it on instinct.

A chill raced over my skin.

Was Sarah… pregnant?

Was she really the one who wrote that post?

Chapter 2 As soon as Sarah slipped away to the bathroom, I seized the chance to open the post I’d been reading. The original poster had updated it only seconds earlier.

\[Score — I got her to agree! I told her to bring her husband, and she didn’t hesitate to say yes. Lucky we were so close—she didn’t suspect a thing. \]

My stomach dropped.

I scrolled down and saw a handful of new replies. After Sarah’s comment, the people who had been quietly following the thread finally spoke up. Several jumped in and tore into her.

“\[ou’re supposed to be her friend, and you’re scheming like this? Are you even human?\]

\[Running into someone like you is the worst luck. I hope your friend sees this and learns who you really are. Gross.\]

\[Don’t push this kind of trash my way again — I’m so mad I’m going to get an ulcer! Dumbass!\]

But the poster didn’t flinch; she shot back at every critic.

\[You weren’t in my shoes. If you were, you’d have done the same thing.\]

\[I just can’t stand it. Why should some small-town nobody get to marry a city guy? She’s not as pretty as me, her family isn’t as good as mine—how is she worthy of her husband?\]

\[Anyway, I’m going to ruin her. If I can’t have what I want, she doesn’t get to live happily either. I can’t wait to see her face when her husband betrays her.\]

\[Haha, it’ll be epic. She’ll end up alone and unwanted.\]

The more I read, the colder the room felt. There was no denying it—this poster was Sarah.

She had said it herself: I’d come from a small town. I was the only kid from my hometown who’d made it to college.

That background had left me feeling inferior through university; I’d kept to myself and didn’t have many friends.

Sarah had been the one who reached out—the one who stuck with me through freshman year, through graduation, and into these early years at work. I’d trusted her more than anyone.

I hadn’t expected her to be capable of something so dark. That she could look down on me and want to destroy my happiness—knowing all that—felt like a punch to the ribs.

My hands began to tremble around the phone.

Sarah stopped replying to the commenters. I realized she might be coming back.

I shoved the phone into my pocket, drew a slow breath, and smoothed my expression until it was neutral. I’d made up my mind. I wasn’t just going to decline her weekend invitation—I was done with her. For good.

She returned from the bathroom and slid back into her seat across from me, smiling.

“Lily, I already bought your ticket. I just need your husband’s email for his e-ticket and I’ll buy his now. Don’t worry about the cost — I’ve got it covered. Consider it my treat for you two coming with me.”

Her smile was bright. To me, it looked like a challenge, sharp at the edges.

I swallowed the anger bubbling beneath my ribs and forced my voice calm. “Sarah, you should refund the ticket. I’m not going.”

“What?” Her voice shot up before I could finish, loud enough that a few heads turned. She coughed and softened it immediately. “I mean… what? You’re bailing now? That’s so sudden.”

I put on an apologetic look.

“Sorry, I thought about it. The timing’s tight, and I’ve got a huge project that’s piling up — I’ll probably need to work through the weekend. Let’s plan a paid vacation later, when things settle down. For now, maybe find someone else to go with.”

Her smile dropped. Irritation slipped over her face. “But we already agreed. I bought the ticket, Lily. You can’t just back out now—that’s unfair.”

“I don’t care,” she added quickly, like a petulant command. “You’re coming with me this weekend, no excuses.”

In the past, whenever Sarah sulked or threw a fit, I had always been the one to give in.

If she wanted something, I found a way to make it happen; she was my best friend, after all. Now, knowing what I knew, I felt foolish for five years.

I forced a bitter little smile and kept eating, eyes on my plate.

Sarah fidgeted, anxious at my silence. She opened her mouth to say more, but I grabbed a napkin, wiped my lips, and stood up before she could speak.

“Sorry, Sarah, it’s getting late. My husband’s waiting for me. I have to go.” I offered a conciliatory smile. “I’ll make it up to you next time.”

I didn’t wait for her response. I turned and walked out—quick, deliberate steps—and I didn’t look back at her expression.

When I got home and opened X, a notification popped up: Sarah had posted again.

Chapter 3 I stared at my phone, thumb hovering, as Sarah’s latest post blew up with comments.

She’d posted that she’d backed out and was begging for help — the kind of panicked post that begged attention.

Underneath the flood of replies, one commenter stood out: the same person who’d given advice earlier.

The person asked, bluntly, whether Sarah really needed her best friend to step in this time. Couldn’t she find someone else?

Sarah’s answer landed like a blow. She wrote that there was no way — she was going to steal her friend’s husband.

She said she wanted to ruin her happiness.

She went on: at lunch that day the woman had kept bringing up her husband, and it had made Sarah sick. She wanted to see her cry, to watch her break.

My stomach turned. Whatever thin strand of affection I’d still had for my so-called best friend snapped in that instant.

Then the commenter went quiet. A minute later I noticed they’d taken the thread to private messages.

After my shower I checked Sarah’s post again. Her tone had flipped to smug. \[It’s done,\] she’d written. \[I got her. I’ll bring good news to you all this weekend.\]

Confusion prickled at me — had she switched targets?

Before I could sort it out, my phone started buzzing. A dozen Messenger notifications from Ethan. I’d been so wrapped up in Sarah’s feed that I hadn’t noticed.

I opened the chat. He’d sent a screenshot with a string of messages: \[Babe, what’s going on? Why’s Sarah asking me for my email?\]

\[She said you wanted to go to the EDM festival — is that true? You didn’t reply and she kept harassing me, so I gave it to her.\]

……

I felt cold. Sarah had gone around me and messaged Ethan directly — and she’d lied. I was furious.

I was about to call him and demand answers when I heard the front door open. Ethan was home.

I didn’t try to hide it. “Why would you agree to anything she said without checking with me first?” I asked in the living room.

He looked surprised and a little wounded. “You always trusted her, didn’t you?” he said.

“Sometimes it feels like you two are the couple, not us. You always take her side. She was blowing up my phone and you weren’t answering, so I figured it was okay.”

His words stung, but they weren’t wrong.

For five years I’d trusted Sarah blindly. When we traveled she’d set the budget and I’d Venmo her without question. At work, if she wanted a project I’d give it up without complaint just to keep the peace.

Thinking back on all those small concessions, I felt my stomach churn again — maybe my blind trust had made her feel she could do anything.

I told Ethan everything: the post, the hateful things she’d written, that she seemed intent on destroying us.

His face darkened with each detail. Without hesitation he pulled out his phone and blocked Sarah in front of me.

“If it wasn’t for you, I wouldn’t even have her contact,” he said, jaw tight.

“Tell her the festival’s off. I’m done with her. And you…” His gaze softened but stayed firm. “You’ve seen who she really is now. Stay away from her. No more contact.”

I nodded. My resolve hardened.

I opened my messages to Sarah and sent a short, final reply: \[I wasn’t going.\]

She answered immediately, slipping into her usual act.

\[Lily, please,\] she wrote. \[I’m desperate. I can’t go alone. I just wanted Ethan to talk you into coming — the three of us would have fun. I couldn’t find anyone else. Come on, have a heart.\]

I scoffed, my patience gone. I blocked her back.

The next morning at work, my boss, Luke Connor called everyone together and announced, casually, “Heads up — we have a team-building retreat this Friday and Saturday.”

Chapter 4 At first, I didn’t think much of it. Last week Luke had mentioned a company team-building outing. I just hadn’t expected it to fall on Friday and Saturday of the same week.

When Luke briefly described the destination, he flashed a grin. “We’re going to a resort this time,” he said. “We’ll be teamed up with another department for the activities.”

He chuckled. “The company doesn’t have an explicit policy forbidding office romances, so if you’ve got your eye on someone in another department, this is a good chance to mix and meet.”

Then he looked at me. “Lily, you’re lucky — you can go with your husband and take a company-paid trip.”

His words made me frown. I couldn’t help glancing at Sarah Mitchell, my so-called best friend. She was already looking back. In that instant our eyes locked and I saw a flash of smug satisfaction, as if she’d just pulled off some elaborate scheme.

No way. Could she have had something to do with pairing my husband’s department with ours?

After Luke finished and everyone returned to their desks, I opened the thread I hadn’t checked in a couple of days. Nearly five hundred new comments had been posted.

I scrolled through them, my anger building with every line. People were offering advice.

\[If they’re not willing to go, find a way to make them have to,\] one commenter said.

Another wrote, \[Tell us more about your situation and I’ll help you come up with a plan.\]

Sarah had laid out the details.

\[We work in the same company and same department,\] she wrote. \[Her husband is in a different department. The company is planning a team-building event — could that be my chance?\]

The thread exploded. \[Yes! Absolutely!\] someone answered. \[Team-building is perfect. Everyone will know if you hook up — how could he not take responsibility after that?\]

\[But team-building is so random,\] Sarah worried in the thread. \[There will be tons of people and departments — I might not even get a chance to talk to him…\]

\[Don’t be dense,\] another commenter shot back. \[Team-building events are organized by someone. Find out who’s in charge of arranging groups and cozy up to them. See if you can get put in the same group.\]

To break the ice, the company randomly pairs two departments to form a team each time, competing against other departments in team vs. team games during corporate events.

I kept scrolling until I hit Sarah’s follow-ups.

\[Thanks, babes!\] she wrote. \[I tracked down the HR person organizing the event and brought her a coffee. I said there was someone I liked in that department and asked if she could pair us together — she said yes!\]

A moment later she added, \[Plan is moving along. Just got word — I’m in the same group as her husband’s department! Wait for my good news, everyone!\]

Sarah was humming a cheerful tune across the room, completely oblivious to the storm boiling inside me. A cold fury settled over me.

I stood up and marched to Luke’s office. “Luke,” I said, forcing my voice steady, “can I skip this team-building event?”

Chapter 5 Luke shot down my request without hesitation. He even sent a announcement stressing that everyone had to attend the team-building retreat unless they had a valid reason.

With no other choice, I reluctantly agreed.

On Friday morning, we left the office. Once we arrived at the retreat, everyone headed straight to the hotel to check into their rooms. Ethan and I were assigned to the same room.

After dropping off our luggage, I stepped out and almost ran into Sarah Mitchell.

She was standing outside my door, fixated on the room number. The moment she noticed me, she quickly looked away, then brightened and grabbed my hand.

“Lily, are you still mad at me?” she pouted playfully. “I messed up, okay? Can you forgive me?”

Ever since I’d blocked her, Sarah had been clinging to me at work, constantly trying to smooth things over. The second we got off the bus today, she’d rushed over, apologizing nonstop.

If I didn’t soften, I worried she’d start sensing something was off.

So I turned my head, pretending to still be upset. “So you finally admit you were wrong?”

Seeing me soften, Sarah seized the moment. “I swear I didn’t mean it! I just really wanted to go.”

“I won’t push you anymore,” she added quickly. “If you don’t want to, that’s fine.”

I sighed heavily, pretending to give in reluctantly. “Fine. But there better not be a next time.”

Sarah nodded eagerly, her face lighting up.

Then came her real agenda.

She leaned in closer, her voice soft and almost pitiful.

“Since you’ve forgiven me, Lily… can we sleep in the same room tonight? I’ve never been good at sleeping alone, and you barely talked to me these past few days. Just keep me company, okay?”

Her grip on my arm was gentle but persuasive.

But my mind was elsewhere, replaying the post I’d just seen. Earlier in the room, I’d opened the app and noticed Sarah had posted an update:

\[Just arrived at the retreat! What should I do next? Any advice?\]

Some creep online had replied:

\[Is your bestie sharing a room with her husband? If so, find an excuse to get her to sleep with you instead.\]

\[That way, you can separate them. Get everyone drunk tonight, and when no one’s paying attention, sneak into her husband’s room. That’ll do the trick. After that, it’s all up to you!\]

Sarah had eagerly liked the comment and even promised a cash reward if the plan worked.

Sure enough, not long after, she appeared at my door—first softening me with apologies, then moving straight to her scheme.

Meeting her pleading gaze, a sudden idea sparked in my mind. If Sarah was willing to throw away our friendship and ruin my happiness, I’d make her taste regret herself.

I kept my expression calm, though inside I was smirking. I placed my hand over hers and patted it lightly. “Alright,” I said softly. “We can sleep in the same room tonight.”

“Really?!” Sarah’s eyes lit up. She hadn’t expected such an easy agreement.

She chattered excitedly as we headed downstairs together. On the hotel patio, everyone had gathered for a barbecue.

My eyes scanned the crowd and landed on a greasy, pot-bellied man in the corner—Timmy Brooks.

Timmy was a colleague from my department.

Older, unkempt, and with a reputation for harassing younger women, he’d made several uncomfortable advances toward Sarah. She’d once complained that his leering gaze made her skin crawl.

In my book, Timmy was trouble.

Just an hour ago, he’d approached me about swapping rooms.

“Lily, you and Ethan are sharing a room, right? Any chance you could switch with me?”

I frowned. “Why? Is something wrong with your room? Can’t you just ask the front desk?”

He scratched his greasy hair awkwardly.

“Nah… it’s too big. I prefer smaller rooms, but the front desk says they’re out. No one else wants to swap with me. But you and Ethan? That big room’s perfect for you two, right?”

At the time, we’d turned him down.

But now? Things had changed.

Let the creeps sort it out among themselves, I thought. I wanted to see Sarah’s face when she woke up in Timmy’s bed.

So I walked over to Timmy, flashing a friendly smile. “Hey, Tim, still want to swap rooms? I talked it over with Ethan, and we’re fine with it.”",1,1757917469.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

However - I’ve changed my job role and now cook 8hrs a day 6 days a week (have my own business and the previous cook has left) and its killing ANY appetite i had completely! Between stress of sorting out the business staffing, working stupid amounts of hours cause i have all the other stuff to do on top of running the kitchen, i’m forgetting to eat all, running on coffee, water and the odd protein shake/drink if i remember. 

Yet the scales haven’t moved in 10days!! Pretty sure my body has gone into starvation mode (no lectures about that not being a thing please - its simply the easiest description for how i’m feeling physically!) 

Any suggestions to help me navigate this while i hunt for staff - cause think its gonna be a while cause got a lot to fix and get back on track. But i’m not gonna last without some kinda plan in place 🤯🤯

I tried most of it, but honestly? It never stuck.

What finally worked for me was embarrassingly simple. Nothing Instagram-worthy, but it cut almost an hour of wasted time out of my mornings:

1. **No phone for the first 30 minutes** I used to lose 20–25 minutes scrolling before even getting out of bed. Now I leave my phone charging in the next room and use a cheap alarm clock. The difference is huge.
2. **Batch the basics** Instead of making tiny decisions every morning (what to wear, what to eat, what bag to pack), I set up a “default.” Same breakfast (overnight oats), clothes picked the night before, bag ready at the door. Saves me at least 15 minutes of dithering.
3. **Timers for transitions** Brushing teeth, making coffee, quick stretch.  I set a 5-minute timer for each. Weirdly, it keeps me from drifting into daydreaming or standing around.
4. **First task = one small win** I don’t start with email. Instead, I write down one 5-minute task (like clearing my desk or reviewing today’s top 3 priorities). It creates momentum instead of dragging me into other people’s agendas.

**Result:** I went from needing about 2 hours to “start my day” to 1 hour. That extra hour now goes into focused work before distractions hit, and it feels like I’m finally ahead instead of playing catch-up.

Not glamorous. Not aesthetic. But it works for me.

Curious, what is the simplest tweak you have made to your morning routine that saved the most time ?",96,1757917243.0,productivity,4,0.96,False

And now I have this weird feeling of feeling nervous or anxiety. It wasn't bad like before but kinda consistent, at the very least for few minutes when I'm definitely noticing it.

I have already taken my daily bisoprolol but can't shake this feeling.

I got an oximeter for the bpm and I have been getting 100bpm after taking my daily bisoprolol.

Check the comments for the reading link.,"I dragged myself down the cobblestone path. My body ached. My feet hurt. But my heart was singing. 

**Read Link:** [**https://writers.juegofree.com/cobblestone-1/**](https://writers.juegofree.com/cobblestone-1/)

“Just a few more hours,” I whispered. “Until tonight.” 

Tonight was everything. No more going back to that house. No more pretending they were family. 

I’d already asked for time off work. My boss spat at me. Called me lazy. Typical. Omegas always got the worst treatment. 

But I didn’t care tonight. 

I was going to Gabriel’s. My boyfriend. Soon-to-be fiancé. 

Tomorrow was the Lunar Assembly. Sacred ceremony. Wolves finding their mates under the Moon Goddess. Tomorrow was also my 

eighteenth birthday. Finally old enough. 

Gabriel promised we’d bond tomorrow. I could escape forever. 

Gabriel. Rich. Gorgeous. An Alpha’s brother. Sure, I was just an omega. But Gabriel said bloodlines didn’t matter. Love mattered. 

I practically skipped toward his house. My heart hammered with excitement. Beautiful stone building in the center of town. So much 

better than our pathetic wooden shack. Soon I’d live here. With Gabriel. Forever. 

I knocked eagerly. 

Nothing. 

My smile faltered. That’s… odd. Gabriel said he’d be waiting. He promised. 

I tried the handle. Unlocked. Relief flooded through me. He must be inside. Maybe preparing a surprise? 

“Gabriel? It’s me!” I called out cheerfully. 

Silence. 

Wait. What was that? Sounds from upstairs. My heart lifted again. He was home after all. 

Then I heard it clearly. 

Laughter. 

Female laughter. 

Moaning. 

My world stopped spinning. No. No, that couldn’t be- 

1/5 

The sounds grew louder. Clearer. Destroying me with every breath. 

Gasps. Bed springs creaking. A voice that made my soul shatter. 

“Oh God, Gabriel… right there…” 

Valerie. My stepsister. 

My brain refused to process it. This wasn’t happening. This was a nightmare. I’d wake up any second. 

The bedroom door hung slightly open. Like a cruel invitation to witness my destruction. I saw them. 

Gabriel’s muscled back. Moving. Valerie’s pale body beneath him. Her golden hair fanned across his pillow like a victory flag. 

No no no no no. 

“You feel so much better than I imagined,” Gabriel panted. 

My heart exploded into a thousand pieces. Each word was a dagger. 

Valerie laughed. That cruel, sharp sound I knew so well. “Better than that pathetic omega sister of mine, I bet. Poor little Sera probably 

doesn’t even know what to do with a real man.” 

The air left my lungs. I couldn’t breathe. Couldn’t think. Could only feel the agony ripping through my chest. 

“Don’t.” Gabriel’s voice was rough. “Don’t mention her when we’re like this.” 

“Why not?” Valerie’s fingers traced his spine like she owned him. “After tomorrow, she’ll know exactly where she stands. An omega like 

her could never satisfy you.” 

Each word was a physical blow. I stumbled backward, gasping for air. My shoulder slammed into the wall. The sound echoed like a 

gunshot. 

“What was that?” Valerie hissed. 

My wolf surged forward. Rage I’d never felt before. My foot connected with the door. It crashed against the wall. 

“WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?” 

They jumped apart. Gabriel nearly fell off the bed scrambling for his pants. Valerie just sat up. Didn’t even cover herself. 

“Seraphina!” Gabriel went white. “I can explain-” 

“Explain?” My voice cracked. “Explain how you’re screwing my sister?” 

“It’s not what you 

think-” 

“IT’S EXACTLY WHAT I THINK!” Tears streamed down my face. “You lying, cheating bastard!” 

Valerie stretched. Finally reached for Gabriel’s shirt. “Oh, sister dear. You really thought he’d choose you?” She tilted her head. Mock 

sympathy. “How cute.”

“Valerie, don’t,” Gabriel warned. But his voice was weak. 

“Don’t what? Tell her the truth?” Valerie stood up slowly. “That Mom and Dad have known about us for months? That they practically threw me at Gabriel because they were embarrassed by their precious Alpha family being tied to an omega reject?” 

The world spun. “You’re lying.” 

“Am I?” Valerie moved to the mirror. Ran her fingers through her hair. “Why don’t you go home and ask them? I’m sure they’re waiting. 

Probably with our engagement announcement.” 

“Sera, listen-” Gabriel finally got his pants on. “This doesn’t have to change anything between us. We can still be friends-” 

“FRIENDS?” I lunged toward him. He caught my wrists. 

“You need to calm down,” he said. His grip was tight. Bruising. “Think about your position. Your family. You don’t want to make this 

worse.” 

I stared into his eyes. Eyes that had whispered promises just days ago. Now they were cold. Calculating. 

“Let go of me,” I whispered. 

“Sera-” 

“LET GO OF ME!” 

I wrenched free and ran. I burst through our front door. Victor and Elizabeth sat calmly in the living room. An elegant invitation lay on 

the coffee table between them. 

They showed no surprise at my tear-stained face. 

“You already knew?” My voice was barely a whisper. 

“Seraphina, sit down.” Victor’s voice was ice. “Yes, we know about Gabriel and Valerie. We fully support it.” 

Elizabeth picked up the invitation. Held it out. “This is their engagement announcement. Tomorrow at the Lunar Assembly, Gabriel will 

propose to Valerie. They hope you’ll attend as Valerie’s sister.” 

I stared at the beautiful invitation. Gabriel and Valerie’s names in gold. The silver Nightshadow crest. It was all real. 

“Why?” My voice cracked. “Why would you do this to me?” 

“Enough!” Victor shot to his feet. Backhanded me across the face. Hard. I crashed to the floor. My cheek burned. 

“You’re nothing but an abandoned child we took in out of pity. What right do you have to insult our daughter?” 

“You should be grateful we raised you.” Elizabeth’s voice was cold. “Now you know your place. Tomorrow you’ll bless your sister’s 

engagement. Then find yourself a suitable omega mate.” 

“I won’t!” I struggled to my feet. Tasted blood. “I’ll never bless this betrayal!” 

Victor raised his hand again. This time I was ready. I dodged and ran for the door.

“Get out of our house!” Elizabeth shrieked behind me. “Ungrateful little brat!” 

I fled into the night. Running blindly. Tears falling like broken pearls. 

I didn’t know where I was going; I only knew I couldn’t stop moving or the crushing pain would swallow me whole. I didn’t know how 

long I ran, but eventually I found myself on Main Street when a familiar voice made me stop. 

“Sera!” 

I spun around to see Ophelia running toward me, her dark hair flying behind her. 

“I saw you run in-what happened? You look like you’ve seen a ghost.” 

“Worse.” I collapsed into her arms. “I’ve seen the truth.” 

“Tell me.” 

So I did. Every horrible detail, every cruel word. Ophelia held me while I shook. 

“Those bastards,” she hissed when I finished. “All of them. Gabriel, Valerie, your so-called parents.” 

“What am I going to do?” I cried against her shoulder. “Tomorrow is the Lunar Assembly. Everyone will see Gabriel and Valerie’s 

engagement. I’ll be the laughingstock of the entire pack.” 

“Listen to me, Sera.” Ophelia stroked my hair gently. “We’re not waiting for that damned ceremony. Tonight, we’re going to Silver Moon 

Harbor!” 

“What?” I pulled back to look at her, still having tears on my face. 

“I heard there’s a huge party in Silver Moon Harbor tonight. Lots of wolves from other packs who are here for tomorrow’s ceremony will be there.” Ophelia’s eyes sparkled with excitement. “We’re going to have some fun and forget all about these bastards and your heartless 

family!” 

“But… but I…” I hesitated. As an omega, Silver Moon Harbor was completely foreign territory to me. 

“But what?” Ophelia gripped my hands. “Sera, you’ve lost everything here. Instead of staying to be humiliated tomorrow, let’s go to Silver 

Moon Harbor and try our luck. Maybe you’ll meet your real destined mate-someone who won’t give a damn about your bloodline.” 

I looked into Ophelia’s determined eyes, thinking about the cruel words I’d heard in Gabriel’s bedroom, remembering my parents’ cold 

faces, imagining the humiliation I’d face tomorrow… 

“Okay.” I wiped away my tears, feeling a fierce courage I’d never experienced before. “Let’s go to Silver Moon Harbor tonight. Let all those 

people go to hell!” 

Ophelia grinned with delight. “Now that’s my Seraphina! Come on, let’s go back to my place and get ready. Tonight, we’re going to show the most beautiful girl!” ",1,1757917150.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,1,1.0,False
