Just relocated to Maryland a few weeks ago and still finding my footing in a new state. Moving as an adult is no joke — you leave behind your whole social circle and kind of have to start from scratch. So here I am, putting myself out there!
A little about me: I'm 6'5"", 210 lbs, and I stay pretty active — I work out regularly and am in good shape. I take my health seriously and it's a big part of my lifestyle, so if you're into fitness or just enjoy an active partner-in-crime for outdoor stuff, we'd probably get along great.
I'm easygoing, laid back, and genuinely just looking for someone to hang out with — grab coffee, explore the area, check out local spots, maybe catch a game or a show. I'm still discovering what Maryland has to offer, so honestly having someone to explore with would be a bonus.
I'm not looking for anything complicated. Just good conversation and good company. If you're around the MD area and want to show a newcomer around — or just want someone new to talk to — shoot me a message. Tell me a little about yourself and we can go from there.

Everyone froze.

Captain Whiskers was sitting on the teacher’s desk… inside her coffee mug.

1r6b440,https://www.reddit.com/r/RelentlessMen/comments/1r6b440/how_to_make_them_chase_you_the_psychology_of/,How to Make Them Chase You: The Psychology of Scarcity That Actually Works,"okay so here's something nobody talks about. we're told to ""be yourself"" and ""don't play hard to get"" but then wonder why people lose interest the second we show genuine enthusiasm. meanwhile that one person who's barely available has everyone obsessed. what the hell?

spent way too long researching this because it was driving me insane. turns out the psychology is actually fascinating, and there's a way to create natural attraction without being manipulative or fake. i'm talking books, behavioral psychology research, relationship experts who actually know their shit. the stuff that explains why scarcity works and how to use it authentically.

here's the thing. scarcity isn't about playing games or pretending you don't care. it's about actually having a life worth living that naturally makes you less available. when you're genuinely invested in your own growth, hobbies, career, friendships, you become scarce by default. and that's magnetic as hell.

**the psychology behind it is simple.** we assign higher value to things that are rare or limited. it's called the scarcity principle and it applies to literally everything, relationships included. when someone is always available, always texting back instantly, always rearranging their schedule, our brain subconsciously registers them as low value. not because they are, but because abundance signals lower worth in our primal wiring. fucked up but true.

but here's where most people get it wrong. they start intentionally ignoring texts, canceling plans, acting disinterested. that's manipulation and it backfires spectacularly. real scarcity comes from genuinely prioritizing yourself. when you have standards, boundaries, and a full life, you're not ""playing"" hard to get. you ARE hard to get because your time actually matters.

**start by building a life you're obsessed with.** this sounds basic but most people skip this part entirely. they focus on attracting someone while having nothing going on themselves. get serious about a hobby that challenges you. dedicate real time to your career goals or side projects. maintain your friendships even when you're dating someone. pursue fitness goals that actually push you. when your week is genuinely packed with things you care about, you won't need to fake being busy.

the book **""Attached"" by Amir Levine and Rachel Heller** breaks down attachment styles in relationships and it's honestly a game changer for understanding this dynamic. Levine is a psychiatrist and neuroscientist at Columbia, and this book spent weeks on the NYT bestseller list for good reason. it explains why anxious attachment makes us overly available and how to develop secure attachment instead. the research is solid and it'll make you realize that healthy scarcity comes from security, not insecurity. this book will make you question everything you thought you knew about why you act desperate sometimes.

**maintain your standards without apology.** if someone's treating you mediocre, don't stick around hoping they'll change. when you tolerate breadcrumbing or inconsistent effort, you're signaling that your time has no value. the most attractive thing you can do is walk away from situations that don't meet your needs. not as punishment or strategy, but because you actually respect yourself too much to accept less.

here's what this looks like practically. someone texts you but they've been flaky lately? don't respond immediately just because you saw it. finish what you're doing first. someone suggests hanging out but gives zero effort in planning? ""i'm pretty busy this week but let me know if you want to grab coffee thursday at 6."" you're not playing games, you're just not bending over backwards for low effort.

**create mystery by having depth.** people chase what they don't fully understand yet. instead of oversharing everything about yourself immediately, reveal things gradually. not because you're hiding stuff but because you're an interesting person with layers. have opinions that aren't just echoing theirs. pursue interests they know nothing about. maintain parts of your life that are just yours.

if you want to go deeper on relationship psychology but don't have time to read stacks of books or aren't sure where to start, there's an app called BeFreed that's been really useful. it's a personalized learning app built by Columbia grads and former Google engineers that turns books, research papers, and expert insights on dating and relationship psychology into custom audio content. you can tell it your specific goal, like ""i want to understand attachment styles and stop being too available in relationships,"" and it pulls from sources like the books mentioned here plus relationship research and experts to create a tailored learning plan just for you. you can adjust the depth from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with real examples when something really clicks. it also has this virtual coach you can chat with about your specific struggles. makes it way easier to actually internalize this stuff during commutes instead of just reading about it once and forgetting.

**learn to be comfortable alone.** this is the real secret. when you genuinely enjoy your own company and don't NEED someone else to feel complete, that energy is intoxicating. people can sense desperation from a mile away. but they can also sense when someone is perfectly fine without them, and that's when they start chasing. spend intentional time solo. get comfortable eating alone, traveling alone, enjoying your own thoughts. it builds a foundation that makes you naturally less needy.

one thing that helped me was this **Mark Manson article about fuck yes or no**. basically if someone isn't enthusiastically into you, move on. and if you're not enthusiastically into them, let them go. the in between lukewarm shit is where people waste years. when you adopt this mentality, you stop chasing people who are meh about you, which immediately makes you scarcer and more attractive to everyone else.

**stop rewarding bad behavior.** when someone ghosts then reappears, most people are so relieved they welcome them back instantly. that teaches the person they can treat you however and you'll accept it. instead, when someone shows inconsistent interest, match their energy or do less. not out of spite, just out of self preservation. people chase what they think they might lose. if you're always there no matter how they act, there's nothing to chase.

the podcast **""Where Should We Begin"" by Esther Perel** has incredible insights on relationship dynamics and desire. Perel is literally one of the top relationship therapists in the world, her TED talks have millions of views. she explains how mystery and separateness actually fuel desire in relationships, while too much closeness kills it. listening to real couples navigate this stuff is wild and you'll pick up so much about maintaining healthy distance.

**communicate your needs clearly but don't negotiate them.** if you need consistent communication, say that. if you need effort in planning dates, say that. but don't argue about it or try to convince someone to meet your standards. just state it and see if they rise to it. if they don't, you have your answer. this creates scarcity because you're showing you'll walk away rather than accept less, which makes people who actually value you step up harder.

the real breakthrough happens when you stop seeing scarcity as a tactic and start seeing it as a natural byproduct of self respect. when your time genuinely matters to you, when you have goals that excite you, when you refuse to tolerate mediocre treatment, you become scarce automatically. and that's when people start chasing, because they recognize you're not someone who's going to wait around forever.

it's not about being cold or distant. you can still be warm, affectionate, enthusiastic when you're together. the difference is you're not always available, always accommodating, always the one putting in effort. you have a full life they get to be part of, not an empty life they get to fill.",1,1771252254.0,RelentlessMen,0,1.0,False

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

1r6b29d,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1r6b29d/is_experiential_marketing_a_good_investment_for/,Is experiential marketing a good investment for small businesses trying to stand out in a crowded market?,"I've been running my coffee shop for about five years now, and lately I've been thinking a lot about how to create more memorable interactions with customers beyond just the usual social media posts or email newsletters. You know, something that really sticks with people and turns one-time visitors into regulars. Experiential marketing seems like it could be the way to go, where you design events or installations that let customers engage with your brand in a hands-on way, like pop-up tasting sessions or interactive displays that tell your story.

What kinds of experiential setups have worked well for other small operations without breaking the bank?

From what I've read, companies in this space focus on strategy and production to build those emotional connections, and it can scale down even for smaller budgets if you start simple. For instance, a local boutique might host a workshop where customers customize products, which not only boosts immediate sales but also generates word-of-mouth buzz.

How do you measure the return on something like that, especially when you're watching every dollar?

Another angle is integrating tech into these experiences, like AR filters for in-store fun or virtual tours that extend the event online. This could help small businesses reach wider audiences without huge costs, turning a local event into something shareable across platforms. I've seen examples where a food truck used a themed scavenger hunt tied to their menu, and it doubled their foot traffic for weeks after.

With [Beyond Paint](https://beyondpaint.com/), you can turn those tired cabinets into a dazzling centerpiece with minimal effort and maximum results. Let’s dive into this easy DIY transformation and show you how to achieve a bright, refreshing look using the color [Bright White](https://beyondpaint.com/products/bright-white).



Prep Time: A Clean Slate  

The first step to any successful paint job is proper prep, and it’s easier than you think! Forget the tedious sanding and priming—[Beyond Paint](https://beyondpaint.com/) has you covered with its all-in-one formula that includes a primer, bonder, and sealer. All you need is a clean surface for the paint to adhere to.  

Here’s how to do it:  

\- Grab a degreaser like Simple Green, Zep Degreaser, or a simple vinegar and water mix.  

\- Wipe down all cabinet surfaces thoroughly, making sure to remove any grease or grime.  

Once you’re done cleaning, it’s time to get straight into the fun part—painting!    


The Star of the Show: Bright White  

We’re using [Bright White](https://beyondpaint.com/products/bright-white) for this project, a crisp, clean color that brightens any kitchen and makes the space feel new. Applying [Beyond Paint](https://beyondpaint.com/) is a breeze, thanks to its self-leveling properties.  



Here’s what you’ll need:  

\- A microfiber roller (3/8-inch nap is perfect!)  

\- An optional stippling brush for those tricky creases and corners.  

The microfiber roller works like magic, ensuring a smooth, even finish every time. Best of all, you can roll it in any direction, and the paint will self-level to perfection.  



Coat One and Done (Well, Almost)  

Start by applying your first coat of paint. There’s no need to stress about getting it perfect on the first try—[Beyond Paint](https://beyondpaint.com/) is designed for excellent coverage in just two coats.  

After the first coat is applied, let it dry for 2-4 hours. Grab a cup of coffee, catch up on your favorite show, or plan out your new cabinet hardware while you wait.  

Once the first coat is dry, apply your second coat of paint. That’s all it takes to achieve a professional, full-coverage finish!  

  


Optional: Add Extra Protection  

If your cabinets are in a high-traffic area or see a lot of daily wear and tear, consider adding a little extra protection. [Beyond Paint’s Multi-Purpose Sealer](https://beyondpaint.com/products/multi-purpose-sealer) is a great way to ensure long-lasting durability.  

Here’s how to apply it:  

1. Wait 3-5 days after your paint job to allow proper curing.  

2. Apply 2-3 thin coats of the sealer, allowing 2-4 hours of drying time between coats.  

3. If you’d like a third coat, wait a full week after the second coat to apply it.    


Finishing Touches  

What’s a fresh coat of paint without a little hardware upgrade? Swap out those old knobs and pull for something modern or stylish to complete the transformation.  

With [Beyond Paint](https://beyondpaint.com/), you’ve achieved a budget-friendly kitchen cabinet makeover that looks like it came straight out of a design magazine. No stripping, no sanding, no priming—just amazing results with minimal effort.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Then I landed in Melbourne.

First morning, I walked into a tiny laneway café. No flashy setup. Just locals grabbing their usual. I ordered a flat white.

Silky. Balanced. Zero bitterness.

First sip, and I genuinely paused. “Oh. So this is the baseline here.”

What surprised me was that it wasn’t a one-off. Over the next few days, I stopped planning and just walked. Around 7 km some days from my hotel. Phone data on, Google Maps open, trusting instinct.

A random Vietnamese shop served a bánh mì better than most I’ve had back home. Late-night pasta that tasted close to what I had in Rome. Bakeries casually putting out some of the best pastries I’ve had.

And none of it felt like it was trying too hard. No big marketing push. Just consistently good food.

I went to Oceania expecting scenery. I didn’t expect the food scene to quietly reset my standards.

1r6avsp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/1r6avsp/resentment_towards_partner/,Resentment towards partner,"I am currently 4 weeks postpartum and my partner has recently gone back to work full time. I am at home all day with a colicky baby doing my best through the breakdowns and not being able to even look after myself when he’s away. I have begun to resent him for how different we are handling things.

As I said before I am the one at home with the baby all day, I have cried ALOT, not been able to even enjoy a hot coffee before it goes cold, not eaten or drunk properly, not been able to shower or go to the toilet when I want. But through all that I will still care for my baby, talk softly to her, and comfort her when needed.

Now, my partner on the other hand will come home from an 8 hour shift, first thing is turn in his PC and load up a game, get changed into his comfies, and make himself a brew. I will ask him to hold the baby whilst I can at least go brush my teeth or go to the toilet, and all is well. As soon as she starts crying he will get annoyed and talk to her like she is the biggest inconvenience to exist. Half an hour in he will put her in the cot to let her “cry it out” and get annoyed at me for going to comfort her.

We have had a few arguments since her birth. The first being that he raised his voice at her when she was a week old and I told him to stop it. He came back at me with “don’t tell me what I can and can’t do” which was relatively shocking.

The second being she was refusing a bottle and he kept trying to push it onto her to the point of the was coughing and spluttering and yet again I told him to stop and at least give her a break. This ended in him almost chucking the bottle at me and passing the baby over and shouting at me. He told me to do it myself and how I always think I’m better than him and I’m parent of the year. I don’t think these things at all but force feeding a baby whilst she’s obviously struggling is just no common sense.

The third being when he was trying to play with her by chucking her up and catching her (she didn’t leave her hands that much tbf) but I thought this activity was a bit much for a baby that can’t lift her own head so I told him it made me nervous and to stop. Yet again apparently I’m better than him and I don’t trust him whatsoever.

And the fourth being last night when she woke up after a couple hours nap, he didn’t try comfort her or anything and tried putting her straight in her cot to cry it out. I told him you can’t just put her away when it pleases you and that yet again didn’t go down well.

I know he’s as frustrated as I am but the way he has reacted during for first few weeks makes me nervous for when she’s older and can actually comprehend everything. I guess my resentment comes from me being able to handle when she’s crying even though how hard it is and him getting angry all the time.

1r6astg,https://v.redd.it/w6h4ud328vjg1,What kinds of decisions get worse before you notice you’re sleep-deprived?,"Why “I’m fine, just a bit tired” is quietly steering your choices off-course.

Big picture framing

Before you realize you’re sleep-deprived, the first thing to slip isn’t your IQ—it’s your judgment. Sleep-deprived decisions tend to degrade in subtle domains: how you read people, weigh risks, and prioritize your time. You still feel more or less normal, which makes these shifts easy to miss and hard to correct. This post breaks down the early, invisible decision costs of lost sleep—plus what research suggests, why people differ, and how to build safeguards—so you can spot problems sooner and avoid “how did I think that was a good idea?” moments.

The invisible cost of being “just a little tired”

Most people imagine sleep loss shows up as obvious mistakes: nodding off in meetings, forgetting basic facts, making glaring errors.

In reality, the earliest damage is to decisions that rely on nuance, not raw brainpower:

reading tone and emotion

juggling trade-offs

resisting tempting short-cuts

choosing what not to do

Think of your brain like a camera. Being severely sleep-deprived is like having the lens cap on. Mild sleep loss is a greasy fingerprint on the lens: the picture still “looks fine” at a glance, but the details are distorted. You don’t notice the blur until you zoom in later—usually when you’re reviewing the outcome of your choices.

People also differ. Some feel devastated after one short night; others feel fine on 5–6 hours. But chronic mild sleep loss can erode performance as much as acute all-nighters. The tricky part: your self-assessment gets worse even as your confidence stays high, so you’re least reliable when you most think you’re okay.

Research Snapshot: Sleep and Decision Quality

Experiments where people slept 4–6 hours for multiple nights show reaction time and attention dropping to levels similar to pulling an all-nighter.

Studies find sleep loss increases emotional reactivity and negative interpretations of neutral faces and messages.

Risk-taking tends to shift: people get more impulsive with rewards and more avoidant of effortful, long-term planning.

You don’t need to memorize the papers. The takeaway: modest, repeated sleep loss quietly changes how you evaluate information, not just how fast you think.

Sleep-deprived decisions that quietly get worse

1. Social and emotional judgments

One of the first things to go is the way you interpret people.

When you’re sleep-deprived, you’re more likely to:

read neutral emails as negative or critical

snap at small interruptions

assume bad intent faster (“they’re ignoring me”)

overreact to minor setbacks

Because your emotional “gain” is turned up, your decisions about how to respond—to your partner, your teammate, your boss—get harsher and less generous. You might think you’re “just being honest,” but often you’re being tired and touchy. Over time, that means more conflict, less trust, and people sharing less information with you.

2. Risk, money, and reward trade-offs

Sleep-deprived decisions around risk often lean to unhelpful extremes.

You can become:

Too impulsive – saying yes to risky bets, extra scope, or aggressive timelines because your brain is chasing short-term reward.

Too avoidant – saying no to healthy, strategic risks because everything feels overwhelming, so “later” seems safer.

Either way, your calibration is off. You’re not seeing the true cost/benefit; you’re reacting to how tired you feel in the moment. This shows up in financial choices, project bets, and time commitments—where future-you inherits the fallout.

3. Micro-ethics and “small” integrity choices

Most of us won’t suddenly become villains when we’re sleep-deprived.

But tiny moral shortcuts get easier:

recycling old slides instead of updating the data

smoothing numbers to look “just a bit better”

avoiding hard conversations and letting small issues fester

These decisions feel trivial in the moment but accumulate into culture, reputation, and whether people trust your word. Sleep debt doesn’t make you a bad person; it just lowers the friction to doing the convenient thing instead of the right thing—especially when fatigue is chronic, not a one-off.

4. Prioritization and focus: choosing what to ignore

One of the most important decisions you make each day is, “What will I not do?”

Under sleep deprivation, your brain:

overvalues what’s urgent (notifications, pings, new requests)

undervalues what’s important but quiet (planning, deep work, reflection)

So your to-do list may still get shorter, but the order gets worse:

You answer emails instead of designing the strategy.

You fix tiny bugs instead of addressing the root cause.

You say yes to meetings instead of protecting focus time.

The result: you feel busy and depleted, yet strangely unsatisfied with your progress—and you may not connect that back to sleep.

A real-world example: the “I’m still sharp” manager

Imagine a manager, Alex, who’s been sleeping 5.5–6 hours a night for weeks.

Alex doesn’t feel dramatically tired. Coffee is working. No one sees obvious mistakes.

But watch Alex’s decisions:

Morning: Skips a 30-minute planning block to clear email, because everything feels urgent.

Midday: Reads a teammate’s short message as “passive-aggressive,” replies curtly, and doesn’t ask clarifying questions. That teammate shares less context next time.

Afternoon: In a budget discussion, waves through a vague but exciting initiative without probing assumptions—because mental effort feels disproportionately costly.

Evening: Says yes to another project (“we’ll figure it out”) instead of admitting the team is at capacity.

On paper, Alex worked hard. Nothing “broke.” But zoom out: priorities drifted, relationships cooled slightly, risks were taken on fuzzy assumptions, and future workload silently increased. That’s how chronic, mild sleep loss hurts you: through many small, unremarkable choices that slowly bend your trajectory.

How to spot slippage—and what to do when you must decide tired

Because your self-perception gets fuzzy when you’re tired, you need simple external checks—like a pilot’s instrument panel.

Try these:

Trend check: Are you more often thinking, “I’ll deal with that later” about important but uncomfortable choices?

Tone check: Have you re-read your own emails/texts and thought, “Oof, that sounds harsher than I meant”?

Risk check: Are you saying yes mostly to avoid short-term discomfort (disappointing someone, having a hard talk)?

Regret check: Over the last two weeks, do you have more “why did I agree to that?” moments than usual?

In real life, you can’t always wait to be rested—there are emergencies, launches, kids, crises. When you must decide while exhausted, build safeguards:

Use a short checklist (What’s the downside? Who’s affected? What are 2 alternatives?).

Get a second opinion from someone more rested or less involved.

For big, reversible choices, set an explicit review point when you’re better rested.

A simple rule of thumb: delay big decisions made while sleep-deprived when you can; when you can’t, wrap those decisions in structure and other people’s judgment.

Bringing it all together

The decisions that get worse before you notice you’re sleep-deprived are the subtle ones: how kind you are under pressure, how you judge risk, what you quietly tolerate, and what you choose to ignore. These don’t announce themselves as “tired mistakes”; they show up later as strained relationships, misaligned priorities, and commitments you wish you hadn’t made—especially when short nights become your default.

If you want more reliable judgment, treat sleep as part of your decision-making system, not just a wellness habit. Protect it when you can, and when you can’t, assume your thinking is tilted and lean on safeguards.

And if questions like this help you think better, consider following QuestionClass’s Question-a-Day at questionclass.com—it’s a simple way to keep sharpening the quality of the questions behind your decisions.

🧬QuestionStrings to Practice

“QuestionStrings are deliberately ordered sequences of questions where each answer fuels the next, creating a ladder of insight. What to do now: use this to audit important decisions you’re making on low sleep, and decide whether to slow down, seek input, or wait until you’re rested.”

Fatigue-Filter String

For when you’re not sure if it’s really a good idea—or just that you’re tired:

“What’s the actual decision I’m making right now?” →

“How big are the consequences if this goes wrong?” →

“On a 1–10 scale, how rested do I feel today?” →

“If I were fully rested, would I still make the same call?” →

“Is this important enough to sleep on or run past someone I trust?”

Try weaving this into your one-on-ones, planning sessions, or evening journaling. You’ll start to see patterns in where sleep debt quietly hijacks your judgment.

In the end, noticing which decisions slip first when you’re sleep-deprived is less about perfection and more about awareness—you can’t fully control your sleep every night, but you can learn when to distrust your own “I’m fine” and give your future self better odds.",1,1771251490.0,QuestionClass,0,1.0,False

in high school and university i had a couple of close female friends, but nothing romantic. we were just very close. i wasn’t really attracted to most of them, and most of them had boyfriends anyway.

over the last few months i’ve started wanting a girlfriend, but i’m careful because i’m afraid of rejection. i usually only make a move when i feel like the girl is also interested. the problem is that every time i’ve tried, it hasn’t worked out, and i’m left confused.

the first girl approached me first and tried to get my attention, so i thought it would be easy. we had a good conversation and continued texting. however, over text she gave short or low-effort replies and seemed distant. in person, though, she was always lively and excited to see me, and she would come up to me first to start a conversation. since we live in different cities, texting was our main way of communicating, but she never reached out first and her replies threw me off, so i eventually stopped trying.

the second situation happened a couple of weeks ago. she also tried to get my attention at first, but because of my previous experience, i held back. eventually we had a few interactions where she seemed genuinely interested in getting to know me, so i asked her out for coffee. she didn’t explicitly say no, but she also didn’t say yes. her response was vague, even when i asked when she’d be free.

what confuses me is that both of them showed interest, approached me first, we had great conversations, and they still approach me when they see me. but when it comes to texting consistently or actually meeting up, nothing happens.

am i doing something wrong? i don’t have any dating experience, so i’m not sure if i’m misreading signals or missing something obvious.",1,1771251485.0,datingadvice,1,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Need some encouragement.,"Hi all, have been feeling out of my wits and frustrated with my current situation. It has been impossible for me to lose ANY weight even though I’ve cut out sugar/snacking and have been eating cleanly since January. And, I haven’t gotten my period since December 2025. Even then, it was just spotting/very light and not a full bleed. So, the last time I had a proper bleed was October 2025..

In the last two years, I’ve managed to regulate my cycles to be somewhat consistent. My cycles would range between 40-50 days. I know, not completely ideal but at least I was able to track the different phases of my cycles and knew when my period was going to come. I don’t know what happened in November but that’s when the cycles started stretching to 60 days and now 69 days with no period in sight. 

My routine hasn’t changed much but I decided to start the new year with a cleaner and more active lifestyle.

Here’s what I’ve been doing since the start of the year: 

\- Taking my supplements: Ovasitol, Berberine, Omega-3 Fish Oil and Spearmint Tea twice a day. I recently switched to Ovasitol 3 weeks ago. 

\- Exercising more regularly: Pilates and Strength training at least 3-4 times a week, going on long walks (10km) at least once a week and trying to clock at least 7K steps a day

\- eating more cleanly: prioritizing protein and whole foods, reducing snacking and sugar, reducing dairy and cutting out coffee in the AMs or not even drinking coffee at all 

My weight hasn’t budged at all since I started this new routine, though I do feel more toned. My period is nowhere in sight, but it does feel like I’ve just been stuck in a luteal phase for weeks on end. So incredibly bloated everyday that I can barely fit my pants. Also really tired and fatigued.

After switching to Ovasitol, i thought that I might start ovulating and realized my discharge was similar to that of when I was in my luteal phase (gushes). But, I’m afraid to conclude that I’m in my luteal phase because I feel like my body might just be lying to me.

I’m not sure what triggered this PCOS flare up as I’ve been relatively stress free in my job/personal life. But, not getting my period and constantly anticipating it, plus dealing with all these “pre-period symptoms” have made me extremely stressed and anxious. Any tips or words of encouragement would be greatly appreciated :(",0,1771251398.0,PCOS,2,0.33,False

[(Part 1 Continuation)](https://www.reddit.com/r/humansarespaceorcs/comments/1r66yf9/when_the_sigelsol_lost_its_shine/) \- (Part 3)

The day after that first tow, the world didn’t feel different in any single, dramatic way; the light was still pale, the sky still looked clean to anyone who wasn’t trained to read trouble in fractions; but the tone underneath everything shifted, like a building settling after a deep crack.

Because once there’s metal in motion, you can’t keep pretending you’re still only talking.

On the street, people still went to work; they still bought coffee; they still argued about sports and streamed old dramas and complained about rent; and if you didn’t look up for more than a heartbeat, you could almost forget the sky had changed. But if you did look up—really look—you saw it; midday glare that didn’t sting; a brightness that felt filtered; shadows that softened at the edges like somebody had rubbed them with a thumb. It was the kind of wrong that your body noticed before your mind accepted it.

The clearing work kept going; it never stopped; the sifters still ran inward, beam arrays still pushed, shepherd fields still tried to nudge Steorr-drōs into thinner bands; and for a while the public feeds stayed full of cautious optimism—corridors carved, Sigelshine ticked up along narrow lanes, a few clime charts twitched kinder—just enough progress for people to argue that we were fine, just enough to keep the comfortable from demanding uncomfortable action.

But inside the brief rooms, the language had already changed.

Nobody said “fix” anymore; they said “rate,” they said “throughput,” they said “time to threshold,” they said “re-accumulation”; and every report, no matter how it was dressed, carried the same truth in the margins; we can move it, but not fast enough to bet Eorð-ēðel on it.

That’s what made the cooling feel so dangerous; not because it was already killing us, but because it wasn’t; the cold was still slight, still in the range where forests didn’t die in a season and oceans didn’t lock; it was just enough to stress the grid, just enough to shave yields, just enough to widen frost windows and push “temporary adjustments” into weekly habit; and slight is seductive; slight makes people wait; slight convinces you that tomorrow will look like today, right up until the day it doesn’t.

I remember the first morning my breath fogged in what the calendar insisted was late summer; I stood outside a transit gate with my hands in my pockets, watching my own exhale hang in the air; a teenager beside me was wearing a thin shirt like it was a dare; an older woman had a thermal wrap pulled tight and looked angry at the day itself. Nobody said anything, but we all felt the same thought pass through the crowd: this is early.

The farms felt it first, like always. You can pretend light is “a little off” until a crop misses its window. Greenhouses ran lamps at noon. Field belts revised targets downward in quiet spreadsheets, then tried to hide those revisions behind words like “variance” and “localized anomaly.” Pollinators drifted slower. Leaves stayed smaller. You could walk a row and feel the plants holding back, conserving, as if the whole living layer of the world had decided it didn’t trust the sky.

So the planners did what planners do when belief starts getting in the way of survival; they put teeth in the math.

They stopped leading with images and started leading with slopes; they laid the numbers out in plain chains; less Sigelshine means lower average heat input; lower heat input means longer heating season; longer heating season means higher demand peaks; higher peaks mean rolling reductions; rolling reductions mean stressed agriculture; stressed agriculture means lower reserves; lower reserves means you lose the luxury of a bad year; and the whole time the trend line keeps sliding while people argue about what word to call it.

Once you see the chain written cleanly, you understand why everyone in the serious rooms looked tired; not panicked, tired; because tired is what you get when you’ve been doing the same mental arithmetic all day and it always comes out the same.

Outside the serious rooms, people kept trying to invent stories, because stories feel like control. Some blamed the air again, even after it was ruled out; a new flavor of rumor claimed it was deliberate, some Heofon consortium throttling light to force orbital taxes; another rumor said the clearing crews had “made it worse” by stirring the dust into denser bands; you could watch an entire network spin up around a misunderstanding of a graph, because graphs don’t soothe anyone who didn’t learn to read them. There were even soft-spoken feeds that called it a “natural correction,” the star resetting itself, as if Sigel had opinions about our politics.

None of those stories mattered to the numbers. The numbers just kept sliding.

That’s when the Lēohtscield stopped being a speculative slide deck and became the only plan that had a controllable timeline; not a replacement for Sigel, not a second sun, not some sealed dome fantasy; a buffer; a stabilizer; a way to flatten variance while the clearing work kept grinding in Heofon.

And the first hard truth of it landed fast: you don’t build a planet-scale buffer with good intentions; you build it with bulk.

People love to talk about “technology” like it’s a spell; as if saying the word makes the hard parts disappear; but the hard parts were simple and brutal; mass, energy, and time; the yards could fabricate ribs and frames, yes, but not out of air; you can print a curve, but you still need feedstock; and once the build schedule was compressed into an emergency timeline, “normal mining” wasn’t a strategy, it was a wish.

So the procurement lists got honest.

At first, they went after what you’d expect; belt ore, dead projects, old hull stock, anything already in circulation that could be melted down without starting a political fire; it felt almost comforting, like we could recycle our way out; and for a few weeks, that illusion held; printers ran, tow schedules filled, and people who wanted to believe in a clean fix pointed at the growing rib inventory and said, see, we’re doing it.

Then the updated mass budget dropped, and the illusion died.

Because ribs are only the skeleton; you still need the layers that make the skeleton useful; routing films, thermal banks, control surfaces, service corridors, docking structures, redundancy; and every layer adds weight; every bit of redundancy—every “just in case”—adds weight; and when you’re wrapping infrastructure around a planet, “a bit” becomes obscene.

That’s when Mercury and Pluto moved from whispered possibilities to typed line items; not as dramatic declarations, just as entries in a schedule with dates beside them; Mercury for dense feedstock and proximity; Pluto for deep reserves and volatiles and long-haul stability; and the moment those names were in the official flow, you could feel the whole system flinch, like a body realizing it’s about to do something it can’t undo.

The public version called it “reclamation.” The internal version called it “throughput.” Most ordinary people called it what it felt like: taking apart pieces of the system to keep the home from slipping.

People argued about it, of course; the arguments were loud enough to drown out the quieter truth for a while.

Some said the homeworld didn’t have the right to drain Heofon; that if you strip every yard and tug to save one planet, you risk making the rest of humankind brittle; and they weren’t wrong; there are a hundred ways to win one battle and lose the war you didn’t admit you were in.

Some said the opposite; that Eorð-ēðel wasn’t “one planet,” it was the anchor; the thing that holds culture and biology and identity in place; that letting it slide into instability would create migrations and collapses that would ripple through every habitat and station anyway; and they weren’t wrong either.

Some people hated the very concept of managed daylight; they said it out loud in the streets—“you’re going to route the day like a utility,” “you’re going to sell warmth,” “you’re building a lever over everyone’s life”; and even when the claims were exaggerated, the fear underneath them made sense; because once you admit the sky can be engineered, you’ve admitted it can be engineered badly.

That fear came with slogans; Day is not a commodity; Warmth belongs to all; Keep the sky open. Protestors gathered under pale afternoons and held up their signs like shields. Some were sincere and scared; some were just angry because anger feels better than helplessness; and a few were opportunists, selling “anti-shield” merch with glossy prints of Sigel that looked brighter than the real one ever did anymore.

And in the middle of that noise, the work kept moving, because the numbers didn’t pause for public therapy.

In Heofon, shipyards did what they always do in a real emergency; they stopped making optional things and started making necessary ones; exploration hulls got shelved half-finished; prestige expansions were paused; old contracts were bought out or quietly canceled; printer lines that used to be scheduled months out were re-queued overnight; and the new output was blunt, repetitive, unglamorous: curved rib segments, joint nodes, truss runs, service corridor shells.

The ribs had a working name on the inside—Scieldhring—not for poetry, just to keep everyone speaking the same language; and those first rings were the point where the project became visible in the sky; not as a full shell, just as arcs and curves that caught dawn light and drew a thin pale line above the horizon like a scar that hadn’t healed yet.

The first time a rib cast a faint moving shadow across a coastal city at sunrise, it wasn’t even darkness; it was a soft dimming that slid over rooftops like a cloud; people stopped mid-step; some filmed it; some cursed; some just stared, because the sky had always been something you lived under, not something you watched being built in real time.

That was also the first time the feeds split into camps that didn’t talk to each other; one camp posted the clip like a promise—look, it’s real, it’s working, we’re doing something; the other camp posted the same clip like a warning—look, they’re putting bars over the day. Same pixels, two different worlds.

And then came the first real variance event.

It wasn’t a storm. It wasn’t a sudden blackout. It was a drift in Steorr-drōs that thickened a band between Sigel and us for just long enough to matter. The input dipped hard for forty-eight hours. Two days. That’s all. In another era, two days of cloudy weather wouldn’t have been worth a headline.

But it wasn’t weather. It was upstream.

The clime systems couldn’t compensate fast enough. Heating demand surged because the night cold sharpened. Reservoir evaporation slowed, which sounds like a benefit until you remember it also means less energy in the cycle. A few crop belts took cold stress right at a sensitive phase, and the yield models revised again, quietly, like a person lowering their voice in a bad room.

That’s when the grid issued the first “priority stability notice” with language that didn’t pretend it was friendly.

Nonessential load reductions. Mandatory schedule shifts. Emergency indoor minimums. Hospitals exempt; everyone else negotiable.

I was in a clinic corridor when the lights dimmed; not off, just reduced, the way a place breathes when it’s conserving; a nurse didn’t even look up, just kept moving, because professionals adapt faster than the rest of us; but in the waiting area, a child started crying like they’d felt the cold in the air before it arrived.

And in the control rooms, that variance event did something more important than the discomfort; it proved the new reality; a small upstream shift could ripple into social strain inside of days.

That’s when the governance problem stopped being theoretical.

Because if the Lēohtscield was going to do anything meaningful before it was finished—and it had to, or the whole timeline was pointless—then it would do it unevenly at first; partial coverage, partial routing, partial buffering; and the moment you can help one region more than another, you are choosing winners and losers in slow motion.

The first drafts tried to hide that behind automation; model-driven allocation, objective routing, equitable distribution; phrases that look clean on paper; and then someone asked the simplest question in the room, the kind that makes everyone look down at their hands.

“Equitable compared to what?”

Because “equitable” doesn’t mean nobody suffers; it means you decide how suffering is shared; it means you decide whether food belts get priority over urban comfort, whether water systems get stabilized before coastal grids, whether a million people shiver so a harvest doesn’t fail; and those aren’t engineering decisions, even if you wrap them in math.

So the committees did what they could; they built tier systems; food and water first, then grid stability, then comfort; they created emergency overrides for sudden cold snaps; they wrote rules for variance events, meaning periods where the input from Sigel dipped hard because Steorr-drōs shifted into a denser band; they created a language for choosing that didn’t sound like choosing.

Meanwhile the public lived the early symptoms of a managed world before they ever benefited from it; the grid issued more heat holidays, rolling reductions during peak demand; the notices were packed with polite words—temporary, rotating, load sharing—but the meaning was felt in apartments and classrooms and hospital corridors; sometimes your district went colder on purpose so the system didn’t crack.

And the moment that started, you could feel the cultural hinge; people stopped treating the dimming like a curiosity and started treating it like a debt; the produce aisle got smaller; the price tags got sharper; school start times shifted; factory shifts moved away from the coldest dawn hours; and the phrase “temporary adjustment” started sounding like a joke nobody laughed at.

The food system did what it could; rationing came in sideways at first, not as a single decree, but as substitutions; fewer fresh greens, more shelf-stable; more paste, more powder; and the public reacted like the public always reacts when the pantry starts changing; not with immediate collapse, but with a simmering suspicion that someone else is getting better than you are.

That suspicion found targets.

People blamed Heofon. People blamed the consortiums. People blamed the “science class.” People blamed farmers for “hoarding” light. Farmers blamed city councils for wasting power on signage. City councils blamed private climate domes for siphoning heat. Everyone blamed someone, because blame is easier than accepting that the sky doesn’t care about fairness.

In the same weeks, the clearing crews kept shaving at Steorr-drōs, and their reports got more competent and less comforting.

They stopped promising “we’re clearing it” and started saying “we can hold this corridor for twelve days,” “we can predict drift for five,” “we can reduce obscuration in this band by this fraction”; grown-up progress; the kind that doesn’t headline well but keeps you alive; and every time a corridor clouded back in, the Lēohtscield schedule gained another layer of urgency, because the shield was the only thing we could accelerate with our own hands.

I talked to someone who had rotated back from an inner-lane run near Sigel—skin still raw under clinic light, eyes still squinting like the glare had burned itself into them.

“You think it’s a cloud,” they said; “like one thing you can sweep aside; it’s not; it’s a whole field; you thin it, it slides; you burn a patch, it helps, then drift drags more across the same line; it’s not mocking you; it’s just persistent.”

That word again; persistent; like a diagnosis you can’t argue with.

And that persistence was what forced the second half of the plan to accelerate; feeding the build.

Because building ribs is one kind of hard; feeding ribs is another; you can’t make mass appear; you have to move it; and moving it at that scale turns the system into a logistics engine whether anyone likes it or not.

That’s when everyone started watching the same pass windows; the Feaxede Steorran calendar; comets on long tracks, rich in metals and volatiles; in another year, they would’ve been profit opportunities; in this year, they were lifelines; because a clean capture and a clean crack could buy weeks of print time, weeks of assembly, weeks of earlier buffering; and weeks mattered now the way hours matter when you’re watching someone bleed.

Contracts went live across Heofon; harvest fleets that used to chase margins started chasing deadlines; refinery barges were refit for higher throughput; tug lines were reassigned; and suddenly you had dispatchers talking like farmers—“if we land this pass clean,” they’d say, “we hold the belts through winter.”

At the same time, Mercury ramps began in earnest; industrial nodes expanded; cutters went down; foundries ran hotter; output streams began flowing inward toward assembly lanes like blood toward a wound; it wasn’t glorious, it was necessary.

I heard a Mercury worker on a leaked audio, laughing in that dry way people laugh when they’re trying not to be scared.

“They keep saying ‘reclamation,’” they said; “I keep saying ‘heat’; the rock doesn’t care what word you pick; it only cares how fast you try to cut it.”

Pluto convoys started assembling far out—slow, disciplined, long-haul mass trains—because anything that far forces you into commitment; you can’t improvise a Pluto schedule halfway through; you plan it, you launch it, and you accept that the payoff comes later.

That’s how the shield became real; not as a single moment, but as a thousand synchronized pivots; yards re-queued, fleets reassigned, rules drafted, protests screamed, heat holidays scheduled, harvest windows circled; the whole system leaning into the same direction because the alternative was to let the slope pick victims for us.

And through all of it, the cooling stayed slight; just enough to scare the people who read thresholds for a living, not enough to scar the world permanently yet; that “yet” became the quiet drumbeat behind every decision; get ahead of it, because if you wait for damage to be obvious, you’ve already waited too long.

The last internal update I saw before the comet rush truly kicked into high gear was short; boring, even; which is how you know it mattered.

Scieldhring Segment One: orbital staging achieved; assembly begins.

Routing film prototypes: first sustained test window scheduled.

Thermal bank cluster: mass allocation approved.

No speeches; just lines; and the meaning was simple; the Lēohtscield wasn’t an idea anymore; it was infrastructure in progress; and from that point on, the homeworld wasn’t just waiting under a dimming light—it was actively building a new way to survive under it.

The first sustained routing test didn’t happen on a day that felt dramatic; it happened on an ordinary gray afternoon, right after another small upstream dip, when the clime boards were staring at the forecasts and thinking, not about headlines, but about how many nights like this the grid could tolerate. The prototype routing films were still thin, still half experimental, still something you could tear if you tried to run them too hard; the thermal bank cluster was a partial, not a full buffer; and that was the point—this wasn’t the grand shield yet, this was the first time we tried to act like we already had one.

They warned us the way you warn people about maintenance, because nobody in charge wanted to admit it was an experiment. Expect minor brightness variance at dusk. Expect brief localized warming. Do not adjust personal climate systems beyond recommended limits. A polite notice for a thing that should have made every historian on the planet sit down.

At sunset, the sky didn’t suddenly blaze; it didn’t turn into a new day. It just… steadied. The last light lingered a little longer, as if someone had held the door open. The color shifted toward warmer tones that we hadn’t seen in weeks, and for a moment the city looked like it remembered what a normal evening was supposed to feel like. Then the night came anyway, but the edge of it wasn’t as sharp; the temperature drop was blunted; heaters cycled less hard; you could hear it, actually, in the quiet—fewer compressors kicking on, fewer emergency fans spinning up, less strain in the hum of the grid.

It was small. It was enough.

And because it was enough, it instantly became political.

One district posted footage of their warmer dusk and called it proof the shield was saving the world. Another district posted their own footage—no change, still gray—and called it proof the system was lying. People argued about whether the test had “favored” certain regions, as if a pilot run was the same thing as a promise. The food boards tried to explain that the first routing had to be near the belt nodes because that’s where the sensors were densest and the feedback loops fastest, but explanation rarely beats the feeling of being left out.

That night, I heard a couple in the stairwell of my building fighting in whispers; not about love, not about money, about warmth. “They routed it over the farms,” one of them said, voice tight; “they always route it over the farms.” The other answered, “If the farms fail, we all fail,” and even in the dark you could feel how thin patience had become.

Inside the committees, the routing logs were treated like sacred text. The engineers wanted to call it success; the clime-wrights wanted to call it “promising”; the grid wardens wanted to call it “insufficient”; and the governance people, the ones who had to translate it into rules, stared at the same graphs and saw only one thing: now we have leverage, and leverage attracts teeth.

They began rewriting the sky’s traffic, too, because once you have ribs in orbit, once you have films that have to be protected, you don’t get to treat low orbit like open road. Launch corridors were formalized. Service lanes were mapped. Every habitat and station in Heofon had to agree on keep-out bands around Scieldhring segments, not out of politeness, but because a collision at those speeds would turn the build into shrapnel that would haunt the homeworld for decades. The shield didn’t just demand mass; it demanded coordination; the kind of coordination that makes independent operators grind their teeth and sign anyway, because the alternative is chaos.

I visited a yard once during that period—nothing special, a tour for essential workers, a kind of morale theater—but the sound of it stayed with me; not sound in the old sense, because vacuum doesn’t carry, but the felt vibration through boots and railings, the constant tremor of fabrication, the repeated bright flash of weld-light on the far side of a viewport. A crew member beside me pointed at a joint node the size of a house and said, almost lovingly, “That bolt will hold your winter.” They weren’t being poetic; they were being literal.

When I asked how they slept, they laughed.

“You don’t,” they said; “you nap between inspections; you dream in torque specs; you wake up thinking about microfractures; and then you remember the day is dimming and you get back to it.”

That was the mood everywhere; not heroism, not doom; work, pressure, the sense of a whole species tightening its grip on the world and refusing to let go.

And still, even with the first routing test, the first blunted night, nobody pretended the shield was the end of the story; the clearing crews were still the long lever, because Steorr-drōs had to be reduced or the managed world would become permanent by default. Every routing success made the public feel safer, and that safety was dangerous in its own way; it tempted people to relax; it tempted leaders to slow funding once the immediate discomfort eased. The planners fought that temptation with ugly honesty: the Lēohtscield buys time, it doesn’t cancel the slope; the slope only flattens when Sigelshine returns.

So the build and the clearing kept running in parallel; ring segments assembled; routing films expanded; thermal banks thickened; sifters cut corridors; beams pushed; and the Feaxede Steorran calendar kept crawling closer, because without fresh mass, the whole dream stalled.

Because once the shield skeleton is in place, the only question that matters is how fast you can feed it, how clean you can harvest, how many weeks you can buy before the variance turns from “slight cooling” into “permanent damage”; and in 2984, the one thing you can’t mine from any rock is the one thing everyone suddenly needed.

Time.

They said hosting public DOJ documents is ""not supported."" Here's what happened and what's new.","Dev here. Some of you may remember my posts from last week about EpsteinExposed.com. Those posts hit about 4.6 million views combined and brought in thousands of new users. Since then I've been heads down building new features and processing data around the clock.

Then I got this email from Buy Me a Coffee.

**What happened**

BMC reached out asking me to explain what my site does and why people are donating. Fine, reasonable question. I wrote them a detailed response explaining that the site is a free, open source, searchable database of documents released by the Department of Justice. I linked the Reddit post. I explained that supporters are covering server costs because the site has no ads and no paywalls.

Buy Me a Coffee's Response: ""Just heard back from the team and was advised that your proof was denied. So sorry for the inconvenience! Your donations will be refunded back to your supporters within 30 business days but please let us know if you want to have the refund done earlier so your supporters can donate through other platforms!""

Let me be clear about what this site hosts. Every single document comes from official public releases. DOJ disclosures, FBI vault releases, House Oversight documents, FAA flight records, federal court filings. This is all public record. The government released these files. I made them searchable. That apparently crosses a line for BMC's ""community standards.""

I'm not going to pretend this doesn't sting. That money was keeping the servers running. I've been paying out of pocket since then.

**We moved to GiveSendGo**

If you previously donated through BMC, check your bank statements over the next 30 days for the refund. I'm sorry for the hassle.

New donation page: [https://www.givesendgo.com/EpsteinExposed](https://www.givesendgo.com/EpsteinExposed)

The site also accepts alternative methods. I'm diversifying platforms so no single company can pull the plug again.

**What's been built since last post**

I haven't stopped working on the actual site. Here's what's new in the last week:

The database now has 1.1m documents in the search index (figure is down some because I am updating to improve the process), 1,589 persons cross-referenced, 1,708 flights mapped, nearly 10,000 emails cataloged, and 25,700 person co-occurrence pairs showing who appears in the same documents together. On top of that we have 638,000 redaction scores, 107,000 extracted entities, and 39,000 pages of recovered text from under government black bars.

New stuff:

* **AI research assistant** got a major overhaul. You can ask questions in plain English and it actually searches all of the documents, finds relevant evidence, and gives you an answer with citations. Investigation mode does deeper multi-step analysis. It was broken for a few days (kept running out of steps before reporting findings), that's fixed now.
* **PDF viewer with text search.** You can open any document and Ctrl+F search within the PDF itself. Highlights matches and jumps between pages. Sounds basic but when you're looking through 500 page depositions it makes a huge difference.
* **Deep search across document content.** The search page now pulls results from inside document text, not just titles. So if someone's name appears on page 47 of a deposition, you'll find it.
* **Person co-occurrence analysis.** Every person page now shows who they appear in documents with most often, ranked by shared document count. Maxwell and Epstein share 857 documents. You can explore these overlap patterns to find connections the media hasn't reported on.
* **Mention context.** When you look at a person's profile, you can see the exact sentence where they're mentioned in each document. Not just ""this person is linked to this document"" but the actual text surrounding the mention. 31,700 context snippets across the database.
* **Blog with analysis.** Started publishing writeups breaking down specific threads in the case files. The plea deal, the academia pipeline, the European connections, Maxwell's clemency play.
* **PDF fallback system.** A lot of PDFs on justice.gov were returning 404 errors. Built a proxy that tries the original source, then tries corrected URL patterns, then falls back to Archive.org's Wayback Machine cache. Thousands of documents that were broken are now readable again.

**What's coming**

Email threading so you can follow conversation chains instead of reading emails in a flat list. Persistent rate limiting. More OCR coverage (109,000 documents still need text extraction). Automated DOJ release monitoring so new documents get indexed within hours of being published.

And yeah I'm thinking about building a browser extension. Imagine reading a news article about someone and their name lights up because they appear in 47 Epstein documents. Right-click any name on any webpage and instantly cross-reference it against the database. That's the direction this is going.

**The bigger picture**

A payment processor looked at a database of public court records and decided it was too dangerous to fund. Think about what that means. These are documents the government itself released. If a company won't even let people donate to keep them searchable, what does that tell you about the pressure to make this stuff disappear?

The depositions are happening. Wexner already testified. More are coming. Congress is fighting DOJ over redactions. Six names were read into the congressional record from under government black bars last week. This is not slowing down.

Everything is at [https://EpsteinExposed.com](https://epsteinexposed.com/). Free. No ads. No paywall. Never.

If you want to help keep it running: [https://www.givesendgo.com/EpsteinExposed](https://www.givesendgo.com/EpsteinExposed)

Full cost transparency is on the page showing exactly where every dollar goes.

If you previously donated through BMC and want to re-donate, I genuinely appreciate it. If you can't donate, sharing the site helps just as much. Every time someone finds a connection we missed or flags bad data, the database gets better. Thank you so much for all of the millions who supported me here. I won't forget it ever

One person built this. But it takes a community to keep it honest.

1r6aib7,https://www.reddit.com/r/PrivacyCompass/comments/1r6aib7/how_to_change_your_netflix_country/,How to Change Your Netflix Country,"I was halfway through *Lupin* season 3 when I flew home from Paris. Opened my laptop in my apartment, fired up Netflix, and — gone. The whole next batch of episodes I'd been binging just… wasn't there anymore. Same account. Same subscription fee. Completely different catalog.

That was the moment it clicked for me: you're not really paying for Netflix. You're paying for *your country's version* of Netflix. And those two things are wildly different.

So here's the deal. Changing your Netflix country is possible, it works, and it takes about four minutes of setup. But Netflix has gotten absurdly good at detecting workarounds, especially heading into 2026. And there are a few gotchas that most guides conveniently skip over.

Let me walk you through what actually works right now.

# Why Netflix Shows Different Stuff in Different Countries

Before we get into the how, it's worth understanding *why* this problem exists at all — because it explains why Netflix fights so hard against VPNs.

Netflix doesn't own most of what it streams. It licenses content from studios and distributors, and those deals are carved up by geography. A studio might sell US rights to Netflix but UK rights to Sky, or Japanese rights to a local broadcaster. So Netflix is contractually *obligated* to block you from watching certain titles outside specific borders.

And the numbers are staggering. By the end of 2025, the US library had swelled to over 7,800 titles, with about 60% of that being Netflix Originals. But hop over to a smaller market and you might see thousands fewer options. As of early 2025, Iceland actually topped the charts with over 9,700 titles — bigger than the US — while countries like Pakistan or Nigeria sit at the opposite extreme.

Here's a rough snapshot of how libraries stack up:

|Country|Approx. Titles (Early 2025)|Notable Exclusives|
|:-|:-|:-|
|🇮🇸 Iceland|\~9,700+|Largest global library|
|🇺🇸 United States|\~7,800+|Biggest for Originals & Hollywood|
|🇬🇧 United Kingdom|\~7,000+|Strong BBC/UK-licensed content|
|🇨🇦 Canada|\~6,800+|Mix of US + international titles|
|🇦🇺 Australia|\~6,500+|Growing rapidly|
|🇯🇵 Japan|\~6,000+|Massive anime selection|
|🇩🇪 Germany|\~5,500+|European co-productions|

*Figures based on late 2025 tracking data from What's on Netflix and Comparitech.*

The point is: these libraries overlap *a lot*, but they're not identical. That show everyone on TikTok won't shut up about? Might be in six countries and missing from yours. Which is maddening when you're paying the same (or more) than people who get to watch it.

# The Actual Method: VPN + Netflix in Four Steps

A VPN (Virtual Private Network) reroutes your internet connection through a server in another country. Netflix checks your IP address to determine your location, so when you connect through, say, a Tokyo server — Netflix thinks you're sitting in Japan and serves you the Japanese catalog.

Here's the process, stripped down to what matters:

**1. Pick a VPN that actually works with Netflix.** This is the critical part. Out of 68 VPN providers tested, only a handful consistently unblock Netflix — the rest get flagged and blocked almost instantly. More on which ones below.

**2. Install the app on whatever device you're streaming from.** Phone, laptop, Fire Stick, smart TV — every major VPN has apps for all of them. Takes about 90 seconds.

**3. Connect to a server in the country whose library you want.** Want US Netflix? Pick a US server. Want Japanese anime? Tokyo server. Pretty intuitive.

**4. Restart Netflix completely.** And I mean *completely*. On mobile, force-close the app. On desktop, shut down your entire browser, not just the tab. Netflix caches your location aggressively, and if you skip this step you'll keep seeing your old library and wonder why nothing changed.

>**Pro tip that saves headaches:** Before connecting your VPN, figure out *which* country has the show you want. A free tool called **uNoGS** (unogs.com) lets you search Netflix's global catalog across all 190+ regions. Search for the title, see exactly which countries carry it, then connect to that server. Way better than playing VPN roulette.

# The 2026 Catch: Netflix's Detection Has Gotten Scary Good

Here's what most of these guides won't tell you: Netflix's VPN-blocking game has leveled up *hard* since 2024.

Netflix now uses IP address blacklisting, traffic pattern analysis, and enhanced proxy detection to identify VPN usage almost instantly. They're not just checking if your IP belongs to a known VPN provider anymore. They're analyzing *how* your traffic behaves — things like multiple users sharing one IP address, mismatches between your DNS location and your IP geolocation, and patterns that look like encrypted tunnel traffic rather than normal browsing.

And then there are the newer restrictions that catch people off guard:

|Restriction|What Happens|Workaround|
|:-|:-|:-|
|❌ **Ad-supported plan**|VPN use flat-out isn't allowed on ad-supported plans|Upgrade to Standard or Premium|
|❌ **Live events**|No VPN allowed during Netflix live content|Must connect directly, no workaround|
|⚠️ **Detected VPN**|Netflix shows only globally-licensed Originals|Switch servers or use obfuscation|
|⚠️ **Proxy error**|Error code `m7111-1331-5059` appears|Clear cookies, try different server|

That ad-supported plan thing is a *huge* gotcha. If you picked Netflix's cheapest tier to save money (and honestly, who can blame you), VPNs straight up won't work. Netflix blocks them by design on that plan because advertisers pay for geographically targeted audiences, and a VPN completely breaks that model. You'll need to bump up to at least the Standard plan before any of this works.

# Which VPNs Actually Still Work? (Tested Late 2025)

I'm going to be blunt: most VPNs fail with Netflix in 2026. The cat-and-mouse game between VPN providers and Netflix's detection team has gotten so intense that only a few providers with enormous server networks and dedicated engineering teams can keep up.

Based on testing across multiple review sites through late 2025 and early 2026:

|VPN|Server Count|Countries|Netflix Regions Unlocked|Protocol|Standout Feature|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**NordVPN**|8,900+|129+|🔥 15+ confirmed|`NordLynx`|SmartPlay auto-unblocking|
|**ExpressVPN**|3,000+|105|✅ 10+ confirmed|`Lightway`|Router firmware (Aircove)|
|**Surfshark**|3,200+|100+|✅ 10+ confirmed|`WireGuard`|Unlimited devices + rotating IPs|
|**ProtonVPN**|4,500+|110+|✅ 8+ confirmed|`Stealth`|Open-source, privacy-first|
|**CyberGhost**|11,000+|100+|⚠️ 16+ (variable)|`WireGuard`|Dedicated streaming servers|

A few thoughts on these, because I don't think the comparison table tells the whole story.

NordVPN keeps showing up at the top of basically every Netflix roundup, and in this case the consensus tracks with reality. With over 8,000 RAM-only servers across 120+ countries, it rotates IP addresses frequently enough to stay ahead of Netflix's blocking. The SmartPlay feature is particularly clever — it works on devices that don't natively support VPNs, like certain smart TVs and gaming consoles, by automatically handling the DNS routing in the background.

ExpressVPN charges more (it's always been the premium option), but the `Lightway` protocol is genuinely fast, and being the only major provider with its own router firmware means you can protect *every* device in your house without installing apps on each one. Users rarely need to switch servers to find one that works, which is a bigger deal than it sounds when you're just trying to watch a movie after a long day and don't want to play the server-hop game.

Surfshark is the budget pick that consistently punches above its weight. It expanded its dedicated IP feature to 20 locations in 2025 and offers a rotating IP option that automatically changes your address at set intervals — useful for avoiding Netflix's pattern detection. And unlimited simultaneous connections means your whole household streams on one subscription.

>**Real talk:** Free VPNs almost never work for Netflix. Free VPN services simply cannot afford to spend the time, money, and effort required to stay ahead of Netflix's blocks. They also tend to come with slower speeds, data caps, and privacy concerns that make them a bad trade. I'd rather pay $3-4/month for a budget provider than trust a free service that's monetizing my data instead.

# Troubleshooting: When It Doesn't Work (And It Won't, Sometimes)

Even with a good VPN, you'll hit the proxy error eventually. It's not a matter of *if* — it's *when*. Here's the playbook, roughly in order of how likely each fix is to solve your problem:

**Switch servers.** This fixes it probably 70% of the time. Netflix blocked *that specific IP*, not your entire VPN. Most providers have dozens of servers per country — just pick a different one in the same region.

**Nuke your cookies and cache.** Netflix remembers your previous location through browser cookies. If you connected to the VPN after loading Netflix, your old location data is still cached. Clear everything, restart, reconnect.

**Enable obfuscation.** Most premium VPNs have a stealth mode or obfuscated server option that disguises VPN traffic as regular HTTPS browsing. Obfuscation is crucial for disguising VPN traffic as regular connections to avoid Netflix's detection. In NordVPN, look for the obfuscated servers. In Surfshark, it's called NoBorders mode. In ExpressVPN, obfuscation happens automatically.

**Try a dedicated/static IP.** Shared IP addresses get flagged faster because hundreds of users stream Netflix through them simultaneously. A dedicated IP — one that's exclusively yours — is far less likely to be blacklisted. Most providers offer this as an add-on for a few extra dollars monthly.

**Switch protocols.** If `WireGuard` is getting blocked, try `OpenVPN`. Some networks and Netflix detection systems are better at identifying certain protocol signatures. It's slower, but it might sneak through.

**Check your plan.** I cannot stress this enough — if you're on the ad-supported tier, nothing will work. Netflix's ad-supported subscriptions do not allow VPN access by design. Upgrade first.

# What About Smart DNS? Does That Still Work?

Sort of. And I'm being generous with ""sort of.""

Smart DNS services reroute only the DNS queries that reveal your location, without encrypting your full traffic. The upside: zero speed loss, since your actual data isn't being tunneled through a remote server. The downside: no encryption, no real privacy protection, and Netflix has gotten much better at detecting these too.

Some VPN providers bundle Smart DNS as a feature — NordVPN calls theirs SmartPlay, ExpressVPN has MediaStreamer. These integrated versions tend to work more reliably than standalone Smart DNS services because the VPN company actively maintains them alongside their main product.

But standalone Smart DNS? I'd skip it in 2026. Netflix's detection has moved well beyond simple DNS checking, and without the obfuscation and IP rotation that VPNs provide, a Smart DNS service is basically bringing a knife to a gunfight.

# Is This Legal? The Honest Answer

Yes. With an asterisk.

Using a VPN to change your Netflix region violates Netflix's Terms of Service, but it's not illegal in the US or in most other countries. The distinction matters. Netflix could theoretically cancel your account for violating their ToS, but in practice, they've never done this. Netflix typically responds to VPN detection by blocking access rather than banning accounts.

The worst that happens? You see the proxy error, Netflix limits you to globally-available Originals, and you disconnect the VPN and go back to your normal library. Nobody's getting sued. Nobody's getting fined. Netflix would rather keep collecting your subscription money than kick you off the platform.

That said — and I want to be clear about this — VPN legality varies by country. VPNs themselves are restricted or outright banned in places like China, Russia, Belarus, Iran, and a handful of others. If you're in one of those countries, the legal calculus is different and you should research local laws before proceeding.

# Device-Specific Quirks You Should Know About

Not every device plays nice with VPNs the same way, and this trips people up constantly.

|Device|VPN Setup Method|Difficulty|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|💻 Laptop/Desktop|Native VPN app|Easy|Works on all browsers. Clear cache after connecting|
|📱 iPhone/Android|VPN app from App Store|Easy|Force-quit Netflix app after connecting|
|📺 Smart TV (newer)|VPN app (if supported)|Medium|Some Android TVs have native apps; others need router setup|
|📺 Smart TV (older)|Router-level VPN|Hard|Install VPN on router to cover all devices|
|🎮 Game Console|Router-level VPN or Smart DNS|Hard|PS5/Xbox don't support VPN apps natively|
|🔥 Fire TV Stick|VPN app from Amazon Store|Easy|NordVPN, ExpressVPN, Surfshark all have Fire TV apps|
|🍎 Apple TV|VPN app (tvOS)|Medium|Proton VPN's tvOS app added city-level server selection in late 2025|

The router approach deserves a mention because it solves basically every compatibility problem at once. Install the VPN on your router, and *everything* connected to your WiFi — smart TVs, consoles, streaming sticks, your weird smart fridge — automatically routes through the VPN. ExpressVPN's Aircove router comes pre-configured for this. NordVPN and Surfshark both have setup guides for popular router firmware like DD-WRT and OpenWrt.

# The Password Sharing Angle Nobody Mentions

Here's something that's been quietly relevant since Netflix's password-sharing crackdown. Netflix now uses your IP address to define what counts as a ""household."" The password sharing ban limits account use to devices located within the same household, and they verify this through IP geolocation.

If you're already using a VPN to change your Netflix country, you need to be aware that switching locations frequently might trigger Netflix's sharing detection. Suddenly you're ""watching from Japan"" one day and ""watching from Canada"" the next — that looks a lot like account sharing to Netflix's systems.

NordVPN's Meshnet feature is worth noting here. It lets you route traffic from multiple devices through a single IP address, which can make it look like all your devices are in the same location even when they're not. Clever workaround, though Netflix could potentially catch on to this too.

# FAQ: Quick Answers

**Will Netflix ban my account for using a VPN?** No. They'll block the VPN connection and show you the proxy error, but they don't terminate accounts over VPN use. Your subscription stays active.

**Can I use a free VPN for Netflix?** Technically possible, practically useless. Free VPNs get blocked almost immediately, impose data caps that can't handle streaming, and often sell your browsing data. Not worth the trade.

**Which country has the best Netflix library?** Depends what you watch. The US has the deepest catalog of Hollywood content and Originals. Japan dominates anime. The UK and Canada carry strong British and international selections. European countries like Iceland surprisingly have some of the largest overall libraries.

**Does changing Netflix country affect my account?** No. Your account, billing, and profile settings stay exactly the same. You're just seeing a different content catalog based on your apparent location. Disconnect the VPN and everything goes back to normal.

**Why does Netflix keep detecting my VPN?** Netflix invests heavily in VPN detection. If you're getting blocked frequently, try: switching servers, enabling obfuscation, using a dedicated IP, or clearing your browser cache before reconnecting.

# Bottom Line

Changing your Netflix country is one of those things that's conceptually simple and occasionally annoying in practice. The method hasn't fundamentally changed — connect a VPN, pick a server, restart Netflix — but Netflix's ability to detect and block VPNs has gotten sophisticated enough that your choice of provider *really* matters now.

If you want the path of least resistance: grab NordVPN or ExpressVPN, connect, and don't overthink it. If you're budget-conscious, Surfshark does the job for roughly the price of a fancy coffee per month. And whatever you do, make sure you're not on the ad-supported plan, because no VPN on earth will help you there.

The global Netflix library has over 13,000 titles. Your country's version probably has less than half of that. A decent VPN and four minutes of setup is all that stands between you and the rest.",1,1771250768.0,PrivacyCompass,0,1.0,False

**☕ Why coffee chain suppliers might be the hidden play in 2026**

The remarkable growth of **Dutch Bros (BROS)** has ignited renewed investor interest in the **coffee chain ecosystem,** from cafes and franchisors to the underlying suppliers that feed into roasting, equipment, and retail distribution. As consumer spending on premium coffee continues to expand globally, this “coffee economy” extends far beyond a single brand.

# What’s driving the Dutch Bros Effect:

* **Brand-led acceleration:** Dutch Bros has seen strong comparable store sales and rapid expansion, proving demand for high-growth, experience-driven caffeine brands remains robust.
* **Shifting consumer habits:** Premium coffee and beverage consumption has outpaced expectations, especially among younger demographics who favor convenience and quality.
* **Supply chain leverage:** Growth at coffee chains translates into rising demand for *coffee beans, roasting, packaging, machines, POS systems, and logistics partners*.

# Why suppliers may outperform:

• **Commodity demand tailwinds:** Strong café and espresso-based drink growth often increases demand for coffee beans and processing equipment.  
• **Recurring revenue models:** Equipment leasing, replacement parts, and B2B services with recurring contracts can boost margin stability.  
• **Scale and pricing power:** Suppliers supporting multiple café brands can benefit from scale economies and pricing leverage.

# Sectors to watch:

• **Coffee bean producers and traders** (exposure to Arabica and Robusta markets)  
• **Equipment manufacturers** (espresso machines, grinders, brewing systems)  
• **Packaging and logistics** (cans, cold brew, single-serve, distribution networks)  
• **Tech & services** (POS systems and loyalty platforms integrated into café workflows)

Investors often focus on the *face of the brand*, but the real engine of sustained growth lies deeper in the **supply chain** and that’s where opportunities for outsized returns can emerge. The Dutch Bros effect highlights how **category growth can lift suppliers and service providers behind the scenes**.

I was half awake, doing that morning shuffle across my cold floor like a little zombie who only wants coffee and mercy. I grabbed socks from the chair pile, which is where clean laundry goes when it gives up on being folded, and I didn’t even look. I just felt fabric, pulled them on, and slid into my sneakers. The first sign something was off came when I tied my laces and my left foot felt… cushioned, like it had a tiny mattress under it. The right foot felt normal, almost suspiciously normal, like it was missing something. I took one step and my brain did that tiny alert noise it does when you forget your phone, except my phone was in my hand. I sat on the edge of the bed and checked. One sock was a thick winter one with that tight ribbed cuff that leaves a little ring on your ankle, and the other was a thin everyday sock that somehow always ends up slightly twisted by noon. I considered fixing it right there, but the cold floor was doing its own little intimidation routine and I told myself it was fine, I was already late, it’s just socks, stop being dramatic. Then I stood up and realised the mismatch felt bigger once I started walking. The thin sock kept sliding a bit, so my toes felt like they were negotiating with the inside of my shoe, while the winter sock was gripping my foot like a gentle but firm handshake. All day I had this weird sense that I was walking slightly uneven, not enough for anyone to notice, but enough for me to notice every single step. Like my body was a chair with one leg 2 millimeters shorter. I kept thinking people could hear it, as if my feet were making different sound effects. At work I caught myself doing these micro adjustments, shifting weight, retying laces, pretending I was just stretching. At lunch I had my shoes off under the table for a second, wiggling my toes like I was trying to solve a tiny puzzle with my feet. The winter sock’s cuff was also slowly winning its war against my ankle, that tight elastic bite that isn’t painful but feels judgemental. Meanwhile the thin sock was rolling down in the back, making a little ridge that I could feel every time I took a step. The worst part is I had multiple chances to fix it. I could have swapped them in a bathroom stall. I could have gone to a store and bought a cheap pair. I could have done anything, but I carried on like this was my assigned quest for the day, and the only rule was to pretend it was normal. By the time I got home I almost didn’t want to change them, because then the glitch would be over and I’d have nothing to privately laugh about. I finally peeled them off and my feet looked the same, my day was the same, nobody knew, but I felt like I’d been walking around with a secret little wrongness tucked into my shoes, and honestly it was kind of comforting in a silly way.

This is the first season of the New Era, and they became increasingly difficult to find unique facts about and write about. I also don't agree with/believe in ""Earn the Merge"" and therefore put the first person voted out after the tribes did merge (but didn't according to Probst) on the merged tribe.

My question: how progressive would you describe Columbia? (Doesn't have to be ""liberal"", I'm thinking more ""y'all means all"" type vibes). Are there neighborhoods/areas that are particularly good (or not good) for progressive values? 

My sense is that Columbia is decently progressive, but would like to hear it from folks who live there, particularly regarding finding community. Our family originally moved from Midwest towns where not being ""churchy"" was akin to social ostracizing. Raising our family in an inclusive environment is important to us. We are not particularly religious (but we do enjoy singing in choirs, including sacred rep) and prefer to spend our time at bookstores, coffee shops, community volunteer events, and outdoors.

Just wanted to share a few quick tips for when you’re in a situation that isn’t ideal.

Obviously, vet them beforehand. But I understand some of them can perform decency long enough to secure the date. So instead of waiting for them to slip up, set things up so they don't get an opening in the first place.

When I confirm plans, I always say something like “I have time for a quick dinner” or ""I can do a quick coffee"". Since you've already capped the duration, he knows access is limited and for the most part, will act accordingly.

Also side note: push to meet midday or early evening. If he suggests 9–10 pm dinner, negotiate earlier. Darkness makes some of them forget their haya.

Sit in a way that forces decency. If you can, make sure you sit across from them. By doing this, you're creating distance and removing the opportunity for him to try anything. It's quite shocking how much inappropriate touching is prevented simply by seating position.

Make sure you set your boundaries very clearly in the beginning. If you don't like physical contact, state it firmly and early on in the conversation. Most men will self correct when they know you’re paying attention. Now if he tests you later, he knows he’s violating a boundary. In that case, you don't owe any explanations. Get up and leave.

I also mention that my older brother has my location and is overly protective. Doesn’t even have to be true. The point is he knows you're accounted for.

Bring up things in conversation that make him aware he’s being evaluated. Mention that you respect men who are disciplined or that you can’t deal with men who can't handle rejection.

Lastly, end the date first. Don't linger to see if he’ll escalate physically at the goodbye. You need to remove the window entirely.

Bonus tip: if you absolutely have to get in a car with him and you’ve exhausted every other option, at some point make it clear someone is expecting you. Call your brother (or whoever). Say where you are, that you’re on the way home, how far you are. Even tell your date, “He said salaam.”

If he's smart, he won’t move recklessly in a situation that can be traced back to him within minutes.

Hope this helps. Feel free to add anything I've missed.",5,1771250288.0,SomaliRelationships,1,1.0,False

I can’t gain weight, whenever I do put on a kilo, I get hit with a flare and I lose it again. I’m underweight and I just haven’t been able to gain anything properly since I had the vaccine. In 2022/2023 is when I noticed the rapid weight loss due to someone we know literally pointing it out and then I’m like “oh yeah, I have been getting diarrhoea every day” and we went to the doctor. First doctor, we did manage to get a colonoscopy and endoscopy but of course, I happened to not be in a flare up at that time so nothing came up on the scans which is so frustrating. I have another doctor now and he’s a lot more concerned for me and has even rang an ambulance on me when I was at the doctors but they didn’t do much because my vitals are fine, thankfully. I’m back to square one where I’m losing weight, can’t keep anything in but I’m so sick of the low FODMAP diet. I am somewhat lucky I guess that I’ve been a coffee drinker since 18-19 so I don’t think coffee makes much of a difference but I am noticing that Coca Cola does. Anyway, back to my original question.

1r6a6a7,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1r6a6a7/grinder_2000_traditional_spro_focused/,"Grinder [$2000], traditional spro focused","Hello, I'm looking for a grinder that would pair well with a Flair 58+2. Not that I have one yet but this is a planned upgrade to work with the new grinder. 

I normally enjoy high clarity pourover and use a pietro and Ode 2. However, I generally prefer more traditional espresso in terms of medium to medium-dark roasts. Focusing on syrupy texture, chocolate/caramel notes with a touch of fruit, like what would be experienced in high quality dark chocolate. I generally only do straight espresso shots, and rarely have milk drinks.

The grinder should be very good at these traditional profiles, but also something that can at least decently perform with more modern light roasts coffees for the occasional cups. It would also be nice if it would be decent at pourover. I know the trend is somewhat demarcated in terms of what grinders specialize in, which is why I prioritize trad shots, and only need something decent in other areas.

Also, low-retention single dosing is preferable as I do enjoy switching from bean to bean every cup, but if an on demand grinder is really that good, i.e All Ground/ Eureka Atom, then that is fine as well.

Burr interchangeability is not that big of a concern as long as it meets most of the criteria. Only thing is that the alignment should be good out of the box, I would really prefer not to futz around with an EK43 alignment situation.

Aesthetics are a big point for me. If I'm dropping that much money on something it should bring me some sort of joy every day using it. Which is why I like the HG-2 and Orbit, but am a bit biased against the Philos because it looks like a meat grinder (No offense intended if this is your aesthetic). 

Grinders I have been considering are:
Weber HG-2 (main contender),
Lagom P64,
Philos i189 burrs,
Niche Zero (not too much because I still want filter coffee perfomance),
Weber Key Mk.2,
Acaia Orbit 33M (SSP LS v3?? (yay or nay?))

TLDR requests:
- High priority trad shots with syrupy body
- Occasional modern spro and filter coffee
- Single-dose preferred
- Good out of box alignment

I’m 22 and currently studying Biology + Industrial Engineering (with a focus around ecology and nutritional science). I live a pretty structured, disciplined life, but lately I’ve been pushing myself to be more open to new experiences, different perspectives, and meaningful connections.

I’m a slim nerdy masc guy, 5'8"", based in Indonesia. I’m looking for a long-term relationship, I’m really into lifelong learning and “real” conversations, life topics, ideas, plans, random interesting facts, deep talks… anything that makes the brain happy.

Music-wise, my taste is all over the place: pop, alternative, rock, country, orchestral, and folk. For hobbies, I read sci-fi, I draw imaginary maps and city plannings (yes, I’m that kind of nerd), and I’m a beginner at traveling but I want to explore more. Biology fieldwork also gets me outdoors often, so I love discovering Indonesia’s nature whenever I can.

I’m also into food adventures and healthy living (not vegetarian). Recently I’ve been doing a lot of cardio. I’ve had a retinal detachment before, so I avoid activities that could strain my eyes or put them at risk.

For fun I love memes, cats, and PC games like Stardew Valley, Fall Guys, TheHunter, Terraria, and Minecraft (I don’t play them every day due to uni). I enjoy horror movies, and I watch a bit of anime too! Chainsaw Man, Azumanga Daioh, Demon Slayer, Haikyuu!!, Gachiakuta, Dr. Stone, Naruto, Pokémon (I want to rewatch), and Doraemon. Also… I genuinely enjoy drinking coffee and matcha at the same time

I’m big on mindful tech use too: phone detox, productivity, deep focus time, and being present offline. It’s a huge plus if you relate. I’m an early bird, I keep a routine, and I plan my days carefully because I genuinely believe time is precious, and I want to live intentionally.

Most importantly, I want new friends who can truly respect, understand, accept, and appreciate each other as we are. I’m ISTP, I like growth and moving forward together, and I’m big on planning/organizing, so I hope you’re comfortable with that. If you’re extroverted, I might be shy at first; if you’re introverted, that’s totally fine too. I also don’t mind if we have different interests, as long as there’s understanding, respect, and good communication.

If you’ve read this far and think we might vibe, please don’t just say “Hi.”

Before I even reached the counter, she looked up and smiled. “Oat milk latte, light ice?” She didn’t check the screen. She just knew. Last week she had even handed me a cookie and said, “This pairs perfectly with oat milk.” Today she was already reaching for the carton.

I laughed and nodded at first. Then I heard myself say, kind of casually, “Actually I’m allergic to regular milk. That’s the only reason.” I said it lightly, like I was correcting a detail on a receipt. She blinked, then immediately said, “Oh my god, I’m so glad we’ve been using oat milk.” She looked concerned for a second, then relieved. We both laughed. She still made the drink exactly the same.

In that moment I felt oddly exposed. Not ashamed, just… unmasked. You know that feeling when someone assigns you a personality trait and you let it stick because it’s cute? I realized I’d been enjoying being the oat milk girl. It felt curated, intentional. Saying “it’s an allergy” felt less aesthetic. More medical. More plain.

Here’s the thing. I have this pattern of letting small misunderstandings live if they make me look more put together. There’s something very cultural about that. We turn preferences into identity markers. Almond milk, black coffee, extra hot, no foam. It becomes shorthand for who we are. And especially as women, we get read through tiny consumption details all the time. I didn’t want to disrupt her sweet narrative of me.

In 20 years I have not had a single issue with it. It makes her happy and I enjoy watching her perform. This last year things changed. I have never felt like he was a threat to our marriage up til then. The looks, the not-so innocent touches. This all coming from him and my wife did nothing that made me uncomfortable. I confronted her anyway. She claims to see none of what I see. She let me look at their texts. More red flags like him texting out of the blue, ""have I told you lately you da bomb"". 
 Anyway, she missed some important family events last year and we talked about setting boundaries. Recently he asked about an upcoming gig that falls on an important date so I reached out to him. She had already said no to this date. My 1st message was a little harsh but I followed up with an explanation about the things she missed last year. I expected this to open dialogue about scheduling conflicts. Instead, he messaged both of us and included his wife. He ended the singing relationship and their 20 year friendship. He (they?) said never to contact either of them ever again. He and his wife then blocked both of us from all social media. My wife is obviously devastated and blames me for his extreme response. I suspect his wife saw what I saw, seized the opportunity and forced his hand. My wife just thinks it's all my fault. Honestly?

1r69v1e,https://www.reddit.com/r/MotherGrim/comments/1r69v1e/three_jacks/,Three Jacks,"Three Jack Straws

Jack Straw first came to Witchita on his way up to the Badlands.  He had donuts at Wall Drugs and coffee, then told his partner he was going to go on a journey by himself to take drone photos.  If she needed him, he had his Ring on in and could be reached by it.

Jack didn’t realize that trip to the Badlands had picked him up more than Wild Licorice burrs - remote viewers were monitoring him from that point onward.  Unbeknownst to him he had entered a special satellite zone in the Badlands that let people sync into his Ring.

It’s only The Smiley’s .. well, at first that is.  And The Smiley’s are rather benign as far as hacker groups go because they are mostly focused on pranks & ecojustice.  

The Smileys sync into people’s Rings as what can be described as a public service announcement.  The Smileys are actually dedicated to trying to break humans out of the rut of their hohum internet existence by doing very mild pranks on people.

It’s just that They Smileys use a certain laser that connects the ground near them in Russia to this complex web in the sky.   The problem? Well, eventually other hackers tap into the laser and break into the stolen data.

So this isn’t fully the fault of the SpyCracker, that’s name of the couple, that invented this laser and meant to use it for good.  The noble goal of them and The Smiley’s both being to end carbon emissions, clean the Earth and stop fossil fuel wars.  They are good people. 

It’s the people around them  … that’s the problem.

They’ve been banished to the remote part of Siberia where numerous governments have been illegally dumping prisoners, vigilantes, and unwanted people on the sly.   It’s a no man’s land. 

Once all criminals around the Spycracker break into the Ring - it’s all over.  They all then use the sky satellites to track people and sell their data  and whereabouts on the dark web to criminals all over the world. 

And indeed that’s how Jack Straw had criminals following him after he got home from Badlands.  He didn’t, at first, understand why so many strange things kept happening to him.

Once Jack started to wonder about the sheer amount of robberies, hackings, data breaches and break-ins he’d experienced in six months, he did alert the authorities. 

But the local authorities brushed it off and made him feel crazy for thinking he was marked as a target by an unknown, invisible entity,  When he went to discuss it with his psychologist, she made a note in his files about delusions grandeur and psychosis, then started him on new medicine.

Jack Straw then started to encounter deepfakes of himself.  At first, he didn’t realize that someone was impersonating but then one of the deepfakes had information that only he and his wife would know.  

It was at that time that Jack started to realize that something was watching him.  He burnt his phone and his Ring in a bonfire in his back yard while his neighbor’s dogs watched him nervously.  Jack felt free of the watchers.

1r69rq5,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1r69rq5/espresso_machine_recommendations_in_uk_to_upgrade/,Espresso Machine Recommendations in UK to upgrade from a Bambino plus [£1500],"Hey all, currently 2 years into owning a Sage Bambino plus & Varia VS3 Grinder. I’ve got the itch to upgrade my espresso machine to the next level. The bambino is such a capable machine for its price point but there are a few features it lacks that I’m looking for in my next machine: PID Control, better build quality, temp stability, cup space and more aesthetically pleasing, 58mm gasket seeing as it’s the go-to for most prosumer models. Some nice to haves would be flow control/pressure profiling to have more variable control. 

Now, important context: I’m the sole coffee drinker in my household, I have 2 flat whites a day (rarely ever back-to-back) and occasionally make drinks for family or friends when they come over. Im looking for a sensible footprint and it’ll live under a kitchen cupboard so approx 42cm height restriction. I’m UK based and have a budget of up to £1,500 but happy to cut costs where possible. 

I’ve done a lot of research, delving into many forums/Reddit threads, as well as a ton of YouTube videos, watching detailed reviews from trusted creators such as Lance Hedrick and the goat himself: Hoffmann. So, I’ve got a bit of an understanding around what I should be looking for within that price range. I’ve listed some potential machines below with opinions on their stock forms, but I’m keen for advice and also suggestions that I may not have considered. 

# Profitec Go - £850-900

**Pros:**

Small footprint, build quality, parts availability, aesthetic, PID control, price, heat up time. 

**Cons:**

No pre-infusion, Single boiler (might not be as big of an issue with lack of b2b drinks), plastic parts for drip tray (was to counter rattle issue on older gen but not a fan), steam wand not as powerful as the bambino plus.

# QuickMill Pop Up - £900

**Pros:**

Price, PID control, heat up time, flow control, pre-infusion, the side slotted water tank and silicon intake tubes are genius! Especially for me having cupboards above would make work flow easier, cup storage.

**Cons:**

Single boiler, fairly new model hasn’t stood the test of time yet, QA issues potentially, milk wand also not as good as bambino plus and awful design even with the revised models.

# Lelit Mara X - £1200/1300

**Pros:**

PID system, pre-infusion, aesthetically one of the better options, quiet pump, E61 old but gold, parts availability. 

**Cons:**

No flow control out the box, HX although one of the better ones it may be a shock to me coming from instant thermoblock tech waiting 30 or so minutes for 1 coffee at a time isn’t time or cost effective, not sure if high ownership has made for a lot of QA noise on Reddit and that it’s owned by Breville/Sage now but I’m skeptical on build quality, E61/HX maintenance 

# Lelit Elizabeth - £1200

**Pros:**

Dual Boiler most reliable for temp stability, feature rich brewing options, PID control, pre-infusion, parts availability and community 

**Cons:**

Large footprint but is compact for DB, same with the Mara I’m skeptical on QA, see a lot of leak issues with the water tank and valves, may be overkill for a solo drinker, not the nicest machine to look at, no manual flow control. 

**Conclusion**

I don’t think any of these machines are a “bad” pick, and a lot of it is subjective and preference driven. But there’s too much out there online, it actually makes it really hard to decide…so any opinions, advice, alternative suggestions would be appreciated. I’m not looking for my end game machine but nor do I want a piece of kit that will be no good after 2/3 years as I appreciate longevity and quality driven machines that are a joy to work with everyday.

I am struggling to cope. We have help, outside services to help me with the care. But it is taking a toll on my mentally and physically. 

This has been magnified by a recent friend that I have made. Who happens to be [F30]. We are all friends but she is technically my friend who I met. I want to hang out with her, like friends do, just coffee or a walk, nothing more. But my wife is jealous, understandably. 

But there is nothing to be jealous of, I just have a friend that is not me being a carer. It's a nice mental break from constantly being in ""care mode"". 

My wife has asked me to ask her before I ask to hang out with the friend, fair enough. But I can never do it right, it's always taken like I'm trying to do it in a suspicious way. 

I feel suffocated. I don't have any other friends or outlets. 

I just want us all to be friends, even if that includes us all hanging out together.

I know men and women struggle to be friends without sexual tension but that's not always the case.

What am I supposed to do? I don't want to resent my wife and I don't want to one day decide I've had enough. 

I love my wife and I'm happy to bear the responsibility of her care, even though it is exhausting to me sometimes - didn't sleep for 5 days during a recent hospital stay.

I’m planning a trip to Korea for about three weeks starting in late April. I haven't pulled the trigger on flights yet, so I’m still pretty flexible with my dates as long as it fits my budget.

I’m not looking to rush from point A to point B just to check attractions off a list. 

My goal is to actually feel the places I visit; I want to hit up local markets, prepare some food, keep up with my gym routine, and just spend time walking and exploring cool coffee shops.

I definitely prefer city vibes over nature (I figure Jeju will give me my nature fix!), so here is the rough plan:

* Seoul (7 nights): Including the DMZ, and maybe day trips to Suwon or Incheon if I’m feeling it.
* Gyeongju (3 nights)
* Busan (6 nights)
* Jeju Island (5 nights)

I’ve seen Sokcho and Jeonju mentioned a lot. Is it worth the extra travel time to squeeze them in, or should I stick to my current slow-paced plan?

Does this seem like a solid 3-week itinerary for someone who wants to soak it all in rather than rush?

Typing this up from a coffee shop to try and get away from my home office. I'm going to give a bit of backstory to fill you in before I get to my question.

I have lived and worked in the Managed IT space for the last 6 years of my life. Prior to that, I was in system administration for software companies, one of which was a small local company of 10 or so people. I loved working at MSPs (Managed Service Providers). It was a crazy mix of never doing the same thing, learning everything about IT, but it also ended up leading to major burnout. I switched companies at the end of 2024 for a change of scenery, but it was more of the same. My entrepreneur side was tired of fulfilling other people's dreams. So, in February 2025 I left the MSP and started my own IT Consulting company in the MSP space. I signed my first client that same month before I even got my LLC done.

Now we're at August 2025 and I just finished a project for a client that brought up a pain I had forgotten about in the MSP space. DNS and domain management. So I started throwing out the idea of how that could be solved. There's tools out there like EasyDmarc, PowerDmarc, and Zone Watcher. They're great tools, but none of them really solve the problem. 

The problem is this:

MSPs handle IT for other businesses. Generally, an MSP will have their niches they serve. Some serve lawfirms and other legal service, some serve manufacturing companies, etc etc. Regardless of their niche, their clients have registered their domains generally wherever was cheapest at the time. GoDaddy, Cloudflare, Porkbok, NameCheap, Network Solutions.. The list goes on. Now that MSP has to document all of those different platforms, their passwords, and how each platform differs for the MSPs documentation on items like changing DNS records, setting up DMARC, DKIM, and SPF, domain expiration date, if auto-renew is turned on, the list goes on.

Over the last 6 months I've put time into an app to solve that. Unified DNS (https://udns.app). I've been fortunate enough to work with several MSPs along this development process. It's given me data and feedback on how to make it work for a general workflow that works for the industry. I've targeted the end of this month for Go To Market/Go-Live. I've reached out to a few different conferences in the space to see about sponsoring them as a way to get the name and product out there, I've been posting on LinkedIn, I've tried Apollo, I've made posts on the MSP subreddit weekly promo thread, I've even had one of my consulting clients sign-on to use it once it's live (and they even asked me if I had considered taking or accepting investments) but I'm sort of.. stuck on my go-live strategy.

So my question: How does one go about handling outreach and marketing for a product that serves a niche market like Managed Service Providers? I've refined my SEO, over the last 2 months I've made relevant blog posts on the UDNS website, I've made comparison articles for the 3 platforms I mentioned earlier, I review my Google Search and Rybbit analytics.. What else is there to help gain some more traction?

I’ve been on my pour-over coffee journey for about a year now, and for my anniversary, I want to treat myself by upgrading to an espresso machine. I’m thinking of getting a Flair, but I’m not sure which one is best for me.

In the future, I plan to use medium roast beans (Omni or Max) for my espresso. So, I’m wondering which Flair model would be the best fit for that type of coffee.

I’m currently deciding between the **Flair Pro 3** or the **Flair 58 OG** with the electronic upgrade. I prefer separated electric hardware, in case something breaks, it’s easier to replace.

From what I’ve read, the **Flair Pro 3** has some issues with temperature stability because it relies on preheating, but it’s built better and has less plastic than the 58. On the other hand, the **Flair 58** has better temperature control and workflow, but the downside is that it’s a bit pricier and you might end up spending more on accessories.

By the way, I’m still using my hand grinder, so I don’t plan to go for darker, oily roasted beans, which is why I’m sticking to lighter-medium roasts.

If you have experience with either of these, I’d love to hear your opinion or maybe even be *deinfluenced* if I’m leaning the wrong way!

We were at a small cafe with two of her friends and one of their friends I’d never met. Like, friendly vibe, normal talk, nothing heavy. Then the topic turned into “people who can’t handle criticism” and one of them joked about guys who get defensive. My girlfriend laughed and goes, “oh my god, yeah, like him. he’s always like that,” and then she starts telling this little story about me that was basically… my private insecurity dressed up as a funny anecdote. Not like medical or anything, but still a personal thing I’ve told her in confidence, and the way she framed it made me sound childish. I kinda froze because it felt like I got shoved into the center of the table without warning.

At first I tried to brush it off, like I did that fake smile thing and said “okay, babe” hoping she’d take the hint. But she kept going, and the stranger guy did that awkward half chuckle like he didn’t know if he was allowed to laugh. I leaned in and quietly said “please stop, seriously” and she looked at me like I was dramatic and just goes “what, I’m just giving an example.” I said again, more firmly, “I’m asking you to stop.” She rolled her eyes and said out loud, “it’s true though, he’s always like that,” and then when I looked at her she did this shrug and said “well, it IS true.” After that there was this weird quiet over the table, like everyone suddenly remembered they were alive and had mouths and didn’t wanna use them. Her friends stared at their drinks, and I could literally hear the cafe music for a second, which is not a good sign.

I didn’t yell, I didn’t storm off, I just got super cold. I paid for my coffee, said I had to get home, and left. She texted me later like “wow ok, that was embarrassing for me” which honestly made my jaw clench. I told her what was embarrassing was her taking something I trusted her with and using it as a punchline. She said she wasn’t “exposing” me, that I’m too sensitive, and that if it’s true then why can’t she say it. I asked her why my discomfort didn’t matter in that moment, why my first “stop” wasn’t enough. She kept circling back to “you made a scene by leaving.”

Now she wants me to apologize for “ruining the night” and for “punishing” her with silence because I haven’t been chatty since. I told her I’m not apologizing for setting a boundary, and that I’m still trying to figure out if I can trust her not to do that again. She says I’m turning it into a bigger issue than it is and that couples tease each other. I get teasing, I really do, but this felt like she used me to score points and then acted like I was the problem for reacting.

So yeah. AITA for refusing to apologize, and for basically digging my heels in here? I’m genuinely asking, because I don’t want to be the guy who can’t take a joke, but I also don’t wanna train myself to accept that kind of public “example” as normal.

**TL;DR = just read the passages in bold.**


Clinical physiologist Gerald Shulman and his collaborators discovered that some medical conditions often thought as permanent are reversible like switches that can be turned on and off.

If you have felt sluggish sometimes, or needing longer recovery times after training, this might explain few things.

**Starting in 1990 Shulman found that suppression of muscle glycogen synthesis is the major factor responsible for muscle insulin resistence.** Further research clarified underlying causes. These researchers hold that some mainstream models concerning metabolic pathways are incompatible with the results of their studies. 

**Shulman says that 50% of the population in the US and Europe has insulin resistence (data backed by CDC and NHANES) and that it may be the root cause behind Alzheimer's, cardiovascular disease, T2 diabetes, NAFLD.** Most people have it undiagnosed because testing fasting glucose alone doesn't mean much and symptoms may be subtle, The fact that so many people in the western world have it might be related to our diet but also to a mechanism preserved by evolution.

**We now know more of this mechanism that changes the fate of ingested carbohydrates from being converted into glycogen to being stored as fat.** An exposition of Shulman's work can be found in [this NCBI paper with about 1000 citations](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6170977/). It's not a single study it's the work of hundreds of researchers who authored thousands of papers over the last three decades, so following here are some of their points.

**Shulman explains four ways through which insulin might be regulating hepatic gluconeogenesis.**

**The first mechanism is through transcriptional regulation of the key gluconeogenic genes,** mediated most prominently by FOXO transcription factors. This is the traditional view in molecular biology books: insulin is taught to be turning off gluconeogenesis through phosphorilation of AKT which then phosphorylates FOXO1, which is then excluded from the nucleus, disabling its transcription factor activity . 

The problem with this being the predominant regulatory mechanism is threefold: you can knockout either AKT or FOXO1 and administer insulin and still turn off gluconeogenesis in fasting subjects who are totally dependent on gluconeogenesis, which means you don't need these key insulin-signaling pathways to regulate gluconeogenesis. Second problem concerns insulin's role regulating fasting hyperglycemia as they found no relationship with protein expression of these enzymes and fasting glucose. Third problem, there are now methods to quantify gluconeogenesis' flux precisely so we see we can turn it off in just five minutes, much faster than it would be expected from transcriptional mechanisms only.

**A second mechanism by which gluconeogenesis can be regulated is through alterations in substrate supply to the liver, such as glycerol.** There is no rate-control here: the more glycerol from fat breakdown in lipocytes that fluxes the liver the more glucose comes out and it's all substrate driven.

**A third mechanism is through modulation of the cytosolic redox state.** Studies by Anila Madiraju have demonstrated this is how metformin works: by increasing the cytosolic redox state metformin inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis by decreasing the conversion of lactate to pyruvate and of glycerol to dihydroxyacetone phosphate.

**A fourth mechanism is the allosteric regulation of gluconeogenesis through changes in hepatic acetyl-CoA,** which is the end product of beta oxidation and a potent allosteric activator of pyruvate corboxylase which is a key rate-controlling step in gluconeogenesis.

Normally insulin stimulates glucose transport into the muscle cell, where it is phosphorilated by hexokinase to form glucose-6-phosphate, which then through a series of steps is converted to glycogen by glycogen synthase. Each one of these steps has been at times implicated to be responsible for causing muscle insulin resistence. 

**In order to determine which step is rate-controlling Shulman's lab developed NMR methods to non-invasively measure intracellular G6P and intracellular glucose concentrations in humans. They found that both G6P and intracellular glucose concentrations in insulin resistent humans were reduced, implicating glucose transport as the rate-controlling step reponsible for impaired insulin-stimulated muscle glycogen synthesis.**

**So they next wanted to know what are the factors responsible for this abnormality.**

Shulman: ""In this regard there's a well-established association between obesity and insulin resistence and we hypothesized that maybe it's the amount of fat inside the muscle cell that is responsible for causing insulin resistence. In order to examine this hypothesis"" **""we established a proton NMR method to measure intramyocellular fat. Using this method we found that THE AMOUNT OF FAT INSIDE THE MUSCLE CELL is the best predictor for muscle insulin resistence.""**

Increasing fatty acids resulted in a profound reduction in insulin-stimulated muscle glycogen synthesis, which is associated with a decrease in G6P concentrations. Dresner measured intracellular glucose and found that increasing plasma fatty acids also resulted in reduction in intracellular glucose concentrations. Glucose wasn't even crossing the membrane because GLUT4 was the bottleneck. 

Lipid infusions creating insulin resistance in healthy subjects proved that insulin resistance is not a permanent broken state but a reversible response to ectopic fats. 

**So taken together these results demonstrated that fatty acids, not triglycerides, promote insulin resistence by inhibiting insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity. Adding fructose to these lipid infusions in healthy subjects increases insulin resistence even more, since fructose ends up in the liver and basically entirely gets funneled into the de novo lipogenesis pathway.**

In obese people adipocytes undergo hyperplasia and hypertrophy but merely as a homeostatic stress associated with increased adipocyte cell death: chemotactic signals from stressed adipocytes recruit bone-marrow-derived M1-polarized macrophages that infiltrate the adipocyte producing lypolitic cytokines such as TNF-alpha and interleukin-6, and this lypolisis in turn leads to an increased rate of fatty acids delivery to the liver, resulting in increased hepatic diacylglycerols content, PKC-epsilon activation, and inhibition of insulin-receptor kinase activity, which in turn results in reduced hepatic glycogen synthesis. 

On the other hand in skinny subjects, insulin-resistent humans with little to no fat, the liver takes over the role of subcutaneous fat and the increased acetyl-Co-A here is derived from increased rates of intrahepatic lipolysis. Therefore after a meal the liver is already flooded by DAGs because of this increased intrahepatic lipolysis, and this brings insulin resistence through impaired suppression of glucose production by insulin and suppressed insulin-stimulated hepatic glycogen synthesis, leading to POST-PRANDIAL HYPERGLYCEMIA, which can be seen as a storage failure, glucose stays in the blood. On the other hand the increase in FASTING HYPERGLYCEMIA comes from hepatic acetyl-CoA-stimulated gluconeogenesis due to the increased lipolysis, so more like failure to stop glucose production: the liver is forced to keep gluconeogenesis on.

Shulman: **""it's fat in the hepatocyte. If I depict two molecules that are driving metabolic disease it's acetyl-CoA driving pyruvate carboxylase and again the dyacilglycerols activating epsilon. and again it's the epsilon that drives insulin resistence.""**

Fatty acids are continuosly being delivered to the muscle cell directly or even through hydrolysis of triglycerides through lipoprotein-lipase. When this flux of fatty acids exceeds the ability of mitochondria to oxidize the fat you get net accumulation of diacylglycerols.

Thus Shulman was able to dissociate triglycerides from this process, triglycerides are a good marker if it's not possible to directly measure DAG, diacylglycerol content. Triglycerides are just a three-carbon glycerol backbone with three fatty acids and it's a most efficient way to store energy, but diacylglycerols have only two fatty acids. These two fatty acids sits on the membrane biolayer, whereas the hydrophilic hydroxyl group that DAGs have instead of the third fatty acid of triglycerides sits in the cytoplasm, and that's what pulls the novel PKCs to the plasma membrane. 

So when there's fatty acids flux imbalance, fatty acid uptake vs oxidation capacity in mitochondria, you get activation of two novel PKCs theta in muscles and epsilon in the liver. Theta blocks insulin action somewhere between IRS-1 and tyrosine phosphorilation, and epsilon directly binds to and inhibits insulin-receptor-kinase activity.


**Why the heck epsilon inhibits insulin-receptor-kinase activity?**

**Why this exists may have had evolutionary importance, a fitness advantage for survival during starvation. These researchers found that PKC-epsilon phosphorilates the insulin receptor on Threonine-1160.**

**This is important not just because Threonine-1160 is in the catalytic domain of insulin-receptor-kinase, but because it's a threonine that has been conserved throughout evolution in many wildly distant species from humans to fruit flies, suggesting it might be serving an exceedingly advantageous regulatory role in survival.**

**The idea would be that in situations of food scarcity muscles can burn fat therefore a temporary muscle insulin resistance would preserve glucose to be used by the brain.**

Studies by Perry (2018) have shown that starvation increases white adipocyte lipolysis, which in turn leads to hepatic fat accumulation, increased hepatic DAG content, and PKC-epsilon activation. This in turn results in hepatic insulin resistence leading to decreased hepatic glycogen synthesis.

In order to test this potential role of this threonine phosphorilation in regulating insulin-receptor-kinase activity they mutated this threonine to glutamic acid to mimic threonine phosphorilation and found that this change abolishes insulin-receptor-kinase activity. Conversely when they mutated this threonine to an alanine to prevent any phosphorilation they found that the insulin receptor was protected from PKC-epsilon induced inhibition of its tyrosine-kinase activity. So taken together these study demonstrate a key role for Thr1160 phosphorilation in the regulation of insulin-receptor-kinase activity.

...


Based on Shulman's findings above I can't say what you should do, but here's my n=1 years ago: 

**one week of isocalorivc elimination diet to lower DAG-activated PKC enzymes.**

**No fructose.** Exactly because fructose enters the portal vein to feed the de novo lipogenesis pathway in the liver creating a major spike in liver DAG content. 

It's easy to stay a week without fruit and in any case a single mango may have 30 grams of fructose but a peach or a granny smith may have less than 7 grams. 

And as a sweetener instead of white sugar I adopted monohydrate dextrose, typically used in ice-cream recipes: it's similar to white sugar, even faster in raising blood glucose, but it's only glucose without any of the fructose that would end up activating epsilon. This also avoided using artificial sweeteners. Dextrose in itself doesn't trigger DNL unless in a reckless caloric surplus.

**No cheese.** Since saturated fats are a primary driver of DAG accumulation and PKC-epsilon activation it just sounded counterproductive to have them in a test diet.

**Less nightshades and more cruciferous vegetables, less wheat and more rice and pulses.**

This was because two ""opposite"" diets seem to have many fans who swear had benefits in few days or weeks: keto and WFPB. 

Since in a ketogenic diet you are basically flooding the liver with fatty acids almost no doctor would ever suggest it as a permanent diet, therefore at least a few of the people who had good results with keto must be among those who took advantage of another feature of ketogenic diets, the elimination of fructose and lectins. Many humans have clinically verifiable issues with solanine and gliadins, so for the test week I stayed away from nightshades and cereals.

As for WFPB diets it seemed to me apparent that if you cut white sugar because of the fructose content and also non-essential fats then by definition you can't accumulate ectopic liver fat or intramyocellular lipids so remission from insulin resistance would have to be automatic. Afterall WFPB is also the only dietetic intervention that can boast clinical evidence for regression of atherosclerotic plaques. But WFPB is a pretty strict diet that reminds me of eating grass so I couldn't follow it entirely and I welcomed fatty foods such as almonds and coconut, even dextrose sweetened hazelnut-cocoa spread.

As for pulses it was mostly to have more choices with starch, I didn't even know at the time that one of legumes' benefits is that they have several mechanisms that inhibit epsilon's membrane translocation.

In theory linoleic acid (LA) and Î±-lineolenic acid (ALA) are the only essential fats, those that humans can't synthesize, but since conversion of ALA into EPA and DHA is underwhelmingly around 1-4% also EPA and DHA are basically needed from diet. Which means fish, or for vegans it means fridge-stored algae omega-3 pills from a reputable brand if they don't cook seaweed.

**Less or no caffeine.** While coffee as a beverage may have benefits backed by studies still 2-3 coffees can make insuline sensitivity drop by 37% therefore removing caffeine for a week was a no-brainer.

1r69i7r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Leapmotor/comments/1r69i7r/leapmotor_c10_my_experience_after_9_months/,Leapmotor C10 - my experience after 9 months,"I have been thinking about writing this review for a while now, and the last few weeks finally pushed me to do it.

After starting a new job in Europe, part of the package included a company car. In May 2025 I was handed a brand new Leapmotor C10. I’m not much of a car enthusiast and just wanted something functional, so I wasn’t overly concerned despite the lack of real reviews online.

At first glance the car seemed fine. I actually quite like the styling, although I’m not a fan of the boxy front. Inside it’s comfortable: decent seats, nice trim and a large central screen. The rear seats are spacious enough for my two kids and the boot is smaller than I expected but still an OK size. During the handover I did notice an alarming number of menus, options and gimmicks, but I kept an open mind. I naively thought the basics must work if they spent this much time on the animations.

The car uses a key card, and optionally an app you bind to your phone. This is where the problems began. The app would not bind at all. We spent more than an hour in the dealership: confirmation email arrived, but login said “username or password incorrect”. Password reset said the email wasn’t linked to an account. Registering again said it already was. The staff had no solution and eventually just sent me away with no app. A very modern ownership experience: cutting-edge technology that doesn’t exist.

From that point on, frustration became the dominant theme.

Without the app, the key card is the only way to unlock the car. There is only one reader, located on the driver-side wing mirror. I genuinely don’t understand this decision. Keys have worked for decades. Keyless entry has worked for years. 10 years ago, I already had a car that unlocked automatically with the key in my pocket.

With this car, approaching with kids or shopping means you must always walk to the driver’s door first. If the driver’s side is beside traffic, you step onto the road, potentially with small kids in your arms. Even more stupid, if you need something from the boot, you will have to walk to the drivers door, collect it and then walk back around the car again to lock it. Without the app, this “modern” EV behaves like something from the 1980s. There is also no obvious off button. The car switches off only when locked, which makes the already complicated process even more awkward. Progress, apparently, involves doing more walking.

The driver assistance systems are extremely intrusive. Lane assist frequently fights the steering wheel, often incorrectly. Speed warnings regularly think you are in a 30 zone when you are actually in a 50. Emergency braking activates randomly and mostly while parking because it imagines obstacles. The first time it happened I got out to check whether I had actually hit something. A driver-facing camera issues fatigue warnings if I yawn or rub my eyes. It is good to know the car cares deeply about my well being while at the same time running my stress levels to max.

Most features can be disabled, but they reset every time the car restarts. On one long motorway journey I stopped for coffee, forgot to disable them again, and once back at speed the car began constant beeping while tugging the wheel left and right. I had to pull onto the hard shoulder just to make it stop. It is no joke to say the safety systems at times are the most dangerous part of the car.

The interior interface is equally frustrating. There are two screens, a main display and one behind the steering wheel. Warnings appear on both, depending on what it is. The steering wheel blocks part of the smaller secondary screen, so you hear a warning and then search around trying to find what the car is complaining about. It’s a bit like playing a game show while driving.

There are no physical buttons at all. Even climate control requires navigating overly complicated menus to find what you need. These menus then reset to the home screen after a few seconds, so unless you are quick you will have to start again. Temperature logic also makes no sense: heating at 18°C can roast you while air conditioning at 28°C can freeze you. Instead of a normal temperature scale you get a full separate scale for heating, cooling and ventilation. Inside each of thesem there is multiple airflow modes  (waves, mist, blasts) none particularly intuitive. I am still none the wiser on how to get my desired temperature, instead it is a lucky dip. I now spend more time negotiating with the air vents than the traffic. Exhausting.

The number of menus is also baffling. There are endless options for interior ambient light colours, brightness levels and animated light strips along the trim, multiple pages of customisation for mood lighting, yet basic usability still doesn’t work properly. It feels like development prioritised cosmetic gimmicks over fundamental functions. The car can display a rainbow across the dashboard in several different themes, but safely unlocking or adjusting temperature while driving remains a challenge. I can host a nightclub in the cabin, but not consistently enter it.

The seat automatically slides back when opening the door and forward again when seated. Nice idea, except if you close the door slightly too quickly it sometimes stays fully back, leaving you sitting miles from the wheel until you manually adjust it. It then takes another week to find the sweet spot of your seating position, only for the same thing to happen again.

Phone integration is another major issue. There is no proper Apple CarPlay or Android Auto. Instead the dealer provides a dongle that mirrors your phone onto the main display. First world problems, I know. But unbelievably frustrating. When you switch from the phone view to any native car menu, there is no way to return. The car effectively doesn't know that the phone exists. The only fix is unplugging and reconnecting the dongle. So in order to adjust a driving mode, or fuel usage, you lose the phone screen and the only way to get it back is to plug it out and back in, thereby restarting the cars screen.

Sometimes parts of the car’s interface overlay on the phone screen partially covering Waze or Google Maps. This is frustrating when using Waze as the arrival time is in the bottom of the screen, so in that case the only way to see your arrival time? Check your phone screen! Navigation by approximation. This is supposed to make life more convenient remember?

Audio controls are equally confusing. The steering wheel roller adjusts “media” volume by default, but calls, navigation and alerts all have separate levels accessed through an on screen menu. It took weeks to figure this out. The microphone also works intermittently with no clear cause.

Eventually, thanks to a Reddit user rather than the dealer, I got the app working. It allows remote unlock and preheating, but still requires opening the app and entering a code each time. Bluetooth proximity unlock exists but is unreliable, so I still end up using the card regularly. I would say 7 times out of 10, the phone or car is asleep and not connecting to each other, so I have to resort to the key card unlock, meaning the system designed to replace the card still depends on it.

After about nine months the key card itself began failing to read. Sometimes forcing everyone out of the car, locking it, waiting a minute, and unlocking again would fix it — embarrassing when you have passengers. Eventually it failed completely, leaving the car unable to start and forcing me to abandon it in another city and get my children home on public transport in freezing temperatures.

Following this, the garage did a software update which introduced a PIN-code start option so the car can theoretically be used without the card. You sit down and a keypad popup should appear on the screen and you enter the code to drive.

In practice, it’s unreliable. Sometimes the keypad appears instantly, sometimes not at all. Moving the gear selector can trigger it, but at times it can take 20 seconds of pushing the brake or moving the stalk.

Then, if you briefly leave the seat, as I do every morning to open the gate to my workplace, you must re-enter the code before moving again. So you end up stopped on a road, jumping out, getting back in and authenticating while traffic waits. It feels less like using a car and more like logging back into a computer after a timeout.

Overall the car feels rushed to market with little real-world testing. It is full of features intended to make driving easier, but many are unreliable or distracting, and some actively unsafe. The menus are clunky, the key system awkward, the phone workaround a complete and utter nightmare, and usability consistently poor.

It may be cheap and it may look fine, but after nine months I would not take this car again if it was for free. The sheer number of daily usability issues makes it hard to believe it was ever properly tested outside a showroom or on paper. Too many basic interactions like unlocking, starting, adjusting settings, even simply driving without interruption, require workarounds. Under all the styling and screens is not a finished product, but something that feels like it was released before real drivers ever had to live with it.",7,1771248205.0,Leapmotor,3,1.0,False

1r69hi5,https://www.reddit.com/r/solopassions/comments/1r69hi5/my_first_solo_backpacking_trip_taught_me_more/,My first solo backpacking trip taught me more than any guide book could: (Survived on street food and cheap hostels in Vietnam for a month) 🎒,"My first solo backpacking trip to Vietnam was supposed to be a carefully planned adventure, guided by all the blogs and guidebooks I'd devoured. Instead, it quickly became a month-long masterclass in *un-planning*, where the best lessons weren't found on a ""top 10 sights"" list, but in the chaos of a busy street market, or figuring out how to order food with zero shared language. Turns out, real travel wisdom comes from solving problems on the fly, not from memorizing facts.

I landed in Hanoi with a backpack, a loose idea of heading south, and a budget that demanded I become intimately familiar with street food and dorm rooms.

Here's the lowdown on how that month went:

*   **The Vibe:** Vietnam, for a solid month. I started in the bustling north (Hanoi, Halong Bay), meandered through the central charm (Hoi An, Hue), and finished up in the vibrant south (Ho Chi Minh City). No strict schedule, just a general direction.
*   **The Budget:** This was non-negotiable – cheap.
    *   **Accommodation:** Mostly 4-6 bed dorms in hostels. Expect to pay **$5-10 USD a night**. My best find was a place in Da Lat for $4 that included breakfast.
    *   **Food:** My daily fuel was overwhelmingly street food. Think pho, bun cha, banh mi, fresh spring rolls. I’d budget **$2-5 USD per meal**, often less. Coffee and fresh fruit smoothies were staples, usually under $1.50.
    *   **Transport:** Inter-city travel was mainly overnight sleeper buses (Hanoi to Hue, Hue to Hoi An, etc.), costing **$10-25 USD** depending on distance. Local transport was Grab bikes or walking. Total daily spend (excluding big tours) often hovered around **$20-30 USD**.
*   **The Logistics (DIY Style):** I booked my next hostel a day or two in advance using Booking.com or Hostelworld. Buses were booked through hostels or local travel agents (always haggle a little). A local SIM card bought at the airport was a lifesaver for navigation and Grab.

Now, it wasn't all picturesque lanterns and delicious noodles. There were plenty of moments where I felt utterly clueless. The first time I got a stomach bug, alone in a hostel dorm, I missed my bed more than anything. Navigating a conversation purely through hand gestures and Google Translate can be frustrating, and sometimes, the sheer intensity of a new city can be overwhelming. I got lost more times than I can count, and occasionally, a wave of loneliness would hit hard.

But those challenges were the real teachers. I learned to:

*   **Trust my gut:** That alleyway food stall with plastic stools looked dodgy, but the smells were incredible – it became my favourite bun cha spot. That quiet hostel felt right, even if it wasn't in the absolute 'center.'
*   **Embrace the unknown:** My best days were often when I ditched a plan and just wandered, stumbling upon a local festival or a hidden cafe.
*   **Communicate beyond words:** A smile, a nod, a pointed finger, and a genuine attempt at ""cảm ơn"" (thank you) went a long way.
*   **Be resourceful:** Lost my phone charger? There's a stall for that. Can't find an ATM? Ask a local. Necessity is a powerful motivator.

Guidebooks can give you the blueprint, but they can't teach you how to improvise when the roof caves in. They won't tell you the specific taste of a perfect banh mi from a street vendor who’s been doing it for 30 years, or the feeling of overcoming a communication barrier to share a laugh with a local. Those are the things you learn by showing up, being present, and sometimes, just figuring it out as you go.

1r69f35,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1r69f35/th_red_maple/,[TH] Red Maple,"Waiting for a train to pass on another line. A crimson leaf upon a railroad track, fallen from the trunk of a red maple. The leaf is swept off by the adjacent train’s gust. Can’t explain it, but I know it won’t return.  
The certainty lands before the explanation ever could.  
Such a long train. The Great Gatsby, sophomore-year summer reading. Wondering what erudite parents gave me that name. Didn’t they know better? My parents were far from literati acolytes. Dad knocked up Mom in high school. Some crass music was probably playing when he did it.  
Still in purgatory. Somewhere, a bitter ex-husband—Levi’s belt clutched—requests “Cocaine Blues” as a fuck-you to his ex-wife. Bet the song belted out when my parents conceived me. FM 97.2 played “A Boy Named Sue.” Despising the country music but can’t change stations. Genetic revenge.  
Train end in sight. Jay. Gats. Predetermined consequence of a summer reading assignment. Happy plus little plus accident equals “Milkman.” Wishing my parents had been versed enough to dodge my social funeral.  
Out of purgatory, toward a shadow purgatory. Work. Passing over the railroad tracks, the Ford F-150 in front advertises with a bumper sticker: DILF’n Ain’t Easy. Another. Thumb and ring fingers tucked in, other ones erect. Two in the pink, one in the stink? asking the truck.  
Stoplight change. Crank the steering wheel left onto Irote Ave. Almost miss my second turn, still processing the bumper stickers. Jerk the wheel right and park behind the squat municipal building that triples as police station, courthouse, and library—because in this town even the books are doing community service.  
Get out of the car and push through the entrance doors, inadvertently to the rhythm of “Cocaine Blues.” “Mornin’, Gat,” and “Morning, Detective.” Cops call me Gat. I’ll take it over Gatsby jokes. Hang up my winter jacket and settle into the office.  
Something feels off. I write it off, shaking my head. Scribble the F-150’s plate number and a quick association in my notebook—habit. In case the driver turns up dead. Or in case I need a laugh later. Also in case a pervert case surfaces. I do not explain the habit to myself. I never have. Someone raps on the door. Too fast. Too clean. Urgent.  
“Detective.”  
“Yes, Reynolds?”  
“A man came to see you. He says he has urgent business that you both need to attend to.”  
Both?  
“Who is this man?”  
“I don’t know. He says he knows you.”  
I sigh. Another nutcase. “Let him in.” What business could a man have that we both need to attend to? Thought registered. Reynolds holds open the door. A man pale as I am. An uncanny reflection.  
“Mornin’, Jay,” he voices, like a friend.  
“Morning, Mr—”  
“Mr. House. Mr. Robert House.”  
The name doesn’t fit the room. My prior intuition was right. Today’s a strange day. Robert House belongs somewhere else. A video game. An autocrat. A man who doesn’t age. A man who doesn’t leave his tower.  
Caught off guard, I forget his impudence. “Have a seat, Mr. House.” Mr. House drops into the chair.  
“Let us cut the crap and get to it,” he says, abrasively. “You establish connections easily. Are we right?”  
We? This man is operating under assumptions I don’t share.  
“Yes,” I say. “It’s part of my job.”  
“But it goes further.”  
“What do you mean?”  
“You were a straight-A student throughout your education, since middle school.”  
“Yes… yes, I was. How do you know that?”  
No reply.  
“In fact, we also know that you did not study throughout school and received these grades.”  
“How can you possibly know that?”  
My voice starts to tremble. No response again.  
“Who is we?”  
“We are a group interested in you, Jay.”  
Without permission, Mr. House takes out his phone and photographs the notebook. The F-150. The association.  
“What are you doing?”  
He looks at me, faintly irritated. “What is necessary,” he says, “to ensure world safety.”  
World safety?  
“What is necessary… for world safety?”  
House doesn’t respond.  
“May we grab a coffee?”  
“Uh, sure.”  
Mr. House leaves the room. He only refers to himself plurally. Is this plural a tic? Or a refusal to be singular. Sometime during the ten minutes he’s gone, three police officers run out the back door and into their patrol cars. Sirens blare.  
Mr. House returns, stirring his coffee oddly meticulously, though it appears to be black. “You’re going to want to come with us. There’s something important you need to see.”  
He’s already walking toward the municipal exit. I’m not riding with him. I take my own car.  
By the time I reach it, House pulls out ludicrously fast. If an officer were present, he’d be ticketed. I struggle to keep up. Just before the local sanatorium, I see an ambulance, a fire truck, three police cars—and the F-150 from this morning.  
Fire rises from the car’s carcass like blooming red maple leaves. Firemen douse the flames. After the smoke subsides, I peer inside to see what remains of a man in the front seat.  
Agape mouth. Cigarette-ash gray, entirely. Fragments of clothing cling lifelessly to him. A faint color—borderline illegible—of a Hooters shirt is seared into his chest. He has no pants. Singed off in the explosion. The bumper sticker reads: Ain’t Easy.  
A stray beam of sunlight strikes the corpse and refracts into my eyes. My vision pools with tears. I stand there, mutely crying, until one of the firemen asks if I’m all right.  
I can’t respond.  
I do not ask how this happened. I do not ask why.

1r69dqx,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBigGirlDiary/comments/1r69dqx/friday_share_weekly_healing_moments/,Friday Share: Weekly Healing Moments,"# About This Activity

Every Friday, we invite all Big Girls to share the warm, healing moments from the past week. These moments might be fleeting—a glance, a word, a hug—but they're the light we encountered in our daily lives.

This isn't just about checking off happy moments. It's an act of self-observation—What moments make us feel warm? Why do these instances touch us? The answers often reveal how we understand ourselves.

# When

Every Friday, continuing through the weekend

# How to Participate

**Share your healing moment using this structure:**

**1. The Moment (What + When + Where)**

What happened? (Specific scene, conversation, or details)

When? (Which day this week, what time)

Where? (Location or context)

Example:

Wednesday afternoon at the coffee shop. When I went to order, the barista remembered my preference before I even spoke: 'Oat milk latte again?'

**2. The Feeling (How)**

What did you feel in that moment?

Why did this moment touch you?

Example:

In that moment, I felt seen—not as a customer, but as a person. Being remembered felt warm, like I wasn't completely invisible in this city.

**3. Self-Reflection (Why)**

What did this moment make you realize?

What need or desire does it reflect deep within you?

What does 'healing' mean to you?

Example:

I realized how much being seen matters to me. Maybe it's because I've spent so long hiding myself and accommodating others, so when someone remembers my preference, it moves me deeply. This reminds me: I deserve to be seen. My needs matter.

**4. Image (Optional)**

If you can, share a photo related to this moment—the scene, an object, or any image that evokes that feeling. It doesn't need to be perfect, just authentic.

# Post Format

Structure: The Moment + The Feeling + Self-Reflection + Image

# Complete Example

**Title: 02/14/2026 Friday Healing Moment | A Remembered Preference**

\[The Moment\]

Wednesday afternoon, I went to my regular coffee shop. When I got to the counter, the barista saw me and, before I could speak, smiled and asked: 'Oat milk latte again?' I paused, then nodded. She continued: 'Less sugar, right?' In that moment, I almost cried.

\[The Feeling\]

I felt seen. Not as an order number, but as a person. In this busy city, someone remembered my preference, and that made me feel less invisible. The warmth didn't come from the coffee—it came from being remembered.

\[Self-Reflection\]

I realized how important being seen is to me. Maybe it's because I've spent so long hiding myself and accommodating others, so when someone proactively remembers what I need, it deeply moves me. This small moment reminded me: I deserve to be seen. My needs matter. Healing isn't about grand transformations—it's these tiny confirmations. Confirmation that I exist. Confirmation that I matter.

\[A photo of the coffee shop or the latte\]

# The Spirit

At r/TheBigGirlDiary, we believe:

Authenticity over perfection - No need to polish or beautify, just record honestly

Reflection creates meaning - Through reflection, we understand ourselves more deeply and treat ourselves more gently

Small things have power - Healing isn't always dramatic; it often hides in daily details

Sharing is healing - When we tell our stories, we heal not only ourselves but also give others resonance and strength

# Gentle Reminders

This isn't a competition—every healing moment is equally precious

Don't worry about not reflecting deeply enough—any authentic feeling deserves to be recorded

If you don't have a special healing moment some weeks, that's okay—no pressure, share when you feel moved

Please respond to others with kindness and respect—we're all on our own journeys

**Let's hold onto this week's warmth together this Friday.**

Not to remember how happy we were,

**but to remind ourselves—**

**even when life isn't perfect, there's still beauty worth seeing.**

Here's what it missed the actual science of WHY we overthink and a 5-minute system to break the loop.","You might remember this post from 2019: [https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/ctot74/advice\_why\_you\_must\_stop\_overthinking\_start/](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/ctot74/advice_why_you_must_stop_overthinking_start/)

It got 810 upvotes and 35 comments. The advice was solid motivational stuff  fail forward, adopt a growth mindset, use death as motivation, listen to GaryVee and Tony Robbins, ignore opinions.

People loved it. Comments like ""I'm saving this and printing it"" and ""woke up and feel motivated to tackle my goals.""

But here's the uncomfortable question: **did it actually change anyone's behavior long-term?**

I've spent the last 2 years studying behavioral neuroscience, and I think I know why advice like this feels great but rarely sticks. The post wasn't wrong — it was incomplete. It told us WHAT to think but not HOW to act.

**Here's what the neuroscience says the post was missing:**

**1. ""Just take action"" ignores your amygdala.**

Your brain has a threat-detection system that fires BEFORE your rational brain can intervene. When you face uncertainty (starting a business, having a hard conversation, going to the gym), your amygdala reads it as danger. That's why you ""know"" what to do but can't make yourself do it. It's not weakness. It's biology.

**2. Motivation is a feeling, not a strategy.**

The post said to listen to inspiring people until you take action. Research from the University of Pennsylvania shows that motivation is actually an OUTPUT of action, not an INPUT. You don't get motivated and then act. You act (even tiny actions) and then motivation follows. Waiting to ""feel ready"" is the trap.

**3. Overthinking isn't a mindset problem — it's a pattern problem.**

Your brain has literally wired neural pathways for overthinking through repetition. You can't ""decide"" to stop. You have to build competing pathways. That takes structured daily practice, not a one-time mindset shift.

**What actually works (all research-backed):**

→ **The 2-Minute Rule** (BJ Fogg, Stanford): Whatever you're avoiding, shrink it to 2 minutes. Don't ""write the report."" Just open the document and write one sentence. Your brain can't resist small actions. And starting is 80% of the battle.

→ **Implementation Intentions** (Peter Gollwitzer): Instead of ""I'll work out more,"" create: ""When I finish my morning coffee, I will put on my running shoes."" Studies show this format increases follow-through by 2-3x because it removes the decision point.

→ **Friction Design** (Shawn Achor, Harvard): Add friction to bad habits, remove friction from good ones. Want to stop doom-scrolling? Put your phone in another room and put a book on your pillow instead. Environment beats willpower every single time.

→ **Cognitive Defusion** (Acceptance & Commitment Therapy): When you catch yourself overthinking, say: ""I'm having the thought that I'll fail."" Not ""I'll fail."" This tiny reframe creates distance between you and the thought. It sounds dumb. It works.

→ **The 5-minute daily practice**: Pick ONE technique above. Practice it for 5 minutes every morning for 30 days. That's it. You're not building motivation. You're building a neural pathway. By day 30, your brain defaults to action instead of analysis.

**The original post ended with a George Bernard Shaw quote about the ""unreasonable man."" Here's my version:**

The reasonable overthinker reads motivational posts. The unreasonable one practices one technique for 5 minutes and closes Reddit.

I wrote a deeper breakdown of each technique with step-by-step instructions and the research behind them here: \[[https://mindsnack.app/blog/motivation-gives-you-24-hours-of-inspiration-action-systems-give-you-neural-pathway](https://mindsnack.app/blog/motivation-gives-you-24-hours-of-inspiration-action-systems-give-you-neural-pathways)s\]

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

1r69czo,https://www.reddit.com/r/rollercoasters/comments/1r69czo/fall_trip_report_for_europa_park_and_parc_asterix/,Fall Trip Report for [Europa Park] and [Parc Asterix],"Europa Park (1st visit: 10/21 & 10/22/2025)

It is an absolutely beautiful park. If I hadn't visited Phantasialand right before this, I would call this the most themed park I've been to (other than WDW). This trip was during the fall, so there were truckloads of pumpkins everywhere. (Seriously, what is their pumpkin budget?)

If you're not familiar, Europa Park is largest theme park in Europe by land area and falls in between Disney and Six Flags in terms of rides and attractions. While it does have 4 extreme coasters, most of their coasters fall into the more tame thrill or family category.  

Since Europa Park is run by the Mack family, a lot of their rides features animatronics and other theming in the queues and pre-ride dark section. So it's almost as if Mack is trying to show off what the company can do (In a good way). 

Getting there and where I stayed.
I came via train from Cologne to the station in Ringsheim. And then took the bus from Ringsheim to Rust (it looks like the bus may wait for the train to arrive). The bus is cash only. I stayed in Rust, which was a bit more expensive price-wise, but I wanted to be able to walk to/from the park. It looks like most of the hotels there are mostly local (not many chains), which I always find to be an interesting experience. The only downside is that A/C is not a standard feature, and the rooms can feel a bit warm at night even in October after leaving the windows open all day. I stayed three nights. If I were to do it again, I probably wouldn't stay in Rust the final night, since there's not a lot to do after the park closes. 

My ranking of EP’s coasters:

Blue Fire Megacoaster (5) - My favorite coaster in the park. I did get one back row ride. The mid course brakes can be a bit jarring (even if they don't slow down the train). On one ride, the brakes caused my head to hit the back of the seat, and I actually saw stars. Other than that, I would call this my favorite ride at the park. 

Silver Star (3) - front & back row rides - this is my first true “airtime machine” hyper. Interesting queue that meanders around their racing museum. I was actually somewhat terrified on my first ride since the restraint felt loose and has gaps on the left and right sides. I really enjoyed this ride. Some of the best floater that I have ever experienced. 

Voltron (3) - front & back row - grayed out. Very fun with lots of interesting elements not found on many other coasters (automatic restraints, vertical launch, backwards launch, mid course turntable). Some great pre-ride theming. It did leave me with a mild headache after each ride, which is why it doesn't rank higher for me. I honestly really enjoyed watching this ride from the outside. When I got to Rust the day before, I walked around the edge of the park just to see which coasters I could see, and you can see several elements of Voltron from outside the park. After hours, I did get to see EP stop the Voltron trains at the booster launches, which also function as block brakes. In other words, they intentionally valleyed the ride and had it self rescue. 

Wodan (3) - here I am stuck in the middle with you (only middle train rides). Enjoyable layout, but a little rough and left me with a mild headache after each ride. I was a bit surprised how highly ranked this ride is given it's roughness. 

Eurostar Cancan Coaster (1) - I really enjoyed it. Indoor ride in the dark. It has some really nice forces. It's the ride I most wish I got a second ride on

Euro-Mir (2) - forwards & backwards - great soundtrack. Spins in the first half and then locks into place for the second half. I really enjoyed it. Interesting spiral lift hill. Unique first half and forceful second half. Very sad they're tearing it down (tear down Schweizer Bobbahn instead). 

Pegasus (1) - I really enjoyed this ride. Some nice forces and height. Kind of hidden inside of Poseidon. 

Matterhorn Blitz (1) - nice line theming. Ride had a few interesting themed elements, but is otherwise your typical wild mouse. 

Arthur (1) - interesting mix of a family coaster and a dark ride. Fairly random song choice in the middle. 

Schweizer Bobbahn (1) - rough, very shaky on the track. Worst bobsled I've ever ridden. Can you retract a bobsled?

Poseidon (1) - Not as rough as expecting, for mildly wet. 

Atlantis super splash (1) - back row, didn't get wet. Not sure if the ride is worth it given how much land it takes up. Maybe it would have been better on a hot day. 

Alpenexpress Enzian (1) - I haven't done too many powered coasters, so this was interesting. 

Ba-Ba-Express (1) - kid coaster 

Non coasters

Pirates of Batavia - The most Disney-like ride in the park. It's been a long time since I've done one of these types of attractions. 

Dancing Dingie - no line - My first time trying one of these. Some nice close call elements using a small space. Might be my favorite smaller flat ride 

Whale Adventures - interesting, but more geared towards kids

Globe Theater - The show is mostly in German & French with occasional English. My first time seeing a mixed language show. The actors make great use body language that makes the show still enjoyable even if you don't know German or French. 

---------------------------

Parc Asterix (Date: 10/27/25)

I'd hoped going on a Monday in October that the park wouldn't be too crowded, but alas, it was very crowded. They are also sold out of skip the line passes by the time I got to the park. A 2 single ride options opened up later in the day for some of the less popular rides. Without those, I wouldn't have been able to ride everything. If you're planning to go on a popular day, consider buying skip the lines passes very early. M

Only one ride on each (except for Pegasus), in chronological order:

Goudurix - front row - weird over the shoulder restraints (40 min wait)

Oziris - About eight people line jumping. Not much theming until you get closer to the ride station. Very fun B&M with an element that goes under the water. 60 min wait

Toutatis - front row, left with an empty seat next to me. Incredible multi-launch track shift. Great upside-down hang time. Honestly, this ride entirely changed my day. Prior to this, I was feeling pretty low energy by lack of sleep and discouraged by the long lines, ride closures, line jumping, & difficulty finding coffee. I honestly debated leaving the park. But after this ride, I really felt my mood shift to excited and energized. 

SOS Tournevis - medium length family coaster. Slid around a lot between the seats

La Trace du Hourra - faster than other bobsleds and smoother than Europa Park’s bobsled

Tonnerre 2 Zeus - 1st row, left - great airtime, in sideways element, nice tunnels. I was watching a POV video afterwards, and I think this ride is quite underrated. If they can fix the roughness issues, this could be a really fantastic coaster. 

Pégase Express - front row- got stuck in the Medusa room for 20-30 mins. She did her whole show, and then no launch backwards. After a few minutes, the ride operators made an announcement (in French) that the ride would experience a maintenance issue and the whole train laughed. I eventually use Google Translate to talk with the guy next to me. Ops did give us an extra ride. 

Le Vol d’lcare - front seat, faster and longer than expected. Closed earlier in the day. 

Cétautomatix - longest queue times of the day

This truck would define my day.,"Waiting for a train to pass on another line. A crimson leaf upon a railroad track, fallen from the trunk of a red maple. The leaf is swept off by the adjacent train’s gust. Can’t explain it, but I know it won’t return.  
The certainty lands before the explanation ever could.  
Such a long train. The Great Gatsby, sophomore-year summer reading. Wondering what erudite parents gave me that name. Didn’t they know better? My parents were far from literati acolytes. Dad knocked up Mom in high school. Some crass music was probably playing when he did it.  
Still in purgatory. Somewhere, a bitter ex-husband—Levi’s belt clutched—requests “Cocaine Blues” as a fuck-you to his ex-wife. Bet the song belted out when my parents conceived me. FM 97.2 played “A Boy Named Sue.” Despising the country music but can’t change stations. Genetic revenge.  
Train end in sight. Jay. Gats. Predetermined consequence of a summer reading assignment. Happy plus little plus accident equals “Milkman.” Wishing my parents had been versed enough to dodge my social funeral.  
Out of purgatory, toward a shadow purgatory. Work. Passing over the railroad tracks, the Ford F-150 in front advertises with a bumper sticker: DILF’n Ain’t Easy. Another. Thumb and ring fingers tucked in, other ones erect. Two in the pink, one in the stink? asking the truck.  
Stoplight change. Crank the steering wheel left onto Irote Ave. Almost miss my second turn, still processing the bumper stickers. Jerk the wheel right and park behind the squat municipal building that triples as police station, courthouse, and library—because in this town even the books are doing community service.  
Get out of the car and push through the entrance doors, inadvertently to the rhythm of “Cocaine Blues.” “Mornin’, Gat,” and “Morning, Detective.” Cops call me Gat. I’ll take it over Gatsby jokes. Hang up my winter jacket and settle into the office.  
Something feels off. I write it off, shaking my head. Scribble the F-150’s plate number and a quick association in my notebook—habit. In case the driver turns up dead. Or in case I need a laugh later. Also in case a pervert case surfaces. I do not explain the habit to myself. I never have. Someone raps on the door. Too fast. Too clean. Urgent.  
“Detective.”  
“Yes, Reynolds?”  
“A man came to see you. He says he has urgent business that you both need to attend to.”  
Both?  
“Who is this man?”  
“I don’t know. He says he knows you.”  
I sigh. Another nutcase. “Let him in.” What business could a man have that we both need to attend to? Thought registered. Reynolds holds open the door. A man pale as I am. An uncanny reflection.  
“Mornin’, Jay,” he voices, like a friend.  
“Morning, Mr—”  
“Mr. House. Mr. Robert House.”  
The name doesn’t fit the room. My prior intuition was right. Today’s a strange day. Robert House belongs somewhere else. A video game. An autocrat. A man who doesn’t age. A man who doesn’t leave his tower.  
Caught off guard, I forget his impudence. “Have a seat, Mr. House.” Mr. House drops into the chair.  
“Let us cut the crap and get to it,” he says, abrasively. “You establish connections easily. Are we right?”  
We? This man is operating under assumptions I don’t share.  
“Yes,” I say. “It’s part of my job.”  
“But it goes further.”  
“What do you mean?”  
“You were a straight-A student throughout your education, since middle school.”  
“Yes… yes, I was. How do you know that?”  
No reply.  
“In fact, we also know that you did not study throughout school and received these grades.”  
“How can you possibly know that?”  
My voice starts to tremble. No response again.  
“Who is we?”  
“We are a group interested in you, Jay.”  
Without permission, Mr. House takes out his phone and photographs the notebook. The F-150. The association.  
“What are you doing?”  
He looks at me, faintly irritated. “What is necessary,” he says, “to ensure world safety.”  
World safety?  
“What is necessary… for world safety?”  
House doesn’t respond.  
“May we grab a coffee?”  
“Uh, sure.”  
Mr. House leaves the room. He only refers to himself plurally. Is this plural a tic? Or a refusal to be singular. Sometime during the ten minutes he’s gone, three police officers run out the back door and into their patrol cars. Sirens blare.  
Mr. House returns, stirring his coffee oddly meticulously, though it appears to be black. “You’re going to want to come with us. There’s something important you need to see.”  
He’s already walking toward the municipal exit. I’m not riding with him. I take my own car.  
By the time I reach it, House pulls out ludicrously fast. If an officer were present, he’d be ticketed. I struggle to keep up. Just before the local sanatorium, I see an ambulance, a fire truck, three police cars—and the F-150 from this morning.  
Fire rises from the car’s carcass like blooming red maple leaves. Firemen douse the flames. After the smoke subsides, I peer inside to see what remains of a man in the front seat.  
Agape mouth. Cigarette-ash gray, entirely. Fragments of clothing cling lifelessly to him. A faint color—borderline illegible—of a Hooters shirt is seared into his chest. He has no pants. Singed off in the explosion. The bumper sticker reads: Ain’t Easy.  
A stray beam of sunlight strikes the corpse and refracts into my eyes. My vision pools with tears. I stand there, mutely crying, until one of the firemen asks if I’m all right.  
I can’t respond.  
I do not ask how this happened. I do not ask why.

1r69ams,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracyfact/comments/1r69ams/are_you_seeking_where_is_purpose_of_life/,are you seeking where is purpose of life ?,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Your dream of a barndominium can come to life with the right farmhouse style décor. This charming approach combines rustic elements with modern comfort. Let's explore creative ideas that will help you incorporate farmhouse style in your space effortlessly.

To start, consider using natural materials in your décor. Wooden beams are a hallmark of the farmhouse aesthetic, so if you're designing your barndominium from scratch or renovating an existing structure, think about exposing those beams. You can leave them in their raw form for a rustic look or polish them for a more refined appearance. Pair wooden beams with shiplap walls to instantly evoke that cozy farmhouse feel.

Next, textiles play a significant role in achieving that warm atmosphere. You can use soft, muted colors and patterns that reflect nature. Look for:

- Cotton or linen throw pillows with plaid or floral patterns
- Woven rugs that add texture underfoot
- Heavy, textured curtains in earthy tones for your windows

The mixture of textiles can layer your space beautifully, adding depth while enhancing comfort. Each piece adds character and tells a story.

Antiques or vintage finds can further enrich your design. Visit local flea markets or thrift stores to unearth unique items that fit your vision. Some great ideas include:

- Old farm tools repurposed as wall art
- Vintage lanterns or glass jars for lighting
- Rusty metal signs or weathered wooden crates for storage and decoration

These elements not only provide visual interest but also connect your space to a history that resonates with farmhouse style.

Furniture selection is crucial in achieving a farmhouse ambiance. Opt for pieces that are both comfortable and functional. Think about large farmhouse tables made of reclaimed wood that can serve as a gathering spot for family and friends. Mix in seating options like upholstered chairs or benches with distressed finishes. A cozy nook with a well-placed armchair and side table can create a perfect reading corner.

Lighting can elevate your barndominium's style as well. Farmhouse lighting fixtures often feature a mix of metal and glass to create a rustic yet modern look. Consider:

- Large pendant lights above your dining table
- Charming chandeliers in entryways or living rooms
- Stylish wall sconces that radiate warmth

Natural light is also essential in creating a welcoming atmosphere. Keep windows unobstructed or use light, airy curtains to allow sunlight to stream through, enhancing the cozy yet bright feel of your home.

The color palette in your barndominium is another fantastic way to capture farmhouse style. Neutral tones—like whites, creams, grays, and soft pastels—create a soothing backdrop. Spice it up with accent colors found in nature, such as sage green or sky blue. Use these tones in your furniture, walls, and accessories for a cohesive look.

Don’t forget the outdoors! A farmhouse style barndominium isn't complete without paying attention to the exterior space. Create a welcoming entryway with a covered porch, adorned with rocking chairs and potted plants. Garden elements like raised vegetable beds or flower boxes can introduce a charming, natural flair that echoes the farmhouse tradition of homesteading.

Artwork can serve as an excellent focal point in your design. Look for pieces that reflect rural life or landscapes—think framed prints of farm animals, barns, or fields. Hang these in clusters to create visual interest on your walls. This personal touch connects you more deeply with the theme of farmhouse living.

Always remember that comfort and functionality are key in achieving the farmhouse style. Your barndominium should feel like home, where family and friends gather and reminisce. Choose décor that encourages warmth and joy, ensuring it reflects your personality and preferences while embracing the essence of farmhouse style.

Tips for Achieving a Cozy and Functional Barndominium Living Space
------------------------------------------------------------------

Transforming your barndominium into a cozy and functional living space is easier than you might think. With the right design strategies and decor choices, you can create an atmosphere that is warm and welcoming while also practical for everyday living. Here are some tips to guide you through this process.

### Embrace Open Spaces

One of the most appealing aspects of a barndominium is its open floor plan. You should make the most of this by keeping furniture arrangements simple and accessible. Consider these points:

- **Define Zones:** Use area rugs to separate spaces, like the living area from the dining space.
- **Open Shelving:** Incorporate open shelving in the kitchen to display dishware and add character without crowding the area.
- **Multi-use Furniture:** Opt for furniture pieces that serve more than one purpose, such as a coffee table with storage or a sofa bed for guests.

### Utilize Natural Light

Natural light is a boon in any living space. It adds warmth and creates an airy feel. Here’s how to maximize it in your barndominium:

- **Large Windows:** Install large windows or glass doors to invite light in. The views can be stunning and bring the outdoors inside.
- **Light Colors:** Choose light-colored curtains which let in light but still offer privacy.
- **Mirrors:** Use mirrors strategically to reflect light and make the space feel larger.

### Incorporate Cozy Textiles

Textiles play a vital role in making a home feel warm and inviting. Here are some suggestions:

- **Layered Textiles:** Combine different fabrics such as wool, cotton, and linen for an inviting atmosphere.
- **Throws and Pillows:** Add throws and decorative pillows to your sofa and beds for comfort and style.
- **Rug Selection:** Choose area rugs that are soft underfoot to create a cozy vibe in living areas.

### Choose a Neutral Color Palette

Color can significantly affect the mood of a space. A neutral color palette works well in a barndominium for a cozy feel. Here’s how to implement it:

- **Warm Neutrals:** Use colors like tan, beige, or soft grays as your base.
- **Accent Walls:** Consider painting one wall a darker shade to add depth without overwhelming the space.
- **Accessorize:** Use colorful artwork or decor pieces to inject personality without taking over the neutral base.

### Incorporate Rustic Elements

Rustic decor aligns perfectly with the barndominium style. Here are some ideas:

- **Wood Features:** Think reclaimed wood beams, shiplap walls, or barn doors for an authentic feel.
- **Natural Materials:** Use stone or brick for fireplaces and wall accents to enhance the rustic charm.
- **Farmhouse Decor:** Add vintage farmhouse-inspired pieces like metal signs, lanterns, or antique furniture.

### Maximize Storage Solutions

A functional living space requires good organization. Consider these storage ideas:

- **Built-in Cabinets:** Custom-built cabinetry can fit seamlessly into the design while providing ample storage.
- **Functional Entryways:** Utilize mudroom designs with hooks, benches, and baskets to keep shoes and coats organized.
- **Under-bed Storage:** Use labeled bins or drawers under beds to store seasonal items or extra blankets.

### Create a Welcoming Outdoor Space

Don’t forget the outside! A cozy barndominium includes great outdoor areas. Enhance your porch or patio with the following:

- **Comfortable Seating:** Invest in outdoor furniture with cushions for comfortable lounging.
- **Fire Pits:** A fire pit adds warmth and serves as a gathering spot for family and friends.
- **Landscaping:** Use native plants and flowers to create a low-maintenance, beautiful landscape.

With these tips, you can turn your barndominium into a space that is both cozy and functional, a true reflection of your lifestyle, and a sanctuary for relaxation. Enjoy the process of making it your own!

### Conclusion

Embracing the charm of farmhouse style in your barndominium can transform your living space into a warm and inviting haven. By incorporating creative décor ideas, you can celebrate rustic aesthetics while infusing modern comforts. Consider using reclaimed wood for accents or creating a cozy nook with oversized furniture and plush textiles. These elements not only add character but also create a welcoming atmosphere, perfect for family gatherings and quiet evenings at home.

To achieve a cozy and functional living space, think about the layout and flow of your barndominium. Open-concept designs allow for social interaction, while designated areas for work, play, and relaxation can help maintain balance. Utilize multifunctional furniture that enhances both style and practicality, ensuring that every square foot serves a purpose. Natural lighting and earthy tones can further enhance this cozy vibe, making your home feel spacious and serene.

Remember, your barndominium is a reflection of your personal style and lifestyle. Incorporate elements that resonate with you, whether it's vintage finds, handmade crafts, or vibrant artwork. The key is to create a harmonious blend of functionality and aesthetics. Take the time to experiment and adapt your space to suit your needs.

With these creative ideas and tips, you’re well on your way to crafting a farmhouse style barndominium that’s not only visually stunning but also uniquely you. Enjoy the journey of decorating your home, turning it into a perfect retreat that combines the simplicity of farmhouse decor with the practicality of barndominium living.",1,1771247510.0,BarndosAndCabins,0,1.0,False

It was one thing after another . 

Aino is much more busy than I would have expected. 

Received Orders from Ebbinn for water treatment plant , vehicle manufacturing, along with needing a specialty fasteners to attach cutters to the saw mill roof . Also a list of items for water collection to be used in garden areas . 

The water collection sounds like Liz . No chemicals in our food she says . We will live longer less of a health issue . 

I was told the staging had gone well . 

Aino checked in several times  . 

I told him don’t worry I have this . And if I did not have an answer . I would politely informed the person . You will get back to them in a day or two at the most  . 

I sent out a message to the bakers today . Asking them to all get together. I want a meeting to address the exporting of sweets to the capital “ credits will flow there first “ most likely.

Chequers —1 medium “1930 delivery “ 

pizza extra cheese and mushrooms with ham - send

Seems our Chain saw supplier is interested in chickens and eggs . This sounds like a Marcus deal to me 

Marcus keeps talking about apple sauce and Jam . Shipping more apples out . 

Liz has been asleep on my bed for two hours now . She said my spare bed is hard . 

I could hear her stirring a little bit ago . 

More likely because Liz has never lived alone from my talks with mom .

Aino just left I told him I had pizza coming  he could stay . But oh no forbid relaxing for a hour . 

I will both pity and will be happy for whoever the woman he gets married to . 

He is like my dad a workaholic. 

He was heading to his office and needed to get some  work done 

I just ordered another pizza ASAP and coffee to be delivered to his office . 

Well Liz is up I’m going to make some calming tea “ that is what the label has on the jar” to have with pizza as should be here any minute . 

Ping - thanks for the pizza “ why did you lower my chair” 🙂

Everyday I always wonder what the composters Clara and Cynthia are up to 

. 

Cynthia and Clara treated me like I was family . 

And Liz here looking 👀 over my shoulder she is my little sister . And I’m never leaving .

I’m a 38-year-old living in the Netherlands for several years now. To immediately break the Dutch stereotype: I’m 1.74m. So yes, I’m below average height here — but above average in conversation (I like to think).

Life is in a good place: career solid, married and happy, hobbies under control. But I’ve realized that building real, lasting friendships as an adult takes intention. So here I am, making the first move.

I’m looking for a genuine, down-to-earth friendship — the kind where conversations actually go somewhere.

# What I’m into:

**Travel & Culture**  
I love discovering new places — cities, food, history, different ways of living. I’ve been to quite a few countries, and the list is still long. I enjoy both planning a trip properly and randomly finding a great local spot.

**Politics & Real Conversations**  
I enjoy talking about politics, society, and how the world is evolving. Not in a preachy way — just thoughtful, open discussions. I appreciate people who can disagree intelligently and still laugh together after.

**Festivals & Social Life**  
I enjoy good festivals, music, energy, being around people. I’m not 20 anymore, but I still appreciate a good vibe, good company, and a bit of chaos once in a while.

**Books & Movies**  
Yes, I enjoy sci-fi and fantasy — but I’m not living in another galaxy. I just appreciate good storytelling, whether that’s a political drama, a documentary, or something with dragons. Balance is key.

**Unexpected hobby**  
I make serious ice cream. Not “home experiment” level — more like slightly obsessive, technical, texture-and-balance kind of ice cream. If we become friends, you’ll probably end up as a taste tester.

# The important part:

I’m married and very happy. This is strictly about friendship.

I’m bi. I don’t care about your orientation — I care about authenticity. Be direct. Be honest. Don’t disappear after a week. Let’s build something consistent.

I’m looking for that solid friendship where we can:

* Talk about politics one day
* Go to a festival the next
* Travel somewhere new
* Or just grab a coffee and talk about life

If this sounds like your kind of vibe, send me a message.  
Tell me:

* The best trip you’ve ever taken
* Or the last topic that made you think

Someone says something to me, I don't hear them or don't realize they're addressing me specifically, I don't respond, and they get offended. Yesterday my coworker walked past my desk and said something, I had my headphones on working, and apparently she was asking if I wanted coffee. She came back later and made a comment about me being too busy for everyone lately. I tried to explain I literally didn't hear her but she seemed to think I was making excuses. Same thing happened at the gym when someone asked if I was done with a machine. I didn't respond because I thought they were talking to their friend, and the guy huffed and said never mind in an annoyed voice. I have hearing loss and wear hearing aids but they don't alert me when someone is trying to get my attention from behind or from the side. People think I'm being intentionally dismissive or stuck up.

1r694h2,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Vlad_vvv/comments/1r694h2/ive_been_playing_a_game_with_a_stranger_through_a/,"I’ve been playing a ""game"" with a stranger through a train window for three years. Today, it ended.","I’m sitting on my couch with a cup of tea, and I feel strangely heavy. Not ""bad"" heavy, just... like a chapter of a book I really liked finally closed.

I’m a commuter. For the last three years, I’ve taken the 7:45 AM train from my suburb into the city for work. It’s a 40-minute ride. About ten minutes into the trip, the train passes a row of backyards that sit right against the tracks.

In one of those yards, there’s a house with a big, bright yellow porch. And every single morning, rain or shine, there was an old man sitting there in a rocking chair with a Golden Retriever at his feet.

It started totally by accident. About a month into my commute, I was staring out the window, bored, and we made eye contact. I gave a tiny, awkward wave. To my surprise, he shot upright and waved back with both hands, like he’d been waiting for me specifically.

Since then, it became ""our thing.""

I started sitting in the same carriage, fourth window from the back, every day. As the train approached the yellow porch, I’d put down my phone or book. I’d press my hand against the glass or give a thumbs-up. He’d be there, sometimes wearing a huge neon beanie in the winter, sometimes holding up a mug of coffee like he was toasting to my promotion (even though he didn't know me).

Once, when it was pouring rain, I held up a piece of paper that said ""STAY DRY!"" in big sharpie letters. He laughed so hard I could see his shoulders shaking even as the train sped past at 60 mph.

He was my ""7:55 AM friend."" I didn't know his name. He didn't know mine. We never spoke a single word. But on mornings when my boss was being a nightmare or I was feeling lonely in a big city, seeing that yellow porch and that enthusiastic wave made me feel like everything was going to be okay. It was a 3-second burst of pure, uncomplicated kindness.

A few months ago, the dog wasn't there anymore. I felt a genuine pang of grief. The next day, I held up a small drawing of a dog with a heart. He saw it, put his hand over his chest, and bowed his head. We shared that moment of loss through a double-paned glass window at high speed.

Well, this morning, the train slowed down near his house because of some track maintenance.

As we approached the yellow porch, I saw a ""For Sale"" sign in the yard. The rocking chair was gone. The porch was empty.

But then, I saw a younger woman—maybe his daughter—standing by the fence. She was looking at the train, clearly waiting. When she saw me in my usual window, her face lit up. She held up a large piece of cardboard.

It said: ""HE MOVED TO THE COAST. HE SAYS: THANK YOU FOR THE WAVES.""

I burst into tears right there in the middle of a crowded quiet carriage. I felt like a total idiot, wiping my eyes while a businessman in a suit stared at me, but I didn't care.

I don't think people realize how much space ""strangers"" can take up in our hearts. I’ll never see him again. I’ll never know if he liked jazz or if he was a grumpy old man to everyone else. To me, he was just the person who told me ""Good morning"" without saying a word for three years.

The train didn't stop. It kept going. But the city feels a little bit smaller today, in a good way.

Safe travels, wherever you are, my 7:55 AM friend. I hope the coast is beautiful.",0,1771247161.0,u_Vlad_vvv,0,0.5,False

I’ve got to be honest… there are so many times I just want to go out and do something, hang out, grab a coffee, or just spend some time with people—but I end up alone because no one’s around or available. It can get kind of frustrating, you know?

That’s when the idea came to me: what if there was a simple way to share what you want to do and find people who want to join? That’s how **GoingToo** was born, a platform where I (and anyone else) can post an activity we want to do, big or small, and connect with people who are interested. Whether it’s a casual coffee, a short walk, or just a simple hangout, it makes it easy to actually make it happen.

The platform is live now, and you can check it out here:  
[https://goingtoo.site](https://goingtoo.site/)

Honestly, I’d really love to hear what you think, any suggestions, feedback, or ideas. Your input could help me make it even better, and who knows, you might find some fun ways to meet new people along the way! ❤️

I thought it was overhyped at first, but it’s actually a pretty decent trend haha.

The Daily Bakes: 11/10

\- Marshmallow outer layer isn’t too thick, which I like

\- Pistachio filling isn’t nakakaumay, there’s a hint of saltiness. They nailed their filling considering they mainly focus on Dubai chocolate bars and cakes

\- Filling is really packed and not dry even if refrigerated

\- 950 for 4 pcs, priceyy but can be somewhat justified by the overall quality, generous portions, and PACKAGING

Coffee Daily by FT: 10/10

\- 449 for 4 pcs, decently priced

\- Good marshmallow to filling ratio

\- Somewhat tasted similar to Daily Bakes but approximately half the size (\~45g)

\- Not as filled/packed as Daily Bakes, but filling is good and not too sweet

The Kind Cookie: 8/10

\- 420 for 4 pcs

\- Big (\~80g), almost as big as Daily Bakes

\- Found the filling a bit too sweet, but still good

\- Marshmallow layer a bit thicker

\- Filling is really packed and not dry even if refrigerated

C’est Bon: 7/10

\- 1549 for 16 pcs

\- Good outer to filling ratio

\- Filling was a bit sweeter than the others, got umay after 1 piece considering it’s not that big per piece

\- I just didn’t like how the kataifi bits were too shredded/short. Maybe it was for added texture/crunch, but it felt like crunching on sugar haha. Still good tho

The Ximen: 7/10

\- 170 per piece

\- Good inner to outer ratio

\- Filling is good but a bit dry

By Miguelas: 6/10

\- 360 for 4, decently priced considering the bigger size

\- Marshmallow layer was super thick :(

\- Filling was good and not too sweet, but it was too dry (too much kataifi compared to the pistachio mixture)

Slide Coffee: 5/10

\- Found it underwhelming for its price (470 for 3 pcs medium, ordered through Grab)

\- Their filling is a bit dry and tasted the most different compared to the others I’ve tried (it was a really vibrant green which stood out vs the rest, idk if that explains it). Tasted more artificial

\- Filling to marshmallow layer ratio is good

Sweet tones: to follow

I'm semi- doing intuitive eating (thats my intention anyway) and haven't figured out the ""gentle nutrition"" part. I feel like crap when I eat crap, but the motivation isn't there because I'm so scattebrained, I never have the groceries for a whole meal because again, I didn't plan and prep. Because I'm disorganized. Because I have ADHD.  So I guess my question is, those of you with no appetite, how do you remember to eat and how do you all plan your meals without being a complete disaster? Thanks!

I turned 20 in january, been yearning to go to school for YEARS, but had to hold back to be my father's sole caretaker. Only child, and everyone else in the family doesn't help. 

I don't know what to do. I'm also disabled. I spend half the time on his 'bad days' taking care of him, helping him up stairs, making him coffees, making him food, cleaning the house, making sure he's sleeping in a comfortable position. His good days are good, walking around, getting things done, but the bad days are so incredibly stressful and difficult to watch that they give me a LOT of bad stress. I feel like I'm dying.

My partner is long distance and left yesterday to head back home. I don't know how to handle this alone anymore. I tell my father i feel too sick, too stressed to care for him, and he disregards me. He tells me I get in my own head, I'm in perfect health, etc. And he will get upset or angry if my help is not adequate. I have no money, 3 cats, no way to get out and start my own life. I pay the bills, for god's sake. I sincerely am dreading having to do this loop for the rest of my life. I don't want to spend my life caretaking.

Also when I do end up being around people I know or just people in general, like when I go to my favourite coffee shop where I know alla the staff quite well, I end up talking to them a fair bit, and I enjoy doing so a lot. I love talking to people. 

This social style can cause issues with online relationships I have (friends) because I can go insane periods of time before having any ability to reply to them because I am in a state where I am currently too content with being alone.

I also only hang out with ppl ik irl fairly infrequently too because of this. And the one person I do hang out with said I could meet her friends, and while I kinda wanna I havent pursued it because I don't want even more people I need to socialize with considering how much of my time I prefer being alone.",4,1771246175.0,introvert,10,0.7,False

To sum it up;

I worked in a Coffee Shop for two weeks. The owner was very odd and a slight bit creepy but I gave him benefit of doubt. The place was a shambles, broken tiles, rubbish bags scattering the yard and grease caked ovens and stove tops. Very bad.

I worked 31 hours from January 26th to February 1st and then 26 hours from February 2nd to February 8th. I left on February 8th to join a better opportunity.

The owner promised to pay me on February 9th but proceeded to push back and say his account was at fault and he has to wait for her to send a payslip. Now, I did bombard him with texts but I have my rent and bills to pay. He read my texts and ignored them until I mentioned involving the WRC.

He sent me a payslip on Thursday 12th and a “proof” of payment, which I’m still unsure if it’s real or not.

It was sent from AIB to my bank, PTSB. I know PTSB are horrendously bad for late payments but it is now Monday and I still have no payment from him.

He also owes me the 26 hours from February 2nd to February 8th, I am yet to receive a payslip or response from him about this.

I have threatened the WRC multiple times but to no response from him.

Do you think the WRC is the port of call or what should I do? I am getting desperate at this point as I haven’t been paid in 3 weeks and all my bill payments and rent and coming up and I would not like to go into arrears.

I’d really love to get your advice on how to organize my itinerary in Edinburgh and how to group the places I’d like to visit in a logical way.

For context, my boyfriend and I will be in Edinburgh for 2.5 days (3 nights) at the end of October (so the days will be shorter). We’ll be staying at a hotel on Queen Street and will be getting around on foot + public transport if needed.

Here’s what we’d like to visit:

\- Dean Village

\- Leith (The Shore, Royal Yacht Britannia)

\- Stockbridge

\- Old Town (Circus Lane, Vennel Viewpoint, Royal Mile, Maker’s Market, St Giles’ Cathedral, Victoria Street, Cockburn Street)

\- Edinburgh Castle or Holyrood Palace (which one is better?)

\- Princes Street Gardens

\- Scott Monument (outside only)

We’re mainly looking to wander around the city, enjoy the architecture, discover cute shops, bookstores, cozy cafés and restaurants and take in the views.

Am I missing any must-sees?

Should I remove anything from my list?

My boyfriend loves coffee. What are the best cafés to try, in your opinion?

Thanks in advance for your advice!",0,1771246065.0,uktravel,4,0.5,False
1r68pyt,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1r68pyt/barista_said_cold_foam_on_a_hot_drink_which_i/,Barista said cold foam on a hot drink (which I order nearly everyday) was **against policy** and she refused to make it,"This was the most bizarre thing I've ever heard. I always order a cafe misto and add a cold foam to give the drink a flavor.  I order it on the app all the time without issue. 

Once or twice when ordering this drink in person, I've had a barista say the foam will melt really fast. I usually respond that it's okay and I still want it. I used to get whipped cream on other hot drinks and that melts fast too. With whipped, sometimes it would be gone before I even got the drink. 

Anyway, as mentioned I was ordering my drink (which I order nearly 3-4 times a week) from a location that doesn't take mobile orders. And the barista made a big deal about it saying she couldn't put cold foam on a hot drink because it was ""against company policy.""  I told her I always order the same drink and have even ordered it from that location before. She made no suggestions on what she could substitute or that I could order that would be similar, she just kept quoting this mythical policy that only she seems to know and follow.

I'm not a coffee aficionado so maybe I'm missing something but it was just a very weird situation and she was rude about it. 

Also, if it's truly ""against policy"" I highly doubt the app offer cold foam has an option on a hot drink.

1r68ncw,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1r68ncw/aita_for_not_going_on_a_date/,AITA for not going on a date,"Okay so this is a weird one for me. Pardon any formatting as im writing this on mobile. Little side tangent im a super huge fan of two hot takes and listen to it every night at work 🖤 

OKAY onto the meat and tatos of the matter

Little backstory I 28m Sebastian recently asked a friend out on a date. We met at her work about 5 years ago. Works at this cute little cafe across the street from my house, and I go there every friday I get the same thing. My friend 32f let's call her Juli would ask me about my day remark about hers and talk about local music,  which it came onto the topic later that im a local musician in the metal scene. She wanted to come to a show so I invited her, on occasion we'd start going to shows together hanging out and got really close. Even bonded over music and our mutual disdain for certain bands. 

Now. When we were out for coffee at tims a few weeks ago after work. I bit the bullet and decided to ask her out to dinner prefaced that it was a date. and she seemed super excited said yes and we set up a plan from there a few days came and went. it was the night before the planned date and she didn't message back, so I thought shit am i getting ghosted? So I went to bed and woke up the next morning to a number I did not recognize. It read 

""hey Sebastian im one of Juli's coworkers I've seen you come in sometimes and I think you're cute.

After a bit of texting with her coworker she mentioned she was 45. Recently divorced with 3 kids. Which really isn't my thing. I delicately told her verbatim ""you seem really nice but that's just not what im looking for and I'm really weirded out that Juli just gave my number to someone I do not know"" which prompted the response ""bald guys dont get to be choosey"" then blocked me.

Now I want to try the single basket (9–11g) with 10g coffee.

If I want the same taste, should I go for 20g out? And how long should it take, around 15–16 seconds or longer and closer to 27–30?

Do I need to change the grind setting when switching to the single basket, or can I keep the same setting?

I'm all over the place with what I read. Genres of interest include (but not limited to) sci-fi, philosophy, bit of non-fiction. Currently going through Neverwhere (Neil Gaiman) and Philip K. Dick's Time Out of Joint.   
  
Just finished ""Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said"" (PKD) and a short story by Harlan Ellison called ""Repent, Harlequin!"", both of which were absolutely fantastic.

I also read manga, currently  rereading JJK but have read through Berserk, blue box and some of the later HxH chapters.

Would be nice to have people to discuss books with, either online (Discord etc) or grab a coffee in person if you're local. Got a Goodreads and Anilist if anyone wants to see what else I've read.

A bit about myself, lived in TWells for most of my life, went to University for a BEng and then MSc, now I'm back for the meantime, and have few people to discuss books with.

SO I feel extra happy when I manage to master a good homemade recipe that can replace laundry detergents or shampoo or such. My latest win is the body scrub made from used coffee grinds and coconut oil:

* One part coconut oil (warm and liquid, I think many other similar oils work)
* One part brown sugar (normal sugar must work too)
* Two parts coffee grinds

Mix the sugar and coffee well, then slowly add the coconut, mixing it well. Let the concoction cool wherever, preferably a slightly cooler place. Don't do like me and put it in the fridge, it gets really solid and hard to use. Use this body scrub once or twice a week; it works well as a face mask too. It is the best scrub I ever used, and the coconut leaves my skin really soft. 

  
The coffee grinds can also be used as a plant fertiliser. Do you know of any other uses? Please share!",6,1771245642.0,Anticonsumption,10,1.0,False

I’m quite used to chronic cases of wing and leg breaks with ongoing infections and signs of starvation but this time we had one of the most acute cases I’ve ever seen. Right after admission, hour after hour she started to decline - I knew she had a nasty break requiring amputation but this was faster than I expected, and pain alone didn’t explain why. 

I rushed to my vet in the middle of the night. It turned out she had developing sepsis. The break itself was closed one but god knows how, the bacteria still found their way to spread through her body. It was bloody, stinky and nasty. There was no time to waste - either we’d operate her here and now or I’d have no one to pick up tomorrow. I didn’t sleep that night just counting hours and waiting for my phone to ring. I didn’t even require my usual coffee to stay awake. There was one thing running around my mind - it’s too late for her, you haven’t returned any bird from sepsis, accept that and don’t be naive.

Next morning - ‘Eva is alive, she’s mad and wants to kill us all, when you have the opportunity to pick her up from our clinic?’. I couldn’t be more delighted!

This was a month ago. Now Eva healed nicely. We managed to know each other well. Despite lacking the entire wing she’s a real bundle of energy and nothing can stop her. She started to translate flight movements into running with her wing opened to compensate her needs and became pretty good at that. She can jump, sometimes does that famous tap dance, preens, makes long baths and vocalizes as a normal bird. Maybe she’s not top tier of my gulls’ hierarchy but - man, she knows a lot of things. After my top dogs come and go, Eva takes the stage and always figures out something new!",26,1771245637.0,Seagulls,1,1.0,False
