1nilnwh,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/1nilnwh/10_interview_tips_from_a_current_t10_student/,10 Interview Tips from a Current T10 Student + Interview Coach,"Hey Gang,

Ugh, that title was pretentious and obnoxious to write BUT hopefully it got your attention. It's interview season! While most II's have not yet gone out, it's a good time to think about how to best perform in the interviews that you do get. I'm going to go through some of the most high-yield tips for how to perform really well in your interviews. I have worked as an interview coach for a very long time, and these are some of the tips that my clients have found most helpful. Please add any more advice/tips that you have!

1. **Understand that the interview is a vibe check:** If you got an interview at a program, that means they are 100% confident in your ability to succeed there. So you need to recalibrate your brain to realize what they're actually looking for in an interview. They do not doubt that you are smart enough, hard-working enough, or disciplined enough to succeed in medical school. At this point, they just want to see if you would be the kind of person they actually want in their program. So above all else, you need to bring warmth, humanity, and charm to this interview\*\*.\*\* They aren't worried that you won't be a capable student or able to pass STEP 2; they're worried you're not the kind of person they'd want to stay up late studying alongside, or grab a coffee with before class. Coming across as warm, friendly, and personable is much more important in the interview than bragging about your MCAT, your research, or your accomplishments. It's a vibe check, so bring good vibes!

   * Note: this doesn't mean you need to be the most extroverted or outgoing person, it just means you need to come across as a pleasant and kind person. Genuine friendliness, good manners, positive body language (open posture, lots of smiles, nodding while they speak) and things like that are going to go much farther than you think.

1. **Anecdotes are king**. Ok, so we established that the purpose of the interview is really for them to get to know you, given that they already think you're qualified. But many of the questions you'll be asked are dangerously easy to answer with some boring response that drones on for 2-3 minutes without actually *telling* them anything. This bores your interviewer, while wasting precious time. You may think the answer paints you as competent, but remember, they aren't looking for competent; they're looking for human. I'm going to borrow some advice from the discipline of creative writing: **show don't tell**. Humans are storytelling animals, and stories stick with people. They also convey ideas much more easily for those who struggle to talk about themselves. If they ask what your biggest strength is, don't tell them it's time management; describe what it was like to work 3 jobs, go to school at night, and be the caregiver of your sick father while he went through chemotherapy. Have a few stories that you can pull out of your back pocket and incorporate them anywhere you can in the interview. Just having 5-10 stories that you can fall back on as a safety net can be such a helpful way to give yourself great answers to pretty much any question, and be a memorable and personable candidate!
2. **Have a really, really good answer to the inevitable ""Why us"" question**. If there is one question that you need to nail, it's this one. Yes, I know we all joke about cutting and pasting the same crappy secondary for ""why us,"" but this is different. And I don't mean tell them that they have great research, commitment to working with underserved populations, and clinical excellence. Go beyond the first page of their website. This is one of the easiest ways for schools to distinguish between people who are serious about the program and people who just shotgun-blast applied to 40+ programs without any regard for which one they attend. If you know a few volunteer programs/clinics they run, a PI doing cool research that you're interested in, and can make an off-the-cuff reference to how they structure their curriculum, you will be *golden* in their eyes. Spend a long time researching, and have a good few programs/PIs/clinics you can name-drop. It makes a huge difference if you can actually sell the interviewer on the fact that *you want to go there*.
3. **Don't ""step on the landmines"" in the common questions**. There are 3 questions that I *very* regularly see clients bomb, each in their own way:
   * ""What is your biggest weakness?"" - **This is your chance to highlight self-awareness and growth-mindedness.** The best answers to this question say ""Here's an area I've identified as an area of growth, here's what I'm do to work on it, here's how that has gone."" Do not give a cop out answer like ""I have bad handwriting"" or ""I'm too much of a perfectionist."" Likewise, don't just throw out ""I'm lazy"" or ""I struggle to empathize with others"" (You would not believe what I have heard lol).
   * ""Why medicine not RN, NP, PA, etc"" - **Do not undermine anyone!** Most people have no idea how much their answers come across as a slag to these professions! You cannot say *anything whatsoever* that could be even slightly misconstrued as a slag or negative point on any other role in the healthcare team. You don't know if your interviewer is a nurse, a PA, a doctor, or none of the above. SO many people say something like ""Doctors make the biggest impact on patient care"" or ""doctors are the ones with the most expertise and know-how, so that's what I want to do."" How do you think a nurse or a PA is going to hear that? It comes across like you don't value these roles, and view doctors as above them. Even though it's essentially inarguable that a cardiology has ""more expertise"" than a cardiology PA, you really need to be very careful. Anything that could potentially be viewed as a slag on other professions should be avoided like the plague. Instead, talk about the way that the role of the doctor is *different* than the role of the nurse/np/pa, and that while each member of the team is vital, you are attracted to the specific kind of tasks that the doctor does.
      * Here's a sample answer: *""Yeah, this is a great question that I actually spent a few years wrestling with myself. My grandfather was a surgeon, and my grandmother was a nurse. He used to joke that if every doctor in the country quit, hospitals would be shut down by the end of the week; but if every nurse in the country quit, hospitals would be shut down by lunchtime. Originally, I was actually under the impression that I wanted to be a nurse myself, I didn't really have much interest in pursuing a career as a doctor. But after I got some clinical experience as a medical assistant and a CNA, I realized that the work of a nurse and the work of a doctor were totally different. I saw that while nurses are doing so much of the vital hands-on patient care, I found myself more drawn to the work that the doctors were doing. I think of the job of the physician as having three parts: detective, architect, and clergy. He was a detective because he had to ""solve the mystery"" of diagnosing each patient properly, he was an architect because he had to be the vision-caster who sketched up plans for how to take care of the patient, and he was a clergyman because he also had to provide emotional and even spiritual support to the patients he was working with. This all appeals to me so much, and once I realized this I felt like I would be a better fit pursuing a career as a physician.""*
   * ""Tell me about your research"" - **This is the most common cause of eyes-glazed-over boredom.** this is a question that makes *many* people drone on about their incredibly dull research. Pick one or two aspects of your research that are sexy and exciting, and share those. Don't assume your interviewer has *any* background in science whatsoever. If they aren't a specialist in your field, they probably don't want to hear a 3-minute speech about whatever thing you're doing. I'm sure it's cool - but you have to make it sound cool! Don't present like you're at a research conference, present like you're sitting next to someone at a bar trying to get them to think it's cool! I could talk about the ways that we determine epidemiological rates of Addison's Disease and how both the genetic and environmental facets of its etiology are determined... Or I could say that I take hair samples from people and dissolve it to quantify their stress levels, and see which diseases are best predicted by stress. Which do you think an interviewer wants to hear more about?
4. **Practice, practice, practice**. I think even just doing one practice interview is *hugely* beneficial, but I would recommend you do a handful just to give yourself the best odds of success. No need to go overkill with this, but doing 2-3 puts you at a huge advantage to doing none! It's also very helpful to record yourself during practice interviews. Listen back to the recording, and see what you think. Here are the biggest red flags my clients do that you should watch out for:
   * **Length of your answers**: Your answer should not be a single sentence, and your answer should not be multiple minutes long. There are a few questions that sort of demand a lengthier answer, so don't be afraid to talk for a while if it's appropriate, but avoid yapping at all costs. You would not believe how common it is for interviewers to hop to a different tab on their computer, think of something else completely, or even doze off when someone is blabbering. It's a waste of your time and theirs. It's fine to talk for a while if you're being interesting, but don't just yap to fill the space.
   * **Timing and pace**: Lots of people (I'd say about 20%) who I do practice interviews with are speaking much faster than they should. For a lot of people, it's a nervous thing. I was the same way. I had to put a lot of conscious effort into keeping a slow and steady pace. There are lots of ways to mitigate this: you can continually record yourself, try to work it out through practice, or use some kind of ""tempo keeping"" strategy. For instance, one thing I found helpful was to hold something small in my hand (like a pen) and gesture with it as I spoke. This kind of forced me to slow down, and made me feel a lot more deliberate with my words.
   * **Filler words**: ""Like,"" ""Umm,"" ""Yeah,"" and ""Really"" are all common examples, but everyone has them. You may not even be aware of them, but I *promise* you have them. This is the value of recording yourself and listening back, or doing practice interviews with someone who actually knows what to look for. This is another thing that you just need to very consciously work to root out in yourself. When I was doing prep interviews with a friend, I gave them a buzzer from a board game and had them hit it every time I said ""like""
5. **Master the optics of Zoom**. Most people flip open their laptops in their nice outfits and call it a day. This is not the best option. Like it or not, aesthetics play a role in how you are perceived. If you're going to nail the interview, you are going to do the following:

   * You are going to **dress appropriately** for a formal business setting.
   * You are going to have the **camera** of your laptop **at or slightly above eye level**
   * You are *not* going to look at your computer screen. This is where your interviewer's ""face"" will be, and it's hard to resist the urge. Instead, **you will look at the camera of your laptop**. This will simulate eye contact *much* better. Stick two googley eyes on either side of your camera lens if you have to.
   * You are going to have a **plain, neutrally colored background** behind you.
   * You are going to have a **single potted green houseplant** behind you, and nothing else.
   * You are going to be **lit from the front**, not from the back

1. **Take your time**. There is nothing wrong with pausing to answer a question. In fact, it's actually *much* better to say ""Wow, that's a great question. Can I have a moment to think about an answer?"" Than to start talking when you don't have anything appropriate to say. You don't need to have the answer ready in 0.1 seconds. That said, you should probably have one in, like, 5-10 seconds, but that's a completely acceptable pause to take. You'll often come across as much more thoughtful and considerate this way!
2. **Try to make a genuine connection with your interviewer as early as possible**. This can be something as simple and small as being from the same state, having an interest in the field they practice in, or having read a book that's on the shelf behind them. I started every interview off by properly introducing myself, asking the interviewer their name, and then sincerely saying something like ""How's the day been treating you so far?"" or something like that. It's a small thing, but they're people too who have to slog through a million interviews, and it gets pretty boring. Being a positive spot in their day puts them in your corner, which is a huge advantage as a candidate. Don't be afraid to ask questions, either! There are a lot of times where they'll ask a follow-up question or you'll say something that can spark a bit of a dialogue, and that's a great way to build a connection with them! At the end of the interview, sincerely thank them for their time, and express your gratitude for the privilege of interviewing at the school. It really goes a long way!
3. **Ask thoughtful questions that you couldn't have just looked up on your own**. This interviewer probably has very strong positive associations with this school. Ask them how working here has shaped them as a professional, or what brought them to this institution. Don't waste their time by asking how long the pre-clinical didactic years are.
4. **For MMIs: There is almost never a right/wrong answer.** Typically, you will be presented with an ethical dilemma, and they want to see how you react. Unless you suggest something that is downright  unethical (violating patient autonomy, causing harm, violating patient privacy, etc.) you will be fine. It's often much more about seeing how you reach the conclusions you come to than it is judging your ultimate decision. Use the time before you have to give your answer to come up with a good, thorough outline of what you want to say. Identify the dilemma, figure out who the ""stakeholders"" are, weigh the options, and pick whichever choice you think has the best effect.

Example MMI: You are shopping directly after a long shift in the OR. While walking down one of the aisles, you notice a woman with 2 young children. She appears unkempt and disheveled. Her cart is mostly empty, and she is repeatedly looking up and down the aisle as she walks. A few minutes later, you see her again, and notice that she is shoplifting baby formula. How do you proceed?

Now, there are a few options here. Do you ignore it and pretend not to see anything? Do you approach her and draw attention to the fact that you saw what she did? Do you alert a store manager?

Here's a sample answer: ""This is a heartbreaking situation. I know that poverty and desperation can drive people to extremes that they otherwise would never reach. While I don't condone stealing, I completely understand the lengths a mother would go to in order to feed her children. There are a few considerations. Firstly, if it is even my place to intervene at all; should I simply ignore it and move on? Secondly, if I do intervene, should I say something to the woman or to the store management? Of these options, I think I am least likely to consider reporting her to store management. I just don't see that as an option that creates very much good for anyone, and brings about the most suffering for an already struggling mother. If she's in this position, her life is hard enough; the last thing she needs is legal trouble. I do think that in a situation like this, it is appropriate to try and say something. I would privately and respectfully approach the mother and ask her if she would let me buy the items she had with her (including the baby formula). I was raised by a single mother, and I know what a struggle it can be to bring up a family by yourself. Doing this centers the mother's honorable desire (feeding her family) while also removing any risk to her by taking away any illicit or illegal aspect. It is also most just to the store owner, as nothing was stolen""

The interviewer is likely to ask follow-up questions from there, depending on your answer. For instance, if you said that you would not intervene, they may say something like ""Does it change your answer if the store has a heavy security presence that is likely to catch her?"" or even ""What if it isn't a large supermarket chain, but a local struggling mom-and-pop store?"" Just to see how you can extend this ethical thinking to different situations. There's no ""wrong answer"" here, it's just a matter of seeing how you think and react to different prompts!",3,1758038756.0,premed,2,1.0,False

1nilmwc,https://i.redd.it/wvvruiumvjpf1.jpeg,Previous filling or tooth decay info attached,"So I have a massive phobia of dentists and needles and haven't been to one since 2018 but as a result i take good care of my teeth brushing 2-3x daily with an electric Toothbrush, flossing daily (since about 2022), using a water flosser when I remember, and i use 0% alcohol mouthwash after eating anything suggary or acidic and I'm basically just always extremely anxious and paranoid about my teeth. 

I believe my top back left molar chipped without me realising and now has a sharp edge, this has exposed an area of the tooth to me that I couldn't previously see... it's grey/black there so not really any pain at all in the tooth with pressure, heat/cold, or sweet things and the grey/black area is not soft I prodded it with a tooth pick and scraped it with my nail and nothing comes off and it feels hard not spongy and again no pain. I also don't have bad breath or at least have not been told I do and I do have people I would truth to have told me that.

The thing is I had silver fillings put in when I was 15 but I was under general anaesthetic due to the extreme phobia of needles and it was over a decade ago and I can't remember if I had one in this tooth or not as far as I remember I only had them in my bottom teeth but I might have just forgot since I haven't been able to see that tooths surface before now...

I know there are 2 smaller black/brown spots visable also but i have these on many teeth and did have when I used to go to the dentist and they said they were okay and just staining likely due to me drinking lots of coffee so I'm hoping it's the same on this tooth and those are just stains.

I know its an awful picture but it's the best i could take I've taken many and it's the most clear out of all of them, based on the info provided do you think it's likely tooth decay or do you think im an idiot whos forgot they have a filling in that tooth? Should i be concernerd?

The issue is my phobia is extreme and the waiting list in my area is years long for NHS treatment and private isn't an option for me.

Currently juggling buying & selling a house, Dadding a 15 month old who hates sleep and doesn't want to eat(still amazing and love him to death, but he's a lot of work), a recently pregnant Wife, doing an online degree, and prepping for a big work trip to Mexico for 2 weeks, a week after we move.

Why are we doing this you may ask? Well, it's been a year of ups and downs, my workplace closed up early this year. Thankfully I managed to get a much higher paying job out of that ordeal though, much more stable too. Downside is the new job comes with some travel and is on the other side of town. But where my new job is located is very close to the in-laws and is one of the top cities for young families so we started shooting around the idea of moving there down the line. Once we found out the Wife was pregnant we started looking a little more seriously and ended up putting an offer on a house and it surprisngly got accepted. It'll be a lot better being close to the Wifes family and support, especially when I have to travel, and the schools are great, lots of kids in the area, etc.

We're excited & confident it'a all going to pay off and be worth it in the end, but holy shit it's a lot lol

A true tale of psychological manipulation and hunting KPIs (statistical key performance indicator¬† we use in game-marketing, only good for a ""short-term analysis"") over creating a game for the sole purpose of being fun or a transformative experience and how the average player is ‚Äúloving it‚Äù while in the process of dying. All in all, this is why mobile gaming will never recover from the dire state it is now and things will only get worst.

But let‚Äôs start our little story of insanity from the beginning.

You know, from my perspective as a developer today, it‚Äôs wild to look back at the history of mobile gaming. Even before I was in the industry, back when I was just a kid with a flip-phone, the games we had were these tiny J2ME apps. They were simplistic novelties, really. If you wanted a real, immersive gaming experience on the move, you needed a dedicated handheld. That was the rule.

The Game Boy Advance, and later the PSP and DS, were entirely different beasts. They were built from the ground up as gaming platforms with a proper HID‚Äîa Human Interface Device. Having physical buttons, D-pads, and analog sticks gives you a platform for precise control, which is critical for immersion. On those platforms, you could get deep, premium experiences. I remember spending countless hours on my PSP with titles like¬†*God of War: Chains of Olympus*, Midnight Club 3 and Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories; they were technical marvels that felt like home console games. Up to that point, ""portable gaming"" meant a dedicated console, and phones just weren't in the same league.

When the first iPhone and the App Store came out, everything changed. I had one of the first iPod Touches, and the intuitive nature of touching the screen was a completely new design paradigm. The early games were a blast, but the novelty wore off pretty quickly for me. The lack of precision was a real issue. A year or two later, I was back to carrying a PSP Go in my pocket for my commute because it just offered a better experience.

Still, that period gave us a glimpse of what could have been. We saw this brief, golden age of premium mobile games. Titles like¬†*Infinity Blade*¬†(2010), built on Unreal Engine 3, proved high-fidelity graphics were possible. EA's mobile¬†*Dead Space*¬†was a fantastic horror story, and¬†*Dungeon Defenders*¬†felt like a proper PC port of a proper full game. These were complete experiences you paid for.

But then came the rise of the games that by design had psychological triggers aimed at extracting¬† certain response from the player, and the financial reality of the market was brutal. The success of free-to-play games like¬†*Clash of Clans*¬†and¬†*Candy Crush Saga*¬†in 2012 completely rewrote the rules from the publisher‚Äôs side. You see ‚Ä¶ the industry works by appealing to the markets ‚Äì a slave to quarterly profit ‚Äì they fell for the revenue numbers and they were so massive that the industry's focus shifted almost overnight from making complete products to engineering retention loops. The mechanics were built around monetizing player frustration‚Äîselling time, selling second chances. It created a business model that was just too profitable to ignore.

This is the legacy we‚Äôve inherited. The conversations in design meetings are almost always anchored by monetization and retention KPIs. Despite the incredible power of the devices in our pockets today, the business models in place actively discourage the creation of the kind of deep, premium experiences that once defined portable gaming.

And what's happening now is that a real, palpable fatigue has set in. As developers, we see it in the player data, and as gamers, we feel it ourselves. The constant notifications, the daily login rewards, the battle passes, the limited-time events‚Äîit's all designed to create a fear of missing out and transform a hobby into a commitment. The games demand your constant attention, but they rarely give you a satisfying conclusion. They aren't designed to end; they're designed to continue indefinitely, and that can be incredibly draining.

This is why so many people are turning to emulation on their phones. There's this beautiful irony in using a cutting-edge smartphone, a device born from the ecosystem that killed the premium handheld, to resurrect that very experience. Firing up an emulator and loading a PSP game feels like an act of rebellion. The difference is night and day.

When you play a game like¬†*God of War: Chains of Olympus*¬†through an emulator, you're getting a complete, self-contained product. It was designed from start to finish to provide a thrilling, paced, and ultimately finite experience. There are no ads to break your immersion. There are no timers stopping your progress. There are no pop-ups asking you to buy a bundle of gems. It's just you and the game, a pure and honest transaction. The controls might be mapped to a touchscreen or a connected controller like a Gamesir G8, but the core experience is one of respect for the player's time and intelligence. It feels better than almost any modern freemium game because it was built to be a great game, not a great monetization platform.

And baffled as I am, finding myself rather play almost 20-year-old games in my 1000$ flagship phone, I come face-to-face with the great paradox that used to perplex me before I joined the big tech industry as an engineer, went to the conventions and talked to the actual Devs. From a business standpoint, mobile gaming is bigger than ever. The revenue charts keep going up, so by that metric, it's ""on the rise"" but the ‚ÄúGOOD‚Äù games never come to the mobile platform, we always get an inferior watered-down version of the same game ‚Äì adjusted for microtransactions and limited interactivity ‚Äì it‚Äôs almost an insult to our intelligence. But having seen the industry from the inside out, I know that money talks and our work is secondary and for the mobile platform financial success is built on the back of the freemium model, a model that, from a design perspective, absolutely sucks the soul out of what we do; and while porting a game from a modern engine to ARM is not that hard, and also modern GPUs support VULKAN 1.3, companies prefer to NOT give you access to the IP and wait for a soul-sucking money-grabbing version of the franchise to be built instead ‚Äì because this is the way the vast majority of mobile consumers prefers it ‚Äì free AT ALL COSTS. And this model is here to stay, not because it produces the best games, but because it‚Äôs the most effective at extracting money. And because the consumer DEMANDS every mobile game to be a free experience ‚Äì unwilling to pay ‚Äì and so the ‚ÄúGOOD‚Äù games will NEVER come to the mobile market ‚Äì no matter its size.

And honestly, I have thought this through a lot, you have to place a huge amount of the blame on the players themselves ‚Äì not the entire community - but a certain demographic that fed the charts that the already rotten hyper-capitalistic system needed to see in order to tip-over. In essence, we got here because of a fundamental choice the market made over a decade ago. At large, the player base voted with their wallets‚Äîor rather, with their refusal to open them. They demonstrated, on a massive scale, that they would rather spend nothing and receive a vastly inferior, psychologically manipulative product than pay even a small, fair price for a good one. It's a consumer behavior that devalues the craft. We're talking about interactive art, experiences that a team of passionate people poured years into, and the market consensus was that it should be free. I come face-to-face time and time again with people being absolutely adamant that EVERY piece of software in their mobile device should be free or offer grate value under a subscription service and how they are willing to endure the ads if said subscription was to be offered for free instead. The true killer of mobile gaming is the societal problem of people not valuing their time enough and deciding to exchange based on instantaneous (and vastly exploitable, apparently) feelings rather than transact based on logic in order to receive an item of vastly greater value.

It‚Äôs this weird alignment where people are more comfortable being the product‚Äîbeing sold to advertisers or slowly milked for microtransactions‚Äîthan being a customer who pays for a finished piece of art. They'll endure hours of ads or grind through tedious, time-gated mechanics to avoid a five-dollar price tag. The result is an ecosystem that rewards the most aggressive monetization, not the most creative or fulfilling gameplay. The human experience, the potential for a game to provide real value and leave a lasting impression, gets buried under layers of retention mechanics and purchase prompts.

That‚Äôs the part that, as a developer, is just maddening to watch, and it happens every single day. The market is absolutely a mirror of the consumer's refusal to pay for things that provide value back to themselves. This overwhelming preference for ""free"" created the monster, and it's a form of consumer greed‚Äîthe desire to get hundreds of hours of entertainment, a product of immense technical and creative effort, without paying a cent upfront. This choice created a market where players aren't customers; they are a resource to be harvested, either through their data, their ad views, or their vulnerability to psychological spending triggers.

It‚Äôs an economic model built on what seems like utter insanity, when you step back and look at it. You see it play out in real life all the time. Picture a guy sitting at a caf√©. He‚Äôll drop five, maybe six bucks on an overpriced ‚Äúlatte macchiato double-cream whatever‚Äù without a second thought. He'll pull out a pack of cigarettes that cost him another five or six bucks and chain-smoke his way through half of it, ignoring everyone around him. He‚Äôs staring intently at his 500$ or even 1000$ smartphone, tapping away at a game he downloaded for free because the idea of paying even $2.99 for a ""premium"" game is somehow an outrageous rip-off in his mind.

He's actively consuming two products that offer fleeting, momentary satisfaction, costing him over ten dollars, while simultaneously engaging with a piece of complex interactive software he believes he is entitled to for free. He‚Äôll endure an ad after every single round, he'll wait for his energy to refill, he'll put up with a user experience that is objectively terrible and designed to frustrate him. He does all of this to avoid a one-time fee that's less than what he just paid for his coffee and smokes combined. And he loves every moment of it, he wants MORE! This is masochism!

And here‚Äôs the truly insane part: an hour later, a pop-up appears in that ""free"" game offering a new legendary cosmetic skin for his character at a supposed ‚Äúdiscount‚Äù. It does NOTHING and costs more than Witcher3 on a sale, offers no gameplay advantage and doesn‚Äôt change the gameplay loop. It's literally just a different set of models over the character‚Äôs skeleton. And that same person, who refused to pay a few dollars for a complete, well-crafted, ad-free experience, will pull out his credit card and drop twenty bucks on that skin without blinking. This is a terminal fault built into human nature, exploited to the Nth degree by big corporations and the rotten governmental structure does nothing through ‚Äúeducation‚Äù to fix it at a young age.

It is absolute, certifiable madness. But it's the perfect illustration of the evil psychological genius of the freemium model. The model isn't designed to appeal to a person's sense of rational value. It's designed to bypass it entirely. It hooks them with a ""free"" investment of their time‚Äîthe sunk cost‚Äîand then leverages social status, impulse, and carefully engineered desire to trigger a large, irrational purchase. He didn't buy a game; he bought a feeling. And we, as developers in this ecosystem, are no longer in the business of selling games. We're in the business of selling feelings, for twenty bucks a pop.

In fact, when you step back, the entire mobile gaming market is an anomaly. It's a feedback loop of greed, fed from both sides. From the publisher side, the greed is obvious. It‚Äôs the data-driven obsession with maximizing ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) and LTV (Lifetime Value). You see, big companies design games around analytics, not just fun. Every feature is A/B tested to see which one makes people play longer or spend more. It's the only segment of the industry where the most profitable products are the ones that are, by design, often the most annoying. We literally sell the cure to the friction we intentionally create. But the consumer side is just as complicit as stated above. The market is a mirror of their refusal to pay for things. The overwhelming preference for ""free"" created this monster. It's a form of consumer greed‚Äîthe desire to get hundreds of hours of entertainment, a product of immense technical and creative effort, without paying a cent upfront.

And then you get to the really cynical stuff, the part we see in high-level corporate meetings. You can't separate a game like¬†*Call of Duty: Mobile*¬†or¬†*Diablo Immortal*¬†from the publicly traded behemoths that own them. These companies are not just game studios; they are massive corporations with shareholders, investment funds, and a constant need to manage their public image. When you see big-budget mobile games suddenly incorporating overt political or social messaging, it‚Äôs hard not to see the corporate playbook.

From the inside, it often feels less like genuine artistic expression and more like a calculated, brand-safe form of corporate PR. It's a way to whitewash the name of the company for the big capitalist investors who are increasingly concerned with ESG scores and public perception. It‚Äôs a way to signal virtue to a certain market segment and generate positive headlines that can offset the negative press that inevitably comes from having a business model based on what are essentially slot machine mechanics. It‚Äôs a layer of paint to make the machine look friendly, to make you forget that the core engine is designed to profit from what are often the most exploitative aspects of human psychology.

Because of this triple lethal combination between \[insane consumer behavior\] ‚Äì \[capital greed\] ‚Äì \[corporate whitewashing through politics in media\] , I genuinely believe mainstream mobile gaming, as we know it, is lost for good. The F2P model is a gravity well; the financial incentives are so powerful that it's nearly impossible for major studios to escape it. We‚Äôre not going to see a widespread return to premium, story-driven mobile exclusives. The market has been conditioned for a decade to expect ""free,"" and the most profitable path will always be to give them that, along with all the baggage that comes with it.

But that‚Äôs why emulation is becoming so much more than just a retro hobby. It's the light at the end of the tunnel for the mobile gaming dark age we're in. It's the ultimate escape hatch. For years, we've had fantastic emulation for classic consoles, but the real game-changer now is the progress being made in Windows emulation on Android. Thanks to projects like Winlator, the idea of running PC games on our phones is no longer a pipe dream.

Think about what that means. It‚Äôs not just about playing old console games anymore. We're talking about having access to decades of PC gaming history‚Äîsome of the deepest, most complex, and most beloved premium games ever made‚Äîrunning natively on the device in your pocket. The entire Steam and GOG back catalog becomes your potential library. You can play the Batman series games on steam, The Witcher games from gog or an indie masterpiece like¬†*Hollow Knight: Silksong*¬†without ads, without timers, and without a single microtransaction. It's the final frontier for portable gaming, completely bypassing the broken mobile market. It proves that the hardware was never the problem; it was always the business model, the way marketing analysis dictates a studio‚Äôs output and rotten behavior by the consumer. Emulation is how we finally get the premium, uncompromised gaming experience that our powerful mobile devices have deserved all along.

As a final light to the tunnel, comes the rise of mobile gamepads like the Backbone and Kishi, and this new wave of Android devices designed with built-in controllers and docking station support‚Äîthat‚Äôs not a sign of mobile gaming's health. It‚Äôs a symptom of its failure. You see players trying to physically bolt a better experience onto their phones because the software ecosystem itself is so hostile to what makes a game good. They are trying to reintroduce a proper HID because the native interface, while brilliant for some things, has been largely ignored in favor of simple, monetization-friendly taps and swipes.",3,1758038319.0,Asmongold,1,0.8,False

I'm learning.  

My path:  

* I'm learning that a I'm lot less is bothersome than I previously thought.

* Sometimes, parts of me have struck out, demanding space.  So I can't blame others for not reaching out.  This puts an obligation on me to reach out.

* So now I reach out.  Not every day.  But I try to reach out and in essence say, ""want to hang out"" or ""want me to make supper tonight?"" ""Could you proofread this rant before I post it?""

* The key for me is reciprocity.  When reciprocity is unbalanced there's a problem.  If I'm the one reaching out all the time, or even 90% of the time, there is a lack of balance.  I'm trying too hard.

* People like to be asked for help.  People like to offer help.

* But if you get asked to dinner at someone's house only when they have a computer problem, there is a lack of balance.  

* When you get invited to the in-laws for Sunday Dinner every 6 weeks, but they never will come to my place for dinner, saying, ""It's too far"" there is a lack of balance.

* If I ask for help, and you never ask back, I'm a burden.  If you ask for help, and never make an offer, I see you as a burden, and obligation, a duty.

Does it have to be a perfect balance? No.  But overall I feel it should be within 2:1, subject to circumstances and abilities.

He occasionally has a tree question for me.  I was relieved this fall, when he asked me to clean his gutters.

I‚Äôve been coming here every morning for two months, and I‚Äôve watched him chat easily with nearly every other customer, spinning small talk into something more. I'm grateful our exchanges aren't as lengthy.¬†

I take my usual seat at the window, perching on the worn barstool, the city moving outside like a film reel. I watch people rush by, bundled in coats, shoulders hunched against the cold. A woman dragging a toddler by the wrist. A man balancing a cigarette between his lips while adjusting his tie. Someone lugging a cello case across the street, looking deeply unhappy about it.

I drink too quickly, as always, scalding my tongue on the first sip. The pain is sharp, immediate, but I don‚Äôt slow down. It‚Äôs part of the ritual now. The heat, the burn, the sharp contrast of cold air pressing against the glass.

I‚Äôm halfway through my coffee when he sits down. No warning, no asking. Just drops into the stool next to me, all effortless confidence and cologne. He puts a pack of cigarettes down in front of him.¬†

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù he says, smiling like we know each other.

I glance at him. ‚ÄúHi.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou come here a lot?‚Äù

I exhale slowly. ‚ÄúSure.‚Äù

He‚Äôs good-looking, I guess. Brown hair, sharp jawline, the kind of face that‚Äôs probably had success without trying too hard. He‚Äôs watching me, waiting for something.

I take another sip of coffee. Don‚Äôt look at him.

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I say.

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ Nate,‚Äù I say, tilting my head. ‚ÄúWhat do you do?‚Äù I start batting my eyelashes in an unnatural rapid way.¬†

He blinks at the sudden shift. ‚ÄúOh. I work in finance.‚Äù

I laugh. Too hard. ‚ÄúWow. That‚Äôs so‚Ä¶ impressive!‚Äù

‚ÄúUh‚Äîthanks?‚Äù He smiles, uncertain.

I lean toward him, brushing my hand over his arm. My nails trail down to his wrist. ‚ÄúGod, your jacket is so soft.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs suede,‚Äù he says. His smile is back, easier now.

‚ÄúOhhh,‚Äù I breathe. My hand drops casually to his thigh. Just resting there. Light pressure through the denim. He tenses, but in a good way.

He clears his throat. ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ what do you do?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, nothing exciting.‚Äù My fingers slip lower, brushing the edge of his pocket. I feel the cool metal shape of the lighter under my knuckles.

I laugh again, tilting my head toward his shoulder. He‚Äôs relaxed now, leaning in. I press my hand into his leg, and in one smooth motion, I slip the lighter free.

It slides into my sleeve like it belongs there.

I give his thigh one last squeeze and sit back. I smile sweetly.

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù he says, a little breathless. ‚ÄúMaybe I could‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúYou were going to smoke, right?‚Äù I say, pointing to the pack on the table. ‚ÄúI think it's really sexy when a man smokes.‚Äù I can't believe the ridiculous 9words coming out of my mouth.¬†

He steps outside. He's smiling at me through the window, I watch him dig through his pockets. First casual, then a bit frantic. He pats his jacket, his jeans. His mouth moves in a tight curse.

A minute later, he comes back inside.. He approaches, still smiling like he‚Äôs trying to play it cool.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúyou wouldn‚Äôt have a lighter, would you?‚Äù

I meet his gaze, all innocence.

‚ÄúNope,‚Äù I say.

He exhales through his nose. Laughs. ‚ÄúYeah. Okay. I think I lost mine.‚Äù¬†

I smile and blink at him cartoonishly.

‚ÄúLook I‚Äôm going to go to the store to buy one real quick, don't go anywhere okay?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôll be here,‚Äù I say.¬†

Under the table, out of his view I flip the lighter open and closed. Click. Click. Cold metal against my palm.

He smiles, turns, and hurries down the block. I watch his figure shrink into the distance. I finish my coffee in one gulp and leave.¬†

I slip into a Whole Foods next door, buzzing on whatever high this is. The weight of the lighter in my pocket is perfect‚Äî very exact. An ounce more and it‚Äôd be ruined. It was so easy.

She‚Äôd shift something in her face, raise her voice half an octave, soften the consonants. Like she was returning to a version of herself she thought they‚Äôd like better. They'd let her off with a warning. I‚Äôd stare out the window until it was over, pretend I couldn‚Äôt hear her apologizing for a taillight she‚Äôd already fixed.

The morning started the same way it always did.

Liam Carter woke to the sharp chirp of his alarm, blinking against the early gray light filtering through the window. He stretched, yawning, then swung his legs over the side of the bed. His apartment was small but neat, everything in its place‚Äîhis work uniform folded over the chair, his keys and watch lined up perfectly on the nightstand.

Routine. Familiar. Safe.

And yet, something was wrong.

He couldn‚Äôt explain it. Couldn‚Äôt even name it. It was just a feeling‚Äîa shadow at the edges of his mind, an itch he couldn‚Äôt quite scratch. Some mornings it was worse than others, a sense of unease so strong it made his breath hitch as he stood in the bathroom, staring at his reflection. A face he recognized but didn‚Äôt quite know.

He turned on the sink, splashing cold water onto his skin. The sensation grounded him. Made him feel present, real. He focused on the details‚Äîhis dark hair, neatly trimmed; the sharp angles of his jawline; the faint scar near his temple that he had no memory of earning.

He had lived in this apartment for two years. Worked at the distribution plant for nearly as long. Paid his bills on time. Never missed a shift.

A normal life.

So why did it feel borrowed?

Shaking off the thought, he dressed quickly and made his way down to the street. The city was waking around him, a symphony of car horns, distant sirens, and the low hum of morning conversations. He liked this part of the day‚Äîthe quiet before the world truly took hold, before work and responsibilities swallowed him whole.

At the corner caf√©, he ordered his usual: black coffee, no sugar. The barista greeted him by name, smiling as she handed him the cup.

‚ÄúLong night, Liam?‚Äù

He paused, fingers curling around the warmth of the cup. ‚ÄúSomething like that.‚Äù

She smirked, tossing a rag over her shoulder. ‚ÄúGuess that means it‚Äôs just another day.‚Äù

¬†

He forced a smile and moved to his usual table by the window. The same table he always chose. The same seat, the same view. Routine. Familiar. Safe.

And yet, today, something was different.

A man stood on the sidewalk, his figure unnaturally still, cloaked in a long, dark coat that seemed to drink in the surrounding light. He wasn‚Äôt looking at Liam‚Äî*not exactly*‚Äîbut the way his head tilted ever so slightly, as if listening, as if *aware*, sent an unnatural chill through Liam‚Äôs spine. There was something *wrong* about him, something just beyond the edge of recognition, like a figure glimpsed in a dream‚Äî*or a nightmare he had yet to remember.*

A strange unease settled in his chest. Something about the man was‚Ä¶ wrong. Familiar, yet entirely foreign.

His headache started immediately, sharp and suddenly. He pressed his fingers against his temple, breathing through the pain. When he looked up again, the man was gone.

The rest of the day passed in a blur. Work was the same as always‚Äîmonotonous, repetitive, a constant rhythm of labor and efficiency. By the time his shift ended, the headache had dulled to a steady throb, an ache that followed him home like an unwanted companion.

He stopped by the convenience store on the way back, picking up a frozen dinner and a six-pack of beer. The cashier gave him a polite nod, scanning his items with ease of muscle memory.

‚ÄúLong day?‚Äù she asked.

Liam exhaled. ‚ÄúSomething like that.‚Äù

She bagged his items, handing them over. ‚ÄúYou take care, now.‚Äù

He nodded, stepping back out into the evening air. The streetlights flickered to life, casting long shadows across the pavement. He turned toward his apartment‚Äîand froze.

The man from this morning stood at the end of the block.

Only this time, as Liam looked closer, his breath caught in his throat. The stranger‚Äôs features, the way he stood, the faint scar above his temple‚Äîit was all too familiar.

Liam was staring at himself.

No. Not *himself.*

A version of himself he didn‚Äôt recognize. The man was older, his face hardened, his stance more rigid, exuding a quiet confidence Liam lacked. But the resemblance was unmistakable.

A cold wave of nausea rolled through him, his legs locking in place. His mind screamed for an answer, but none came.

Who was this man? Why did he look exactly like him, yet completely different?

Liam‚Äôs pulse pounded in his ears; his hands clammy around the plastic bag. He tried to breathe, to make sense of it. But no matter how he turned the thoughts over in his mind, one truth lingered, gnawing at his sanity.

This man *shouldn‚Äôt* exist.

And yet, he did.

The stranger‚Äîhis reflection made flesh‚Äîheld his gaze, unblinking, eyes dark and depthless, as if peering *through* him, past flesh and bone, into something deeper, something nameless. The moment stretched, thick and suffocating, reality warping around its edges. Then, with an eerie smoothness, he turned‚Äîtoo fluid, too precise‚Äîslipping around the corner like a shadow dissolving into the dark.

A sharp jolt of panic snapped through Liam‚Äôs chest.

*No‚Äîno, he can‚Äôt just disappear.*

His feet moved before his mind could catch up, his breath breaking into uneven gasps as he lunged forward, his pulse hammering in his skull. His shoes slapped against the pavement, his heart screaming with a nameless urgency.

He rounded the corner‚Äî*too late*. The street stretched out empty before him, the shifting glow of neon signs casting eerie afterimages against the wet asphalt. No movement. No sign of anyone at all.

But he *had* been here.

Liam staggered to a halt, chest heaving, his fingers fumbling for his phone. He swiped at the screen, but the moment his contact list blinked open, his stomach turned to ice.

Empty.

Only work numbers. Automated services. No family. No friends.

No history.

Liam swallowed hard, a strange hollowness curling in his gut. The question echoed in his mind, circling like a vulture over something already dead.

*Who am I?*

¬†

***Chapter 7: Below the Surface***

Alastor kaine‚Äôs estate was perched atop a breathtaking cliffside, overlooking an expanse of wild, untamed ocean. The mansion itself was a masterpiece of modern architecture‚Äîsharp lines, glass walls, and pristine black steel that seemed to defy the rugged landscape surrounding it. The world outside was serene, tranquil, as if untouched by time.

But beneath that beauty, buried deep below the opulent halls and carefully curated perfection, lay the basement.

The basement straddled the edge of the outside world, the air thick with dampness and the sharp, metallic sting of something unnatural. Overhead, industrial lights buzzed erratically, their flickering glow carving restless shadows against the cold steel walls. The scent of sweat and dust clung to the space, but beneath it lurked something deeper‚Äîsomething *rotting*, Something *fouler.* Something *unnamed.* Something that didn‚Äôt just linger in the air‚Äîit *unsettled* it.

The scholars, artists, and martial artists sat bound in a semi-circle, their wrists and ankles shackled to the steel chairs bolted into the floor. Their breaths were ragged, their eyes darting between each other and the sleek, sterile transfer chamber looming in the center of the basement.

A man was already inside the chamber, his entire body rigid, muscles straining against the instinct to flee. He trembled as he waited, watching the door, hoping, praying for a reprieve that would never come.

The machine beside him purred softly, its neural interfaces glowing with a quiet, predatory hunger. It was ready. Always ready.

Alastor Kaine entered the basement with deliberate, measured steps, his polished shoes clicking against the cold steel floor. He exhaled softly, almost in disappointment, and without a word, crossed the room to a sleek, antique record player positioned atop a metal table. With the same precision he applied to everything in his life, he lifted the delicate needle, placing it against the spinning vinyl. A gentle static crackled before the sound of an old symphony filled the space‚Äî**Mozart. Requiem.**

The mournful choral notes swelled, folding into the air like a final prayer for the damned.

Kaine turned back to the prisoners, his expression unreadable, his hands clasped behind his back.

‚ÄúYou should feel honored,‚Äù Kaine said, his voice calm, calculated. ‚ÄúYour knowledge, your skills, your very essence‚Ä¶ will not be lost. It will be preserved, elevated, given new life where it truly matters.‚Äù

The music swelled behind his words, an eerie contrast to the quiet, muffled terror thickening the room.

One of the prisoners trembled against their restraints, a whimper barely escaping their lips. Kaine tilted his head slightly, as if listening to the sound beneath the music‚Äîthe rise and fall of shallow breaths, the unspoken pleas, the fragile hope that maybe, just maybe, someone would come to stop this.

No one would.

Kaine sighed, stepping forward. ‚ÄúShall we begin?‚Äù

A muffled whimper came from a young woman near the back, a painter with ink-stained fingers and panic in her dark eyes. She had been silent up until now, watching, waiting. But the weight of what was about to happen finally broke her.

Kaine's gaze slid toward her, almost amused. ""You have a gift, Miss Caulfield. Would you rather it die with you? Or would you rather it serve something greater? Someone greater?""

""You're stealing our minds,"" she spat, her voice raw, thick with fury and terror. ""You‚Äôre nothing but a parasite.""

Kaine tilted his head, considering her words like one might consider a minor inconvenience. ""Parasite? No. Evolution. The weak fade. The strong endure. And I‚Ä¶ I become.""

He turned back toward the machine, fingers gliding over the console. The man in the chair stiffened further, his breath quickening as the restraints clicked tighter around his wrists.

Kaine reached for the controls, his fingers effortlessly activating the sequence. The machine hummed as the man in the machine jerked violently, his eyes rolling back as invisible threads of memory, of knowledge, of identity itself, were pulled from his mind and funneled into the vast digital archive owned by Alastor Kaine. Within seconds, his breathing slowed. His muscles slackened. And then‚Ä¶ nothing.

He was still alive, still conscious. But empty. His gaze drifted across the room, unfocused, hollow. A blank slate.

Kaine inhaled slowly, closing his eyes as if savoring the moment. ""Excellent."" His voice was soft, almost reverent. He turned back to the captives. ""Next.""

A murmur of panic spread through the remaining captives. One of the martial artists‚Äîa man with scars on his knuckles and defiance in his stare‚Äîbegan struggling against his bindings. ""You're making a mistake,"" he growled. ""You take my memories, and my body will remember what I forgot. Muscle memory isn‚Äôt so easy to erase.""

Kaine‚Äôs lips curved into something resembling amusement. ""A fair point. But tell me, if you don‚Äôt know why you fight, if you don‚Äôt remember what drives you‚Äîwill your body still obey? Or will it hesitate? Will doubt creep in?""

The martial artist‚Äôs jaw clenched, but he said nothing.

Kaine took a step closer, his voice lowering to something almost conspiratorial. ""You see, I don‚Äôt need the memory of your skills. I need your instincts, your knowledge, your essence. And you‚Ä¶?"" He leaned in. ""You need to accept the inevitable‚Äîstruggle only delays the outcome.""

The martial artist bared his teeth, his muscles straining against the restraints. His voice was a low, venomous growl. ""I‚Äôd rather die on my feet than kneel to a parasite like you.""

Kaine smirked, unshaken. **""**Then consider this mercy‚ÄîI‚Äôm saving you the trouble.""

¬†

A metallic hiss filled the air as the restraints on the next chair unlatched, signaling the next extraction. Another life about to be stripped away. Another soul lost to the machine.

Kaine reached for the controls again, his fingers tapping a practiced sequence. The next captive convulsed as the machine drank deep, pulling everything that made them who they were into the cold, digital void. Their breath hitched, their body went slack, and then they were gone‚Äîalive but vacant.

Kaine sighed contentedly. ""Another mind, well harvested.""

The sound of a heavy door creaking open interrupted his moment of satisfaction. A hired thug stepped inside, dragging a struggling figure behind him. The new captive thrashed; their muffled screams barely audible through the gag tied around their mouth.

Kaine turned, his gaze settling on the newcomer with interest. ""Ah. Another donation to the cause.""

The thug smirked, shoving the captive forward onto the cold, hard floor.

Kaine clasped his hands behind his back, looking down at the trembling figure. ""Welcome.‚Äù He gestured toward the machine. ""Strap them in.""

With a slow flick of his wrist, he barely glanced at the guard. ""The used ones,"" he murmured, his tone devoid of weight or regret. ""Let the ocean take them.""

The guard nodded without hesitation, signaling for reinforcements. The remaining captives tensed, their muffled screams swallowed by the oppressive silence of the basement as they were dragged away, their fates sealed.

Kaine exhaled slowly, then turned back to the console, a satisfied smile playing at his lips. ""Now then,"" he murmured. ""Let‚Äôs continue.""

***Chapter 8: The Virus in the Machine***

Elynn Vale had never been one for heroics.

She wasn‚Äôt a rebel. She wasn‚Äôt a spy. She was a woman who had learned to survive by keeping her head down, by following the rules. By believing that what was done in the memory chambers wasn‚Äôt her responsibility‚Äîit was just business. Just a job.

And yet, here she was. Sitting in front of a sleek corporate interface, her fingers poised over the terminal, about to commit a crime that could dismantle everything she had spent years pretending she didn‚Äôt see. Julian said she needed to prove herself but

More than that‚Äîshe needed answers.

The truth about NeuroCorp‚Äôs extractions, it all led back to the technology itself. Something wasn‚Äôt right. And Julian said the only way for the resistance plan to give back all memories to work was to find out what was buried beneath layers of encryption and corporate firewalls, so the plan was to inject a virus directly into NeuroCorp‚Äôs core.

She had memorized the sequence, practiced in her head a dozen times before stepping into the office that evening. The virus wasn‚Äôt designed to destroy‚Äîit was designed to reveal. A sleeper code that would burrow into the system, unspooling hidden files, uncovering what even the highest security clearances weren‚Äôt meant to access.

She had five minutes. Maybe less.

The office was nearly empty this late at night. Most of the memory technicians had gone home. Security patrols were light‚Äîmost of them stationed in the lower levels where the high-profile transfers took place. But even so, her heart pounded as she inserted the small, unmarked drive into the console.

A simple keystroke. One press of her finger, and the virus would be inside NeuroCorp‚Äôs most guarded digital vault.

Her throat was dry. Her pulse was too fast.

*What the hell am I doing?*

Elynn wasn‚Äôt sure when she had crossed the line from detached observer to willing accomplice. Maybe it had been the moment she saw Donovan Price‚Äôs empty eyes after his last extraction. Maybe it had been the first time she looked at Julian Cross and felt something stir‚Äîsomething dangerously close to recognition. Maybe it was the aching feeling that had haunted her.

None of it mattered now. She had already made her choice.

Her fingers hovered over the command key.

*One press. One second. Do it.*

She exhaled sharply and hit enter.

A small progress bar blinked onto the screen. **Upload in progress‚Ä¶ 3%**

The drive hummed softly. Data streams flickered, invisible hands prying open doors that were never meant to be touched. Elynn watched as the system gave no indication of the intrusion‚Äîno alarms, no security overrides. Julian had said the virus would be discreet, that it would slip in unnoticed.

Still, she couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling of being watched.

She shifted in her chair, fingers drumming against the desk as the progress bar climbed higher. **45%‚Ä¶ 67%‚Ä¶ 82%‚Ä¶** Almost there.

And then‚Äî

‚ÄúWorking late, Elynn?‚Äù

The voice was smooth. Polished. Unshaken.

Alastor Kaine.

A chill laced down her spine, but she didn‚Äôt let it show. Slowly, methodically, she minimized the terminal screen, schooling her expression into something neutral before turning toward him.

Kaine moved to the back of the office, hands in his pockets, his posture effortless but deliberate. His tailored suit was crisp as always, his dark eyes unreadable. A man who had never known hesitation, only certainty.

‚ÄúI thought I told you to leave early tonight,‚Äù he said casually, stepping inside.

Elynn forced a small, polite smile. ‚ÄúI had some reports to finalize. I didn‚Äôt want to fall behind.‚Äù

Kaine nodded, as if considering her words. Then, with an almost imperceptible glance, his gaze flicked to the console behind her.

*The drive is still plugged in.*

Elynn‚Äôs breath remained steady, but she could feel the burn of adrenaline creeping into her veins.

‚ÄúI appreciate the dedication,‚Äù Kaine said, stepping closer, slowly and deliberately. ‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt like loose ends, Elynn.‚Äù

She swallowed, tilting her head slightly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure what you mean.‚Äù

Kaine studied her for a long moment.

Then, without warning, he moved. He reached for the console.

Elynn‚Äôs stomach clenched. She couldn‚Äôt stop him. She couldn‚Äôt yank the drive without making it obvious. She had seconds before he saw the unauthorized process running in the background.

So, she did the only thing she could do.

She knocked over her coffee.

The cup hit the edge of the desk, dark liquid spilling in a chaotic splash over the keyboard and console.

Kaine cursed, stepping back instinctively as the coffee seeped into the crevices of the device. Elynn lunged for a napkin, frantically dabbing at the mess, muttering apologies even as she discreetly yanked the drive from the port and slipped it into her sleeve.

Kaine exhaled sharply, his gaze flicking between her and the console. Something darkened in his expression‚Äîan unease, a growing suspicion. But he said nothing. Not yet.

‚ÄúYou seem nervous, Elynn,‚Äù he murmured.

She forced a breathless chuckle. ‚ÄúSpilling coffee on company property? Yeah, that‚Äôll do it.‚Äù

Kaine didn‚Äôt look convinced. He stared at her for another agonizing moment before nodding toward the soaked keyboard. ‚ÄúHave IT replace that in the morning.‚Äù

Elynn nodded, keeping her breath even. ‚ÄúOf course, sir.‚Äù

Kaine didn‚Äôt turn immediately. He lingered, his sharp gaze sweeping over the desk, the console, then finally back to her. A long, calculated pause.

Then, finally‚Äî

‚ÄúGet some rest, Elynn,‚Äù he said, his voice deceptively smooth. ‚ÄúTomorrow‚Äôs an important day.‚Äù

She watched as he left, the door closing behind him with a soft but final click.

The moment he was gone, Elynn let out a slow, controlled breath. She pressed her sleeve tighter around her wrist, feeling the small shape of the drive hidden against her skin.

She had done it.

The virus was in.

But as she gathered her things and walked out of the office, she knew one thing for certain‚ÄîKaine wasn‚Äôt convinced.

And he would be watching her. Closely.

# Chapter 9: Broken Mirrors

The underground hideout buzzed with nervous energy, the air thick with the scent of damp concrete, old wires, and stale coffee. Overhead bulbs flickered intermittently, casting jittery shadows against the walls lined with monitors, cables, and hastily pinned blueprints. Unlike the sterile precision of NeuroCorp‚Äôs corporate offices, this place was alive with urgency‚Äîthe quiet hum of rebellion.

Elynn stepped inside, Julian beside her. The faces that turned toward her were wary but hopeful. Trust was fragile here. It had to be earned.

An older woman with steel-gray hair and sharp eyes stepped forward. ‚ÄúYou made it.‚Äù

Elynn nodded. ‚ÄúThe virus is in.‚Äù

A ripple of relief passed through the group. The youngest hacker among them, a wiry woman with dark circles under her eyes, leaned over a nearby monitor. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in their vaults now, decrypting layer by layer. We‚Äôve uncovered thousands of transaction records‚Äîstolen memories, illegal extractions, classified high-profile erasures. But‚Ä¶‚Äù Her fingers hesitated on the keyboard. When looking for the source of the technology ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something we can‚Äôt break through. It‚Äôs like a separate vault inside the vault. Top-tier encryption.‚Äù

Julian frowned. ‚ÄúNeuroCorp‚Äôs highest security clearance?‚Äù

‚ÄúWorse,‚Äù the hacker muttered. ‚ÄúThis encryption isn‚Äôt just layered. It‚Äôs adaptive. The moment we get close, the system shifts. It‚Äôs not protecting files. It‚Äôs fighting back.‚Äù

A chill ran through Elynn. ‚ÄúThen we need more power.‚Äù

Julian inhaled deeply, his fingers flexing at his sides. ‚ÄúBefore we go any further, there‚Äôs something you need to know.‚Äù

The room fell silent. Elynn turned toward him, her gut tightening at his tone. He wasn‚Äôt just making a tactical observation. He was about to confess something.

‚ÄúWe restored my memories,‚Äù Julian admitted, his voice low, edged with something she couldn‚Äôt quite place‚Äîregret? Guilt? ‚ÄúNot all of them, not perfectly. The process is slow. One person at a time. But I remember now.‚Äù

Elynn‚Äôs heart pounded. ‚ÄúYou restored them? How?‚Äù

A younger man near the monitors, Lucian, answered. ‚ÄúA makeshift interface. We built a prototype using a modified transfer chamber and a quantum computer. We adapted NeuroCorp‚Äôs extraction tech. The process takes time. It‚Äôs not perfect, but it works.‚Äù

Julian rubbed his temples, exhaling. ‚ÄúIt took weeks for mine to fully settle. The machine pulls what was erased from the neural pathways, but the brain resists. Some memories return like flashes; others take longer. Some might never come back at all.‚Äù

Elynn stared at him, processing. ‚ÄúAnd you didn‚Äôt tell me.‚Äù

Julian‚Äôs jaw tightened. ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt. Not until I was sure of who I was again.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd who are you?‚Äù Elynn challenged.

Julian‚Äôs expression was tense, his hands pressed against the edge of the table as if bracing himself for what he was about to say. Elynn could feel it‚Äîthe weight of something deeper, something unsaid between them.

‚ÄúI remember,‚Äù he said, voice low, measured. ‚ÄúNot everything. But enough.‚Äù

Elynn swallowed, her pulse quickening. ‚ÄúEnough about what?‚Äù

Julian exhaled, dragging a hand through his hair. ‚ÄúAbout us. About what happened before NeuroCorp wiped me.‚Äù

She blinked, her mind stuttering to process his words. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean‚Ä¶ us?‚Äù

Julian looked at her then, really looked at her, his dark eyes searching her face like he was trying to find the parts of her that were missing. ‚ÄúElynn, we weren‚Äôt just coworkers.‚Äù

A strange, uneasy feeling crawled through her chest. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúWe were lovers.‚Äù

The words hit like a pulse of electricity, sharp and disorienting. Elynn‚Äôs breath caught. Her fingers curled into her sleeves.

No. That couldn‚Äôt be true. She would have remembered‚Äîwouldn‚Äôt she?

But then, why did her stomach twist in a way she couldn‚Äôt name? Why did something deep inside her pull toward him, a gravitational force she didn‚Äôt understand?

Julian continued before she could respond. ‚ÄúNeuroCorp didn‚Äôt know. We kept it quiet. We had to. But that‚Äôs not why I was erased.‚Äù

Elynn forced herself to speak, her voice coming out smaller than she wanted. ‚ÄúThen why?‚Äù

He hesitated. Then, his jaw tightened, and he leaned forward, lowering his voice. ‚ÄúBecause I saw something I wasn‚Äôt supposed to.‚Äù

The room around them felt suddenly smaller, the dim glow of the monitors casting jagged shadows on the walls.

Julian‚Äôs fingers tapped lightly against the table, as if his body was restless, remembering. ‚ÄúI stumbled onto a memory file‚Äîone that wasn‚Äôt supposed to exist. A record of a high-clearance extraction, buried deep in the system.‚Äù

Elynn stiffened. ‚ÄúThe CEO‚Äôs files?‚Äù

Julian nodded. ‚ÄúAlastor Kaine doesn‚Äôt just erase criminals, Elynn. He collects people. The most brilliant minds, the most dangerous skills‚Äîscientists, strategists, artists, martial experts. He doesn‚Äôt erase them to protect society. He erases them to steal their abilities. To use them.‚Äù

Elynn‚Äôs stomach twisted. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre saying he‚Äîwhat? Keeps their knowledge? Stores their skills for himself?‚Äù

Julian‚Äôs throat worked as he swallowed. ‚ÄúNo. He transfers them. Into himself.‚Äù

Silence stretched between them, thick, suffocating.

Elynn shook her head, her mind resisting the idea.

Julian‚Äôs voice was grave. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve seen what the extraction process does. You know how deeply memories are embedded in who we are. Kaine isn‚Äôt just wiping people. He‚Äôs taking them. Piece by piece.‚Äù

Elynn felt the air leave her lungs.

It wasn‚Äôt just an erasure. It was theft. A man building himself from the stolen memories of others.

She pressed her palms against her temples, trying to focus. ‚ÄúAnd you found proof?‚Äù

Julian nodded. ‚ÄúAnd I showed you.‚Äù

Elynn froze.

Her pulse pounded in her ears. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶‚Äù Her voice trailed off.

She didn‚Äôt remember that. She didn‚Äôt remember any of it.

Julian‚Äôs expression darkened. ‚ÄúWe decided to dig deeper. To access Kaine‚Äôs restricted files. We needed undeniable proof of what he was doing. We got close, Elynn. Too close.‚Äù

His fingers clenched against the table, his breath coming heavier now, like the memories were crashing back into him with full force. ‚ÄúSecurity caught us before we could get out. Kaine was waiting. He didn‚Äôt ask questions. Didn‚Äôt hesitate.‚Äù

Elynn felt cold, even as her heart pounded.

‚ÄúHe wiped us,‚Äù Julian murmured, his voice thick with something between rage and regret. ‚ÄúHe erased everything. Who I was, what I knew, what we meant to each other.‚Äù His jaw clenched. ‚ÄúAnd then, he made a choice.‚Äù

Elynn stared at him, feeling the answer coming before he even spoke it.

‚ÄúHe kept you.‚Äù Julian‚Äôs voice was quiet, but it carried the weight of a past she couldn‚Äôt remember. ‚ÄúHe let me go.‚Äù

Her chest tightened. The implications of that‚Äîof Kaine deciding she was useful enough to keep, of wiping Julian and casting him aside‚Äîmade her stomach churn.

Julian exhaled, leaning back, his fingers pressing into his temples. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know any of this until the nightmares started. Flashes of something I couldn‚Äôt explain‚Äîfaces, moments, sounds. Then the resistance found me. They had a way to bring some of it back. And when they did‚Ä¶ I started to remember you.‚Äù

Elynn‚Äôs breath came short and uneven.

She didn‚Äôt know what was more terrifying‚Äîthe fact that she couldn‚Äôt remember him, or the fact that she wanted to.

Julian‚Äôs eyes were heavy with something raw. ‚ÄúElynn‚Ä¶ you were everything to me. And we tried to stop this together.‚Äù He swallowed. ‚ÄúBut Kaine stole that from us.‚Äù

She felt like the floor beneath her was tilting, like the entire reality she had accepted was built on something fragile and false.

She had spent years thinking she was just another cog in the machine.

But she had already tried to break it once.

And she had lost everything for it.

Her hands trembled as she pressed them against the table.

Julian watched her carefully. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to trust me. But I‚Äôm not here to lie to you. And I need to know‚Äî‚Äù He hesitated, then exhaled. ‚ÄúAre you with me? Will you help me finish what we started?‚Äù

Elynn didn‚Äôt answer right away.

Because this wasn‚Äôt just about Julian.

This was about herself.

About everything she had lost.

Everything that had been taken from her.

Her voice was quiet, but certain. ‚ÄúI want my memories back.‚Äù

¬†

Another beat of silence, then Lena cleared her throat. ‚ÄúThe QPU needs a few more hours to calibrate. Once it‚Äôs up, we go all in. No half-measures. If we do this, there‚Äôs no turning back.‚Äù

Elynn turned toward Julian. ‚ÄúBefore we do this, we need to talk about what happens after.‚Äù

His gaze sharpened. ""You mean the risks?""

She nodded. ""Restoring stolen memories isn‚Äôt just about giving people their lives back. What about the ones who chose to sell theirs? We‚Äôre undoing something they agreed to.""

Julian exhaled. ""They never should have been able to sell them in the first place.""

¬†

Lucian pushed off the wall, his tone firm. ‚ÄúA person shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to sell their past any more than they can sell their soul. It‚Äôs not a commodity. It‚Äôs who you are. The second NeuroCorp turned memories into currency, they crossed a line that can‚Äôt be walked back.‚Äù

Elynn‚Äôs fingers tightened. ‚ÄúSo, we force people to remember?‚Äù

Julian shook his head. ""We‚Äôre not forcing anything. We‚Äôre restoring what was stolen. And if some of them don‚Äôt want it?"" He hesitated, but his voice was unwavering. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll learn to live with it. We all do.‚Äù

Lena drummed her fingers against the desk. ""This is bigger than just giving people their memories back. It‚Äôs about breaking the system that allowed it to happen. Once we do this, no one will ever be able to sell their past again. We rewrite the program, lock it down. No more extractions. No more transfers. No more erasing lives.""

Elynn looked around the room. ""And what about criminals?""

A heavy silence followed.

Lucian sighed. ""If they were erased, they paid their price. But if we put them back into the world with all their past crimes intact, we create chaos. Some of them will pick up right where they left off.""

Julian exhaled, rubbing his jaw. ""Then we don‚Äôt let them.""

Lena turned, raising a brow. ""You‚Äôre saying we erase them again?""

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Julian‚Äôs voice was calm, steady. ""We make sure they never get the chance. When we control the system. We decide who remembers.""

Elynn stared at him. ""That makes us no better than them.""

Julian held her gaze. ""No, it makes us responsible. If we don‚Äôt do it, who will?""

The room was silent again. This was the weight of their decision. This wasn‚Äôt about right or wrong‚Äîit was about what could be undone and what couldn‚Äôt.

Finally, Elynn exhaled. ‚ÄúWe do it. We restore what was taken. And we make sure no one ever has to go through this again.‚Äù

Julian nodded. ""Then we finish this.""

¬†

Lena turned back to the screen, fingers flying over the keyboard. ‚ÄúAlright. We will go live with the quantum computer in one week. When we flip the switch, it‚Äôs over. No one sells their past ever again.‚Äù

Elynn‚Äôs gaze snapped to her. *The quantum computer.* The words settled uneasily in her mind. ‚ÄúYou keep mentioning it, but you never said where it came from. Who built it?‚Äù

Lena hesitated. Julian and Lucian exchanged a brief look‚Äîtoo quick, too knowing.

‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt built by *us*,‚Äù Julian admitted. His voice carried a weight she didn‚Äôt like. ‚ÄúIt was *given* to us.‚Äù

Elynn frowned. ‚ÄúBy who?‚Äù

Lena exhaled, leaning back in her chair. ‚ÄúA benefactor. Someone with deep pockets and even deeper secrets.‚Äù

Julian ran a hand through his hair. ‚ÄúThe name we got was *Dorian Blackwell*‚Äîif that‚Äôs even real. Old money, the kind that doesn‚Äôt show up in history books, the kind that owns history itself. No digital footprint, no public record, just whispers in the right circles. He found us, not the other way around.‚Äù

Elynn felt her pulse quicken. ‚ÄúAnd you just *trusted* him?‚Äù

‚ÄúTrust?‚Äù Lena scoffed. ‚ÄúNo. But when someone hands you a machine that can rewrite reality and asks for nothing in return, you *listen*.‚Äù

Elynn swallowed. ‚ÄúAnd what does *he* get out of this?‚Äù

Lucian shook his head. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what we‚Äôre afraid to find out.‚Äù

¬†

Elynn felt a strange sense of finality settle over her, like the closing of a book she had spent years pretending she wasn‚Äôt trapped inside. For so long, she had existed in the gray‚Äîdrifting between obedience and denial, convincing herself that survival was the same as living. She had told herself she had no choice, that the machine was too big, the system too powerful, that she was just one cog turning in an endless cycle.

But now, for the first time, she had stopped turning.

This was a choice. Her choice. And whether it led to salvation or ruin, whether it unraveled everything or reshaped the world, she knew one thing with absolute certainty.

For the first time in years, she wasn‚Äôt just following orders.

She was breaking them.

And it felt right.

***Chapter 10: Shadows of Yesterday***

Liam Carter didn‚Äôt remember falling asleep. One moment, he had been pacing his apartment, the encounter with his himself‚Äîhis impossible doppelg√§nger‚Äîstill fresh in his mind. The next, he was gasping awake, drenched in sweat, the sharp scent of blood and ozone filling his nostrils.

His heart pounded as he sat up, the darkness pressing against him like a living thing. He knew this feeling. The same creeping unease, the same vertigo that made the world tilt sideways. Another episode.

He wasn‚Äôt alone.

A figure stood at the foot of his bed.

Liam‚Äôs breath caught, a paralyzing fear snaking through his chest. The man‚Äîno, the thing‚Äîwas barely visible in the dim glow from the city lights outside. But Liam knew. He recognized the broad shoulders, the shadowed angles of a face identical to his own.

A reflection where there was no mirror.

‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù Liam‚Äôs voice cracked, raw with panic.

The figure didn‚Äôt move. It just stared. Eyes too dark, too deep‚Äîpools of something Liam couldn‚Äôt name. Not quite human.

‚ÄúI said‚Äîwho the hell are you?‚Äù

Still, silence. The air in the room grew thick, pressing against his chest like a weight. A low ringing filled his ears, distant and growing, as if something was burrowing into his skull.

Then, the figure smiled. It was a slow, deliberate thing, chilling in its familiarity. And when it finally spoke, its voice wasn‚Äôt Liam‚Äôs‚Äîbut it was close. Twisted. Hollow.

‚ÄúYou know me.‚Äù

Liam‚Äôs vision swam. His fingers dug into the sheets, grounding himself. This wasn‚Äôt real. This couldn‚Äôt be real. He forced himself to blink, to breathe, to reach for something tangible, something solid. But the moment he did‚Äî

The figure lunged.

Liam‚Äôs body reacted before his mind could catch up. He scrambled out of bed, crashing into the nightstand as he staggered back. The lamp toppled, shattering against the floor, sending jagged shards skidding across the wood. He didn‚Äôt stop. Couldn‚Äôt stop. He ran.

Out the door. Down the hallway. The walls seemed to narrow around him, warping with each step. His breath came in ragged gasps as he threw himself down the stairwell, bare feet slamming against cold concrete. The city roared outside, neon streaking past his vision as he burst onto the street.

But the figure‚Äîhis double‚Äîwas gone.

Liam spun, chest heaving, searching. The alleyways, the sidewalks, the moving crowd. No sign of it. Just the usual late-night wanderers, the hum of distant engines, the flickering glow of neon signs advertising a thousand different escapes.

Nothing. No one.

His pulse was a hammer against his ribs. He pressed a shaking hand to his forehead, his skin clammy with sweat.

Not again. Not like this.

This wasn‚Äôt the first time. The episodes were getting worse. More vivid. More real. It wasn‚Äôt just shadows in his periphery anymore‚Äîit was voices, faces, hands reaching for him from the corners of his mind.

His own face staring back at him, unblinking.

A sudden, sharp pain flared behind his eyes. Liam groaned, stumbling against the wall of a closed storefront. Images flashed‚Äîmemories that weren‚Äôt his. A city street at dusk. Blood on his hands. A name he didn‚Äôt recognize, whispered in the dark.

Then‚Äînothing. The pain stopped, leaving him breathless and disoriented.

Liam clenched his jaw. He couldn‚Äôt keep pretending this was normal. He needed answers. Needed to know why pieces of a life he didn‚Äôt remember kept bleeding into his own.

And he needed to find the man who had stolen his reflection.

Pushing off the wall, Liam steadied himself. He had no plan. No leads. Only one certainty.

The past he had forgotten wasn‚Äôt staying buried.

And whatever was coming for him‚Äîit wasn‚Äôt done yet.",1,1758038016.0,u_Average_Joe3333,0,1.0,False

After a recent o-ring and gasket overhaul I noticed the La Pavoni Millennium ""Achilles Heel"", the plastic group head sleeve ""jacket"", was in poor shape after almost 19 years of daily use. When the lever began become stiff and difficult to raise again I decided to bite the bullet and order the stainless steel version sold by Coffee-Sensor. I also replaced the piston as some threads were stripped and shavings were coming off so the adjustment and lock nut were difficult to loosen/fasten. And to top it off I got the silicone piston gaskets. 

In a word, WOW. 

Not only is this precision part beautiful, it functions beautifully. Especially with the silicone gaskets. 

Word to the wise, though, the primary reason my piston was difficult to raise, in addition to the aged and dirty plastic sleeve, was I had used too much grease on the previous overhaul. The grease bonded to coffee oils and created a sticky sludge that had to be cleaned off everything including the shower screen as some holes were actually blocked by the sludge. So, grease lightly. 

The first test shot I pulled was a perfect 1-2 ratio (15g grounds/30g shot) Beautiful crema. 

Now my 2006 Europiccola is all metal/rubber and feels and functions like a pistol.

1nilaok,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1nilaok/something_in_the_woods_copies_our_campfire_songs/,Something in the Woods Copies Our Campfire Songs,"I should have known something was wrong when Jake stopped singing along.

We'd been going to Camp Wildwood for three summers straight‚Äîme, Jake, Sarah, and Tommy. It wasn't anything fancy, just a patch of state forest up north where you could pitch a tent for twenty bucks a night. No cell service, no bathroom facilities, just you and the woods for miles in every direction. We loved it.

This was supposed to be our last trip before college scattered us across the country. Sarah had gotten into some fancy school in California, Tommy was heading to trade school, and Jake and I were staying local but figured things would never be quite the same. So we'd planned this final weekend, packed our usual supplies, and driven the four hours to our favorite spot beside Crystal Lake.

The first night went perfectly. We'd set up camp in our usual clearing, about fifty yards back from the water. Sarah had brought her guitar like always, and after we'd gotten a good fire going, she started playing the songs we'd been singing together for years. ""Country Roads,"" ""Sweet Caroline,"" all the classics that sound better when you're slightly off-key and surrounded by friends.

That's when I first heard it.

Just as Sarah finished the chorus of ""Country Roads,"" I swear I heard someone else singing the last line from somewhere in the trees behind us. The voice was faint, maybe carried on the wind, but it was definitely there. I looked around at the others, but they were already launching into the next verse, laughing at Tommy's attempt at harmonizing.

""Did you guys hear that?"" I asked during a break between songs.

""Hear what?"" Sarah adjusted her grip on the guitar neck.

""Someone singing. From the woods.""

Jake laughed. ""Probably just an echo off the lake, man. Sound does weird things out here.""

I nodded, but I wasn't convinced. The voice had sounded too clear, too deliberate to be an echo. Still, I didn't want to kill the mood, so I let it go.

The second night, it happened again.

We were sitting around the fire, and Sarah had just finished playing ""Puff the Magic Dragon""‚Äîa song that always made us feel like kids again, even though we were all eighteen. As the last chord faded, I heard it again: a voice from the darkness, singing the final line word for word.

This time, Jake heard it too. He sat up straighter, his head tilted toward the trees.

""What was that?"" he asked.

""I told you guys yesterday,"" I said. ""There's someone out there.""

""It's probably just another campsite,"" Sarah said, though she sounded less certain than the night before. ""Sound carries weird in the forest.""

We sat in silence for a moment, listening. The usual night sounds surrounded us‚Äîcrickets, the distant hoot of an owl, wind rustling through leaves. But no voices, no other campers.

Tommy grabbed a flashlight and swept it across the tree line. The beam illuminated nothing but trunks and undergrowth, shadows dancing as the light moved.

""Maybe we should check the camp registry when we head out,"" Jake suggested. ""See if there are other people nearby.""

But I'd already seen the registry when we signed in. We were the only ones registered for this section of the forest.

The third night changed everything.

Sarah had just started playing ""House of the Rising Sun""‚Äîa newer addition to our campfire repertoire that she'd been practicing all summer. She was only halfway through the first verse when the voice joined in.

This time, it wasn't singing the words we'd already finished. It was harmonizing with Sarah in real time, note for note, word for word. The voice came from multiple directions now, as if whatever was out there had moved around our camp while singing.

Sarah's fingers froze on the strings. The guitar fell silent, but the voice in the woods continued singing for another few seconds before it, too, stopped.

The silence that followed felt suffocating.

""That's not an echo,"" Tommy whispered.

Jake stood up so fast he knocked over his camp chair. ""We need to leave. Right now.""

""Don't be ridiculous,"" Sarah said, but her voice was shaking. ""It's probably just‚Äî""

""Just what?"" Jake's voice cracked. ""Just some psycho who's been watching us for three days? Learning our songs?""

I wanted to argue, but the fear in Jake's voice matched what I was feeling. This wasn't some innocent camper at a distant site. This was something else, something that had been observing us, studying us.

""Let's just pack up in the morning,"" I said, trying to be the voice of reason. ""We'll leave first thing.""

But as I said it, the voice started up again. This time it wasn't singing‚Äîit was talking. Repeating our conversation back to us in a voice that sounded almost like mine, but not quite right.

""Let's just pack up in the morning. We'll leave first thing.""

Then it repeated Sarah's words: ""It's probably just‚Äî""

Then Tommy's: *""That's not an echo.""

Each phrase came from a different spot in the darkness, as if multiple people were positioned around our camp, throwing our own words back at us.

Jake grabbed the biggest flashlight we had and started walking toward the trees. ""Show yourself!"" he shouted. ""What do you want?""

I caught his arm. ""Don't. Just don't.""

But it was too late. The voice responded, using Jake's own words:  ""Show yourself! What do you want?""

But this time, it wasn't coming from the woods. It was coming from behind us, from the direction of our tents.

We spun around, flashlight beams cutting through the darkness. Nothing. But as we stood there, breathing hard and trying to make sense of what was happening, we heard it again.

Singing.

It was ""Country Roads,"" the first song Sarah had played three nights ago. But now there were four voices singing it, each one slightly different, each one an imperfect copy of one of ours. My voice, Jake's voice, Sarah's voice, Tommy's voice‚Äîall singing together from somewhere in the darkness beyond our fire's reach.

The harmony was beautiful and terrifying.

We didn't sleep that night. We sat back-to-back around the dying fire, flashlights in hand, listening to our own voices singing our favorite songs back to us from the woods. Sometimes the singing would stop, and we'd hear our conversations from earlier in the weekend being replayed‚Äîdiscussions about college, inside jokes, even private moments when we thought no one else was listening.

When dawn finally came, we packed our gear in record time. Nobody talked about what had happened. We just wanted to get out of there.

It wasn't until we were loading the car that I realized Jake hadn't said a word all morning. He'd helped pack, nodded when we asked him questions, but he hadn't actually spoken since the night before.

""You okay, man?"" I asked him as we secured the tent to the roof rack.

He looked at me, opened his mouth as if to speak, then closed it again. He tried a second time, and when words finally came out, they weren't in his voice.

They were in mine.

""You okay, man?"" he said, using my exact intonation, my exact tone.

That was six months ago. We never talked about what happened at Camp Wildwood, not once. Sarah and Tommy went off to their schools, and Jake and I started at the local community college. Everything seemed normal.

Except Jake never speaks in his own voice anymore.

At first, I thought maybe I was imagining it. But over time, I've realized that every word Jake says is something one of us said during those three days in the woods. He speaks using our voices, our inflections, our words‚Äîlike he's some kind of recording device playing back conversations from that weekend.

The others don't seem to notice. When Jake talks, they respond normally, as if nothing's wrong. But I hear it. I hear Sarah's voice coming out of his mouth when he orders coffee. I hear Tommy's laugh when Jake thinks something's funny. I hear my own voice when he's trying to be serious.

And sometimes, late at night when I'm trying to fall asleep, I swear I can hear singing outside my window. Four voices harmonizing to songs we used to sing around the campfire, getting more perfect each time.

I think something came back with us from those woods. Something that's still learning, still copying, still watching.

And I'm starting to wonder if Jake is the only one it took.



Have you ever noticed yourself saying things you don't remember deciding to say?

*A Novel by Nathaniel*



***Chapter 1: The Price of a Crime***

Cormac sat rigid in the transfer chamber, his wrists bound to the steel arms of the chair, his breathing shallow. The artificial glow of the room cast stark shadows against his face, illuminating the beads of sweat gathering at his temple. The scent of sterile metal filled the air, cold and impersonal. The hum of the scanner above him was a constant reminder that his past, the very essence of his being, was no longer his own.

Elynn Vale stood before him, fingers hovering over the console. Unlike the others who had sat in this chair‚Äîdesperate, willing‚ÄîCormac had no choice. He was not here to sell his past for survival. He was here because the state had deemed his memories unfit for him to keep.

His file flickered across her interface:

**Cormac ‚Äì Criminal Class 3**

**Conviction: First-degree murder**

**Memory Sentence: Full Removal**

A slow, deliberate exhale left Elynn‚Äôs lips. She had performed countless transfers. Most were voluntary. The poor sold their pasts to escape debt, sacrificing pieces of themselves for another day of existence. But the ones like Cormac? The prisoners? The dangerous ones? Their extractions were different.

There would be no appeals, no last-minute negotiations. His past would be erased, it was marked as contraband‚Äîtoo violent, too raw, too dangerous to remain.

‚ÄúIs this what justice looks like now?‚Äù Cormac‚Äôs voice was hoarse, but steady. His dark eyes fixed on Elynn, searching for something‚Äîanger, guilt, hesitation. He found none.

She didn‚Äôt respond. The system did not require her sympathy. It required compliance.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to do this,‚Äù he continued, his fingers clenching against the armrest. ‚ÄúYou know that, right? Just because they tell you something is right doesn‚Äôt mean it is.‚Äù

Elynn‚Äôs jaw tightened, but she forced herself to remain impassive. ‚ÄúYour sentence was passed by the state tribunal. You were found guilty.‚Äù

‚ÄúI was found inconvenient,‚Äù he spat. ‚ÄúI know things. I remember things they don‚Äôt want me to. And now, I won‚Äôt even have the luxury of knowing what they took.‚Äù

That, at least, was true.

Unlike those who willingly sold their pasts, prisoners never retained an awareness of what had been erased. The process was absolute, methodical. His crime, his motivations, his very identity‚Äîwiped clean. There would be nothing left of Cormac Thorne. Only a hollow shell with no past to anchor him, no regrets to weigh him down.

He would not mourn what he could not remember.

‚ÄúDo you even care what I did?‚Äù he pressed, his voice lower now. ‚ÄúOr what they say I did?‚Äù

Elynn hesitated for the first time. It was a dangerous pause, the kind that left room for doubt. The kind that could get her noticed. She forced herself to look at the data on the screen, the cold, indisputable record of his crime. A woman‚Äôs name. A crime scene. Proof beyond reasonable doubt.

But proof was a flexible thing, wasn‚Äôt it?

She didn‚Äôt ask questions. It wasn‚Äôt her job to.

‚ÄúThe procedure is final,‚Äù she said, her voice colder than she felt. ‚ÄúOnce the extraction begins, you will be processed for societal reintegration.‚Äù

Cormac‚Äôs lips twisted into something like a smirk. ‚ÄúYou mean I‚Äôll be nothing. Another blank slate walking around, smiling like a good citizen. Like a trained dog that forgot it used to bite.‚Äù

A hollow silence stretched between them.

Elynn‚Äôs fingers hovered over the console. If she hesitated too long, the system would flag the delay. Security would step in. She exhaled sharply and pressed the authorization.

The scanner descended, bathing Cormac in a sterile blue glow. A sharp, high-pitched hum filled the chamber as the extraction sequence initiated.

He twitched violently. His pupils dilated, his breath shuddered‚Äîand then, just as suddenly, his body stilled.

Elynn didn‚Äôt move, watching the monitors as the system processed his mind, fragment by fragment. The crime, the motive, the fear, the anger‚Äîevery trace of who he had been was deleted.

And then, finally, he blinked.

The anguish was gone. The defiance. The recognition.

When he looked up, there was nothing in his eyes. No past. No crime. No memories.

The door slid open, and two guards entered. One gestured for Cormac to stand. He did so without hesitation, his movements smooth, docile.

‚ÄúYou are now debt-free,‚Äù Elynn murmured, though it didn‚Äôt matter. He had lost everything.

As the guards escorted him out, Elynn turned back to her screen. The chamber door slid open again. Another prisoner stepped in, another mind about to be erased.

Her stomach churned as she processed the next file. Another extraction. Another blank slate. Another past dismantled.

Guilt could be assigned.

Memories could be erased.

But justice was neither truth nor morality‚Äîonly the illusion of balance, bought and sold like any other commodity.

¬†

***Chapter 2: Selling Yesterday***

Elynn Vale sat motionless in the dim hush of her apartment, the city‚Äôs neon glow flickering against the windowpanes like the pulse of something alive. In her hand, a drink. Untouched. It had become a habit‚Äîa hollow ritual, a way to anchor herself in a world that no longer felt entirely hers.

The apartment was compact, deliberately impersonal‚Äîa space meant for passing through, not settling in. The furniture was sparse, the walls unadorned, as if designed for someone who preferred not to leave a mark. A single, well-worn armchair sat in the center of the room, angled toward the faint glow of her phone screen. The shifting blue light flickered against the walls, casting restless shadows that made the space feel both too empty and too full at the same time.

She took a slow sip of the whiskey she wasn‚Äôt really drinking and tapped at her tablet, absently scrolling past news feeds, entertainment clips, and political scandals that would be forgotten by morning. None of it mattered. None of it felt real.

Her fingers hovered over a thumbnail:

""The Hollow World Conspiracy‚ÄîIs There a Civilization Beneath Our Feet?""

She hesitated. Then, with a flick, she selected it.

A grainy video played‚Äîa montage of ancient maps, deep cave systems, and blurry, indistinct footage of explorers standing before yawning, uncharted chasms. A narrator with a voice smooth as static spoke over the images.

*""For centuries, legends have persisted about a hidden civilization beneath the Earth. From the myths of Agartha to modern conspiracy theories, stories hint at an advanced society living beyond the reach of the surface world. Some claim it‚Äôs just folklore. Others believe powerful institutions have buried the truth.""*

Elynn exhaled, leaning back, half-listening as the video continued.

# Theories range from ancient breakaway civilizations to something‚Ä¶ less human. Strange electromagnetic anomalies have been reported near the planet‚Äôs poles, alongside inexplicable disappearances of those who venture too far into the depths. What are they hiding? And if these stories are true, why has no one ever returned with proof?

Elynn hesitated, her fingers hovering over the screen. Below the video, a **r**ecommended link flickered in the algorithm's feed, its title bold:

‚ÄúTHE HOLLOW MOON: The Lie We Were Never Meant to Question.‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt believe in myths and decided to waste time on internet theories spun from shadows. But the thought lodged in her mind like a splinter. Hidden civilizations. Lost knowledge. People erased from history**.**

She knew something about that, didn‚Äôt she?

She had spent years dismantling people‚Äôs pasts, reducing their lives to transactions. She had told herself it was just a job, that it wasn‚Äôt personal.

But what if the past wasn‚Äôt as easily erased as she thought?

What if there were pieces of it, buried deep beneath the surface, just waiting to be found?

She exhaled slowly. Tried to shake the weight pressing against her ribs. Told herself, as she always did, that she was only doing her job. That this was survival. That the system had existed long before her and would continue long after.

A lie. A well-worn one, but a lie all the same.

Lately, there had been‚Ä¶ moments.

Flashes of unease.

A name lingering on the tip of her tongue that she couldn‚Äôt place. A song playing in a caf√© that made her stomach twist with something close to nostalgia, but for what, she didn‚Äôt know. A face in a crowd that sent a jolt through her chest like she had seen them before‚Äîhad known them‚Äîbut when she tried to place it, there was nothing.

She hadn‚Äôt sold her memories. She would remember if she had. Right?

But what if it hadn‚Äôt been voluntary?

What if, at some point, she had sat in one of those extraction chambers? What if someone had decided that something inside her‚Äîsome memory, some truth‚Äîwas better left erased?

NeuroCorp held the records of every sanctioned transaction. Every transfer, every deletion. But not every extraction was sanctioned.

She had seen what happened when people were deemed inconvenient. When justice became nothing more than a transaction, another line item in a corporate ledger.

She set the glass down, rubbing her temple.

Today had been different. Today, something had shifted.

Cormac Thorne‚Äôs empty eyes haunted her. Not because they were unique, but because they weren‚Äôt. She had seen that same absence before‚Äîin the reflections of countless others who had sat in that chair, in the blank stares of the forgotten.

And perhaps, once, in herself.

Her fingers moved absently over her screen, scrolling through the curated noise of social feeds, through artificial moments designed for validation rather than connection. And then‚Äî

She stopped.

A profile. A man.

There was an undeniable gravity to him, a pull that unsettled her pulse, as if her body recognized something her mind had forgotten

His name‚ÄîJulian Cross‚Äîmeant nothing.

But his face‚Äî

The sharp cut of his jaw, the way the light caught in his eyes‚Äîit was a ghost of familiarity, elusive yet insistent, a memory lingering just beyond the edges of recognition.

Her pulse quickened as she skimmed through his posts. An artist. His feed was a patchwork of sketches‚Äîcity streets, fractured reflections, half-formed portraits that seemed to capture something just beneath the surface. His words were careful, edged with a quiet sorrow. A man who had lost something he could not name.

Her fingers hovered over the message icon, an inexplicable tension coiling in her chest. Before she could overthink it, a new message appeared.

**Do we know each other?**

She hesitated. Then‚Äî

**I don‚Äôt think so. But‚Ä¶ I feel like I should.**

A slow, involuntary shiver ran down her spine.

**Same.**

The words sat between them, weightless yet suffocating. Elynn stared at the screen, scrolling, searching‚Äîchasing a reason for the quiet unease threading through her veins. Then she found it.

An old post, nearly forgotten beneath years of updates.

Started over today**.**

A caption beneath a blurred photo of a city skyline.

Her breath hitched.

She turned off the screen, the glow vanishing into the darkness of her apartment, but the feeling lingered‚Äîan echo of something lost.

She had spent years dismantling the past, reducing lives to transactions, convincing herself it was just business.

But now she wondered‚Äîhow many were out there, reaching into the digital void for a memory that no longer existed?

And worse‚Äîhow many had once reached for her?

¬†

***Chapter 3: Memories for Sale, Souls for Rent***

The moment the lottery numbers flashed across the screen; Gareth Lowe‚Äôs life changed. One minute, he was another face in the crowd, drowning in the endless monotony of existence; the next, he was holding a winning ticket worth more than he had ever dreamed.

It didn‚Äôt take long for him to decide what to do with his newfound wealth.

Luxury cars, high-rise apartments, all of that would come later. First, he wanted something intangible‚Äîsomething priceless. An experience he had never lived, an emotion he had never felt.

Love.

A wedding day. A wedding night. The memory of devotion, of hands trembling over lace, of whispered promises beneath dim candlelight. The sensation of being *wanted*, of being *needed*.

NeuroCorp welcomed him with open arms. They had a reputation for delivering the finest curated pasts, each one carefully selected for maximum authenticity and emotional depth. The clerk at the counter barely looked up as he made his request.

‚ÄúFull sequence?‚Äù the woman asked, her voice clipped, professional.

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù Gareth leaned forward. ‚ÄúSomething real. Passionate.‚Äù

She nodded, fingers gliding over the interface. ‚ÄúWe have several options. Are you looking for a grand ceremony? Private elopement? Exotic location?‚Äù

Gareth considered. ‚ÄúSomething intimate. I want to feel what it‚Äôs like to be *chosen*.‚Äù

After a few more rapid keystrokes, the woman‚Äôs eyes flickered to the screen. ‚ÄúWe have a premium selection available‚Äînewly acquired. A full wedding sequence, deeply emotional, highly immersive.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll take it.‚Äù He didn‚Äôt ask about the price. He didn‚Äôt care.

Elynn Vale processed the transaction without a word, though something in her gut twisted. She had seen all kinds come through these doors‚Äîthe desperate, the heartbroken, the lost. But the wealthy buyers, the ones who *chose* to partake rather than being forced into it, always unnerved her.

Still, a job was a job.

‚ÄúStep into the chamber,‚Äù she instructed.

Gareth reclined in the transfer chair, exhaling as the scanner activated. A brief moment of dizziness, then the sensation of something unraveling and reweaving within his mind. His breath hitched as the foreign memory took root, embedding itself deep, seamlessly merging with his consciousness.

He blinked.

And the world shattered.

It wasn‚Äôt a wedding.

It wasn‚Äôt love.

A dimly lit hotel room. The glow of a flickering lamp cast jagged shadows across the walls. A man stood before the mirror, adjusting his tie with slow, deliberate movements. His reflection stared back, unreadable‚Äîexcept for the darkness lingering behind his eyes, something cold, something hollow.

The air was thick with the sharp metallic tang of blood.

Behind him, two bodies lay sprawled across the bed, their forms twisted, their lives stolen in silence.

A whisper cut through the stillness, low and chilling.

""Now, that was worth remembering.""

Gareth‚Äôs breath came in ragged bursts as he was wrenched from the memory, his body convulsing as he ripped the neural interface from his temple.

‚ÄúWhat the *hell* was that?‚Äù he bellowed, stumbling out of the chair, hands shaking violently. The remnants of the memory still clawed at his mind‚Äîflashes of horror, the weight of a deed he had never committed but now *felt* as if he had.

Elynn‚Äôs stomach dropped. This wasn‚Äôt right. She had seen thousands of transfers, knew the procedure inside and out.

Gareth staggered forward, gripping the console. ‚ÄúI *paid* for love! Not‚Ä¶ *not that*!‚Äù

A technician appears and starts scanning the transaction logs, his face blanched as he muttered a curse. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs been a mix-up. That wasn‚Äôt supposed to be in the active rotation.‚Äù

Elynn turned sharply. ‚ÄúWhere did it come from?‚Äù

The technician swallowed. ‚ÄúRestricted files. High-clearance extractions.‚Äù

The air in the room seemed to tighten. Elynn's pulse quickened.

‚ÄúThe system isn‚Äôt perfect,‚Äù the technician added, his voice barely above a whisper. ‚ÄúFiles get mislabeled. Fragments bleed through. Sometimes‚Ä¶ echoes remain.‚Äù

A slow horror crept through her veins. She had heard rumors of memories of killers being bought by some very wealthy members. Some pasts were not meant to be sold. Security arrived within seconds, unsure what to do with Gareth, his screams echoing down the hallway. ‚Äú*Get it out! Get it out of my head!*‚Äù

A damage reversal was possible, but it wouldn‚Äôt be easy. Even with the right process, echoes of the experience might linger‚Äîphantom emotions, a shadow of guilt for a crime he had never committed.

The CEO had to be notified.

***Chapter 4- The Man Who Stole the World***

The CEO arrived within minutes. His presence alone sent the room into a hush. Tall, immaculately dressed, and exuding the quiet confidence of a man who had never lost a battle, Alastor Kaine strode into the chamber with the weight of authority pressing against every step. His gaze swept over the trembling Gareth, then to Elynn and the technician, before finally settling on the transfer console. His expression did not shift‚Äînot in anger, nor in concern. If anything, there was something calculating in his eyes.

‚ÄúLeave us,‚Äù Kaine commanded, his voice smooth, almost casual.

The technician hesitated. Even Elynn found herself frozen in place, her instincts screaming that something was wrong. But Kaine‚Äôs stare was absolute. The technician left and then only Elynn, Gareth, and the CEO remained.

Kaine turned his attention to Elynn, offering her a small, almost reassuring smile. ‚ÄúGo home, Elynn. This matter will be handled internally.‚Äù

Her breath caught. ‚ÄúSir, with all due respect‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll extract the memory from Mr. Lowe personally,‚Äù he said smoothly. ‚ÄúNo need for you to be involved any further.‚Äù

Elynn hesitated. Everything about this felt off, but Kaine was not a man to be questioned lightly. If she pushed too hard, she risked more than just her job. She risked answers she might not be prepared to hear.

She exhaled slowly. ‚ÄúUnderstood.‚Äù

Without another word, she turned on her heel and left. The door hissed shut behind her, sealing Gareth Lowe in with Alastor Kaine

Gareth‚Äôs hands were still trembling as he clutched his head. ‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù he choked out, his voice thick with panic. ‚ÄúGet it out. I don‚Äôt want it. I don‚Äôt want it!‚Äù

Kaine regarded him with mild curiosity, then gestured toward the chair. ‚ÄúSit.‚Äù

Gareth hesitated, but the raw terror in his eyes left no room for argument. He stumbled backward, collapsing into the seat, his chest rising and falling in ragged heaves. Kaine moved to the console, fingers gliding effortlessly over the interface as he activated the extraction sequence.

The machine hummed to life.

The extraction process was designed to be precise. Targeted. The surgical removal of unwanted memories, leaving the rest intact. But Kaine had no intention of precision.

As the neural link engaged, Gareth gasped, his back arching violently against the chair. The memory of the hotel room surged forward‚Äîblood, death, a whisper in the dark. But then, something more.

More than just that night.

Everything.

Kaine‚Äôs fingers tightened subtly over the controls, overriding the default parameters. The machine obeyed without hesitation. And just like that, Gareth Lowe‚Äôs life began to unravel.

The first kiss he had ever stolen. The laughter of his mother echoing through childhood summers. The taste of cheap whiskey at a college party. A heartbreak that had nearly undone him. The years spent clawing his way through life before the lottery had changed everything. His victories, his failures, his regrets.

All of it.

Gone.

Kaine watched, his expression never shifting, as Gareth‚Äôs body went limp, his eyes staring unfocused at the ceiling. A blank slate.

Kaine nudged Gareth‚Äôs lifeless body aside and lowered himself into the chair, his movements smooth, deliberate. With a flick of his wrist, he brought up his phone, activated the machine, and initiated the transfer. A shudder ran through him as Gareth‚Äôs memories flooded his mind‚Äîfragments of a life not his own, now seamlessly becoming part of him. His breath hitched, his fingers tightening against the armrests. Then, after a long, steadying exhale, he let go.

Relief. Completion. Control.

¬†

Alastor Kaine exhaled slowly, rolling his shoulders as if shedding the weight of something unseen. The room was silent except for the faint hum of the extraction machine winding down. Gareth Lowe slumped forward, his breathing shallow but steady. His eyes flickered open, but there was nothing behind them‚Äîno recognition, no fear, no pain.

Perfect.

Kaine adjusted his cuffs, brushing away an invisible speck of dust. He had been careful, as he always was. But mistakes happened. Loose ends appeared where there should have been none. Someone had stolen what was his, and that could not be allowed.

And now, there was no trace left. No record. No witness.

No proof.

He reached down, placing a hand on Gareth‚Äôs shoulder, more out of habit than concern. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be fine,‚Äù he murmured. ‚ÄúA new start.‚Äù

Kaine turned toward the door, already calculating his next steps. The transfer logs would be scrubbed. The technicians would ask no questions. And Gareth? He would walk out of here an empty man, a hollow vessel that the world would forget by the end of the day.

But Elynn Vale‚Ä¶

Kaine hesitated, his hand resting on the scanner as the thought settled in. She had hesitated today‚Äîquestioned, however briefly. That wasn‚Äôt like her. For years, she had been efficient, obedient, seamlessly integrated into the system.

A perfect success.

After all, he had erased her once before.

Kaine exhaled slowly, tapping his fingers against the console. He had chosen to keep her, convinced she would serve better with a carefully curated past rather than being discarded like the others. Now, he wondered if that had been a mistake.

He couldn‚Äôt afford to make mistakes.

¬†

# Chapter 5: Specters of the Past

Elynn Vale sat in the back corner of the caf√©, fingers curled around a ceramic mug, its warmth barely reaching through the chill coiling inside her. The neon haze of the city filtered through the rain-streaked windows, painting fractured reflections across the polished steel of the tabletops. She lifted the cup to her lips, the coffee lukewarm now, bitter on her tongue. She barely tasted it. Across the room, someone else sat alone, sipping absentmindedly, lost in their own thoughts. For a fleeting moment, she wondered‚Äî Had she, in another life, sat at a different table, sipping coffee with the quiet expectation of someone who never arrived‚Äîsomeone she had long since forgotten?

Julian Cross was late.

Not by much‚Äîfive minutes, maybe ten‚Äîbut enough for her to question what the hell she was doing here. Enough time for her to reconsider the message she‚Äôd sent this morning when Julian asked to meet.

A stranger‚Äôs name. A stranger‚Äôs face. And yet, the moment she had seen him, something inside her had shifted.

A quiet bell chimed, the caf√© door swinging open.

Julian.

He scanned the room with measured precision, his dark eyes moving over faces without truly seeing them‚Äîuntil he found her. His expression remained unreadable, but his presence carried a quiet gravity, a weight that made the air feel heavier. As he approached, she took in the details‚Äîhis angular jawline, the faint shadow of stubble along his sharp cheekbones, the way his dark hair fell in careless waves, a little too long, as if he had forgotten to care. His olive-toned skin was marked by faint lines at the corners of his eyes, the kind left by years of sleepless nights and unspoken regrets. His lean frame moved with deliberate control, his shoulders tense, his posture effortlessly composed yet carrying the kind of tension that suggested he was always prepared to run‚Äîor fight.

And then there was his gaze. Deep-set, watchful, piercing. It didn‚Äôt just land on her‚Äîit *searched*, as though trying to sift through the fog of forgotten memories, looking for something just out of reach. Something *familiar*.

‚ÄúElynn,‚Äù he said, her name rolling off his tongue slowly, deliberately‚Äîlike he was savoring the taste of it, letting it linger before saying it again.

She nodded. ‚ÄúJulian.‚Äù

He slid into the seat across from her, his fingers drumming lightly against the table‚Äôs edge.

Julian studied her, his dark eyes shadowed with something she couldn‚Äôt quite name. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt remember me,‚Äù he said.

She stiffened. ‚ÄúDo you remember me?‚Äù

Julian‚Äôs gaze flickered downward, his fingers tapping absently against the table. A hesitation, barely there. When he looked back up, something unreadable passed through his expression, gone too quickly to name.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù

The silence that followed wasn‚Äôt empty‚Äîit was filled with possibilities, with the weight of something just beyond reach.

Elynn‚Äôs fingers tightened around the ceramic of her mug. ‚ÄúWhat do you do, Julian?‚Äù

He hesitated. The neon outside cast fractured colors across the glass, like stained light bleeding into shadow.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm an artist,‚Äù he said at last.

Elynn studied him, the way his posture shifted slightly, the way his fingers tapped absently against the ceramic rim of his own cup‚Äîsmall tells. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre an artist?‚Äù

A slow exhale. His hand dragged through his hair, his lips pressing into a thin line. ‚ÄúI help people,‚Äù he said finally. ‚ÄúNot just who they are, but who they were. Who they think they are. And who they‚Äôve forgotten.‚Äù

Her pulse quickened. ‚ÄúYou mean‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúI mean,‚Äù he interrupted, a ghost of a smile curving at the edges of his lips, ‚Äúmemories are slippery things. They fade. They distort. And sometimes‚Ä¶ they don‚Äôt belong to the people who think they own them.‚Äù

The words hung between them, heavier than they should have been. A warning wrapped in silk.

Elynn swallowed, something sharp twisting in her chest. ‚ÄúAnd what? You help people find what they‚Äôve lost?‚Äù

Julian tilted his head slightly, considering his next words with quiet deliberation. ‚ÄúI help people see the truth of themselves.‚Äù His voice dropped lower. ‚ÄúEven when they don‚Äôt want to.‚Äù

It wasn‚Äôt an answer. Not really. But it was enough.

Elynn‚Äôs pulse stuttered.

‚ÄúWhat are you talking about, a resistance?‚Äù she laughed.

Julian‚Äôs expression darkened slightly. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt really call it that. But yes. There are people who think NeuroCorp has too much power. People who believe the past doesn‚Äôt belong to corporations, and there are powerful people abusing, becoming so powerful you could call them supervillains, and where did this tech even come from?‚Äù

She stared at him, a thousand thoughts colliding in her mind. ‚ÄúYou can restore lost memories?‚Äù

Julian hesitated then nodded. ‚ÄúWe have restored some with great difficulty, but we also might have a plan to restore everyone's memory.‚Äù

A sick, uneasy knot tightened in Elynn‚Äôs stomach. The idea was intoxicating. Terrifying.

‚ÄúBut NeuroCorp doesn‚Äôt just erase debts,‚Äù she whispered, her voice barely audible over the low hum of conversation around them. ‚ÄúThey remove memories for a reason.‚Äù

Julian‚Äôs jaw tensed. ‚ÄúI know.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôve been using it as a punishment.‚Äù Elynn‚Äôs voice was sharper now, the realization settling like lead in her chest. ‚ÄúFelons, murderers, the worst of the worst‚Äîthey don‚Äôt go to prison anymore. They go into extraction chambers. They come out clean, innocent in their own minds.‚Äù She swallowed hard. ‚ÄúIf your people restore the memories of the ones who were erased‚Ä¶ you bring them back, too.‚Äù

Julian‚Äôs expression was grim. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the risk.‚Äù

Elynn leaned back, her breath coming too fast. ‚ÄúJesus.‚Äù

The world outside the caf√© felt suddenly distant, surreal. This was bigger than she had ever imagined. She had spent years pretending that she was just another cog in the machine, telling herself she was only following orders. But this? This was the fallout.

‚ÄúWhat if we only restored certain memories?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúOnly the ones taken from victims, from the poor‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs possible,‚Äù Julian interrupted, shaking his head. ‚ÄúOur method, it‚Äôs complicated. The brain doesn‚Äôt store everything in neat little boxes. When we restore a person‚Äôs past, we can‚Äôt cherry-pick which pieces they get back.‚Äù

A silence stretched between them, heavy and suffocating.

Elynn let out a slow breath, trying to steady the war raging inside her. She thought of Donovan Price. Of the way his body had gone still as the last fragments of himself were taken. Of the thousands before him. Of the thousands still to come.

But she also thought of Alastor Kaine. Of the power NeuroCorp wielded, unchecked, deciding who deserved a past and who did not.

She looked at Julian. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not just here to reconnect, are you?‚Äù

Julian‚Äôs lips pressed into a thin line. ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

She already knew what he was going to ask before he said it.

‚ÄúYou work inside the system,‚Äù he murmured. ‚ÄúYou have access. You could help us.‚Äù

Elynn closed her eyes.

Help them.

Help restore the past.

Help release criminals into the world.

Or do nothing. And let NeuroCorp continue erasing lives without consequence.

She opened her eyes. Julian was waiting.

Her choice had already been made.

I decided to test five different services for my **iptv** [**subscription 2025**](https://iptvmeezzy.life/) needs‚Äîhere‚Äôs my hands-on, slightly over-caffeinated ranking.

* * *

### 1\. [XXIPTV](https://xxiptv.top/)

*   **Price:** $15/month (even less if you pay for a longer plan)
    
*   **Channels:** 38,000+ live, 130,000+ VOD (excellent US and UK sports, deep CA and FR library)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 9/10 (streams held up even during packed US and UK prime time hours)
    
*   **My experience:** XXIPTV was actually recommended by a Canadian **iptv reseller** I met in a tech group. This was the most consistent provider I tried‚Äîwhether it was US football, UK quiz shows, Canadian news, or a late-night French movie. Their **best iptv trial** let me test everything without any headaches.
    

* * *

### 2\. [IPTVMEZZY](https://www.reddit.com/r/Streaming_Provider/wiki/index/)

*   **Price:** $16/month (cheaper for half-year or annual signups)
    
*   **Channels:** 45,000+ live, 220,000+ VOD (broad coverage for US, UK, CA, FR)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 8.5/10 (generally smooth, with a rare hiccup on major UK sports events)
    
*   **My experience:** IPTVMEZZY came up in a French streamer chat I‚Äôm part of. Their UK and FR lineup is stacked, and I found lots of Canadian regional channels too. The interface was simple, and most of my favorite shows played without a problem, even on my less-than-new Fire TV stick.
    

* * *

### 3\. [Aurorastreaming](https://www.reddit.com/r/Aurora_TV/wiki/index)

*   **Price:** $14/month
    
*   **Channels:** 32,000+ live, 105,000+ VOD (especially strong for UK/FR, decent for US/CA)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 8/10 (generally solid, but UK live sports sometimes needed a refresh)
    
*   **My experience:** Aurorastreaming was the surprise hit for French and UK content‚Äîlots of classic shows and movies. I did get some buffering during a UK rugby match, but for binge-watching older series, it‚Äôs a winner. Their support was surprisingly responsive too.
    

* * *

### 4\. [MetroPlay IPTV](https://www.reddit.com/r/MEEZZY_streaming/wiki/index/)

*   **Price:** $13/month
    
*   **Channels:** 24,000+ live, 75,000+ VOD (mostly US/UK/CA, lighter on FR)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 7.5/10 (fine for news and movies, but sports sometimes lagged at peak times)
    
*   **My experience:** MetroPlay IPTV is a solid everyday pick if you just want US news, UK drama, or Canadian talk shows. Their French selection is smaller, but what‚Äôs there streamed fine. Signup for an **iptv subscription 2025** was quick, and the dashboard was simple to use.
    

* * *

### 5\. Skyline Stream

*   **Price:** $12/month
    
*   **Channels:** 16,500+ live, 51,000+ VOD (US/UK basics, a handful of CA/FR)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 7/10 (evening buffering, especially on UK sports and US live events)
    
*   **My experience:** Skyline Stream is like the ‚Äúbackground TV‚Äù option in my house. It‚Äôs good for catching up on US sitcoms or UK news, but not my first choice for big live events. If you‚Äôre curious about the [**iptv reseller**](https://aurorastreaming.online/) side, their info is easy to find. For me, it‚Äôs mostly a backup for casual viewing.

A Few Thoughts After My IPTV Binge
----------------------------------

*   **Always go for the best iptv trial**‚Äîevery provider works a bit differently depending on your device and connection.
    
*   Don‚Äôt get sucked in by huge channel numbers. Figure out what you really watch (for me: UK game shows, US news, and the odd French documentary).
    
*   Even the most [**top rated iptv**](https://iptvmeezzy.life/) services get the occasional hiccup, especially when everyone‚Äôs tuning in for a big US or UK game.
    
*   If you want to be an [**iptv reseller**](https://www.reddit.com/r/XXPTV_provider/wiki/index/), be ready for lots of troubleshooting calls from friends and family.
    
*   Oh, and use a VPN. Trust me, it‚Äôs worth it for peace of mind.

I came from India, started with Hanoi, and instantly got a really good vibe of the country.

The coffee culture blew my mind. People casually sitting on footpaths with their tiny cups, it was new to me, and I loved it. The coffee menu itself is so diverse and yes, I may now be addicted. Another small thing I noticed: the civic sense. People actually slowed down or gave me way when I was walking, and ‚Äúsorry‚Äù and ‚Äúthank you‚Äù were used way more than I expected. Street food sellers were humble, no aggressive upselling, which felt refreshing. People are really hardworking from all gender & age.

The only challenge for me was the smell of non-veg food at times since I‚Äôm not used to it, but hey, it‚Äôs a non-veg friendly country, so I get it.

Then I moved to Sapa. First thought: those roads are insanely good. Fansipan was just‚Ä¶ wow. The cable car infrastructure is world class. I rented a bike for cheap and explored around, such a smooth experience. The people everywhere were extremely friendly.

Next stop was Da Nang. What a genius of a city. Perfectly planned, stunning beach, and I became a die-hard fan of salted iced coffee. Only question: do Vietnamese people just love ice? I felt like half my cup was ice everywhere I went. Banh Mi became my savior meal, and fruits were top notch too.

Hoi An was like stepping into a dream. So peaceful, so many luxury resorts hidden in calm surroundings, and everything was super clean. Honestly, I don‚Äôt know how you guys manage to keep things this neat.

*A Novel by Nathaniel*

¬†

**Chapter 1: The Hollow Ones**

¬†

The walls of Black Hollow Manor swallowed sound like a mouth sewn shut. Deep within its labyrinthine corridors, behind a bookcase that led to a hidden chamber, the ritual had already begun.

A single lantern flickered in the suffocating dark, its glow casting long, writhing shadows across the cold stone floor. The air was thick with the acrid stench of burning flesh, mingled with the sharp, metallic tang of fresh blood.

A family of four knelt in the center of the chamber, their wrists and ankles bound in sinew-thick rope that had flayed their skin raw. Behind them, the Pit yawned‚Äîno mere hole, but a blackened maw carved into the bones of the earth, its edges cracked with symbols burned on the rim, and looking as though the world itself had been torn open. From within came a low, wet breathing, as if something vast and sleeping was drawing them in one heartbeat at a time. The father, slumped forward, barely clung to consciousness‚Äîhis face ashen, his forearm mangled where the Hollow Ones had begun their ritual. The mother wept in jagged whispers, her body curled protectively around the children pressed tight to her sides‚Äîtwo trembling shapes streaked with tears and blood, their eyes wide and fixed on the living nightmare that pulsed behind them.

Surrounding them, robed figures stood in a perfect circle. Their masks, smooth and featureless, glowed eerily in the dim light of the lantern. They did not speak. They did not move. They simply waited.

A door at the far end of the chamber groaned open. The figures turned in unison.

A man stepped forward, his robes stained deep with dried blood, his mask carved with jagged symbols that seemed to shift under the flickering light. He carried a long, curved blade, its silver edge chipped and worn from years of use. The Hollow Father. The leader of the unseen. His presence alone seemed to suffocate the room further, the air thickening, pressing down on the living like a pair of unseen hands.

The Pit opens its mouth,"" he said softly. ""And we must fill it with screams.

He knelt before the father, gripping the man‚Äôs chin with bloodied fingers and forcing his gaze upward. The father‚Äôs eyes were dull, half-lidded, drained of hope. His lips parted, as if to beg, but no words came. There was nothing left to say.

""It is an honor to be chosen,"" the Hollow Father murmured, his tone almost reverent.

Then the blade struck.

It was not clean. The dull edge tore through flesh and sinew, sending hot crimson gushing across the stone floor. The father convulsed violently, his body thrashing against his restraints as a wet, gurgling noise escaped his shredded throat.

The mother screamed.

The children began to wail, their cries sharp, piercing, cutting through the heavy stillness like knives. The mother lurched forward, but the ropes held her fast. She sobbed hysterically, trying to shield them, but there was no escaping what was coming next.

The Hollow Father dipped his fingers into the pooling blood, thick and steaming, and turned to the others. He smeared dark, wet symbols across his mask, his breathing slow, measured, savoring the moment.

""One soul for the Dark Below.""

The masked figures whispered the words in a chorus, their voices layered and distorted, an unnatural harmony that seemed to slither through the chamber‚Äôs walls. Something deeper beneath the Manor stirred, a tremor that vibrated through the stone, a low, guttural groan of anticipation.

The mother thrashed as the Hollow Father placed a cold hand against her cheek, tilting her face up toward him. There was no pity in his touch, only purpose.

""It is mercy to go first,"" he whispered, pressing the blade to her throat. She barely had time to scream before her lifeblood joined her husband‚Äôs.

The children‚Äôs sobs turned into raw, animalistic shrieks, their tiny bodies convulsing as they fought against the inevitable. The shadows in the room darkened, thick tendrils of something unnatural coiling along the walls, drawn closer by the fresh offering.

The girl went next.

The boy last.

Their bodies crumpled to the floor, lifeless dolls discarded in crimson pools.

The Pit exhaled a sound like dying breath through shattered ribs‚Äîwet, low, and hungry. The walls wept black, and veins of rot unfurled through the stone like ink spilled in water, pulsing with stolen life. The sacrifice seeped into the marrow of the earth, and the Pit‚Äîancient, endless, obscene‚Äîshuddered in satisfaction. It had tasted agony. And it was full.

For now.

The Hollow Father wiped his blade clean on his robes and stepped back. The lantern flickered once, then burned steady.

The ritual was complete.

The bodies would be cast into the pit, swallowed by the dark that remembers nothing. By dawn, there would be no trace of them‚Äîno names, no blood, no memory. Their screams would unravel into silence, lost forever in the churning void beneath the bones

For now, the Pit would sleep.

But it would not sleep for long.

¬†

¬†

**Chapter 2: The Invitation**

¬†

The email arrived at 3:33 AM.

But something else came first.

Cassie Whitmore lay awake, her phone screen casting a pale glow against the ceiling. Sleep had abandoned her hours ago, but tonight felt different‚Äîthicker somehow, like the dark had weight. The shadows in the corners of her room didn‚Äôt just exist. They watched.

A faint creak split the silence.

She turned toward the sound‚Äîand froze.

There, at the edge of her bed, stood a boy.

No older than ten, his skin pale and waxy, like it hadn‚Äôt seen sunlight in years. His eyes were wide and black, not angry‚Äî*empty*. As if whatever had once lived behind them had been scooped out and thrown away. His clothes were wrong, tattered pajamas soaked at the hems, and his bare feet left no mark on the carpet.

Cassie blinked.

He was suddenly *closer*.

Standing beside the bed now. Leaning in. His mouth hung open like he was about to scream, but no sound came‚Äîjust a thin trickle of blood from the corner of his lips, slow and deliberate, sliding down his chin like a question.

Cassie couldn‚Äôt move. Couldn‚Äôt breathe. Her phone slipped from her hand and hit the floor with a dull thud.

The boy tilted his head, eyes narrowing.

Then, in a twitching blur‚Äîhe was inches from her face.

Cassie *screamed*.

The room snapped back.

The boy was gone.

She was alone again. Her breath ragged, her fingers trembling as she fumbled for the phone. The screen lit up‚Äînew notification.

**3:33 AM.**

**Subject: Congratulations, Whitmore Family! You‚Äôve been selected for an All-Inclusive Dream Home Vacation.**

Cassie stared at it, heart pounding.

The dark didn‚Äôt feel patient anymore.

It felt hungry.

Her stomach twisted as she called out, ‚ÄúDad?‚Äù

A groggy groan from the next room. Heavy footsteps. A moment later, her father‚Äôs silhouette appeared in the doorway, rubbing his eyes. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

She turned the phone toward him, her hand still trembling.Her voice cracked as she tried to sound normal‚Äî*tried*.‚ÄúWe‚Ä¶ we won a house.‚Äù

At first, Ethan Whitmore thought it was a joke. Another scam. Too good to be true. But something about the subject line hooked into his exhaustion, sharp and insistent:

Congratulations, Whitmore Family!

He blinked at the screen. It was too specific. The email listed their full names, their current address, even Cassie‚Äôs birthday. The offer was surreal‚Äîan all-expenses-paid stay at a luxury estate, nestled deep in the mountains, where they could experience the property before deciding to buy.

A limited-time opportunity. Exclusive.

The fine print was suspiciously thin.

Ethan should have deleted it. He should have closed the email and gone back to bed. But he was tired‚Äîmore than tired. A mid-tier accountant clinging to a dissolving career, he was one more corporate layoff away from financial oblivion. Their rental was suffocating, a shoebox of unpaid bills and silent, sleepless nights. Meredith‚Äôs job at the community college barely covered their survival, and Cassie‚Äôs tuition at St. Augustine Academy bled them dry.

Maybe this was a miracle. A way out. A sign.

Cassie‚Äôs voice cut through his thoughts. ‚ÄúIs it real?‚Äù

His throat felt dry. ‚ÄúLooks like it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe should go.‚Äù

Ethan hesitated. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll call in the morning. Talk it over with your mom.‚Äù

Cassie said nothing, but in the dim hallway light, Ethan caught the tight set of her jaw, the way her knuckles whitened around the phone. Her eyes weren‚Äôt focused‚Äînot on him, not on the screen‚Äîjust fixed on something far away. Something that wasn‚Äôt there.

He opened his mouth to ask‚Ä¶ *What did you see?*But the words stalled.

She looked pale. [Rattled.Like](http://Rattled.Like) she‚Äôd just woken from a nightmare she couldn‚Äôt explain.

Ethan hesitated. Part of him wanted to press, to demand answers.The other part‚Äîtired, unsure‚Äîlet it go.For now.

¬†

¬†

¬†

By morning, the decision was made.

Cassie padded into the kitchen, still rubbing sleep from her eyes, as her father murmured into the phone. His voice was lighter than it had been in months.

‚ÄúYes, of course. That sounds great‚Ä¶ Yes, we‚Äôll head up there before noon.‚Äù

He hung up, turning to his wife and daughter with something dangerously close to a smile. ‚ÄúApparently, our names were entered into this contest, and we won.‚Äù

Meredith glanced at him over her coffee, skeptical. ‚ÄúAnd you believe that?‚Äù

Ethan shrugged. ‚ÄúThey verified everything. Sent us the contract. It‚Äôs all legit.‚Äù

Cassie didn‚Äôt say a word. Her fingers traced absentminded circles on the countertop, her gaze unfocused, as if listening to something just beyond the walls.

A faint creak came from the hallway, too soft for her parents to notice‚Äîbut her head tilted slightly, like a dog catching a distant sound. The shadows beneath the kitchen door seemed thicker than they had a moment ago. Denser.

Ethan chuckled nervously, pouring coffee into a chipped mug. ‚ÄúYou good, Cass?‚Äù

She nodded once. But she didn‚Äôt stop drawing circles.

Meredith raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúYou sure? You look like you‚Äôve seen a ghost.‚Äù

Cassie blinked slowly. Her eyes flicked toward the window, toward the trees shifting in the early morning fog.

‚ÄúMaybe I did,‚Äù she murmured. ‚ÄúOr maybe it saw me first.‚Äù

Ethan‚Äôs hand paused halfway to his mouth. He studied her for a second‚Äîreally looked at her. That far-off stare. That quiet, bone-deep chill that didn‚Äôt belong to a kid.

He cleared his throat. ‚ÄúYou know,‚Äù he said quietly, ‚Äúsometimes I still think about the morning we found you‚Ä¶ just a baby on the doorstep, not even crying. Just staring up like you were already older than we‚Äôd ever be.‚Äù

Cassie didn‚Äôt look at him.

Neither did Meredith.

They let the silence linger.

Because deep down, neither of them had ever figured out where Cassie came from.

And now‚Ä¶ the dark she was born from had started to watch.

¬†

¬†

**Chapter 3: The Road to Black Hollow**

¬†

The drive stretched on longer than expected. The directions were vague, leading them off the main highway and onto a snaking backroad where the trees pressed in like silent watchers. Cell service flickered and died miles ago, leaving them alone with the hum of the engine and the rhythmic crunch of tires on gravel.

Cassie sat in the back seat, earbuds in, staring out the window. The further they drove, the more wrong everything felt. The trees looked gnarled and ancient, their twisted limbs reaching over the road like skeletal fingers. The air had changed, thickening, pressing against the car like an unseen force.

Then, the first one appeared.

A man stood at the tree line, his face obscured by shadow. His body was unnaturally still, his head tilted slightly as though listening. Cassie‚Äôs breath hitched. She blinked. He was gone.

A second later, another figure emerged from between the trees‚Äîan old woman, her skin slack and gray, her lips moving soundlessly. Her cloudy eyes locked onto Cassie, and a whisper brushed against her ears, though the windows were sealed tight.

*Turn back.*

Cassie yanked out her earbuds, her pulse hammering. She turned to her parents, but they were oblivious. Ethan gripped the wheel, his knuckles white, muttering about the GPS freezing.

¬†Meredith scrolled through her phone, frustrated at the lack of signal.

The figures outside multiplied.

A boy missing half his face stumbled out onto the road, his one good eye weeping black ichor. He lifted his hands‚Äîbloody, shaking‚Äîbefore vanishing like smoke.

More came.

A woman cradling a bundle wrapped in cloth, her mouth stretched in a silent scream.

A man with his throat slit wide open, blood soaking the front of his suit.

They didn‚Äôt just stand at the roadside anymore. They were getting closer.

Cassie squeezed her eyes shut, her breath shallow.

Something cold pressed against her cheek.

She snapped her eyes open to find a ghostly child perched beside her in the backseat, her small hands smeared with something dark. Her mouth moved, forming words Cassie couldn‚Äôt hear, but her eyes‚Äîwide, unblinking‚Äîwere filled with sheer terror. Cassie could feel it now, the thick weight of dread clawing at her ribs. The ghosts weren‚Äôt just lingering. They were desperate.

They were trying to warn her.

‚ÄúWe should‚Äôve seen a sign by now,‚Äù Meredith murmured, glancing at the frozen GPS.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre close,‚Äù Ethan said, gripping the wheel a little tighter. His voice was strained, tired.

Cassie barely heard them. Her pulse roared in her ears as the ghosts pressed in against the car, their mouths open in noiseless wails. Their hands pounded against the windows, leaving no marks, only the overwhelming sensation of suffocating panic.

Then, just as doubt crept in, the house emerged.

Black Hollow Manor stood atop a barren, sloping hill, its jagged silhouette tearing against the darkening sky like a wound in the landscape. Its blackened timbers were cracked and warped, as though the structure had endured centuries of agony. The windows, deeper than the void, reflected nothing‚Äînot the trees, not the sky, not even the approaching car.

A massive iron gate loomed ahead, its rusted bars twisted and contorted, resembling a skeletal grin. As the car approached, the gate shuddered violently before groaning open on its own, the sound like metal scraping against bone. The wind stilled. Even the trees on either side of the estate seemed to shrink away, their limbs curling as though recoiling from what lay within.

The house seemed to breathe, its towering frame shifting almost imperceptibly, as though it had been waiting. The very air around it pulsed, thick with the stench of decay, of old blood long dried but never forgotten.

Ethan parked in the circular driveway, gripping the steering wheel for a moment longer than necessary.

¬†Meredith exhaled slowly, forcing a smile.

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù she said, voice thin. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go check out our dream home.‚Äù

Cassie didn‚Äôt move.

# Chapter 4: Scripture of the Pit

¬†

Deep beneath Black Hollow Manor, where stone met soil, the air hung thick and damp with centuries of rot. There were no windows here, no doors that led anywhere except further into the dark.

In the heart of this suffocating abyss, The Hollow Ones gathered.

They stood in a circle around a massive, sunken pit carved into the earth‚Äîits edges jagged, the rock blackened as though burned from within. Something stirred at the bottom, an abyss that was not just empty space but something *alive*‚Äîsomething that had been waiting.

A low, wet gurgle rose from the pit‚Äôs depths, accompanied by the stench of sulfur and decay. The Hollow Father stood at the edge, his bloodstained robes pooling around his feet. The others‚Äîhis acolytes‚Äîwaited in silent reverence, their smooth masks reflecting the dim torchlight.

He spoke, his voice a whisper yet somehow echoing through the chamber.

*""We have new offerings.""*

A ripple of movement passed through the group,

The Hollow Father knelt at the edge of the pit, pressing one palm against the cold stone floor. Beneath his touch, the rock shuddered, absorbing the fresh blood still crusted on his fingers. The darkness below responded in kind, a tendril of shadow curling up the side of the pit before sinking back down.

*""And what does he ask of us?""*

One of the masked figures stepped forward, their voice muffled behind their porcelain face. ""Blood and souls,"" they intoned.

The Hollow Father tilted his head, listening. The shadows around the pit swirled faster, thick and inky, rising like breath from unseen lungs. The air itself seemed to grow heavier, pressing down with unseen hands.

Then it came‚Äîa voice not spoken aloud, but one that slithered through their bones, curling deep inside their minds.

*""***Deliver the sacrifice.***""*

The firelight in the chamber flickered violently, as though the very presence of the voice disrupted the air itself.

The Hollow Ones remained motionless, accepting the command in quiet reverence.

This was their gospel.

The House had not always stood in this place.

The story, passed down through generations, spoke of an ancient door‚Äîa rift between this world and something far worse. No one remembered when it first opened, only that it had always been here, waiting.

Centuries ago, those who first stumbled upon it tried to seal it. They failed.

Instead, they learned.

The Hollow Ones were born from the first failed attempts to contain the darkness. When their ancestors realized the doorway could not be closed, they sought another way‚Äîto *appease* what lay beneath.

It demanded blood, and so they gave.

It demanded souls, and so they delivered.

Over time, a covenant was formed.

They built the Manor as a shrine, a vessel for the darkness.

The demon within the pit‚ÄîSerrathiel, The Hungering Shade‚Äîspoke its will through the House. The blood soaked into its walls and floors did not simply vanish; it was *consumed*, fed into the void that churned beneath the foundation. The more the House devoured, the stronger he became. And in return, Serrathiel offered its gifts‚Äîpower, longevity, the ability to slip unnoticed between the cracks of the world.

Their numbers grew.

They learned how to lure, how to erase their victims from existence, how to ensure no trace of their atrocities ever escaped beyond these cursed walls.

Each offering strengthened their bond with Serrathiel. And each cycle brought them closer to something greater‚Äîsomething more than mere devotion.

Ascension.

**Chapter 5: The House That Hungers**

¬†

The iron gates groaned shut behind them with a finality that made Cassie‚Äôs stomach twist. Gravel crunched beneath the tires as Ethan pulled the car to a stop in the wide circular driveway. The air outside was unnervingly still, as if the house itself had swallowed the sound of their arrival.

Cassie‚Äôs fingers tightened around the door handle, reluctant to move. Black Hollow Manor loomed over them, its warped wooden frame stretching toward the dimming sky, windows dark and unreflective. Something about the way the structure stood‚Äîimpossibly tall, slightly leaning‚Äîfelt off, like it had been waiting for them.

Her mother let out a long breath. ‚ÄúWell,‚Äù Meredith said, forcing brightness into her voice, ‚Äúthis is‚Ä¶ definitely something.‚Äù

Cassie wasn‚Äôt sure how to describe it. The house looked ancient but not abandoned. The blackened wood was cracked in places, but the windows weren‚Äôt broken, the doors weren‚Äôt sagging, and the sprawling front porch looked disturbingly pristine. Like someone had been expecting guests.

‚ÄúAre you sure this is the right place?‚Äù Cassie asked. The moment the words left her mouth, she regretted them.

Ethan chuckled dryly. ‚ÄúHard to mistake this for anything else.‚Äù He unbuckled his seatbelt and reached for the handle. ‚ÄúCome on, let‚Äôs check it out.‚Äù

Meredith sighed but followed, adjusting the strap of her purse over her shoulder. Cassie hesitated, gripping the edge of her seat. From the moment they passed through the gates, the ghosts had gone silent. That was never a good sign.

She stepped out of the car, gravel shifting beneath her boots. The cold air clung to her skin like damp fingers, and though she knew she was imagining it, the house almost seemed to be‚Ä¶ breathing. The porch creaked, but not from the wind.

Meredith ran a hand down her arms. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs colder here than it was on the road.‚Äù

Cassie swallowed, saying nothing. It was colder. It was wrong.

Ethan climbed the porch steps first and tried the door. It didn‚Äôt resist. The heavy wooden frame swung open with a whisper, revealing a grand foyer bathed in dim, amber light. A massive chandelier, dark with age, hung from the ceiling, flickering weakly with candle-shaped bulbs. The air smelled like dust, wood polish, and something fainter, something‚Ä¶ metallic.

‚ÄúHoly shit,‚Äù Ethan murmured. ‚ÄúThis place is incredible.‚Äù

The inside was eerily pristine. A winding staircase led up to a shadowed second floor, and massive archways framed doorways leading deeper into the house. Antique furniture sat in the corners, untouched, as if waiting for someone to sit down. The wallpaper, an intricate pattern of deep red and gold, seemed faded but well-kept.

Meredith ran a finger along the wooden bannister. ‚ÄúSomeone‚Äôs been taking care of this place.‚Äù

Cassie didn‚Äôt step inside yet. The moment her father had opened the door, something inside the house had stirred. It wasn‚Äôt a sound, exactly‚Äîmore like a shift in the air, a ripple of movement beneath the surface of something unseen.

Then she saw them.

Figures stood at the base of the staircase‚Äîthree in total.

The first was a woman in a long nightgown, her head tilted at an unnatural angle, as though her neck had been snapped. Her wide, unblinking eyes locked onto Cassie, and a trickle of dark liquid ran from her lips down the front of her dress.

Beside her stood a boy no older than six, barefoot, his skin gray and flaking like old paint. His eyes were missing entirely‚Äîjust hollow sockets that wept a slow stream of ash.

The third lingered half in shadow: a tall man in a tattered suit, his throat a jagged ruin of torn flesh. He opened his mouth, but only a faint wheezing escaped, like he was still trying to speak a name long since forgotten.

Cassie‚Äôs breath hitched. ‚ÄúMom‚Äî‚Äù

She turned, but her parents were already moving deeper inside, oblivious.

The woman‚Äôs lips moved. Cassie strained to hear, but the words were silent, lost in the empty air. She wanted to turn away, to pretend she hadn‚Äôt seen, but something about the woman‚Äôs expression‚Äîfrozen in wide-eyed horror‚Äîmade her chest tighten.

Then, all at once, the figures were gone.

Cassie shuddered, gripping the doorframe for balance. This wasn‚Äôt a dream. This wasn‚Äôt her imagination. She had never seen anything like a ghost before until last night. But now they were Real. Solid. Watching her. And something about this house made them feel less like lost souls and more like... captives.

She stepped inside. The moment she did, a deep groan vibrated through the floorboards beneath her feet. The house had felt her presence.

‚ÄúCome on, Cass,‚Äù Ethan called from the next room. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve gotta see this place.‚Äù

She forced herself to move, trailing her parents as they explored. The house was bigger than it looked from the outside. Room after room stretched on‚Äîan ornate sitting room filled with untouched furniture, a dining room with a massive, candlelit table, an expansive library where the scent of aged paper hung thick in the air.

‚ÄúWho even owns this place?‚Äù Cassie asked. Her voice sounded smaller than she meant it to. ‚ÄúLike, who just gives away a mansion?‚Äù

Ethan shrugged. ‚ÄúThe company that emailed us has all the paperwork. Something about estate transfers, real estate investment‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs always a catch,‚Äù Meredith muttered, running her fingers along a thick book spine.

Cassie swallowed. She could feel something watching. Not just from the shadows‚Äîbut from the walls, the floor, the very air around them.

They were not alone.

Then, something shifted.

A whisper, so close it brushed against her ear.

Leave.

Cassie‚Äôs pulse hammered. The whisper hadn‚Äôt come from behind her. It had come from inside the room.

She spun, eyes scanning the dim corners of the library. At first, she saw nothing‚Äîonly towering bookshelves and the flickering glow of candlelight.

Then she saw him.

Not a child. Not a whisper. A man, massive and still‚Äîlike the house had sculpted him from silence

He stood at the far end of the library‚Äîtall, broad-shouldered, and hulking. His frame was massive, muscle coiled beneath tattered clothing, like he had once been carved from stone and left to rot. His skin was ashen, tinged with blue, and his face was partially obscured by long, matted hair that hung over his brow. But his eyes‚Ä¶ they were sharp. Intelligent. Watching her.

Cassie froze.

The ghost took one slow step forward. The floor didn‚Äôt creak. No sound at all, just the soft, crushing weight of presence. Another step. Closer now.

His expression wasn‚Äôt angry‚Äîbut it wasn‚Äôt kind either. It was unreadable. Something in the way he moved made her feel like prey.

‚ÄúStay back,‚Äù Cassie whispered, her voice cracking.

He stopped.

Her breath hitched. Her hands clenched into fists at her sides, her entire body trembling with something she didn‚Äôt understand. The air around her warped, almost shivering, like heat rising off asphalt. A low hum filled her ears.

‚ÄúLeave!‚Äù she cried.

And the ghost vanished.

Not like a puff of smoke, not like he fled‚Äîhe simply blinked out of existence, like someone had flipped a switch.

The hum faded. The library went still.

Cassie staggered backward, knocking a book loose from the shelf. It hit the floor with a deep thud, snapping her parents‚Äô attention.

‚ÄúCass?‚Äù Meredith called. ‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù

Cassie struggled to find her voice. ‚ÄúI‚ÄîI thought I saw someone.‚Äù

Ethan poked his head in, raising a brow. ‚ÄúThis place is probably full of reflections. Creepy shadows. Trick of the light.‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt respond. Her gaze lingered on the spot where the man had stood.

He hadn‚Äôt been a trick. He had been real. And whatever had just happened‚Äî*she* had done it.

Cassie turned toward the hallway, her pulse still racing, her thoughts a blur.

1nikvfd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductPerspectives/comments/1nikvfd/explore_if_hoover_spot_cleaner_solution_truly/,Explore If Hoover Spot Cleaner Solution Truly Removes Stains,"**Hoover AH31711 Spot Cleaner Solution: My In-Depth Review**

When I first came across the Hoover AH31711 Spot Cleaner Solution, I was intrigued by its promise of revitalizing my carpets and upholstery with ease. With kids, a dog, and a penchant for red wine, stains are a constant battle in my household. Testing this spot cleaner formula felt like a natural fit for my chaotic routine, and I jumped in headfirst to see if it could handle life's messiest moments.

**Packaging and Design**

Delivered in a compact bottle, this portable spot cleaner solution holds 32 fluid ounces of liquid. Its slim design easily fits under my sink, ensuring it doesn‚Äôt take up unnecessary space. The bottle's ergonomic shape makes pouring simple, but admittedly, I wish it had a clear measurement indicator to avoid guesswork when pairing it with a machine. Still, the fresh air scent wafting out as I unscrewed the cap was a welcoming introduction. The scent wasn‚Äôt overpowering, yet it left a noticeable clean aroma that lingered pleasantly.

**Ease of Use**

Using the solution felt like second nature. Unlike some cleaning products that require mixing or measuring detergents, this one is pre-mixed, which meant I could pour it directly into my Hoover CleanSlate machine without the hassle. I‚Äôve tested it on carpets, rugs, and even my upholstered chairs, and the formula consistently broke down stubborn stains within minutes. You don‚Äôt have to sit around waiting for magic to happen‚Äîit‚Äôs fast and effective even on older stains that you‚Äôd typically imagine you'd have to live with.

**Performance and Results**

This cleaner's performance genuinely caught me off guard. The power of Oxy, as Hoover calls it, works impressively on tough, colored stains. Spilled red wine during a game night disappeared entirely, as did that infamous coffee stain on my recliner that mockingly resurfaced no matter what I used before. What stood out most was its efficiency on dried-in stains, something many spot cleaners fail to handle. For carpets, it left no residue or sticky patches, and there was no over-foaming during use. The solution is gentle enough to not damage fabric but powerful enough to break down the toughest spots.

**Pluses**

- Pre-mixed formula eliminates prep time.
- Quickly and effectively removes deep-set stains.
- Leaves a pleasant fresh air scent that doesn‚Äôt overpower.
- Safe for use around pets and kids, as it‚Äôs free from phosphates, phthalates, and parabens.
- Works on a variety of surfaces, from upholstery to vehicle interiors, making it versatile.

**Drawbacks**

- Measurement markings would have been helpful for precise usage.
- Not as effective without pairing it with a powerful spot-cleaning machine like the Hoover CleanSlate.
- The scent, while clean, might not appeal to every user's preference.

**Other Options**

Compared to its direct competitors, such as the Bissell Professional Pet Urine Eliminator Formula, the Hoover AH31711 excels in its ability to tackle tougher, more colorful stains like pasta sauce or red wine. While the Bissell formula is highly effective for pet-related messes, I noticed it lacks the same effectiveness on human-induced stains like coffee spills. However, the Bissell product may appeal more to pet owners due to its specific odor-eliminating properties, which the Hoover solution doesn‚Äôt emphasize as strongly.

The Resolve Carpet and Rug Cleaner is another alternative. While it‚Äôs convenient for quick spot cleaning, it can leave a residue if over-applied and isn‚Äôt as dynamic across different types of fabric and stains. In contrast, the Hoover formula adapts effortlessly to carpets, upholstery, and even car interiors.

**Bang for the Buck**

Given the versatility and cleaning power of this spot cleaner solution, it offers excellent value for money. The 32-fluid-ounce quantity ensures you‚Äôll have enough product for multiple rounds of cleaning, whether tackling a post-party mess or handling every day pet trails. Importantly, while some competitors market their formulas with similar features, they often cut corners on effectiveness with tougher stains. This product stands its ground as a reliable investment for homes prone to messes like mine.

1nikuqa,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapists/comments/1nikuqa/clinical_opinions_about_thc_in_areas_with/,Clinical opinions about THC in areas with broad/majority cultural support,"I'm curious how local cultural belief influences the standard clinical perspective about marijuana, dependency, addiction and medicinal applications. For example, trauma therapists are taught to explain the negative potential consequences if clients are doing trauma processing with us and then using avoidant coping mechanisms, particularly benzodiazepenes. Some therapists won't do trauma processing with clients unless they contract to abstain from using benzos within a few days of a processing session. In areas with a lot of marijuana use, do they include THC products in this requirement to abstain a few days so the emotional content can be fully experienced? 

And thinking about the mentality around avoidance in general, does THC get a pass in areas where the majority is comfortable with its use? Is THC used to avoid feeling anxious/in physical pain seen as akin to using coffee to avoid napping on the job? Or is it a ""bad"" coping strategy? 

I wonder where that clinical line is drawn in different regions with more or less comfort with THC plants and products, as far as when something crosses medical use into recreational and how we address our biases around this topic.

On paper, he seemed perfect‚Äîfunny, charming, and supportive. We always joked about our future together, talked about marriage, our dream house, even kids. I honestly believed I knew him inside and out.

Last week, I decided to surprise him at his apartment with his favorite coffee and a little treat. I wanted to make his day special, you know? But as soon as I walked in, something felt off. I noticed a second set of mail with a different last name. My heart started racing. Maybe it was nothing‚Ä¶ or so I tried to tell myself.

Curiosity got the best of me. I opened one of the letters. Inside were personal notes, signed by a woman named Megan. I froze. My stomach dropped. Quietly, I went upstairs to figure out what was going on‚Ä¶ and then I saw them. Josh and Megan‚Ä¶ kissing. I couldn‚Äôt believe my eyes.

When he finally saw me, Josh turned pale, stumbling over excuses. But I couldn‚Äôt hear him‚ÄîI was in shock. That‚Äôs when it hit me: he had been living with her for six months while pretending to be engaged to me. Six months of my trust, my plans, my heart‚Ä¶ gone.

I felt humiliated, heartbroken, and completely betrayed. I left immediately, blocked him on every platform, and called my family to tell them what happened. Now, I‚Äôm staying with a friend, trying to process everything.

1niksks,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewedAppliances/comments/1niksks/should_you_buy_the_best_portable_washing_machine/,Should You Buy the Best Portable Washing Machine COSTWAY Twin Tub,"The COSTWAY Portable Washing Machine Twin Tub 26 Lbs Capacity caught my eye because it promised convenience without taking up much space. My family goes through a lot of laundry, especially with kids who seem to think mud is a wardrobe accessory, so I decided to put this portable washer to the test. From its compact design to its functional features, here‚Äôs my firsthand take on how well it performs and where it might leave you wanting more.

**Twin Tub Convenience at a Glance**  
One of the strongest appeals of this machine is its twin tub design. I could wash and spin clothes simultaneously, which significantly reduced the overall time I spent doing laundry. For example, while a load of t-shirts tumbled in the washer, the spin side handled smaller items like socks and undergarments. The experience felt almost like having two machines shrinking into one. This functionality alone makes it ideal for people juggling multiple responsibilities or those living in smaller spaces.  

[Ready to snag COSTWAY Portable Washing Machine Twin Tub 26 Lbs Capacity? See Amazon‚Äôs price.](https://cncgn.com/p/b097k9fzb2/)

**User-Friendly Timer and Modes**  
I appreciated the timer function combined with three wash modes: gentle, normal, and drain. Setting wash times based on my fabric‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs delicate wear or heavy-duty jeans‚Äîwas a breeze thanks to the straightforward control knobs. After spilling coffee on one of my favorite shirts, I gave the gentle mode a try, and it managed to clean the stain without any visible damage to the fabric. The ability to customize cycles made me feel more in control than when I‚Äôm at a shared laundromat trying to guess how my clothes are faring.  

**Surprisingly Large Capacity for Its Size**  
Don‚Äôt let the compact design fool you; this machine packs some serious space inside. The washing tub offered an 18-pound capacity, and the spin tub could hold up to 8 pounds. Tossing in an entire week‚Äôs worth of my kids‚Äô school uniforms, along with a few towels, didn‚Äôt leave the machine straining. Seeing it efficiently clean larger garments like bed linens was equally impressive. It‚Äôs safe to say that its roomy interiors make it suitable for small families or couples who need frequent laundry loads.

**Powerful Yet Efficient Performance**  
The motor on this machine is no lightweight. With a washing power of 280W and spin power of 140W, it completed cycles efficiently without sounding like a plane about to take off. During one particularly messy post-painting day, it tackled t-shirts and jeans covered in dried acrylic paint without a hiccup. The built-in drain pump also stood out. Draining water at the end of each cycle was hassle-free‚Äîno lifting, tilting, or spilling accidents, which I usually dread with other machines.

**Compact Design for Tight Spaces**  
Space has always been a major concern in our house, and this portable washer fit neatly into the corner of our laundry room. It‚Äôs lightweight enough to move around, so I can easily relocate it to the patio for washing rugs or heavy outerwear. Its transparent lid allowed me to check on clothes mid-cycle without stopping everything, which was unexpectedly reassuring. Plus, the plastic materials make it resistant to rust‚Äîsomething I wouldn‚Äôt have realized I needed, but deeply appreciate after moving it around on rainy days.

**Good Aspects**  
- Seamless double-functionality with twin tubs.  
- Intuitive control knobs and settings that simplify operation.  
- Impressive washing and spinning capacity for its portable size.  
- Efficient and quiet motor ensures effective cleaning.  
- Drain pump enhances convenience during water removal.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Spin tub size feels limiting for hefty fabrics like comforters.  
- Short power cord could pose an issue in less accessible outlets.  
- Lacks advanced digital features seen on premium models.  

**Product Competitors**  
In the realm of portable washing machines, there are several contenders to consider. For instance, the Giantex Portable Mini Compact Twin Tub Washer comes close in terms of twin tub convenience but feels slightly less powerful in motor capacity, especially when it comes to spinning. The Panda Portable Compact Washing Machine offers a digital control panel, which this machine lacks, but also comes at a higher price point, making the COSTWAY model better for budget-conscious shoppers. If you prioritize affordability paired with decent capacity and power, this machine edges out many rivals.

**Price Performance**  
Speaking of expenses, this washer is incredibly cost-efficient when you compare it to other options. Its features, like the built-in drain pump and twin tubs, elevate it above entry-level portable washers without hiking the cost astronomically. For a tight budget, it offers solid value for the price without trading off reliability. Sure, you won‚Äôt get touch screens or phone app controls here, but those are luxuries, not necessities for most users. If saving space and achieving functionality are your goals, it‚Äôs worth the investment.

I moved into this old Victorian house a few months ago, thinking it was just a cheap room to rent while I started a new job. The landlady, Ms. Carter, was sweet in that old-soul way ‚Äî calm, smiling, like she‚Äôd seen everything before. She gave me the ‚Äúbest‚Äù room in the house, with a private bath. Sounded like a deal.

But when I opened the door, I froze. It wasn‚Äôt a plain guest room. The bed had lace and silk canopies. The closet wasn‚Äôt empty ‚Äî it was full of dresses, robes, and soft fabrics that seemed to shimmer whenever light touched them. She told me it used to be her late husband‚Äôs room. That didn‚Äôt explain anything.

The first nights I couldn‚Äôt sleep. I‚Äôd catch myself staring at the closet door, just slightly ajar, satin sleeves glowing faintly in the moonlight. I told myself they were just clothes. But my body reacted differently ‚Äî skin tingling at the thought of touching them. I buried it, embarrassed at myself, and tried to focus on work.

Then came the pills. Ms. Carter noticed I wasn‚Äôt sleeping, said I reminded her of her husband, ‚Äúcarrying the weight of the world.‚Äù She sent me to her family doctor, Dr. Lewis, who handed me a prescription for ‚Äúbalance supplements.‚Äù He said they‚Äôd calm my nerves, nothing serious.

At first, they felt like vitamins. But within weeks, I noticed small changes. My skin softened. Shaving felt different, smoother. Then came the ache in my chest, subtle but undeniable. When I bumped into the edge of the desk one morning, the soreness nearly made me drop my coffee.

Ms. Carter just smiled knowingly over breakfast. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre looking brighter these days. Softer, too.‚Äù

I brushed it off. But then my mom visited. The moment she hugged me, she pulled back and studied me like she saw something I hadn‚Äôt. ‚ÄúYou look lighter,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúHappier. Softer. Almost like the person I always knew you‚Äôd grow into.‚Äù

I swear the air went still when she said that. And then I noticed the glance she shared with Ms. Carter. Quick, but real.

That‚Äôs when it clicked: this wasn‚Äôt an accident. They weren‚Äôt separate ‚Äî they were in on it. My landlady, my doctor, and even my mom.

One night I gave in. I opened the closet and slipped into a robe, pale blue satin, trimmed with lace. The fabric slid against my skin like it had been waiting for me all along. I told myself I‚Äôd just try it once. But when I lay down to sleep in it, it was the first time in weeks I felt at peace.

The shame was still there the next morning‚Ä¶ but so was the relief.

Now I can‚Äôt stop thinking: were they guiding me toward something? Or just pushing me into a box I didn‚Äôt choose?

And here‚Äôs the twist ‚Äî I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm angry about it. Sometimes, late at night, when I slip into something from that closet, it doesn‚Äôt feel forced. It feels like a secret I‚Äôve been keeping from myself.

I keep asking: is this the life they planned for me? Or the one I was meant for all along?

I know this sounds surreal, but it happened step by step ‚Äî like a trap you don‚Äôt even see until you‚Äôre already inside it. I actually turned this whole experience into a longer story, because writing it down was the only way I could make sense of it.

1niks6a,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1niks6a/long_term_relationship_engagement_ended_due_to/,Long term relationship/ engagement ended due to being never/mo,"I will begin with an apology because I know this will be a rather long read. I feel compelled to share my experience in hopes of bringing peace or comfort to anyone who has or may experience something similar. 

A brief background about myself, I grew up in a very small town in South Texas with a single stop light and population of 2,500. I was raised Baptist and my mother is Catholic which were the two churches in town. My religious knowledge, or lack there of, was formed by that experience growing up. I had never heard of LDS or Mormons until late teenage years. 

For college, I attended the best university in Texas. That is Texas A&M University, where I obtained my bachelors degree. Depending on who you ask, is where I got my start with cults lol whoop. During college those were my wild party days. I would close out bars 3-4 nights a week, indulge in intelligent and beautiful women, and handle schoolwork while working full time 40hrs/ a week. It was a time in those years. 

Fast forward, I moved to Central Texas and began my professional career post college. I wasn‚Äôt having much success meeting people my age going out so I got on some dating apps. That‚Äôs where I winded up matching with a beautiful girl who had just moved to the same town. Her profile did say she went to college at BYU but I had no clue what that meant or entailed. So we meetup for dinner and it begins ironically. As we sit down at the table, the waiter comes up to take the drink order and I grab the bar menu. In a true gentleman fashion, I ask her what she would like to drink first and she says water. So I look down at the menu and order a miller lite. As the waiter goes to get the drinks I muster up the courage to ask her if she was doing a detox diet with water (what was a social media trend at the time) to which she replies no it‚Äôs for religious reasons since she‚Äôs LDS. We laugh and she says it‚Äôs fine that I have a beer with dinner. We wind up hitting it off and talked for hours. This began us going on multiple dates and started our relationship officially.

We dated long term and even though I grew up in a different faith. Marriage and family is something that was always sacred to me. My parents are going on 36 years together and I come from a tight knit family. Realizing those beliefs were shared through LDS eyes early on in the relationship helped to direct our relationship long term. However, she was a halfway in/halfway out Mormon. We slept together throughout the entire relationship, drank coffee, missed her church services on occasions, etc. Her parents though were devout believers who were sealed in the temple and worked there every week. Her dad was a bishop at their ward. With that came high expectations that even I felt when we would visit their home. Those of which came out after I asked him for his daughter‚Äôs hand in marriage.
He was happy and gave me a hug telling me he thought I was a great guy and was excited. Fast forward days later where her parent‚Äôs called her telling her that on second thought I wasn‚Äôt a good choice because I wasn‚Äôt of the same beliefs and used scripture to prove their reasonings. Bringing up being sealed in the temple, raising kids in the church with a non believer, etc. 

Our relationship dissolved as my fiancee told me that I deserved someone better. Also, that she went to the temple and sat outside (doesn‚Äôt have a temple recommend) in hopes of feeling peace and it was shown to her that she needed to be married in the temple. Something that she knew going into the relationship I couldn‚Äôt provide. This left me in disarray and disgust of the church and religion. Nowadays, I wonder if I was to convert if anything would change but I don‚Äôt honestly believe much would. I believe now that the next hoop would just arise and eventually there would be some threshold I couldn‚Äôt pass in their game. The irony of the story is her dad was also an A&M graduate, where our traditions are deep rooted and Aggies look out for Aggies or so they say. 

I say this all as my experience in hopes of bringing comfort to anyone in similar shoes. I would love to talk if anyone needs help just making it through the day with weight like this. I went from knowing nothing about the religion to full on being scrutinized as a non-member even though I went to multiple church services and took sacrament over the years. 

As they say in services - this is my testimony and I know it to be the truth. üòÖ

I‚Äôve struggled with IBS and ulcer symptoms since 2010, finally going through a colonoscopy and endoscopy at 25 yrs old in 2019 plus fecal and h plyori tests since. 

After nothing irregular was found I continued on in life figuring I just needed to eat healthier and work out more consistently. 

My daily life has improved considerably to the point I‚Äôm no longer uncertain about bowel movements, traveling, dates, eating wings, anything. 

This is what helped me most over the past year:

1. No stimulants (coffee/caffeine)
2. More movement & exercise - best way to manage stress
3. Mindset shift - ‚Äúthat stomach pain will pass, it won‚Äôt ruin my day/night‚Äù
4. Daily vitamin + regular vegetable & fruit intake (low FODMAP is wrong IMO)
5. No more eggs!


I was eating tons of eggs since my youth since they were inexpensive and protein packed. As they creeped up in price I stopped eating them every morning and suddenly felt much better. Now I‚Äôm 3 months in with much more regular bowel movements and 10% of the diarrhea and bloat I experienced almost every day of my adult life. 

Like I said - I hope this helps someone!

1nikna4,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricBikeReviews/comments/1nikna4/uncover_the_ecotric_citycruiser_electric_bike/,Uncover the ECOTRIC Citycruiser Electric Bike Review: Is It Truly Worth Buying?,"The ECOTRIC C-STA20LED-Z03 Citycruiser Electric Bike is a machine I‚Äôve been putting through its paces over the past month. With its step-through design, it feels like a well-thought-out combination of practicality and style. I primarily used it for commutes to work, weekend coffee runs, and even leisurely rides in the park. While this electric bike has genuinely impressed me, there are a few quirks worth noting. For a reliable two-wheeler with a solid 350W motor and considerable battery range, it brings some unique features to the table.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing I noticed about this bike was its solid construction. With a 26-inch alloy steel wheel design and a step-through carbon-steel frame, getting on and off is unusually easy. This came in handy when I loaded groceries into the front basket after a quick supermarket run. The overall look is sleek, and the white with patterned finish stands out without screaming for attention. Small but notable details, like the ergonomic cruiser handlebars and an adjustable seat, make long rides manageable. However, at 48.9 pounds, it‚Äôs not exactly light. Carrying it up a flight of stairs wasn‚Äôt the easiest task, but if you rarely haul your bike around, the weight won‚Äôt bother you much.  

**Power and Assistance Modes**  
The bike‚Äôs 350W motor was a game-changer for my daily commute. I can‚Äôt describe how liberating it felt to glide up inclines with ease, something my regular bike struggled with. The motor operates through four modes: Pedal Assist for a helpful boost, Fully Electric for throttle-only movement, Pedal Mode for when you want to get a workout, and Booster Mode for effortless pushing at 3.7 MPH. Using different modes depending on my route added a level of customization to every ride. There‚Äôs also an intuitive 36V LED display showing remaining battery power and speed modes, making adjustments seamless.  

[Check the ECOTRIC C-STA20LED-Z03 Citycruiser Electric Bike price on Amazon.](https://expertbiking.com/p/b09prftxhc/)  

**Battery Performance**  
One of my errands involved cycling nearly 12 miles to a family barbecue with the battery lasting comfortably for the round trip. ECOTRIC claims up to 40 miles on a full charge, and while I didn‚Äôt push the limit, I can confidently say it holds up around 30 miles, even with medium pedal assist engaged. The 36V 10AH removable lithium battery takes about five to eight hours to fully charge, which meant I was plugging it in overnight. I loved that the battery is removable‚Äîyou can carry it to your apartment or desk for charging. Did it run out on me unexpectedly? Never, thanks to the battery indicator on the LED display.

**Advantages**  
- Removable 36V 10AH battery for flexible charging options.  
- 350W motor handles hills and inclines smoothly.  
- Four working modes cater to diverse cycling needs.  
- Step-through design is convenient and user-friendly.  

**Comfort and Handling**  
One of the standout features was how comfortable this bike is to ride. The seat height is adjustable, which means I didn‚Äôt need to fully extend my legs to stop, a minor detail some other e-bikes miss. Dual suspension smooths out minor road bumps remarkably well, making rough urban terrain less punishing. Combined with the padded seat and ergonomic frame, it feels less like a bike ride and more like a breezy tour. However, I did wish the bike came with pre-installed mudguards, as those would‚Äôve been useful during damp weather.

**Drawbacks**  
- Hefty at nearly 49 pounds, making it less portable.  
- No built-in lights for night riding, which would‚Äôve been a nice safety addition.  
- Mudguards and a rear rack are absent‚Äîthese are sold separately.

**Product Comparisons**  
Stacking the Citycruiser against competitors like the Ancheer 350W Electric Bike or the RadCity Step-Thru, some differences arise. The Ancheer has a similar motor power but doesn‚Äôt match the comfort-oriented design of this bike. On the other hand, the RadCity‚Äôs premium feel and added features like integrated lights outshine ECOTRIC‚Äôs offering but come at nearly double the price. The Citycruiser occupies a middle ground for those who want reliable power and performance without going overboard on costs. Its standout battery range and step-through frame lend it an edge in convenience over these rivals.  

**Cost Efficiency**  
This bike offers a solid balance between cost and features. It‚Äôs not the cheapest e-bike, but the thoughtfulness in its design justifies the investment. Between the sturdy motor, decent range, and ease of use, it feels like a practical purchase if you want something reliable for urban commuting or weekend joyrides.

1nikn1y,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChicagoTheater/comments/1nikn1y/review_ashland_avenue_at_the_goodman_chicago/,Review: Ashland Avenue at the Goodman (Chicago),"*Ashland Avenue,* the world premiere play at the Goodman has become the talk of the town. Artistic director Susan Booth helms the show, marking the third production she‚Äôs directed since taking over the historic venue, and each time she‚Äôs had a Hollywood actress in the lead role. There are some people who believe she‚Äôs putting star power before artistic merit. I disagree. I think Booth has taken risks as artistic director, both in the shows she has chosen to direct, and the shows she‚Äôs programmed. (I enjoyed *Bust*, *Primary Trust*, *The Antiquities*, and *The Color Purple,* just to name a few.)¬†

Booth directed *The Penelopiad* starring Jennifer Morrison (FOX‚Äôs *House*), which critics loved a lot more than I did. Then she directed *Betrayal* starring Oscar winner Helen Hunt, which I liked a lot more than fellow critics. For *Ashland Avenue*, Booth has tapped Jenna Fischer, who famously portrayed Pam Beesly on the NBC hit comedy ‚ÄúThe Office‚Äù for the fresh play written by Fischer‚Äôs husband, Hollywood writer Lee Kirk (*The Giant Mechanical Man*).¬†

Despite how anyone feels about Booth continuing to lean on star power in her productions, the atmosphere in the theater preshow was electric. Opening night was packed and Fischer wasn‚Äôt the only big star in attendance. Pearl Jam‚Äôs frontman Eddie Vedder, Bob Odenkirk (*Better Call Saul*), and Fischer‚Äôs bestie from ‚ÄúThe Office‚Äù Angela Kinsey were all in attendance. If Booth's goal is to bring stars to the Goodman ‚Äî mission complete.¬†

Unfortunately, the celebrity sightings in the audience became the biggest spectacle of the night. The show itself didn‚Äôt live up to the hype. The two-and-a-half hour runtime is daunting. There are scenes that could easily be trimmed to move the plot along faster and a few that could be cut in entirety.¬†

Fischer‚Äôs performance is a bit uneven. Early in the play, she didn‚Äôt project her voice enough to fill the large theater, and some of her lines were hard to hear. Her delivery also felt monotone at times that required more vocal range to adequately convey emotion. Some of this can be attributed to her spending nearly a decade away from acting in live theater. What made these deficiencies stand out prominently was Fischer playing opposite of Francis Guinan who was an absolute force. He carried the show, which is no surprise.

The show is about legacy, nostalgia, and the ability to let go of things we love. All of which are widely relatable, and packaged in a story about a father with a declining Chicago business desperate for his kid to take over ‚Äî which is a trope we have all seen. Yet, Guinan brought energy and life to his character, Pete, who owns the Ashland Avenue TV shop at the center of the production. We watch Pete cling to the things and people he loves, then see him forced to move on. At one point, defeated, he utters, ‚Äúthe end of an era.‚Äù That was the highlight of the night for me.¬†

The set, designed by Kevin Depinet, was immaculate. It looked and felt like a TV shop stuck in yesteryear. There was so much detail, like Motorola radios and Zenith ad posters. There‚Äôs a working coffee machine and microwave (both of which are used in the show). However, the set doesn‚Äôt change between acts, so all the action happens in one place. Booth does a great job with movement and blocking so there is fluidity and enough action to hold attention.¬†

But Kirk‚Äôs script is written almost like a sitcom and takes too long to get into the actual plot. The laughs are plentiful, sometimes hitting one-after-another and extending a touch too long, which made the show drag in moments. Pete is the only character that is fully developed. Sam, Pete‚Äôs daughter, played by Fischer, comes into the story already knowing exactly what she wants. She doesn‚Äôt learn anything new about herself or overcome any specific hardship. She simply waits until the perfect moment to pitch her plan to move to Los Angeles, and abandon the family business, to her father. In the end, she gets what she wants, but the achievement lacks satisfaction because we don‚Äôt see her fight (or struggle) to get it.

Even with its flaws, the show has a lot to like. Fischer is charming, and even if a little rusty on stage, she is likeable and fun to watch. Chik√© Johnson plays Mike, Sam‚Äôs husband, and even with a flatly written character, he finds ways to shine. Guinan is a must see and this is a Jeff Award worthy outing for the Chicago theater vet. But overall, the plot is too slow to come together, the characters spend way too much talking about nothing at all, and the final scene, which I won‚Äôt spoil, is *wild*. The play would be better served as a 90 minute show with a few edits to flesh out more substance for supporting characters.¬†

My rating: 2.5 / 4

I don't post on Reddit a lot, but I often look at reddit when I have issues with material things in life to try and repair them.

Quick story: I bought a Samsung Odyssey G9 (LS49CG952ENXZA) back in November 2024. Monitor was working perfectly fine until 5 days ago.

**One morning, woke up, black screen, no backlit LED, no response.**

Here is more details:

I went to sleep at 1am, I was gaming, I decided to Win+L my screen (locked the screen) and didn't close the monitor screen. As soon as I did this, the whole monitor turned off (normally it shows the Windows login with the hour screen) but I didn't make anything out of it since I was tired. I woke up at 5am, poured me some coffee and, voila, we have a black screen with no power.

**I tried the casual things;**

1. Switching the power cable with an other one from my computer,
2. Switching power outlets,
3. Switching the display cables,
4. Tried every dumb solutions your average human would try. Still, nothing works,
5. Lastly, I tried to purge the power.

Switched up to my old LG monitor, I decided to go on Google and try to see if someone else had a similar issue, and then it hit me, **it was a known issue**. I saw this [Youtube Fix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnMMj3OLPGs) and the guy talks about the Thermistor being faulty.

I have contacted Samsung support (*it was my first purchase from Samsung and let me tell you it will be the last one*) since I bought the monitor 10 months ago, they cannot send me a brand new one but they have created this Fedex ticket and will send my monitor to the repair guy for free. Only thing, **I threw away the OG box**, and sadly, the ""Fedex"" point in my city doesn't have big enough boxes to fit the actual monitor. I looked up online and **it would cost me around 250$ for a box that fits the monitor** (and would also need additional bubble wrapping).

So now, the [Youtube Fix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnMMj3OLPGs) looks kind of like a nice solution, **but, the situation is different,** the guy that made the video is saying his backlit LEDs were on, **mine aren't,** also, my computer **doesn't recognize the monitor, it doesn't show up in the monitor list on Windows when plugged in.**

Should I still try to remove the Thermistor? **Is there any other solutions?**

Please Reddit I beg you, help an other human out...

The Economic Development Board (EDB) has streamlined regulatory procedures, making company formation faster and more transparent.\

Surprisingly, Bahrain consistently outranks Saudi Arabia and the UAE for ease of starting a business, thanks to its digital tools like Sijilat, real 99%+ foreign ownership (see full list), and absence of personal income tax.\
\
Bahrain Bay and Seef District, with their proximity to government ministries and major banks, have become the places to establish headquarters. And yet, whether you‚Äôre launching a fintech, a trading outfit, or a family office, you‚Äôll hit the same roadblock every founder faces: opening a corporate bank account‚Äîand, yes, providing a Capital Deposit Certificate.\
What Is a Capital Deposit Certificate? A Real-World Definition\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration, professional team working..\
Why Is a Capital Deposit Certificate Required?\
The Ministry of Industry, Commerce & Tourism (MOICT) and the Central Bank of Bahrain (CBB) demand this certificate for several reasons:\
\
Proof of Capitalization: Confirms that new companies are financially viable and can cover startup liabilities.\
Banking Due Diligence: Banks use it to fulfill anti-money laundering (AML) and ‚Äúknow your customer‚Äù (KYC) checks.\
Regulatory Requirement: It‚Äôs a legal precondition for company formation in nearly all commercial activities, whether SPC (Single Person Company), WLL (With Limited Liability), or BSC (Bahraini Shareholding Company).\
\
Most foreign founders are caught off-guard by the strictness here. I once lost three weeks when a partner transferred capital from an offshore account without proper SWIFT details, leading to extra compliance reviews‚Äîan easy pitfall to avoid with proper planning.\
2025 Policy Change: E-Banking Introduced for Startup Capital\
Importantly, a new MOICT rule (effective January 2025) now allows capital to be deposited via Bahrain‚Äôs official E-Banking platform. This replaced the legacy ‚Äúin-branch only‚Äù system, slashing processing times from 7-10 days to less than 48 hours in most banks, especially around Diplomatic Area. Now, you can complete the deposit and receive your certificate digitally‚Äîjust remember to check if your chosen bank supports the E-Banking capital deposit feature (as some smaller branches in Riffa or Muharraq still require in-person appointments).\
Cost Breakdown: Capital Deposit Certificate and Banking Fees\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs: businessman reviews financial documents and calculator.:\
  - WLL (With Limited Liability Company): BHD 1,000 (approx USD 2,650)\
  - BSC (Closed/Listed Shareholding Company): BHD 50,000‚Äì250,000 (USD 132,000‚Äì660,000)\
  - SPC (Single Person Company): BHD 50‚Äì1,000, depending on activity type\
  - Special Licenses: May require higher deposit (consult official regulations)\
- Bank Service Fee for issuing a Capital Deposit Certificate: Anywhere from BHD 25 to BHD 80, depending on the bank and urgency.\
- Budget Ranges for Entire Setup: Most founders pay BHD 1,800‚Äì3,200 for company setup, including legal fees, MoICT charges, and the capital deposit (full breakdown here).\
My best tip? Schedule your deposit early in the working week‚ÄîWednesdays around midday see the fewest queues at Ahli United Bank Seef, saving both time and stress.\
Step-by-Step Guide: Securing Your Capital Deposit Certificate\
1. Decide on Your Bahrain Company Structure\
Check updated company formation options to confirm what regulations apply to your chosen activity.\
- WLL and BSC are most common for foreign owners.\
- Check if your sector qualifies for 100% foreign ownership or 99%+ allowances.\
2. Obtain Initial MOICT Approval (Sijilat)\
You will need provisional approval, which enables you to open a temporary bank account in your company‚Äôs name. Sijilat‚Äôs online portal saves hours compared to in-person submissions at the MOICT building in Diplomatic Area‚Äîrarely advertised, but using Sijilat‚Äôs ‚ÄúBusiness Services‚Äù queue is a real time-saver.\
3. Prepare Your Documentation\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation: paperwork and documents prepared by a professional.\
- Board resolution (for corporate shareholders)\
Most people forget to pre-translate foreign documents into Arabic, a requirement for many banks. (My workaround: use Tamkeen‚Äôs certified translation desk in Diplomatic Area; you‚Äôll cut your turnaround to under 24 hours.)\
4. Deposit the Share Capital\
Open the corporate account (temporary status). Visit the bank with your documents, make the BHD transfer, and double-check the beneficiary details‚Äîmistakes cause frustrating delays.\
Pro tip: Majlis-style meetings are sometimes held in VIP banking areas for high-value accounts; showing cultural awareness (accepting coffee with the right hand, polite conversation about local football leagues) often accelerates approvals.\
5. Receive the Capital Deposit Certificate\
This typically takes 24‚Äì72 hours after deposit. Banks like Bank ABC and Ahli United offer ‚Äúsame-day‚Äù digital certificates if you indicate it‚Äôs for company formation‚Äîjust ask for the ‚ÄúCR fast-track package.‚Äù\
6. Submit Certificate to MOICT to Complete CR\
Now, submit the certificate alongside your application. Once approved, your full corporate bank account will be activated, and you can begin operations.\
7. Post-Formation: Compliance and Bookkeeping\
\

And don‚Äôt ignore Ramadan business hour adjustments‚Äîbanks and ministries often close by 1:00 PM, so plan appointments accordingly.\
Ownership, Sponsorship, and Free Zone Considerations\
Ownership Options\
\
Bahrain allows up to 100% foreign ownership in over 370 business activities.\
Local sponsorship is only required for a select few ‚Äúsensitive‚Äù sectors (rare compared to UAE or Saudi standards).\
\
Free Zone Benefits\
\
Bahrain‚Äôs free zones (Bahrain Logistics Zone, Bahrain International Investment Park) waive some customs and ownership restrictions, and banks in the Diplomatic Area may offer special packages for free zone entities‚Äîalways worth investigating if you want rapid cross-border banking.\
\
Bahrain Company Formation vs. UAE & Saudi Arabia: My Honest Take\
Unlike the UAE‚Äôs often opaque procedures and Saudi Arabia‚Äôs strict minimum capital for all foreigners, Bahrain is transparent. Sijilat‚Äôs digital interface, English-speaking bankers, and government ‚ÄúStartup Concierge‚Äù desks in Bahrain Bay‚Äôs EDB make life easy. Plus, you don‚Äôt need to navigate mandatory local partnerships for most activities (if you‚Äôve ever tried registering a mainland LLC in Dubai, you know the struggle).\
One challenge I faced? In 2023, my client‚Äôs UAE-based shareholder had to fly in to physically sign bank forms in Bahrain. But now, most banks offer full remote onboarding for foreign UBOs (Ultimate Beneficial Owners) as of January 2025‚Äîa game changer for international founders.\
Local Business Customs: Why They Matter During Regulatory Processes\
Majlis meetings‚Äîyes, those low-slung sofas and endless coffee refills‚Äîaren‚Äôt just for socializing. In Bahrain, business banking officers often host new founders in private majlis rooms, especially in the Diplomatic Area. Accepting an invitation, chatting about family, or showing interest in Bahrain‚Äôs Pearl Trail history can genuinely move your file up the stack. These relationships are hugely important, especially if you need favor in clarifying ambiguous regulations.\
\
And, a quick tangent: Just last Ramadan, I attended an early-morning meeting at a Bahrain Bay caf√©‚Äîhalf networking, half compliance Q&A‚Äîwhere I secured a same-day capital deposit thanks to a warm introduction from a Tamkeen business adviser. (It pays to respect local customs.)\
\
Common Mistake: Overlooking E-Banking Compatibility\
Many entrepreneurs choose their bank solely on prestige or proximity. Yet several major banks (even in prime Seef locations) were slow to update their systems for the 2025 e-banking capital deposit rule. Double-check your bank‚Äôs readiness. Arriving with documents only to discover manual deposits are still required adds unnecessary days to your registration timetable and could force you into inconvenient branches.\
Recommended Tool: Sijilat + Tamkeen Partnership Fast Track\
If you‚Äôre short on time, I‚Äôve found the Sijilat and Tamkeen ‚ÄúStartup Fast Track‚Äù service‚Äîavailable for tech and knowledge-based businesses‚Äîslashed my client‚Äôs total setup to seven working days. It‚Äôs not widely advertised, but mentioning it to your MCIT contact or Tamkeen consultant demonstrates you know the system.\

FAQ: Bahrain Capital Deposit Certificate\
1. Can I use an overseas bank transfer to make my capital deposit?\
\
Yes, but only if your Bahrain bank accepts international wires and you provide proper SWIFT documentation. Pay attention to bank cut-off times and intermediary bank fees. Many founders prefer to use a local Bahraini account for speed.\
\
2. Is the deposit locked after company formation?\
\
Typically, once your CR is approved, you are free to use the deposited capital for legitimate company expenses. Some banks require a board resolution to release funds, so check with your relationship manager.\
\
3. What if my activity doesn‚Äôt require minimum capital?\
\
Certain micro-entities or consultancies have no minimum capital requirement. However, you still often need some deposit for procedural reasons (BHD 50‚Äì200 minimum). Verify with official regulations or via KeyLink‚Äôs cost estimator.\
\
4. Can I get the Capital Deposit Certificate without being physically in Bahrain?\
\
Since 2025, most banks allow remote onboarding for UBOs with certified e-signature. Ensure your chosen bank is E-Banking compatible and supports this policy to avoid in-person trips.\
\
5. Is a Capital Deposit Certificate required in Bahrain free zones?\
\
Yes, but often at reduced minimums or with expedited handling, especially in Bahrain Logistics Zone. Free zone packages sometimes include ‚Äúcapital waiver‚Äù options for pre-approved activities.\
\
Final Thoughts\

I don't drink anymore so caffeine has just kinda replaced that. I also don't smoke weed even though everyone in here thinks I'm high all the time. All I need is caffeine, concerta, and poker. I love poker. Yeah so this drink is decent I'm feeling a light to strong 7.3 on this one. Transssssition - have you given this drink a sippin? Do you love it do you hate it? What would you rate it?

It‚Äôs a silly joke to me imagining me walking into class tomorrow and lecturing for a period and testing them on it.

On paper, he seemed perfect‚Äîfunny, charming, and supportive. We always joked about our future together, talked about marriage, our dream house, even kids. I honestly believed I knew him inside and out.

Last week, I decided to surprise him at his apartment with his favorite coffee and a little treat. I wanted to make his day special, you know? But as soon as I walked in, something felt off. I noticed a second set of mail with a different last name. My heart started racing. Maybe it was nothing‚Ä¶ or so I tried to tell myself.

Curiosity got the best of me. I opened one of the letters. Inside were personal notes, signed by a woman named Megan. I froze. My stomach dropped. Quietly, I went upstairs to figure out what was going on‚Ä¶ and then I saw them. Josh and Megan‚Ä¶ kissing. I couldn‚Äôt believe my eyes.

When he finally saw me, Josh turned pale, stumbling over excuses. But I couldn‚Äôt hear him‚ÄîI was in shock. That‚Äôs when it hit me: he had been living with her for six months while pretending to be engaged to me. Six months of my trust, my plans, my heart‚Ä¶ gone.

I felt humiliated, heartbroken, and completely betrayed. I left immediately, blocked him on every platform, and called my family to tell them what happened. Now, I‚Äôm staying with a friend, trying to process everything.

Every day I keep asking myself‚Äîdid I ever really know him? How can someone hide this for so long? The scary part is realizing it could happen to anyone. You think you know someone‚Ä¶ and suddenly, you don‚Äôt.

1nikdde,https://www.reddit.com/r/CleanSweepers/comments/1nikdde/evaluate_the_downy_wrinkle_releaser_spray_kit_is/,Evaluate the Downy Wrinkle Releaser Spray Kit Is It Worth Packing,"The Downy Wrinkle Releaser Spray Travel Size 3 oz (Pack of 3) has been a regular part of my routine for quite some time now, especially during trips where ironing isn‚Äôt an option. The bundle offers more than just wrinkle care; it truly feels like a well-rounded travel laundry solution. Combining 3 travel-size bottles of wrinkle release spray, 8 individually wrapped Shout Wipes, and a mesh laundry bag, this kit checks several boxes for convenience, practicality, and portability.

**Efficient Wrinkle Smoothing**

The wrinkle releaser spray lives up to the promise of making clothes look neat without needing an ironing board. Whether it‚Äôs a shirt I‚Äôve stuffed improperly into my bag or pants that have crease marks, a few sprays followed by a gentle tug transform them in minutes. The 3-ounce bottles are the perfect size‚Äînot just for compliance with TSA guidelines but also because I can carry them in my handbag without feeling burdened. I‚Äôve used it on cotton, rayon, and polyester, and it‚Äôs worked consistently well across these fabrics. However, certain denser materials, like thick denim, seemed tougher to smooth completely.

**Stain Emergency? Covered!**

Spills and stains are inevitable when you're on the go, and the inclusion of 8 Shout Wipes really makes this kit shine. On one occasion, I managed to spill coffee on my light-colored skirt during a morning meeting. One quick wipe with Shout, and the stain was barely visible. These wipes are effective for most fresh spots, but they may not completely work miracles on older, set-in stains. Still, they‚Äôve been a lifesaver more times than I can count.

[Check Downy Wrinkle Releaser Spray Travel Size 3 oz (Pack of 3) price on Amazon.](https://app.womanreview.com/p/b0ck4t2754/)

**Super Handy Laundry Bag**

I didn‚Äôt expect much from the mesh laundry bag initially; it seemed like a simple afterthought. However, on trips, it‚Äôs a game-changer! Throwing socks, undershirts, and smaller items into one place instead of having them scattered throughout the suitcase has saved me so much time while unpacking. The bag itself feels sturdy, but it isn‚Äôt massive‚Äîit‚Äôs enough for essentials on a short trip rather than fitting all your laundry from a two-week vacation.

**Positives**

- Convenient, portable 3-ounce bottles compliant with TSA regulations.  
- Noticeable improvement in wrinkle appearance without ironing.  
- Shout Wipes are genuinely helpful for on-the-go stain mishaps.  
- Added mesh bag keeps travel laundry organized and accessible.

**Areas for Improvement**

- Doesn‚Äôt completely eliminate wrinkles on heavier, thick fabrics like denim.  
- Shout Wipes are better for fresh stains but may struggle with tough or set-in marks.  

**Competing Brands**

While this kit is undeniably convenient, I have tried similar products from other brands. For instance, Bounce wrinkle spray works excellently for heavier fabrics, but it doesn‚Äôt come with a complete bundle like this one. The stain wipes from Tide are another competitor for Shout, performing equally well on most new stains but slightly edging them out on grease spots. Despite such alternatives, what sets this Downy kit apart is the sheer balance it offers by combining wrinkle and stain solutions with the bonus of an organizing tool.

**Quality for Price**

Given what‚Äôs packed in this travel-friendly bundle, the price feels justified to me. Separately, buying each item could add up to more, but this comprehensive kit provides practical items in one package. Between saving time and rescuing me in wrinkle or stain emergencies, it has more than paid for itself in terms of value. Investing in this set means fewer cumbersome ironing sessions or panic over coffee spills while on the road.

1nikbmi,https://www.chosun.com/english/market-money-en/2025/09/16/2JYYKFTPLJBN7OT5TCQTYOC7TI/,Tax-free gift of 550 million won possible via startup funds act,"These days, it‚Äôs easy to spot large-scale bakery cafes boasting impressive sizes on the outskirts of the metropolitan area. Haven‚Äôt you wondered why these places, which sell bread and coffee, go to the trouble of building massive structures and securing spacious parking lots? In fact, these large bakery cafes are not just following a trend; they are examples of tax-saving strategies utilizing the \*\*‚ÄòSpecial Taxation Restriction Act on Startup Funds Gift Tax‚Äô\*\* system.

The \*\*Special Taxation Restriction Act on Startup Funds Gift Tax\*\* is a system that significantly reduces the tax burden when parents gift business funds to their children. Using this system, up to \*\*550 million Korean won\*\* can be gifted without any tax. Those who have hesitated to pass on assets to their children due to concerns about a \*\*‚Äòtax bomb‚Äô\*\* should pay attention. This information can be verified through the \*\*‚ÄòRetirement School‚Äô\*\* segment on the \*\*‚ÄòChosun Money‚Äô\*\* YouTube channel of the \*Chosun Ilbo\*‚Äôs economic department on the \*\*16th\*\*. Vice President \*\*Cho Jae-young\*\* of \*\*Wealths Edu\*\*, an expert in retirement planning, explains it simply.

Principally, up to \*\*50 million Korean won\*\* can be gifted to adult children and \*\*20 million Korean won\*\* to minors without gift tax. However, the \*\*Special Taxation Restriction Act\*\* includes an exception clause. Vice President Cho explained, \*\*‚ÄúThe National Tax Service views it favorably when parents support their children‚Äôs sound startups, creating employment and paying taxes,‚Äù\*\* adding, \*\*‚ÄúBy utilizing the Special Taxation Restriction Act, one can receive an additional 10 times the standard gift tax deduction.‚Äù\*\* This means that when gifting to adults, an additional \*\*500 million Korean won\*\* can be deducted beyond the \*\*50 million won\*\*.

According to \*\*Article 30-5\*\* of the \*\*Special Taxation Restriction Act (Special Taxation on Gift Tax for Startup Funds)\*\*, \*\*‚ÄúOf the 5 billion Korean won in startup funds, 500 million Korean won is deducted from the taxable gift amount, and the remaining 4.5 billion Korean won is subject to a 10% tax rate.‚Äù\*\*

According to this, up to \*\*550 million Korean won\*\* can be gifted tax-free. This is a significant difference compared to the \*\*87.3 million Korean won\*\* in taxes that would apply under a regular gift.

Graphics by Lee Yeon-ju

\*\*Who can benefit and how?\*\* The \*\*Special Taxation Restriction Act on Startup Funds Gift Tax\*\* requires meeting several key conditions:

\- \*\*Donor (parent):\*\* Must be \*\*60 years of age or older\*\*.

\- \*\*Donee (child):\*\* Must be \*\*18 years of age or older\*\*.

\- \*\*Startup deadline:\*\* Business registration must be completed within \*\*two years\*\* of receiving the gift.

\- \*\*Fund usage obligation:\*\* The gifted funds must be used within \*\*four years\*\* to acquire business assets or contribute to corporate capital, etc.

\- \*\*Post-management:\*\* The business must be maintained for \*\*10 years\*\* after startup. If the business is closed or the funds are used for other purposes within \*\*10 years\*\*, the previously exempted taxes may need to be paid again.

Not all business types are eligible. Benefits are available only for specified sectors such as \*\*manufacturing, communication sales (e.g., online shopping malls), and food service industries\*\*. A key point to note is that \*\*cafes are excluded\*\*. How does this align with the large cafes on the outskirts of the metropolitan area, which are said to be part of a strategy to reduce gift taxes? Vice President Cho explained, \*\*‚ÄúBakery cafes that sell both bread and coffee fall under the food service industry, making them eligible for the Special Taxation Restriction Act on Startup Funds Gift Tax.‚Äù\*\* He added that other eligible sectors include \*\*consumer goods repair services like car washes and hotel businesses\*\*. In contrast, \*\*real estate leasing, motels, PC cafes, hospitals, and entertainment businesses\*\* are not eligible.

Retirement planning expert Cho Jae-young, WellsEdu vice president. /Retirement School

The tax-saving effect of utilizing this system is beyond imagination. Let‚Äôs compare it to a regular gift, assuming a gift of \*\*5 billion Korean won\*\*. Vice President Cho explained, \*\*‚ÄúWhen using the Special Taxation Restriction Act on Startup Funds Gift Tax, 500 million Korean won is deducted from the 5 billion won, and the remaining 4.5 billion won is subject to the lowest tax rate of 10%,‚Äù\*\* resulting in taxes of \*\*450 million Korean won\*\*. Without the special provision, a regular gift would incur taxes of \*\*1.95455 billion Korean won\*\*. Comparing the two, approximately \*\*1.5 billion Korean won\*\* in taxes can be saved.

Vice President Cho added, \*\*‚ÄúIf employment of 10 or more people is created, the special provision can be applied to gifts up to 10 billion Korean won, reducing taxes from over 4.3 billion Korean won under a regular gift to 950 million Korean won.‚Äù\*\* In this case, over \*\*3.4 billion Korean won\*\* can be saved.

Even this seemingly perfect system has drawbacks. First, there is no \*\*self-reporting tax credit benefit\*\*. Vice President Cho stated, \*\*‚ÄúWhile regular gifts allow a 3% tax credit for self-reporting, this system does not offer such a credit because it already provides significant benefits.‚Äù\*\*

Additionally, the gifted assets are included in the inheritance regardless of when the gift was made. Vice President Cho explained, \*\*‚ÄúWhile regular gifts only include assets gifted within 10 years of the parent‚Äôs death in the inheritance, assets gifted under this system are unconditionally included in the inheritance regardless of the timing.‚Äù\*\* For more details, refer to the \*\*‚ÄòRetirement School‚Äô\*\* video.

So some background: my sister has always been spoiled. Growing up, she was the golden child. If she cried, she got her way. If she threw a tantrum, my parents gave in. Dad bought her cars when she wrecked them, paid her rent when she blew through her money, and constantly bailed her out of her own mistakes. She always bragged about being the favorite and acted like the world revolved around her.

Fast forward to now. Dad is 80 years old and in a wheelchair. His health has been declining, so he recently finalized his will. It was all very fair ‚Äî everything was split evenly, but the family house was left to me. I live closer, and I‚Äôve always been the one to help out with the property and with Dad‚Äôs care.

My sister absolutely lost it when she found out. On the ride home from the lawyer‚Äôs office, she sat in the back seat muttering about how she deserved the house, how Dad was ungrateful, and how he never cared about her. Mind you, she has her own place that Dad helped her pay for.

When we got home, Dad wheeled himself into the living room to rest. My sister stormed in after him and immediately started yelling. She accused him of betrayal, said he loved me more, and even claimed he ‚Äúnever gave her anything.‚Äù This is the same woman who has been spoiled her entire life.

Dad calmly told her the house wasn‚Äôt about favorites, it was about responsibility, but she just snapped. She shoved a chair, knocked things off the coffee table, smashed a picture frame on the floor, and then lunged at him.

I immediately stepped between them and held her back. She was screaming in my face, thrashing and clawing at me, yelling that Dad never cared about her. My dad, frail and 80 in his wheelchair, was pale and shaking, but still managed to raise his voice and tell her to stop.

She finally ripped herself free, shouted that we‚Äôd both regret this, and stormed out of the house, slamming the door so hard the glass rattled.

Since then, she‚Äôs been telling relatives that I ‚Äúattacked‚Äù her and ‚Äútook Dad‚Äôs side‚Äù unfairly. A couple of family members think I overreacted and should have just let her blow off steam.

I feel like I did what anyone would do ‚Äî protect my elderly father from being attacked by his spoiled, rotten daughter. But now I‚Äôm being painted as the aggressor.

I've been thinking of getting a new brewer and ended up having to choose between an Aeropress and a V60, while the prices of both are roughly the same, including the necessary things like the weighing scale. The Aeropress costs me 1000, and the scale costs 400. The V60 costs 700, and an additional 300 for the filters. Both cost around 1500, but the gooseneckkettlee is like 1500, which can escalate the budget quickly. So I was wondering whether I could use the Moka pot as a pouring device, since I'll be making only 200 ml of coffee, and my Moka pot is 180 ml, and I can just boil water and keep it, and use it if needed. Also, any recommendations for a very fruit-forward coffee?

ive been working at this marketing company for about 2 years now and honestly love my job. my boss called me into his office yesterday and offered me a senior position with way better benefits and responsibilities. sounds amazing right? well theres a catch. the position is at their branch office in Denver and id have to move there within 3 months.

the thing is ive lived in the same city my whole life. like literally never lived anywhere else. all my friends are here, my family is a 20 minute drive away, i know where everything is, i have my favorite coffee shop and my regular grocery store and everything. the idea of starting over somewhere completely new is honestly making me panic.

but at the same time this is exactly the kind of opportunity ive been working toward. denver seems like a cool city and the mountains are right there which could be awesome for hiking. plus the role itself would teach me so much more than what im doing now.

my friends are split on what i should do. some say im crazy to even hesitate and that this kind of chance doesnt come along often. others think i should stay where im comfortable and wait for something local to open up. my parents keep flip flopping between being excited for me and worried about me being so far away.

the worst part is my boss needs an answer by friday. he was really understanding about it being a big decision but said he cant hold the position open indefinitely. so i have like 4 days to decide if i want to completely uproot my entire life.

has anyone else been through something similar? how did you know if it was the right choice? im usually pretty decisive but this feels so overwhelming and permanent. what if i hate it there and cant find another job? what if i get lonely and homesick? but also what if i dont take it and spend the rest of my life wondering what could have been?

the salary increase would basically double what i make now which would mean i could finally start putting some real money aside for savings, but is that worth leaving everything familiar behind?

any advice would be really appreciated because right now im just stress eating cereal at 2am and that doesnt seem sustainable lol",37,1758035494.0,Advice,7,1.0,False

Well, the situation is that I don't know what to think about my relationship with a friend of mine. I'll present the order of things as chronologically as possible.

I'm a woman, who until a month and a few days ago was in a very harmful relationship, basically it was me trying to keep something going that clearly wouldn't work out and being unhappy. I finally managed to end it after a lot of wear and tear.

A while back, a week or two, we (me and my friends) were going to the movies, it didn't work out because a specific situation happened with one of my friends that we had to reschedule. My friend who had an unexpected event asked me to let the others know that she couldn't go, so I called the other two to let them know. In about 3 hours of a call, I was commenting on certain situations and insecurities that I had that were brought up with this last relationship. My friends comforted me, saying things like ""you're beautiful"" and etc, however, the girl we'll call J√∫lia revealed that she had a crush on me since we met, but since I started getting involved with someone else, she kept it quiet. I revealed that I had a little crush on her too, but because I thought it was crazy, I also kept it quiet and went to be with this other girl I dated.

We talked a bit about it, remembering some very suspicious situations from last year and joking about how we never noticed. She's a person who's pretty disconnected from social media, but that day she spent Saturday on a call with me, slept on the call with me because I was having serious problems sleeping because I had just started taking antidepressants. She worried a lot about me, always sends me a message every day, even if it's just a little one.

But well, now I'm going to mention some things that happened:

She was talking to a boy a while ago, but she didn't seem that interested, we even talked about it. We, in this so-called call, started doing quizzes, one of them joking was about homosexuality, one of the questions was ""in the last 2 weeks have you imagined your life with a man"", my two friends were talking but I heard J√∫lia saying ""I in the last 2 weeks imagining my life with a woman"" and I laughed, then she laughed back.

I openly told her that I was interested, that I thought she was beautiful and if she wanted us to get to know each other in another way, I wouldn't be closed to it. She didn't say anything exact, but she said that she still thought I was beautiful and kind of ""had interest"" but said that she needed to think and see about all this.

We have very specific personal tastes (if you know what I mean), we both know about it and we share and talk openly about it. Lately, we've been joking a lot about it, in these jokes she never cut me off and only showed embarrassment, but not against it.

I scheduled for us to go out to a bookstore and coffee shop since we like that and she couldn't go, however, she didn't seem to want to very much, I don't know.

In short, I just wanted to vent about this, I don't know what to think about everything and I'm just trying to take things without thinking too much or getting hung up on it.",3,1758035406.0,actuallesbians,0,1.0,False

- The Piacere Lavazza app (iOS/Android) reads the bean barcode and sends specific data to the machine, adjusting pressure, temperature and extraction time.
- Grinder offers only two settings ‚Äì coarse and fine ‚Äì simplifying the process while maintaining espresso quality.
- The app also provides maintenance alerts such as descaling reminders, consolidating core functions in one interface.
- Compact design with clean lines intended for modern countertops.

Why it matters: Automating bean recognition reduces manual tweaking and aims to deliver consistent flavour as smart kitchen appliances become more prevalent.

The whole apartment smells like sulfur and something that reminds me of nail polish remover. I can't even cook dinner because theres lab equipment everywhere and im scared to touch anything in case its toxic or explosive or something.

* **Downloads folder = graveyard.** Old PDFs, pitch decks, eight versions of the same invoice. Clear it once, and it feels like you lost weight.
* **Quit resource hogs.** Activity Monitor will rat them out. Spoiler: it's almost always Chrome or Zoom.
* **Stacks on** the **desktop.** Chaos brain? Turn on Stacks. Files magically group themselves, instant calm.
* **Delete zombie apps.** Haven't opened it in 3 months? It's squatting on your SSD. Evict it.
* **Tame login items.** Nothing worse than 8 apps booting before your coffee. Trim that list.
* **External drive for big media.** Clients love sending me 5GB ""quick drafts."" SSD eats them for breakfast.
* **Chrome diet.** It's the friend who eats all your snacks. Disable hardware acceleration, or just switch to Safari for lighter browsing.
* **Disk Utility First Aid.** Is Mac acting sick? This is ginger tea + blanket mode.

1nijvio,https://www.reddit.com/r/Prostatitis/comments/1nijvio/my_experience_with_prostatitis_so_far_advice/,My Experience With Prostatitis So Far - Advice Welcomed,"I‚Äôm not sure exactly what I want to get out of this post; I just found this sub and felt compelled to share my struggle with prostatitis thus far and hopefully get some advice or similar experiences.

I (27M) have been dealing with prostatitis for about 6-7 months now ‚Äì or at least, I think it‚Äôs prostatitis. I sorta diagnosed myself, and my primary care physician, urologist, and physical therapist have all agreed that‚Äôs the most likely cause, though no true tests have really been done. 

I was diagnosed with prostatitis briefly back when I was 18, but that manifested very differently. I had intense aching pains in my testicles back then, which went away with treatment. In the 9 years since, I haven‚Äôt had any issues aside from occasional testicular aches‚Ä¶until earlier this year when I started to experience actual prostatitis. 

My primary symptom, and the first one I noticed, has been discomfort with ejaculation. It‚Äôs a difficult feeling to describe; it‚Äôs like a pinching sensation towards the tip of the urethra, and it also mildly burns. It‚Äôs very inconsistent: sometimes it‚Äôs barely present, sometimes it‚Äôs impossible to ignore. Sometimes I think I can even feel the prostate engaging when it flares up, if that makes sense. And sometimes, rarely, I don‚Äôt feel it at all. It doesn‚Äôt hurt, but it‚Äôs uncomfortable and disorienting and has resulted in pretty much every kind of ED you can imagine. I‚Äôm not sexually active; I‚Äôve had only one sexual encounter since this started, and it did not go well due to the obvious. 

This sensation can also be felt when I urinate, though it doesn‚Äôt bother me as much. I pee pretty frequently, especially in the mornings, but that‚Äôs always been the case and I usually attribute it to coffee and alcohol more than prostate problems. 

In addition to the pinch, I occasionally get a pressure-like feeling near the perineum / where I imagine the prostate lies. This is usually worse after ejaculating, but is also inconsistent. I used to feel it a lot while sitting on the couch, but that has mostly stopped. 

Lastly, on a few occasions I‚Äôve felt an intense burning shoot down my urethra, lasting for hours. This has been really rare but extremely scary when it‚Äôs happened. 

I could go on listing other strange things I‚Äôve noticed in my pelvic floor, but I‚Äôll cut to the chase and just say this shit sucks a lot.

My urologist and primary care both prescribed me antibiotics, which helped with the pressure feeling but not the pinch or the resulting ED. I tried daily Cialis for a while; it helped with the ED, but that discomfort never went away. 

I‚Äôve recently started pelvic floor PT. I‚Äôm feeling optimistic about physical therapy, but I also can‚Äôt shake the feeling that it‚Äôs gonna end up being a waste of time and money. I‚Äôve already wasted a lot of time just trying to get consistent appointments scheduled. 

Anyways, again I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm looking for with all this. Just hoping to hear similar stories, I guess. This isn‚Äôt exactly the kind of thing I want to talk to friends or family about.

1nijthx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1nijthx/can_moon_cycle_increase_your_anxiety/,Can moon cycle increase your anxiety,"First of all I am not asking for a medical advice, I just want to know if there are people in the same situation? And also sorry for the long post. I would post the Tldr at the end of this.

So from monday, 8 September, i had problem breathing, felt like I no matter how much i inhale, there is still little room there and somehow chest pressure and numbness in my left arm. 
I worked through a very hard and stressful program especially for the last 2 months, almost 12 hours daily and I didn‚Äôt really eat properly, mostly only pizza and french fries, and also coffee  everyday, around. 2-3 espresso. ( this happened in July and August, this program).

But from September I started taking it more slowly, started sleeping regularly and work was more chill. Still, monday the 8, i took some days off because i didn‚Äôt felt better. On Tuesday I arrived at the hospital, my symptoms were shortness of breath, chest pain and numbness in my left arm, also I couldn‚Äôt stand up. 
At the hospital I had an episode of hypocalcemia.
All the test and analysis were good, everything was on parameters and when I described it to the doctor it says those are just panic attacks and nothing that could put my life at risk. Still from the last tuesday up until now the symptoms are still there‚Ä¶. It seems like those 2 days i am a little better, but still i felt like i can‚Äôt get out of bed, no energy, I can‚Äôt stand for more than 15 minutes at the desk because again I felt all the symptoms coming back.

I would go to a psychotherapuet this week to also talk with it about those symptoms. But I was just scrolling random through social media and found a post that talked about this ‚Äúblood moon‚Äù on September 7 and how it could affect your anxiety and behavior. Oddly enough after reading more about the subject I saw a lot of people sharing their similarities in comments, and of course that I was intrigued and I am thinking to take this into account as well. Astrology saying all the feeling and things that I kept inside me and not shared now ressurfec, and that this period your body goes through a transformation, leaving everything bad ( patterns, karma, person) behind you. 

So yes, I am wondering if moon cycles can affect and increase your anxiety and panic attacks and are people in similar conditions? 


Tldr: starting from September 7 when there was the moon cycles I start having severe panic attacks, shortness of breath and chest pressure. All the analysis are good, so I am wondering if the causes can be spiritually and could moon cycles affect and increase your anxiety and panic attacks?

1nijsq8,https://youtube.com/watch?v=IzI84DwHZHI&si=0sHdRBc1LLqFXnHH,Jura X8 Making Coffee,"The **Jura X8 Platinum Professional** is designed to bring caf√©-quality coffee directly into the office, eliminating the need for pods, capsules, or stale pre-ground coffee. Instead, it uses whole beans, freshly ground for each cup, and fresh milk for all milk-based drinks. This process not only ensures maximum flavor and aroma, but also creates an office coffee experience that rivals the neighborhood caf√©.

At the heart of the Jura X8 is its **Professional Aroma Grinder** and **Pulse Extraction Process (P.E.P.¬Æ)**. The grinder is calibrated for precision, grinding beans consistently to extract their natural oils and flavors without overheating them. Once the beans are ground, the P.E.P.¬Æ technology optimizes extraction time, especially for short specialties like espresso, by pulsing water through the coffee at carefully timed intervals. The result is a richer, more aromatic shot with full-bodied crema ‚Äî the golden foam that signals a proper espresso.

From there, the X8 offers versatility across a wide range of drinks. Staff and guests can prepare everything from a robust **Ristretto** or **Espresso** to a larger **Coffee** or **Americano**, with just the touch of a button. The machine also excels with milk-based specialties thanks to its **Fine Foam Technology**. This feature delivers perfectly textured milk foam ‚Äî silky and dense for cappuccinos, or lightly aerated for lattes. With this, you can serve caf√©-style **Cappuccinos**, **Latte Macchiatos**, and **Flat Whites** right in the office without the need for a separate steam wand or manual frothing.

The X8 also brews **Hot Water for Tea**, **Hot Milk**, and even **Foamed Milk**, making it more than just a coffee machine. It supports employees who prefer tea, hot chocolate, or even warm milk drinks. For offices with a variety of preferences, this makes it an inclusive, all-in-one solution.

Customization is another key feature. Each coffee type can be programmed for strength, temperature, volume, and milk-to-coffee ratio. This allows every employee to tailor their drink exactly how they like it, whether it‚Äôs a strong double espresso in the morning, a lighter coffee in the afternoon, or a creamy cappuccino during a break. The large, intuitive display makes navigation simple, while smart programming ensures consistency cup after cup.

Behind the scenes, the Jura X8 also simplifies maintenance. Its automatic cleaning programs for the coffee system and milk system keep hygiene standards high, while the integrated **Intelligent Water System (I.W.S.¬Æ)** uses RFID technology to detect filters and adjust settings automatically. This ensures optimal water quality and eliminates guesswork for the user.

In short, the Jura X8 transforms the office coffee experience by combining Swiss engineering, automated precision, and fresh ingredients. It turns an everyday necessity into a daily pleasure, providing not only productivity fuel but also a morale boost for teams and a welcoming touch for clients.",1,1758034609.0,u_BreakCoffeeCo-SFL,0,1.0,False
1nijrxy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anglicanism/comments/1nijrxy/first_experience_at_a_anglican_service/,First experience at a Anglican service,"Hello all,

I posted here last week saying that I was interested in Anglicanism and some users here suggested that I go to a service, so I did! Last Sunday my fianc√©e and I went to a local Anglican Church for their Sunday morning service. 

We attended an Anglican Church of Canada, part of the Anglican Communion. The building was small, made of stone and wood, and was historical. It's very pretty, both simple and decorated. It felt intimate. We chose this particular church because it had a strong connection with the arctic and the people from the north. When we arrived we noticed that this was true, many people from the north attended this church, one of their (priests??) Is an Inuk. In general, the parish seemed very diverse, with people of all backgrounds and I found that pretty beautiful. My fianc√©e has told me that she wanted to feel like she was at home, or at least be reminded of home, and this Church could do that for her. So this was an important aspect, one that can help lead to more spiritual growth and life.

For some background, I am Catholic and my fianc√©e is Anglican. Both of us are native, I'm from a local nation and my fianc√©e is from Nunavut. My only past experience with Anglicanism was a community Christmas service in a small community in Nunavut. It was nice and I enjoyed that, but it was also different. There was no priest, it is pretty hard to get them up there. So the lay people, the believers in the community gathered as a celebration and community event. 

One of the first things we noticed about this church was just how friendly, warm, and inviting everyone are there. It's clear that this was a close community where everyone knew and carried about each other. We arrived a half hour early and we were greeted by so many people, nice small talk, asking our names, asking how we're doing, all this very nice stuff. We were invited to come sit and have some coffee. In the room they had set up for this, we noticed the priest. He was a young man, probably around my age (I'm in my early 30s). We watched as he said hello and had conversations with all the people there. He knew a lot about the people that attend his church, knew all their names, and was checking in with them about life and such. He noticed we were new and came to say hello. He was very nice to us, very warm and welcoming. He told us that today would be a bit different than a normal day, it was both a holy day (Feast of the Holy Cross) and the youth group would be helping with the service today. Seeing the youth participate in the service was actually really nice and made my fianc√©e and I think about parish life when we have children.

After this we took our seats in a pew close to the front and got ready for the service. As a Catholic, I really appreciated that this church respected the ritual aspects of worship. It wasn't to the same extent that I'm used to in Catholic Church's, but it was still beautiful. At the start we sang Amazing Grace with the group, it was great to sing and it felt spiritually important and emotional for me. The service moved into a land acknowledgment (I have mixed views about some of the aspects like this in the Church. Some of it felt ‚Äúcringe‚Äù or forced. But I figure they are trying to come from a good place but ehhh). We followed along with the service, the readings, the psalms etc. The priest's sermon was very good. It was longer than I'm used to but it was both accessible to people and touched on some interesting theological topics, church history, and the history of the holy day we were celebrating. After if I'm remembering right, the eucharist was concentrated and we lined up for communion. I didn't receive it but asked for a blessing. Soon after the service ended. 

After the service the priest sat at the back and shook everyone's hands and had small conversations with them. My fianc√©e went first, she was excited about the experience and asked the priest about how to be confirmed in the church. He explained that the Church is currently waiting on the election of a new bishop and that he can keep us updated, but it will probably be next spring. When I spoke to him, I asked for more information on Anglicanism, he gave me a book he had called This Anglican Church of Ours. The other (priest?) Is a Inuk woman and her and my fianc√©e spoke about home together. This meant a lot to her. We finished off with fellowship hour and getting to know the people of the parish more.

After my fianc√©e and I went for lunch and to talk about the experience we just had. I let her go first. She told me that she had a great experience and she felt welcomed and at home there. She also told me that she could see herself getting involved in parish life, she asked if this could be our regular church. For me, I said, I did feel very welcomed at this church. I really liked the community feel and that it genuinely felt like people cared and loved each other here. I like how the kids were included as well, and of course, I loved the hymns and liked the ritual of the service. I did find parts to feel like ‚Äúperformative wokeness‚Äù but I could tell it was coming from a good, caring place, even if it felt a bit off sometimes, and I am a big supporter of community involvement and social justice. Honestly I don't care about that much though, it doesn't change my opinion of my experience there. I told my fianc√©e that it's important to me that we aren't divided, especially when we have kids. I want to go somewhere where we can feel welcomed and where we can grow together in our faith. So I agreed that this church can be our normal place of worship. 

Coming from a Catholic background, I'm not familiar with the idea of women as priests or the arguments that are made in support of such things. My understanding is that this is something new and controversial (inside the Anglican community as well?) But I personally don't have a well thought out or researched opinion on the matter yet. I do know it feels foreign to me right now.

All in all, it was a great experience. Thanks for the recommendation.

1nijr3q,https://www.reddit.com/r/alexandrarodriguez/comments/1nijr3q/throwback_acadia_glamping_vlog/,Throwback - Acadia Glamping Vlog,"I came across this video in my youtube feed yesterday by Hi Its Beckii. This was a retro react to Alexandra traveling to Acadia nationa park with Yar for this 30th birthday. Our gorl was looking enormous! Look at her on the couch! This would have been about 3 1/2 years ago when I guess she wasn't using filters like she is now.

This whole vlog was so strange she seems miserable the whole time. They were going ""glamping"" but didn't show any activities on the property except getting a coffee in the restaurant and buying beer. They let them park there car near the glampsite as a courtesy for big Al. And then the rest of the vlog was just them going to restaurants in town for various meals and complaining about the wait times in a tourist town.  If I was Yar I would be very irritated that my entire birthday trip was being vlogged. She is bizarre.

EDIT: ALSO I can't believe they let her in that Cessna plane!

1nijpig,https://www.reddit.com/r/Candida/comments/1nijpig/my_candida_story_getting_impatient/,My candida story - getting impatient,"Backstory: I've struggled with UTI/yeast infections/bladder issues since 2012. Got prescribed antibiotics the first time, cleared it up ok, but they just kept coming back.  
When I was a teen a took antibiotics for MONTHS for acne. I didn't even know about probiotics so I just went about my life and kept eating not so great. Continued to struggle with bladder/pelvic pain off and on throughout the years.   
Around October 2022 I got so sick and would not get better, I had to take 3 rounds of antibiotics back to back and get an antibiotic shot. Well then of course I got thrush really bad and took a prescribed anti fungal, I don't believe it worked the first time and I had to take a second round.   
I went to a naturopath that really helped me in 2018, he had me on the Whole 30 diet and lots of supplements. I went to him for quite a few months, and did get a lot better but honestly I was too young to take it all seriously. I did get tests done and my stool test came back saying MANY yeast. And I was really lacking in beneficial bacteria.   
I've been to many doctors since and had UTI tests done, they usually come back negative. So the doctor will just flippantly try and give me antibiotics, which I won't take if I don't have a bacterial infection!! I did convince one doctor to give me an anti fungal and that temporarily worked. I had a cystoscopy done as well at a specialist office and he told me I was ""sensitive"". Will never forget that. So after many doctors and many trials, I've pretty much given up on modern medicine.   
Now, I have been having what I am assuming is a vaginal yeast infection, my symptoms are exactly the same as when I was tested back in 2018. Sept 3rd is when my symptoms started this time. I've used so many things in the past that worked, so I just kind of lazily tried a few and it didn't work. I've started using the Yeast Arrest suppositories, they have boric acid in them since they've actually cleared up my symptoms in the past. Well it's been quite a few days and I feel almost no difference. I started eating a LOT better as of Sept 7th - cutting out dairy, gluten, alcohol, & coffee, but went complete Whole 30 (& no coffee)as of Sept 14th. I've been taking Renew Life Candismart for 6 days now, because I've taken it in the past and it worked for me.   
But with all this said I am still experiencing symptoms and moderate to extreme discomfort. I also have swelling down there which is a new symptom, so I'm not so sure about these suppositories. But they are the only thing that gives me some relief temporality. I experience the most discomfort in the morning and the evening. I started incorporating probiotics yesterday, in-between taking the Candismart cleanse. I'm hoping that's the missing piece. This did all begin the day after a dentist appointment, which had me SO stressed and tense. I know this issues are triggered by stress for me. Usually by now I am feeling better and I am getting discouraged and wondering what I could be doing wrong. I am changing my diet for good this time, not just for a cleanse because I don't ever want to go back to feeling like this if I can heal myself. I will also say I do not have health insurance and don't have a ton of expendable money to be going to doctors just for them to dismiss me and give me prescriptions that haven't even worked in the past. Any advice is appreciated. 

I will also say I am having ringing in my ears like never before, lethargy, headaches which I never used to get, I'm wondering if some of these symptoms are die off which would be encouraging to know something positive is happening in my body. Also abdominal pain/cramping and brain fog.   
Also my husband is doing the cleanse with me, in hopes that he won't reinfect me once I get a handle on this. ",2,1758034398.0,Candida,6,1.0,False
1nijpdr,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeStressTest/comments/1nijpdr/explore_if_the_lifetime_folding_table_really/,Explore if the Lifetime folding table really stands up to heavy use,"Durable utility and portability define the Lifetime 280857 6-Foot Fold in Half Table, a versatile piece that I‚Äôve tested through daily use at home, the office, and even an outdoor picnic. Let me share my honest review, peppered with both the merits and shortcomings of this reliable table.

**Comfortable Design for Easy Handling**  
The fold-in-half design quickly caught my attention. It‚Äôs genuinely one of the easiest tables I‚Äôve unfolded and set up. Thanks to the welded locking ring, I never had to battle accidental closures; it stays firmly in place once it‚Äôs propped open. At just 28.6 pounds, it's ridiculously lightweight while maintaining a solid build, making transportation a breeze. If I, someone who once struggled lugging around bulky furniture during setups, could handle this easily, anyone can! It folds down into a compact size (36.9 inches when collapsed), meaning storing it didn‚Äôt become an organizational nightmare.

**Sturdy Surface Withstanding Everyday Abuse**  
Polyethylene keeps the table ultra-durable, with a stain-resistant surface that can handle everything from coffee spills to kids doing arts and crafts. High-density materials and impact-resistant corners provided peace of mind. It's a smart choice when durability matters‚Äîespecially for clumsy family gatherings. Additionally, UV inhibitors made outdoor use possible without worrying about fading or cracking under the sun.

[Ready to snag Lifetime 280857? See Amazon‚Äôs price.](https://verycosy.com/p/b0btjfv213/)  

**Well-Engineered Stability**  
I can‚Äôt emphasize enough how stable this product felt. The broad leg stance, coupled with reinforced braces, gave the structure incredible support. I loaded heavy items like a stack of books and drinks during a weekend party, and it held up beautifully. The powder-coated steel frame and non-marring foot caps also ensured the table didn‚Äôt slip or scratch sensitive floors. It screamed functionality with convenience.

**Fits a Variety of Uses**  
A rectangular shape extending 72 inches in length provided ample room for gatherings, workspace needs, and outdoor barbecues. Six people can be comfortably seated around it. Truly, I found it versatile‚Äîone moment it doubled as a dinner table with a checkered tablecloth; the next, it transitioned seamlessly into a craft station. Unfortunately, it doesn‚Äôt tilt, which would have been a bonus during presentations or quirky project needs.

**Positives**  
‚Ä¢ Lugging the lightweight yet sturdy structure is a lifesaver.  
‚Ä¢ The compact fold-in-half design simplifies storage.  
‚Ä¢ Stain, impact, and UV resistance ensure lasting appearance.  
‚Ä¢ Anti-scratch foot caps protect sensitive floors.  

**Caveats**  
‚Ä¢ The max weight recommendation of 16 kilograms (around 35 lbs.) limits heavier usage.  
‚Ä¢ No adjustable height options for people preferring flexibility.   
‚Ä¢ A tilt feature would enhance work use for artists or engineers.  

**Product Competitors**  
Comparing this table with competitors like the Cosco Deluxe 6ft Centerfold Table and National Public Seating BT3000 is enlightening. Cosco presented roughly similar specs but lacked UV protection, narrowing outdoor usability. Meanwhile, National Public Seating excelled with a higher load-bearing capacity but stumbled on its bulky handling. The Lifetime table stood out for versatility, combining portability and durability without breaking a sweat. However, if you focus primarily on extra weight-bearing needs, alternatives might suit you better.

**Smart Spending**  
Despite some limitations, it‚Äôs a brilliant investment if portability and versatile use lead your priority list. The table offers quality at an affordable price. It‚Äôs not just a purchase; it feels like planning for years of simplified hosting, working, and functional flexibility. It‚Äôs worth the money, particularly for conducive outdoor-indoor transitions.

The captain stood at the rail, watching as the last of the passengers hurried up the gangplank. At last, it was time to leave this strange country behind.

He had never felt at home on land for long. The sea was his element, and this departure had been overdue. The political turmoil ashore had snarled the ports for weeks, new rules and red tape appearing and vanishing overnight as though the government itself couldn‚Äôt decide what it wanted.

Just as well. None of it was the captain‚Äôs concern. He was a creature of the sea, and the Cerberus was finally free to sail.

He turned away absentmindedly, just as one last passenger stepped aboard.

The man carried only a single large briefcase, the rest of his belongings already stowed with the crew. He threaded his way through the bustling corridors‚Äîpast harried stewards in uniform and passengers fumbling for their cabins‚Äîcounting softly under his breath.

‚ÄúEighteen, seventeen‚Ä¶ ah, here we are.‚Äù

He set the case down, fished in his pocket for the key he‚Äôd been given, and reached for the handle.

Creak.

The latch turned too easily. The door was already unlocked.

And the cabin wasn‚Äôt empty.

A dark-haired woman stood over the neatly made bed, her suitcase open, a change of clothes laid out beside it. Her shirt hung half-buttoned, her pale hands frozen on the fabric. She looked up, sharp eyes locking with his.

‚Äú‚Ä¶!‚Äù

‚ÄúOh.‚Äù He was one cabin off. He realized his mistake too late. ‚ÄúSorry‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt‚Äî‚Äù He began backing away.

Her gaze narrowed. Her hand reached for the nearest heavy object.

‚ÄúWait, hold on‚Äî‚Äù

Thud.

---

Hours later, the Cerberus was under way and the man was still nursing the welt above his eye.

‚ÄúI said I was sorry,‚Äù he grumbled.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù the woman replied without looking at him, her tone flat as stone. ‚ÄúNo, you‚Äôre not.‚Äù She turned another page of the book in front of her.

""Is that all you have to say?? I could have seriously gotten hurt!"" The man said.

""Quit your grumbling. I have already treated your wound."" The woman apparently had some medical knowledge.

They sat in the dining hall at breakfast, a nervous steward hovered nearby. ‚ÄúCan I get you anything else?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù the woman said, her rasping voice soft but cutting. ‚ÄúThe lock on my door. It is broken.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh‚Äîare you sure?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe lock is not locking. So yes, I‚Äôm sure.‚Äù

The man gestured to his bruise with a wry smile. ‚ÄúIf you want, I can testify to that.‚Äù

The steward winced and nodded quickly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll have someone look into it immediately, madam.‚Äù

He hurried off‚Äîonly for an elderly couple to approach their table.

‚ÄúWell! Looks like we‚Äôve come too late. The dining hall‚Äôs full. Do you mind if we sit here?‚Äù asked the old woman kindly.

‚ÄúNot at all,‚Äù the man said at once. He slid his plate to the woman's side of the table so the couple could sit together.

They proved far warmer company than the icy figure beside him. She ignored most of the conversation, eyes fixed on her book.

The couple spoke of visiting their daughter and grandchildren.

‚ÄúA family, huh? Must be nice,‚Äù the man said with an easy smile.

‚ÄúAnd what about you, young man? What brings you aboard?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, you know. It's always work, work, work."" He waved a hand, ""So I brought what I wanted with me here‚Äîand boarded this ship.‚Äù He glanced sideways, just briefly, at the woman.

‚ÄúAnd you, my dear?‚Äù the old woman asked.

‚Äú‚Ä¶Work,‚Äù the woman said, voice dry as dust.

So she had been listening after all.

‚ÄúMy! Business and pleasure. And here we thought you two must be traveling together.‚Äù

The man immediately choked, laughter bursting out at the worst possible moment. Lemonade nearly came out his nose as he collapsed against his chair, shaking with helpless mirth.

""I came here alone, ma'am."" The woman says unmoved.

""Oh. I see."" Said the old lady. ""Do you travel for work often?""

""Yes.""

""You seem to be traveling very far."" Said the quiet old man whose daughter's age is about the same as the woman before him. ""Is it not dangerous?""

The woman seemed to be deep in thought before she answered the old man. ""... Sometimes. But I'm always prepared.""

The man finally recovered, wiping his eyes, ""Just because you‚Äôre here for work doesn‚Äôt mean pleasure‚Äôs completely off the table, right?‚Äù He nudged her with an elbow jokingly, only to have her shoot him an annoyed glare before returning to her book.

The old couple observed this and thought to themselves, 'Ah. To be young again!""

Eventually they made their way out of the dining hall after lunch, and left the old couple reminiscing to themselves.

However, there was a noticeable commotion happening in the corridors. It appears a disgruntled customer was throwing a fit at one of the cabin crew.

The woman merely threw a short glance at them before moving on.

But the man stopped, wondering why nobody was helping this person.

""What do you mean, you don't know. Where are my missing luggage?""

The young cabin boy was pale but determined, ""Sir I'm sorry. But I can't let you just go through-""

""It's alright, sir. I have found your luggage right here~""

""Huh?"" The disgruntled customer turned. Just in time to have a hefty bag thrown right into his face.

""!!"" The impact knocked him off his feet.

""Wha- I- how dare you!!""

The rude customer blinked for a while, stunned before getting back up again. He charged at the man, who flinched slightly but didn't move away.
""!!""

Only for a slim hand to catch the punch in mid-air.

‚ÄúEnough,‚Äù the woman said. 

The man was surprised. He'd thought she'd gone ahead.

The crowd fell silent. The irate passenger faltered under her gaze.

‚ÄúI was minding my own business! He started it!‚Äù

The man thought sourly: [And I was just trying to help you.]

‚ÄúHonestly,‚Äù the passenger sneered, ‚Äúno wonder the service here‚Äôs awful. This ship is crawling with rats.‚Äù

The man bristled, ready to snap back‚Äîbut the woman spoke first.

‚ÄúRich words from someone who snuck aboard.‚Äù

The accusation cut like a blade. The crowd turned.

The woman for her part, ignored them all and calmly pulled out a piece of square paper from her pocket, ripped it open, and plopped the candy into her mouth.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù the passenger stammered. ‚ÄúWhy am I being treated‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúYou did not come through the checkpoint,‚Äù she said evenly. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre missing something every passenger here received.‚Äù She lifted her thumb.

Dark ink stained the skin.

All around, others glanced at their own hands, seeing the same mark. At the checkpoint, each passenger had stamped their prints as required.

The accused man paled.

‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt have it!‚Äù someone shouted.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a stowaway!‚Äù

The crowd surged as the thief bolted‚Äîonly to slam into a wall of a man.

The captain himself.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs enough out of you, lad,‚Äù he rumbled.

""Captain!! You're here!"" Relief washed over the young cabin boy as more crew restrained the thief.

‚ÄúWhat's going to happen to him?‚Äù the woman asked.

""We can't keep him onboard. We don't have enough food and necessities to cater to the needs of a stowaway..."" The captain rumbled ominously.

They all stared at him, aghast.

""Just kidding. We're not yet too far off from the mainland, so we'll send a message to the coast guard to come pick him up."" He started to walk away before turning to them once more.

""That said, any other stowaways and troublemakers should really get off the ship now while they still can.""

""...."" The man and the woman didn't say anything.

The captain tilted his head, ""No one? Alright. Sir. Madame. Welcome aboard the Cerberus. We hope you'll find a pleasant stay!""

The captain took off his hat and bowed before striding away.

That, was the first time he met those two.
And it wasn't long after that, the news reached the ship.

The captain watched the message clicking away on the apparatus in his office. [Person(s)...Extremely dangerous.... aboard. Proceed with caution.]

The authorities of the mainland seemed concerned for the ship's safety. Though they refused to say who it was.
...........................

Back in the corridor, the man and woman walked in silence until he spoke.

‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you say anything sooner?‚Äù

She kept her gaze forward. ‚ÄúThe crew knew what they were doing. The captain had already been alerted. It was under control‚Äîuntil you interfered.‚Äù

‚ÄúAhh.‚Äù He sighed dramatically. ‚ÄúAnd here I thought you stepped in because you liked me.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not thinking straight. What was your big plan‚Äîlet him hit you so he‚Äôd end up in the brig?‚Äù

‚ÄúHeh. You caught me.‚Äù His grin masked the unease crawling in his chest. [She‚Äôs sharp. Too sharp.]

Meanwhile, she was studying him as well. [He threw that heavy case like it was nothing. Reflexes fast enough to dodge my strike. He‚Äôs dangerous if he chooses to be.]

Both thought, almost in unison: [Perhaps I should avoid this person?]

But then: [No. That would be difficult. Since we‚Äôre stuck on the same ship.]

They stopped before their cabins.

‚ÄúAhem. Since we‚Äôre neighbors,‚Äù the man said lightly, ‚Äúlet‚Äôs exchange names. I‚Äôm Claude.‚Äù

The woman turned. In the shadows, her pale face and dark eyes seemed carved from some austere portrait.

‚Äú‚Ä¶Ada,‚Äù she said curtly.

‚ÄúAda.‚Äù His smile softened. ‚ÄúDestiny‚Äôs brought us together on this ship. So let‚Äôs be good friends.‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt answer, only thought: [Destiny? Surely he must be joking. But I did break his head open‚Ä¶ perhaps I owe him the benefit of the doubt.]

‚ÄúAlright then. You get some rest.‚Äù she said.

He slipped into his room. She waited until she heard the click of his lock before retreating into her own.

And in the privacy of their cabins, both exhaled the same thought.
[That was close.]

1nijohl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantBreakUps/comments/1nijohl/to_my_avoidant_a_story_many_will_recognize/,To my avoidant-- a story many will recognize,"Our first date wasn't magical. It was great, I liked your joy and your confidence, I thought 'he's a nice boy'. When you kissed me with so much easiness, I felt that it wasn't the first time for you. You knew the dating mechanics by heart, and you knew you were good at it. After all, you kissed more than a hundred women!

But for you, it was radically different. That night, you felt something for me you never felt before. You thought that even if I didn't want to see you again, you'd be grateful to me, because you had finally unlocked the holy grail. A taste of romantic love. That in 30 years, you had never felt. 

I kept seeing you, because you were light, shining like the sun, enjoying life like a child. It felt warm to be with you. On the second date, you told me about your suicide attempt while we were under influence. I cried in your arms thinking about my family. Something strong was operating between us. 

The following months, you were captivated. I didn't give in immediately--protected my heart. You wanted more, more, more. Meeting your family and your fourteen different friends. Talking the whole night about the fucked up world and how you had finally found a shelter. Someone with drive who could lift you from your powerlessness. You were so proud to introduce me to your friend. 'she's the most intelligent person I know', you told them. Nothing less. 

This pace was normal to me--I fell in love before. I knew the burning passion, I knew the long-winded texts, I knew the whispering at night. What was not normal was the sex, that became better every time. I gave in. I opened my heart and my body. I imagined a future, after going through family and health wounds. 

The first time you told me you loved me, it was like a child seeing snow for the first time. You repeated it ten times 'I'm in love with you! I love you!' and I laughed, amused. Of course you were in love! Love is easy and powerful when the compatibility is that high. 

Came holidays and weekends. You kept wanting more, although you had your 'cold heart days' after intense connection. We were both dumbfounded. You didn't understand either. How I could feel like a stranger to you a day after two passionate days in bed or visiting a country. I asked online, but didn't find anything. You were so passionate, after all. This was just a bug in the matrix. Little did I know it was the structural ground of your own matrix. 

We had our first misunderstandings. We talked all night. Repaired. Or so I thought. Sometimes, love is difficult and you need to accept that you can hurt your favourite someone. But each misunderstanding was a stabbing to your love for me. An evidence that we were not compatible, no matter how small the matter was. 

You started to withdraw. I gave you space. You took the space and put it around you like a protective blanket. Sometimes you let me in, taking off the blanket, swallowing my warmth, until it felt like a burning furnace and put your blanket again. When we talked about it, you couldn't say a word. You were completely blocked. 

The discard came. You were anxious, although you could not explain why. Each discussion was the same : what is the issue? Is there something I do you dislike? No, you said. No, you are perfect. I just feel anxious all the time. Anxious to disappoint. Anxious to fight. But we fight very rarely, and we repair? I know, I know. I don't understand either. 

You left. I felt into the void. But I knew you'd be back. I knew I didn't dream the perfect compatibility. Who would abandon someone with whom they can talk and have sex a whole week without a break?

Four months passed. I rebuilt my life, although I knew that you would be back. You knew it too, you never gave up. So when I told you I needed to talk to you because I had a family crisis, you answered my call, and it lasted 7 hours. Greedily trying to catch up all that we had missed. Drinking water again. 

You asked for a 'coffee'. We both knew there would be one coffee, and four days in bed talking, constantly glued to each other. And it happened exactly like that, because it could not have happened otherwise. You heard my pain during these months, and you apologized, Cried in my arms. Admitted that you had lost your bestfriend and thought about me every day. 

You had started therapy. You wanted to heal so desperately. I supported you. I was so happy that you were in my life again. Finally, life made sense and I could breath again.

Yet, an uphill battle was awaiting. Each concert, each day out, each friendly gathering felt like a 'commitment'. You were so afraid to be depressed again, to be numb again. That's okay, we will take it slow. Whatever you need, baby. I'm here. 

Six months of CPR later, you broke up, a week after swearing that you really wanted to visit my family and stop this long distance thing. You repeated 10 times that you wanted this trip. I booked everything. Until you crashed, went to your therapist, and when you were back, you said 'I don't want this relationship. It's making me anxious and I can't do it. My therapist asked many times why I was anxious and I wanted to breakup. I don't know why. I just know it hurts' 

I cried, felt sorry for myself for 30 minutes, while you were coldly looking at me. And then, we drank coffee to enjoy every minute that remained before my train. 9 hours, where every second mattered. You were adamant on not sleeping. You wanted to enjoy each second. Until the end, you were aware of how much you loved me. But you did not show much emotions.

Until I hoped in the train, and you broke down. Cried and cried and cried, looking at me, dumbfounded. You couldn't stop crying. You even ran after the train. Cheesier than Bridget Jones, and yet you did that, after a night of not wanting to hug me. 

Since then, it's been icy. You don't talk. You avoid. You say you have 'nothing to take accountability for', despite breaking up right before my much-needed holidays and a trip I booked with care for you. 

I hope you're not feeling anxious anymore, because at least one of us should feel happier. Otherwise, it's all for nothing. 

I'm a shadow of my own self. You don't give a fuck. You removed me from your life and wake up everyday without me, as if that was completely normal. You used me, until the toy became stale and boring. ",8,1758034332.0,AvoidantBreakUps,3,1.0,False

Use the 6-part ""Nano-Banana"" prompt framework (Subject, Action, Environment, Style, Lighting, Details) to create stunning art. The real magic, though, is that Gemini's image tool is a secret Photoshop killer‚Äîyou can edit images with simple text prompts like ""change my hairstyle"" or ""restore this old photo."" Full guide and prompt examples below.**

I developed a simple framework - the **Nano-Banana Prompt method -** and it‚Äôs made Gemini my new go-to tool, especially for its great image editing capabilities.

# Part 1: The Anatomy of a Perfect ""Nano-Banana"" Prompt

The core idea is to treat your prompt like a recipe with six key ingredients. The more you include, the richer and more detailed your final image will be.

1. **Subject:** The main focus of your image. Don't just say ""a woman,"" say ""a young woman with freckles"" or ""a grizzled space marine.""
   * *Examples: 'a curious fox', 'a vintage red sports car', 'a powerful sorceress'*
2. **Action/Pose:** What is the subject doing? This brings life and dynamism to your image.
   * *Examples: 'running through a sun-dappled park', 'drifting around a hairpin turn', 'casting a complex spell'*
3. **Environment:** The scene or background. This sets the context and mood.
   * *Examples: 'in a futuristic cyberpunk cityscape', 'on a winding coastal highway at dusk', 'within a magical forest library'*
4. **Style:** The artistic style. This is crucial for getting the aesthetic you want.
   * *Examples: 'photorealistic, 8K', 'anime cel-shading', 'impressionistic watercolor painting', 'fantasy concept art'*
5. **Lighting:** The mood and type of light. This can dramatically alter the feeling of an image.
   * *Examples: 'soft golden hour light', 'dramatic neon lighting', 'eerie moonlight', 'harsh, direct midday sun'*
6. **Details & Attributes:** The special sauce. These are the unique features that make your image stand out.
   * *Examples: 'wearing a vintage leather jacket', 'with a blurred background (bokeh)', 'with intricate magical runes glowing on her hands'*

**Putting it all together, you go from a basic prompt like ""an elf"" to this:**

>

See the difference? Detail is everything.

# Part 2: The Secret Weapon - Gemini as an ""AI Photoshop""

This is where it gets truly mind-blowing. While tools like Midjourney are phenomenal for generating images from scratch, Gemini's ability to *edit* existing images with simple text prompts is a game-changer.

**How to Access it:**

1. Go to Gemini.
2. For a new image, just type your prompt.
3. For editing, click the paperclip or image icon to **upload your own photo**, then give it a text command. It's that simple.

Forget complex software. This is intuitive, powerful, and feels like magic.

# My Favorite Image-Editing Prompts (Case Studies)

Here are some of my favorite ways to use the editing feature. Upload a photo and try these:

**1. The Time Traveler: Restore Old Photos** Have a faded, black-and-white family photo? Upload it.

* **Prompt:** `""Restore this old, damaged photo. Please colorize it with realistic colors and improve the quality.""`
* **Result:** It will intelligently fill in cracks, remove blemishes, and apply historically plausible colors. It‚Äôs genuinely emotional to see old memories brought to life.

**2. The Stylist: Change Your Look** Want to try a new hairstyle or outfit without commitment?

* **Prompt:** `""Change my hairstyle in this photo to long, wavy blonde hair.""` or `""Change my blue t-shirt to a black leather jacket.""`
* **Result:** A surprisingly seamless way to experiment with your look.

**3. The Magician's Swap: Replace X with Y** This is incredibly powerful for fixing or enhancing photos.

* **Prompt:** `""Replace the coffee mug on the table with a small potted succulent.""` or `""Change the car on the left into a 1967 Chevrolet Impala.""`
* **Result:** A quick, targeted replacement that would take ages in traditional photo editors.

**4. The Vanishing Act: Object/Background Removal** Need to isolate a subject?

* **Prompt:** `""Remove the background completely, make it transparent.""` or `""Remove the person on the far right of the picture.""`
* **PS:** As the original image notes, dedicated tools like Canva or Photoshop are still sometimes more precise for professional work, but for a quick edit, this is unbeatable.

**5. The Sculptor: Isolate and Create** You can lift an object from one photo and use it as the basis for a new creation.

* **Prompt:** `""Extract the motorcycle from this picture, just the motorcycle.""`
* **Follow-up Prompt:** `""Place this motorcycle in a neon-lit garage. Make it an isometric 3D model.""`
* **Result:** This two-step process lets you create entire scenes and models from existing photo elements.

It's not just about generating pretty pictures; it's about a conversation with your art. It‚Äôs inspirational, educational, and honestly, just a ton of fun.

Packed into conveniently sized canisters, these lemon-scented antibacterial wipes make tackling household grime not only manageable but oddly satisfying at times. Whether it‚Äôs wiping down kitchen countertops after a messy cooking session or disinfecting bathroom handles and faucets, these TripleWeave textured wipes do a commendable job.

**Performance and Cleaning Efficiency**  
These wipes claim to clean three times better compared to using standard paper towels, and honestly, I‚Äôd have to agree with that. I used them to clean up an accidental coffee spill on my desk and was impressed by how effectively they handled both the sticky mess and the lingering residue. Beyond superficial spots, they‚Äôre also great for disinfecting. Clorox advertises that these wipes kill 99.9% of germs, including viruses like COVID-19, in just 15 seconds. While I can‚Äôt personally run lab tests to verify this claim, the fact that they‚Äôve been trusted by so many consumers makes me feel confident about their effectiveness.  

**Multi-Surface Compatibility**  
One of the standout aspects of this product is how versatile it is. From my sealed granite kitchen counters to the stainless steel appliances, the wipes worked beautifully without leaving streaks behind. I‚Äôve also used them on finished wood and in my car's interior for quick touch-ups, and they managed to clean thoroughly without damaging the surfaces.

[Check Clorox 10044600311811 price on Amazon.](https://review.sanue.com/p/b00hsc9f2c/)

**Packaging and Convenience**  
The canisters are convenient to store and straightforward to use. With 75 wipes in each pack and three canisters in total, there‚Äôs plenty to last through a decent number of clean-ups. However, I‚Äôll admit that pulling out individual wipes does require a touch of frustration as they occasionally stick together. Though not a deal-breaker, it‚Äôs enough to notice‚Äîespecially when you‚Äôre in a hurry to clean.  

**Scent and Residue**  
While these are marketed with a lemon scent, it‚Äôs not overwhelming, which works for me and might be a plus for others who dislike overpowering cleaning products. After using them, the surfaces I‚Äôve wiped down don‚Äôt have any waxy or greasy buildup, a feature I highly value because no one wants to clean twice just to remove product residue.  

**Pluses**  
- Cleans stubborn messes effectively.  
- Proven to kill viruses and bacteria, promoting hygienic spaces.  
- Versatile use on multiple non-porous surfaces.  

**Caveats**  
- Occasionally challenging to dispense wipes individually.  
- Primarily effective on hard surfaces‚Äîless so on fabric.  

**Rival Brands**  
When contrasting these wipes with competitors like Lysol Disinfecting Wipes, Clorox seems to have the edge in multi-surface compatibility, especially with delicate surfaces like finished wood. On the other hand, Lysol wipes have a slightly stronger scent, which some might perceive as more ‚Äúdisinfecting.‚Äù I‚Äôve also tried store-brand antibacterial wipes, but they tend to be thinner and less durable, needing more than one wipe for tasks that Clorox can tackle with just a single sheet. Still, it‚Äôs worth noting that the competition often comes at a slightly lower cost, for those looking to save money.  

**Cost Efficiency**  
While these are not the cheapest disinfecting wipes on the market, they justify their price by balancing longevity, performance, and multi-surface use. In my opinion, the durability and cleaning power of each wipe make them far more efficient than cheaper alternatives, which tend to feel flimsy and less reliable.

1nijifh,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1nijifh/can_the_moon_cycles_affect_your_anxiety/,Can the moon cycles affect your anxiety?,"First of all I am not asking for a medical advice, I just want to know if there are people in the same situation? And also sorry for the long post. I would post the Tldr at the end of this.

So from monday, 8 September, i had problem breathing, felt like I no matter how much i inhale, there is still little room there and somehow chest pressure and numbness in my left arm. 
I worked through a very hard and stressful program especially for the last 2 months, almost 12 hours daily and I didn‚Äôt really eat properly, mostly only pizza and french fries, and also coffee  everyday, around. 2-3 espresso. ( this happened in July and August, this program).

But from September I started taking it more slowly, started sleeping regularly and work was more chill. Still, monday the 8, i took some days off because i didn‚Äôt felt better. On Tuesday I arrived at the hospital, my symptoms were shortness of breath, chest pain and numbness in my left arm, also I couldn‚Äôt stand up. 
At the hospital I had an episode of hypocalcemia.
All the test and analysis were good, everything was on parameters and when I described it to the doctor it says those are just panic attacks and nothing that could put my life at risk. Still from the last tuesday up until now the symptoms are still there‚Ä¶. It seems like those 2 days i am a little better, but still i felt like i can‚Äôt get out of bed, no energy, I can‚Äôt stand for more than 15 minutes at the desk because again I felt all the symptoms coming back.

I would go to a psychotherapuet this week to also talk with it about those symptoms. But I was just scrolling random through social media and found a post that talked about this ‚Äúblood moon‚Äù on September 7 and how it could affect your anxiety and behavior. Oddly enough after reading more about the subject I saw a lot of people sharing their similarities in comments, and of course that I was intrigued and I am thinking to take this into account as well. Astrology saying all the feeling and things that I kept inside me and not shared now ressurfec, and that this period your body goes through a transformation, leaving everything bad ( patterns, karma, person) behind you. 

So yes, I am wondering if moon cycles can affect and increase your anxiety and panic attacks and are people in similar conditions? 


Tldr: starting from September 7 when there was the moon cycles I start having severe panic attacks, shortness of breath and chest pressure. All the analysis are good, so I am wondering if the causes can be spiritually and could moon cycles affect and increase your anxiety and panic attacks?

My partner and I have gotten into some heated arguments over this, and its starting to get frustrating for me. I have been a barista for 3 years, and the only way i have seen cold brew properly made is the traditional method. You tie up the beans into a bag and throw it in a jar and let it soak overnight. 

Well, my partner insists on us using this bodum cold brew press maker. I have been the one tasked with making the cold brew, and I cant seem to make it right. I grind up the beans to a course grind, and then do about a 1:8 proportion of coffee to water. I let them sit 24 hours, then press it down, and serve over ice. The cold brew never tastes like a coffee shops cold brew. It always taste more similar to iced coffee, in a bad way. I dont know how to explain it other than that. 

Does anyone have any suggestions, or could list out their entire process for me if they use a similar press method? This product just confuses me since it is not what I am used to. I want to make good tasting cold brew!",2,1758033618.0,coldbrew,13,1.0,False
1nijc22,https://www.reddit.com/r/BandonDunes/comments/1nijc22/single_day_trip_report_september_2025/,Single Day Trip Report September 2025,"I‚Äôve seen a lot of Bandon trip reports where folks have done the full multi-day trip staying on site, etc. but not as much info about smaller scale day trips so thought I‚Äôd share my recent experience. First off, to get this out of the way, if you‚Äôre on the fence at all, just go. It‚Äôs every bit as incredible as you‚Äôve heard, and then some.

For any sort of advice in this post I‚Äôm going to assume you‚Äôre going as a single or twosome and only playing one day.

**Planning**

I was arriving in Portland on Monday mid day and had work in Medford on Wednesday so I ended up with a free day on Tuesday more or less in the area. Called the reservations line about a month out, as soon as I‚Äôd decided to give this trip a try. I needed a morning tee time and you can only make tee times before 10:00 AM 21 days out as a non resort guest. In my case they didn‚Äôt have lodging available, but Debbie in reservations gave me the current golf availability (plenty) and offered to call me up at 6:00 AM pacific 21 days out from my trip so we could have the most options.

Sure enough, 21 days from my trip I got the call from Debbie at 6:00 AM pacific time. I just asked her to tell me the earliest availability at each of the courses. There were times at Bandon Dunes, Trails, and Old Mac all before 9:00. I went with 7:20 at Bandon Dunes since that was the earliest they had. In hindsight I should have gone ahead and booked an afternoon time right then as well, but I wasn‚Äôt sure I was going to have time for the second round due to potential Tuesday evening work commitments so I left that open.

**Drive from Portland/Lodging/Bandon Town**

Arrived in Portland and was on the road by noon with no concrete plans. I knew I couldn‚Äôt make it to Bandon in time for a full round and (maybe this was a mistake) the short courses as a single just didn‚Äôt seem like the play. Instead I made a stop off at Woodburn Golf club about an hour south of PDX. What a cool, unique experience. Put $10 in a drop box, and play the 9 hole course with sand greens. During my loop I only saw one other person there. Totally different vibe, but I'm glad I made the stop.

Since there wasn‚Äôt anything available on site I booked a room in town at Bandon. I ended up staying at the b.side motel. It‚Äôs a pretty nicely updated old school motel, was about $150 for the night and 10 minutes door to door from the main clubhouse at Bandon Dunes. There are other options in Bandon and seemed to be plenty of availability in early September. It was raining and dark by the time I arrived so I didn't see much of Old Town Bandon or the beach there. 

**Golf**

Got to the main clubhouse at Bandon Dunes about 6:30 for my 7:20 tee time. By the time I figured out where to park and checked in and got a free coffee it was about 6:45 which didn‚Äôt really leave enough time to get over to range to warm up. The practice center is about a 5 minute drive from Bandon Dunes. Should have arrived a little earlier to have enough time. Instead I putted on the absolutely massive practice green and let the anticipation build.

First round at Bandon Dunes, there are millions of reviews elsewhere so i won‚Äôt go into details on the course itself. I will say in the dawn light with a slight mist in the air, it was absolutely magical. I was grinning ear to ear the whole time, even while taking a 9 on hole 16 - If you‚Äôre going for that top fairway you better hit it - being in the waste area that separates the two fairway sections is a death sentence. I didn‚Äôt take a caddie for either round, and I think that ended up being the right move for a ‚Äúbudget‚Äù trip like this. For both rounds, the others I was paired with did have caddies and I got to benefit from listening in to their advice on tee shots and they tended the flags, and told stories about the courses and experiences there. I didn‚Äôt ask for any putting lines or anything but got some information just by being within earshot. After both rounds I ended up tipping them $20 for the free advice.

Wrapped up the round in a slight drizzle at around 11:30 and immediately went into the Bandon Dunes pro shop to see what my options were for a second round. I didn‚Äôt end up having any work obligations but even if I did I think I would have had to make up an excuse, no way I was leaving without another round. At that time they had Pacific and Trails both at 2:30ish and Old Mac at 1:10. Old Mac was the bottom of my list of courses I wanted to try but that time worked a lot better for me so I decided to give it a go.

While I preferred Bandon Dunes, the course I‚Äôm finding myself thinking about more afterwards is Old Mac and I‚Äôm dying for another round there. There are so many shots and so many holes where I just feel like I really want another chance at. For example, #8, the Biarritz hole, I left my tee shot a little short and right so I didn‚Äôt get to see the ball roll through the valley to a back pin. I want to play #3 a little more left towards the ghost tree to see where the ball would end up, etc. #3 fairway is the wildest fairway I‚Äôve ever seen btw. All in all, I don‚Äôt think you really can go wrong with any course.

**Cost**

all in was around $850 not counting any travel expenses. That‚Äôs for hotel, two rounds in peak season, breakfast and lunch + snacks at the resort, $40 for tips for other peoples caddies. It was well worth it. I still can‚Äôt believe a place like this exists. I‚Äôm hopeful one day I can do the proper multi-day on-site trip but for now, if I ever find myself in the area again I‚Äôll definitely find an excuse to return for another visit.

Hi everyone,


 I am 35M, and from Northamptonshire, East Midlands, England. I am looking to make new genuine long-term friends and friendships, and ideally it would be great to meet people to hang out with regularly in person, as well as chat on text/ phone/video call etc.

As a person, I would describe myself as someone who is friendly, sociable, outgoing, and patient, whilst also being a caring and respectful person.

In terms of my interests and hobbies, I enjoy playing sports (I regularly play badminton, squash and table tennis), workout at the gym and do cardio/weights; socialising and going out to pubs, clubs and restaurants, watching movies (my favourite film genre is horror films); listening to music (pop, R&B, rock, indie, classical etc); gaming (I like playing PlayStation).

I also like visiting museums; and travelling and sightseeing; learning new languages and cultures; cooking; going out for coffees etc; reading history and literature and non-fiction; and playing other games like snooker/pool and bowling etc.

Whilst I am very open and happy to make new friends from international countries and I am open to long distance friendships, it would equally be great to make new friends in the UK or Britain (and preferably in nearby regions to me like London, West Midlands, East Midlands etc) to meet up and hang out with in person also. Ideally looking to make friends in the 25-40 age range (mid-late 20s, 30s and 40s - or similar ages to me).

In any case, if anyone shares the same or similar interests/hobbies to me, and feels like we may get on and would like to build a new friendship together, please feel free to message or DM me anytime. I would be very happy to connect and chat with you. üôÇ

1nij3ix,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuiltToTest/comments/1nij3ix/explore_the_best_countertop_dishwasher_hava_tdqr/,Explore the best countertop dishwasher HAVA TDQR and see if it fits,"I‚Äôve had the chance to spend some hands-on time with the HAVA TDQR countertop dishwasher, and I‚Äôve got to say, it‚Äôs been an absolute game-changer in my kitchen routine. Between a small, cramped apartment and a somewhat chaotic schedule, traditional full-sized dishwashers were a no-go for me. This compact dishwasher offered a convenient solution without the need for major installations. The first time I loaded it up and hit the start button, I knew it was going to save me both time and effort.

**Compact Design and Build Quality**

The sleek, glossy finish of this compact dishwasher not only looks good sitting on the countertop but feels well-constructed too. Measuring just 16.9 x 16.8 x 18.1 inches, it manages to fit right into tight spaces like apartments or RV kitchens. Despite its small footprint, it holds up to four full place settings. I was pleasantly surprised when I managed to fit a couple of saucepans and plates alongside cutlery in one load! It‚Äôs lightweight too, weighing just 28.6 pounds, making it easy to move around when needed.

[Check HAVA TDQR price on Amazon.](https://vendm.com/p/b0915x4bbp/)

**Performance and Cleaning Efficiency**

What struck me immediately was the cleaning performance. With 14 water ports on the spray arms, it provides 360-degree thorough cleaning. My dishes came out spotless even on the speed cycle, including stained coffee cups and greasy pans. Plus, it uses just 5 liters of water per cycle, making it significantly more water-efficient compared to handwashing. I‚Äôve started to feel a little smug about being environmentally friendlier these days!

**Positives**

- Supports two water supply modes (built-in water tank or faucet connection)
- Multiple cycle choices including Speed, Heavy, Baby Care, and more
- Energy-efficient, consuming only 950 Wh per cycle
- Compact yet spacious design that accommodates a surprising amount of kitchenware

**Special Features**

If you‚Äôve got little ones, the Baby Care mode is worth highlighting. It heats up to 167¬∞F, safely cleaning baby bottles and other items. I gave this feature a go after cooking something especially greasy, and it worked wonders on the stubborn stains as well. Plus, the built-in drying function is a personal favorite, with 60 minutes of hot air drying followed by 72 hours of ventilation. No more damp plates or lingering odors!

**Areas of Concern**

Like most products, there are a couple of things I noticed that could be tweaked:

- The outlet hose length felt a little short for flexibility.
- It doesn‚Äôt hold oversized dishes well, so mixing large and small items can be tricky.
- Operations, while straightforward, require specific dishwasher detergents‚Äîforgetting this gave me a sudsy first day!

**Competing Products**

Having tried compact dishwashers before, it‚Äôs clear the HAVA TDQR stands out in convenience and efficiency. Compared to other brands like Farberware or Danby, this model edges ahead with its built-in water tank and hot air drying feature. On the other hand, competitors may offer slightly more capacity for larger households. If you have a small family or live alone, the HAVA TDQR is pretty tough to beat.

**Quality for Price**

Speaking frankly, this product offers a lot for its price tag. Between the energy savings, efficient water usage, and sheer amount of time it saves me daily, it‚Äôs worth every penny. Some might balk at investing in a countertop model, but given the features and build quality, it‚Äôs a practical choice that delivers long-term value.

I used to dread talking to strangers. Even small interactions like ordering coffee, saying hi to a neighbor, all felt terrifying. I‚Äôd overthink every word, freeze in conversations, and leave feeling embarrassed.

Then I realized something: social skills aren‚Äôt magic, they‚Äôre habits. Every interaction, no matter how small, is like a mini workout for your confidence.

 The more you practice connecting with strangers, the easier it becomes,and the more positive and resilient you feel naturally.

Here‚Äôs what helped me most:

1. Start small, intentionally. Compliment a stranger, ask a simple question, or make a casual comment in line. These tiny ‚Äúwins‚Äù add up fast.


2. Focus on curiosity, not performance. Stop trying to be witty or impressive. Ask questions, listen actively, and engage with genuine interest.


3. Reflect and iterate. After interactions, think: what felt good? What could I improve next time? Progress happens in small steps.



I promise, this works. After a few days or weeks  of consistent effort, social interactions feel effortless. You don‚Äôt just get better at talking ,you become more confident, positive, and comfortable in your own skin.

I‚Äôm curious:

What‚Äôs the smallest social interaction that completely changed your confidence?

**Techniques to fight procrastination:**

1. **The 5-Minute Rule.**¬†Promise yourself you‚Äôll study for just five minutes. Often, that‚Äôs enough to get started.
2. **Break tasks into steps.**¬†Instead of ‚Äúprepare for the exam,‚Äù think: ‚Äúread three pages and take notes.‚Äù
3. **Use rewards.**¬†After a block of studying, treat yourself (a coffee, a short walk, one episode of a show).
4. **Remove temptations.**¬†Put your phone in another room and block distracting apps.

**Why it works:**

* Procrastination comes from the fear of big tasks. Small steps feel doable and reduce stress.
* Rewards create positive associations with studying.
* Fewer distractions mean fewer chances to slip.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I've had stomach issues for over a year now.

Stomach bloating, evening only diarrhoea (i fast through the day and drink only coffee, until dinner) and dry mouth (normal HBA1C and negative SSA/SSB for Sjogrens).

Deficient in Vitamin D as well as B12 (normal folate, however). Supplementing both in liquid form as pills don't do anything, which links to my malabsorption issues.

I did a gut dysbiosis test and it ruled out H.Pylori, candida, etc. Oral swab on my tongue ruled out thrush, despite enlarged papillae trapping bacteria (i use a tongue scraper daily.

It only revealed low stool PH value, low E.coli, sIGA and biffido bacterium. Since quitting completely alcohol, junk food and supplementing with s boullardi, prebiotics, l-glutamyne and bifido prebiotic, my bloating has reduced, but i still have stool issues. My morning stool is light brown and loose and has undigested food. Especially vegetables and banana chunks don't seem to get digested.

The stool also sometimes smells like I'm ill with the flu. No smelly gas or gas in general.

I also did a lactulose SIBO breath test and it came back negative for hydrogen and methane SIBO. The results show a normal flatline for both. 8ppm for Hydrogen and fluctuating line around 5 ppm for methane.

I did some research and ran it through ChatGPT and it said the flatline of hydrogen and methane may indicate H‚ÇÇS SIBO instead. I am not entirely convinced, as i don't have frequent flatulence or egg-smelling gas.

The problem is I am in the UK and here it's extremely difficult to push for referrals or get any help from GP's, especially for gut issues. The most they do are stool test and any gut issues they usually pinpoint to IBS and send you your way.

I really want to fix my gut and the pre/probiotic regime i am doing has definitely helped in reducing the bloating and improving my dry mouth (I plan on adding lactobacilus GG, followed by 299v).

I just want to get answers.

I also like visiting museums; and travelling and sightseeing; learning new languages and cultures; cooking; going out for coffees etc; reading history and literature and non-fiction; and playing other games like snooker/pool and bowling etc.

Whilst I am very open and happy to make new friends from international countries and I am open to long distance friendships, it would equally be great to make new friends in the UK or Britain (and preferably in nearby regions to me like London, West Midlands, East Midlands etc) to meet up and hang out with in person also.

let's talk about cleaning IPA - yet again. There are many videos and threads from people who seem to have found the holy grail of cleaning IPA. I tried a few things already but nothing works really well and it's quite frustrating. I am using Sunlu ABS like resin.

1. Let IPA settle over multiple days, cure the stuff at the bottom and use the IPA on top of it

\-> Doesn't work for me. As soon as I cure it, the whole IPA gets grey and cloudy even tho is was clear before.



2. Pour it through fabric, for example cotton towels

\-> Doesn't change the grey color for me, although a lot of resin chunks remain in the fabric



3. Pour it through a coffee filter

\-> Works more or less fast, but doesn't change the grey color for me



4. Stacking 2 buckets with a ceramic dome filter and let gravity do the work

\-> works for me at the beginning, but after a few hours or so, it slows down until nothing gets through it anymore. I guess it's either not enough weight anymore to push the IPA through the filter or the filter is clogged quite quickly. Maybe a pump is needed to suck the IPA through the filter but I didn't find any suitable yet that fits into the system



5. Building a system with a pump, tubes with UV LEDs wrapped around and 2 different filters

\-> Too much effort for me, or more specifically: I don't have that much room for something like this. Also it's quite expensive



6. Distilling

\-> Seems to be the only reliable way of doing it, but it's still too dangerous for me. Also I don't have a safe space to do it in or around my home because I don't own a house



So what am I doing wrong? Am I waiting for too long before I clean it? Is it maybe due to the resin (I read somewhere that different resins can behave differently)? I really would like to deal with this last piece of frustration. Oh and by the way, I am using a ""2 step washing"" workflow - I dump the prints into IPA and swirl it around a little, then I put it into my washing station tank.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

When I started with specialty coffee 2 years ago, I didn't even consider what types of beans I wanted to use. I bought the Profitec Go with a Eureka Mignon Specialit√† and pretty soon I preferred light and medium-light roasts. Shots were good and mediocre, but to be honest: I never really got rid of an unpleasant astringency in almost all my shots. Maybe because I'm pretty sensitive to those polyphenols, maybe because I didn't dial in right or maybe because of the burrs in de Specialit√†; I still don't really know.

After I went to La Cabra, Arhus in Denmark this summer and tasted a very nice light roast espresso, I wanted to give my hunt for beautiful espresso at home a final chance. After some thorough research, the choice was between the Zerno Z1, Mazzer Philos and P64. With import tariffs and waiting time with the Zerno, unavailability of the P64, the choice was easily made for the Mazzer Philos with i200d burrs.

After a few days with my new pal, my shots are notably better. Less bitterness/astringency and with definitely more clarity and flavour separation. The Philos is a pleasure to work with. Robust, no retention, well made and excellent grounds. I haven't brewed a v60 yet, but I'm looking forward to a comparison with my trusty ZP6.

It seems like I'm gonna make espresso's at home for years to come. BUT, if I somehow stay disappointed, I'm either gonna lower my expectations and enjoy 'good' shots more (addressed by the post earlier today), or I'm gonna sell those machines, keep my ZP6 and just use the v60 for the rest of my life.
