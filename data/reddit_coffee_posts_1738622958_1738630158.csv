We are friends and I just expressed my feelings to her,"TLDR: Alright, its going to be a long one and I need your suggestions as I am completely out of my mind. 

We two met each other last year around May and was introduced by a common friend. The moment I saw her, I had a crush on her. Skip a couple months, we started doing trips together just us, going to coffee shops, hot chocolates etc. She also started enjoying my company she said that. I do drive her around here and there quite a few times a month. We meet every week with our group for coffee catchup. We both actually felt the warmth and became very good friends in a short span of time. Started liking the company. I started LIKING her A LOT every single day. 

She is a very good person, and looking for a long-term in fact permanent committed relationship. She's humble, loyal, down-to-earth, matured and a very happy-go-lucky girl. Whenever i look into her eyes, i feel a kind of spark and feel something. I love when she opens her hair, she looks so pretty. Her smile is very unique, i haven't really saw anything like that. I am an introvert guy, silent, less talkative. And she's completely opposite. Extroverted, talkative, excellent story telling skills. I was actually looking for a such a person who is completely opposite than me. I value the differences and I feel if we have that, we can create unique experiences every single day. Whenever I am around her, it feels like something connects, and something fits. We started spend good amount of time together, went on road trips, shopping, grocery shopping, etc. 

With all these influx of emotions, I decided to finally let her know last week. She loves watching stars so I decided to take her to a place in the night out of the city lights, for stargazing. Enjoyed the drive, and spend the time watching stars. I had her hot chocolate and we shared good moment sipping the hot chocolate. I got a feeling that it is the right time to let her know, I told her can i ask you something. I then went ahead and asked if we could go on a date together. She took a pause and told why do we wanna ruin the friendship we have together. And she told me to let her know what everything is going in my mind. I let her know every single thing I felt, that how much I like her and how much she means everything to me, how much her company means to me. Every single thing. 

This is what she said. Heads up, it didn't turn in my favor. She thinks she is not ready for it and when i confessed my feelings to her, she kind of little freaked out. ""Not ready"" is a strong word, but she's not in a state to do this. She said she has a past trauma, and its so bad that it keeps coming in intervals and she had it recently where she breaks down and reaches him. She feels this void and want to focus on herself atm. With all this going around, she won't be able to give the love i need. She's currently ""empty"" - referring to a glass. And even if she ignores, and come with me , it won't be genuine. I felt her pain in her eyes while she was explaining this. I told her I am not in a state to rush, i wanna take baby-steps and i am ready to wait. Because that's what love is right, you wait and don't rush. I told her I don't have any expectations, I just wanna give you love and we can deal this shit together. I will make sure to give you a lot. But, she said for how long will i wait, she's not sure how long it will be and its not a good idea to keep me holding. Told me move on, go on other hinge dates, eventually you will find someone who's ready to ""give"" and not just receive. 

After hearing all this, it killed me inside. I cried the shit out of me after returning. This sucks a LOTTT. The thing is, for the first time, i never felt irritated or angry or feel like punching when she explained. Instead, I felt at peace and calm. Only thing is I am hurt a lottt, feeling like someone tore the book out in between. My love for her is genuine and I don't wanna give up on her. I want to take her out of the feeling she is going. I don't feel like giving up because for all that I know, she's worth it. Its rare to find a person like her with good human, heart and behavior and i do have the feeling of keeping her. 

Please guys help me, is it worth waiting for her? I need some suggestions.",1,1738629740.0,relationships,0,1.0,False

I am seeking representation for my 105,000-word adult fantasy novel FRAYMOON. It mingles bizarre magic with both low and god-level tech on a world which may once have been our own.¬†

Even before she opens her eyes, Amihan knows her baby, Hintua, is gone, and something has been left behind. There is a faint metal smell, a bitter thread, in her sweetest thing. Nursing the hateful doll, she decides. She will go to the Fell Mountain, where the ‚Äògood neighbors‚Äô are said to live, and where they¬†surely have Hintua. She will have to travel the world, and scale the peak, a blade rearing into airless black‚Äîthough she has never been away from home.

Robbing her in-laws of the faceted jet discs that are the makings of magic, and her great-uncle of his tools for fighting monsters, she sets off, hiding in the jungle. She is attacked by a blood-demon, Leofsige, a beautiful thing, and compels him to her service with the tools. They are joined by her childhood best friend,¬†Liantaika,¬†who has escaped his brutal master and stolen all his charms, including the atsar bombs that can break the world.

¬†With their help she leaves the tropics, traversing cursed millet fields and bamboo cities lashed to the sides of ancient spanbridges. She avenges a mother-ghost by burning a tower of mahogany built without a single nail. FRAYMOON is both picaresque, and has a steel core of purpose: a mother‚Äôs desire for her lost child. Every uncanny obstacle they pass brings her closer to her goal.

The wizards of the Great Academies, desperate to regain the charms¬†Liantaika stole, launch ever more violent onslaughts. These attacks are terrifying yet sometimes comical, as charms‚Äîdifferent from the pure spells powered by the discs‚Äîare strange and idiosyncratic. Amihan comes near death being scalded in coffee with condensed milk. After a year of travels, and a terrible sacrifice, they come to the Mountain. But it is something impossibly different than they imagined, and Hintua is a changed thing also. Even the world is not as they thought.

Readers of Kelly Link, particularly¬†*White Cat, Black Dog*¬†but also¬†*The Book of Love*,¬†will appreciate the fairy-tale elements made radically anew, while Fraymoon shares with T. Kingfisher‚Äôs¬†*Nettle and Bone*¬†the true strangeness of magic. Reaching into classic fantasy, this is the world of Gene Wolfe and Jack Vance.¬†

I am a late-in-life first time author, a Savannah native who has lived half my life in Singapore after studying classics, linguistics, and ancient philosophy at Columbia and Berkeley. I have published some flash fiction and a coming story. FRAYMOON can be read alone but has strong series potential.

While interest wasn‚Äôt huge, we landed on **TOP r/nordvpn community recommendations**.¬†

We thought a community-driven guide would be a great way to share troubleshooting tips for common issues.¬†

Today, we are opening this new series of posts with **CONNECTION ISSUES**.

Whether you were dealing with slow speeds, failed connections, or VPN blocks and found a solid solution, this thread is for you to share your know-how with the community. 

I‚Äôll go first! If you are using NordVPN in a coffee shop, on any other free Wi-Fi network, or in a location with network restrictions, try switching to TCP + [Obfuscated servers](https://nordvpn.com/features/obfuscated-servers/) in the NordVPN app and connect to the nearest server to your actual location. Some networks block VPN traffic, but obfuscated servers help disguise it, making it harder to detect.¬†

It might be a bit slower than UDP, but it‚Äôs more reliable in places with strict network restrictions. It helped me many times when dealing with firewalls or public Wi-Fi.¬†

Also, I have to admit that I‚Äôm pretty impressed with the [NordWhisper](https://nordvpn.com/blog/nordwhisper-protocol/) protocol. For those who aren‚Äôt aware yet, this is NordVPN‚Äôs new protocol designed for situations like this. Since it‚Äôs still relatively new, I‚Äôm still testing it but so far, so good.

I love fancier teas, too, and have dozens, but Lipton was how I got my daily water.

There were a few people here in the same boat so I wanted to check in to share my substitutes and see how others are faring. I started with steeping iced green tea in an iced coffee maker overnight but that left me sometimes pushing myself to drink a lot before bed so I could have a full carafe waiting in the morning as opposed to one cup in the morning and then waiting for it to steep again.

I don't think I need to explain why drinking a bunch of tea right before bed posed a problem. 

Now I do the above but I also augment it with one of those decaf iced-tea-by-the-pitcher things (the kind that use a GIANT tea bag). 99% of the time, if one is running low, the other is already steeping or ready to go. So there's always something. 

What I'm using is generally just cheap store brands or close to it, but it keeps water from tasting like water. I'm actually enjoying playing around with my green tea in the iced tea/coffee maker. Right now, I'm using four green tea bags with one Prince of Peace pu-erh to give it some earthiness. I've used one flavored green tea at times, as well.

BEWARE ‚Ä¶ I was thrilled with my Zojirushi Stainless Steel Mug, Cherry, 16 Ounce mug I purchased on Amazon 13 months ago. My spouse was gifted the 'same' one over 5 yrs ago & I kept stealing it as it only one that would keep my coffee hot for well over 8 hrs! So I was happy to buy one - just for me in bright pink - that performed the same ... until a month ago. 

What started as a puzzling mystery in January has now become a major health concern. My zojirushi stainless mug (ASIN B072X4LWNV) started shedding these thin black pieces that look plastic or tape - small & large shreds I would literally take out of my mouth & place on napkin to look at & take pics. They were felt & ingested only when I finished drinking the last few gulps left in cup. This progressively got worse over a few weeks & after a thorough process of elimination, we  used a flashlight to see inside & found a horrifying black bumpy surface all over the sides & bottom of cup! I am worried as to what hazard I was consuming over the last month! Cup is NOT Stainless steel - BEWARE! No, it is not coffee grounds, mold, or coming off the lid or gaskets. The cup is used & cleaned daily. We have another of these same stainless mugs (same manufacturer name & same ‚Äòmodel‚Äô) that has been used daily for over 5 years now & perfectly fine - only difference is it came from the high-end Hammacher Schlemmer catalogue. They no longer carry it - to no surprise. These 'shards' continue to come off - by just shaking some water inside, more & more ‚Äòshards‚Äô keep leaching off the cups inner walls - every single time. What was at first thought to be a fluke soon became a BIG problem. What poison could I have been consuming - for who knows how long - before actual evidence presented itself. I contacted Amazon to alert them - where I purchased I purchased it - & they urged me to share my review. Additionally, after a few google searches I am finding other reports of this & also that the company uses nickel & also contains a cancer warning! ",1,1738628371.0,zojirushi,1,1.0,False

I am slowly decorating my new home, and I am having trouble with this odd shaped foyer area. I know it needs art, lighting and maybe a rug; but I think I need to figure out the furniture configuration first.

I have a larger mirror opposite the stairs; and I'd like to add a seating area to the right of the mirror/bottom-right corner.

Do you think three chairs (with a smaller round coffee table/cocktail table) or two larger chairs (with side table in between, in the corner) are better? Or should I get a small couch/settee?

Attached are photos of both options with chairs I happen to have but I can purchase something different.

Color scheme I'm leaning towards is white neutrals, muted greens and some black highlights.

The dining room area has light wood (birch?) vintage dining set (which I'm keeping), white upholstered chairs (which I'm not married to), and a rug that I'll eventually replace). 

I appreciate any suggestions on furniture placement, type and colors, etc. Thank you!",2,1738627608.0,interiordecorating,1,1.0,False

I just want to take a moment to share something that‚Äôs been on my heart lately: the importance of supporting local businesses and standing up for the people in our community‚Äîespecially those who don‚Äôt always get a fair shake. There are so many incredible spots around town‚Äîfamily-run restaurants, cafes built on love and hard work, shops where creativity thrives, and breweries that genuinely care about the people who walk through their doors. These places aren‚Äôt just businesses; they‚Äôre the heart and soul of Fort Collins. When we support them, we help create jobs, foster creativity, and keep our money right here, building a stronger community for all of us. But here's the thing: it‚Äôs not just about where we spend our money. It's about standing up for workers‚Äîmaking sure people are paid fairly and treated with dignity. There are places out there that don‚Äôt value their employees the way they should, and that needs to change. One of the best ways to push for that change is to support businesses that do right by their workers. Community is everything. In a world that seems to get a little crazier every day, we need to stand up for each other and protect what makes this place special (in some cases make it better). Let‚Äôs reject the forces that try to divide us‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs greed, hate, or those who want to control everything without giving back. Together, we can create a city that values fairness, kindness, and opportunity for everyone. Let‚Äôs explore the amazing places around us. Find those hidden gems. Share your favorites. Add to this list. Who knows what incredible spots you‚Äôll discover when you step off the beaten path? We‚Äôre all in this together, and every choice we make can build a better, more inclusive, and stronger Fort Collins. Let‚Äôs make this community a beacon of what‚Äôs possible when people care for each other. I'll get the list started of places you can support and check out.

First, the excellent news: I'm getting married in June! Planning the wedding has been a wonderful respite from, you know, the horrors of our everyday life, and also a chance to invest in a look that makes me feel amazing. I had a custom suit made from Bindle & Keep, and I'm now on the hunt for a pair of dress shoes to go with it.

  
I have smallish feet (I typically wear a women's size 8, or a junior boy's 6.5). I had high hopes for [these Oxfords](https://thursdayboots.com/products/mens-dress-shoe-chairman-cinnamon) from Thursday Boot Company, because I've bought shoes from them before, but they're just way too big.

  
Anyone have any recs? I'm currently looking at [Tomboy Toes](https://www.tomboytoes.com/collections/genuine-leather/products/the-wingtip-commanders-in-coffee-brown), but I'm a little disappointed in the one style that they have available in real leather. (I find that vegan leather just isn't very durable; it tends to crinkle, because it is, well, plastic.)

1ih3ybv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1ih3ybv/possible_acute_gastritis_but_i_have_questions/,possible acute gastritis but I have questions.,"I'm going to start off by saying my symptoms started on a day where I had WAY too much coffee and had been eating spicy chips nearly every day. I know these were my mistakes and most likely what brought all this on.

I've been very stressed, anxious and depressed, and unfortunately I live with the cause of said feelings and can't really do anything about it besides holing myself up in my room, where I had snacks to comfort me. Main reason for my overconsumption of the junk food.

I'm 22, F, and it started with immediate nausea. I have emetophobia, so I did everything I could not to vomit. Still haven't, but the nausea comes and goes. I made sure everything was coming out the other way.

I'm on day 11 of not feeling like myself and I'm wondering at what stage I might be at or if there's any advice you can give me.

I was prescribed Zofran for the nausea and only took it twice because my nausea didn't go away and it made me dizzy/not feel right. Ended up going to Urgent Care on day 6 and spoke to a different doctor and was prescribed Pepcid (pill) and Mylanta (liquid). She mentioned gastritis but I didn't get a chance to ask more about it. I was told to take both every day and I did it for 2 days but still felt weird at the end of the night. I find that just taking the liquid an hour or so before eating makes me feel better and I've been doing that for a few days.

I have also been dealing with constipation every day, which is a side effect of the meds, but it also makes me nauseous because I feel backed up and bloated.

Now, on day 11, I'm feeling somewhat normal and although I haven't been eating as much, I'm trying to eat smaller, healthier meals. My google search history is a mess of me trying to figure out if this is acute gastritis and if I'll be feeling like myself again any time soon.

This is all very new to me and a bit overwhelming, and I would just really like some feedback and advice from people who know what this is like :( Sorry it's such a long post.

I‚Äôve never posted in here before, I‚Äôve lurked for the past few months, especially since the election ramped up and she continued to stay silent. I started following her during the divorce, I liked the perspective she shared. I still enjoy putting on her content when I‚Äôm doing housework or getting ready, it‚Äôs mindless escapism for a few minutes when I want to unplug from reality. 

I watched her comeback video today and took notes on the points that stuck out to me. I figured I‚Äôd share them here for those who don‚Äôt want to watch the full video. This video feels pretty insensitive to post given the current state of the country. If she had said something even alluding to it, whatever, it‚Äôs her typical content. But this was planned, she knew exactly when she would come back, she knew it would be 2 weeks post Trump‚Äôs inauguration. It would be naive to assume he wouldn‚Äôt cause the uproar that he has, it‚Äôs exactly what he did last time. Even from purely a content perspective, you‚Äôd think she would‚Äôve considered that. 

It‚Äôs interesting how she brought up how her content does better when her life is going worse for her. Like that sucks, but at least there is an upside, you‚Äôre making more money. Most people still have to work their regular job and struggle to pay bills when their life isn‚Äôt going great, which can suffer if you‚Äôre not doing well, leading to loss of income. 

She spoke about the nail salon accent thing. What bugged me was she never admitted to needing to do better or how something she did could be racist, she just basically was like ‚Äúthat‚Äôs their opinion‚Äù and centered herself rather than marginalized communities who she unintentionally harmed. She seems to think that if she‚Äôs being ‚Äúreal and raw‚Äù there will be no consequences, and if they are it‚Äôs because she‚Äôs a creator and not because everyone faces consequences for their words and actions no matter who they are.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs being rewarded or being punished based off of the feedback that I get‚Äù that quote stuck out to me because that‚Äôs literally every job?

She‚Äôs so focused on being her real self online when it is her job. Nobody is their full 100% most authentic self at their job, there are boundaries.

She also floats between ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a business, this is my job‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a human being, not a business‚Äù whenever it‚Äôs convenient for her. In this video alone she used both of contradictions to assist her talking point. She talked about the fires and made it seem like she had to release a statement. I don‚Äôt think anyone was expecting a statement from her, but links to support her community that was actively being harmed would have been an amazing use of her platform.

She gave a very typical Christian non-answer when talking about wanting to talk about her faith but also wanting to not push away people who believe differently. It reminds me of when you ask a church if they accept LGBTQIA+ people and instead of saying yes or no they say ‚Äúlet‚Äôs grab coffee and chat about that!‚Äù There was a lot of talking but not a lot of substance to the words they were saying. It seems like she doesn‚Äôt want to pick a side, like she knows if she was open about her true political beliefs that she passes of as religious beliefs she would lose a lot of her audience, and maybe even some sponsors. They even had the ‚Äúwe can have different beliefs and still be friends‚Äù conversation, which is wild to post right now. I get this was filmed a few weeks ago, but still. That part in particular came across as particularly insensitive. 

She ends it by saying she wants to care less, which doesn‚Äôt align with the hour she spent defending all of her actions ever, and the two additional hours I assume the next two hours will be.",15,1738626619.0,micheljanseYT,2,1.0,False

I got into coffee relatively recently (6 months ago) and am slowly scratching the surface of what I need to do and look for when pulling espresso shots. After buying a pair of scales and getting my ratios/times in a good spot I felt I was doing pretty good.

I however went to one of my usual caf√©s, and their espresso was better in every way : more pronounced yet pleasant acidity, thicker texture, no bitter defects...Went back home and brainstormed on how come. In a nutshell my thought process :

I currently have entry level equipment, and was pulling longer shots to account for potentially inferior equipment (say 18.5in to 40 out). Also my machine wasn't the cleanest.

Cleaned the machine, didn't really help with bitterness. Pulled shorter shots without adjusting grind (just like a second shorter) to a true 1:2 ratio. Reduced bitterness, but the acidity is not as ""clear"", not as pleasant as in the coffee shop, its more of a vague background aftertaste. Texture is still quite watery. Am I missing something here ? I feel like regardless of what I change, I'm not ""circling around the right thing"" going from one extreme to the other, in which case i'd be optimistic, but rather just missing the right thing completely. Does anyone have ideas ? Should I post a video of a shot so that maybe someone would identify potential gross mistakes I'm making ? Do I need a 2000$ machine ?(of course I do, I know I know). Is the standard of pro caf√©s just too high ?

Went to the movies with my friend/downstairs neighbor, K, yesterday. 

Genuinely such a good day. We went to the theater in the mall stopped by Target before the film to get some snacks to sneak in. I got vegan peanut butter cups. 

K and I also got matching Frog and Toad shirts to commemorate the occasion. MATCHING. FROG AND TOAD SHIRTS. Isn't that...so cozy? Very...hygge...I think. 

They're light green shirts with Frog and Toad reading together. There was another style of Frog and Toad shirt that was light blue, with Frog and Toad fishing together. I told K she could pick whichever she wanted, since she had good taste. 

She picked the one with them reading together. She picked it because she knows I don't support harming fish ;\_; Diary I...isn't that so touching?? For her to remember such details about me and consider them?

I love my new Frog and Toad shirt. 

We saw the movie Companion. It was SO GOOD. God. I fucking love Robots.  
  
 When I got home, my son was excited to see my new Frog and Toad shirt. ""I've read about them!!"" He exclaimed excitedly. 

And, he was excited that my new shirt matched the shirt he was wearing -- the exact same shade of light green (probably the exact same dye from the same Target supplier). 

K and I have agreed that we're going to try to do a movie day once a month. It was a good day. And it's good to spend Groundhog Day in a way that you wouldn't mind repeating.   


And today was a good day as well. Had the day off work for a doctor's appointment. The doctor's appointment was in the morning and I had the rest of the day free. 

I went to the mall. 

Yes, I got to go to the mall with K the previous day but I didn't really get to be present there. I was present with K. But the mall is a friend in and of itself.

I've been to so many places in the mall -- they're places that don't exist physically within the mall. They're just...places that I've been to in my mind over the years, which are linked to the sights and sounds and smells of the mall. 

The mall is a places where I can walk and walk and walk and walk and let my mind wander. Especially on weekdays and ESPECIALLY in the mornings, before the mall officially opens.

And the mall is also connected to a hotel where I have died and been born anew several times. AND to the hospital where I gave birth to my son. 

The whole place is just... deeply important. It's a portal. I went to the cafe at the confluence of the three and got breakfast and coffee. They have a new vegan option there!

I used to come a lot more often. The baristas inquired about my son. 

After breakfast I went back to the mall and then I walked and walked and walked. 

The mall is full of so much art. 

Sure. It's a monument to consumerism. But what other outlet do artists have in a capitalist society, besides marketable products?   
  
We give their art a chance to fulfill its true potential, if we take the opportunity to regard it for the passion and emotion they've put behind it.  
  
A perfume counter at a department store becomes a gallery. So many beautiful bottles and packages which call to mind glittering cityscapes at night, or passionate romance, or luxury and ease, or other ineffable, evocative things. One seemed possibly inspired by the inner mechanisms of an analog clock? A few seemed technology inspired -- typically inscribed in shining silver or gold against a dark background. 

So much talent and thought went into them.   
  
What a creative endeavor, crafting a representation of a fragrance, through a visual medium -- trying to align the senses and create some vivid association. 

There's a lot of interesting art at the mall. 

There are a lot of interesting people at the mall. And on a laid-back day off, it's so easy to feel a great up welling of love for every single one of them. 

I just like being there, at the mall. Fading in and out from the physical location to the recesses of my mind. It's blissful. 

I didn't want to leave. But I had things I needed to do at home. I felt like I literally needed to tear myself away, internally kicking and screaming. 

I promised myself we'd do this again, soon. 

At home, I cleaned my bathroom. And now I have that sort of sense of peace and accomplishment that comes with having attained a more cleanly space. 

I need more days like today. 

OH! But also,...today I FINALLY heard back from FANCY PRIVATE BOARDING SCHOOL. Who I interviewed with a long while back.

And they had ghosted me.

I have been trying to rearrange my living room for some time but just can‚Äôt seem to find a better arrangement for it. The issue is that there‚Äôs a door to the bedroom that is in the middle of the wall, so it‚Äôs difficult to figure out where the TV should go. Because of that, the TV is in the corner which makes it awkward to look at from the couches. There‚Äôs also a radiator that is at the corner of the room which combined with the door, makes moving the couch by the window difficult. 

I‚Äôm looking for any suggestions on living room layouts. The hope is to make the space feel more inviting/homey where I can have guests come over and play games/watch TV comfortably. I would like to eventually get a rug, coffee table and larger TV in the future once I decide on a more feng shui room arrangement. Please help!",1,1738626103.0,DesignMyRoom,1,1.0,False

 and then on new years eve he begged me to think about it and start over. early january was beautiful, everything went better than during out relationship. fast forward, in january we were arguing a bit because i was missing him and overreacted about him not being here with me. on the other hand i started to go out more. i texted him back less and less which made him mad and then we argued about that too. but during that time we talked every day, we met up to have a drink or coffee once a week and talked all day. 
nowadays ive been stressing a bit about exams etc. today we met up. i alreadly felt movement ant thought my manifestations are right around the corner. but today he asked me if i have a new boyfriend because i feel off. i told him no and ive been waiting for him just like he asked, and i dont know what is happening betweem us because ad i mentioned in early january we kissed, told i love you to each other, did sleep overs etc and then boom less and less interaction.
he told me that nothing went wrong he just kinda got bored because we always argue about the same things again and again. (our arguments were based of his jealousy and my neediness as i mentioned) i told him i wanted to give it one more try just like we agreed about it but it seemed like he let our relationship go. i told him i want to give him his clothes and belongings back when he gets back to our city (he visited his family for a few days)
he told be that it hurts him because i dont want to keep our pictures etc and it looks like i want to forget him. i told him i dont eant to talk anymore after he gets his stuff back. after we said goodbye ha immediately texted me, sent me lots of tiktoks, send me love songs like ‚Äújust the two of us, we can make it if we try‚Äù
so i dont know what should i do. i feel like something started but on the other hand he

Since last thursday he suddenly stopped going outside, he suddenly doesnt want to eat anymore im begging him to eat but he‚Äôll eat such an insane small amount of food maybe a tablespoon or 2, hes diabetic so im freaking out.. he doesnt talk alot anymore all of a sudden, hes constantly in his room in bed, not doing anything just lying down.. what is going on he was still somewhat ‚Äúokay‚Äù just a week ago is this normal?? He was overeating for the last 6 months was constantly hungry and kept forgetting he already had dinner.. now hes not eating anything and barely drinking, he doesnt even want to drink his daily coffee anymore

5 months ago, I got a yeast infection. I‚Äôve had a couple before, and diflucan would work almost immediately. Due to needing a major ortho surgery, I had to take a course of antibiotics over the period of about 2 months. Ever since then, I‚Äôve had the worst yeast infection I‚Äôve ever experienced. It‚Äôs been over 5 months now, with no signs of it going away.
I‚Äôve tried opositv vaginal probiotics, kombucha, boric acid suppositories, over 3 rounds of diflucan, monistat 1,3, and 7, clotrimizole, candida diet, and more. All with no luck.

I have seen a gyne about this, and they did a swab. They told me it was yeast, and have only prescribed diflucan and clotrimizole as of now. I‚Äôm losing hope of ever restoring my pH balance. 

I am in a passionate, romantic relationship with my partner, and we just cannot handle the fact that we aren‚Äôt supposed to be sharing intimacy together‚Ä¶ so, in the process, I have been letting them massage my clit on occasion. Is there any way this could be hindering the medication from working? It‚Äôs never internal, but I figured I‚Äôd add that. I also drink coffee pretty much daily, I heard that can have an effect, but I quit drinking it for a while with no changes. I do not consume alcohol.

When we first got together, we lived close to each other. We spent a lot of time together but would spend a night or two a week apart. After about 6 months though, it seemed smart for us to consolidate our bills. We love each other very much, and I love spending time with him and miss him when one or the other of us has to occasionally travel for work. We are planning on moving soon, from the west coast to the east coast of the US. 

Before we moved in together, I‚Äôd only ever lived with one other boyfriend, and to be honest it wasn‚Äôt a great experience. Otherwise, I‚Äôve either lived alone or with roommates, and have also moved around a lot. I don‚Äôt really have too many pieces of furniture that are just mine as a result. A lot of the furniture in our apartment is stuff that he‚Äôs had for years. Our bed frame, our couch, our coffee tables, our desk in our shared office, are all originally his. They‚Äôre nice pieces of furniture, too, things he has found, thrifted, restored, and so on. But there‚Äôs very little that‚Äôs mine in the apartment. Most of my possessions are things like books or clothing or art supplies, and most of that has been packed away for a while, since we‚Äôre moving in the next couple of months after many months of planning. 

When I lived alone, I also felt like it was a little easier to determine my own schedule. I used to come home from work and sometimes I would not talk to anyone at all, and just paint or write. Or sometimes I would go out, on long walks or to writing groups or to be a nerd and read in the corners of dive bars by myself. I‚Äôm pretty introverted, and like my solitude. My partner is also introverted, but he loves quality time. When he‚Äôs home, he wants to hang out by my side, even if we aren‚Äôt doing the same thing. I‚Äôve largely stopped going out. Most of the time, I love just spending time with just us two. We hike together, play games together, and we love just being in each other‚Äôs company. But recently I feel kind of cramped. I feel like our space is ‚Äúhis‚Äù or ‚Äúours,‚Äù but not mine. I‚Äôm finding it kind of difficult to write or do art more consistently, which is taking a slow toll on my mental health. 

I‚Äôm starting to fantasize about living in my own space, what it would be like to have my own couch, my own bed, a hutch for my records, etc. What it would be like to wake up on a Saturday morning and take things at exactly my own pace. I think part of this is stress from our impending move. My bf has never moved this far away from his hometown before, and he is excited and really wants to live in this new city, but I kind of have to hold his hand through each step in the process. I think the other part is that, even after 3 years, I don‚Äôt really know how to fully balance partnership and independence. I‚Äôm really frustrated at myself, because I really love my bf so much and I love our life together and all the time we do spend together, but these daydreams of living alone keep seeping in. I haven‚Äôt communicated any of this to him because I don‚Äôt want to hurt him or make him think I‚Äôm not committed when I am. He‚Äôs such a cool person, and I love him so much. I‚Äôd just like some advice on how to deal with these feelings of feeling a little cramped, or how to broach the subject to him in a way that isn‚Äôt going to make him feel panicked.

1ih3cls,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingadvice/comments/1ih3cls/feeling_cramped_but_in_love/,Feeling cramped but in love,"My bf (35M) and I (32F) have been together for about 3 years and living together for 2.5. When we first got together, we lived close to each other. We spent a lot of time together but would spend a night or two a week apart. After about 6 months though, it seemed smart for us to consolidate our bills. We love each other very much, and I love spending time with him and miss him when one or the other of us has to occasionally travel for work. We are planning on moving soon, from the west coast to the east coast of the US. 

Before we moved in together, I‚Äôd only ever lived with one other boyfriend, and to be honest it wasn‚Äôt a great experience. Otherwise, I‚Äôve either lived alone or with roommates, and have also moved around a lot. I don‚Äôt really have too many pieces of furniture that are just mine as a result. A lot of the furniture in our apartment is stuff that he‚Äôs had for years. Our bed frame, our couch, our coffee tables, our desk in our shared office, are all originally his. They‚Äôre nice pieces of furniture, too, things he has found, thrifted, restored, and so on. But there‚Äôs very little that‚Äôs mine in the apartment. Most of my possessions are things like books or clothing or art supplies, and most of that has been packed away for a while, since we‚Äôre moving in the next couple of months after many months of planning. 

When I lived alone, I also felt like it was a little easier to determine my own schedule. I used to come home from work and sometimes I would not talk to anyone at all, and just paint or write. Or sometimes I would go out, on long walks or to writing groups or to be a nerd and read in the corners of dive bars by myself. I‚Äôm pretty introverted, and like my solitude. My partner is also introverted, but he loves quality time. When he‚Äôs home, he wants to hang out by my side, even if we aren‚Äôt doing the same thing. I‚Äôve largely stopped going out. Most of the time, I love just spending time with just us two. We hike together, play games together, and we love just being in each other‚Äôs company. But recently I feel kind of cramped. I feel like our space is ‚Äúhis‚Äù or ‚Äúours,‚Äù but not mine. I‚Äôm finding it kind of difficult to write or do art more consistently, which is taking a slow toll on my mental health. 

I‚Äôm starting to fantasize about living in my own space, what it would be like to have my own couch, my own bed, a hutch for my records, etc. What it would be like to wake up on a Saturday morning and take things at exactly my own pace. I think part of this is stress from our impending move. My bf has never moved this far away from his hometown before, and he is excited and really wants to live in this new city, but I kind of have to hold his hand through each step in the process. I think the other part is that, even after 3 years, I don‚Äôt really know how to fully balance partnership and independence. I‚Äôm really frustrated at myself, because I really love my bf so much and I love our life together and all the time we do spend together, but these daydreams of living alone keep seeping in. I haven‚Äôt communicated any of this to him because I don‚Äôt want to hurt him or make him think I‚Äôm not committed when I am. He‚Äôs such a cool person, and I love him so much. I‚Äôd just like some advice on how to deal with these feelings of feeling a little cramped, or how to broach the subject to him in a way that isn‚Äôt going to make him feel panicked. 

TLDR; I love my bf but I feel cramped, how do I navigate this in a way that doesn‚Äôt make him feel upset?",1,1738625065.0,datingadvice,3,1.0,False

I‚Äôm South American but live in France for studies. Last year I‚Äôve got a lot of mental health issues and I kinda isolated myself from others, even though I have good friends and all of this. However, I‚Äôve got problems to go back to my country and leave where I live (I couldn‚Äôt even go visit my girlfriend that lives in Czechia), so my parents came. It was really nice at the beginning, just I had to take be with them all the time because apparently they‚Äôre unable to get oriented and use google maps (I‚Äôm being ironic, they don‚Äôt have any orientation issue and even know how to communicate in basic English/French, it was obvious they were pretending), so they kinda made me spend all the time with them. Ofc as they were visiting me for 3 weeks I planned to spend most of my time with them, BUT this was pretty uncomfortable as some things of my routine (taking care of my best friend‚Äôs plants and cat, go to the gym, finish my final papers‚Ä¶) were heavily altered, as they expected me to be ALL THE DAY with them. I even told them I had to clean my space and they expected me to do it in one hour because then they were insisting to be all day with them and even sleeping were they were staying (they couldn‚Äôt stay with me as I live in a student residence and there is no space + it is forbidden to make people stay more than one night).

At the beginning I could take it, and I actually needed as I was still really really bad. However, there were some kinda manipulative comments, especially with the fact that ‚Äúmy family is the only truly loving me and supporting me‚Äù and all of this. And also, my dad was making every day the comment of my mom staying for one month more here in France. But like every day, since the beginning, because I ‚Äúneeded help to finish things‚Äù (which was partially true, but my mom doesn‚Äôt know how to do administrative stuff nor political science stuff for my thesis, but ok).

Because of all my problems, I had to send my papers really really late (authorised by my university) and I am pretty late with my thesis, especially as I had to restart a lot of things, and even the academic body gave me extra time to finish it (I can graduate with the condition of passing my thesis soon after, and this doesn‚Äôt affect any postulation besides trying to get a phd in the same uni, which is not in my plans). My parents were manipulating me to stop doing this as THEY WANT ME TO FINISH IT ON TIME (even tho no teacher wants to be my director if I don‚Äôt ask for extra time) + they want me to start thinking on what to do in my future, which would be normal if it wasn‚Äôt by the fact that THEY KEEP SPAMMING WITH DIFFERENT PHD OR MASTERS, AND START EVERY DAY IS A DIFFERENT THING THEY WANT ME TO APPLY THO (even if the application period hasn‚Äôt truly started).

This is important to know the current situation. So one day I had a big breakdown and meltdown (I‚Äôm autistic) and my father profit to insist in the fact of my mom staying, and I finished by accepting as I was really bad. They literally didn‚Äôt wait and almost suddenly changed the return date for her and talked to the Airbnb girl to extend my mom‚Äôs stay.

My dad returned and I was still with my mom. I had a psychiatrist appointment and my university opened on the 6th of January. My mom at that moment told me that I was going to the uni everyday to finish my thesis as I‚Äôm on a rush and I also told her that I had to return to my routines. She was ok and at the beginning it was really easy to organise my life. It was mostly going to the campus, working all day and at 5-6 pm go see my mom, visit something or take a coffee, and then return. But then, one night she told me to stay overnight (I was at her airbnb) and I accepted‚Ä¶ I shouldn‚Äôt.

Since then, the dynamics change. My mom started being more possessive. She started insisting on sleeping at her place every night. Ok so, it would be ok if it was just that, but next day she just didn‚Äôt wake me up early (even when telling so). She takes her time with me, but like a lot, without respecting the fact I have to do my thesis and that I‚Äôm late on it. I also stopped being consistent with gym because she insists on being with her and is always like ‚Äúyou can go tomorrow‚Äù. And at night, it restarts. And it is not that she is alone, she has friends here (the moms of other friends from my home country), but she insists on being with her (she even wants me to be with her and with her friends), and sometimes she comes to my place without even telling me (she just calls me saying she‚Äôs outside). 
And when I tell her I can‚Äôt go to her place to eat or sleep because I have things to do or I have to see a friend, she just changes her tone, starts being really sad and keeps saying ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù. And also, when she is with me, sometimes she just starts telling me her problems or traumas, and then changes to a friendly voice to ask me if I want to go sleep with her. And her place is really small and I need my space, but she doesn‚Äôt want to respect that and idk what to tell her. When I‚Äôm working all day she keeps calling me ALL DAY, and even when I agree to go, she keeps behind me to confirm it. And also, she has started to put faces when I tell her that I‚Äôm gonna see any of my friends and sometimes when we‚Äôre doing other things, she starts making comments that ‚Äúmy family is always for me and it is the only one who truly loves me and will be there for me‚Äù. And it is not that she doesn‚Äôt like my friends, it is that she wants me to just spend my time with her. She even puts faces when I sleep at her place and I call my girlfriend. The worst part? My dad supports her attitude (while at the same time keeps pressuring me with my thesis‚Ä¶ last day he called me out for being late and going to a party, when I even didn‚Äôt stay late as next day I had things to do).
She is going back soon, but this just makes her being more insistent. I know because of my cousins that the days she doesn‚Äôt see me she starts crying and telling them that I don‚Äôt love her (even after a weekend spending literally ALL THE TIME together).

# üìä¬†[Benchmarking ChatGPT, Qwen, and DeepSeek on Real-World AI Tasks:](https://decodebuzzing.medium.com/qbenchmarking-chatgpt-qwen-and-deepseek-on-real-world-ai-tasks-75b4d7040742)

A comprehensive study compares the performance of ChatGPT, Qwen, and DeepSeek across various real-world AI applications, including language understanding, data analysis, and complex problem-solving.

Which AI Model Outperforms in¬†Coding, Mechanics, and Algorithmic Precision‚Äî¬†Which Model Delivers Real-World Precision?

# Comparative Analysis of AI Model Capabilities:-

# 1. Chatgpt

ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI still remains a dominant force in the AI space, built on the¬†**powerful GPT-5 architecture**¬†and fine-tuned using¬†**Reinforcement Learning from**¬†**Human Feedback (RLHF)**. It‚Äôs a reliable go-to for a range of tasks, from creative writing to technical documentation, making it a top choice for content creators, educators, and startups However, it‚Äôs not perfect. When it comes to specialized fields, like advanced mathematics or niche legal domains, it can struggle. On top of that, its high infrastructure costs make it tough for smaller businesses or individual developers to access it easily

# 2. Deepseek

Out of nowhere, DeepSeek emerged as a dark horse in the AI race challenging established giants with its focus on¬†**computational precision and efficiency.**

Unlike its competitors, it‚Äôs tailored for scientific and mathematical tasks and is trained on top datasets like¬†*arXiv and Wolfram Alph*a, which helps it perform well in areas like optimization,¬†**physics simulations**, and¬†**complex**¬†**math problems**. DeepSeek‚Äôs real strength is how cheap it is ( no china pun intended üò§). While models like ChatGPT and Qwen require massive resources, Deepseek does the job with way less cost. So yeah you don't need to get $1000 for a ChatGPT subscription

# 3. Qwen

After Deepseek who would‚Äôve thought another Chinese AI would pop up and start taking over? Classic China move ‚Äî spread something and this time it‚Äôs AI lol

Qwen is dominating the business game with its multilingual setup, excelling in places like Asia, especially with Mandarin and Arabic. It‚Äôs the go-to for legal and financial tasks, and it is not a reasoning model like DeepSeek R1, meaning you can‚Äôt see its thinking process. But just like DeepSeek, it‚Äôs got that robotic vibe, making it less fun for casual or creative work. If you want something more flexible, Qwen might not be the best hang



# #1 ChatGPT‚Äôs Output: Fast but Flawed

With Chatgpt I had high expectations. But the results? Let‚Äôs just say they were‚Ä¶ underwhelming. While DeepSeek took its time for accuracy, ChatGPT instantly spat out a clean-looking script. The ball didn‚Äôt bounce realistically. Instead, it¬†**glitched around the edges of the box**, sometimes getting stuck in the corners or phasing through the walls.¬†**It is clear that ChatGPT prefers speed over depth, delivers a solution that works ‚Äî but only in the most basic sense.**¬†



# #2 Deepseek

DeepSeek‚Äôs output left me genuinely amazed. While ChatGPT was quick to generate code, DeepSeek took 200 seconds just to think about the problem. DeepSeek didn‚Äôt just write a functional script; it crafted a¬†**highly optimized, physics-accurate simulation** that handled every edge case flawlessly.



# #3 Qwen‚Äôs Output: A Disappointing Attempt

If ChatGPT‚Äôs output was underwhelming,¬†**Qwen‚Äôs was downright disappointing**. Given Qwen‚Äôs strong reputation for handling complex tasks, I really had high expectations for its performance. But when I ran its code for the rotating ball simulation, the results were¬†**far from what I expected**. Like ChatGPT, Qwen generated code almost instantly ‚Äî no deep thinking.

The¬†**ball was outside the box**¬†for most of the simulation, completely defying the laws of physics.The¬†**box itself was half out of frame**, so only a portion of it was visible on the canvas.



# Final Verdict: Who Should Use Which AI?

* **Researchers**: DeepSeek
* **Engineers**: DeepSeek
* **Writers**: ChatGPT or Qwen
* **Lawyers**: Qwen with chatgpt
* **Educators**: ChatGPT
* **Content Creators**: Qwen and deep-thinking from Deepseek

**What this means:**¬†The benchmarking results provide critical insights into the strengths and limitations of each model, helping businesses and developers choose the best AI solution for specific tasks. This also highlights the rapid evolution of AI capabilities in real-world scenarios. \[[Listen](https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/ai-unraveled-latest-ai-news-trends-chatgpt-gemini-gen/id1684415169)\] \[[2025/02/03](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/master-ai-machine-learning-pro/id1610947211)\]

Overall we liked it. Food was better and we liked the vibe. We do think Royal has better entertainment though. But we‚Äôd definitely do another VV. 

Here are two tips I didn‚Äôt see elsewhere (although I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not the first person pointing these out. 

#1) If you get coffee from the free coffee/tea area, you can grab a paper travel cup and lid from the coffee bar instead of using the regular ceramic cups. Sometimes they had a stack set out where you could grab them. But even when they didn‚Äôt, they never minded handing you one or letting you take one from their stack. It‚Äôs a lot easier taking it back tot he room with a lid. 

#2) on the subject of taking things back tot he room. If you‚Äôre taking food/drinks back to the room, grab a metal tray from the taco bar. They have them stacked to the side. They are bigger than a plate and have a nice flat surface, which makes for a more stable walk back if you‚Äôre balancing drinks. 

BONUS TIP: we found that if you don‚Äôt have reservations, you can show up early to ensure you are first in line, and they will sit you at the bar. That happened for us at Extra Virgin, and we saw another couple do it at Pink Agave.

1ih33vi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1ih33vi/i_became_deaf_in_my_20s_and_i_couldnt_afford_to/,"I became deaf in my 20s, and I couldn't afford to pay for the implant that would restore my hearing. A nameless organization offered to pay for it, and when I accepted, I started to hear things no person should ever have to hear.","
Before I start, I‚Äôd like to be as transparent as possible.

Twenty years ago, I was convicted of manslaughter. 

Framed by an organization that took my need and my vulnerability and twisted it to their own ends.

I can‚Äôt right my wrongs, and I know that. I‚Äôll live with the consequences of trusting them for the rest of my life. 

Now that I‚Äôm free, though, I've finally decided to put the truth of what happened to me out into the world, which boils down to this:

The organization implanted something that allowed me to hear sounds that are normally well out of reach from our perception. Sounds that the human mind wasn‚Äôt designed to withstand - an imperceptible cacophony that is occurring all around you as you read this, you just don't know it. It‚Äôs occurring around me as I write this as well, and although I can‚Äôt physically hear it, I can still *feel* it. It's faint, but I know it's there. 

And once I came to understand what they did, they made sure to silence me. 

\------------------

***11/01/02 - Ten days before the incident.*** 

*‚ÄúReady?‚Äù*

I nodded, which was only kind of a lie. I was *always* ready for this part of my week to be over, but I was never quite ready for the god-awful sensation.

Hewitt clicked the remote, and the implant in my left temple whirred to life. It always started gently. A quiet buzzing. Irritating, but only mildly so. Inevitably, however, the sound and the vibration crescendoed. What started as a soft hum grew into a furious droning, like a cicada vibrating angry verses from the inside of my skull.

I gritted my teeth and closed my eyes tight.

*Only a few more seconds.*

Finally, when I could barely tolerate it anymore, a climatic shockwave radiated from the device, causing my jaw to clack from the force. With the reverberation dissipating as it moved further down my body, the device stilled.

A sigh of relief spilled from my lips.

I opened my eyes and saw green light reflecting off of Hewitt‚Äôs thick glasses from the implant‚Äôs remote. In layman‚Äôs terms, I‚Äôd learned that meant ‚Äúall good‚Äù.

Hewitt smiled, creasing his weathered cheeks.

*‚ÄúThe implant is primed. Let me collect my materials so we can get this show on the road.‚Äù*

The stout Italian physician shot up from his desk chair and turned to face the wooden cabinets that lined the back of his office. Despite his advanced age and bulky frame, he was still remarkably spry.

*‚ÄúThanks. By the way, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever be ‚Äòready‚Äô for that, Doc. For any of this, actually. You can probably stop asking. Save your breath, I mean.‚Äù*

As I spoke, it felt like heavy grains of sand were swimming around my molars. I swished the pebbles onto my tongue and spat them into my hand, frowning at the chalky crystals in my palm.

*‚ÄúJesus. Cracked another filling. Does the Audiology department have a P.O. box I can forward my dental bills to?‚Äù*

He chuckled weakly as he turned back towards me. The old doctor was only half-listening, now preoccupied with assembling the familiar experimental set up. Carefully, he placed a Buddha statue, a spray bottle of clear liquid, four half-foot tall metal pillars, and a capped petri dish on the desk.

Absentmindedly, I rubbed the scar above my temple. Most of the time, I just pretended like I could perceive the outline of the dime-sized implant. The delusion helped me feel in control.

But I wasn‚Äôt in control. Not completely, at least. 

I shared control with the remote in Hewitt‚Äôs hand, especially when *his* part of the implant was active. The experimental portion. Suppressing the existential anxiety that came with split dominance was challenging. I wasn‚Äôt used to my sensations being a democracy.

The concession felt worth it, though. The implant restored my hearing, and Hewitt installed it free, with a single string attached: I had to play ball with these weekly sessions, testing the part of the implant that I wasn‚Äôt allowed to know anything about, per our agreement.

On the desk, the doctor was arranging the metal pillars into a small square. Once satisfied with the dimensions of the square, he‚Äôd position the statue, the spray bottle, and the petri dish into the center of it. Then, testing would finally begin.

*‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶are your other patients tolerating this thing okay?‚Äù* I asked, fishing for a few reassuring words.

The doctor looked up from his designs, pointing a brown iris and a bushy white eyebrow at me.

*‚ÄúThere are no other patients like you, David.‚Äù*

He paused for a moment, maintaining unbroken eye contact, as if to highlight the importance of what just came out of his mouth. Abruptly, he severed his gaze and resumed fidgeting with the metal pillars, but he continued to talk.

*‚ÄúYour case, this situation, its‚Ä¶unique. A marriage of circumstances. When the brain infection took your hearing, any model of cochlear implant could have been used to repair it. But you couldn‚Äôt afford them, not even the cheapest one. At the exact same time, my lab was looking for an elegant solution to our own problem. A friend of a friend was aware of both of our dilemmas. You needed an implant for free, and we needed a‚Ä¶‚Äù*

He stopped talking mid-sentence and swiveled his head around the setup, examining it from different angles and elevations, but he made no further modifications. It seemed like everything was in its right place. Contented, he sat back down in his chair, and briefly, Hewitt was motionless. He looked either lost in his thoughts, captivated by things he‚Äôd rather not say out loud, or he was resting and not thinking about anything at all.

Either way, it took a moment for him to remember he had been explaining something to me. My confused facial expression probably sped that process along.

*‚ÄúRight. We needed a‚Ä¶‚Äù* he trailed off, wringing his hand to convey he was searching for the correct word in English.

*‚ÄúWe needed an ‚Äòoperator‚Äô. Someone to tell us that the device worked like we had designed it to. I wouldn‚Äôt say this was an elegant solution, but we‚Äôre both getting something out of the deal, I suppose.‚Äù*

In the nine months since the implantation, this was by far the most Hewitt ever divulged about the deeper contents of their arrangement.

As requested, he didn‚Äôt check if I was ready this time; instead, he winked and clicked another button on the remote.

*‚ÄúWhat do you hear?‚Äù*

Instantly, I could hear sound emanating from each of the stationary objects in the middle of the square. Nothing moved, and yet a loud, rhythmic drumming filled my ears. Despite being able to tell the noise was coming from directly in front of me, it sounded incredibly distant, too. Like it was echoing from the depths of a massive cave system before it reached me standing at the cave‚Äôs entrance.

What started a single drum eventually became a frenzied ensemble. Over only a few seconds, hundreds of drum rolls layered over each other until the chaotic pounding caused my head to throb. The Budha was grinning, but that‚Äôs not what I heard. I heard the marble figure screaming at me, its voice made of deafening thunder rather than anything recognizably human.

I cradled my temple with my palm and grimaced, shouting an answer to Hewitt‚Äôs question.

*‚ÄúAll three things are drumming, same as always, Doc.‚Äù*

He clicked the remote again, and like the flick of a switch, the objects became silent immediately. 

*‚ÄúThank you, David. Head to the lobby, grab a book and have Annemarie make you a cup of coffee. In about an hour, I‚Äôll call you back. We‚Äôll repeat the procedure, I‚Äôll deactivate the implant, and you‚Äôll be done for the week.‚Äù*

My legs pulled my body out of the chair without a shred of hesitation. I was dying to leave the office and get some fresh air. As my hand gripped the doorknob, however, Hewitt‚Äôs words rang in my head.

*There are no other patients like you, David.*

I turned back to the doctor, who was now spraying down the statue with the unknown liquid.

‚Äú*Hewitt‚Ä¶you mentioned something when we first met in the hospital - about our contract. You said that, eventually, you‚Äôd be able to explain to me what we‚Äôre doing here. I know I‚Äôve never brought it up before now. I think I used to be more scared of knowing than I was of being left in the dark, and, well‚Ä¶I‚Äôve sort of been feeling the opposite way, as of late. Is that option still on the table?‚Äù*

Although he interrupted what he was doing, he didn‚Äôt meet my gaze. Instead, he kept his focus on the statue and muttered a halfhearted response.

‚Äú*I can appeal to the board. No promises, David.‚Äù*

When I returned an hour later, the objects and the pillars were in their same positions, but the Buddha had a new, glistening shine on its marble skin.

As the device activated, the horrible drumming reappeared, but only from the spray bottle and the petri dish. The statue remained eerily quiet. 

Hewitt clicked the remote one last time. The implant beeped three times, and then released one last shockwave, weaker than the one that came with ‚Äúpriming‚Äù his part of the device. This supposedly meant the implant had completely deactivated its experimental portion. I was told the designers never intended me to experience the drumming outside a controlled setting.

*‚ÄúWell, that's all for today. You have my cell phone number. I may not always be able to answer, but call me if there are any issues. Feel free to leave a message, as well.‚Äù*

He shook my hand, forced a smile, and then waved me out of his office.

As I turned to leave, my eyes fell on the gleaming statue still sitting on his desk. Although the silence better matched the figure‚Äôs smile, I couldn‚Äôt help but feel like it was still screaming, berating me for being so na√Øve.

I just couldn‚Äôt hear it anymore.

\------------------

Below, I‚Äôve typed out what I can recall of the messages I left for Hewitt leading up to my inditement. 

Here's what I remember: 

\------------------

***11/05/02 - Six days before the incident.***

***Me:*** *Hey Hewitt. First off, everything is OK. I know I‚Äôve never called you on your cell before, so I don‚Äôt want you to think that‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt want you to think there‚Äôs a big emergency or something. I mean‚Ä¶there kind of was, but I‚Äôm alright.*

*I was in a car accident. Drunk driver fell asleep at the wheel, swerved into traffic and I T-boned him. Not sure he walked away from the wreck‚Ä¶but I‚Äôm hanging in there, all things considered. Just a broken rib and a nasty concussion on my end. Banged the side of my head against the steering wheel pretty hard.*

*Still hearing everything OK, so I‚Äôm assuming the device is working fine, but I figured with the head injury‚Ä¶I figured you might want to know. Especially since our next appointment isn't for another week.*

*Give me a call back at* \[xxx-xxx-xxxx\] *when you can.*

\------------------

***11/06/02 - Five days before.***

***Me:*** *Got your machine again, I guess. Haven‚Äôt heard from you, so I suppose you aren‚Äôt too worried about me‚Ä¶or the implant. Which is good! Which is good...*

*But‚Ä¶uhh‚Ä¶maybe you should be. I am‚Ä¶after last night.*

*I started‚Ä¶hearing the drumming at home. Just little bits of it, here and there. Much quieter than usual.* 

*I was sitting at my computer‚Ä¶and I heard it in the background of the music I was listening to. It just kind of‚Ä¶appeared. I‚Äôm not sure how long it was there before I noticed it. At first, I thought I was hearing things, but as I walked through my apartment, it became louder. Muffled, though. Felt like it was coming from multiple places rather than one. Eventually, I thought I tracked it to a drawer in my kitchen, but when I pulled it opened, it stopped‚Ä¶all of a sudden.*

*I guess it could be the concussion, but the noise is so‚Ä¶distinctive. An invisible jackhammer banging into invisible concrete, like I‚Äôve told you.*

*Anyway‚Ä¶just call me back.*

*Oh! Before I forget, have you heard from the board? I‚Äôd‚Ä¶I‚Äôd really like to know what this thing does. In addition to my hearing, I mean.*

\------------------

***11/08/02 - Three days before.***

***Me:*** *Doc - where the fuck are you?*

*‚Ä¶sorry. Didn‚Äôt mean to lose my temper. I‚Ä¶I haven‚Äôt slept.*

*Can the implant‚Ä¶turn on by itself? I‚Äôm‚Ä¶I‚Äôm definitely hearing‚Ä¶whatever I‚Äôm being trained to hear.*

*It‚Äôs‚Ä¶it‚Äôs everywhere. Comes and goes at random. Or‚Ä¶maybe I‚Äôm just starting to hear it when I face it a certain way. My head‚Ä¶it feels like an antenna. If I turn my head up and to the left‚Ä¶it all goes away. Any other position, though, and I can hear the drumming. Like I said - everywhere. On my phone, my clothes, the walls‚Ä¶*

*I‚Ä¶I heard it inside myself, too.*

*I managed to fall asleep, but I guess I relaxed, and my muscles relaxed and‚Ä¶well, my head must have turned, because I could hear it again.* 

*Loud as hell...from the inside of my mouth.* 

*I‚Äôm not proud, but I‚Ä¶I kind of freaked out. Put my hands in my mouth and just‚Ä¶just started scraping. I‚Ä¶I wanted it out of me. Dug at my gums‚Ä¶its really bad.*

*I can‚Äôt drive, either. I mean, I can try, but I feel like I‚Äôll just get in another wreck, trying to keep my head up and to the left while driving. And‚Ä¶what if it still happens? Even though my heads in the right place?*

*Please‚Ä¶please call me.*

\------------------

***11/10/02 - One day before.***

***Me:*** *‚Ä¶I‚Äôve started to feel it all, Hewitt.*

*The drumming‚Ä¶it‚Äôs moving over everything. It‚Äôs* ***in*** *everything. It breaks you, and then it rebuilds you again. And now, I have only one sense, not five.*

*I don‚Äôt see, I don‚Äôt taste, smell, touch‚Ä¶and I certainly don‚Äôt hear. Not anymore.*

*But I feel the current.* 

*I feel it writhing and pounding and slipping and fucking and expanding and consuming and living and dying over every‚Ä¶****goddamned****‚Ä¶thing.*

*It speaks to me. Not in a language or a tongue. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶it‚Äôs a tide. It ebbs and flows.*

*It sings wordless songs to me‚Ä¶and I understand, now.* 

*I thought you cursed me, Hewitt. But all transitions cause pain. I mean, how do you turn a liquid into a gas?*

*You boil it. And when it bubbles its tiny pleading screams, you certainly don‚Äôt stop.*

*You turn up the heat.*

\------------------

***11/11/02 - Day of the incident***

***Me:*** *Hello?* **(shouting)**

***Hewitt:*** *David, are you at home?*

***Me:*** *Doc - oh thank God. You‚Ä¶you gotta help me‚Ä¶oh God‚Ä¶it‚Äôs‚Ä¶it‚Äôs everywhere‚Ä¶I‚Äôm nothing‚Ä¶I‚Äôm nothing‚Ä¶* **(shouting)**

***Hewitt:*** *Can you get to the-***(I cut him off)**

***Me:*** *Please‚Ä¶please make it stop. Why doesn‚Äôt it ever‚Ä¶why doesn‚Äôt it ever stop‚Ä¶* **(Crying, shouting)**

***Hewitt:*** *David, I need you to calm down.*

***Me:*** *Am I hearing death, Hewitt? Can God hear what I can hear, Doc, or are they too scared?* **(Laughing, shouting)**

***Hewitt:*** *LISTEN.* **(shouting)**

***Me:*** ‚Ä¶ **(line goes dead)**

***Hewitt:*** *You‚Äôre hearing the microscopic, David. It was all just supposed to be a novel way to test the effectiveness of anti-infectious agents. Once they stopped moving, we know the medication killed them. We stood to make a lot of money off of the technology, but we couldn't prove it worked. Not until you. You‚Äôve‚Ä¶you‚Äôve helped so many people, David‚Ä¶*

***Me:*** **(quietly)** *I‚Äôve been able‚Ä¶able to hear, able to feel‚Ä¶the billions of living things‚Ä¶moving around‚Ä¶on my skin‚Ä¶inside me‚Ä¶everywhere‚Ä¶*

***Hewitt:*** *Don't call an ambulance, don't call the police. We're coming to pick you up.*

\------------------

I don't remember much from that night other than this conversation. I can vaguely recall Hewitt arriving at my apartment, remote in hand. He examines my head, and I'm fading in and out of consciousness. 

When I fully come to, I'm lying on my couch, holding a gun I'd never seen before. A few steps away is Hewitt's corpse. 

And I start crying - not out of fear or confusion, out of relief. 

It's finally quiet. Silent as the grave. The endless drumming of infinite microorganisms crawling around me and within me has vanished. 

Just then, my weeping is interpreted by man rounding the corner into my living room. He's well dressed with dark blue eyes, and he walks over to sit next to me, stepping over Hewitt as he does. 

He introduces himself as Hewitt. Tells me the body won't be needing the name anymore, so it's his now. 

*""Listen, David, we have some new terms. You can still keep the device, meaning you can keep your hearing. Its fixed now, too. You won't be hearing anything you weren't meant to hear from now until the day you die.""*

*""As with any fair deal, I have some conditions. You can't tell anyone what you heard, and you have to take the fall for the killing of the nameless body in front of you. If you do those things, you'll be safe.""*

*""Fail to abide by those conditions, and we're turning the noise back on. All of it. And we'll leave it on, up until the moment you choke on your own tongue. Not a second sooner.""*

*""Do you understand, David?""*

\------------------

I agreed to the terms then, but I've had a little change of heart. Jail gave me perspective. 

You see, the punishment behind incarceration is that you lose your autonomy. That's your incentive to reform. Serve your time, play by the rules and hey, maybe we'll give you your agency back. Maybe you'll have an opportunity to own your body again. 

It makes you realize that agency and autonomy are the only things that really have value in this world. Without them, you have nothing. 

And what is this implant, but another jail? I've wanted to speak up for so damn long, but the threat of being subjected to the drumming again has kept me silent. 

Well, I've changed. I'm tired of just settling for what they'll give me. I want my goddamned agency back. 

So, to the creators of the implant, consider this my resignation from our contract. In addition, I have a few choice words. I am relying on the internet to carry them to you, wherever you are.

1ih32u2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ih32u2/feeling_cramped_but_in_love/,Feeling cramped but in love,"My bf (35M) and I (32F) have been together for about 3 years and living together for 2.5. When we first got together, we lived close to each other. We spent a lot of time together but would spend a night or two a week apart. After about 6 months though, it seemed smart for us to consolidate our bills. We love each other very much, and I love spending time with him and miss him when one or the other of us has to occasionally travel for work. We are planning on moving soon, from the west coast to the east coast of the US. 

Before we moved in together, I‚Äôd only ever lived with one other boyfriend, and to be honest it wasn‚Äôt a great experience. Otherwise, I‚Äôve either lived alone or with roommates, and have also moved around a lot. I don‚Äôt really have too many pieces of furniture that are just mine as a result. A lot of the furniture in our apartment is stuff that he‚Äôs had for years. Our bed frame, our couch, our coffee tables, our desk in our shared office, are all originally his. They‚Äôre nice pieces of furniture, too, things he has found, thrifted, restored, and so on. But there‚Äôs very little that‚Äôs mine in the apartment. Most of my possessions are things like books or clothing or art supplies, and most of that has been packed away for a while, since we‚Äôre moving in the next couple of months after many months of planning. 

When I lived alone, I also felt like it was a little easier to determine my own schedule. I used to come home from work and sometimes I would not talk to anyone at all, and just paint or write. Or sometimes I would go out, on long walks or to writing groups or to be a nerd and read in the corners of dive bars by myself. I‚Äôm pretty introverted, and like my solitude. My partner is also introverted, but he loves quality time. When he‚Äôs home, he wants to hang out by my side, even if we aren‚Äôt doing the same thing. I‚Äôve largely stopped going out. Most of the time, I love just spending time with just us two. We hike together, play games together, and we love just being in each other‚Äôs company. But recently I feel kind of cramped. I feel like our space is ‚Äúhis‚Äù or ‚Äúours,‚Äù but not mine. I‚Äôm finding it kind of difficult to write or do art more consistently, which is taking a slow toll on my mental health. 

I‚Äôm starting to fantasize about living in my own space, what it would be like to have my own couch, my own bed, a hutch for my records, etc. What it would be like to wake up on a Saturday morning and take things at exactly my own pace. I think part of this is stress from our impending move. My bf has never moved this far away from his hometown before, and he is excited and really wants to live in this new city, but I kind of have to hold his hand through each step in the process. I think the other part is that, even after 3 years, I don‚Äôt really know how to fully balance partnership and independence. I‚Äôm really frustrated at myself, because I really love my bf so much and I love our life together and all the time we do spend together, but these daydreams of living alone keep seeping in. I haven‚Äôt communicated any of this to him because I don‚Äôt want to hurt him or make him think I‚Äôm not committed when I am. He‚Äôs such a cool person, and I love him so much. I‚Äôd just like some advice on how to deal with these feelings of feeling a little cramped, or how to broach the subject to him in a way that isn‚Äôt going to make him feel panicked. 

TLDR; I love my bf but I feel cramped, how do I navigate this in a way that doesn‚Äôt make him feel upset?",1,1738624353.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

Everything feels like huge, unsurmountable burden which would taaaaaaaaaaakeeeeeeee deeeeeeecaaaaaaades to finish. I just can't. It is too much. It seems like so hard, taking sooooooo much effort. Absolutely everything. The simplest, tiniest tasks are overwhelming. Brushing teeth? Yes. I get up in the morning and I have a dirty coffee cup from the previous day. It is too hard for me to wash it. Go gym? Too far (it is less than 2 kms away). Nowhere to park my car. Public transport? Too much trouble. Lessons? I want to do so much. I was laid off from a my last position, where I was tech/cust support. I want more. I want to do more and achieve more. I want to make more money. I do not want to spend my life in a miserable, half-assed profession with no perspectives. Learning academy? Finance courses? Linux admin courses? Many more courses? I can't. Just can't for the life of me stay put for solid 2 or 3 hours and even pay attention and process information. I feel like my mind is a stale water. I could do so much more, I have the capacity. But anytime something, anything becomes a task, it is just like I have a lil toddler inside me who stomps their legs and says ""I-WONT-DO-IT"". And I really have no discipline to fight all of that on a daily basis, all time. The only thing I can put my attention to is netflix, and even that begins to wear off. Shisha? I love it. But I am too lazy to prepare one right now. Doomscrolling? Bored. Insta? Bored. Fb? Too much. So I end up bored, wanting to do something interesting, yet having multitude of things to do, which I don't want to do, but not only that, I don't want to make the effort even for the things I want. I realise this is going to get me absolutely nowhere. I will get old and having nothing. I do not want that. But honestly I do not know what to do. 

As if this was not enough, I have OCD. My mind is a mess of constant running thoughts, which most of the time I can not even make up what is it saying. I can't fix my mind on anything. I can't follow my own thoughts. One thought is too much and the next one pops up. I don't even want to finish the youtube videos about adhd. 

I sleep the whole day. I feel better and more energized at noon, after around 18o'clock, but then I don't want to do anything because it is too late. Of course I go to bed late, wake up late, and no matter how much sleep I got, I always need to sleep through the day. I may get up after 10 hours of sleep, but I will get sleepy one hour after I wake up. And then I could have some more naps after that, since I feel sleepy again.

I waste my mind energy in senseless daydreaming and mindwandering about situations which will most likely never happen.   
This is too tiring. If anyone was like that and has sucessfully beat this stuff, please let me know what did you  do. I feel like I have absolutely never functioned properly. I want out of this, and I truly hope I don't have to do anything.

Mods, please approve this post. I want desperately to relate to someone, and this is my reality. If anyhting breaks the rules, please let me know and I will fix it. I just want to see I am not alone and there is someone who relates.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Cottage home kitchens are known for their inviting warmth and rustic charm. If you‚Äôre looking to create a cozy atmosphere in your kitchen, there are countless creative ideas you can incorporate into your decor. By blending simple elements with a touch of personality, you can transform your kitchen into a beautiful, functional space.

### Natural Materials

Using natural materials is key to achieving that cottage look. Here are some ideas to help you embrace this style:

- **Wooden Accents:** Consider wooden beams on the ceiling or open shelves made from reclaimed wood. These features can instantly warm up any space.
- **Stone Elements:** Adding a stone backsplash or a feature wall can bring the outdoors in. Look for local stones to source the perfect texture.
- **Ceramic and Pottery:** Handcrafted ceramics can serve both functional and decorative purposes. Use them for your dishware or as distinct centerpieces.

### Color Palette Choices

Your color choices can dramatically affect the overall feel of your kitchen. A warm, soft color palette can help to create a serene atmosphere:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/cottage-home-kitchen-decor  
  
- **Pale Pastels:** Soft greens, blues, and yellows can evoke a sense of tranquility and are very popular in cottage decor.
- **Neutral Tones:** Whites, creams, and light grays also work well, creating a light and airy feel.
- **Bold Accents:** bolder colors through accessories or an accent wall can add character without overwhelming the space.

### Creating a Welcoming Space

To make your cottage kitchen truly inviting, focus on accessibility and comfort:

- **Cozy Seating:** A small table with comfy chairs can create a perfect nook for enjoying a morning cup of coffee. Throw cushions can add comfort.
- **Open Design:** Aim for an open layout that allows for easy movement and interaction. This creates a homey atmosphere where family and friends can gather.
- **Warm Lighting:** Use soft, warm lighting fixtures. Pendant lights with rustic finishes can help define the space and add character.

### Added Textures and Patterns

Textures and patterns can bring additional depth to your cottage kitchen. Consider the following:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/cottage-home-kitchen-decor  
  
- **Textiles:** Use tea towels, curtains, and tablecloths in natural fabrics like cotton or linen for a fresh, homey feel.
- **Patterns:** Floral or checkered patterns on fabric can add a charming, nostalgic touch. Use these for accent pillows or window treatments.

A farmhouse sink coupled with antique hardware can serve as eye-catching focal points, binding together the various elements of your decor.

Don‚Äôt forget to accessorize with items that resonate with you‚Äîhandmade ceramics, fresh flowers, or even art pieces can add the finishing touches. Lighting also plays a crucial role; try whimsical fixtures or soft, natural light to brighten the space and enhance its charm.

Still feeling great. I definitely needed to eat more today though. I had an egg for breakfast and some coffee and off course a water.  

Went to the gym. I just did 25 minutes on the treadmill at varying inclines and speeds.  A little over a mile.  Then did light arm workouts. I definitely didn't want to overdo it too fast. It's not a race. I do like the gym during the day though,  people are older and not there to look hot, they're there to work out. Many more people in baggy shirts and sweats, and no waiting for machines. Nooffensthoto those that want to look hot and socialize but i prefer to do what i need to do and get out, apart from the occasional shirt pleasantries.

Still drinking a lot of water. It's 6pm and I ate rotisserie chicken, some tuna steak, and a salad. Didn't feel like rice though I did have ranch. 

My brain is thinking of the strawberry pretzel salad in the fridge but physically don't have interest. It sounds too sweet. 

I got super tired after I ate and am trying to make it until 7 to sleep off. 

Lots of lemon water today too! I flaky took a before thing though I wish i did earlier because i am not sure if i gave one from my  HWo of 50. Or even my 236 from the doctors office the day before I started.

1ih2oqy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1ih2oqy/am_i_a_nag/,Am I a nag?,"I met my husband 4 years ago and because of circumstances he was forced to move in with me after only a couple of months of dating.
We were still in the head over heels phase so sure... I knew things would change quite soon but hear me out... 

Like most men he is a total pig. We were both working over 60hours (running a company together) so the house was always a mess, much to my despise but thats life.

Now we got married and we have  3 month old together. We decided he would do the work and I will take care of our son and the house. 

I do all the night feedings... Always .. since birth... and start the day around 6am. Before 08:30 I get dressed, take care of the baby, make the bed and lunch for my husband, do laundry/dishwasher and clean the whole downstairs.
By then he is still sleeping on the couch (we are sleeping seperate for about a year now) 
After that I walk the dogs and run errands with the stroller, clean up the laundry and start deepcleaning the designated room for the day.
He will be awake around 9/10am but most of the time he is smoking a joint and ""doing the paperwork"" (can also be playing a videogame or internet browsing) or taking a 2 hour bath. (Maybe said hello to our son but no feedings or changing diapers)

Then I need to clean up the house again... Empty soda cans everywhere in the house, torn up cigarette buds from his joint next (!!) to the ashtray, towels and dirty laundry on the bathroom floor next (!!) to the hamper, his shoes in the middle of the living room and the clothes he just took off before his bath on the kitchen chair.
He will go to work late almost everyday.
Some days I am extra lucky and he will shave his beard and leave the sink full of hairs.
Our son is still napping a lot and still needs feeding every 3/4 hours so I will be home with him all day.

Anyway, in the afternoon after I finished cleaning the house, I cook dinner, mostly eat alone and clean the kitchen and then bathe/feed/tuck in our son.
My husband comes home god knows when (because he always leaves to late he also comes home late) and quite often he will go to the gym or visit a soccer match after.
He will come home to a clean house with food prepared but most of the times he already ate some fastfood before he got home because he didnt feel like eating my food. 
Sidenote: he only eats like 6 dishes and they must be prepared accordingly or he won't eat it. 
(And the lunch I made him in the morning will still be in his car for weeks until its molded.... crusts perfectly cut off in a square shape and all)

He will smoke a joint, maybe give our son a quick hello If he is still awake, and start leaving a trail of clutter starting at he front door.
The keys/wallet etc go to the first surface he encounters, the shoes and socks in the middle of the room, the buds again next to the ashtray and he will pass out on the couch within minutes. 
When he actually does eat the food I made he will leave his plate next to his empty soda cans on the coffee table (and leave them while walking to the kitchen about 5 times for a new can)

He will not ask my about my day, he will not hug me, I am pretty sure he just tunes out when I speak because he usually interrups me and starts a completely different conversation. 

So my night will start, alone in our big bed, for a couple of hours because like I mentioned: days go by without him touching a bottle or diaper and I do the night feedings.

In the morning I need to clean al his bullshit again so I started setting up some basic fucking rules.

- I am your wife not your mom
- You can do and smoke whatever the fuck you want in your office and live in a mess I will not go there.
- If you want your clothes clean and nicely folded in your dresser then put them in the hamper
- You bring your dishes to the kitchen (I am OK with placing them on top of the fucking empty dishwasher...)
- You throw away your own trash (and you will never have to empty the bins)
- You put away the things you used
- If you make something dirty like the sink you rinse it
- You just need to whipe your own ass your wife will clean the bathroom en change the toilet paper

Now there will be days (quite often) were he will start yelling at me for being childish because I dumped all of his dirty clothes that I collected from the house into his office for example. Pretty much every time I ask him to do something he reacts like a teenager and tells me I need to relax more. To sketch an idea: he will paint a wall and leave the tools/brushes in the garden for 6months untill I clean it up.
He will change about 3 diapers a week, never walk the dogs and this was even the case when I experienced a death in my family. I had 2 nights of decent sleep in over 3 months.

I am trying to raise a son and I dont want my future daughter in law to raise her eyebrows about his upbringing.
Also the lack of intimacy is playing its part, when we do go on holiday I am literary staring at a wall in restaurants because he is only watching his phone.

We fight almost daily and the worst part is that he will always start every reply with: ""yes but you do this and that"". (Mostly he is pointing out how I used to be messy before I came a mother)
The next morning he will be cleaning up his mess because he knows I'm right but he will never have an open conversation about how this problem needs fixing let alone acknowledge his part. And after 2 days maximum the entire circus starts again.

This might come as a surprise to some but we had sex 3 times last year. One of the times our son was conceived and the other 2 times he was high/drunk.

At this point I stopped caring about the relationship completely.
And no, I dont complain to him all day. After 24 hours of staring at his mess I just clean it up with a grimm face and after a day or two I get sick of it and throw everything in his office like you would do with a teenager.

I am thankful to be financially free because of him so I can be there for my kid 24/7, but it feels like this 100+ hrs workweek is not completely fair. I wish I had time to wash my hair and he is taking baths and playing videogames.

On weekends we only do what he wants to do, and he is always critizing me.
I gave him full responsibility over our finances, and I only spend ‚Ç¨20 a week on myself. He will go and buy for hundreds of euros worth off flatscreens and stupid devices we dont need etc and complain about being broke after. (Not to mention ‚Ç¨25/50 daily on the fucking soda cans and weed)

He gained over 30kg since I met him because of all the soda and fastfood (bag of chips or full plate of fried chicken wings for breakfast is normal for him... Fuck the sandwich I made him)

Ok this turned out to be a longer post than I intented but you get the picture...

1ih2oqc,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1ih2oqc/breed_recommendation_friendly_neighborhood_and/,Breed Recommendation: friendly neighborhood and trail dog,"**Introduction**

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

\*\* This would not be my first dog. Not my first dog. I grew up with a dachshhund and Lhaso apso.  I have had 2 older rescue dogs (a doberman/whippet/plot hound mix and a lab/GSD mix). I currently have a goldendoodle and a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.

1. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a¬†[reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

\*\* Would like to good through a reputable breeder 

1. Describe your ideal dog.

\*\* I live across the street from a small park (about an acre of grass) and my house backs up to BLM trails. My ideal dog would be a fun neighborhood dog that can bump into friendly off leash dogs in the park, or hike on the trails and take seeing people, dogs, and mountain bikes in stride. It's not the environment for every dog but for some dogs it's heaven. I also like training and bonding with my dog, but I feel that most dogs that are stable and reasonably smart can be good training partners. Would also love to be able to take the dog to a brewery or a coffee shop on the weekends. 

1. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

\*\* I generally like gun dogs (retrievers, spaniels, setters). I really like people oriented, sweet and happy dogs. I also kind of like how sight hounds can be very sweet a cuddly while being super athletic. I like that toy breed dogs are breed to be friendly companions but I find that many of them have also been breed to alert bark. I don't love the herding dog stare, but I could be convinced that a herder might be good for my lifestyle. I want to stay away from any breed designed for protection, defense, gu@rding, etc

1. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

\*\* This is kind of a tough question...things I would like to train: an excellent recall, agility, trick titles. Things I would like ""built-in""  (ie come naturally, realizing ALL dogs require socialization and training): a naturally genial attitude, optimism and stability, friendliness with novel people and dogs, a natural ""off-switch"", 

1. Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock gu@rding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

\*\* I have dabbled in agility and rally and like both. I think the environment at dog competitions can be a lot for dogs and I'm hoping to find a partner that is stable enough to enjoy the dog-sport scene while also being engaged enough to play the game. In short I would rather spend my time training a less motivated dog to play the game, rather than taking a ""whiz kid"" dog and having to put a lot of energy into being able to handle the environment. 

**Care Commitments**

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

\*\* An hour of focused dog time per day, but must be able to take a sick day occasionally and not go crazy. I know young dogs may need more for a few years, but I'd like to do an hour for maintaining adult dogs. 

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

\*\* 3-4 times a week long off-leash hiking. Daily walks or training sessions. 

9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

\*\* Grooming is not an issue. I can manage any brushing, clipping, bathing for the right personality. 

**Personal Preferences**

10) What size dog are you looking for?

\*\* Would love a 25-35lbs size. My Cavalier is a little too small but I'd love to be able to pick the dog up and carry them out if an injury occurs on the trails. Must be under 50 lbs max 

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

\*\* Shedding is not an issue at all. I have a low tolerance for barking which has pulled me away from breed like shelties and  Havanese in the past. Not a big fan of slobber. 

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

\*\* Extremely important! But I don't want to necessarily rule out sight hounds as I have access to some safe (away from roads and hazards) and open fields within a few minutes drive of my house. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

\*\* My sweet spot is a dog that wants to lay at my feet or be near me. I'd rather take a dog that wants to sleep on my face over a dog that wants to sleep outside though. 

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that‚Äôs more eager-to-please?

\*\* I like a dog to be pretty into people.

15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

\*\* I want a ""never met a stranger"" type dog. Excited barking is ok, but I do NOT want a gu@rd dog. 

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

\*\* Been there, done that...and not going back

17) Are there any other behaviors you can‚Äôt deal with or want to avoid?

\*\* I don't like really pushy dogs. Some of the most painful experiences I've had with a dog are with super friendly pitties or labs that accidently maul you with love. I like a little more sensitivity and grace. 

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

\*\* Occasionally my partner and I have shifts where we're both working the same day, but rarely. Would need to be able to go 8 hours on occasion, but usually on 4-5 hours regularly. 

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

\*\* Partner is all in and we align in our preferences. The dog must be good with children. 

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

\*\* Also have cats which must be respected

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

\*\* Yes 

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

\*\* Own a house

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

\*\* No breed bans

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

\*\* Mountains: cold winters and hot summers

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

\*\* I LOVE my both my dogs. My goldendoodle is a worrier and we've worked a lot on getting confident. He's settling into himself now that's he's 6, but still requires management to keep him living his best life.  My cavalier is simply fantastic. He's young and not particularly healthy now and I know it will get worse. I actively prioritized behavioral health over physical health when I got him...my question is can I have both?

1ih2mea,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ih2mea,Help With Color Scheme and Set Up Ideas!,"Just moved into a bigger apartment with a lot more living room space, got rid of our sectional and got this couch that I am in love with that is an Apricot color. 

The only problem is that now, we don‚Äôt have enough seating for guests (which we have 2-4 people over often) and the space just looks empty. 

I have absolutely 0 idea for design and wasn‚Äôt thinking ahead when I got the couch outside of the fact that we love color and dont want a traditional black/white/grey. 

Our kitchen is right next to the LR, and has dark wood countertops that match the tv stand and coffee table and we plan to get matching end tables as well. 

What colors/what set up would go well for additional seating? If it helps, our kitchen countertops/island are white and most of our kitchen decorations are pink. 

Any advice is appreciated!! Mostly concerned about the additional seating as a priority right now but would also love other ideas to bring the space to life. ",1,1738623168.0,HomeDecorating,1,1.0,False

I'm also an Autistic college dropout who hasn't had a social life in ages, so I have legitimately forgotten how to talk to people like a normal human being. I have a job, which gives me plenty of opportunities to make friends with male and female coworkers, but I don't enjoy talking to them because they've probably already dismissed me as the resident idiot of the store, and I don't want to gain a reputation as the ingratiating creep who keeps randomly talking to his female coworkers. I hang around coffee shops and occasionally glance at people, but I never say hi or strike up a conversation because, again, I don't want to be the local weirdo who gets escorted out. Do people even talk to each other in public places without drinking themselves into a stupor, or is that just Hollywood fiction? ",7,1738623157.0,dating_advice,16,0.82,False
