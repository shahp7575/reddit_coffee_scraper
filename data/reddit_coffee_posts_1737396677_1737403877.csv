Hey everyone! 👋

I’m Mohamed, 33, based in Cairo. I work as a freelance producer, mostly in the Esports scene (if you’re into gaming, hit me up!). Recently, I wrapped up producing the biggest Esports show in history, which was an incredible experience.

Outside of work, I’m into walking (I’ve been using a walking pad lately and love it!), trying to stay active after years of being a couch potato. 😅 I’m also a big fan of coffee, tech, and gaming. Bonus points if you can beat me at Beat Saber or want to geek out about VR! 🎮

Personality-wise, I’d say I’m thoughtful, spontaneous, and open-minded. I’ve been on a journey of self-improvement and reflection, and I’m big on meaningful conversations and growth. Oh, and I have a fluffy Persian cat named Yukkie who’s the boss of the house. 🐾

Looking for someone kind, curious, and full of good vibes. Whether it’s gaming together, deep talks, or just exploring the city, I’d love to get to know you.

Feel free to drop a message if this sounds like your vibe! 😊",1,1737403839.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

(Skip 5 lines down if you do not wish to read a huge story and get straight to the question/information about the specific Macintosh 512k I have).

Growing up, I’ve always had an affinity of history especially the history of technology and how far it’s come to keep my mind refreshed about the current state of technology and how far it’s advanced.

I usually watch videos on YouTube about old tech like cameras, phones, computers, etc.

Recently I watched “Teaching an Old Mac New Tricks” by Hunter Irving, and I was hooked!  It was everything I could’ve wanted, two completely different worlds of technology colliding!

I always envisioned having one myself in my home and to take with me to local coffee shops to have another form of writing on a computer but this time with an conventional machine compared to the common laptop or iPad people walk in with.  Yes It was most likely a vision thought up of for the means of a public stunt for laughs, but overtime I got more serious about art and writing and figured that maybe using a uncommon device in a public setting might leave me in a more focused scenario.

I have no idea if anything Hunter Irving did to his model in his YouTube video will work on mine for it’s a different model.  Even if not I wanna know exactly what I need/should have for my model, and exactly the kind of things I can do with it.

It came with its keyboard, mouse, and power cord but that’s all.  When it’s powered on, the mouse works but it just shows a floppy disk with an “X” on it, I know nothing inside and out these machines or what else might be wrong with it, will be asking and answering all the questions moving forward!!!

Now I like Brad very much and have known him for many years as he is my oldest son's  best friend and he and Derrick are the same age. Apparently Johanna ran into Bad during summer break when she and her girlfriends took a graduation trip from their college campus to England. Johanna has always wanted to go to England and I was so excited for her. She ran into Brad \[36m\] who has lived there pretty much his whole life, and who my son Derrick met when he was 21 at the Naval base when he was stationed in England overseas; at a coffee-shop and the two got to talking and reminiscing about old times.

That was back in December and now she called the other day saying her and Brad are dating and he wants to marry her. Now part of me is thrilled for her sand I want her to be happy but there is another part of me that is slightly concerned for various reasons. The first of which being Brad's age and status as a widower \[first wife died in a car accident about ten years ago\] the second being this man has enjoyed his youth while my daughter is still learning she just graduated and the third being that he has known Johanna since she was six. He and my oldest served together and he was often at my house for holidays and things like that over the years, just whenever he was in town.

I brought this up to my daughter, siting that, while I know that she is grown, I kinda feel weird that she is A dating her brother's best friend and B that maybe they should slow down. I'm not saying break up and if he is the one for her then he is the one. But maybe do not get engaged after two months of dating. Wait I don't know, a year, maybe two? My daughter heard me but pointed out that her father and I have been married for 38yrs come august and he is ten years older than me.  And she is right, but I again told her I did not say that she couldn't be with Brad just that she might take it a bit slower than this? I told her I love them, both of them and I wanted to see them both happy but privately I cannot help but thinking, did he just wait for my daughter to grow up so they could be together?

I know that is a terrible thing to say or think and I feel awful, but I can't tell if this is this just puppy love or is it the real thing. Yes may-December relationships are a thing and I want more than anything for my daughter to be happy in life.  I am not sure how to approach this and so am just needing to tell the void so I can get it out. Any advice on how to deal with my doubts while not hurting my child would be appreciated thank you all so much, please help me as the last thing I want to do is hurt anyone involved.

TLDR: My 21yr old daughter has been dating her 36yr old brother's best friend for 2 months and wants to marry him and I cannot help but feel a little weirded out.",1,1737403621.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False
1i5zlid,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIndianWomen/comments/1i5zlid/need_help_with_sil/,Need help with SIL,"My sil is pretty lovely. We have a good bond. I call her up to talk about all my problems. We share the like for several typical girly things like shopping and doing skincare.

I have a different bond with my brother. We have our inside jokes. My sil pointed out once that she doesn’t understand a log of things when I talk to my brother. It’s mostly just quotes from the several shows we watched together. We naturally try to include her in the conversation as best as we can, but there’s a limit to it. I usually just call them up separately depending on what I wanted to discuss, or who would be free at that time.

Now one thing that has always bothered me is that whenever I call my brother, he would be on loud speaker and sil will be listening to everything. I have made jokes about it to my brother like ‘should I repeat the story for sil or did she already hear everything’. They would also just laugh it off but they still do it. Everytime I had asked my brother to come see me, she would join, even if it was inconvenient for everyone to include her in the plan. It’s not like I don’t enjoy hanging out with her, but it becomes annoying to go out of our way to make sure she’s there even if its just a half an hour coffee meet. 

Recently my brother called me and she immediately ran inside the room and called him for dinner, in a very alarming manner. Then I later called him again and she again ran in with something to say. He blew her off. He has mentioned the issue he faces with her clinginess, and he has tried to reason with her in the past, but hasn’t worked.

She belongs to a state which is notoriously known for trying to separate the man from his family, but apart from this one thing, she has shown a lot of attachment to my family, which cannot be a show all throughout these years. 

I don’t want to cause any drama for obvious reasons, but I also don’t want to be cut off from my brother who has been my best friend since birth. Any suggestions?",1,1737403582.0,AskIndianWomen,0,1.0,False

These vibrant drinks are not just a trend; they serve significant nutritional benefits that can support your overall wellness. Let’s explore some of the amazing benefits of incorporating superfood smoothies into your daily routine.

### Rich in Nutrients

Superfood smoothies are packed with vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. By blending ingredients like spinach, kale, and berries, you create a nutrient-dense drink that can help bridge the gap in your daily nutritional needs. For example:

This combination helps boost your immunity and supports your body's natural functions.

### Incorporate Different Greens

While spinach and kale are popular choices, think beyond the usual greens. Consider adding:

-&gt;Want a delicious Smoothie Recipe for every day of the year? Click here to get your '365 Delicious Smoothie Recipes' book- https://hownow101.com/365-smoothie-guide

1i5zi3h,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1i5zi3h/50_shades/,50 shades.,"Warning: This post may offend some with sensibilities to sexual content, perceived misogyny, or just anything because nowadays people are overly sensitive. I have worked with mostly women for the last 28 years so any perception that I hate them is just silly. Also my assumptions of your behavior are not based on nothing, I have heard all your secrets and watched all your behaviors, and understood that its a see what they do not what they say game. But this is my candid account, as a man, of what happened. I'm telling the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.

I was recently talking to a woman who I work with. We will call her Tina (not her real name). I know I know don't shit where you eat, got it. I work in a gigantic hospital and rarely see her because we both float to different units. Tina asked me how dating was going and I told her I didn't date. Tina replied, ""You are gorgeous, why not.” So I said give me your number and we can talk.

She gave me her number and we started texting daily and flirting over texts. When we saw each other at work we would lightly flirt but not let on to others that we liked each other. We talked on the phone occasionally. We talked about going to dinner and a movie traditional easy first date.

I have to preface this next part by saying that we live in Los Angeles, one of the most ruthless and expensive places to live so finances are an issue to all of us. For those who may think we are materialistic, we are not, we are trying to survive in a harsh environment. The stakes are high and taking on the wrong partner could land you in a tent on the side of the freeway. She told me about her living situation which was not good, living with mom and adult daughter in a one bedroom apartment. Daughter seemed lost and dependent. Also sounded broke Af which is a turnoff because we are 50, get your shit together. Major red flags for me.

We talked about going to dinner and a movie traditional easy first date somewhere nice then movie after. Maybe some light touching during the movie, a kiss, whatever. I wasn't feeling too great about her living situation and I made up an excuse to break our first date which she got really butt hurt for and for about three weeks would tell me she's busy or that she had a date. Most likely a lie, because Tina would intermittently lash out and say that she couldn't believe I broke our first date.

That's fine, the little white lies women tell to shit test you are just part of the game to me. She also made a comment that she was supposed to be ""dating to marry"" at this age. What kinda dating were you doing before that? She of course asked me if I was willing to get married again and I said perhaps. Now I know ladies want a man who is ""dating with intention"" but asking a man if they want to get married is the equivalent of me running up to you at 14 years old and saying ""will you be my girlfriend""over and over. I'm not going to commit to you before I know you because I don't know you and you will have to wait and see. If you are too impatient I figure you are not worth it.

So every now and then we would work together and the sexual tension between us was clear. She would brush up against me or I would her. She showed signs of being a good woman like once she brought me coffee when I complained there wasn't any in the breakroom. Little gestures like that speak volumes to me.

One day while texting, the question came up: are you a good kisser, then moved to do you like your neck kissed and she said that made her ""wet"". This is where it escalated quickly. She showed me the porn that she was watching and sent me a picture of her ""toy"". Ok I'm not some prude but let's be real, probably not a good move to take it to this level before I even take you out on a date. Now you have created so much sexual tension that we might as well get that out of the way first.

Now we have been sexting every now and then. She’s sending me half naked pictures all the time. Me doing my best 50 shades impressions for her. Then she pulls the typical bullshit. “I usually go out with someone at least 16 dates before sex.”, “what happened to dinner and a movie?” Trying to roll things back. I’m like “Tina we are way beyond some boring ass dinner at a boring ass restaurant when you know we just want to tear each other’s clothes off, we might as well get that over with first and work backwards from there” so Am I the asshole for feeling this way? I don’t think so she made her bed now lie in it or don’t doesn’t really matter to me.

Now, before I dive into this, let me paint the picture. Alhamdulilah, I’m conventionally attractive, tall, and have a good career. I’m not saying this to brag—it’s all from Allah—but just to give you some context. I’m not coming at this from a place of bitterness or struggle. I’ve had options, and that’s exactly what has allowed me to see the patterns I’m about to share with you.

People often say, “Avoid high-maintenance girls—they’re too difficult and not worth it.” But over time, I’ve realized two key things:

1)  “High maintenance” is not real. A girls “maintenance” directly reflects how much she’s into you. If a girl genuinely likes you, she won’t make you jump through unnecessary hoops. How much she likes you and how difficult she makes things for you are inversely proportional. 

2) A LOT of women will give a chance to a guy who they do not really like or at a time when they’re not really interested in marriage. Women are often taught to marry the guy who is good on paper (religious, can provide, etc.) over the guy who makes their heart race or who they feel an undeniable connection with. In short, a lot of women (not all) will marry a guy who will make a good husband, not a guy they like. 


I promise you, that girl who makes you jump through hoops and plays hard to get does NOT fw you as much as you fw her. From you she’ll require more expensive and frequent gifts and dates, she’ll will not give you the same grace and room for error as she would another man, she will play hard to get and not communicate clearly the way she would another man. And when the time comes to wrap things up, she will stand her ground on everything and not compromise on anything. For you it’s a 30k mehr and a extravagant wedding or hit the road, for the guy she actually is infatuated with it’s a umrah trip and a nikkah at the mosque. 


l once asked a girl out and after texting a few a days I asked her if she wanted to go to this coffe/bakery place that I like on a first date, and she said a coffee date was too low effort for her. You know what I did? I ended things right then and there. She wasn’t “high maintenance” she just did not like me that much. And that’s fine, not every girl will like me, just like how I don’t like every girl. But the difference between men and women is that we almost always only go after women we actually like while women often will give you a shot even if they don’t like you like that.

Neither of them seem to have any idea of what to try next and have basically told me I need to just adjust my diet to try to figure it out myself.

  
My symptoms have lasted over a year now, and I was diagnosed with a very small sliding HH by barium swallow but it was not seen on endoscopy. I've had all the blood tests, X-rays, biopsies, gallbladder ultrasound, and orthostatic BP test. The only abnormalities found were the small hernia, mildly low vitamin D (within normal though, and I've had low vitamin D in the past and that felt very different), and at my last appt my glucose was low at 65 in the morning, unfasted (after breakfast). The GI nurse practitioner has repeatedly said the HH is not the cause of my symptoms because it's so small. 

  
I'm currently on 40mg pantoprazole in the morning and at night, 10mg lexapro, multivitamin, and vitamin d. Adding the pantoprazole at night has not helped much. I'm on my second gluten free trial, the first one maybe helped vomiting a bit but inconclusive. No coffee, smoking, alcohol, soda, tomatoes. I'm vegan, 5'10"" 140 lbs, active but have quit weightlifting due to nausea during workouts.

  
My main symptoms:

* Vomiting multiple times a week in the morning after breakfast, usually when I'm waking up early (about 30 occasions in past 3 months)
* Acid reflux into throat after eating (but never heartburn) and burping a lot 
* Feeling like food is stuck behind sternum after eating/needing to drink water to get food down
* Nausea and vomiting after intense exercise like weightlifting or sprints
* Bad motion sickness in the car like I've never had before
* Some lightheadedness, shakiness, fatigue, etc. in morning, during exercise

  
If anyone has experienced similar symptoms with small sliding hernia or has any suggestions about how to talk to my doctors going forward that would be much appreciated. I'm planning on buying a cheap glucometer to get a better idea of what my glucose looks like when I throw up in the morning or while working out. Is my specialist right and my hernia is too small to cause all this? Could it be eosinophilic esophagitis (I never had esophageal biopsies)? Hypoglycemia?

Around three years ago (June 2022) I moved into an apartment at a luxury complex. At the time I was moving cross country so I had no furniture. The complex did offer rental furniture packages for an extra $200/month. To say it was worth it is an understatement, they gave me a king bed (with linens), cookware (pots, pans, measuring cups, flatware), a TV, desk, multiple living room pieces (couch, extra chair, coffee table, wall mounted tv with a console below), wall furniture, literally everything you could imagine. Even linens and outdoor furniture for the small balcony. It was a great deal and besides a few pieces (my own TV which I moved with, a dresser for the closet, miscellaneous storage things, and a bedroom unit to place the TV they gave me) I dont own any of the furniture in my apartment. Over the course of the last two and a half years or so, I’ve acquired different furniture pieces (mostly kitchen stuff — cups, new cookware, etc) but otherwise still have nothing to my name. Last year around April our building was bought out by a new company. I’m moving out when my lease is up this year, mainly to move in with my boyfriend but also because the new management is awful. They’re careless and inattentive and I genuinely dislike what my building has become. 

I’m not really attached to any of the furniture in my apartment except for my bed. It’s a king sized bed and it is perfectly comfortable for me. I don’t care about any of the other furniture in the unit and would gladly leave it all behind, plus my boyfriend has enough furniture for us (until we decide to supplement with more stuff). Last year whenever I was resigning my lease (which they didn’t give to me until two days before my renewal date, which I’m pretty sure was breach of contract), I causally brought up the fact that I rented furniture. The woman assisting me (who I believe quit shortly thereafter) made the comment that it’s technically not their furniture since I was renting from the prior leasing company. In reviewing my past leases, I noticed that there was actually no mention of the furniture in anything I signed. It was mostly a verbal agreement, with one email I have that was very informal and I don’t think would be considered a contract. 

My question comes up here : what should I do whenever I submit my 60 day notice regarding the furniture? Should I bring it up to the apartment complex, or not say anything?

I really do not want to keep any of my furniture other than my king bed. A huge reason I rented furniture was so I wouldn’t have to deal with any big move out projects. My ideal scenario is to just take the bed and mattress, and leave everything else behind. I don’t want to get charged for dumping or abandoning this furniture even though I technically don’t own it, and I definitely don’t want to be charged for the king bed. Some friends have suggested I sell whatever furniture I can or list on Facebook marketplace for free, but I feel like that’s also a grey area and something I don’t want to risk. 

Doing the math I’ve paid $7.2k over the course of three years on top of my rent for all of this furniture. I would honestly pay a couple hundred bucks to have my ideal scenario (keep the bed and leave the rest) but I don’t even know if it’s worth bringing up. Any advice or words of wisdom from anyone who went through something similar? Thanks in advance. 

TLDR : moving out in a few months from a Unit with rented furniture, new management company states it “technically isn’t their furniture”, I just want to keep one item, what should I do?

I'm planning on getting a Lelit Anna PID. I'm not sure what grinder I should get with it yet, mostly because I don't know what the best approach would be.

Generally speaking, would you go for something more entry level (like e.g. a Sage Smart Grinder, Fellow Opus, Lelit Fred..., maybe even used as entry level stuff is quite available) and upgrade later or would you rather have the high upfront investment (up to 400€ in e.g. a Eureka Mignon, DF54, Varia VS3, Mahlkönig X54...)?

As you might have guessed from the wide range of grinders i named, I'm not sure which features would suit me best. My argument for an entry level grinder is to find out what I need/want in a grinder, e.g. if I can make single dosing work or how often I change the grind setting (my current guess is that I sometimes change it from espresso to a coarser café crème).

On the other hand, not feeling the need to upgrade would also be great.

How did you solve this problem for yourself or what would you do in my situation? What features do you not want to miss, what features do you find unnecessary?

I'm new to home espresso (currently rocking a moka pot) and am looking forward to experimenting and enjoying great cups of coffee.

Some other key facts:

* I'm guessing (!) that I'll be making 2-4 cups a day, and I'd probably mix between espresso and milk drinks, maybe even café crème.
* I have some counter space, but would prefer something with a smaller footprint like the Lelit Anna.
* I would like to get an electric grinder.
* I'm in Germany, budget for a grinder up to \~400€.

I hosted plenty of social events and was likewise regularly invited to birthday parties, overnight trips, housewarmings, and even two weddings right after graduation.

But despite a huge chunk of my MBA classmates still living in NYC even several years out from graduation, and despite randomly bumping into them all the time and having pretty friendly interactions—whether on the street, at coffee shops, concerts, or restaurants—my actual genuine friendships with most of them have faded.

Today, my actual social circle is made up of current coworkers I enjoy hanging out with, undergrad friends who moved to NYC and I reconnected with, pre-MBA co-workers who also ended up here, and a small amount of MBA classmates I still do keep in touch with. Surprisingly, many of my closest friends now are people I only met in the past 2-3 years—whether through things like run club, soccer, or friends of my girlfriend. At my last birthday party, most attending weren’t former CBS classmates but people I met more recently. Funny enough, my closest friend right now is someone I randomly met at a concert a few years ago, who happened to have gone to Wharton 10 years ago.

When I chose to stay in NYC post-MBA, I thought I’d maintain strong, lasting ties with my CBS friends and that we'd continue hanging out regularly. But that didn’t happen. I’ve realized over time that I don’t always vibe with the stereotypical MBA type, at least in terms of long-term friendships. They were super fun to party with, but often not the best for deep, vulnerable conversations. As a product manager in tech, I find myself clicking more with coworkers—PMs from other teams and even software engineers—who bring a different energy that I resonate with more.

I also feel that many of my MBA friendships, while meaningful at the time, were somewhat transactional. Despite all the shared experiences—traveling, partying, and even moments of slight vulnerability—only a few connections were based on genuine common interests and values. Those friendships that did last were built through repeated moments of mutual reciprocity, where it made sense we'd be friends even outside the MBA bubble.

Another thing I’ve noticed is that compared to the real world, the MBA environment felt more cliquey and it was harder to build friendships across different backgrounds. In contrast, my post-MBA life in NYC has brought me into a much more diverse social scene—whether through work, hobbies, or my girlfriend, who is a professional dancer and in a completely different world from mine.

That said, I have no regrets about my CBS experience. It was an incredible time, I had a ton of fun, learned a lot, and it turbocharged my career. I’m on good terms with most of my classmates, and I know they’d help if I ever needed a referral, and vice versa. But our relationships have clearly shifted from being “friends” to more of an acquaintance or networking dynamic.

These days, my interactions with them are mostly limited to occasional alumni chat groups. Or as I mentioned, bumping into them randomly in NYC. They're always warm and friendly: we'll smile and hug each other, and do small talk for a minute or so. Sometimes we like each others' posts or stories on Instagram. But beyond that, there's not much really there.

Curious if others have had a similar experience? Did your social life evolve differently than you expected post-MBA?",6,1737402290.0,MBA,6,0.8,False

Since then, every time I wake up feeling sick, I skip my morning coffee. That inevitably leads to me feeling 100x worse.

I've finally decided I can't live like this anymore, but idk how to stop. I tried half-caf once when I was having stomach issues, and I ended up in the hospital because my digestive system stopped working properly and exacerbated the original problem.

I knew I had to act fast. I had to find a way to contact my ex-situationship because he would grapple at the opportunity to see me, even if it meant a 6 hour drive. So I put on my old work uniform, drove 45 minutes and pretended I had a temporary job at the supermarket opposite the coffee shop where he worked (I used to work for the same company when we were together previously). I went into his work to ""buy lunch on my break"", struck up a conversation and arranged to meet him that night. Fast-forward, we're in my car and he tells me how much he's missed me and loves me (4 times), so I said it back begrudgingly before throwing my pity party about how my lift to the airport had bailed so I wouldn't be able to have a summer holiday this year. He took pity and insisted he took the day off to do the 6 hour round trip himself. I entertain his speech about us making it work, and then be on my way. A few days later, on the drive to the airport, my friend in the back seat mentioned another guy I had been seeing, and he gave me the silent treatment for the rest of the journey. 4 days before we were due to get back, I texted him saying due to his behaviour in the car (and the fact he searched my map coordinates into Grindr so he could find me whilst on holiday) I couldn't see myself with him.

She has been the bane of my existence since the beginning of our five year relationship. They have a close bond. Too close in my opinion that we never became a unit. We never truly became husband and wife. It was husband vs wife/MIL. Every time she came to visit, it ended up with my wife and I fighting. EVERY TIME WITHOUT FAIL. 

Everything was going well between my wife and I until the MIL came over for the millionth time. 

Morning:
	• I began the day with my children, spending time together and getting donuts. I also purchased coffee for my then-wife and returned home. The atmosphere was calm and positive.
	• I reminded her of my need to study, which we had previously agreed upon due to my demanding medical school schedule.
    - I would transition from my little office to the upstairs play area to watch my kids from time to time. My son would watch TV on his iPad while I studied from time to time. 

Afternoon/Evening:
	• My then-wife and the children went to the aquarium and returned in the evening. I later learned there had been tension in the car due to comments made by her mom. I was unaffected.  
	• A gathering was planned that evening for family members to watch a football game. I was informed about the gathering and stated that I would remain upstairs to focus on my studies.
	• The gathering began, and I went to bed at approximately 8:30 PM to prepare for waking up early for work. I had an especially rough chief and wanted to be prepared for rounds. My daughter was in her crib at the time and my son was playing with the guests children. 

Nighttime Incident:
	• Around 10:00 PM, my son entered my room after being told to sleep there as a form of discipline. Im not sure what he did but it involved one of the guests kids. 
	• Despite a text message asking my then-wife to lower the noise, the party downstairs grew louder, disrupting my daughter’s sleep as well. I went downstairs briefly for milk to help her get back to bed. I transitioned her next to me and my son. 
	• At approximately 12:30 AM, loud movement and commotion began in the hallway upstairs as the party wound down. My then-wife, who appeared intoxicated, entered the bedroom, turned on the lights, and began yelling. She ignored my requests to turn off the lights and left the room to her mother’s. I then closed the door and locked it. 
	• Approximately 10–20 minutes later, she returned and began banging on the locked bedroom door, yelling, “Are you serious?” I unlocked the door to address the situation, and she began yelling profanities and telling me to return to bed.
	• To de-escalate, I placed my hands on her shoulders briefly and stated, “I only have 3 hours of sleep left.” I immediately let go, and she went to the bathroom within our bedroom and got changed for the night.
	•Shortly afterward, she returned and pulled our daughter by the legs out of my bed, struggling to hold her upright. This caused our daughter to scream and cry, calling for me. My then-wife stumbled back to her mother’s room with our daughter, leaving her visibly upset.
	•The commotion continued, with additional noise and someone vomiting in the bathroom. By this point, it was approximately 1:30 AM.

I’m under so much stress and wished she respected me enough to know that it’s not okay to make so much noise when i have to be up at 3:30 am. I’ve never placed my hands on anyone before. I’ve never threatened anyone before. I just wanted to be heard. I don’t even like screaming. I’ve always believed if something isn’t going to bother me in 5 mins let it go, it’s not worth the trouble.  Her husband wanted to be heard and chosen over her mom. I have to study, I don’t want to study. Now I have to face a life where I won’t get to see my kids faces every morning.

I met *Berenice* in high school. She had this radiant smile that lit up any room and an optimistic, magnetic presence. But beneath her cheerful demeanor, she was a thinker, a natural leader who could command a room without raising her voice. I admired her immensely, though I was far too shy to approach her for years. While she was popular and surrounded by friends, many of whom weren’t exactly kind to me, she treated me with respect. That kindness was what drew me to her initially, but what really captured me were the conversations.

We’d talk about politics, science, philosophy—things that no one else in our class seemed to care about. She wasn’t just beautiful; she was brilliant. I fell for her completely, even though I knew deep down that I didn’t stand a chance.

As high school drew to a close, I couldn’t keep my feelings bottled up anymore. One afternoon, trembling with nerves, I approached her. Just as I started to speak, her friends appeared, snickering and whispering. My voice faltered, and before I could finish, she laughed. Not a nervous or kind laugh—just loud, unfiltered amusement. I don’t remember much after that except running away, humiliated.

Berenice dated a friend of mine shortly after, though their relationship was short-lived. I spent those final weeks of high school in a haze of embarrassment, wishing I could undo everything. That moment stayed with me for years, a vivid scar that shaped how I saw myself and how I approached relationships.

Fast forward a few years. One rushed morning on my way to university, I decided to take an alternate route. And there she was, like a scene out of a movie. Berenice. She greeted me like no time had passed, as if nothing had ever gone wrong between us. We talked and laughed, and for a moment, the weight of my high school heartbreak lifted.

But just as quickly as she reappeared, she was gone. I hadn’t even thought to ask for her number, and I spent the next few weeks altering my commute, hoping to see her again. I never did.

Five years later, fate decided to intervene. I bumped into her again, but this time, she wasn’t alone—she was carrying a child. I assumed she was married, but there was no partner in sight. We spent an afternoon at a park, talking and laughing like old friends. My heart raced as I worked up the courage to ask her out. This time, I was direct, determined not to let fear stop me. But her answer was the same: no. She said she’d rather we stayed friends.

Though I respected her decision, the rejection stung. We stayed in touch over the years, messaging occasionally, but our dynamic became increasingly complicated. One day, she admitted feeling guilty about how she had rejected me in high school. To my surprise, she asked me out, flipping the script on our history.

Our first outing was awkward but memorable. We went to see a movie, and though the tension between us was palpable, I kept my distance. Afterward, she seemed genuinely happy, and we agreed to meet again. Our second outing, to a restaurant, was better—until I accidentally spilled my drink on her. I expected her to be upset, but she just laughed, brushing it off like it was nothing. In that moment, I felt myself falling for her all over again.

But things took a strange turn. She began sharing personal stories about her life, including details about her past relationships. It was as though she wanted to be open with me, yet she kept me at arm’s length. She’d say things that made me feel special, then pull away entirely. I couldn’t make sense of it.

Determined to get clarity, I decided that our next meeting would be definitive—I’d tell her exactly how I felt and ask her where we stood. But that meeting never came. Three times, she canceled on me, each time with a new excuse. The last time, she left me waiting outside a theater, claiming she’d gotten sick after eating something spicy. Whether or not it was true didn’t matter. What hurt was that she hadn’t told me earlier, leaving me standing there like a fool.

By then, I was exhausted. I couldn’t keep chasing someone who seemed to delight in keeping me at a distance. I moved on, met someone else, got married, and had a child. But even then, Berenice reappeared in my life at random intervals. It was as if the universe kept throwing us together, though nothing ever came of it.

One day, over a decade later, I noticed that she’d liked an old photo of mine on social media. We started chatting, and she suggested meeting for coffee. My marriage was struggling at the time, and I couldn’t help but wonder if this was fate giving me one last chance to figure out what could have been.

The night before, I was a mess of nerves, just like I had been in high school. But when the morning came, she stopped responding. No explanations, no apologies—just silence. I went to the café anyway, clinging to a sliver of hope. But as I sat there, sipping my coffee, it became painfully clear that she wasn’t coming.

That morning, as I sat in the café, staring into the swirl of my coffee, I felt the weight of two decades of what-ifs and almosts pressing down on me. The chair across from me remained empty, and with each passing minute, I felt the sharp sting of reality. It wasn’t just about Berenice anymore—it was about all the dreams, the hopes, and the endless cycles of trying to rewrite a past that refused to change.

As I sipped my coffee, a single tear slipped down my cheek, carrying with it the sadness of all the moments I had held onto for far too long. And yet, in that stillness, there was also a strange kind of release. The pain was raw, but it was real, and it reminded me that I was still here, still standing. For the first time in what felt like years, I allowed myself to simply feel, and in that moment, I began to let go.",2,1737401874.0,MarkNarrations,0,1.0,False

Not only has it happened, it seems to happen at a pretty high rate (I would estimate ~50% or more). I usually think yep, I could do far better at home. 

I use a Rok espresso press and a baratza ESP grinder and good beans. It’s not that hard or expensive to make SOLID espresso drinks. I’m untrained, relatively inexperienced, and using a pretty cheap setup. Why don’t most coffee shops do better?!?! 

Spending a day or two properly training baristas and ensuring good beans are being used would literally solve all the issues. Most coffee shops could even DOWNGRADE the machine they use and be totally fine. 

I know this sounds like a rant, and it partially is, but I also genuinely don’t understand why so many coffee shops fail so miserably. Does anyone who has worked at shops have insight?

At the time I was moving cross country so I had no furniture. The complex did offer rental furniture packages for an extra $200/month. To say it was worth it is an understatement, they gave me a king bed (with linens), cookware (pots, pans, measuring cups, flatware), a TV, desk, multiple living room pieces (couch, extra chair, coffee table, wall mounted tv with a console below), wall furniture, literally everything you could imagine. Even linens and outdoor furniture for the small balcony. It was a great deal and besides a few pieces (my own TV which I moved with, a dresser for the closet, miscellaneous storage things, and a bedroom unit to place the TV they gave me) I dont own any of the furniture in my apartment. Over the course of the last two and a half years or so, I’ve acquired different furniture pieces (mostly kitchen stuff — cups, new cookware, etc) but otherwise still have nothing to my name. Last year around April our building was bought out by a new company. I’m moving out when my lease is up this year, mainly to move in with my boyfriend but also because the new management is awful. They’re careless and inattentive and I genuinely dislike what my building has become. 

I’m not really attached to any of the furniture in my apartment except for my bed. It’s a king sized bed and it is perfectly comfortable for me. I don’t care about any of the other furniture in the unit and would gladly leave it all behind, plus my boyfriend has enough furniture for us (until we decide to supplement with more stuff). Last year whenever I was resigning my lease (which they didn’t give to me until two days before my renewal date, which I’m pretty sure was breach of contract), I causally brought up the fact that I rented furniture. The woman assisting me (who I believe quit shortly thereafter) made the comment that it’s technically not their furniture since I was renting from the prior leasing company. In reviewing my past leases, I noticed that there was actually no mention of the furniture in anything I signed. It was mostly a verbal agreement, with one email I have that was very informal and I don’t think would be considered a contract. 

My question comes up here : what should I do whenever I submit my 60 day notice regarding the furniture? Should I bring it up to the apartment complex, or not say anything?

I really do not want to keep any of my furniture other than my king bed. A huge reason I rented furniture was so I wouldn’t have to deal with any big move out projects. My ideal scenario is to just take the bed and mattress, and leave everything else behind. I don’t want to get charged for dumping or abandoning this furniture even though I technically don’t own it, and I definitely don’t want to be charged for the king bed. Some friends have suggested I sell whatever furniture I can or list on Facebook marketplace for free, but I feel like that’s also a grey area and something I don’t want to risk. 

Doing the math I’ve paid $7.2k over the course of three years on top of my rent for all of this furniture. I would honestly pay a couple hundred bucks to have my ideal scenario (keep the bed and leave the rest) but I don’t even know if it’s worth bringing up. Any advice or words of wisdom from anyone who went through something similar? Thanks in advance. 

TLDR : moving out in a few months from a Unit with rented furniture, new management company states it “technically isn’t their furniture”, I just want to keep one item, what should I do? ",1,1737401691.0,renting,1,1.0,False

","I was sitting at my desk, staring at the mountain of unfinished tasks piling up like a to-do list from hell.

**That’s when I found what I now call my secret weapon.**

At first, I was skeptical. I’d tried countless supplements promising to fix my low energy, sharpen my focus, or magically help me drop those stubborn pounds. Nothing ever lived up to the hype. But something about this product caught my attention. Maybe it was the science-backed ingredients. Maybe it was the glowing testimonials that felt like they were written by people who’d been exactly where I was. Or maybe it was just desperation. Either way, I decided to give it a shot.

**Fast forward three months, and my life has completely transformed.**

The first thing I noticed was the energy. Not the jittery, crash-prone energy you get from caffeine or sugary drinks. This was clean, sustained energy that powered me through the day like a finely tuned engine. I woke up feeling refreshed—something I hadn’t experienced in years—and stayed focused and productive from morning until night.

And the mental clarity? Let me tell you, it was like wiping a foggy window clean for the first time. I could think faster, remember details, and tackle complex problems without the overwhelming sense of mental fatigue that used to haunt me. For someone who lives and dies by their ability to perform, this was a game-changer.

**Then came the physical changes.**

I’d always struggled with weight, especially around my midsection. No matter how much I worked out or tried to eat clean, progress was always slow. But with this product, my metabolism felt like it shifted into high gear. Combined with my renewed energy, hitting the gym didn’t feel like a chore anymore. It felt like an opportunity to push myself further. Within weeks, I started noticing changes in my body. My clothes fit better, the scale started moving in the right direction, and my confidence skyrocketed.

But the best part wasn’t just what I saw in the mirror—it was how I felt inside. There’s a unique kind of happiness that comes from knowing you’re living up to your potential, and for the first time in years, I felt like I was finally back in control.

I know it sounds dramatic, but I can honestly say this product changed my life. It wasn’t some overnight miracle, but it was the missing piece of the puzzle I’d been searching for all along. The natural ingredients, carefully chosen for their ability to support cellular energy, metabolism, and overall health, delivered exactly what they promised—and more.

He depends on human beings telling fantastic tales of *Biblical-level* ;destruction and fury.  But ironically, he seems quite absent when we're looking, like some sort of Schrödinger paradox. This is indistinguishable from mythology and makes Allah seem impotent, silly, or non-existent.

He seems quite unable at really doing anything interesting outside of the laws of nature.

The religious scriptures have a completely different character of Allah, he's actively intervening in the physical world with people - a stark contrast from reality. Allah can't even nudge the coffee cup on my desk.  Allah can't even tell me he exists (in my inner voice), meanwhile, the insane asylum is replete with people having two-way conversations with God.

1i5ynua,https://i.redd.it/egitryr8a7ee1.jpeg,RESIDENT EVIL 9 - 🚨UPDATES,"Some information about the RE9 delay that you might want to know!

All of this information was provided by a source from Capcom USA Marketing over coffee today!

• Capcom was not happy with the marketing results for Village, several aspects are being reworked in the marketing for RE9 before an official and imminent announcement!

• The game is in an advanced stage of development (as I have said several times) but some gameplay aspects and items still need more polish, like the smoke grenade! I am not saying that it is the only factor responsible for the delay but my contact said that the RE Engine reached its maximum limit with RE9 and it will most likely be one of the last REs on this Engine!

• The REX Engine is not far from being presented to the public!

• RE9 will have a marketing that my contact describes as ""stratospheric"".

 • Leon is in a promotional image that my contact saw during a planning meeting, he describes his look as ""A mature Leon, but not too far from what RE4 Remake was!"" So here is the answer to the question you've been asking me for months, YES, RE9 will have Jill & Leon!

• He knows absolutely nothing about test sessions involving Leon, even though he is in the game! Marketing has only worked on test sessions involving Jill, at least in America!

• Blue Umbrella will be in the game, they are already developing the Synopsis and from the little material they have received to work with, the corporation is mentioned as something central to the game!

• He is confident in saying that things like moon cults, symbols and ritualistic things DO NOT seem to fit into the game! But he doesn't rule it out completely because when you work with marketing something so secretive your material is nebulous!

 MORE TESTING

• According to him, Capcom is planning 2 more testing sessions during next six months, he doesn't know if the same teams of testers will be called (I hope so, lol)

• RE9 is still a 2025 product for now... Apparently the game is still planned for the 2nd half of 2025 but whether that actually happens depends on all the issues that are hindering the reveal at the moment! In any case, his personal opinion is that he doesn't think this game will reach our homes this year!

• The game is being treated as ""The biggest survival horror entry in the franchise"". According to a preliminary synopsis!

• The name Apocalypse keeps coming up in marketing meetings so that shouldn't be changed!

 • The hospital should not be the only environment in the game (contrary to what I personally believed)

• The smoke grenade is not the only new thing in the game, we will also have sound grenades, which can be used to attract very aggressive creatures and avoid combat (I hope this can be used against those damn Hunters)

• Capcom will tease more things about RE until May.

","***Last minute!***

***--***

Hi PTG folks,

Already in Paris and no plans for tomorrow?

Well, weather should gift us a sunny day this Tuesday (before rain comes back the day after!)

What better conditions to wander around together on tiny semi-private tours?

(NB: I reduced the outdoor tours duration to fit the weather conditions, and of course the price accordingly as well)

* **Morning** (10am): Get off to a good start with a great coffee at the friendly marché d'Aligre, then elevate ourselves and see the city from above by walking up the Coulée Verte, Paris greener equivalent of NYC's High Line.
* **Lunch** (12.30pm): ""*To eat or not to eat in a typical French bistro""*, that is the question?
* **Afternoon** (3pm): Come back in the heart of the city to wander around the village-like Butte aux Cailles and its non-less surprising neighbors, steeped in the history of Paris... involving monkeys, water, Alsace and a balloon...
* **Late afternoon** (5.30pm): debrief during a well deserved drinking time in one of the local joints of Butte aux Cailles.

Get your tickets here either for the [morning tour](https://parisbsides.com/index.php/off-the-beaten-path-tours/41-the-coulee-verte-semi-private-tour-paris-high-line/), the [afternoon tour](https://parisbsides.com/index.php/off-the-beaten-path-tours/45-butte-aux-cailles-semi-private-tour) or both for a full journey across Paris!

Did you also had a similar experience after first date? ,"I think I am just getting inclined towards him more now. Earlier I used to not think about it so much and message him whenever it was convenient for me. But after yesterday's date night I have been somewhat feeling attached and inclined towards him, I have been waiting for his messages more, and I have been wanting to hear from him how did he like me ! He was too sweet, he bought me a huge flowers bouquet, a chocolate, a pine cone from his hometown, a gajra (a flower adornment which Indian woman wear to complement it with traditional attire on their hair or hairbun as it also decorates the hair, looks aesthetic af and smells like heaven, they are made with jasmine, tuberose or other such flowers), it was very thoughful of him, I mean no man I dated before has given me flowers, I even had to ask for flowers to one of them (you see, so pathetic!) And then I meet this man, who was so thoughful and kind towards me. Due to my bad experiences I didn't buy anything for him, but at the end I also gave him a chocolate, He didn't let me pay even when I insisted so so so much! I felt too awkward that I didn't bring anything for him, because I didn't know anything that how it might go. He said it's fine there is always next time. We went to a cafe suggested by me, which was inside a bookstore, and it was so aesthetic and warm. I ordered him coffee as he was confused. He also bought a book from that book store for me, there wasn't any discount and I prevented him from doing so still he bought it, it was Khalil Gibran's The Prophet, he insisted me to read it. He once or twice flirted with me playfully. He didn't specifically gave me compliments though. It went beyong my imagination. I was happy. and yes he also drove for 1 and half hrs to pick me up from my location then we went to a cafe, he drove again for 35 minutes and then he dropped me back to my place, and then he had to drive back to his home again for 1 hours. Omg it was so hectic for him, I apologised to him a lot for such pain, but he sweetly said that it's nothing, guys do more than these things for their girls. It's since then I am feeling inclined towards him, nobody in this eternity has treated me so kindly, I know I should not be in rush but I really want to know his feelings about me, also I am pretty anxious that what if everything is just a fleeting moment, what if everything goes wrong like before, what if he is just nice with everyone and I am not the only one.

1i5yix7,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1i5yix7/any_seasoned_flyers_out_there_1/,Any seasoned flyers out there? 1,"Hey everyone. I’m writing for some advice and honestly some reassurance. I bought the airplane wifi but it’s incredibly glitchy and this is the only site I’ve been able to access- what a waste of 10 bucks. Anyway, let me explain. My friend, Mindy, called me last week, asking me to fly to her small town on the west coast. I met Mindy when she and I were in school together in South Carolina- Go gamecocks! I’ve been meaning to plan a facetime or maybe even meet halfway with her at one point. But no way did I want to take such a long flight. Mindy knows I am terrified of flying. When she tearfully asked- practically begged- me to come help her put the pieces back together after her sudden broken engagement, my stomach dropped and my heart started beating fast. Reluctantly, and after many more indistinguishable heartfelt wails from Mindy, I agreed to fly out. Mindy had never had the best luck with guys but I really thought she had figured it out after meeting Jeff at a garage sale. They both went to buy the same lawn gnome at the same time. They ended up agreeing to split custody and the rest is history. As I booked my ticket, my palms already slick with apprehension, I wondered what went wrong. Did he cheat? He didn’t see the type. Cold feet? The guy is a city planner and no stranger to commitment, hence getting a girl’s number to maintain his lawn gnome.

Being the good friend I am, I locked in my flight- a straight shot at least- and started my typical response of anxiously ruminating on it. I’m not sure if anyone can relate, but I have a pretty intense fear of flying. I’m talking gripping the seat, praying to every god and devil you’ve ever heard of, and sweating more than you thought humanly possible. I’ve had to fly a handful of times- for a job interview, a wedding, and once for a dog’s birthday. I won’t lie- I had to borrow half of a buddy’s valium to get through that last one.

This morning- wow, was it really just this morning?- I checked in early and started my deep breathing exercises in the gate. I like to sit facing the plane. You know how they say never to turn your back on an enemy. I visualized a safe smooth flight as I sipped my overly expensive airport coffee. Decaff to compensate for the adrenaline. I sent Mindy a friendly text letting her know I would be there tonight, along with a hug emoji. She thumbs up the message. Surprisingly, she’s been radio silent about the whole thing. I guess she wants to wait and talk about it in person.

Just as I felt myself adjusting to being in the gate, an announcement blared over the speakers. “Attention travelers, Flight \*redacted\* is no longer boarding on schedule. Please see gate agent for more information”. At least, I think that’s what it said. I had my headphones in, listening to a meditation specifically for waiting for your flight.

Fast forward to this evening, my flight boarded just as the sun was setting. As I walked to my seat, I couldn’t help but think that was a bad sign. I anxiously looked for my seat number and found it- directly on top of the wings. After lots of anxious flights, I learned that you feel less turbulence if you sit there. I took my seat by the window and looked out at the wing, hoping no one would sit by me. Those hopes were dashed when a young guy with dark hair and over-the-ear headphones sat down in the aisle seat. He looked half asleep already and I wondered if he was also here early this morning. We exchanged polite nods as he set his carry-on bag on the floor in front of his seat. He put his laptop on the seat between us and told me he didn’t think we would have another passenger there. I sighed in relief. I’d love the extra elbow room and privacy.

I put my own headphones on and went back to my breathing. I couldn’t help but assess my surroundings, even though I don’t know shit about planes. My eyes were drawn to the duct tape on the wings and the fading paint, which (along with some well-placed bird poop) made the numbers 688 look more like 666. I rolled my eyes. Even I couldn’t go along with my own thoughts about how that must be a sign. I wiped my palms on my sweats- because for real, who is wearing jeans for a cross country flight?- and looked around at my fellow passengers. Lots of calm, disgruntled faces. An older couple sat a few rows up and a middle-aged couple with a baby behind them. I’m sure most folks wouldn’t like to see that, but I always feel a little safer with a baby on board. Like whatever cosmic force exists will let me survive this flight if there’s a little baby involved. I smiled when the baby looked at me and it gave me a gummy smile back. Cool- seems like the baby is on my plan for appeasing greater forces with its presence.

I noticed two flight attendants whispering to one another and grimaced. I read to practice looking at the flight crew for signs of distress and I already didn’t like this. The head flight attendant already gave me a smile that seemed to stretch way too far when she greeted me. I examined the two flight attendants’ posture- looking for signs of distress- before I realized I also don’t know shit about body language either. Wait a second, was that a bruise on her wrist? And a cut on the eye brow of the other Flight attendant? My thoughts raced with images of FAs being held hostage and forced to fly us somewhere or take us hostage. I glanced at my seatmate, he was scrolling reddit and chewing gum loudly. Across the aisle, an older man snored through the safety presentation. I swear, I ‘m envious of everyone who can sleep on a planet. No one seemed worried about the flight so far. I reminded myself that planes travel safely all the time and a lot of people bruise easily.

I took note of the inflatable vest near me and the exit row, while my seatmate pulled up his Netflix account on his laptop. I closed my eyes during take off and counted, trying desperately to not hyperfocus on the acceleration. Eventually, the seat belt light went off and I nervously undid mine. I could feel my face turning pale with anxiety and had some trouble controlling my breathing. I gestured to my seatmate to let me past and made my way to the bathroom. This is huge progress, by the way.  I splashed cold water on my face and used the naming things you can see as a grounding technique my therapist recommended. The mirror, the toilet, a little soap dispenser. I noticed a small scrap of paper tucked under the mirror. Curiosity and an intense desire for a distraction go the best of me and I worked it out from behind the mirror.

It was a faded newspaper article. The journal’s name sounded like gibberish and didn’t bring back any results when I looked it up and reverse image searched it. It had a picture of a plane, looking slightly ominous with a stormy background. Wait a second, the numbers on the wing were the same, 688. This was an article about this plane. It was really faded but I was able to make out a few lines. “Strange phenomenon” “rules must be followed” “grave consequences” “cannot be trusted”. My eyes grew wide. What the actual hell. I’ve been sweating in my seat and flinching at every bit of turbulence ever since. Google hasn’t helped at all. I’ve read over the paper repeatedly. I’m not sure what this means. Hell, I don’t even know if I count myself lucky or cursed to have found it.  Is this plane cursed? Is it haunted? What are the rules? I could really use some outside perspective. Are there any more seasoned travelers out there that can decipher this mess for me?",1,1737401022.0,nosleep,1,0.67,False

Cuvée casks are commonly referred to as STR casks 

Wine casks have been shaved, toasted, and re-charred

Staves are shaved 3-5mm and paired with longer toasting and charring times with lower temperatures

Each cuvée cask holds 59 gallons 

Ex-Kentucky bourbon casks are from Brown-Forman

Mashbill: 100% two-row spring barley for brewer’s pale malt

Length of fermentation: 72 hours 

Still type: Northern Fabricators of Elgin Scotland, a subsidiary of Forsyth

NCF

Lead Blender: Amanda Beckwith

Proof: 96

as of this moment… American Single Malt and American Straight Single Malt both show up as classification codes with TTB… and both are options for distilleries to check a box when filing for approval… codes 165 & 166z

Most of the reviews online seem to be from 2023 and 5.5 years in age.  This beauty packs an extra year. Simply put… This is a beautiful American single malt. I always know that I really like something when my first thought is which local friends I’m going to share it with. The mouthfeel is excellent… and it’s packed with character.

In 2024, I tried 3 others from Virginia. Blue Ridge Select, Gingerbread Stout Cask, and Bourbon County Brand Stout Cask.  I really enjoyed all of those, but I’ll take this one every day.

I really like this one and I’m teetering between rating it a 7 or 8… but I think I’m going with 7.

So, you're planning a trip to Italy – the land of pasta, pizza, and… tipping?  Navigating tipping customs in a foreign country can feel a bit daunting, but don't worry!  This guide will demystify Italian tipping etiquette, ensuring you leave a good impression without breaking the bank.

**The Basics: Is Tipping Mandatory in Italy?**

Unlike some countries where tipping is expected, tipping in Italy is more of a gesture of appreciation for good service.  It's not obligatory, but it's certainly appreciated!  Think of it as a ""thank you"" for a job well done, rather than a fixed cost.

**Who to Tip:**

* **Restaurant Servers:**  This is the most common scenario where tipping is customary.  Good service warrants a tip, while mediocre service may not require one.
* **Hotel Staff:**  Small tips are appreciated for porters (carrying luggage), housekeeping (a few euros left daily or at the end of your stay), and other helpful staff.
* **Taxi Drivers:** Rounding up the fare is usually sufficient, no need for large amounts.
* **Tour Guides:**  A tip is appreciated for a particularly engaging and informative tour.
* **Baristas:** Tipping isn't expected for a simple coffee but is appreciated for more elaborate drinks or if you're a regular customer.


**When to Tip:**

* **Restaurants:**  Tips are usually given directly to the server, or left on the table at the end of your meal.
* **Hotels:** Leave tips discreetly – on the nightstand or in a small envelope for housekeeping, or hand it directly to the porter.
* **Taxis:** Round up the fare, handing the driver the extra cash directly.
* **Tours:** Tip your guide at the end of the tour.


**How Much to Tip:**

There's no hard and fast rule, but here's a general guideline:

* **Restaurants:** 5-10% of the bill for good service.  You can round up the bill or leave a few euros if the bill is low.  In touristy areas, you might see slightly higher tips.
* **Hotels:**  A few euros per day for housekeeping (depending on the length of your stay and level of service).  For porters, €2-€5 per bag is a reasonable tip.
* **Taxi Drivers:** Rounding up the fare is usually sufficient. A euro or two more than the total fare is a nice gesture.
* **Tour Guides:**  €5-€10 per person is a common tip, depending on the length and quality of the tour.  For larger group tours, a slightly higher amount is appreciated.
* **Baristas:**  No tip needed for a simple coffee but round up the cost for a more complex order.

**Important Note:** Service charges are rarely included in bills, unlike some other countries.  Always check your bill before paying to avoid surprises.

**A Word of Caution:** Don't feel pressured to tip excessively.  A modest tip for good service is perfectly acceptable.

**In short:** Tipping in Italy is a flexible system, focused on rewarding excellent service. Use your judgment, be generous for good service, and relax – you’ll be fine! Enjoy your Italian adventure!

We’ve gotten pretty close and have been spending more time with each other and we talk a lot. Last week we went out for lunch together and I was under the impression that it was sort of a date. I never called it one and we planned it over text, but I still assumed that and it’s my bad for that. She didn’t think it was one. After that we planned to go out again next week. This weekend we ended up realizing that we had different understandings of what had happened and clarified our intentions with things and while she didn’t see our first time going out as a date, she still is interested in dating me, she just wants to take things slower. I was ok with that and we agreed that we would spend a little more time together before I would ask her out officially. 
My first question is me wondering if this situation seems bad or setup for failure. To me it seems good that we can talk openly about things like we did and come to a common understanding. We are compatible with each other and I really would like for things to work out with her. We are likely going to be going to college soon within 15 minutes of eachother so it could work long term.
Additionally, I want to know what I should do about a first date. I want it to be something sorta special cause she’s the type to appreciate that and we’ve already done what is basically a first date. Problem is we live sort of in the middle of nowhere, there’s not much to do other than just food cause other things like mini golf are closed for the winter. I thought maybe we could go out for brunch to a nice place. I like the idea of a coffee date but I suggested that for the last time we went out and she seemed opposed to the idea so maybe not. I can’t think of much else that we could do but I really want to be something special. 
Any advice not just with date ideas but also with the whole situation is appreciated. I’m horrified I have to ask for help on Reddit but I don’t have anyone else to ask. ",1,1737400598.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

I’m 30F and originally from Upstate New York, so I’m familiar with the weather (and ready for it!). I served 6 years in the Navy as a corpsman and just transitioned to civilian life. I haven’t traveled much during my service, but I did spend a few years in North Carolina and San Diego before moving here. I go to school online but am looking to go in person over the next few months once I get a routine going.

In my free time, I enjoy pottery, reading, live music, and decorating. I also like snowboarding—though I’m definitely not great at it, but I enjoy getting out there. Since October I’ve been attending OCIA and was planning to get baptized as Catholic on Easter, but not sure how that’s going to work seeing as I haven’t attended classes this month due to relocating. I’d describe myself as kind of boring, and honestly, I love that about myself.

I’m hoping to meet some new people to explore the city with, try out local spots, and just enjoy good company. If anyone’s up for grabbing coffee, bible study, hitting the slopes, or sharing music venue recommendations, PUH-LEEEEEEEZ feel free to reach out! :)

I didn’t tell him until the other night about all that’s going on and he’s trying to figure it out. This is long. I just need it out and I didn’t want anyone to be under the guise he isn’t trying.

I have severe PTSD and anxiety. I’ve been trying to live with it but I just moved out of my abusive parent’s house and went no contact. Living with my partner is amazing, our little home is wonderful— but my autistic BIL lives with us and I had no problem with that until he started doing a lot of things. I handled a lot at first, I have a ton of patience. He tried to rant to me about my partner, he made up lies and stuff I quickly dismissed and it made me excruciatingly uncomfortable. I wanted to tell him to stop, but I had read online it was autism and I just needed to deal with it, so despite my discomfort I did. Later I read I needed to set firm boundaries and I am seriously trying to, I just come from such an abusive household that if you didn’t just take the abuse and tried to set a boundary it was war and hell on earth. I started putting some space between us because he was hugging me too much and his ranting was exhausting me. Then, I got sick. I’ve been sick for a bit now and on this specific day, my partner was at work. My BIL came in and asked me to make him an omelette. I 110% did not feel like it but I sucked it up because he asked and did it. Mid cooking, he grabbed a bag with a cookie I had left in it. I made us all cookies a few days ago and it was fair but I just didn’t want my last one so I was giving it to my partner who loved them. My BIL for some reason said he’d throw it away and I directly, clearly, and explicitly asked him not to and said no don’t. But he told me it didn’t matter and did it anyway. I finished his food and went to my room alone because that upset me so bad. The next couple nights, he’s been so loud in his room I haven’t been able to sleep which has not helped with me being sick. One morning, he got up while we were still in bed trying to sleep, came in my room, and started laughing and talking loudly. I was getting overwhelmed and it took me forever to figure out what to do. I waited for him to leave and I just shut my door and collapsed, but I couldn’t sleep. The same day, I didn’t wanna be around him. I was really grumpy and upset and I didn’t wanna be short with him. I started playing a game to relax while he talked to my partner and he came up right next to me, in my ear, and started yelling about my game and I was getting more overwhelmed but I kept my patience still. Later that night, he had broke me. I was extremely anxious so I showered and we went to make food. Now, my BIL paces a lot. I have no problem, I actually pace too when I’m thinking, except he does it in our tiny living room/kitchen. His room is bigger than that space and when he’s pacing in the shared space, I get a debilitating anxiety. He seems to get upset at us like we’re in our way, including getting upset at my cat when he was pacing. Even if he paces into my room. So I curled up in a ball in the floor and just tried to not cry. My partner asked him 3 times to pace in his room which is much bigger than it living room/kitchen, and on the 3rd told him to, explaining it was causing me a lot of distress tonight. He got mad, told him something like it’s not his problem my family messed me up and left. (My partner did protect and defend me here) I was shaken up from there. The next day, I was still exhausted. I was woken up again by him but I pushed through. My partner went to work and I was alone here with him. The kitchen was quiet so I thought I could go make a cup of coffee. But he heard me come out and he followed me. This has been a pattern. He follows me out, especially when I’m alone, either to pace behind me (which again he was asked to stop with an explanation) or to rant about this. He started about how stupid, weak, and bratty, women are and more awful things. I knew I needed to be direct but he caught me so off guard all I could do was stare at the floor, clenching my hands and going over how I could say I’m uncomfortable and stop. This was triggering a lot of past trauma. I felt so trapped. I tried to walk away, but he would step in front of my path and I don’t know if it was intentional. Eventually, I just mumbled out “I’m gonna go work now” but he followed me to my bedroom, went in my room without me and continued. I waited until he was out and said I’m gonna work and shut the door, but then I just started sobbing. I did confide in my partner finally here and he came home and attempted to talk to my BIL cause I said I didn’t want a fight but he stormed off. I’ve been nervous since. Today, he woke me up again being loud and pacing in our living room/kitchen and he still is. Im trapped in my bedroom right now. I’m so hungry and thirsty I’m trying to suck it up but I don’t wanna go through the ranting again I can’t. I don’t know what to do. I can’t kick him out or something, I don’t want to see anything bad happen to him and idk if he would make it on his own. His parents kicked him out and my partner took him. He stopped showing up to his job to play video games and he eats all our food if we don’t label things. He spent all his money that was supposed to help with bills on video games. He has no care at all for any of us to even the smallest extent. He doesn’t care my partner is the reason he even has anywhere to sleep. I’m exhausted. I don’t want to talk to him today, I don’t want to be around him right now, but I don’t know what to do.",10,1737400508.0,TrueOffMyChest,10,0.86,False
1i5ya81,https://www.reddit.com/r/gravesdisease/comments/1i5ya81/are_these_symptoms_sufficient_enough_to_be/,Are these symptoms sufficient enough to be concerned?,"For context, I am a 20F in university who’s been active (lacrosse in high school, gymnastics in elementary/middle school, etc.) and eats pretty well compared to the standard American. I eat vegetables with almost every meal, try to keep the sugar/carbs to a minimum   (or at least make sure that they are coming from a real good source like fruit, honey, sourdough, dates, etc), and always make sure to eat a source of protein. I have never cut out food groups and will eat a burger when I want, but I’m general, I try to stay healthy and workout (lift 2 days a week, get my steps in everyday). 

I’ve always been on the thinner side but not to the point of extreme concern. My appetite has always been high too, but I always stayed pretty small. However, I have a ton of problems with bloating after meals, feeling hungry after having large portions, anxiety, constantly tired throughout the day, random feelings of passing out (I passed out in class my freshman year in front of everyone, almost in a coffee shop last year, and during an incredibly important meeting this past fall).

Sometimes I will stand up and feel super dizzy and light-headed even after I have taken my supplements (iron, zinc, probiotics). I am constantly hungry and eat huge portions, yet I have only lost weight (I’m talking two full servings of christmas dinner, nuts, other snacks, and then waking up in the middle of the night feeling hungry). I had a short period of VERY minor calorie deficit in my freshman year just to tone up, and I ended up going from 125 to 114 lbs within a month (I am 5’4). I’ve eaten normally since then and am down to 109 (and am shocked how I haven’t gained any weight from being home for the holidays). 

I am also incredibly irritable and have always had irregular periods (they are becoming more irregular). I will sometimes have the symptoms of PMS, but absolutely zero sign of blood. 
 

I drink a decent amount of caffeine everyday but have been trying to cut back. It doesn’t really do anything for my energy regardless, but I will drink an energy drink here and there if I have to study for awhile or get a good lift in. I’ve had to leave the gym multiple times from having either severe indigestion or fatigue. I also put in muscle pretty easily and can lift relatively heavy for my size (but I definitely have felt muscle weakness on dizzy days). 

Overall, I just don’t really know what I should do next, especially since doctors tend to resort to “drink more water” or “take iron” (which I have). I’m trying to go to medical school andI’m concerned about my tendency to pass out, feel fatigued, and needing to eat every couple hours to feel satiated.

PS. Haven’t gotten blood work done, was thinking about it but want to make sure these are valid reasons for thinking that Graves could be a cause. I am also worried that a diagnosis and medication will bring on another set of problems such as depressive thoughts or weight gain.

1i5y77x,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i5y77x,H: Trend List W: Feedback/You to have for reference,"Hello Xbox m76,

I want to start off this post by saying *nothing* in this market is ever static or 100%. Nothing can ever be valued 100% accurate, but we can see trends of trades completed and that's why I wanted to make this for myself as reference and share for anyone who may *need it.*

There's a fraction who value Leaders at 500 caps per and another fraction who value Leaders at 1000c per. Leaders aren't directly selling for caps, even posts offering 1750c per Leader have no replies. With that said, the cap conversion for items is lost a lot of times and many feel if they don't have any substantial amount of leaders, since not many posts ask for anything but leaders, they can't get a foot into the market.

Having cap values, along with other currency, helps put perspective on the true value (not just leaders) as Leaders may not always stay relevant. Bethesda could, at any moment, character lock bobbleheads or perhaps the new **Glowing Bobbleheads** ruin regular leaders. In any case, we should stay ahead of the curve and have cap values on items so that whatever the currency may change to, we still have a solid foundation for reference.

I'm in hopes this list will alleviate a lot of the pressure for newer traders and hopefully show avenues to take to start small and trade their way up. Fasnacht 2025 is right around the corner and will see a boom, as we do each year.

[LAGOM casa Price Update](https://www.option-o.com/news/2025/1/20/lagom-casa-price-adjustment-18th-feb-2025)

>Hi all,

>We have an important update regarding the LAGOM casa that we’d like to share. If you are interested in or are considering the Casa, this update may be of interest to you.

>Thanks to our early supporters and loyal users, the launch of the LAGOM casa has been incredibly well-received overall. Feedback has consistently exceeded expectations, with many describing it as delivering value far beyond its cost. Some have even compared it favorably to grinders priced several times higher - and we’re glad that has been noticed! While there may a couple minor issues early on - as is common with any new product - we worked swiftly to address them and we are thankful to our users for their patience and allowing us to resolve this for them.

>The LAGOM casa represents a significant investment of effort, technology, and expertise, all condensed into a compact grinder designed to deliver exceptional performance for coffee enthusiasts at home. Of course, that commitment also came with high manufacturing costs. However, we initially launched the Casa at a very competitive price, making a deliberate decision to prioritize accessibility.

>To ensure we can continue offering the LAGOM casa sustainably, we’ve had to make a difficult but important decision. **Starting** **February 18th, 2025**, the price of the LAGOM casa will increase slightly. The Casa with the 65CL burr set will see a price adjustment of $40, bringing it to **$526 + shipping**. Despite this adjustment, we firmly believe the Casa 65 remains one of the best values on the market, and we stand by it with confidence. Additionally, we will be discontinuing the Casa 48.

>This price adjustment will allow us to maintain the quality and innovation our customers expect while continuing to offer exceptional value and user experience.

>We deeply appreciate your ongoing support and trust - it means the world to us.

>Thank you for being a part of the LAGOM journey.

>Sincerely,

When I moved into my cozy cabin on the edge of town, all I wanted was peace, quiet, and space for my woodworking hobby. I’d found the perfect place: a little patch of heaven surrounded by trees, with a driveway that twisted away from the main road like a secret path. What I didn’t know was that this paradise came with a catch: my property technically fell within the jurisdiction of the Maple Acres HOA.

At first, it seemed harmless. The welcome letter in my mailbox was polite, if a little formal. But I should have known something was up when they listed “approved shades of beige” for exterior paint colors. I filed the letter away, figuring I’d never hear from them again. Oh, how wrong I was.

The trouble started three weeks after I moved in when I built my dream shed. I’d saved for years to have the perfect workspace, and I went all out: cedar siding, custom windows, and a shiny green roof. The day it was finished, I stood back to admire it—and that’s when *she* appeared.

Karen.

She pulled up in her spotless white SUV, wearing sunglasses so big they made her look like a bug. Karen was the HOA president, and she wasted no time introducing herself as the self-proclaimed sheriff of Maple Acres. She stepped out with a clipboard and what I can only describe as a plastic smile glued to her face.

“This won’t do,” she said, pointing her pen at my shed.

“Excuse me?” I replied.

She launched into a lecture about how my shed violated the HOA’s aesthetic guidelines. Apparently, sheds had to be “neutral-colored and not visible from the road.” When I explained that the shed was on my private property and well-hidden behind a line of trees, she huffed, adjusted her oversized sunglasses, and said, “Rules are rules.”

From then on, I was Public Enemy No. 1.

First, they hit me with fines. $50 for “unapproved construction.” $75 for “disrupting the visual harmony of the neighborhood.” $100 for “failure to submit architectural plans for approval.” I ignored them all. Then came the warnings: letters stamped with bold red “FINAL NOTICE” banners, threatening legal action if I didn’t dismantle my beloved shed.

One morning, I walked outside to find Karen and two other board members *measuring my shed.* They had a level, a tape measure, and a clipboard. I stood there, coffee in hand, watching them act like they were surveying the pyramids.

“What are you doing on my property?” I asked.

Karen didn’t even look up. “We’re documenting your violations.”

I smiled sweetly. “Cool. I’ll be documenting *your trespassing* when the cops get here.”

That got their attention. They scurried back to their SUV, muttering about how I was “hostile.”

**Final Straw**

Things escalated when I got a letter claiming I owed the HOA $10,000 in back dues and fines. $10,000! I laughed so hard I nearly fell off my porch swing. They had no authority to charge me anything close to that amount, but Karen was clearly trying to bully me into submission.

What they didn’t know was that I’d been keeping receipts—literal and figurative. I had photos, videos, and timestamps of every time they stepped onto my property without permission. I even had footage of Karen dumping a bag of leaves onto my driveway, presumably to frame me for “yard debris violations.”

It was time to fight back.

# Victory is Sweet

I hired a lawyer who specialized in HOA disputes. When Karen and her cronies realized I wasn’t backing down, they tried to settle. I refused. The matter went to small claims court, where I presented my mountain of evidence. The judge took one look at the case and ruled in my favor. The HOA was ordered to drop all fines, pay my legal fees, and issue a formal apology. Karen’s face turned the color of an overripe tomato.

But the best part? The judge declared that the HOA had overstepped its bounds and voided their claim over my property entirely. I was free!

# The Aftermath

Word spread quickly. Other neighbors who’d been quietly suffering under Karen’s reign started speaking up. Turns out, she’d been issuing bogus fines for years, pocketing the money for herself. The HOA held an emergency meeting, where Karen was unanimously voted out. She left town not long after, her pristine SUV loaded with boxes.

With Karen gone, the HOA collapsed. No one wanted to take her place, and honestly, no one missed it. The neighborhood became more relaxed. People painted their houses whatever colors they wanted. Someone even threw a block party, and yes, I brought a plate of cookies and a six-pack to share.

As for my shed? It still stands proudly, a symbol of freedom and a reminder to never let anyone tell you what shade of beige your life should be.

**TLDR:** Karen the HOA president tried to make me tear down my dream shed with bogus fines and threats. I took her to court, won big, and watched as the HOA crumbled under the weight of her nonsense. Now I live in peace, and my shed remains a monument to victory.",2,1737399790.0,JustNoHOA,1,1.0,False

**Start Q&A Portion**

* [Q&A: Lego stream, when?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eq0774ak4mw) - ANSWER: This is in reference to the [**Lego Constructor Build**](https://www.reddit.com/r/SatisfactoryGame/comments/1fj0e7s/satisfactory_10_release_livestream_09102024/) *(scroll down to Lego Constructor Portion)* that was attempted during the Version 1.0 Release Livestream on September 10, 2024. They were **not able to finish it** and stated they planned to do another livestream.

   * Perhaps next week they might make this happen. Also they might show the results of the FICSMAS Workshop Competition next week also. Next weeks stream may start earlier and last longer.

   * [Likely Snutt's last stream next week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eq0774ak4mw&t=194s) - ANSWER: Snutt mentioned that next weeks Livestream will most likely be his least due to [his stepping down as a Coffee Stain Studios Community Manager](https://www.reddit.com/r/SatisfactoryGame/comments/1hae7n1/im_stepping_down_as_a_community_manager/) (Reddit Post / Video).

   * [Q&A: What's going on Snutt's leaving cake?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eq0774ak4mw&t=255s) - ANSWER: Several comments but no real answer.

* [Q&A: Trains seem buggy since Update 8, were they overlooked for 1.0?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lc8chAMuGs8) - ANSWER: Trains were extensively overhauled in Version 1.0. If you are having issues then that is best posted on the [Satisfactory Q&A Website](https://questions.satisfactorygame.com/search?sort=1) where the Devs will see it. Provide as much detail as possible since you might be experiencing an ""edge case"" that is not common for everyone.

   * 🚩 **Mod Shoutout:** Snutt gives a shoutout to the [Train Interiors Game Mod](https://ficsit.app/mod/TrainInteriors) that allows you to use 1st Person View in Trains which might inspire the Devs to make it a Vanilla Feature *perhaps / maybe*.

* [Q&A: First-person Train, when?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBX84YNTtcI) - ANSWER: Snutt mentions that first person trains was not considered that big of a deal, but after viewing the Train Interiors Game Mod Snutt is on board (pun intended) with having first person trains. While Snutt is for first person trains, he won't be presenting the idea to the Dev Team given he will be leaving soon.

   * ★ Snutt mentioned he will be available for two more Livestreams, so in late January 2025 early February 2025 he will be departing Coffee Stain Studios.

* [Q&A: When will new Drone Ports show Fuel costs again?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fo2eHARNt8) - ANSWER: While no direct answer to question, Snutt did emphisize that every post and comment on the Q&A Website is seen, but they struggle to effectively communicate when or if a ""fix"" *(if possible)* will be released.

* [Q&A: Do you think the Story is lacking?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0eDpNOm4v4) - ANSWER: The ""Story"" or ""Narrative"" was never intended to be a main focus, but is provided more as a open-ended backdrop to provide Pioneers some reason they are on the Planet called MASSAGE-2(A-B)b in the binary star system of Akycha. The Satisfactory Community has pieced together some good theories as to what the Story"" or ""Narrative"" means, *but CSS will neither confirm or deny any of those theories.*

* [Q&A: Are you still going to push a Controller beta for PC before Console Release?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJWDFu6EU2w) - ANSWER: That is still the ""plan"" but it remains to be seen of it will happen. They might do the Controller Beta for PC at same time as the Console Release, since they want to become Steam Deck Verified, but it involves a lot of work. *More on this for sure at a later date.*

* [Q&A: Crossplay with Consoles?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwJcQfpc5CQ) - ANSWER: Both Version 1.1 Release and Console Release are TWO different things. While crossplay between Playstation and Xbox will be possible, they have not fully decided if they will have crossplay between Consoles and PC, given doing so will cause delays in publishing game Patches.

* [Q&A: Will Hannah still be around for 1.1?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8ICGSQ1fX0) - ANSWER: CSS Level Designer Hannah Beuger, who also leads the World Design Team, will still be around for Version 1.1, but they are not planning on changing the World Map other then to push bug fixes.

* [Q&A: Is Rain still on the menu & will it create puddles?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSMk4RroUSc) - ANSWER: Yes, they are working on re-introducing rain but *no date for release given.* As for ""puddles"" that is unclear, but rain will make surfaces ""wet"" and ""reflective"".

* [Q&A: Did you know the new speedrun for the game is 10 hours, 25 minutes, and 19 seconds?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40YSoWdZ_Bc) - ANSWER: Snutt did know this as he is an avid member of the [Satisfactory Speedrun Community](https://www.speedrun.com/satisfactory). There was more discussion which you can view if interested.

Keep in mind, I wasn’t having a good day as I haven’t been feeling too well. 

But, long story short, I visited my girlfriend after not seeing each other for a week. When I arrived I wasn’t feeling too well and was short with her. (I know and understand how I this made her upset) after settling down I began to give her more love / hugs/kisses and relaxed for a bit. After a while, I went and got on my xbox and played some games for 30 minutes while she was busy doing something. She cried and told me how I wasn’t excited to see her and how I was so unappreciative. So I apologized and we both sat down and watched some TV and we both brushed it off. So next I put my feet up on the coffee table and she gets aggressive and chews me out how dirty it is to put my feet on the table. I should’ve known better, but I apologized, again and put my feet down. Yet, her dog jumped on the table 5 minutes after this and drank water out of a glass we had there and she did absolutely nothing about that. 

Onto the next morning, she sends me a text stating how I was so unappreciative towards her, had bad energy, and how I should work on this. Additionally, she said I should think of ways how I should make up for my behavior and buy her flowers 

I would like some guidance/help because I feel like I am always in blame or doing something constantly wrong no matter what. I am unsure if she is being controlling or jealous of what I do but this is getting old. We’ve been together for almost 3 years and I’ve felt like I’m always in the wrong, no matter what happens.",2,1737399609.0,AskMenAdvice,16,0.75,False

Then, kept running into him at all the local coffee shops around town that it was getting comical. Started talking more cause we both work in a hosptial, but different levels/careers. 

Didnt know his name for months but we would shoot the shit and hug goodbye. All that jazz

Finally figured out his name and we exchanged numbers to get coffee. No this isnt romantic, im not into men and I have a partner. He is also not into dating so thankfully i dont have to worry about that

We get coffee every now and then and talk about our jobs, violin, general adult life topics and our sporatic landlord

I know what I'm looking for has 100s of variables but can someone or does someone know what the average private coffee shop makes (revenue/profit)?

Let's make some assumptions:  it's in a relatively populated and affluent area.  However the specific location is not in a ""town"".  It's in a strip mall type spot. With a restaurant, chiropractor, jiu jitsu school, moving in to the space as well.  The space was just bought and is being renovated.  Updated and modernized.  Huge parking lot.  Not in a town as stated.   The town is ""growing"".  You have to pass this shopping area on your way to the ""town"" or ""main street'

An acquaintance who is on his 3rd coffee shop is willing to help and says it'll be a goldmine.  The acquaintance while trustworthy and a honest and assertive businessman also can be a bit of a blow hard.  And we haven't asked him to show us his ""books"" but he is claiming he kills it at his (I've visited one of his on a main street full of bars and restaurants and yes...it's insane, but that is ideal location) locations.  He has put 2 other coffee shops out of business on the same main street his is on.  Other owners come in to video his set up.

Think cozy lighting, rugs, pastries, gelato, crepes, couches, live music sometimes.  Open late. Etc.  That his model and the vision we have.  It's more about the experience than the actual coffee.  Door dash etc would be in the equation too.  Our location is near an army base, private airport, and Amazon offices, not to mention a huge townhouse development directly across the street.

I'm a pessimist and realist.  He says revenue of 400k from June to October.  He also claims profit (after absolutely everything) of about 25k a month easy. (After he looked at my place)

Sorry...but I call BS.  The space is only about 950 square feet (my space not his locations).

I'm trying to talk to other old school coffee shop owners to get more input.  Can it be good? Sure.  If the model works, would i open more?  Sure.  But I can't get real numbers to even make an informed and educated decision.

Anyone?  Give it to me hard and straight.  I'm fighting with my partner because he is Gung ho and everything is rainbows and sunshine to him.  Using best case numbers.  I'm the opposite and want to use worst case or realistic case numbers.

Not really sure how to word this but see how it goes. Interesting to know people’s thoughts. 

Anyway, there’s this girl that I like which I haven’t known for too long. We work in the same profession but different places. I first met her at kind of a network meeting (both our places of work fall under the same trust) didn’t really talk to her at all but did communicate briefly through email. 

Last week as part of a wider network meeting she was there (I wasn’t aware she was gonna be there) there were like 4 different locations you could be at. Anyway coincidentally I ended up sitting next to her for this thing, ended up talking to her for the 2 and a half hours mainly about work. Towards the end I asked her if she wanted to grab a coffee, she initially said no. A few minutes later she turns around and changes her mind. We leave this thing, she mentions that she only has 20 minutes before her bus. We grab a coffee and were there longer than 20 minutes probably around 40 ish. It was genuinely one of the best conversations I’ve had in a long time. I ended up asking for number which she said she had recently changed it and couldn’t remember it off the top of her head. But then she gave me her phone to put my number in (didn’t ask her to do that). 

But she never texted me… I also never asked her too (I should’ve have). Quite disappointed by that because I could tell we were quite similar and just how we got on. 

I emailed her the next morning which she mentioned she totally forgot (Not sure if it was genuine) but even replies to that were vague. I will add that she seems very work driven and professional in that sense. 

We have another network meeting in just over a week - I don’t know if she is gonna be there. I’m hoping to just be straight up with her and tell her that I like her? (That’s worded poorly but too that affect). But if she isn’t then what can I do? There’s a chance that I wouldn’t see her again and if I do it won’t be for a while. 

For context, a couple of my friends who are female can’t work this out. One thinks she’s not interested and another thinks that she’s just oblivious and doesn’t realise I’m trying to get to know her. My gut tells me she’s not interested but I don’t know that was the first time I’ve properly spoken to her.  ",0,1737399511.0,dating_advice,1,0.5,False

I hope your week is starting off well. I’m interested in chatting with someone like-minded to see if there’s the potential for a romantic relationship. I’m truly looking to get to know someone, and I’m not in any rush for anything romantic to happen or any labels to be applied. While I don’t “need” a partner, I’d still like to find one, and I’m interested in taking my time and proceeding with intention. 

Here’s what I’m looking for: 

- Someone around my age (maybe 35-50).
- Someone in my general location (NC, or at least the East Coast).
- Someone who considers open-mindedness to be important. Someone who values equality for ALL people. Someone who looks at the current state of the world and sees ways to improve conditions for those who have been marginalized and oppressed. Someone who wants to use their voice to make this world happier, fairer, and more equal.
- Someone who’s passionate about things, whatever they may be.
- Someone who appreciates a good work/life balance.
- Someone who doesn’t always subscribe to a black-and-white view of the world, and who enjoys exploring things that are unique or nuanced.
- Someone who knows what they want and values connection, conversation, creativity, communication, and compassion. Someone who respects boundaries and is interested in an equal partnership. Someone who values working things out, even when that involves compromise.
- Someone who wants a monogamous relationship. I’m single and seeking someone who is also single. 
- Someone who is genuine in their intentions, and values consistency, openness, kindness, and honesty.
- Someone who’s looking for a partner to add depth and meaning to their life, rather than the romantic notion of a partner “completing” you. I think that’s a lovely idea in theory, but I’ve found that it’s unfair to apply those expectations to people in practice. I believe that we’re all responsible for our own happiness first and foremost.
- Someone who wants not only a partner, but a best friend; someone to enjoy life and all its ups and downs with. Someone who’s happy to do things together, but who’s also content to enjoy activities and hobbies separate from their partner.
- Someone who’s looking to proceed as friends first, without any immediate expectations surrounding intimacy. Don’t get me wrong, I love intimacy, and I’d like to find a partner who values spontaneity, passion, and variation! I just won’t be proceeding with that until both parties agree that there’s a solid foundation. 

Here are some things I enjoy, so you can get a sense of whether we may be like-minded:

- Road trips and travel, whether big or small, spontaneous or planned. 
- Learning new things and exploring new places and ideas.
- Reading, writing, music, art, and other creative pursuits. Curiosity in general. 
- Spending time with friends and family. 
- Laughter, humor, joyfulness, and comedy. I tend to have a sharp, dry, and even dark sense of humor, though I appreciate all sorts of humor. Laughter is healing.
- Cooking, baking, and going out to new restaurants, bars, coffee shops, etc. Culinary pursuits in general. 
- Hiking and exploring the outdoors when the weather permits. 
- Staying busy and active overall, without forgetting the adage that it’s important to stop and smell the roses. I enjoy little things: a cloudless day, making a stranger smile, discovering a new word or fact, and so on.
- The art of conversation; just sitting with enjoyable company and chatting about innumerable things, whether the topics are serious, silly, or anything in between. 

If this sounds like you, awesome! I love meeting new people. If this doesn’t quite sound like you, that’s okay, too! We’re all unique, and I wish you luck and contentment.

Well, whew! Thank you for reading my novel. I can’t believe you made it this far. I look forward to hearing from you and having some lovely chats with you!",3,1737399383.0,R4R30Plus,1,1.0,False

Plus we breastfeed exclusively and cosleeping has really helped with that. But I used to be super against it mostly because I am such a shitty sleeper as it is, I even have a hard time sharing the bed with my husband if he snores like at all. I’m a light sleeper and also it takes me for freaking EVER to fall asleep most nights even if I am really tired. And it feels like it takes me a long time to fall asleep even after the constant wake ups from baby. I wake up all night long, or at least it feels that way?! Every time he fusses. Every time he latches. Which is multiple times a night. I don’t even know how many but it’s a lot. 
It FEELS like I’m not getting much sleep at night, and yet…somehow I still have dreams?! Like last night I had a dream I was roaming around my small town’s shopping mall (it is such a sad pathetic mall I barely even call it that) but in the dream it was getting a bunch of new stores and was getting revitalized. Haha. But I honestly don’t know when I could have been asleep enough to even dream?!  Cause it felt like I was up a lot of the night. And yet once morning comes and we’re both up, and I’ve had a coffee…I feel fine?? Like I even had a decent sleep. So weird. 
It feels as though I have not had a deep sleep at all since he was born. And yet, I dream and my body copes. Copes better than if I were to fully get up and tend to baby in a crib. It’s so bizarre.

1i5xjib,https://www.reddit.com/r/FellowProducts/comments/1i5xjib/devilish_immersion_hack_for_aiden/,Devilish Immersion Hack for Aiden,"This is silly. Let's just get that right out of the way. The Aiden works very well without any such tomfoolery. *And yet*. 

I've been enjoying batch brews and larger single serve brews, but my smaller servings (10-20g coffee dose) haven't been great. As someone who enjoys forgiving immersion/percolation combos like Clever Dripper / Hario Switch / AeroPress, I started to wonder ...

There are recipes that use higher temp percolation followed by a slow & low immersion phase to extract more body and sweetness without astringency or other negative notes from the tail end of a brew. [Tetsu Kasuya's Devil's Recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC8K40kZ_6E) for Switch and [Berg Wu's Sauna Method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT_XX138nRs) for Clever come to mind. They work nicely but are a bit fussy for pourover since they use 2-3 different water temperatures.

Multiple water temperatures you say? Hello Aiden. 

But what about the **immersion** part? Well, if you open Aiden's lid and release the single serve basket latch right after a pulse finishes, you can do immersion for as long as you want—just close the lid when you want to drain the basket. You can even swirl or agitate (flat bed!). I imagine someone has done this before but can't find a similar approach online.

I've just started to play around with this hack and here's a preliminary brew profile that combines a lower temp Samo Bloom (because why not go buck wild with temps) with the Devil's Recipe (I also adapted Sauna method and I think Devil's works a bit better). Just lift the lid and pop the latch on the basket right as the 2nd pulse finishes to stop flow and switch to immersion mode! 

If the grounds look uneven you can stir or gently swirl the basket in the brewer. Wait 45 seconds or so; after the initial protest beep there will be a reminder beep after about that much time which is a handy prompt to close the lid and finish the brew.

**Devilish Immersion Hack** brew profile [https://brew.link/p/oWy9](https://brew.link/p/oWy9) :

1. 1:14 ratio, I get nice results with 300mL water. I'm grinding medium-fine at a 4 on Ode gen 2 but that's an area to play with.
2. 1:2 Bloom ratio, 30 second, 80C lower temp bloom for delicate aromatics.
3. 2 Pulses, 20s pause, Pulse 1 99C (ends up 90-92 in the basket after that bloom), Pulse 2 at 70C. 
4. Lift lid/pop basket latch to stop flow \*right as the 2nd pulse stops\*, wait about 45-60 seconds for the reminder beep, close the lid. Optional gentle basket swirl in the brewer during the immersion. 

The results for me are nice - all the flavors/aromas with sweet body, and it's closer to optimal drinking temp when it's done. But I'm not a super-taster, so I'm curious if anyone else likes the results or wants to improve the recipe. Grind size, bloom and first  pulse temp, length of cooler immersion all seem like promising variables. Thanks!

1i5xhl4,https://www.reddit.com/r/poetasters/comments/1i5xhl4/like_honey/,Like Honey,"Believe yourself when I tell you

It's slow like honey

Your memory will fix itself something liberal

All that sugar isn't natural but it tastes like I always remembered it 

Oatmeal and berries with a swirl of peanut butter that tastes like dessert for breakfast

Once when I was a child I ate a worm baked in summer sun

It tasted like shit

But I don't remember the taste of it

I remember the movements 

The sun hitting my skin, my hands warm preparing themselves to peal thin

My fingers like parchment paper and my throat like a desert 

I remember the work of bringing a gulp down and my eyes gingerly closing

But the taste isn't part of it

And that's the only thing that I remember when I think about it

I did it to impress you, an act of courage or maybe servitude

I talked to you once in class and you didn't remember until I mentioned it

A thousand years later when we first kissed

You moved your hair like we were underwater

You guided my fingertips to your shoulders under streetlights 

The skin on your cheek reflected the night like freckles made of stardust

And it tasted like coffee and it still does 

It's slow like honey

I asked if you remembered it one day

Of course you did, but I wonder if in your memory of it, the snow falls and melts on our faces

The sun sets west out the window between the leaves and I watch it above the book I'm reading as a child I don't know what I hated so much about this

It might’ve been the assignment, maybe the choice I didn't have in it, I would get distracted so easily, I remember counting the letters and listening to the music instead

I think it was watching you read that made me try it again a thousand years later

It was Lord of the Flies on a plane. I finished it the day I came home.

A few years before my uncle left and decided he wouldn't come back

I remember it from a few conversations but never saw it

The part where he left and appeared as a ghost in family portraits

A head full of nest and I'm told that he didn't stand a chance

I always remembered a man who would prove that he was one with a flared chest and deep breath

He got into bar fights, yelled at the television, and played war in his mind

He’d give gift cards at Christmas then pour himself drinks as his face slowly flushes 

He’d cry to himself when he was alone 

He took me to a park once

He forgot me there and I swung into the clouds like an airplane over and over

He fought my dog

In the middle of the day as the sun bathed the countertops and shadowed the chaos 

I stood like a shadow before the gate and watched the blood pool from his wrist and forearm onto the tile and in the cracks forever

I remember him picking me up from school until he didn't in the winter because of the ice

I remember he cared so much for us that he’d kill anyone who stood to take it

He has a daughter now but we dont see her

He adored her like every decision he made was hers

She has his eyes, blue and white like a stretched ocean under a summer sky

He loved us and I think he still does

It's slow like honey

Every waking memory trickles down and only parts make it to the mouth

I feel too old now to be worrying about how I remember a memory

The glint blinds me so I look into the shade hoping to find a reprieve in the bushes

The book closed and I admired the white and yellow ring at my knees

My aunt killed herself with a shotgun in the spring 

She would post sunsets with no caption

Her artwork was pretty and colorful with space cadets and long-haired women covered by branches and solar winds

Nobody cared to see it but they claimed their reasons

This was a different woman than the one I knew

Her hair spray would stick to my neck when she’d hug me

That day she left I smelled the perfume she wore creeping in from an open window

I stood tall and weak for a moment in the kitchen watching as birds fluttered from the feeder

I hadn't seen her in some time, but I heard a lot of stories about her

She could not help herself and what I remember was only a shell

She worked in the hospital

She had demons with voices that followed her

She accused the doctors

I don't know what she believed in but whatever it was I hope she's comfortable 

I don't pray but I think about her all the same

She was always sweet to me, she talked to me like a person and not a child

We didn't hold a funeral for her, I would’ve made it if we did

For me, I dont want one either

Give me to science or throw me to the vultures

I hope she had the same sentiment 

She adored my brother

I tilt my drink back and forth so that the ice cubes clink like a boxing ring

An impressionist painting of curiosity

He didn't speak but did so eloquently. He was saying things we just didn't hear them.

His hair cowlicked like mine

My hair is long now and its waves and curls become light in the summers

I remember those women who would come by for speech and therapy

They talked to you carefully as I watched on the carpet 

You flew through the cognitive sessions like practice

I remember the expressions on all of their faces

We read books and slept in the same bed, watched movies and I knew you understood everything

We walked the yard and played ball. I never underestimated you. 

You were four when they found you unresponsive in bed 

I looked but I didn't want to

That night you found me in a dream and we watched that morning unfold from the periphery, holding hands and listening to the clouds

I felt everything from the breeze to the sun, my mother's arms around the boy on the couch watching cartoons, but I wasn't sad, you told me that everything was in its right place

I was told you were in purgatory, but I knew better than to believe what they said 

If there was a God he would’ve had you at his hip 

We carried that stone of yours with Cars and John Deer all the way north

I still watch it close when I’m home 

I sip my drink looking over the water that reflects the deflecting red in the sun's disappearance

Slow like honey

I swallow and brace for the impact of everything

I don't know of all these remembrances what I'll all remember in the morning

I look behind me and see you resting your eyes on the sofa under arching orange skies

The first time I saw you sleeping I cried 

Because I’d never seen such a beautiful thing 

You slipped off into your dreams like a thief of masculinity, quick and unapologetic

Under the TV light and arm on my right, you swallowed up my pride for me

I remember such things as dessert because the longer they bake they burn 

It’s slow like honey

And if I remember enough they’ll taste like my pancakes with berries and peanut butter in a swirl

I watch as your eyes flicker under the comfort of nature on a television

I remember a fortune.

-shape into long oval bulka banneton sprinkled with rice flour 
-proof 90 minutes at room temperature then but banneton in freezer for 20 min

-score and place in cold Emile Henry Italian loaf baker and put into cold oven 
-bake at 475F for 55 min covered
-remove loaf and bake an additional 15 min at 400F  till brown and internal temp 205+

Notes - 

I did no additional stretch and folds after the envelope folds to incorporate the nuts.  I didn't want the nuts to tear the gluten.  Then again I usually only do a S&F at 30 min and then S&F / coil folds at 60min and then let nature do the work. 

I've been baking from a cold oven and a non-preheated vessel for the last 4 or 5 breads.  I like the oven spring, thinner but crispy crust, as well as the  safety and time concerns. 

I've been using a stiff-ish starter at 80% hydration feeding the scrapings with 75g of KABF with 10% rye and 50g water.  I find it fast and easy to mix, handle, and incorporate and is maybe a touch less sour than it was at 100%. This formula was based on a Daniel Leader article from Bread Alone. 

I've also been doing a room temperature proof instead my traditional cold proof fairly often depending on timing.  I'd rather bake at night and have the bread cooled for breakfast.  Also some of my clan prefer a less sour loaf.  

I just keep trying to make good bread while keeping things simpler, with less to wash and clean up, less interruptions, less handwashing etc. 

I usually wrap my leftover breads in bee cloth and whatever isn't eaten (or given away) in 3 days gets sliced and frozen and some of the smaller slices often get made into salad croutons.

Coffee name: Lobo

Growing altitude: 1000m

Origin: Brazil, Sul de Minas, Fazenda de lobo

Variety: Topázio

Processing: Anaerobic Natural

Flavour notes according to the roastery: Honey, golden kiwi, dark chocolate

Roasted: 19.12.2024


Ground with: Kingrinder K6

Brewed with: Plastic v60, one cup, Hario filter, Hoffmann recipe, so 50ml bloom until 0:45, then infuse 50ml. From 1:10 another 50ml, wait until 1:30 and repeat until the end. Swirl only at the end


In: 16

Out: 250

sec: 2:45

Temp: 95


Taste and experience:

The beans are slightly darker than expected. For me, this is also reflected a little in the aroma, which quickly becomes a little too bitter with Lobo. Overall, I found it quite difficult to brew it properly. For me, it could have been a little lighter. However, when brewed successfully, it tastes good - although the special note is somewhat lacking. You encounter sweetness and chocolate, accompanied by a clear and tangy fruit. For me, this tends towards a sweet citrus fruit. Unfortunately, I can't compare it to an actual golden kiwi.

But what if the key to success lies in the smallest actions we take daily? Enter micro habits—tiny, manageable behaviors that, over time, can lead to transformative results.

What Are Micro Habits?

Micro habits are small, simple actions that take only a few seconds or minutes to complete. Unlike ambitious goals that may feel overwhelming, micro habits are easy to sustain. For example:
	•	Instead of committing to a 60-minute workout, start with one push-up a day.
	•	Want to read more? Commit to one paragraph per day.

Why Do They Work?

Micro habits leverage two key principles:
	1.	Consistency Over Intensity: Repeated small actions compound over time.
	2.	Low Resistance: Since micro habits require minimal effort, it’s easier to build momentum.

Examples of Micro Habits That Transform Lives
	•	Health: Drink a glass of water first thing in the morning.
	•	Productivity: Write down three key tasks for the day.
	•	Mental Wellness: Practice gratitude by listing one thing you’re thankful for.

How to Start Your Own Micro Habit
	1.	Choose a Tiny Action: Pick something so easy you can’t fail.
	2.	Anchor It to an Existing Routine: For example, do it after brushing your teeth or while waiting for coffee to brew.
	3.	Celebrate Small Wins: Acknowledge your effort to reinforce the habit.

By starting small and staying consistent, you can achieve remarkable results over time. Remember, it’s not the size of the change that matters—it’s the commitment to keep moving forward.

I’m losing my mind with my 15 month old and 3 month old. I feel like I can barely handle anything as I am trying to do everything.

My husband is here and actively parenting, but he has things he needs to focus on and I need to give him time to do those things (these are things that help us, our families, plus his dad just passed away and he is executor of the will so I need to be functioning with the kids on my own). 

Goals with the schedule: 
1. I want to really try to enjoy some time to have a coffee and make breakfast while taking care of the kiddos in the morning
2. I want to try to get one round of dishes put away and dishwasher loaded
3. Keep laundry moving and at some point in the day actually fold and put laundry away
4. Take dogs and kids for one nice long walk.
5. Toddler naps from 1-3 PM
6. Would like to get out of the house once a day whether to a store or park or children’s museum. 
7. Can we maybe fit time for me to make it to the gym everyday and put the kids in childcare there?!
8. The kids wake up around 7:30 AM and go to sleep at 8:30 PM. (3 month old definitely not sleeping through the night)
9. Dinner and bed time routine starts at 5:30 (dinner, dog walk, bath time, stories, then bed)
10. Then there is the general tidy up of the house!
11. Projects?! Like getting rid of excess toys and reorganizing the storage closet :/
12. Did I mention I have a sleep disorder and need to nap as well which I do with the infant while toddler naps.

[Lance’s video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_U8nwO4cy0) last year sent me down a rabbit hole. I loved the espresso shots I pulled when slow feeding by hand, but I hit three major roadblocks...

1. **Time-Consuming**: Doing it by hand was tedious and impractical for more than one drink.
2. **Inconsistent Feed Rate**: My manual control introduced another variable, making it hard to replicate results.
3. **Grind Size Confusion**: The more uniform grinds required finer settings. Hosting friends meant juggling two grind sizes per coffee variety—slow feeding vs. regular.

Because I need a project at all times, and thrive on sleep deprivation I started building an automated slow feeder. The goal was to eliminate variables by allowing precise feed rate adjustments, and to save time, the outcome... living in a constant state of over caffeination. I just dump my dose in and let the feeder run (about 30 seconds at my preferred RPM), and use the time to prep milk and other steps.

Initially I was annoyed because slow feeding was worth the hassle but a massive inconvenience. Automation has made it an enjoyable addition, it took a little routine adjustment, but now it feels seamless.

What’s your take on slow feeding? Is it a hassle, a fun experiment, or something worth automating?

Im thinking about doing an semi extreme version of calorie cycling. Mon - Sat its not too bad for me to stay at my limit of 1,500 cal, i usually am able to keep it around 1,000 Mon-Sat, but Sundays is when i really struggle bc thats the day im home alone all day & my girl comes home with delicious smelling food.
My TDEE was about 2500cal & I want to loose weight fast so I decided a 1000cal deficit.

My typical diet is...
Breakfast at 6am: 2 Large Bananas equals about 200 cal & 12 fl oz of International Delight Zero Sugar Mocha Iced Coffee, about 90cal = 300cal

Im out the house for work from 7am to around 4pm

Dinner at 5pm: About 150g of air fried chicken breast equals about 250 cal & about 275g of air fried diced potatos around 200cal = 450cal. If i have any cravings, I'll drink a few diet sodas. Round up to 800cal total for the day

1500 × 7 = 10,500, typical 1500 a day
800 × 6 = 4,800, Mon-Sat

That means i have about 5,000cal to absolutely pig out on Sunday & stay in a deficit. I know its not the healthiest thing in the world but i think it might be whats best for me long term

I am in my 30s, and overall have been pretty anxiety free. When I was a kid, I would always be afraid of people dying, me dying, people leaving and not coming back, etc. This fear has come and went throughout most my life, resulting in pretty significant distress and maybe a mini panic attack every couple years. I do remember several times around the age of 10-14 where I would go outside because I felt like I couldn't breathe and would check to see if my fingernails were turning blue. Now that I am typing this out, I suppose I have never been anxiety free lol. Wow.

Anyway, at 28 I had a full blown panic attack when I found out I had fatty liver disease. This heightened state of anxiety lasted two days and my face had this crazy tingling sensation on one side that eventually convinced me to go to the ER, thinking I was having a stroke or something. Of course, everything was fine. Ever since that big panic attack I have been dealing with almost daily anxiety. Occasionally I would go weeks or months feeling pretty good. Other times, I would spend days feeling like I was on the brink of a panic attack.

A month ago, I had another panic attack after seeing a patient with mouth cancer. Due to ear and mouth pain I had been having, I was convinced I had mouth cancer. I was puking, crying, having diarrhea. My face began to tingle again, I felt disease, short of breath, and like my throat was closing. I left work to go to a walk in to get it checked out and the issue was that I had fluid behind my ear. Over the next 4 weeks I continued to go in and out of crying and panicking fits thinking there was something wrong. The tingling on my face persisted, and by that time I was convinced I had MS or a brain tumor or aneurysm. I was afraid to go to sleep or walk alone thinking I could collapse at any second.

After my first panic attack I went to a place that taught about meditation and really got into it. It was the only thing that helped in addition to some of the mantras I would repeat to myself. Ever since these have helped me, but they only bring me temporary relief in the moment. I knew I could no longer live like this.

I scheduled an appointment with a psychiatrist and she was really great. I couldn't have been luckier. I was started on lexapro and have been taking it for 4 days. I know most say it can take weeks to feel a difference, but I swear by the 2nd day I have noticed a change. One of the biggest being my mind is not CONSTANTLY active. I don't think of or plan conversations before they happen. I am not thinking of my future 4 decades in advance. I do not think of and fear and cry about me or my wife getting old and dying. My face hasn't tingled or felt like it is having microspasms for the past few days. The pressure in my forehead is gone. I haven't felt sick to my stomach (except today because I drank coffee- anytime my stomach feels bad I feel anxious, and vice versa). My breathing feels clearer, not really sure what that's about & maybe it's a placebo thing...or just the relief I feel in my body? I have had issues with brain fog but I also have sleep apnea and use CPAP but when my nose is really stuffed up I can't use it so I am not sure if that has improved yet or if it is related to anxiety or not so the verdict is still out on that one. Yesterday, I felt my brain fog was ""deeper"" in my mind, more central, rather than in my forehead if that makes sense, and then it lifted a few hours after I took my lexapro, but it could be that it dissipated once I got enough blood and oxygen flowing up there because I didnt use my cpap the night before lol.

I want to say that I am a very skeptical person and that after some bad experiences with psychedelics I was terrified of medication because I was terrified of having that feeling like I wasn't myself. After only 4 days I will say that I am upset that I didn't do this sooner. My mind feels relatively clear. I am living in the present. I feel more focused. I feel less fidgety. I actually don't think I've been shaking my legs for days now, and I don't feel like I'm going to explode if I'm not shaking them. My jaw isn't clenched. The only thing that I notice is that now that my mind isn't constantly active, I sometimes find myself just kind of staring into the imaginary abyss, not thinking, just sitting..but not worrying, or planning, or catastrophically thinking, or feeling a pain in my body thinking it's some disease. It's not a bad thing, just different. Now that my mind isn't so busy, I think I will finally have the mental capacity to do all the things I'd want to do but never start. I have even felt like leaving the house the past 2 days! I don't worry as much about my wife getting in a wreck or shot or anything like that. I think I may have ADHD as well, but I want to give this a couple months before I do anything else in terms of medication.

I (27) currently live with my mother (48) 

We handle cooking that we take turns who cooks and cook together sometimes if it work with my shifts.

At the beginning of November I decided to go 100% vegan.
Before that, we had already enjoyed cooking vegetarian and vegan meals and trying out alternatives, so I knew that she wasn't averse to eating vegan either.

She then said when it was her turn to cook or when we cooked together, we could make everything completely vegan, just for the convenience of not having to cook two dishes.

She also enjoyed trying out the vegan alternatives for cold cuts, cheese, etc., but still liked to put salami or cheese on her bread in the morning, put cow's milk in her coffee or eat an egg here and there. But I was just happy that she ate vegan main dishes with me and accepted that I didn't make any exceptions.

She eventually wanted to watch Dominion with me (which led me to veganism) but we haven't found the time yet.
But she gradually changed more and more things (e.g. instead of cow's milk only oat milk so that you don't always have to buy two types of milk) but she still had her animal products that she ""sometimes just needs""
So she basically ate a 90% plant-based diet

Well, I was on vacation last week and she bought herself a ""Eisbein"" (german pork dish)
While scrolling through Instagram, she accidentally stumbled across reels that showed clips from Dominion, for example. Uncensored and everything. We often send each other vegan recipes so I think the algorithm  just does that. (Maybe?)

She cried as she watched and thought a lot about the terrible images. She decided to still eat the pork (since she had already bought it) but couldn't enjoy it at all. 
(According to her) it just didn't taste good anymore and the images of the pigs in their little cages kept coming back to her mind.

Yesterday I came back from vacation and she told me that she wanted to live 100% vegan from now on. Even if I'm not there and if I move out sometime next year, she wants to stay vegan.

We spent yesterday cleaning out her non-vegan items and giving them to non-vegan family members (things like butter, honey, milk chocolate, etc.).
She doesn't own anything made of leather or fur anyway, and luckily her shampoo, etc. is also vegan.

Now I'll give her a lot of advice and we'll look through the ingredient lists together while we're shopping.
Anything that is not vegan will no longer be bought, regardless of whether it is food, clothing or cosmetics
I show her what ingredients she has to pay attention to, which nutrients are potentially critical, that she then has to take B12, etc.

I did a lot of research myself before (and after) going vegan and am currently using the knowledge to “coach” her 😅

That just makes me very happy. Both for the cause itself (each person counts) and for myself (at family celebrations in the future I will no longer be the only outsider who brings her own food and can't come to every restaurant)

I'm sorry for the long text but I just wanted to share something that I found very positive 😁",26,1737396878.0,vegan,4,0.97,False

From LA to Chicago and now in Dallas Texas to work at the American Airline center. Just arrived a few hours ago.

I have a degree in journalism. I went to college at Loyola University Chicago. Never know how to fill these out because no one reads them. But, a collection of random things about me, I love cookies, I prefer walking over driving, I’m a shopaholic, and I have an apartment with no furniture besides a couch and bed.

I’m rarely home since I’m always traveling for work. I like to shop before leaving a state so I’m always left with new outfits. Cookies and a glass of milk is my favorite to end a meal on. I’m getting older so I prefer to walk then drive to get my steps in. Great for cardio as well. In 2024 I hiked the Oregon trail doing over 40k steps, went sky diving in Australia, got in a doom buggy in Saudi Arabia, fresh baguettes and coffee in France, Holocaust memorial in Berlin, and a photo shoot that was cherry themed.

In 2025 I’m hoping to travel more. Around Asia and Europe. Kyoto, Mount Fuji, Phucket, Seoul, Venice, Barcelona, and Istanbul are all places I’m planning on going in 2025. Atleast 2 photoshoots in 2025. Hopefully these are not outlandish goals to have lol.

I ended up sharing a lot rather then keeping it short. Oh well. I’m planning to donate a lot of my outfits to make closet space. Maybe we can play a ‘keep or donate’ game where I’ll show the outfits and we decide if it’s a keep or a donate? Probably sounds like a dumb game but I’d be surprise if I manage to make a friend tonight to make it this far. Let’s see how this goes. (It never works out LOL)

Advice for the Bar Examinee (2016 ed.)
by: PROF. MANUEL R. RIGUERA

“The key is not the will to win.  Everybody has that.  It is the will to prepare to win that is important.” — Bobby Knight, Hall of Fame Basketball Coach.

I have put together some advice and tips for those about to sit for the bar examination.  These are based on my two decades’ experience as a law professor, bar review lecturer, and bar exam coach.   I hope that they will prove of some help to the examinee who aspires to hurdle one of the toughest bar examinations in the planet.     

BEFORE THE BAR EXAM

READ MATERIALS ON HOW TO PREPARE FOR AND PASS THE BAR EXAM.   The bar exam is not a matter to take lightly.  Hence reading materials on how to prepare for and to pass the bar will greatly increase your chances of seeing your name inscribed in the bar exam hall of fame.  You can bring these materials as light reading to your three-day vacation after law school graduation.    When I prepared for the 1991 bar, I read a well-worn pamphlet by Prof. Jose Nolledo, Pointers for a Bar Candidate (1960).  I also read a booklet by Commissioner Regalado Maambong on the bar examination.   The two booklets served me well by giving practical advice on how to prepare for the bar and how to avoid costly mistakes during the preparation and the actual taking of the bar.  

From the current crop of bar prep books, I strongly recommend Bar Blues (Central Books, 2013)written by Tanya Karina Lat, Maria Gracia Gamez, and Marilyn Manait.  Bar Blues is comprehensive yet very readable.  Slaying the Bar Exam Dragon by Dean Rufus Rodriguez is another book which I would advise you to read.  

PREPARE AND ORGANIZE YOUR REVIEW MATERIALS.  Prepare your list of reviewers after your graduation and buy those that you do not have.  Get the opinion of professors and last year’s bar examinees as they are the best judges of law reviewers and can give you the pros and cons of a particular reviewer. 

As for the copious annotations or commentaries that you used as textbooks during your first three years in law school, consult them only if you need examples or illustrations of particular legal provisions.  This is an area where annotations or commentaries have an advantage over most reviewers which tend to put too much emphasis on rules without giving the underlying fact pattern for such rule.  

In this regard, I strongly advise the use of reviewers which are in Q&A form or which give examples or illustrations of the rules.   This reviewers will serve the dual purpose of being a review material as well as a training material for answering the bar which is substantially made up of problem-type or fact-based questions. 

PREPARE A BAR REVIEW SCHEDULE.  A bar-review schedule is your road-map to navigating the six months of bar review.  If you are enrolled in a bar review center, synchronize your schedule with that of the bar review center.  Otherwise you will not be reviewing effectively.  It’s not advisable to listen to the lecturer discuss negotiable instruments and then go home and read up on labor relations.  In this regard, choose a bar review center wherein there is a topical unity and continuity in the schedule, that is, where one particular bar exam subject is discussed at a time before proceeding to another bar exam subject.  Avoid bar review centers with a hodgepodge schedule where for example, negotiable instruments is discussed on one day, then labor relations on the next, and then civil procedure on the day after. 

My advice is that you study one bar exam subject before going to another.  Some advise reviewing one subject in the first half of the day (say remedial law) and then another (say commercial law) in the second half of the day.  The avowed purpose is to avoid ennui.  I think this sacrifices focus and effectiveness just to add variety.   One must simply have the self-discipline and drive to study one bar subject at a time.

If you are not attending or viewing bar review lectures, you have to prepare your own detailed schedule.   A rule of thumb in dividing your study time is to multiply the number of days available for review with the weight given to a particular bar examination subject.  Let us say that you have 156 days allocated for your review (May to October, excluding Sundays).  Political law has a weight of 15%.   156 days multiplied by 15% will give you 23 days.   So you allocate 23 days more or less for political law. 

In your review schedule, the last bar subjects that you should study should be labor law and then political law (the so-called “mirror schedule).  This will enhance the effectiveness of your review since political law and labor law are the bar exam subjects you will tackle on the first Sunday.     

You should also prepare a daily study schedule.   The latter is a detailed daily planner of your wake-up time, meals, breaks, and your “lights out” which you should follow strictly in order to get into the groove of rigorous studying.  

I recommend that your wake-up time should be at 4:30 a.m. and “lights out” should be at 9 p.m.     This is to make your body clock adjust to this schedule so that by November, you would be used to sleeping and waking up early.

After you have drawn up your schedule, stick to it at all costs!  If you see that you are running behind schedule, pick up your pace.   This is the reason why you should select and prune your reading materials.  Many reviewees make the mistake of being overly ambitious in their study load with the result that they fall behind schedule.   Study smart!  The point is that you are not studying to be a legal authority but to pass the bar.  The bar reviewers (with rare exceptions) will not quiz you on arcane areas of the law.  Leave the scholarly stuff for later after you have passed the bar and have decided to write a law journal article.      

ENROLL IN A BARREVIEWCENTER.  There are advantages and disadvantages to enrolling in a bar review center.   Among the perceived disadvantages are the increased costs, which include the enrollment fee, the transportation and food costs, and accommodation costs for those who reside in the provinces.   Also quite some time is spent in preparing and dressing up and in going to and from the bar review center. 

Despite these considerations, I strongly recommend that a bar examinee enroll in a bar review center.   A law graduate does not have the degree of knowledge of the bar subject and the intuitive feel for what are the important topics and probable bar exam questions which an experienced bar review lecturer has.   Also a bar review center provides case and statutory updates, which because of time limitations, is often not provided by law schools. 

Take note that law and jurisprudence is in a constant state of flux and what you thought may have been good law last year or even last month may no longer be so.   Recent developments affect the law as a whole and not just specific or isolated provisions.  Hence these should not be taught or learned in a truncated or isolated manner but should be imparted to the reviewee in a holistic manner, that is, seamlessly woven into a bar review subject as an integral element thereof.    Only a seasoned bar lecturer, with his experience and intuitive feel of the law, is capable of performing this challenging feat.    A bar reviewee who relies on past review material and simply tries to incorporate “updates” into his study is playing with fire.          

A recent innovation is online bar review.  The bar reviewee need not go to a “brick-and-mortar” bar review center but can review in the comfort of his own home or wherever there is internet access.  This has the advantages of cost and time efficiency. 

In this regard, Jurists Bar Review is offering JURISTS COMBO, which combines the structured regimen and face-to-face coaching of the traditional review with the convenience and flexibility of an online review.

CHOOSE YOUR BAR REVIEW CENTER WISELY.  There are three important things which you should take into account in choosing a bar review center:  The line-up of lecturers, the schedule, and the existence of a coaching or mentoring program.

The line-up of lecturers is important.   Get the line-up and study this carefully. In appraising the line-up, get the opinion of successful bar examinees and your law professors.   Word usually gets around among the bar reviewees and the law academe about the outstanding and the mediocre or irresponsible lecturers.   Pay special attention to the lecturers in the subjects in which you feel you are weak.          

The schedule is also of capital importance.   Some bar review centers draw up their schedule based on the availability of the lecturers rather than on topical continuity.  As previously stated, avoid bar review centers with hodgepodge schedules.   This will greatly undercut the effectiveness of your study.

If you have taken the bar more than three times, ensure that the bar review center is run by a recognized law school or that it has an accreditation agreement with one.   The Supreme Court will not allow you to sit for the bar examination unless you get a certification from such a bar review center. 

TAKE MOCK BAR EXAMS AND AVAIL OF THE SERVICES OF A BAR-EXAM COACH.   Another thing to look out for is if the bar review center has a coaching program.   The program should not be limited to the mere administration of mock bar exams, but should provide for one-on-one coaching wherein a coach reads and evaluates the examinee’s answers and then sits down and discusses the same with the examinee, seeking to identify the examinee’s strong and weak points, to remedy the latter, to coach the examinee on how to read and answer the bar exam questions, and in general to improve and maximize the examinee’s test-taking abilities.     

See to it that the mock bars replicate the bar examination (that’s why they’re called mock bars) and that there is a series of mock bars and coaching sessions (not just one or two) so that there will be adequate feedback and performance monitoring. 

Professor Mario Mainero, one of the foremost bar prep experts in the U.S., advises thus: “taking a practice exam under exam conditions is the best way to prepare for an exam.  If you do not take them as actual run-throughs, your mind and body will not become used to taking law school [bar] exams, and you are more likely to freeze up or perform at a less-than-peak performance level.”  (Dennis Tonsing, 1000 Days to the Bar).     

Analyzing and answering bar exam questions is not a matter of gut feel or intuition.   The examinee who thinks that it is enough to just read and attend lectures when preparing for the bar is taking a huge risk.   A bar-exam coach or mentor would be most invaluable in helping the examinee acquire the necessary competencies for succeeding in the bar exam.

The high mortality rate in the bar examination is traceable to the sole or over-reliance on passive study and the absence or lack of training and practice on bar exam strategies and tactics.  This matter has been raised as early as 1959 by Dean Wenceslao G. Laureta in the preface to his classic Secrets on How to Pass the Bar Examination (Rex Book Store, 1959 ed.)

Thus, it may be proper to remind the bar candidates some of the myths involved in the domain of bar examinations.  Almost invariably the bar candidates have the mistaken belief that by – – (1) Attending the best law schools; (2) Listening to lectures of renowned bar reviewers during review classes; and (3) Memorizing the law or the  rules of procedure, including doctrinal rulings will guarantee his passing the bar examinations.

Wrong.

There is no question that the above circumstances will help to enable the bar candidate pass the bar examinations.  But the blooming secret in this regard is simply this:  Present good answers that will make the examiner take notice.  Good answers anchored upon logical reasoning, written in readable English and more importantly, justified by appropriate legal authority. 

…

It would do well for the bar candidate to study carefully the manner in which answers are framed and the corresponding comments given.  He will not fail to see why a given answer is poorly presented and the value of the corresponding remedy to improve it in a manner acceptable to the examiner.  He must not make the tragic mistake of assuming that he knows all these things.  He must supplement his reading by actual practice in answer framing.  After all, one may know all the techniques on swimming which he can master from books on the subject, but until he jumps into the water, he will never learn to swim.  [Emphases supplied]

Bar exam strategies and tactics is a nuanced field which cannot be acquired from merely reading books and listening to omnibus lectures. The services of a competent bar exam coach or mentor would be most helpful.  A mock bar and coaching program is also in line with the recent pedagogical trend of shifting stress to “outcome-based education” from the conventional “input-based learning.”

The Supreme Court itself recognized the salient role played by mock bars and bar exam coaching.  The Guidelines for the 2014 Bar recommend thus:

Practice Exams

A good practice for law schools/review classes to observe is to hold practice examination sessions with the Bar candidates, both on the Essay and the MCQ formats. In evaluating these practice exams, attention should be given to both the law and the Bar candidate’s presentation and use of English. In many instances, incorrect English is more serious as a problem than the lack of precise knowledge of law, and has been the cause of high failure rates. [Emphases supplied]

In line with the Supreme Court’s observation, Jurists has brought back the lecture “English for Bar Examinees” in order to train the bar examinees write in correct, readable, and concise English.  This would be especially helpful for those who need improvement in their legal writing and English proficiency as the course would provide them with helpful tips in order to surmount their challenges. 

FOCUS ON THE FUNDAMENTALS IN YOUR BAR REVIEW.  The key is not really studying more but studying smart.   It is simply impossible to read during the five months of review the entire code provisions of a law much less the texts or annotations thereon.   Besides some code provisions and comments are unimportant for purposes of the bar and are seldom if ever asked in the bar.  

During your review, you need to concentrate only on the primary review materials:  a bar reviewer, the code provisions, and the bar review materials provided by the bar review center.   In reading the code provisions, do not read the entire code but only those which are important.   You know a code provision is important if it was discussed by your professor or bar review lecturer or mentioned in your bar reviewer.           

A useful supplement to your reviewer is the Lex Pareto Notes written by Zigfred Diaz, Maria Patricia Katrina de Guia, Alrey Ouano, Louella Matsumoto, Ma. Salud Barillo, Danell Fernandez, Nolito Dayanan, and Helenytte Yu.    This is a breakthrough work wherein the authors, applying the Pareto Principle to the field of bar exam review and forecasting, have found that approximately 80% of the bar exam questions are derived from 20% of the law.  The authors have pinpointed this 20% of the law on which the reviewee should spend 80% of his study time thus optimizing the effectiveness of his review.

Many reviewees ask me if they should also read the survey of bar exam questions and answers published by the U.P. Law Center.  My answer would be yes, but not as a primary review material but as a supplemental training material.  You may from time to time pick some questions from the Q&A and then answer them without looking at the suggested answers.   Needless to state the services of a certified bar exam coach to evaluate your answers and give written feedback is strongly advised as “self-coaching” has its drawbacks.  

TAKE CARE OF YOUR HEALTH AND FITNESS.   Remember to exercise daily or at least three times a week.  Exercising improves blood circulation to the brain and makes one think more clearly.  It also builds up one’s resistance to sickness and infection and improves one’s stamina.  Remember that the bar exam is a grueling four-hour exam in the morning and another one in the afternoon. So I’m not greatly exaggerating when I say that it’s like training for a 20-kilometer run. I’m not saying though that you should train like a triathlete – – brisk walking or a short jog will do.       

Get enough sleep.  At least six to seven hours of daily sleep is advised.  Lack of sleep will result in drowsiness and sluggishness when studying, aside from making you susceptible to sickness or fatigue.      

Proper diet is often overlooked but it is of the utmost importance.  Observe a balanced and healthy diet, not forgetting fruits and vegetables. Please take it easy on fast food especially instant noodles!  (Well, from time to time fast food is alright but don’t make it your staple food).  A diet which would send a cardiologist into fits is not likewise appropriate for a bar reviewee.  For coffee drinkers, black coffee is the best.  Take it easy with the popular “3-in-1” coffee preparations which tend to contain a lot of sugar and fat.  Drink plenty of water when studying.

In fine take care of your health.   Good health is the foundation of an outstanding bar review. 

IMPROVE YOUR HANDWRITING.  Handwriting is of capital importance in the essay exams.  Your answers may all be logical and correct but if your handwriting is illegible all your hard work will go down the drain.   If your handwriting is difficult to read, the examiner will most probably not take the time to decipher your booklet, taking into consideration that he has about five thousand other booklets to read.  

You may think that your handwriting is legible when it’s actually not.   Take a mock bar examination and show your booklet to another person and have him read it.  You may be surprised to find that your handwriting is actually difficult to read.  If that is the case, work on improving your handwriting.  

DURING NOVEMBER AND THE BAR EXAM 

AVOID UNNECESSARY STRESS AND DISTRACTIONS.   Some stress and nerves is unavoidable during the review and exam week and in fact helps to drive you harder in your studies.  However undue and excessive stress and nerves is an enemy of the bar examinee as it results in lack of sleep and hinders proper thinking both while studying and taking the exam itself.  If you feel that you are unduly stressed or worried, learn relaxation techniques like yoga and deep breathing.   Prayer and meditation are powerful relaxation techniques. 

Ignore useless distractions.   Usually rumors of who the examiner is become widespread during this time and examinees worry themselves silly with the type of questions the rumored examiner usually asks and with obtaining notes and materials written by or about the rumored examiner.  This is just a useless exercise which would distract you from doing what should be done:  studying.  All examiners are in the main bound by an unwritten law that their questions should be on the basics of the law and on significant jurisprudence.   So just ignore rumors or information on the examiner’s identity and stick your nose to your review materials.   

The bar exam month features the annual frenetic paper chase by bar examinees.  Examinees go on a quest for the Holy Grail of the bar exams:  the red or blue notes from San Beda or Ateneo or the UP notes.   These notes are supposed to embody the answers or even “leaks” of bar exam questions.   This is balderdash.  I graduated from Ateneo and worked in the bar-ops.  I know that the so-called blue notes are simply compilations of probable bar questions with answers prepared by law students with a little assistance from the faculty.   While they are definitely helpful, you don’t have to wail and grind your teeth if you do not get them.   What is contained in the blue notes is more often than not also in your bar reviewers and review materials. 

One examinee I knew spent a lot more time looking for notes, tips, and leaks and compiling dossiers on the rumored examiners rather than actually studying.   He failed the bar five times and is now exploring career opportunities with the CIA. 

GET ENOUGH SLEEP ON THE NIGHT BEFORE THE EXAM.     This advice cannot be overemphasized.    Adequate sleep makes the mind sharper and allows us to recall what we have studied with facility.   So do not make the mistake of studying until the witching hour.   The extra hours of study is not worth it if you find yourself sleepy and thinking sluggishly during the bar exam. 

You should hit the sack by 9 p.m.   Do not panic if you find that you are unable to sleep.  Just relax and continue lying down in bed, at least your body will be rested.  But do not make the mistake of standing up and studying.   In that case you will lack both sleep and rest, and the chances of a disaster are multiplied threefold.   Ron de Vera slept for only an hour the night before the first Sunday exam and for only 30 minutes the night before the second Sunday exam of 2004.   He placed second.  (Lat et al., Bar Blues, p. 85).   Of course I’m not saying that you get only an hour’s sleep if you want to place in the top ten, what I’m saying is that there is no need for you to call 911 if you find yourself unable to fall into the arms of Morpheus.       

I advise against taking sleeping pills.   They often have the side effect of muddling up your thinking.  There was an examinee who, finding himself unable to sleep the night before the Civil Law exam, popped a sleeping pill.  He was able to sleep all right, but the next day he found himself unable to distinguish between loco parentis and crazy momma. 

REMEMBER TO FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS.  Before you start reading and answering the questions, take the time to first read and understand the instructions.  Quite a lot of examinees in their eagerness go straight to reading and answering the questions without bothering to read the instructions.  This could be disastrous.   

NEVER LEAVE ANY QUESTION UNANSWERED.   Even if you are clueless as to the answer to a question, give it your best try.   Never leave any question unanswered.   The examiner may feel slighted if you do not answer a question.  He may think that you felt that the question was not properly crafted that is why did not answer it.  Moreover a blank response will get you zero while giving it your best shot could net you 2 or 3 points which could spell the difference between flunking and passing.

MANAGE YOUR TIME WISELY.  Many examinees spend too much time on the first part of the exam only to find themselves rushing through the second part or worse running out of time and leaving some questions unanswered.    Learn to pace yourself properly.   Taking mock bar exams will help you learn how to pace yourself in an 18-to-20 question examination. 

DO NOT BE FLUSTERED BY “SHOCK AND AWE” QUESTIONS.   Those who took the 1991 Bar Examination (like me) will never forget the infamous first question in Political Law:  “What is the Writ of Amparo?  Discuss its constitutional basis.”     Considering that the only Amparo we knew of was Amparo Muñoz (the 1974 Miss Universe who won her title in Manila, if you’re a Millennial), the question had the effect of a sneak punch to the solar plexus.   I can still picture in my mind the bar exam room at MLQU, with everyone’s jaw plunging to the floor in utter shock.

Of course, now every law student knows what a writ of amparo is, but back then in 1991 B.G. (before Google), only a law student or law professor who had travelled to Latin America could have known of this most extraordinary writ.  

Other “shock and awe” questions include one which asked who the current president of the International Court of Justice was, one which asked for the meaning of the acronym ACID (from a speech of Chief Justice Artemio V. Panganiban), and another which asked the examinee to define the Denicola test in intellectual property law.

“Shock and awe” questions were trending in the 2015 Bar. In Political Law, bar examinees were asked to discuss the “evolution” of jus sanguinis under the 1935, 1973, and 1987 Constitutions.  In Labor Law, the word of the day was “equity of the incumbent,” an anachronism whose term of office had long ago expired.  In Civil Law, they were asked to define “depecage.”  In Commercial Law, the shock-and-awe word to define was “Jason Clause.”  In Remedial Law,  the examinees were confronted with the common-law terms, “larceny” and “voir dire.” It did not help any that “larceny” was used in a fact-setting which did not involve any unlawful taking of property but rather violence and sexual abuse, while “voir dire” is a term that a Filipino lawyer would be unfamiliar with unless he is an aficionado of American jury trials.

The examiners’ penchant for throwing screwball questions put the bar examinees in a serious funk. Many spent quite a bit of time accumulating a glossary of legal gobbledygook in the various bar exam subjects instead of studying the fundamentals and important jurisprudence.  I even heard a story (probably apocryphal) that a law school engaged a lexicographer to beef up its bar ops.

This brought back memories of the 1991 bar examination.  After the examinees were torched by the Amparo question in political Law, the succeeding preweek reviews were turned into a Gobbledygook chase.   The fad back then was the M&A (mergers & acquisitions) craze in Wall Street (remember Michael Milkin and Ivan Boesky with his infamous “Greed is Good” mantra).  In the mercantile law preweek, we parroted terms like “hostile take-over,” “leveraged buy-out,” “white knight,” “junk bonds,” and a plethora of other investment-bank junk rather, jargon.  I think this was partly to blame for the dismal pass rate of 17.81%.   An examinee who flunked the bar “leveraged” his experience to apply for and land a job in the M&A department of a leading investment bank.     

My advice is that a bar candidate should not spend precious time burning the midnight oil with Black’s Law Dictionary. A cost-benefit analysis would lead one to conclude that time spent on looking for and even studying obscure legal nomenclature would only result in dividends that are well, de minimis. Better to just study the basic legal principles and significant jurisprudence and encounter legal terms in the course of such study.

Moreover, screwball questions are not really expected to be answered correctly by the majority of the examinees (and even law professors) but are meant more to test the resolve and fortitude of one who aspires to be a lawyer.    Do not panic or lose hope if you do not know the answer to the question.  Just give it your best try and proceed to the other questions.

AFTER THE EXAM

DO NOT DISCUSS THE ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS.   After you have taken a bar exam in a particular subject, forget about it and concentrate on preparing and studying for the next bar exam subject.   After all you cannot undo what you have already written.   Avoid discussing the probable answers and avoid people who delight in discussing them.  The time spent on arguing and discussing the probable answers is better spent relaxing and preparing for the next exam. 

CONCLUSION

To paraphrase Bobby Knight, the key is not the will to pass.  Everybody has that.  It is the will to prepare to pass that is important. 

The bar exam is a formidable challenge but like any other hurdle it can be surmounted by assiduous planning and preparation.  The following quote from Steve Nash, a player of less than imposing physical attributes but who went on to become one of the NBA all-time greats, is inspiring:

You have to rely on your preparation.  You got to really be passionate and try to prepare more than anyone else, and put yourself in a position to succeed, and when the moment comes you got to enjoy, relax, breathe and rely on your preparation so that you can perform and not be anxious or filled with doubt.   

When your moment comes, enjoy it!

1i5wqgn,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1i5wqgn/never_fall_for_the_bartender_advice/,Never fall for the bartender? Advice ,"I might already know the answer to this but here goes. About 2 months ago I stopped into a neighborhood bar and met a bartender. The bar is a total dive and bartender’s first language is not English . I speak her first language and was able to laugh and communicate with her the entire time I was there. Subsequently, I would stop by her shifts for about an hour and talk. I typically would leave a generous tip comparable to the bill. We started texting each other and would text most days -moreso when she was working . 

As the weeks progressed , I would bring her coffee when I got off of work and even flowers a few times. She seemed interested and engaged, but from time to time I would be messaged asking to come and “hang with her “ at the bar. While she would toss in a few free ones or a shot, it was typically the same result . I spent more than I expected, stayed longer than I expected and tipped more than expected . While we would talk, she was working and would tend to other patrons . Now the place isn’t the best place and is really is a dive , so she was entertaining older men and laughing off their comments .

I asked to see her outside of the bar. The first attempt, she reportedly left her phone in a friends car the night before and had only gotten the phone back later in the day . Second attempt, when I texted her I was in route to where we agreed, she said she had not showered yet and would be another hour before she would make it . I told her , nah maybe next time .

Our bar friendship progressed to hugs when I arrived and hugs and a kiss on the cheek when I left. Flirtation over text and in person (but in her language when at the bar as to not encourage others). She had always appeared to be receptive. 

Finally after another few weeks of texting and flirting and chatting we agreed to see each other after her early shift . As the day got closer she told me she was sick all week (this much is true) and couldn’t promise me that she would feel up to going out . Sure enough , the day came. She did not want to go out but instead sat next to me at the bar because she sick. As she sat next to me I placed my hand on her leg . After a minute she moved it . I said sorry . 

She left shortly after. However , she was texting the entire evening and I heard her confirm to another person at the bar that she was going out after her shift . I thought it was with me.

Anyway, she left in an uber ordered by her friend. I asked her out to lunch and she is telling me that I made her feel uncomfortable that time and she doesn’t want to feel uncomfortable. 

So

Was she really into me? Or was it just the attention and tips? 

Yes, I understand consent , but is a hand on a leg given the above a deal breaker? 

Is the leg incident an excuse to curb something that has gone too far ?

One day I was sat down with my coffee in the living room and my dog ran off into the kitchen. Then she ran back into the living room. I wondered what she had done since she never leaves my side and is basically attached to me at the hip. So I go into the kitchen and realised she had peed on the floor. I cleaned it up and went back to the living room to see her licking the whipped cream off the top of my coffee. 

I just wanted to know if she genuinely needed to pee and couldn’t hold it anymore or if she did it to distract me from my coffee?",1,1737396763.0,DogAdvice,1,1.0,False

1i5wpeg,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1i5wpeg/miele_vs_jura_brew_groups/,Miele vs Jura Brew groups.,"I've had the CM6350 for almost eight years, and it's been great—no issues at all, and I still love it. However, due to medical reasons, my wife can no longer have anything with caffeine. To accommodate this, I've developed a system through trial and error where I add just the right amount of beans to ensure I can hear the burr grinder run empty.

While this workaround has been effective, it's clear this situation isn't temporary. So, I'm considering getting a replacement. Initially, I thought about the CM7, but then I came across Jura's dual-hopper models—the J8 Twin and the Giga 10.

The J8 Twin seems less suitable for me because of its separate milk spout, which I think could disrupt my coffee-making routine. So I think it's between the CM7 and the Giga 10.

My main question is about Jura's non-removable brew group. I'm used to cleaning the CM6350's brew group by rinsing and brushing it manually. Why does Jura design their machines this way? Is there a specific reason for not allowing users to remove and clean the brew group themselves?",0,1737396698.0,superautomatic,8,0.33,False
