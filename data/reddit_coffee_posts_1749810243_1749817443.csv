Plasterer has taken 40% upfront, barely turned up, then called us “the worst customers he’s ever had” — what can we do? (UK)

We’re really at our wits’ end and unsure what to do next, so any advice would be appreciated.

We hired a plasterer for a job and agreed on a start date of 2 June. We paid him a 10% deposit upfront. Before starting, he messaged asking for an extra £500 for materials. We paid it.

Then he delayed the job by a full week, saying he’d now start on 9 June. The night before (8 June), he messaged again asking for another £500, saying he couldn’t pay the delivery guy as he had no money. Reluctantly, we paid that too — we just wanted the work to start.

On Monday 10 June, he finally turned up. Within an hour, he said his wife was unwell and rushed off. Since then:
	•	Tuesday: no show.
	•	Wednesday: turned up for half a day.
	•	Thursday & Friday: no show again.

The only consistent presence has been a young lad he’s left here, who’s doing some basic prep work — no plastering has even started. We’ve been very kind to the lad, offered him tea, coffee, even lent him our personal steamer because they turned up completely unprepared.

Yesterday, we asked the lad whether they’d be working the weekend to catch up, and he said he didn’t know. Apparently he phoned the plasterer after that.

This morning (Friday), at 7am, the plasterer calls my husband and says we are “the worst customers he’s ever had” — just for asking a reasonable question. My husband, being very non-confrontational, asked when the work will be done. The plasterer said he’ll come on Monday — but at this point, we honestly don’t trust him to turn up.

We’ve now paid around 40% of the total quote, and we’ve had no plastering work done at all.

We’re not aggressive people. We’ve been respectful, paid every time he’s asked (perhaps too trusting), and tried to accommodate delays — and now we’re being insulted and ghosted.

Where do we stand legally? Can we cancel the job and try to get our money back? We have WhatsApp messages as proof of the money he asked for and what was agreed. We’re feeling very stuck and don’t want to lose any more money or time.

Any advice or similar experiences would really help. Thanks in advance.",1,1749817390.0,Plastering,0,1.0,False

Seems like it keeps being extended over and over. Maybe people don’t want to spend over $1,000 on an espresso machine from a company that A) currently doesn’t sell an espresso grinder that matches it in quality and B) follows the quality control issues and app failings of Aiden Precision Coffee Maker?

This isn’t meant to be a dunk on Fellow, I have an Aiden and have had zero issues and have loved it. But at the same time, it really doesn’t seem like this product should’ve been released currently at the price point that it was built for.

Fellow should’ve built an espresso grinder on the quality level and price similar to Ode. It’s way simpler of a product and allows more resources to focus on improving Aiden. Then following up on the grinder with a cheaper Fellow Espresso Machine ($900 or less). If you want to release the Espresso Series 1 later on, that’s fine.

Still I decided to check and see if she was out on my way to work and here she is again. I saw at least one person and he said he sees her out a lot and doesn't think she has a family. Someone else said no she's someone's pet that's why she stays in the area. 

I'm torn, she's super friendly and if she's someone's cat I'd hate to steal her. Conversely she looks as if she could give birth any day.

1. OPENING SHOT
Rows of gray cubicles. A clock ticks to 8:59 AM. Employees shuffle in with coffee.

2. CONFERENCE ROOM – 9:00 AM

BRIANNA stands at the head of a long table. TREVOR fiddles with a projector remote. KATE sips coffee. MARK leans back in his chair. LINDA sits at the far end, notebook open.

BRIANNA (clapping hands)
Alright team, let’s get started. Big quarter ahead—sales are up, but production’s lagging. Trevor, status?

TREVOR (clicks remote; slide reads “GO PAPER OR GO HOME”)
Thanks, Bri. We’ve pushed the “Go Paper” campaign; social-media impressions are up 12%, but physical orders haven’t caught up.

BRIANNA
Good on the buzz. Kate, any word on staffing?

KATE (deadpan)
We hired three seasonal temps. One thought fax machines were extinct. The other two… still on orientation.

MARCUS (smirking)
Orientation’s been running since February.

LINDA (raising hand timidly)
Actually, I think they’re just really enthusiastic about learning.

BRIANNA (encouraging)
That’s the spirit! Linda, how’s your first week?

LINDA (bright)
I’ve organized the archives, updated our LinkedIn, and—oh—I may have accidentally ordered 500 boxes of “ultra-white” instead of standard.

TREVOR (aghast)
500 boxes?! That’s—uh—creative budgeting.

KATE
Well, at least we’ll look dazzling while drowning in inventory.

Forklifts maneuver around towering shelves. MARK stands beside LINDA, surveying boxes stamped “ULTRA-WHITE.”

MARK
You know, if you mix “ultra-white” with “ivory” you might summon a paper-mageddon.

LINDA

BRIANNA paces.

BRIANNA
Okay, team—Plan B. Marcus, you’ll spearhead an eco-friendly campaign. Trevor, draft a “Paper-Power” newsletter. Kate, prepare a mini-workshop on machine handling for the temps. Linda, maybe just… don’t order any more paper this week.

LINDA (sheepish)
Got it.

BRIANNA (smiles)
Great! Meeting adjourned. Let’s make Scranton proud!

Everyone stands. As they exit:

MARCUS (to Linda, sotto)

We knew each other from school (he was a senior) and reconnected recently. The conversations were fun, flirty, and I was open to meeting him in person to see where things might go.

When we started planning a first date, he kept suggesting we go to a bar and get drinks. I personally don’t feel super comfortable drinking with someone I haven’t met properly yet, especially on a first date. I live in India, where that kind of setting—especially as a woman—can feel a little unsafe or just… not ideal unless I already know/trust the person.

So I subtly tried to suggest alternatives like coffee or lunch, hoping he’d take the hint. But every time, he pushed for drinks again. It wasn’t aggressive or anything, but it felt dismissive of my comfort. After a few back-and-forths like this, I ended up just losing interest and stopped replying.

Now I’m wondering: was that unfair of me? Should I have been more direct instead of ghosting him? Or was I right to just dip if I wasn’t feeling respected or unsure? ",0,1749817102.0,AITAH,3,0.5,False

1laee83,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1laee83/th_the_walk_on_a_desolate_road/,[TH] The walk on a desolate road.,"He had to walk along the dark and desolate road every day after work to reach his home. The old man's dark complexion and his scarred face made him a frightening sight. One glance at the man and people would assume that he was a criminal. But in truth the man was an honest and kind person. He never held any grudges, never fought with anyone and was very humble to the core, knowing his place in the societal hierarchy. The poor man always knew how to be content with whatever he had and tried his best to provide his family.  The road leading up to his house didn't fit with its surrounding architecture. The road was located in a prominent location within a bustling city, but still was desolate as it cut through big housing plots, and had compounds on both sides with big trees and bushes. The road did saw a fair amount of commute during the day, but at night it was deserted. And the man always had to walk during the night after ending his shift. After being hired for the job, the man had walked without any hesitation the first few days. But eventually he grew tired of walking the long distance every day and the labour intensive work that his job required would wear him out. Being a man in his late 40s, it was hard for the old man to walk home after a gruelling day of work. One day, while walking home, his knees gave up and it became hard to walk. The Man thought of asking for a lift from people who were passing by. Seeing his demeanour, even tough guys weighing a hundred kilos refused to stop and give the guy a lift to his home. Each passing day, his knees deteriorated and it became hard for him to walk. Every day the man would ask for a lift and no one would stop. Even if somebody did, they would refuse later seeing the man's face up close. One day the man even saw a person getting a lift by someone who refused him a ride few days earlier. The man was making deductions as to why he wasn't getting a ride home, but the poor man couldn't come up with any. It was summer and some people from the man's workplace were on leaves for vacations. The few workers left had to bear the load and deliver by working extra time. That day the man was totally exhausted by toiling all day, but somehow he managed to complete his work. Ecstatic at first, the man left the place in hurry to return home, but as he left the compound, he suddenly remembered that he has to walk the desolate road again. Reaching halfway through the road, the old man's knees gave up completely and he started dragging his feet along. He was desperate for a lift now more so than ever. He started looking out for one but there were no people on the road as he left his workplace late. His feet couldn't move no more so he sat on a nearby rock and waited for someone to pass by. Suddenly a dim yellow glow lit the dark road and the man heard a low rumbling voice. Finally, he saw a passerby and hoped he would get a ride home. When she saw the old man sitting on a rock from afar, a wave of fear struck the woman and she started regretting her decision of using the desolate road at this time. The man desperate for a ride home, jumped in front of her and begged for a lift. The man looked so hideous up close that the woman screamed with all her life. 
Luckily, Two men passing down that road heard her screams and ran towards it. When they came closer, they saw her running away in the opposite direction from the man, leaving her scooter on the ground. The man dragging himself behind her to explain, looked like a hunting zombie in the dark. The woman saw those two men and screamed for help. The men told her to calm down and assured her that there was no need to be afraid. The woman catching her breath, explained the men how the old man jumped in front of her bike and tried to do something with her, maybe rob or rape her. She was not sure. The mere suggestion of someone troubling the innocent women made the men furious. They walked up to the man, and grabbed him to interrogate. The man tried his best to explain, but his horrifying face didn't do him any good. The men started beating the poor man. The more he tried to explain, the more he got of those fists. Those attacks just added to the man's existing scars, both on his face and his psyche. Something changed from that day on, the once kind and humble man had turned cynical. The man who once spoke with utmost sincerity now became rude. He would dismiss people who tried to understand this abrupt change in him. The man knew loss, grieved over several unwanted happenings of his life but never for once in his life was he mistreated in such a harmful way. He never got involved in any fight or even argument of any sort as he always believed in peace. But that day on, these peaceful beliefs vanished from his mind. Maybe they fell out while the men were punching him, or maybe they faded with the sound of that woman's scream. From that day onwards, the man would finish his work and March straight to his house. He never bothered to ask for a lift after that incident . He just kept ignoring his knees and would drag himself home every day. One day while walking home, he saw the same woman on her scooter riding past him. She didn't saw him but the old man's weak eyes recognized her even in the dark. A significant amount of blood gushed in to the nerve travelling across his brain. His scarred face turned red in anger, and suddenly he got a feeling which he never had before. He wanted to smash her face like he smashed up iron at this workplace. He suppressed the dreadful feeling and just moved ahead. A few days passed and the man would see the woman again and again till the time that he would see her daily. Her presence would just pile up his anger and bring him closer to the idea of smashing her head for real. The workers had to turn in all the tools before leaving the compound every day. But that day the man kept a pointed file with him in his tiffin bag. The file was flat on one side but had a pointy edge on the other side, sharp enough to cut through flesh. He stepped on the road, and kept walking till he saw the rock. He waited for her on the rock. She took her time, but eventually the dim yellow glow of her scooter showed up and the man got up, readying himself with the file in his hand. The man started walking in the same direction slowly to hide his face and not startle the woman. As the woman got closer, he suddenly jumped in front of her. The woman's reflexes kicked in and she hit the brakes, slightly bumping into the old man. The man quickly grabbed the handle, moved behind her scooter and sat on the pillion seat. Before the woman could cope up with anything and scream for help, the man held the pointy edge of the file to her throat. He specifically instructed her to not scream because if she did, he assured her that he would slit her throat. The woman offered him money, or even her scooter, but he declined. She started assuming the worst, he was here to rape her. But he wasn't interested in that too. When the sobbing woman asked what he was interested in, the man with a very generous tone, said that he only wanted a ride home. At first the woman was surprised to hear this demand, still speculating, the woman thought he would have whatever he wanted once they reached his destination. She started the scooter and slowly moved ahead, trying to keep the balance with her shivering body. As they moved forward, the man kept talking with her. He told her about his native place, his younger days, about his family and friends and sometimes about his work. His tone so normal that one would think that they were chatting over a coffee. Only the difference was that this conversation was one sided and she was only listening because of the knife that was hanging near her throat. The constant tearing up of her eyes made it impossible to see on the dimly lit road. She was somehow managing until they came across a bump on the road. She failed to anticipate the severity of the bump and it jolted on the old scooter hard. Due to the inertia, the old man momentarily lost control and the weapon in his hand made a small cut on the woman's neck. Assuming that the old man had slit her throat, the woman left both her hands from the scooter's handle and held her neck to check on the cut. In all that chaos, she lost control over the scooter and a few moments later, the scooter was hugging the ground. The man anticipating the fall jumped from the scooter, but the poor woman was trapped under it. She looked around hoping that somebody would help her, but she soon realised that they were alone on the road and her judgement was near. The man suddenly coming to his senses, dragged himself to help the woman. As he tried to come closer, the woman raised her voice. She started weeping like a little child, begging him to spare her. The poor woman was already in agony as the entire weight of the scooter was on her leg. When she saw that the man with the pointy file in his hand was closing in on her, she screamed for help. She screamed as loud as her voice could be, desperately trying to free her trapped leg. The screams which brought hope to the desperate woman, brought painful memories back to the mind of the old man. Those were the same screams that made his night miserable, that made him feel like a vermin. That was it, the scream triggered him furiously and he charged at the screaming woman with his weapon. The man who was once moving towards her with the intention of helping her was now determined to silence her. His actions weren't in control of himself, it was as if something had possessed him. He grabbed her by the chin and stabbed the woman straight in the front of her neck, assuring her silence. The blood splattered across the man's face, and then it kept flowing on the road painting it red. The woman choked on the flowing blood and then finally fell silent. The man slightly picked up the scooter and moved it aside to free the woman. He picked her up and threw her in the bushes nearby. Taking out a handkerchief from his pocket, he wiped off the blood from his face. He picked up the bloodied scooter and parked it in the place. He didn't do much to hide his crime. He left all the evidence at the crime scene itself. He had nothing to hide, neither was he scared of the consequences of his actions. He wanted a ride home and he got that. He walked what few steps had left to his home. The pain in his knees was obsolete. Or maybe they were paining, but he didn't care. After a long time, instead of dragging himself, he was walking as he once used to.

Most of my college friends who were in Mumbai have moved out after graduation, and while the folks at my internship are great, it’s a small setup and most of them have families, so they’re understandably busy on weekends.

I love the energy around here in this city and I feel that it would be a shame if i dont make the most out of my time here. I love to talk about investments, entrepreneurship, books, tv/movies ,etc .

If anyone else is in a similar boat — new to the city or not, looking to explore, grab a coffee, or just hang out — I’d love to connect! I also hit the gym every morning around 6:30 AM, so if you're into that and want a workout buddy, even better.

I swear, every third comment in crypto forums or trading subreddits is people asking if it’s legit or just another flashy trading platform that promises too much. Well, I decided to dig deep and see what the fuss is about.

With the rise of **automated trading platforms** like Bitcoin Era and Immediate Edge, many of us are curious about whether these tools can actually help us make some passive income—or if they’re just slick marketing traps. Oil Veltrix is gaining traction fast, and if you’ve ever thought, “Could this actually work for me?”, you’re not alone.

In this review, I’ll break down **exactly what Oil Veltrix is**, how it works, who’s behind it, and whether it's worth your time (and money). I’ll also go over the pros, cons, features, and my personal take. Let’s get into it.

## What is Oil Veltrix?

Oil Veltrix is an **automated trading platform** that claims to help users trade assets like oil, cryptocurrencies, forex, and stocks using AI-driven algorithms. Basically, it’s designed to do the heavy lifting for you—analyzing the market, spotting trends, and executing trades based on pre-set preferences or real-time data.

The idea is pretty simple: you don’t have to be a Wall Street pro to trade. The platform’s AI handles technical analysis, making it easier for both new and experienced traders to potentially earn profits with less effort. Think of it like having a trading assistant that never sleeps and doesn’t get emotional about money.

## Who Created Oil Veltrix?

Now here’s where it gets a little fuzzy. There’s **no clear founder or team** listed publicly, which is super common for platforms in this space. It’s not necessarily a red flag, but it does make it harder to verify the credibility behind the technology.

What we do know is that Oil Veltrix shares some design and structural similarities with platforms like **Bitcoin Code** and **Immediate Edge**. That suggests it might be developed by the same umbrella group or tech team. These platforms often use white-label software that’s reskinned with different branding but offers similar features.

So while we can’t point to a specific person or company behind Oil Veltrix, its functionality and interface are in line with others that have been operational for years.

## How Does Oil Veltrix Work?

Oil Veltrix uses **automated trading bots** powered by AI algorithms. These bots scan live market data to identify profitable trading opportunities and execute trades based on user-defined parameters (or default settings if you're a beginner). 

Here’s how it breaks down:
- The AI monitors market conditions 24/7.
- It uses indicators, news sentiment, and historical data to generate signals.
- Once it finds a match according to your risk profile and goals, it places trades automatically.
- You can watch trades happen in real time or set it to run passively.

You still have full control—set stop-losses, daily limits, or even turn off auto-trading if you want to go manual. There's also a **demo mode**, so you can test everything without risking actual money.

## Oil Veltrix Pros and Cons

Here’s my honest take after testing the platform for a couple of weeks:

**Pros**
- **Beginner-friendly UI** that doesn’t overwhelm you with charts.
- **Demo account** lets you practice before going live.
- **Multi-asset support** (crypto, oil, forex, stocks).
- **24/7 automated trading** with minimal manual input.
- Withdrawals processed within **1-2 business days**.
- Compatible with mobile and desktop browsers.

**Cons**
- **No official mobile app**, just a mobile-friendly website.
- **Lack of transparency** about the creators or company.
- **Regulatory status unclear**, so proceed with caution.
- You still need to **monitor market conditions** to avoid wild swings.

Or a guy who wants to suck on Sydney Sweeney's breasts and comments about her in meme posts (which are posted by guys who only watch her nude scenes or check out her cleavage moments ınstead of actually watching the stuff she plays in), can he ever get do that in real life?

After work when we were going back to the Clackamas area where her parents lived The roads became very icy. When we are getting off the freeway it was so slippery we barely missed the concrete divider on the clover leaf  We exited. Being silly people that knew nothing about ice storms who came from California, We decided to stop at Denny's to drink some coffee. 
A while later we left Denny's to drive over the freeway to go to her parents house. I had to sleep in the car because her parents wanted us to respect not having sex under their roof. I didn't complain because I just moved up here and I was trying to get my bearings on how to adjust to life in Portland.

I looked up beside me and saw a hooded figure. I did not have any fear and I did not feel any pain. I knew that this hooded figure was some sort of escort for me. But nothing was said between us at any point. He took meto  a bedroom with a couple sleeping on the bed. I remember not really understanding why we were there. We were at the foot of the bed, then all of the sudden the woman who was on the right side woke up like she was having a nightmare. Has she gasped, she looked around the room to see if there was somebody there but could not see us. And the hooded figure pointed to the side through the wall with his hand. At that second I flew through the wall through space and time, or whatever I was in and landed in my body. 
When I landed in my body I struggle to move but I could not move. I also seem to be half, not alive. As I struggle not not moving I could see out the back of my head. When I realized that I was looking out the back of my shoulder I got scared and then snapped into my body correctly. 
When I woke up I looked around the car I was sleeping in, ice completely covered all the windows so I could not see outside. I still did not understand that the predicament I was in. I didn't think anything of it because I was warm, so I went back to sleep. 
The next morning Ashley came out to the car to get me to go eat breakfast. We struggled to get the door open because the ice Had made a giant shell over the entire car about an inch thick. The ice on the street, underneath the car was so thick that it came up to just below the door.
For years I didn't think anything of it, I thought I was having an out of body experience. It wasn't until after the Holy Spirit gave me the blue rose that I understood that I had died and had a near-death experience.",1,1749816438.0,TrueChristian,0,1.0,False

I’m curious if anyone here used this kind of casual, in-person approach before applying to an accelerator to meet co-founders, early team members, or just get traction in building a core.

1lae8s4,https://www.reddit.com/r/HpyloriNaturally/comments/1lae8s4/negative_after_own_treatment_3_days_of/,Negative after own treatment! (3 days of antibiotics & then food supplements),"Hello everyone, a brief history of my suffering: I am 31 years old, from Germany and have had extreme problems with my stomach for almost 8 years now. A few months ago, a gastroscopy revealed Helicobacter, which I had already suspected. Fortunately, no ulcers were found. Only a high infestation and the resulting gastritis and inflammation.

My symptoms included Constant heartburn, sudden intolerances (egg and chicken was very bad), nausea almost every evening, acid regurgitation (which also woke you up at night), sudden panic attacks and anxiety (e.g. in restaurants or in large crowds) and about 2-3x a year extreme stomach cramps with cold sweats.

Shortly afterwards, of course, I was prescribed Pylera, which I was really afraid of as I had read so many negative things. I was supposed to take it for 10 days. So I came up with the following plan, which I would like to share with you today to perhaps encourage others to do the same.

**The simple plan was as follows:**

**- I was going to take the Pylera, but only to a point until the side effects became too severe.**  
**- Then I wanted to continue directly with natural remedies**

So now I was at war with this bastard and prepared myself accordingly. I withdrew during this time and postponed all appointments (not so easy as a self-employed person).

I struggled a lot with the Pylera right from the start. But basically it was exactly the same symptoms I had for 8 years anyway, so I was fine with it. By day 3 I had terrible diarrhea, neck pain and muscle twitching. But I bravely endured this day too. On the morning of the fourth day, however, I also started bleeding in my stool and extreme dizziness (as if I had drunk 2 bottles of vodka), so I stopped the treatment as planned.

Now I continued daily with the following medication and food supplements:

**In the morning:** on an empty stomach I took **Anti-Pylori**. A medication with Pylopass for the natural elimination of Helicobacter.

**Lunchtime:** I chewed **mastic gum** before the meal and waited about 30 minutes afterwards. At mealtime I took 1 capsule of enriched **oregano oil**.

**Afternoon:** Probiotics from Omni (available here in every pharmacy)

**Evening:** Shortly before dinner, I took 1 **Anti-Pylori** again.

**2 hours before sleep:** A portion of **yoghurt** with oat flakes. Then nothing more to eat until bedtime so that the stomach can rest during the night.

**In between:** I regularly made myself a shot of **cranberry juice** and **turmeric**. We also had 1 jar of **Manuka honey** at home, which I also spooned up over the weeks. I always took half a teaspoon in the morning, at lunchtime, in the afternoon and in the evening.

To give my stomach the best possible support, I avoided coffee, as this always caused me particular problems. I also tried to eat more often and never eat enough. What counts with gastritis: nothing greasy, not too much and lots of raw food if possible. And yes, even raw food can help you with Helicobacter, as it starves the filthy beast. I have now tested negative twice, and I am really happy about it. I still have a little heartburn or discomfort here and there, but that's probably just because the fight isn't over yet. Because now my body has to heal.

It's difficult to say what has defeated it now. Maybe 3 days of antibiotics were enough? It's possible, but it can definitely be fought with natural things if you know who your enemy is. Stay strong, my friends!

I would be happy to answer your open questions, and simply want to encourage others not to give up. You can simply forget about conventional medicine in the meantime. Trust me when I tell you that you are now better doctors yourselves. Especially in Germany. Because here they only want to make money from patients.",1,1749816417.0,HpyloriNaturally,3,1.0,False

I was in line to get a coffee, and apparently, this kitty hitchhiked in the engine bay of the truck behind me. One of the employees captured it, and I brought it home with me.

  
My problem is, I already have a cat! And I have never had to introduce cats before. So far, resident kitty seems more curious than aggressive. When I brought the meowing box in, she was sniffing it and desperate to get inside—no negative body language or hissing.

Now, I have the kitten set up in the bathtub with a litter box, some wet food, and some water. My resident cat scratches at the bathroom door nonstop, desperate to get in there. I don't plan on introducing them until the kitten is medically cleared at the very least.

  
To get them acclimated to each other, I left the box I used to transport the kitten open for my resident cat to sniff, and I put a cat carrier with used bedding in the bathtub with the new kitten. Since doing that, the kitten has gone from incessantly meowing to seemingly much calmer and quieter.

  
So, should I introduce them sooner rather than later? Or should I do it extremely slowly, as most people recommend? I'm just wondering because I feel like the kitten would adjust and feel safer faster if it had a grown-up kitty to care for it. I believe it is around seven weeks old, so I know it \*should\* still be with mama, but there was just no way the guy behind me could take a kitten to work with him all day, then on the hour commute back home.

I have jumped in feet first to Lily Nichols's resources, among others, and one of the things I read somewhere is that having coffee on an empty stomach can spike your blood sugar when you have GD (even though coffee normally has a pretty minimal impact). (Caveat - I have not yet gotten my glucose monitor from insurance so not sure how any of this is actually affecting me.) 

I am the world's biggest culprit of having coffee on an empty stomach immediately upon waking up (and with a dash of creamer at that...) and then waiting a few hours until midmorning to eat breakfast because I am generally not hungry right when I first wake up. But it seems like that is a practice I'll definitely have to stop. Since I am conditioned to need coffee ASAP, looks like I'll need to start incorporating an earlier breakfast or snack.

1ladvd5,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1ladvd5/why_most_saas_companies_are_getting_ai_support/,Why Most SaaS Companies Are Getting AI Support Wrong (And How to Fix It),"I've been having a lot of coffee chats lately with Customer Success leaders from SaaS companies. More than 30 conversations, and they all circle back to the same frustration: AI support just isn't working for them.

""Our customers hated it,"" they tell me. ""Nothing beats human touch.""

And you know what? They're right – if AI support is poorly implemented. But they're missing some incredibly powerful use cases.

**The ""Google Moment"" That Changed Everything**

Picture this: I'm trying to reschedule an email campaign in a SaaS tool. Should be simple, right? Wrong.

After 2 minutes of clicking around, I contact support. Their response? ""One of our agents will get back to you within 1 business day.""

*One business day?* For a scheduling question?

So I opened Google, found their help article in 30 seconds, and solved it myself.

That's exactly where AI support should shine. An AI assistant right in their app, trained on their docs, could have given me that answer instantly.

**The Three Sweet Spots Where AI Actually Works**

**1. Onboarding & Quick Questions**

Your users don't want to hunt through help centers. They want instant answers while they're exploring your product. An embedded AI assistant is like having a knowledgeable friend ready to help without any friction.

**2. Structured Troubleshooting**

Instead of the dreaded back-and-forth (""Can you send a screenshot?"" ""What browser?"" ""Try clearing cache?""), AI can walk users through troubleshooting flows, collect all necessary info upfront, and either solve it or hand a complete case to human agents.

**3. Routine Tasks**

Processing refunds, extending trials, checking account limits – this stuff doesn't need human creativity. Most customers actually prefer instant, accurate answers to waiting for a friendly human agent.

**The ChatGPT Problem You Didn't Know You Had**

Your customers are already using AI for answers about your product – they're just not using *your* AI. They're asking ChatGPT, and when they get wrong information, they blame your product for being ""confusing.""

By implementing your own AI agent trained on your current docs, you take back control of that narrative.

**How to Do This Right?**

Two approaches that actually work:

**- Separate Channels:** Clear AI path for quick answers, separate human path for complex issues. Make it obvious which is which.

**- Integrated Hybrid:** AI built into your existing support, but transparent about it. Make escalating to humans ridiculously easy.

**The Bottom Line**

AI isn't here to replace your customer success team. It's here to free them up for moments where human connection actually matters.

At [Ordemio](https://www.ordemio.com), we help SaaS and Tech companies implement AI support the right way – not as a replacement, but as a tool that makes everyone's experience better.

Firstly, this sub was incredibly paramount in getting me through. Reading shared experiences, getting help from others who are ahead in their journey, understanding what to expect, and to just have people who will support you was huge- so thank you! 

Background: 

I was a tin a day for about 4.5 years. I quit on a whim last Thursday night really out of no where, if you’d ask me if I was planning to quit that morning I would have told you no. I’d never attempted a quit prior to this one. My motivator was damage I was doing to my mouth/gums and upcoming dental work I’d been pushing off. 

Days 1-3: 

First day was really rough rough for me- the normal stuff like being out of it, headache, cravings, irritable, was manageable but then at about 24 hour mark I unexpectedly had the first panic attack I’ve had in new years. After that I felt sick- cold shakes, sweating, etc. 2nd day and 3rd days were similar but much less bad. High anxiety was personally my biggest challenge, but thankfully I’ve been able to prevent it spiraling into another panic attack after day 1. 

Days 3-5: 

I do think one thing has made my journey a bit easier on the front end which is as mentioned earlier, I’d been putting off some dental work. So the day I quit I also called the dentist and scheduled that work which I had done on day 4. I think this definitely helped me on the Zyn quitting side for a couple days because I was in pain haha.  Morale of the story, get a tooth pulled even if you don’t need it, it will help out for a couple days. 


Days 5-7:

More recently, I’d say my nicotine cravings are increasing which is strange. Perhaps not physical but I’m realizing I used it to make the boring parts of the day more “fun”. Most difficult parts of the day for me now are right after my morning coffee, and then during parts of the work day. I generally just feel a bit more bored/ high strong at work. I definitely had an oral fixation so I’ve been chewing gum like no one’s business. 

Now to the parts I’m excited to share- the positives. These are the reasons YOU should quit and why I should STAY quit. There are so,so many things that I had no idea were an issue caused by Zyn until this last week. 


Positive takeaways/changes I’ve experienced:

- I’m no longer feeling numb. I didn’t realize this was the nicotine ( I’ve been using it for so long). But I had observed over the last couple years that I was losing interest in the things that used to make me feel happy/excited. I thought this was just due to aging. Now I can do something small like go on a walk and take in some nature and feel a rush dopamine.  A month ago I wouldn’t have felt that from something so small like a walk. It’s made life feel more beautiful, id forgotten the beauty in small parts of the day. 

- I’m so much less lazy. This one was really pissing me off about myself, once again I thought it was aging. But my mornings were slow after I popped a couple nicotine in. During the day I didn’t feel Ike getting up and doing much, just wanted to put my Zyn in and sit around. Now I find myself up and doing things instead of rotting on the couch in a nicotine coma. I’m seeking that dopamine from other activities/ accomplishments and I’ve already seen myself become so much more productive

- My sleep schedule/energy levels. This one’s huge and truly had no idea this one would change. But I’m going to bed earlier, waking up earlier, and more importantly I’m springing right out of bed. Where before, I’d need to drink my coffee, pop in a few Zyn, and sit down for 1-2 hours before I was ready to go for the day. 


I know there are more challenges ahead over the coming weeks and months. Others have said this in their posts, but I think the biggest challenge for me will be continuing to make myself “hate” Zyn to prevent myself from going back- I need to find them disgusting. Because there are moments I miss zyn and how it made me feel. Anyways thank you all for the support!

Shares of MP Materials Corp. (MP) jumped 8.5% in aftermarket trading on Thursday, building on a nearly 14% gain during the regular session, on news that the U.S. is weighing new measures to strengthen its rare earth minerals supply chain.

According to a Bloomberg report, U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration is looking to implement Cold War era measures to raise funding for rare earth minerals projects

Officials are reportedly considering using the Defense Production Act to unlock funding, loans, and other support for rare earth-related projects, from mining and processing to downstream technologies, in a move to develop a robust supply chain.

The discussion on rare earth minerals has been central to the trade war between the U.S. and China. In response to President Donald Trump’s broader tariffs on goods, Chinese President Xi Jinping suspended exports of a broad range of rare earths and related magnets in April.

The decision disrupted global supply chains vital to automakers, aerospace firms, semiconductor makers, and military contractors. 

However, earlier this week, Trump announced that China has agreed to resume supplying “full magnets and any necessary rare earths” following trade discussions between the two countries in London.

Last week, Morgan Stanley upgraded MP Materials stock rating to ‘Overweight’ from ‘Equal Weight’ while increasing the price target to $34 from $23. The ratings change sent MP shares up 5.5%.

The brokerage firm lauded MP Materials’ focus on managing the critical rare earth minerals supply chain, believing that it is the most vertically integrated rare earth metals company ex-China.

Retail sentiment toward the MP Materials stock among Stocktwits users remained ‘extremely bullish’, accompanied by ‘extremely high’ message volumes.

One user posted that the stock could soon rise to $100.

Year-to-date, MP Materials stock has gained over 87%.

# JUNE 12th 2025~ OPINION: China, Critical Minerals, and the Competitive Edge

[(22) China, Critical Minerals, and the Competitive Edge | LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/china-critical-minerals-competitive-edge-amanda-van-dyke-2dhne/)

https://preview.redd.it/zxst4ecjlo6f1.png?width=976&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c54f621331a504867ba6980e32a9e33440ba4cd

**Critical Minerals: Strategy, Not Sabotage**

The Chinese do not see critical minerals as a weapon—they see them as a **competitive advantage** and a **bargaining chip**. Contrary to popular geopolitical narratives, the intent was never to wield metals as a tool of coercion. Over the past 25 years, China has invested **hundreds of billions of dollars** into both **domestic** and **foreign mining ventures**, spanning the full spectrum of minerals—from iron ore to rare earth elements.

Equally important, China also invested heavily in **downstream processing and refining**, building a vertically integrated **minerals-to-manufacturing ecosystem** worth trillions. The result: effective control over large swaths of the world’s mineral supply, especially critical minerals essential to high-tech production.

**From Raw Materials to Industrial Dominance**

This wasn’t part of some “Dr. Evil” plan for global metals domination. It was, quite simply, **pragmatic industrial strategy**. China wanted to become a **high-tech manufacturing powerhouse**, and securing raw materials was a logical and necessary step toward that goal.

Mining and refining are traditionally **capital-intensive**, **low-margin**, and often **environmentally hazardous** industries—precisely the kind the West has systematically outsourced or abandoned. Nobody in the developed world wants a coal mine or a steel plant in their backyard. Yet, without these raw materials, there would be no iPhones, no EVs, and no infrastructure.

China did the opposite. It **embraced mining and refining**, invested in automation and scale, and developed expertise. It also **bypassed or relaxed environmental standards** that became barriers elsewhere. As a result, China became not just competitive—but **dominant**. Margins in mining are often razor-thin, so efficiency matters. China found ways to **extract more value** through strategic financing—of mining, refining, logistics, and trading—and built **supply chains that all point back to China**.

**The Power of Oversupply**

One of China’s most effective strategies has been to **slightly oversupply markets**, especially in base and minor metals. This served two purposes:

1. **Kept input prices low** for its own high-margin manufacturing industries.
2. **Deterred global competition** by making it unprofitable for others to enter or scale up production.

This pricing strategy has underpinned China’s dominance across industries—from toasters to **supercomputers**—by ensuring cheap, secure access to inputs that others struggle to obtain at scale or cost.

**The Critical Minerals Bottleneck**

The strategy worked—until **demand for critical minerals outpaced supply**, even for China. Materials like **gallium, silicon, germanium, rare earths, and antimony** have all seen explosive demand growth due to surging **EV** and **solar panel** production. These minerals are not only essential but often **non-substitutable** in high-tech components.

Take **antimony**, for example. It plays a critical role in enhancing **solar panel efficiency and thermal stability**, but global production is falling. China's **export restrictions on antimony**, imposed in 2023, were not primarily aimed at punishing the U.S., but rather to **prioritize domestic manufacturers**. These restrictions gave Chinese solar producers a decisive edge, avoiding supply disruptions that crippled competitors elsewhere.

This was not geopolitics—it was **industrial pragmatism**.

**The West’s Wake-Up Call**

The West began to grasp the strategic importance of critical minerals **around 2018–2020**, realizing that **lack of secure access** posed a threat not only to economic competitiveness but also to **national security**. However, mining and refining projects take **10–20 years** to develop and bring online.

That kind of long-term, infrastructure-heavy planning is something the West has **neglected in recent decades**. Although renewed investment is now underway, it will take **at least another 5–15 years** for the U.S. and its allies to catch up in most minerals.

**A Bargaining Chip, Not a Bludgeon**

For now, **China’s dominance** in mining and refining remains a **critical advantage** in manufacturing fields like **EVs**, **solar panels**, and **permanent magnets**. But it is also a **strategic lever** in trade negotiations.

A recent example: during trade talks with the U.S., China sought greater **access to American universities and markets**—worth **hundreds of billions** to its economy. In return, China offered a **small surplus of rare earth elements**, which it had been stockpiling. In dollar terms, the concession was worth **under $10 billion**—a tiny price for enormous gains elsewhere.

It was, by all measures, a **highly effective deal**.

**Conclusion**

China’s dominance in critical minerals is not the result of coercion, but of **long-term vision, industrial discipline, and strategic investment**. While the West is now playing catch-up, the reality is that China has spent decades building a system where **metals fuel manufacturing**, and **supply chains ensure leverage**.

In this race, critical minerals are not a weapon. They’re the **foundation of economic power**—and China built its fortress first

PORTO - twas a vibe. Loved roaming the hillside alleys for a great place to eat or grab a coffee. Chill atmosphere typical of many cities by the water; enjoyed it more the further I got away from the riverside hubbub. That said, there were a lot of British stag/hen groups (are those the right terms?) that gave it a big party atmosphere at night. Was offered cocaine by a Polish dude.

DOURO VALLEY - time truly stands still here. Older-skewing. Spent most of my time sipping wine by the pool, enjoying the lush views. 

LISBON - enjoyed a day trip to Sintra, not necessarily the palace itself but the hike to and fro. Grabbed a wonderful lunch in town on the way down at a charming family restaurant. 

Onto the city itself, was not impressed by the Caido/Baixa area, which felt overrun by tourists. These were the zones that came recommended and I was disappointed by the Disneyland feel of it all. However, I wonder if I would enjoy it more if I were with friends; will have to shoot for that next time. 

Principe Real was by far my favored area. Wonderful boutiques, chill atmosphere, great views. Palmeiral, with their lovely terrace and solid eats, is my recommendation here.

Overall, I had such a great time. I found the Portuguese to be direct and friendly; not a single bad interaction. Feeling very grateful to have been able to experience this wonderful country. Hope to be back soon.",1,1749814863.0,travel,6,0.67,False

This is my first post on Reddit although I lurk on Reddit daily. But the title is correct, I’m very blessed and have consistently been making $10k+ a month working strictly from home or a coffee shop, library, etc. 

Less than a year ago, I quit my job in Insurance and became an Apartment Locator in TX. It is required to have a Realtor license to Locate so I studied for the test for a couple weeks and got the license. 

I was originally going to do the traditional route and try to sell houses but after 2 meetings with 2 different brokerages, I wasn’t feeling either of the companies. I don’t know why I didn’t think of it in the moment but I remember when I moved to TX, I used an Apartment Locator. 

I texted him and we eventually met up to discuss what it actually means to Locate. It sounded like something up my alley and I decided to join his brokerage which was Apartment Locating specific. 

•

After trial and error, becoming more efficient, and finding better processes that I found that work. I scaled quite quickly to $10k+ a month. I’m very consistently making $2-3k a week without doing that amount of moneys worth of work, if that makes sense. The money is nice, I work from home 100% of the time, it’s practically part time or whatever you want it to be, I have no boss so that’s cool, and nobody is telling me I need to be anywhere at any time or anything. 

It’s fairly easy. All I do is communicate with my client through text (I only really call if they call me first but it’s rare since everyone likes to text.) I have a couple criteria questions that I ask them, then I go in my software and formulate a list of properties with availability that fit their criteria. Our software is a third party software that is meant for Locators and has a bunch of search functions so if there’s clients with specific needs then it’s easy to filter out apartments. 

I compile the list of usually 8-12 properties. Text it back over to them then they tell me if they want to tour any of the properties. Either they schedule the tours or I go on the apartments websites and schedule them. The client goes and tours the property. If they decide that’s the one and they out in an application and write that a Locator referred them to the property. 

The average commission is generally 100% of 1 month’s rent. This is the industry standard but it can range from a set amount like $200 or go up to 200% of 1 months rent. On average, my checks are always around $900-1200 but I’ve had big fish clients that I made $2-4k off of closing. 

The hardest part is getting leads and I’ve done quite well at that by learning the algorithm and have a process to collect leads. Now I get more leads then I can even handle, so that’s a good problem to have 😅

It’s a very simple process that can be automated in many ways. For the amount of work, it definitely pays well. Especially compared to my previous experience in retail, food industry, insurance, delivering, etc. Apartment Locating blows the amount of pay in those lines of work, out of the water. 

• 

Hopefully this helps someone out! I know this is kinda of an unknown niche or industry. There’s plenty of renters to go around and there aren’t very many Apt Locators. There’s a bunch of money to be made and practically anyone can do it. The hardest part is getting the license and it’s unbelievably easy (my insurance test was harder.) 

But if anyone had questions, I’m happy to help in the comments or if Reddit has a messaging option! 🙂 

Edit: I didn’t clarify, the apartment complex pays me for filling one of their vacancies. There is literally zero cost to the client for working with a Locator! ",1,1749814850.0,WFHJobs,0,1.0,False

The wedding reached the ring exchange part, the screen suddenly displayed a high-definition video of me being kidnapped, beaten, and sexually violated.

My fiancé,Kieran Stark called off the wedding on the spot,immediately slipped the ring onto my best friend Athena's finger instead.

I fell from the red carpet amid the friends' curses and humiliation.

One of Athena's mafia boss friend,Declan Royce,caught me, had his security team silence the entire room with his command, and even bring in ten cases of cash, proposing to me in front of everyone.

Moved by his action, I said yes.

Three years later, the IVF finally succeeded. I was rushing to share the wonderful news with him when I overheard his conversation with his friends.

""Hey,bro, you're fucking brilliant!Releasing that video of Talia being kidnapped and sexually assaulted at the wedding was the only way Miss Athena could marry into the Stark family.""

Declan spun his lighter and said, ""A prestigious family like the Starks would never marry a woman who's been... used. Only after Talia was completely ruined could Athena rightfully become Mrs. Stark.""

His friend asked, confused, ""But Miss Athena has already married into the Stark family. Why the hell did you bother marrying this... slut woman?""

""Athena's afraid of pain. Perfect to use Talia's womb to give her a child. Once she delivers the Stark heir, Athena's position in the family will be solid.""

The waves of laughter from the private room made my blood run cold.

All those moments I thought were happiness—they were just part of Declan's elaborate con to squeeze every last drop of value from me.

All so Athena could climb to the top by stepping on my body.

Wiping away my tears, I dialed his rival's number""I've got a ten-billion-dollar deal. You interested?""

The mocking voices in the room continued.

""Damn, Declan, you're a genius. Switching that woman's vitamins with abortion pills—when she couldn't conceive naturally, she had to do IVF. If she knew that you'd already swapped out the embryo with Miss Athena and Kieran's kid... oh, she'd probably fuming.""

""What’s it to me? After she gives birth, I'll just make up some excuse about the baby dying. She'll think it's her own fault for not being able to keep the child. Being able to pave the way for Athena's happiness... that's her honor.""

Throwing his lighter onto the table, he stood up and warned everyone present, ""Not a single word of today's conversation leaves this room. I need her to deliver this baby without any trouble.""

Milo slapped his chest, laughing, ""Boss, don't worry. That woman's dumb as shit. We call her 'sister-in-law' and she actually thinks she's the lady of the house. Every day she brings us food and drinks... she has no clue that I personally handpicked every single guy who was in that video.""

Someone burst out laughing, ""Milo, you're such a bastard!Why didn't you pick me back then? I would've loved to have a taste of—""

A fruit knife suddenly flew across the room, embedding itself in the floor right between the man's legs.

The joker's face went pale with terror.

""Did I or did I not say that Talia is my fucking wife now? Anyone who dares bring up that shit again, I'll fucking kill them.""

One of his men sheepishly said, ""Boss, seems like you actually do care about her a bit. And that woman loves you so much... aren't you worried that someday she'll find out the truth and leave you?""

Declan scoffed dismissively, ""Worst case scenario, I'll just get her pregnant with another test tube baby and keep her for the rest life. She's just a foolish woman—give her a few sweet words and she'll come crawling back like a fucking dog.""

The private room erupted in laughter again. I stood at the door, feeling like I'd been struck by lightning.

I could only cover my mouth tightly.

Footsteps approached the door. I quickly turned and ran downstairs, poured myself a glass of wine, and downed it in one gulp.

The burning sensation shot straight to my head, and tears finally broke free.

I clutched my chest as those soul-crushing words echoed over and over in my mind.

A week before the wedding, I was suddenly kidnapped and endured a day and night that even like hell.

My fiancé Kieran held my hand tenderly, saying he loved me and still wanted to marry me.

But the wedding I'd been so excited for turned into a nightmare when that video of my assault played for everyone to see.

Kieran's abandonment turned me into a whore scorned by thousands.

It was Declan who burst in, smashed the giant screen, held me in his arms, and viciously drove back everyone's shame and curses.

He had people bring in ten cases of cash for me, saying he'd fallen in love with me long ago, and if he couldn't marry me in this lifetime, he'd never release.

It was his determined gaze that conquered me. Now he was telling me that everything he did was just to pave the way for Athena.

No wonder Athena looked at me with that strange smile on the wedding day.

I was kidnapped because Athena said her car broke down and asked me to pick her up.

She knew all along that all this was just a scheme Declan had set up for her.

She was laughing at my stupidity, even more pleased to have such a devoted backup ready to do anything for her.

And these three years of care and affection were just fake emotions Declan put on to squeeze every last drop of value from me.

Yet I mistook the damn demon for my savior. How fucking ridiculous!

My fingernails dug into my flesh as I gritted my teeth. Pain and hatred churned in my chest, and the tears just wouldn't stop.

A familiar scent drifted down from above.

Declan tenderly kissed the corners of my eyes, but his brow furrowed deeply as he cursed loudly for everyone to hear, ""Which bastard made my wife cry? I'll fucking kill him!""

The entire hall fell silent. Everyone was too terrified to even breathe.

Declan pulled out his gun and pressed it into my hands, wrapping his arms around me and guiding my grip as he swept it across everyone present, ""Baby, see anyone you don't like? Just shoot them. I'm got your back.""

Everyone he aimed at shook like leaves, but none dared to dodge.

In LA, Declan was the boss of one of the two biggest families. No one could afford to cross him.

When the gun stopped on Milo, I paused.

Milo's eyes went wide, his face white with terror.

That phrase 'I personally handpicked every single guy who was in that video' kept screaming in my ears like a curse.

My chest heaved violently. Just as I was about to pull the trigger with red eyes, the gun barrel was pushed down.

Chapter 2

""Honey, the doctor said your IVF was successful. Better not see blood right now—wouldn't want to scare the baby.""

He coaxed me gently, the concern in his eyes looking completely genuine.I almost couldn't help but applaud his fucking Oscar-worthy performance.

Noticing something was off with my mood, Declan spotted the drink glass in front of me and asked, squeezing my palm, ""Babe, how long have you been here? Why didn't you come upstairs to find me?""

There was careful probing hidden in his words.

I looked down and said flatly, ""You guys were talking business upstairs—with cigar and wine. I don't like that.""

He sighed in relief and patted my head, having a maid bring over some coffee.

Just as the maid handed over the coffee, he suddenly grabbed his gun and shoot at her head.

I didn't even have time to react. Thick blood splattered across my face as the maid's outstretched hand froze mid-gesture before she collapsed, eyes wide with shock.

My lips trembled as my stomach clenched uncontrollably.

Declan acted like nothing happened, setting down the gun and carefully wiping my face clean with his sleeve before feeding me the sobering coffee sip by sip.

I swallowed mechanically, my whole body shaking.

In my peripheral vision, Milo had someone drag the maid's body away.

A winding trail of blood stretched across the floor.

""Can't even take care of my wife properly—letting her drink is harming my son. No reason for her to keep breathing.""

I looked at his cold, vicious expression as my stomach churned violently.

Declan tenderly touched my face, ""It's all my fault for making you suffer so much. Now that we finally have a baby, no more alcohol, okay?""

""This child has to be born healthy no matter what, understand?""

I took several deep breaths before forcing out a dry smile, ""Okay.""

But my heart felt frozen with fear.

In three years of marriage, I'd been pregnant six times. Each time, I miscarried for no apparent reason.

After so many losses, it became habitual miscarriage.

Six months ago, the doctor declared I could never conceive again.

Declan held me lovingly, saying he didn't care about children—as long as I was happy and healthy.

I'd been tormented by guilt over not being able to give him a healthy child. After extensive research, I chose the difficult path of IVF.

My belly was riddled with needle holes, hormone pills taken by the handful.

All that suffering, and it was all just to benefit Athena.

Just because she was afraid of pain, I had to permanently lose my chance at motherhood and become nothing but a breeding machine.

""What's wrong? You look terrible. Are you feeling sick? I'll get a doctor here right away.""

""I'm fine, just a bit of morning sickness.""

Declan's eyes reddened with concern as he gently caressed my face, ""Honey, you're so tired. I wish I could bear this for you. We rushed into marriage back then—I've ordered your favorite imported wedding dress. Before you start showing, let's go try it on tomorrow.""

I stared at him steadily. Such loving eyes, treating me like a fool, lying to me again and again.

If he knew I had no intention of carrying this baby to term, I'd probably end up just like that maid.

I forced a smile, ""I'm going to rest. You guys keep talking.""

As soon as I got back to the room, I couldn't help but rush to the bathroom and vomit until my stomach twisted into knots.

Tears streamed down my face. The physical pain was nothing compared to even a fraction of the heartbreak.

After recovering for a while, I finally got up and came out, only to see Declan's phone left on the sofa.

As if possessed, I picked it up and tried Athena's birthday as the passcode. It unlocked on the first try.

The wallpaper was a photo of Athena leaning against his shoulder with a radiant smile.

I scrolled through the photo album.

Over five thousand photos, every single one featuring Athena.

He'd used four folders to save them, documenting different periods of Athena's life. Each word was labeled with just one character that together spelled out ""love.""

In their chat history, Declan had once risked his life to steal a queen's crown from Country A overnight.

I suddenly remembered that day—he came back with two bullet wounds, nearly didn't make it. I had to trade my mother's only keepsake, a priceless diamond, to get him back from the royal family.

All because Athena mentioned wanting to feel like a queen at her 25th birthday party.

Tears fell onto the screen as my heart felt like it was being carved up.

Not from the pain of years of deception, but because for such a demon who destroyed me, I'd even sacrificed the only item my mother left me.

Through blurred vision, my eyes fell on the crescent-shaped birthmark on Athena's right shoulder, and I gasped in shock.

I had an identical birthmark in the exact same spot on my right shoulder.

I remembered when I first met Athena, she didn't have this birthmark.

Ever since I told her about saving a blood-covered man when I worked as a Doctors Without Borders volunteer in Tilan Country, she started distancing herself from me.

Not long after, she became Declan's sister, and Declan had also said that Athena had saved his life.

But Athena was a coward who feared death. Tilan Country, a war-torn nation—she'd never even been there, always bad-mouthing and looking down on it.

My fingers curled coldly as an absurd suspicion gradually took shape in my mind.

So that's how it is!

I collapsed to the floor, crying and laughing at the same time.

Chapter 3

After a long while, I wiped away my tears, composed myself, and find an unfamiliar phone number.

""I've got a ten-billion-dollar deal. You interested?""

""What kind of business?""

""Kidnap me in three days.""

I gently touched my belly, ""Declan will pay this ransom willingly.""

Just as I hung up, Declan pushed the door open.

He'd been drinking heavily, stumbling slightly as he walked, but his vigilance was sharp as ever as he grabbed my hand, ""What am I supposedly paying for willingly?""

I answered without blinking, ""I saw a beactiful necklace. They said I need to pay for first.""

He smiled and rested his head on my shoulder, ""Fine, I'll pay, I'll pay for everything. Athena, whatever you want, I will give you. I'm yours too.""

I kept my expression blank as I helped him to bed and tucked him in, then lay beside him with my eyes open all night.

The next day, halfway to the bridal shop, Declan took a call and frantically explained to me, ""Honey,I need to go handle some toubles right now.""

He gripped my hand apologetically, ""I'm sorry. Tomorrow I'll definitely come with you to try on the dress. I even ordered matching a rare rings—let's go try them together tomorrow, okay?""

I pulled my hand away, ""I understand. Go handle your business. I'll be good and wait for you at home.""

He squeezed my hand, and as soon as I got out of the car, he sped away.

Less than ten minutes later, Milo's car arrived.

As soon as I got in, a photo of Athena came through.

She wore a dazzling diamond ring and the imported wedding dress I'd chosen, kneeling on a man's lap.

A large hand rested on her pale thigh through the sheer fabric, lips kissing the crescent birthmark on her right shoulder, eyes dark with desire.

A message followed immediately.

""I can only make love with her at night with the lights off, imagining she's you.Athena, my sweet baby, your brother misses you so much. Make your brother feel good.""

The hoarse voice was followed by suppressed panting.

In the silent car, Milo's mocking laughter rang out.

I was shocked, suddenly realizing we weren't heading home.

""Milo, I'm Mrs.Royce! What the hell do you think you're doing?""

The car stopped abruptly. I immediately reached for the other door, but he was faster, grabbing my ankle and dragging me out of the car.

The pain made everything go black.

I glared at him through gritted teeth, ""I'm carrying Declan's baby. If anything happens to me, you won't survive either.""

""You stupid bitch, you don't really think Declan would let a dirty whore like you carry his child, do you?""

A shrill laugh came from behind me. Only then did I notice this street wasn't far from the bridal shop.

Athena stepped on my face, her eyes and expression full of gleeful satisfaction.

Milo walked over and wrapped his arms around her waist, groping her roughly. Under my shocked gaze, the two kissed passionately!

After a while, Milo spoke leisurely, ""You heard us at the door that day, didn't you? Too bad the embryo in your belly isn't Athena's either. I just grabbed some random bastard's spawn from the slums and swapped it out.""

I jerked my head up, pupils trembling with shock.

Athena laughed until she shook.

""Oh gosh, now you're dirty bitch inside and out! A bastard's baby, a whore mother.

Talia, what's the difference between you and a club hooker? At least they get paid a few bucks. You're not getting money to birth a bastard!""

""Is one enough? Should we stuff your belly more?""

My head was spinning, thick sweetness rushing to my throat.

I roared and grabbed a stone from the ground, wanting nothing more than to take these two down with me.

Milo kicked me in the stomach. I fell face-first, spitting up blood, my face pale with agony.

But just then, Athena suddenly stepped back in apparent terror, swaying before falling backward.

Even though she hadn't been hurt, Declan came running and stepped on my hand as he rushed to hold her, his eyes full of naked concern, ""Athena, how are you? Are you injuried?""",1,1749814636.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

Real Pros & Cons,"**🚀 _Curious about your digital nomad income potential? Diagnose it in under 90 seconds! [Try the free tool now.](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)_**

#### The Allure of the Nomadic Dream

The world whispers. Freedom. Adventure. A laptop, a passport, and a one-way ticket to anywhere. It’s the siren call that slices through the monotony of office life, promising something raw, untamed, and utterly yours. Forget the fluorescent prison of the cubicle—this is the jailbreak for the ambitious, the restless, the ones who refuse to settle for ordinary.

You crave more than a paycheck. You want autonomy. You want to rewrite the script. The nomadic dream isn’t just a fantasy—it’s a rebellion against the status quo.

**🌍 _Ready to see if you have what it takes? Uncover your digital nomad income potential now—free and fast! [Check it here.](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)_**

#### The Rise of the Digital Nomad Movement

It started as a fringe movement. A handful of outliers trading boardrooms for beach bars. But then the world shifted. Remote work exploded. Suddenly, the digital nomad wasn’t a unicorn—they were everywhere. Coffee shops became coworking hubs. Airports became offices. The nine-to-five? Irrelevant.

This isn’t a trend. It’s a tectonic shift. The old rules are obsolete. The new rules? Still being written.

#### Defining the Digital Nomad Lifestyle

Who gets to call themselves a digital nomad? Not every remote worker qualifies. A digital nomad is a mover, a perpetual traveler whose office is wherever Wi-Fi flows. They’re not just working from home—they’re working from anywhere. Mountains. Megacities. Tiny islands you can’t pronounce.

Remote worker? That’s a job description. Digital nomad? That’s a life philosophy.

#### The Financial Equation

Let’s talk money. The fantasy: earn dollars, spend pesos. The reality: income streams can be volatile. Freelancers, entrepreneurs, remote employees—everyone’s got a different hustle. Some rake in six figures. Others scrape by on ramen and optimism.

But watch out for the hidden costs. Flights. Visas. Travel insurance. That “cheap” destination? Inflation, scams, and the occasional lost passport can torch your budget in a heartbeat.

#### The Geography of Opportunity

Geoarbitrage: the digital nomad’s secret weapon. Earn in a strong currency, spend in a weaker one. Suddenly, Bali feels like Beverly Hills on a Boise budget. But it’s not just about cost of living. Some countries roll out the red carpet for nomads—think special visas, tax breaks, and thriving expat scenes.

Others? Bureaucratic nightmares. Know before you go.

#### The Tech Stack for Survival

Your gear is your lifeline. Laptop, phone, portable hotspot. Noise-canceling headphones for the hostel chaos. Cloud backups for when your hard drive meets an untimely end in a rainstorm. And don’t skimp on cybersecurity—public Wi-Fi is a hacker’s playground.

The right tech stack? It’s the difference between thriving and barely surviving.

#### The Social Fabric

Community matters. But how do you build lasting connections when your zip code changes monthly? Coworking spaces, meetups, online forums—they’re your lifelines. But loneliness lurks. The myth of perpetual connection is just that—a myth. Real relationships take work.

You’ll need to be proactive, vulnerable, and a little bit fearless.

#### Productivity in Paradise

Paradise is a double-edged sword. The beach is calling, but so is your deadline. Distractions multiply. Discipline is non-negotiable. You’ll need systems—routines that anchor you when everything else is in flux.

And time zones? They’ll mess with your head. Jet lag isn’t just physical—it’s professional.

#### Health and Wellbeing

Staying healthy on the road is a full-time job. Gyms come and go. Sleep schedules evaporate. Street food is delicious—until it isn’t. You’ll need strategies for fitness, nutrition, and mental health. Burnout is real. So is homesickness.

Self-care isn’t optional. It’s survival.

#### Legal Labyrinths

Visas. Work permits. The bureaucratic gauntlet is relentless. Overstay, and you’re toast. Underprepare, and you’re grounded. Insurance? Read the fine print—most policies don’t cover the nomadic lifestyle.

Legal blind spots can end your journey before it begins.

#### The Sustainability Question

Is this lifestyle sustainable—for you, for the planet? Endless flights rack up a carbon debt. Ethical nomadism means more than just Instagrammable sunsets. It’s about giving back, treading lightly, and respecting local cultures.

The world isn’t your playground. It’s your responsibility.

#### The Dark Side of Freedom

Freedom is intoxicating. But it comes with a hangover. Burnout. Decision fatigue. The pressure to perform—always hustling, always “on.” The line between work and life blurs until it disappears.

You’ll need boundaries. Otherwise, freedom becomes a cage.

#### Career Trajectory

Can you climb the ladder from a hammock? Maybe. But you’ll need to build a brand, not just a resume. You’re your own marketing department, HR, and tech support. The traditional career path? Irrelevant.

Your trajectory is what you make it.

#### Relationships on the Road

Love and friendship get complicated. Connections are intense but fleeting. Family feels far away. You’ll need to work twice as hard to maintain relationships. Homesickness is the price of admission.

But the upside? You’ll meet people who change your life.

#### Security and Safety

Personal safety is non-negotiable. New places, new risks. Trust your instincts. Digital security is just as critical—VPNs, encrypted messaging, and paranoia are your friends.

Stay alert. Stay safe.

#### The Learning Curve

Adaptability isn’t optional—it’s a survival skill. You’ll fail. You’ll pivot. You’ll win in ways you never expected. The learning curve is steep, but the view from the top? Unmatched.

#### The Myth vs. Reality

Instagram tells one story. Reality tells another. The sunsets are real, but so are the setbacks. The stories nobody tells—missed flights, lost clients, existential crises—are the ones that matter.

Don’t buy the hype. Write your own story.

#### The Exit Strategy

Not everyone stays nomadic forever. Burnout, family, new priorities—they all pull you home. Re-entry into “normal” society is jarring. But you’ll bring back skills, stories, and scars no one else has.

#### Who Should (and Shouldn’t) Go Nomad?

This life isn’t for everyone. It rewards the adaptable, the resilient, the fiercely independent. If you crave stability, routine, or a clear path, think twice. Red flags? Inflexibility, fear of uncertainty, aversion to risk.

Know yourself before you go.

#### Making the Decision: Is It Worth It?

Here’s the calculus. The risk is real. The reward? Freedom, growth, and a life less ordinary. Only you can decide if the trade-off is worth it. But if you’re reading this, you already know the answer.

Your next move? Only you can make it.",1,1749814531.0,NomadicLifestyleGlobe,0,1.0,False

Audrey squinted against the harsh light and gave a bitter little smile.

Everyone knew the story. She was an orphan girl from some no–name town who somehow married Clayton Patel, a big–shot lawyer with a spotless image. People all said she won the lottery.

But now, with a reputation for being violent and unstable, fired from her job and fresh out of a mental hospital, she looked even more out of place next to Clayton.

Audrey thought bitterly, ‘They all think I don’t deserve him. Funny thing is, the one who stuck me in that hellhole and slapped that label on me was my perfect husband himself!’

Audrey, a 23–year–old grown woman, had been locked in there for a month because her husband claimed she was a danger and needed to have her mind straightened out.

During the past month, she was punished, starved, locked in pitch–black isolation—until she cracked, until she agreed she was wrong and promised

to change.

Now, standing outside, breathing free air again, she watched Clayton hang up a call. His handsome face twisted with irritation.

“Zoe’s ran a bath for you. Let’s go home and wash off the bad luck,” Clayton said to Audrey.

Audrey dodged the hand he reached toward her shoulder.

Clayton was always well–groomed with tailored suits and expensive cologne. But today, he didn’t smell like his usual scent. Instead, he reeked of something sickly sweet, like overripe fruit. That scent made Audrey sick.

Ignoring Clayton’s grim face, Audrey pulled open the passenger–side door and got in.

Clayton watched her, his lips pressed tight. He thought she was clearly still sulking after a month of confinement. He figured she wasn’t used to that kind of strict environment, so she threw a tantrum.

Though he had his reasons, he still went too far to send her in against her will. So, for now, he didn’t blame her for her little temper.

He sat in the back seat. The driver closed the door and started the car.

Audrey turned to the window and closed her eyes. The whole thing a month ago appeared in her mind.

8:50 pm DDD.

Chapter 1

It was her birthday that day. Clayton brought home a special guest–his childhood friend, Valerie Patterson, and her three–year–old daughter,

Luna Patterson.

While Clayton went to get the cake, Valerie grabbed a fruit knife and pressed it to her wrist, threatening to hurt herself if Audrey didn’t give Clayton back to her.

Tears streamed down Valerie’s face as she said she and Clayton were meant to be, that she came back to fix what they once lost.

Audrey lunged to stop Valerie and tried to snatch the knife just as Clayton walked in.

Valerie stumbled into Clayton’s arms, sobbing like she’d just survived a war. “Audrey, please don’t hurt Luna. Clayton and I haven’t done anything. You’re getting it all wrong.”

Audrey stood frozen with the knife still in hand, her mind blanking out.

Valerie, still clinging to Clayton, glanced up at Audrey with a smug glint in her eyes. “Clayton only let us move into your house ‘cause we had nowhere else to go.

“I swear I’ll pay back every penny he lent to us. Just don’t scare my baby, okay? She’s got autism.”

Clayton wrapped his arms around Valerie and Luna and shot a cold stare at Audrey. “Valerie’s hands are for painting. How could you hurt her?”

Little Luna, who watched the whole thing, just curled up tighter in Clayton’s arms, shaking like a leaf.

Audrey let out a dry laugh, more from rage than amusement.

She thought to herself, ‘So that’s her game. She used my birthday party to air out her affair with Clayton. Either I suck it up and pretend my

Chapter 1

Audrey turned to Clayton, her voice firm. “Believe it or not, she cut

herself.”

“No way,” Clayton shot back without missing a beat.

He was convinced no one knew Valerie’s talent with a paintbrush better than he did. She would rather die than damage her hands. No chance she’d hurt herself just to frame Audrey.

Audrey scoffed and pointed straight at Valerie. “Then tell me, why did you let them live in the house I bought and even gave them money? You’re keeping her and her kid on the side, and I’m supposed to just be cool with it?**”** 

Clayton’s colleagues and a couple of his friends were right behind him. Being embarrassed like that in front of everyone clearly rattled him.

“My hand… Clayton, it hurts,” Valerie whimpered, holding out her bleeding wrist, swaying like she was about to faint.

Guilt flashed across Clayton’s face, but it was gone in a blink, replaced by anger. He barked at his assistant, “My wife has violent tendencies. Send her to Ashwood Mental Hospital.”

Thinking back on it, Audrey put on a cold smile, sneering, ‘To protect that woman’s reputation, my husband threw me into that filthy place!

Clayton must’ve caught that mocking look on her face, because for once, he tried to explain himself, “I sent you to Ashwood to keep things from getting worse. You scared Luna.

“She had a fever for days. They’ve had a hard time. You shouldn’t trash Valerie like that.”

Audrey opened her eyes, her gaze turning icy. “I picked the house. I pay the mortgage. They’re living in it and spending money from MY husband. Yeah, clearly I screwed up. I should’ve been more generous, huh?”

Clayton took a deep breath and said, “Vally doesn’t blame you, She’s already dropped the charges. It won’t affect you.”

Audrey sneered, thinking, ‘Won’t affect me? Due to my so–called violent tendencies you pinned on me, I lost my job three days after staying at Ashwood.‘

Clayton and Valerie went way back. Years ago, both Valerie and Clayton’s fathers got sick. Valerie’s father gave up his shot at treatment and donated his kidney to save Clayton’s father.

After that, Valerie and her mother moved out of town to live with her uncle. The night she turned up again, she was on the run. She was beaten by her husband, so she took her daughter to leave.

Clayton just happened to be on a business trip in that exact city. He swooped in like a hero, took on Valerie’s divorce case, and brought her and her daughter back to Ironhaven.

The car slowly rolled into Hightower Homes. Audrey didn’t wait for it to stop but opened the door, got out, and headed straight for the elevator without a glance back.

She took a long shower and changed into clean clothes.

When she came out, Zoe was carrying dishes from the kitchen. She said with a smile, “Dinner’s almost ready, ma’am. Mr. Patel picked all your favorites.”

Clayton was on the couch going through some documents. He looked up over the rim of his gold–rimmed glasses and said, “Dry your hair first. I’ll wait to eat with you.”

Anyone walking in might’ve thought he was the picture of a devoted husband, setting aside legal briefs to dine with his wife.

Chapter 1

But Audrey knew this was just his usual trick: slap you across the face and then hand you a candy.

Clayton took off his glasses and walked to the dining table. Pulling out a chair, he said, “It’s a bit late today. I’ll have *Zoe* buy your favorite fish

tomorrow.**”** 

Audrey sat down without a word and picked up her fork.

Clayton was good at keeping his emotions locked up and hardly ever spoke more than necessary. Most of the time when they were together, Audrey always babbled him with some online gossip just to fill the silence.

Each time, Audrey would laugh out loud, yet Clayton was just calm and would sometimes give her a look to remind her of being composed.

Now, Audrey didn’t even look at him. Worse, when he tried to serve her some food, she just picked it up and tossed it back onto the plate.

Chapter 2

Clayton tried to serve her more food, but Audrey stood up, dumped her utensils in the sink, and walked straight to the bedroom.

They had a nanny at home, but Audrey liked doing things herself. She used to cook Clayton’s favorite meals and laid out his suits for the day. Zoe came in for an hour daily just to tidy up.

She used to think it was a sweet little routine between them, yet now, recalling what happened, Audrey felt like she was out of her mind in the

past.

Clayton’s mother, Lillian Patel, always thought Audrey was after Clayton’s money. She made Clayton hand over half his paycheck every month for her to keep and said she’d return it when she was sure Audrey wasn’t a gold digger.

Their finances had basically been split fifty–fifty since the wedding. And outsiders still loved gossiping about how Audrey married up, about her being some clingy, fame–hungry wannabe.

Audrey put up with all of it because she loved Clayton. But now? Now she couldn’t believe how blind she used to be.

The husband she always felt proud of, the man who once stood for justice, fighting tooth and nail for unpaid factory workers, now threw his own wife under the bus to protect another woman’s reputation.

Clayton’s hand froze in the air, and he clearly felt the weight of her cold shoulder. He wiped his mouth with a napkin and knocked gently on the bedroom door. “Audrey, I can explain that thing.”

From inside, Audrey let out a bitter laugh and thought, ‘If you had anything to say, why didn’t you say it a month ago in front of your coworkers, your friends, and in front of her? What’s the act for now?‘

She remembered that look in his eyes that night was nothing but

irritation, and he said to her, “You can leave Ashwood once you calm

down.”

20

He even said, “Vally and Luna have had it rough. If you’re gonna make things worse for them, then maybe it’s time you felt what being truly alone is like.”

He knew she was an orphan, and he always knew he was her only lifeline. But instead of standing by her, he sided with Valerie and crushed what little hope she had left.

When Valerie watched Audrey being dragged into Ashwood, she didn’t even try to hide the satisfaction in her eyes. She smiled, as if saying, ‘Say what you want, Clayton won’t believe you. The more you fight it, the crazier you’ll look.’

Audrey tried to break free from the nurses and scrambled back toward the hallway. With just one door between them, she heard Valerie sweet–talking Clayton, “Clay, the doctor just said I can’t draw anymore, but I can still have other jobs. Audrey only hurt me ‘cause she loves you too much.”

Audrey didn’t hear what Clayton replied because she was already forced into a room with bars on the windows.

She’d clenched her teeth and thought, ‘If Clayton wants to play savior, he better chain himself to her for life. Just don’t drag decent people down with them. I’m not interested in his lame excuse!‘

Clearly thrown by Audrey’s sudden silence, Clayton loosened his tie, feeling irritated without knowing why. He raised his voice to say, “Why do you hate Vally so much? She’s just a friend.”

Audrey didn’t buy that for a second. She couldn’t believe he still pretended

not to know how Valerie felt for him.

After all, Valerie was jobless, divorced, and took her three–year–old daughter with autism back to Ironhaven and stepped into their life.

Chapter 2

Audrey sneered inwardly, ‘What kind of friend pushes others to divorce? What kind of friend throws herself into the arms of another woman’s

husband?‘

If things kept going like this, Audrey knew she’d finally go crazy one day.

She suddenly flung the bedroom door open and sneered, “Your family owes Valerie. That’s your business, not mine. You want me to take care of your parents, but now I’m supposed to repay your debt too?”

20

She thought bitterly, ‘Just because I married a superior and famous lawyer, I should play the good wife role? I didn’t get any benefit from this marriage but got hurt mentally and physically!’

She looked him straight in the eye and said firmly, “You were scared people would talk trash about her, so you told them I was violent and unstable. Her father saved your father, so you wanna sacrifice my reputation to protect her name?”

Her voice shook with rage. “What right does she have to live in the house I bought and spend the money my husband gives her? What right do you have to send me to that darned mental hospital?”

Audrey had been holding her rage all in for too long, and now the dam burst. She let all her rage and her heartbreak out.

She hated Valerie for twisting the truth, but even more than that, she hated the man who once promised her a warm and safe home. She took a shaky breath, wiped her face, and realized her cheeks were wet with tears.

Clayton’s expression turned more serious. He hadn’t expected her to be this furious. Lowering his voice, he said, “I know you lost your job, but I’ll support you. Once Vally and Luna settle down, I’ll hand over the rest of my paycheck to you.”

Audrey let out a long breath, feeling tired. She thought to herself, ‘If I fall for his crap again, I’m the dumbest woman ever. You betrayed me once,

3/6

8:50 pm DDD

Chapter 2

and what makes you think I’ll believe your promise again?‘

She’d seen through him completely. Clayton’s heart had already gone rotten. He’d always side with Valerie. This time, she was sent *to* Ashwood Mental Hospital. But she didn’t know if she had a fight with Valerie again, what her heartless husband would do to her.

After all, she had no family. Clayton, as her legal guardian, had the power to do whatever he wanted.

Audrey looked at Clayton. Her eyes contained no more softness, no love, just a sheet of coldness.

She said, “Don’t bother dangling carrots in front of me. I got fired due to Valerie. You’re gonna pay me 150,000 dollars. Then we get a divorce. You can play house with whoever you want after that.”

“I’m not divorcing you,” Clayton shot back without hesitation.

Yanking off his tie, he flung it onto the couch. His chest felt tight, like he couldn’t breathe. He thought, ‘She wants a divorce over something so small? What the hell is wrong with her?‘

The tie hit a decorative piece on the coffee table, knocking it to the floor. It shattered with a sharp crash, broken into pieces.

For once, the always–composed lawyer Clayton raised his voice. “You lost your job, and I’ll make it right. But divorce? Out of the question.”

He thought he’d already lowered himself enough. He was Clayton–the admired, respected, and untouchable top–tier lawyer. Now that he was trying to meet her halfway, Audrey should’ve known when to quit.

But Audrey’s eyes were colder than ever. There was even disgust in them.

Clayton suddenly felt something slipping out of his grasp. He couldn’t name it, but the feeling irritated him more than he cared to admit.

He muttered, “It’s all in the past. Can’t we let it go?”

Chapter 2

“Clay? Is Audrey back?” Valerie’s voice rang out as she walked in, decked out in a Chanel dress, a Coach bag on her arm, and a pair of shining high

heels.

**20** 

Valerie was five years older than Audrey, but she dressed younger and more fashionably. Audrey had always been practical–saving every cent to pay off the mortgage early, never splurging on luxury brands.

However, Valerie, a jobless single mother with a sick toddler, strolled in head–to–toe brands. It didn’t take a genius to figure out who was footing

the bill.

She stopped at the entryway, pretending to be shocked at the pieces on the floor. “Audrey, if you’ve got a problem, take it out on me. My hand’s ruined already. Go ahead and slash me again if it makes you feel better.

“That piece is a foreign art exhibit, you know? Clayton really likes it. It cost a few grand.”

Audrey let out a laugh that was anything but amused. “Valerie, with that kind of imagination, you seriously missed your calling. You should be stalking celebs for gossip sites. I bought that piece, okay? How this involves you?”

Before Valerie could get a word in, Audrey turned to Clayton. “You heard her, right? That thing’s a foreign exhibit, cost 6,000 dollars. You broke it. You gotta pay.”

Valerie’s eyes filled with tears instantly. She turned those helpless,

wounded eyes toward Clayton. “Clay, I thought you guys were arguing about me, so I—”

Clayton clenched his fists, feeling fed up. “Vally’s already forgiven you for what you did to her. You don’t need to keep pushing.”Chapter **3** 

Valerie gently touched Clayton’s arm and said, “Clay, it’s fine. I know Audrey hates me. I’ll just leave now.”

But she didn’t move a muscle. Instead, she looked up at Clayton with wide eyes, full of dependence and reluctance.

Clayton picked up the broken pieces and placed them on the coffee table. He was afraid Audrey might lose it again and end up hurting Valerie.

Clayton and Audrey got married just after they met each other. Back then, he was pissed at his family and randomly asked Audrey, who’d just dropped off a file at his law firm, if she’d marry him.

Audrey’s reaction was unforgettable. She was first shocked, then pure joy. She told him she was an orphan, just landed a job at a foreign company, and didn’t have much to offer compared to him. She promised she’d work hard, catch up to him, and be worthy.

Clayton made sure to sign a prenup, and the two of them got their marriage license without much fuss.

In the year since, Audrey worked her ass off at the office and at home. She arranged everything well, made his favorite meals, and never once complained.

Clayton could see how much she loved him in her eyes. He enjoyed being the center of her world. He believed she’d never actually leave him, and everything she said was just because she was angry.

Clayton said to Valerie, “Vally, can you go back for now?”

“Huh?” Valerie looked like she’d just been slapped.

Her eyes went wide in disbelief, and she thought, ‘Is Clayton seriously kicking me out for Audrey?‘

Chapter 3

“I need to talk to Audrey. I’ll come see you later,” he added, looking at her with a gentler gaze, like trying to soothe a sulking child.

“Alright, I’ll wait for you,” Valerie said, but her heels didn’t budge.

She turned to Audrey with a smile that barely masked her bitterness. “Audrey, Clayton and I have known each other since we were kids. If anything were going to happen between us, it would’ve happened a long time ago. Don’t you think?”

Just then, Zoe burst through the door, breathless. “Ms. Patterson, come here, Luna collapsed. Her face is blue. I didn’t dare move her.”

Valerie let out a sharp gasp and spun toward Clayton. “What should I do? She had an episode yesterday too. Clayton, I’m scared.”

Clayton didn’t hesitate. He turned around and went toward the living room. “Calm down. Let’s take her to the hospital right away.”

“Thank goodness you’re here,” Valerie said, sticking close to him. “Feel my hands. I’m freezing.“”

As Clayton grabbed his car keys, he suddenly thought of Audrey. His hand paused mid–air.

He turned back and looked at her, saying. “Vally is still new to Ironhaven. She doesn’t know the hospitals here. I’ll take Luna to see the doctor first.

Can we talk later?**”** 

Audrey stared back at him, her face blank. She didn’t give him any

response.

Clayton frowned, and Valerie instantly took his arm and said, “What if something happens to Luna? If she dies, I won’t want to live.”

Without another word, Clayton grabbed the keys and rushed out the door.

Valerie followed right behind him, but before stepping outside, she turned around and shot Audrey a smug little look–one that screamed, ‘See? You

lost again, Audrey. I’m the one Clayton cares about above all.

Audrey stood by the window and watched as Clayton carried Luna to the car, and Valerie slipped into the passenger seat. To any outsider, they’d look like a perfect family.

\+20

Audrey thought bitterly, ‘How ridiculous. Her own kid passed out. Instead of checking on her, that woman ran straight to Clayton.

‘What if he weren’t here? Would she watch her daughter die? Either Clayton’s too blind to see through this pathetic act or he enjoys playing

her hero.’

Zoe then left too, and the house finally went quiet. Audrey went back to the bedroom and started packing her things. She wasn’t going to keep tolerating this broken marriage–not for another day.

Clayton was a lawyer. If he refused to divorce, she’d have to sue him, and she knew she’d be at a disadvantage. But she wasn’t scared. It was hard, but it didn’t mean it was impossible.

Back when they got married on impulse, Clayton suggested they take a year to get to know each other before becoming a “real” couple. Audrey agreed, but on one condition–she’d buy her own house with her own

money.

Now, she felt relieved that she made that decision. At least she still left herself a way out.

Audrey took out her suitcase and started packing her clothes and documents. Then, she opened her jewelry box on the vanity. Inside was the diamond necklace Clayton bought her. The diamond wasn’t huge, but it cost over ten grand.

She’d barely worn it, afraid it looked too flashy. Now, all she could think was how stupid she’d been.

She never asked Clayton to stop giving money to his parents. During

3/6

8:51 pm

Chapter 3

holidays, she always paid out of her own pocket to buy his parents some gifts to avoid conflict.

She didn’t spend a dime of Clayton’s money, yet Valerie and her kid were living off Clayton just fine.

Audrey took a deep breath, opened a drawer, and grabbed the incident report and withdrawal form from Ashwood Mental Hospital, along with the clean bill of health the doctor gave her when she was discharged.

Then she hailed a cab and went straight to the apartment she bought herself–only to find the lock code had been changed.

Furious, she called the police. The police showed up with the building’s property manager in tow.

The manager looked nervous as hell and explained, “Mrs. Patel, Mr. Patel told us that woman and her daughter would move in.”

\+20

Audrey held up her property deed and declared, “I’m the legal owner here. No one can move in without my permission. That’s trespassing. Officer, I want the door opened under your supervision. If they damaged my place, I’m holding them and this property company accountable.”

The manager wiped the sweat from his forehead and called in a locksmith. When the door swung open, even the police and the manager looked stunned.

The house was originally done in minimalist style–white walls, light tiles, nothing fancy. Audrey didn’t have enough budget to renovate it, but it was

clean and livable.

Audrey once ordered all the furniture online. Clayton told her the

dimensions were wrong and the stuff had to be returned. Thus, they didn’t move in yet.

But now, they really couldn’t move in.

The floor was covered with takeout boxes, trash bags, soggy delivery containers, and so on. The once–pristine walls were scribbled with markers in every color. There were dark stains everywhere–god knows what caused them.

In the bedroom, bras and stockings were tossed all over the place. The air reeked of some cheap fruity perfume.

The plants Audrey had bought to clear out the formaldehyde were crammed onto the balcony, dried up like museum specimens.

With the police and building manager present, Audrey snapped photos of everything for evidence. Then she called a moving company. In front of everyone, she packed up all the junk, sealed it in boxes, and had it shipped off to Clayton’s place in Hightower Homes.

When that was done, she asked the police for a formal incident report, changed the lock, and headed to her office to deal with her resignation procedure.

At Ironhaven Medical Center, Clayton’s good friend Carson Wilson pulled some strings to get Luna checked out fast.

After the exam, the doctor said, “She had an allergic reaction that led to temporary airway obstruction. You’ll need to figure out what triggered it. She got here in time, so she’s currently fine. Still, don’t take it lightly.”

“Thank you, doctor.” Valerie’s eyes were full of tears. She clung to Clayton and said, “Clay, I don’t know what I would’ve done without you.”

But she noticed Clayton seemed distracted. Normally, the moment Valerie started crying, Clayton would be right there comforting her. Yet just now, when she tried to lean on him, he actually dodged a bit.

Valerie’s heart dropped, and she thought, ‘No. I can’t let him slip away. Clayton is mine. I have to keep him mine.‘

1ladlxe,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1ladlxe/brothers/,Brothers,"Every family has a story and a history.

Being a 13 year old Asian boy with 2 very Italian parents living in the North End of Boston in the mid 70s was as challenging and odd as you’d expect. My one claim to fame as the oldest out of 3 kids was: “I was the kid mom and dad planned for. The rest a’ya’s were accidents”. That one always made my younger brother laugh and my sisters stick their tongues out at me usually followed by some form of a funny face….but never the Asian face. Yanno what one I mean, the one where you pull the corners of your eyes back. Sometimes followed by a “ohhhh Ching Chong me Chinese”. It’s funny when it’s your sisters. When the kids at school or at the bus top did it, it was just annoying. And slightly racist. Also, not for nothin, I was Korean. South Korean precisely, the good kind….that was a joke. Kinda.

Why was I cursed to look like the polar opposite of everyone around me? Well that’s story in itself but the short version goes like this: Our father, Bill, is currently a state policeman based out the central Boston barracks. He got into police work when I was very young. Before that he was a young man, literally, in Vietnam as an army recon scout platoon leader. And before he was literally a kid in Korea during the Korean War. He was drafted into Korea and while the fighting according to him and many others was brutal and nonstop along the 38th parallel, he made many life long friends. Some of the lengths of the life long friendships were relative as our Ma said that Pop lost a lot of the friends in combat. According to my father he stayed in the army as an obligation and homage to his fallen brothers.

Things were quiet for awhile after that war and that’s when he married Ma. Mother. Mother dearest. His sweet pea. They met as kids and grew up together in a time where everyone grew up generationally in the same few blocks their whole lives and even something like moving across the city was considered a really big deal. And that’s what Nana and Nonno, those are Ma’s parents and my grand parents, did with Ma. They left the slums of the north end (I guess it was slummy back in the day? Because it’s not like that now) and moved West Roxbury when we were only . It was only 6.3 miles away, on the very edge of the city and to a couple of 14 year olds with no cars, no busses, no train fare, and a bicycle shared by Pop and his 12 siblings…..it might has well had been on the moon. Well, that was at least according to my dad. I commute across the city everyday and my father thinks I’m crazy for doing so. I ride my bicycle for exercise now as my knees are gone from my own time in the military and when I did the PanMass challenge and rode 138 miles from Worcester to Cape cod my parents questioned my sanity. What they didn’t know was I got the festival at the end, got hammered, missed my ride back and biked another 48 miles to the closest friends house to crash for the night.

Well between Korea and Vietnam my father had an opportunity to go to some military schools and tried out for the Army Rangers. With all the training he was super busy for a few years but when he was 22 he was home on leave and went out with his buddies and one of the places they ended up, drunk at 3am, was a diner in Roslindale and Ma was their waitress. Full of liquid courage he got to chatting with her and when one of his buddies wolf whistled at her when she was walking away pop knocked thenfella outta the booth and they got to wrestling and punching eachother and breaking up the diner until everyone split it up. Pops buddies loaded up the other guy and said they’d get another car and come him but by this time he was sobering up and the sun was rising so he was gonna walk home. So he left and walked two blocks down the road and my mom pulled up and scolded him for starting that fight and getting coffee on her apron and then asked him if he wanted a ride home. They were inseparable ever since. They set the standard for what love is with eachother and us kids. I’d like to think we are the family we are today because we were a witness to that love.

So I’m new to Bangalore — just moved to Indiranagar recently. I’m 27, male, and had grand plans of exploring cafés, meeting cool people, and living that “new city, new beginnings” vibe.

This is the new reality of SEO, powered by sophisticated artificial intelligence. For years, link building has been the cornerstone of any successful SEO strategy, but it has always been a notoriously manual, time-consuming, and often frustrating process. The endless cycle of finding relevant sites, hunting for contact information, crafting personalized outreach emails, and facing constant rejection is a grind that most marketers know all too well. But what if the entire process, from discovery to placement, could be automated by an intelligent system that works 24/7 to boost your rankings? That's precisely what's happening right now, and it's changing the game forever.

We're talking about an AI that doesn't just automate tasks but executes a complex, nuanced strategy with precision and scale that is simply unattainable for human teams. This article will pull back the curtain on this groundbreaking technology. We'll explore how AI is capable of building backlinks automatically without any human outreach, the incredible advantages this offers, and how you can leverage this ""unfair advantage"" to dominate the search engine results pages (SERPs). Whether you're a burgeoning startup, a thriving enterprise, or a digital marketing agency looking to scale your results, the insights within this article will be invaluable.

# The Grinding Gears of Traditional Link Building

Before we can fully appreciate the revolution, we must first understand the old regime. Traditional link building is a testament to manual labor and persistence, but it's also fraught with inefficiencies and challenges that have plagued the SEO industry for decades. It's a multi-stage process, with each step demanding significant time and resources. This ""old way"" of doing things is not only slow but also incredibly difficult to scale effectively. Let's break down the typical workflow that this new wave of AI is making obsolete.

# 1. Manual Prospecting: The Digital Needle in a Haystack

This is where it all begins. SEOs spend countless hours scouring the web for websites that might be a good fit for a backlink. This involves using search operators, analyzing competitor backlink profiles, and sifting through endless lists of domains. The goal is to find sites that are topically relevant, have high authority, and are likely to link out. It's a tedious process that often yields a low percentage of viable targets.

# 2. The Elusive Contact Information

Once a potential target is identified, the hunt for the right contact person begins. This can mean digging through 'About Us' pages, using tools to find email addresses, or even connecting on social media. More often than not, the generic contact form is the only option, which dramatically reduces the chances of a response.

# 3. ""Personalized"" Outreach at Scale: An Oxymoron

Crafting the perfect outreach email is an art form. It needs to be personalized, compelling, and offer genuine value to the recipient. Now, imagine trying to do this for hundreds or even thousands of prospects. The reality is that true personalization at scale is nearly impossible. Most campaigns end up using templates that are only slightly modified, leading to low open and response rates.

# 4. The Negotiation and Follow-up Dance

If you're lucky enough to get a response, the negotiation begins. This can involve discussing the type of link, the anchor text, and any potential costs. This is followed by a series of follow-up emails to ensure the link goes live as agreed. This back-and-forth can drag on for weeks.

# 5. Content Creation for Link-Worthiness

In many cases, securing a link requires creating a valuable piece of content, such as a guest post. This adds another layer of work, from topic ideation and writing to editing and formatting. This content must meet the quality standards of the host website, which can be a significant undertaking.

# 6. The Black Hole of Reporting

Finally, tracking all these efforts is a monumental task. Spreadsheets are often used to monitor prospects, outreach attempts, responses, and live links. This manual reporting is prone to errors and makes it difficult to gauge the true ROI of a campaign.

# Tired of the Manual Link Building Grind?

Escape the endless cycle of prospecting and outreach. Let our AI take over the entire process, so you can focus on what you do best: growing your business.

# The Magic Behind the Curtain: How AI Builds Links Automatically

So, how exactly does an AI build high-quality backlinks without a single human-sent email? It's a combination of machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and vast data analysis capabilities that work in concert to replicate and vastly improve upon the traditional link-building process. It's not magic; it's a technological marvel. Let's demystify the process and look at the core components of this revolutionary approach.

Abstract visualization of AI data processing for link building

# Phase 1: Deep Semantic Understanding and Prospecting

The process begins with the AI developing a deep understanding of your website's content, niche, and target audience. It doesn't just look at keywords; it uses NLP to understand the semantic context and intent behind your content. It then scours the web, analyzing millions of websites to identify potential link opportunities. This goes far beyond simple domain authority metrics. The AI assesses a site's topical relevance, audience overlap, engagement metrics, and historical linking patterns. This results in a highly curated list of target sites that are a perfect contextual fit for your brand.

# Phase 2: Predictive Link Opportunity Identification

This is where the ""no outreach"" concept truly comes to life. Instead of begging for links, the AI identifies opportunities where a link to your content would genuinely add value. This could be:

* **Broken Link Building at Scale:** The AI constantly crawls the web to find broken links on high-authority pages. When it finds a dead link that is relevant to your content, it can automatically suggest your page as a replacement.
* **Unlinked Brand Mentions:** The AI discovers where your brand is mentioned online without a link and identifies the best way to have a link added.
* **Resource Page Placement:** It finds resource pages, ""best of"" lists, and directories where your website would be a natural and valuable addition.
* **AI-Generated Content for Placements:** In some cases, the AI can generate high-quality, relevant content that is then offered to webmasters, with a contextual link back to your site embedded within it. This is done through automated API integrations and partnerships, not manual email pitching.

# Phase 3: Automated Placement and Verification

Through a network of integrations and partnerships, the AI can facilitate the placement of these links automatically. This is the ""secret sauce"" that eliminates the need for manual outreach. Once a link is placed, the AI continuously monitors it to ensure it remains live and that the anchor text and other attributes are correct. It provides real-time reporting on all new backlinks, giving you a clear view of your growing link profile.

""The AI doesn't just automate the repetitive tasks of link building; it re-imagines the entire process. It's about finding where your link is needed, not just asking for it everywhere.""

This automated, data-driven approach is a paradigm shift. It's more efficient, more scalable, and ultimately, more effective than any manual link-building campaign could ever hope to be. Don't just read about it. [**Click here to see how our AI Linkbuilding Tool gives you this power.**](https://aimonstertools.com/ai-linkbuilding-tool/)

# Manual Grind vs. AI-Powered Automation

The difference between traditional link building and an AI-driven approach is stark. It's like comparing a horse-drawn carriage to a self-driving electric car. Both might eventually get you to your destination, but one is infinitely faster, more efficient, and more scalable. Let's put them side-by-side to see the true disparity.

# The Unfair Advantage: Why AI-Driven Link Building Dominates

So, what does all this advanced technology actually mean for your business? It means gaining a significant, almost unfair, advantage over your competitors who are still stuck in the old ways of manual link building. This isn't just about saving time; it's about achieving superior results that were previously unimaginable. Here are the key advantages that make AI-driven link building a true game-changer:

# 1. Unprecedented Speed and Scale

An AI can analyze millions of data points and execute thousands of actions in the time it takes a human to have their morning coffee. This means you can build a robust backlink profile in a fraction of the time, accelerating your SEO results and leaving your competitors in the dust. Scaling your efforts is as simple as adjusting a setting, not hiring and training a new team.

# 2. Superior Link Quality and Relevance

Human error and bias are eliminated from the prospecting process. The AI's deep semantic analysis ensures that every link comes from a source that is contextually aligned with your content. This leads to a more natural and powerful backlink profile that search engines love. It's quality and quantity, without compromise.

# 3. Massive Cost Savings

The cost of a manual link-building campaign can be astronomical when you factor in salaries, tool subscriptions, and the sheer number of hours required. AI automation dramatically reduces the cost per link, allowing you to achieve a much higher ROI on your SEO investment. This makes high-level link building accessible to businesses of all sizes.

# 4. A Proactive, Not Reactive, Strategy

Traditional link building is often reactive, chasing opportunities as they arise. An AI-driven approach is proactive. It constantly monitors the web for new opportunities, anticipates trends, and builds links in a steady, strategic manner. This creates a sustainable and long-term SEO advantage.

# 5. Focus on What Matters Most

By automating the most tedious and time-consuming part of SEO, you are free to focus on other high-impact activities like content strategy, user experience, and conversion rate optimization. Let the AI handle the grind while you focus on what really grows your business—[**see how our service can free up your time**](https://aimonstertools.com/ai-linkbuilding-service/).

# 6. Data-Driven Insights and Predictability

The AI provides clear, actionable data on your link-building efforts. You can see what's working, track your progress in real-time, and make informed decisions about your SEO strategy. This level of predictability is a breath of fresh air in the often-unpredictable world of SEO.

This isn't just a better way to do link building; it's the *only* way to stay competitive in the years to come. The advantage is so significant that businesses who adopt this technology will create an insurmountable gap between themselves and those who don't. The question is no longer *if* you should automate your link building, but *how quickly* you can get started. Don't get left behind.

For as long as I can remember, I’ve had this tendency to dive deeply into things—obsessing over whatever catches my interest, from coffee brewing to virtual reality.

And like many of you, I’ve seen that question pop up over and over again: “Am I too old to start learning this?” I used to brush it off when it came to certain things. But when it came to others—like bodybuilding, or drawing—it somehow stuck with me. It made me hesitate.

Then, a few weeks ago, something changed. It was Guitar Day here in Wroclaw, where I live, and I decided to buy a guitar. I hadn’t touched one in nearly twenty years. And sure, all the doubts rushed in: “Is this a smart purchase? Will I actually play it? Is this just another short-lived obsession? Should I see a therapist?”

But I bought it anyway. My wife encouraged me, and it wasn’t even that expensive.

When I got home, I started playing—clumsily, painfully. My hands hurt. I was stiff. But I kept coming back to it, day after day. I started learning songs I’ve loved for years. I started studying things I ignored as a teenager—triads, root notes, music theory. And something incredible happened:

I was loving every minute of it.

Then one day, while scrolling Reddit, I saw that same old post again: “Am I too old to start learning guitar?” And it struck me. I realized that with so many past interests, I had paid attention to those posts and videos. I had let that question plant seeds of doubt—“I’m too old, I don’t have time, I’ll never be good enough.” And just like that, I’d move on.

But this time? I didn’t even flinch. I didn’t listen to the noise. And that’s when I knew: this wasn’t just another passing interest. This was something real. A true passion. And I honestly don’t care if I’m “too old” or “too busy” to learn scales—I just want to do it. I’m having fun. I feel alive doing it.

So if you’ve been wondering “Am I too old to start?”—let me tell you from the heart: you’re not.

You want to learn to skate? Go for it.
You want to hit the gym? Go for it.
You want to learn how to cook, paint, dance, code, sing? Go for it.

There is nothing wrong with trying something new. And who knows—you might just uncover a passion that brings you joy, growth, and a spark you didn’t even know you were missing.

And I say resolved because for example, she tells me I'm not doing enough house work? I draft a whole schedule with shared responsibilities. Got mad at me for not keeping the kitchen clean? Anytime I cooked and ate ever since last year, I'd immediately wash dishes or let them know if anything is getting soaked beforehand. So I do not understand why bro turned past things as issues because when I startdd finding out bro had beef with me, it was during a month where I was submerged with work and we barely interacted because she refused to come home. And even before that, I asked if we were okay and she said yes and that life just isn't lifing. So my only reaction was ""what did I do?""

Despite how I'd see bro post about me and I wanted to confront her ass, I never did because I had exams and maybe bro needed an outlet Idk. Then one night she comes out saying she wants to address things and so I went out of my way to address things too. Like how she was lowkey a control freak with how much she went on with reminders and how weird it is that whenever I try to set boundaries as well or tells her to do something, bro deflects by ""is it a difference in culture"" ""it's an honest mistake"" or outright mock my own set boundary? She got annoyed at me for using my phone as we were eating and said she had problems with self importance. Whenever I'd be in a call she would have no shame and keep visiting my room and knocking?? She was comfortable in me starving or not being able to take a bath because the bathroom was in her room and with the cooking she told me its too late and she cant take the smell despite the existing exhaust in the kitchen. When I'd rant she told me that I should ask permission first because sometimes not in the mood, but then during rest days or at 3am or at 8am she'd send paragraphs upon paragraphs of her being anxious or completely draining things like ""i can't sleep i can't sleep why is the world so noisy it's so annoying i did everything i can"" and it was so bad because I certainly did not want to be a trashbag for emotional outbursts and it was so inconsiderate on my end. And during the days I was resting and we had a fight after I reacted badly to her anxious outburst, she outright unfairly concluded I just didn't care after months of me trying to appease her despite how demanding she is. Also she unfriended some people I broke off friendship with because she felt like she was being squeezed... and Imma be real why is she up in her head involving herself in a fight that was never hers and saying shes getting squeezed between us 😭🙏 This was when she stopped coming home and despite how we talked and tried to address things that time, bro just deadass kept at never coming home. And I thought we were okay because again, I communicated and asked if we were good and bro said yes. I was so surprised to find bro breaking down and being a bitch about things just as I graduated? Apparently everything that's happened throughout? She turned into an issue and was ruminating all those times we weren't even interacting

And then, the days she was packing she took a bag we got from buying stuff so I put the wifi extension which was also shared in my room in case since at this point I was convinced she would take everything owned to her. Little did I know this would cause another outburst for her wherein she'd send so many messages at 8am and it was so weird to see because it was basically seeing everything as negative and it was crazy to see my friend who initially told me to see humanity in people turn into a dogpile who defined everyone on their mistakes alone.
For example she stated that she thinks im mean to this older woman we know and that I give her a side eye everytime (lowkey kinda crazy because mb my eyes are dead and tired and i look like a bitch?) But also literally this older woman and I are still super friends and they've even neen comforting me about this matter. And again, this just proves to me that bro is so mental that even interactions without any deeper meaning, she finds a way to make it negative?? I also stated I cleaned the house because one point of anxiety of hers was getting kicked out by the owner and I did this to show her I cared and alleviate the anxiety but now her reply was ""Why do you make it look like you're such a good person like oooh i should be thankful to you oooh"" and I'm just confused as hell. Am I the problem or is she just a bubble of negative energy and viewing everything in a negative light?

But anyways I never responded to her becahse honest to God it's a waste of time and I was looking for employment. Then her girlfriend also finds it in her heart to harrass me in my dms with a ""tldr: LEAVE HER ALONE"" and even telling me to shut up and not spread anything...???? when the friend doesn't even receive any chats from me nor do I post anything out of respect ?? Ahahah 😭 and then this same person chats me the next day ""i forgot to block you"". Is this normal? Did I really do something so bad? Did we not live the same experience wherein this friend of mine would breakdown at every second and even slammed a door at my face as I asked if she was okar or...?? Or am I just dealing with ill-mannered people 😭 it's also so weird because even with my friends mad at her, I've never had any thought to send any of them her way and angrily chat. It's simply not their place.
I never responded to any of these because I'm graduated and obviously I'm going to choose to rest. Still it's so odd to have all of this happen after my biggest success and at this point I'm confused if I should be genuinely sorry for something or if I should step up because it does kind of feel like harrassment 

But deadass, what the hell is this and am I the asshole

Edit: she already left the house! But yeah she managed to send paragraphs of texts the day after she left and then her gf came for my ass in dms too just as I was at a job hunting conference and 🥀🥀 Lowkey starting to think my silence enraged them and they started assuming more things on my end.

**The Coffee Cup Test methodology:** Observe customers during peak hours. Note how many have to manipulate objects (coffee, bags, phones, keys) to complete payment. Track correlation between object juggling and payment friction.

**Data points from 500+ checkout observations:**

* **67% of customers** carry 2+ objects during payment
* **Terminal placement forces object repositioning**: 43% of transactions
* **Payment completion time increases 40%** when customers must put down items
* **Card decline rate 2.3x higher** when customers can't hold terminal steady

**The ergonomic failure patterns:**

* Terminals positioned for merchant convenience, not customer reach
* Screen angles optimized for employee viewing, creating customer glare
* Signature pads placed assuming customers have dominant hand free
* Chip readers requiring wrist contortions for natural card insertion

**Industry implications:** This isn't just UX optimization—it's conversion impact. Every ergonomic friction point increases abandonment risk. For high-transaction-volume merchants, even 1% improvement in payment completion translates to significant revenue.

**The anthropological insight:** Payment behavior is physical behavior. Customers don't just process payments—they navigate spatial constraints, manipulate objects, and adapt to merchant-defined interaction patterns.

**Question for the community:** How many payment implementations have you seen that actually tested real customer ergonomics? Most seem designed for demo scenarios rather than actual retail environments.

**Looking for examples of merchants who've optimized terminal placement based on customer observation rather than POS vendor recommendations.**",1,1749813793.0,AllAboutPayments,0,1.0,False

For as long as I can remember, I’ve had this tendency to dive deeply into things—obsessing over whatever catches my interest, from coffee brewing to virtual reality.

And like many of you, I’ve seen that question pop up over and over again: “Am I too old to start learning this?” I used to brush it off when it came to certain things. But when it came to others—like bodybuilding, or drawing—it somehow stuck with me. It made me hesitate.

Then, a few weeks ago, something changed. It was Guitar Day here in Wroclaw, where I live, and I decided to buy a guitar. I hadn’t touched one in nearly twenty years. And sure, all the doubts rushed in: “Is this a smart purchase? Will I actually play it? Is this just another short-lived obsession? Should I see a therapist?”

But I bought it anyway. My wife encouraged me, and it wasn’t even that expensive.

When I got home, I started playing—clumsily, painfully. My hands hurt. I was stiff. But I kept coming back to it, day after day. I started learning songs I’ve loved for years. I started studying things I ignored as a teenager—triads, root notes, music theory. And something incredible happened:

I was loving every minute of it.

Then one day, while scrolling Reddit, I saw that same old post again: “Am I too old to start learning guitar?” And it struck me. I realized that with so many past interests, I had paid attention to those posts and videos. I had let that question plant seeds of doubt—“I’m too old, I don’t have time, I’ll never be good enough.” And just like that, I’d move on.

But this time? I didn’t even flinch. I didn’t listen to the noise. And that’s when I knew: this wasn’t just another passing interest. This was something real. A true passion. And I honestly don’t care if I’m “too old” or “too busy” to learn scales—I just want to do it. I’m having fun. I feel alive doing it.

So if you’ve been wondering “Am I too old to start?”—let me tell you from the heart: you’re not.

You want to learn to skate? Go for it.
You want to hit the gym? Go for it.
You want to learn how to cook, paint, dance, code, sing? Go for it.

There is nothing wrong with trying something new. And who knows—you might just uncover a passion that brings you joy, growth, and a spark you didn’t even know you were missing.

Don’t let the question “Am I too old?” stop you. Let the better question be: “What if this changes my life?”",2,1749813781.0,Positivity,0,1.0,False

But honestly, this has been putting a bit of a toll on me. I really liked her and was finally starting to get comfortable enough to make these moves, which I usually shy away from. I wish I did better and I honestly don’t want it to end, but for my own sake and being respectful, I told her I understood and decided to go no contact and somewhat avoid her.

It’s been a few weeks, and she reached out congratulating me on one of my biggest accomplishments in life. I thanked her and left it at that. She later replied saying she just wanted to let me know she doesn’t want things to be weird and hopes nothing’s changed. She also followed up saying if anything’s bothering me, she’d be happy to chat in person, with a “😊”.

She said she doesn’t want things to change, but I’m not really sure what that means. I still want to get to know her, one-on-one and hang out like we used to, but I guess that’s probably out of the question now.

Anyway now It’s been a day and I still haven’t replied to that text. It’s been eating me up because I want to be respectful, but at the same time, I want to open up and try to save this (I think this one is really worth it) I’m just not sure how.",1,1749813770.0,dating_advice,5,1.0,False

Here's what I call the ""coffee cup test"": Watch customers at checkout. If they have to put down their coffee, bag, or phone to reach your payment terminal, you're losing money.

**Our nightmare scenario at the smoke shop:**

* Terminal mounted 18 inches to the left of register
* Customer has to lean across counter, awkward angle
* Card keeps declining because they can't hold it steady
* Takes 3 attempts, line backs up
* Next customer sees the struggle, pays cash instead
* Conversion drops 12% during morning rush

**The ergonomics are insane:**

* Terminal faces the ceiling (why??)
* Screen reflection makes it impossible to read in afternoon sun
* Signature pad positioned for right-handed giants only
* Chip reader placement requires customers to contort their wrist

**High-risk merchants can't afford this friction.** Every declined transaction gets flagged. Every awkward interaction makes customers question legitimacy. Every extra 30 seconds at checkout creates line anxiety that kills impulse purchases.

**What's working for you?** Anyone actually solved payment terminal ergonomics without ripping out their entire POS setup? Need solutions that work for real-world customer behavior, not whatever the payment company's demo video showed.

I found myself sitting alone on my balcony, cup of coffee in hand, no major life events to disrupt, just birds chirping and me... well, contemplating the molecular structure of emotions apparently. 

First off, there’s the recurring pattern of thoughts, a sorta cognitive symphony that plays when everything aligns just right. It’s like my brain hit shuffle on a ‘Chill Vibes’ playlist, each intrusive thought interjecting like a slightly offbeat percussion, contributing to a complex rhythm of not much happening. 

Then, there’s the physiological shifts. My skin’s conductance probably dropped, though I didn’t exactly have a measurement device handy. But if I were to estimate, I’d say it’s similar to what happens when my cat finally decides to snuggle up—an observable decrease in tension paired with a slight uptick in melatonin vibes. 

We dive deeper into the environmental cues... Picture this: a gentle breeze playing with my hair and a panoramic sky-view doing its thing, causing my pupil dilation to stabilize (again, estimated), which ideally correlates with my overall peace quota. Action urges? Non-existent. The call to scroll endlessly through social media stopped, favoring organic engagement with the world's odd wallpaper.

Social solitude, funny enough, seems to act as a lubricant for this contentment engine, reducing friction by proving that maybe all I need for a second of happiness is less noise. Or maybe it’s just coffee's underrated prowess; another experiment for another day.

This feeling feels like tending to a humble garden of calm; no rush, just an appreciation of subtly flowering thoughts. Imo, it’s wild how dissecting a ‘simple’ moment turns it into an emotional lab report. 🌼",4,1749813740.0,feelingsUnderMicrosco,0,1.0,False
1ladcsb,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ladcsb/i_almost_got_arrested_at_an_airport_by_accident/,I almost got arrested at an airport by accident,"This just happened a few days ago and I can’t stop thinking about it. I feel like I need to get it off my chest before I lose my mind.

  


I (26M) was flying home after visiting some family. Normal day, normal airport. I got to the airport early, breezed through security, and was just waiting at my gate with headphones in, watching some dumb YouTube videos to pass the time. Nothing out of the ordinary.

  


Then, about 30 minutes before boarding, two security officers walk up to me and ask if they can talk to me. At first, I thought maybe I dropped something or they had a routine question. I take my headphones out and say sure. One of them immediately asks me to stand up and put my hands where they can see them.

  


At this point, I’m frozen. People are staring. I’m confused as hell and my heart is racing. I ask what’s going on and they tell me there’s been a report of a suspicious item in a bag that matches mine.

  


They take me aside (in front of everyone, by the way) and ask me if the bag by the seat is mine. I say yes. They start questioning me about where I’ve been, what’s in the bag, did I pack it myself, etc. It honestly felt like something out of a movie.

  


Turns out someone reported a black backpack with a red patch left unattended in the terminal—and mine matched that description exactly. But here’s the thing: I had been right next to it the whole time. I wasn’t leaving it behind or anything.

  


After about 10 minutes of questioning, checking my ID, scanning the bag, and basically treating me like I was about to get thrown in Guantanamo, they finally cleared it. Apparently another backpack (same color, same patch—wtf) had actually been left behind three gates over, and someone mixed up the locations when reporting it.

  


The officers apologized, kind of, but you could tell they were just relieved it wasn’t anything serious. I didn’t even get a “sorry for scaring the crap out of you” or anything. Just, “Thanks for cooperating.”

  


I know they were doing their job, but it’s terrifying how fast you can go from sipping your overpriced airport coffee to being treated like a criminal over something you didn’t even do. I’m not mad at the officers specifically, but the whole experience has left me on edge. I keep replaying it in my head.

  


I didn’t even enjoy my flight. I just sat there wondering how different things could’ve gone if I’d said the wrong thing, or reached into my bag too fast. Honestly, I’m still kind of shook.

  


Anyway, thanks for letting me vent. I know it’s not the craziest story in the world, but it really messed with me.

2. Once a week, I do a gentle **douche with water 1/4apple cider vinegar and dab of hydrogen peroxide**, as someone here previously suggested. 
3. I also drink a mix of **apple cider vinegar and baking soda** at night basically 2 table spoons ac and flat tsp on baking soda stir in 4 oz of pure Zero water filtered water. Give room for fizz in larger glass. I also do a teaspoon of just ac during the day in glass of water
4. I **insert estriol/estradiol**, which has been supportive in building back my vaginal tissue and bladder
5. Finally, I take **ivermectin liquid**, which for me has been a complete game changer, much more effective than Dmanose

She looked around sleepily, still in the underwear and breastplate from the previous evening. She noticed a note on the bedside table.

‘Had to head out, please take your time, there is coffee and breakfast things in the kitchen. Don’t forget to the contents of your pink box or forget to lock that clitty away! It belongs to me now!’ 

Mia borrowed one of Angie’s dressing gowns and wandered down to the kitchen.
She made herself a coffee and helped herself to one of the croissants on the side.

“It must be nice to live like this…” she thought to herself.

She knew she had to go back to the flat at some point but she really wasn’t in a hurry.
She lazed around the house for a while. Her hole definitely felt the effects of last nights use, it was delightfully sore. 
She spotted the pink tip box on the side and checked inside it.  There was £450! This was an unexpected bonus but there was something nagging at her. She hadn’t felt like whore last night as she pandered to the men’s needs but now she felt very whore-ish.  She didn’t quite know how to feel about it, on one hand she felt a bit dirty and used but on the other it was kind of hot and she did have an amazing time last night and  frankly she needed the money!

When she could put it off no longer she headed to the boudoir, undressed, showered and put her drab back on. It felt odd being Daniel after twenty hours of being Mia.

Daniel ordered an Uber and headed back to his flat on The Estate.

Daniel spent the rest of the weekend relaxing, recovering and sorting out the flat. He had a big meeting with senior management at work on Wednesday and the preparation of all the data and reporting would take pretty much all of Monday and Tuesday, he was bracing himself for a lot of work on the first three days of the week and hoped Angie’s spot checks would not impact his efficiency too much.

Daniel worked late into the night on both Monday and Tuesday pulling together all the boring info for the management review so when Wednesday came he felt as prepared as he possibly could be.

On Wednesday morning as he filed into the boardroom with the rest of middle management he switched his phone to silent as per company policy.
The management review went as well as could be expected but it was still a relief when he got back to his desk 4 hours later.
He pulled his phone out of his suit pocket.
15 missed calls. 
3 texts.
All from Angie.

“Fuck” Daniel said under his breath.
He read the texts.
A> Time for your spot check, call me back asap! 
A> This is not acceptable, call me immediately. 
A> You have broken my trust! There will be consequences!

Daniel’s heart sank, what on earth would she do?  He quickly checked his social media accounts. Thankfully they looked fine, no untoward activity nor DMs sent so she hadn’t used the nuclear option of outing him via his own social media.

He plucked up the courage to text her back.

D> So so sorry Angie! I was stuck in a phone free meeting with all my bosses! I can assure you my cage is in place.

A> VIDEO CALL NOW!!!

Daniel rushed to the loo and quickly locked the door behind him. He knew the drill. He dropped his trousers and boxers and video-called Angie.
She answered and without even a hello said “Show me”

He pointed the camera at the small plastic cage encasing his cock.

“Good” she said and hung up.

Daniel was both relieved and still worried.
The rest of the week eventually passed by and Friday lunchtime soon rolled around, people in the office were comparing notes about their plans for the weekend. When asked what his plans were Daniel said “Oh, just chill and watch the footy.” In reality he was looking forward to transforming himself into Mia and hopefully having some sexy fun but he was nervous that he hadn’t heard from Angie who seemed to be giving him the silent treatment. 

Thankfully, later that afternoon Daniel got a text from Angie.
A>I think considering your little indiscretion this week I need to test your loyalty. Get yourself dressed up at yours as best you can. Wear your sluttiest clothing I’ll pick you up at 11:30pm.
D> OK, sorry again.

After a light dinner Daniel got himself ready, a good shave, douche and shower with feminine scented toiletries made him feel nicely feminine.

Daniel wriggled into his breast plate, slipped into black and red lace thong, matching suspender belt and bustier and slipped on some stockings. 

He selected the sluttiest clothing he could leave the house in, a very short black leather pleated skirt that had been paid for by the money he had earned at Angie’s and had arrived this week twinned with a low cut leopard print top.

The outfit was completed with his favourite leopard print stack heels and a black cropped faux fur jacket.

He applied make up transforming himself into a very slutty version of Mia. Bright red lips, plenty of eyeshadow, big false lashes, long press on nails and blusher topped with an auburn wig. His appearance was almost drag like. He had definitely picked up some tips at Angie’s.

Mia was ready a little early so she sat on the sofa and had a glass of wine whilst wondering what ‘delights’ Angie had in store for her tonight.

A text from Angie arrived with a ping.
A> I’ve ordered you an Uber. It’ll be with you in a few minutes.

Mia gathered a few things into a little black shoulder bag. Phone, some cash, condoms, lube, lippy and a few other make up bits.

The intercom went and Mia answered “Hello?”
“Uber for Mia” the voice replied.

Mia took a final gulp of wine and headed downstairs, locked the door and hopped in the Uber.

On the drive she could see the driver was looking at her in the mirror, staring at her heavy make up and slutty outfit. She wondered what he must have thought.

It became abundantly clear very quickly that Mia was not being taken to Angie’s, she wondered where in earth she was being taken.  What did Angie in store for her?

The uber pulled into an industrial area on the edge of town.

“Here OK?” Asked the driver coming to an abrupt halt.

“Errrrrrrr, yeah…” Mia replied

Mia exited the car whilst trying and ultimately failing to not expose herself to the  driver.

She pulled her jacket closed and assessed her situation.
She had been dropped in what could only be described as the worst area of town. She looked down the road and noticed five or six working girls plying their trade.

Her phone pinged with a text.
A> Walk down to where those girls are. A friend will “proposition” you.  Get in. Suck him off. Take his money.

“Oh my god…what the actual Fuck!!” Mia thought to herself.  Mia weighed up the alternatives. She could do as she was told and there was the slight chance that she could get arrested. If she didn’t do as she was told she would enrage Angie and god knows what she would do.

Mia made the decision to do as she was told.

She tottered down the street, incredibly aware of her surroundings.  As she drew closer she could see the girls getting in and out of cars belonging to punters.  She could see the cars disappearing into the industrial estate presumably as it was quiet and the girls could turn their tricks in peace.
The girls outfits made hers look positively Victorian! The girls were basically just wearing their lingerie standing on a street corner.
As she approached the corner that the girls were working, a blue BMW pulled up alongside her.
Mia’s heart was beating out of her chest.
The driver wolf whistled.
She turned to face him and he gestured for her to come over. She bent over at the hips.
“Open for business love?” asked the driver.
“S s s sure…” Mia stammered nervously.
“BJ for £30?” he asked
Mia nodded and the driver opened the passenger door. Mia climbed in.
The driver was white, very overweight and smelt like cigarettes and greasy food.
“In the estate?” he asked.
“Yes hun” she replied.

The man drove them down the road towards the estate.

Mia’s phone pinged.
A>Where are you??? My guy can’t find you!
M>I’m with him now, fat guy, blue BMW
A>You’re not!  That’s not him!
M> Fuck
A> LOL 

Mia realised in her eagerness to get this over and done with she hadn’t actually asked the man if he knew Angie.

The car pulled into the Industrial Estate and drove over to the far corner of the car park.
The driver shut off the engine, turned and proffered a tenner and a twenty.

There was a very good reason why this man used hookers, he was deeply unattractive. 

Mia gulped. She had to make a quick decision. Go through with it or explain what had happened and possibly enrage this man whilst she was alone with him in a dark car park.

She took the money and tucked it in her purse. 

The man unzipped and pulled out his cock. It wasn’t big and it wasn’t really hard.
Mia undid her seatbelt, moistened her lips and leant over. Taking the head of his cock in her mouth. Her nostrils were invaded with the smell of musty sweaty cock and balls.

Her head bobbed up and down the fat man’s cock and it started to harden. 
He put his hand on the back of her head pushing it deeper into the depths of his fetid crotch. 
He was actually hard now and had grown considerably, each repetition shoved his cock into her throat. Maybe he would cum soon Mia hoped.
She pushed her head back against his hand so he could control the speed of her head bobs. He sped up basically using her mouth as a fleshlight.
He grunted and pushed her head down harder and further. Mia felt his cock erupt in her throat filling her mouth with his sour semen.
“Swallow” he commanded and Mia gagged it down.
After he felt the swallow he allowed Mia up.
“I needed that, thanks.” he said “Drop you back at the same place?”
Mia nodded.  After briefly composing herself, she checked and touched up her make up in the passenger mirror, whilst the guy tucked himself away.
The fat man drove her back to the area with the girls who eyed her suspiciously as she got out of the BMW.  Mia suspected she might have just stole a regular punter from one of the girls.
Mia walked for a minute or so away from the working girls when a red Audi pulled over and the driver wound his window down.
“Mia? Angie’s girl?” the driver asked
“Yes!” she replied and immediately climbed into the car.
“Great, I’m Paul” he responded.
The driver was a red headed quite thin man in his late fifties.
“I have been looking all over for you, where have you been?” Paul asked.
“Well, I got into a car with a random guy and ended up having to suck his cock for money!” Mia replied
“You were supposed to do that for me!” laughed Paul
Mia’s phone pinged
A> What happened? Have you found my friend?
M> Well I sucked off a fat man and got paid 30 quid. Yes I have found Paul. 
A> Ha ha, you cheap slut. Make sure you pleasure Paul.

“So would you like a BJ?” Mia asked Paul
“Too bloody right I would! I’ve been driving round for ages to find you, let’s get out of this shit hole though yeah?” Paul replied laughing “Oh and there is a bottle of water and some breath mints in the glove box” 

Mia took advantage of his hospitality and neutralised the taste of the fat man’s cock and cum in her mouth.

Paul drove them out of town to a local beauty spot known for late night al fresco liasons.  Pulling into the car park, there were a few cars but no obvious signs of life. 
Paul got out of the car.
“Come with me” he said and they walked down the path to a secluded area with a bench.
Paul unzipped and pulled out a very nice sized and thankfully sweet smelling cock.
Mia squatted down and started sucking Paul’s hardening cock.

Mia was soon aware of the presence of other men around them emerging from the darkness.
“Can we have a go?” one of the men asked.
“What do you think Mia?” Paul asked.
Mia nodded her mouth full of Paul’s cock.
They surrounded Mia, their hands all over her, groping her, tugging at her clothes and her caged clitty, calling her names.
“She’s a right slapper”
“Nice big falsies”
“Proper cum hungry whore”
“Slag”

“Hands up if want to fuck me” Mia calmly asked taking control of the situation and Paul’s cock out of her mouth. 
All their hands shot up.

Mia got to her feet and handed them all, aside from Paul, a condom from her purse, pulled her thong to one side and applied lube to her hole and the nearest covered cock.

She bent over the bench exposing her hole and a young man guided his up cock against her hole, grasped her hips and in one smooth movement was balls deep inside her. 

“Nice and quick boys, give me good fucking, fill your rubber or come round and give it to me in my mouth.” Mia demanded

The young man’s pace quickened and her grunted as he filled his condom.
“Empty it into my mouth” Mia told the young man who had been replaced by another older guy who was now inside her.
The young man took his condom and squeezed the cum out of it into Mia’s open mouth.

“Proper filth” he said.

The older guy was nearing climax and he decided to directly deposit his salty load into Mia’s mouth so came round to her head, pulled off his condom and shot his load onto her tongue.

Paul was next up and he was allowed as one of Angie’s friends to bareback Mia. He fucked her hard and delivered a big load of spunk deep into her guts.

Two more guys remained unsatisfied a young Indian lad and older fatter white guy.

The Indian was next and as he pushed his brown cock into Mia, it pushed some of Paul’s cum out, she could feel it dribble down her leg.  The Indian didn’t take more than a few strokes to approach climax. He pulled his cock out, pulled off the rubber and emptied his balls over Mia’s arse before slapping it and walking off.

The last guy whilst not much to look at but was hung like a horse. As he pushed the head of his cock in Mia gasped as it stretched her hole.
He slowly eased the rest of his length in and started to stroke in and out Mia got accustomed to the girth and the length, and started to feel waves of pleasure.  Mia’s clitty started to leak heavily.
Paul had gotten hard again by this point and was wanking his cock watching the show.
The well hung man railed Mia for a good ten minutes, when he was close he pulled out, removed his condom and wanked himself over Mia’s face. When he came Mia opened her mouth but only caught a fraction of his load that landed on her face in sticky thick ropes. 
Paul pushed his cock into her mouth and delivered his second load down her throat.

Mia was now completely spent and utterly used. 

She scooped the cum from her face and licked her fingers as the two men pulled up their trousers.

Paul walked Mia back to his car.
“There are wet wipes in the door” he cackled

“You owe me at least fifty quid!” Mia laughed.

I have no idea why you’re playing on my mind today, it’s been.. maybe 7? Years and I just.. maybe it’s the music I’m listening to, maybe it’s awakened something because I’m leaving town soon, and I know we’ve tread the same streets at one point or another. 

Tinder-the customary ‘which language do you feel better communicating in’, the elation at finding ‘one of us’ both in town and online. This, isn’t as rare as it used to be, these days. It was then. I was a fresh faced uni student trying to get by on fuckin smokes and coffee then. I don’t smoke anymore; and I haven’t had an English coffee in about as many years. 

I opted for our native, because part of me kinda thought it would make you comfortable. It did! We got on like a house on fire, we swapped music, sleepless nights, silly musings, I got you to watch what was my favourite film then. I watched whatever documentaries you were watching. 

I learnt language from you, you learnt language from me. It was just a really warm, comfortable pairing. Your name rolls off the tongue like silk, still. We took the piss about how people pronounce our names (my last, your first) 

And then.. something died within us. Years later I would cry in my mother’s car over you. 

Today, all I carry is a gratitude, to have been your choice for that many months at least. I was ‘canım’ to you, you never used my name. 

Today all I carry is the same warmth I carried then, it’s light flickers, it no longer burns like an inferno. Today as I sit, Turkish coffee to one side, my dogs to the other side of me, I remember you fondly. Even if I became nothing to you, I will always hold your name in the crevice of my ribcage. You will always rise and fall with each biting breath.

This is another reason why I'm uploading because I forgot to mention this as well, besides the other stuff I did add yesterday. Please discontinue reading this if you're looking for a casual contact on your Discord; please don't message me if you want to text every 3-5 days.

You can either download Discord or just let my message go if you've received a missed message from me.

No thanks, this is not how I will be anymore, so that's why you have to read these two links before you do. Thanks!

I'm seeking frequent, constant contacts that share my similar interests that you can browse on my profile on my pinned posts and comments, and I would love Lorna Shoring contacts as well that wouldn't mind frequently talking about Lorna Shoring together, haha. I'd like to mention something as well about video gaming that I should address as well, as this is quite dry, and it's something that isn't too troublesome for me. The majority of people that come into my life don't have a Nintendo account or play Nintendo co-op games, and while it is okay that you're not, at least we still got Fall Guys, and I know nobody plays RS anymore, so I'm thinking about uninstalling that from my Asus TUF Gaming 2024 laptop. With that being stated, I'm just a casual light gamer kind of gal and always have been; it's okay with me and isn't too troublesome if you don't share the same lightness as me gaming or having a Nintendo account/playing co-op Nintendo games; it's okay. This isn't troublesome, because there are so many conversations that are substitutes when we can't play games together. It's honestly truthfully no big deal that we can't play games together; it's totally cool with me.

I've been a Nintendo purchaser of the $20 yearly plan for 4 years and counting.

My gold badge/Crown Rank on Fall Guys is level 54.

I normally just play Mario Kart 8 and Luigi's Mansion 3 on my Switch. For Luigi 3, my friend has the DLC content, and I don't. Even if I don't, I can still do the floors if my friend picks a DLC content level. Funny enough, I never completed the story and only unlocked the co-op part.

For Mario 3D World, I've already completed the game with a team of 4; the only thing not completed is the Champions Road level, and the only thing I've completed with the same team of 4 is the Toad maze level. I have no interest in completing the rest. But yes, to unlock that, you must unlock all gold poles and all green stars, and that's how you unlock Rosalina. You can unlock Rosalina before Champions Road. I've not played Mario Wonder in about over a month and a half; I just find that game not as exciting as Mario 3D World, and co-op mode is strange, awkward, and not really for me. If my friend asks to play the game, then sure, I'll load the game. I can't get into Splatoon 2-3 anymore, and I never will. I personally believe I did already delete my game files off my Switch.

For Mario Kart 8, I don't have the bonus tracks purchased, but that doesn't really matter, honestly, because as long as someone in worldwide races has purchased the bonus tracks already, then you can go ahead and select one of the bonus tracks on the random randomizer, so that really defeats the point of me wasting my SS! check of $25. I'd prefer if we did a mix of battles and races. If you're interested in playing with me, I'm not interested in playing in the afternoon, and I'd normally play always after dinner or late at night. If you need help on 3D World, I can try my best, but I'm not that skilled; that's why I had a team of 4 that could help me. If getting Rosalina is as far as you want to go, then just trying to get that by yourself or even with two players, you might as well just forget it, haha.

There is a non-cheat way to get over 800 lives on 3D World, by the way; one of the 4 players taught me how to do it, haha. It's quick, easy, and it's in the first world. Speaking of 3D World, I don't think collecting all the stamps is part of getting to Rosalina's world and getting her. I do know all gold flagpoles and all green stars are collected. Could be either one of those.

Yes, I should also state that I did collect all the stamps as well, haha.

My friend is a little bit more serious on Fall Guys than on MK8, so if you're a rookie on either one of those games, it's best to join me on MK8, haha. My friend doesn't really take MK8 as seriously as she does Fall Guys, but I mean if you know how to jump and dive well, that is just fine; there are some players on Fall Guys that don't even know how to do either of those. One time my friend and I saw a squad member on our team (no, I didn't add this player to my team; they were a random player). They just gave up doing Lily Leapers and just sat there by the lily pad drum because they didn't know how to dive and kept falling off. Haha, my friend and I just had no comment.

Once you add me on my Nintendo profile or Fall Guys, which you can find in the Discord hashtags of my Discord server, then you can just randomly join my group if you see me online in Mario Kart 8. Luigi and Fall Guys. You can randomly join, but please don't start a Nintendo voice chat because neither my friend nor I will be talking on the microphone because, as you already know, I rarely do video voice calls, and my friend isn't interested in turning her microphone on either. I'd only just added myself on my Nintendo account and not sent a friend request out to my friend. Just join me if you see me online in Mario Kart 8 or Luigi. Fall Guys is the same request; don't add her, just add me on Fall Guys and hit join request if you see me online, thanks.

If you're wondering something, yes, I sent a group text message out to my friend, who is player two, and two other people I texted to ask if it's okay to help me 100 percent complete 3D World together because they themselves have already completed Mario Party 3D World and didn't mind helping us complete Mario 3D World as long as that wasn't completing the final optional stage, Champion's Road, haha.

For Animal Crossing, I hardly play that game anymore. I don't even have the focus to even complete my fish collection, even though that's almost done. My deep-sea diving is the same. I don't remember much of how the list looks, and the same goes for the bug collection, but I'd know that I need only about maybe 10 or less of my deep sea dive and bug collection.

My paintings and statues are a decent catalog of what I donated. My fossils are complete. I've already got a Brewster bag of coffee and the cup already, plus the Brewster Cookie DIY.

I'd have a VERY expansive catalog. I've collected a lot of furniture and items from Tom Nook, and I mean A LOT, haha. If you ever need me to log in to see if I can help you catalog something, then just ask. There is a VERY high guarantee that I have what you're looking for, and I can get that customized for you with no charge if needed. I wouldn't be able to help much on the Sanrio furniture besides Kiki and Lala.

Other things we could do—that is an idea that I'd share with someone else.

There is a guy in my contacts on Discord who sometimes messages me on Discord to go on YT for a private livestream just so we can just chat the night away while watching him play a game; however, he is the only one I do this with, because I don't really have anyone in the late lifestyle like him and me. For people wondering about the private chat on YT, it's just friendly friendship conversations about life and video games. 

You should just do a phone call instead. I don't like phone calls, sorry. There are pinned posts somewhere on my profile that talk about my autistic sensory issues that I have because I have very bad autistic spectrum sensory issues that hinder my day-to-day life constantly. I only do phone calls unless it's an emergency, and the same friend I'm talking about, whenever we do Fall Guys, I turn my microphone on, and I only make commentary when I want to because my friend doesn't force me to speak on the microphone and go, ""Hello?"" Are you there? Hello? Constantly, he takes my autistic spectrum sensory issues seriously. I will say I'm thinking about downloading Skype or downloading Telegram in the future for phone calls because, for some reason, Discord says I don't have a phone microphone when I do.

If you plan on telling me hello? Are you there? I will just end up hanging up if you constantly keep saying this on your microphone, because by then I will think that you don't really seem autistic-friendly or understand my sensory issues, and that makes me highly uncomfortable.

My friend and I just called on Google Chat as a temporary setup for Fall Guys, haha. I'd only have the Discord app installed on my phone; for some reason my microphone can't be recognized by Discord even though my microphone works on my phone and isn't damaged. Since nobody wants me on Skype just for voice calling, I will not be downloading the app anytime soon, haha.

You know, if I just had a Lorna Shore friend that could Lorna Shore with me every single day with JUST A FEW interests, and if you don't have A LOT of my interests checked off, that is fine with me, and I would be okay with that!

How did you get into Lorna Shore?

You can say this is a very odd encounter of how I heard about Lorna Shore, haha.

Sheer luck, sheer oddness, oddness enough on RS on Double XP, and we're no longer friends now. We stayed friends for over a month until this week in June, when he told me about the rally he joined, which somehow got into a divide between us both. But you might think that you really haven't heard of Lorna Shore till 2025? I'm telling the truth; if you don't believe me, then sorry for whoever thinks I'm lying. But yeah, I was on RS in May on Double XP at night and came across a group of people that were talking about deathcore bands, so I joined in, and I asked for recommendations for depressing deathcore lyrics. Pain Remains Part 1 by Lorna Shore was my ex-friend's recommendation.

No, we're not friends anymore because he told me he got involved in the recent protest that you see all over the news now.

Which I didn't know he was into these kinds of things because he was surprisingly someone I met on RS while doing Double XP. As I recently stated, I told him that I'm not interested in violent protest rallies or anything violent like that because he recommended that I should watch a video of the aftermath. I told him things like that aren't great with someone with mental health issues; he then told me that I should take care of my mental health first before getting into violent protest news. I told him, ""Um, what?"" I'm not interested in that kind of thing, so why would you say that to me?"" I don't need to hear that from you, and then I unfriended him, and then he unfriended me.

Fun facts for people wondering about Skye: I don't like violent horror movies. I can get into psychological horror such as Asian horror and Lovecraft-inspired horror, but that's as far as horror goes for me; it's just that I'm a very extremely sensitive person, and I only do psychological horror that is Asian or Lovecraft-inspired horror.

I'd also enjoy Lovecraft-inspired horror games that you can watch from Gab Smolders and CJU.

If you just type in Lovecraft on their YT channels, you can see there is a lot there, but I think CJU has a more expansive library than Gab Smolders.

Other video games I enjoy games that fall underneath psychological horror or just basic action/fighting games.

Silent Hill, Fatal Frame, RE, and DMC are games that I love!

I'd personally think that Gab Smolders is the reason why I love Silent Hill and Fatal Frame. Both YT creators are as real as you can get as legitimate people; the people will not screech for the whole playthrough just for views. You can really tell when a YT creator is being so fake with his or her screeching, pretending to make fake jump scares, jumping off their gaming chair, and screeching. Gab Smolders and CJU don't even do that, and with those two YT creators as well, both of them also give honest reviews as well as even positive criticism on how to make the game better and aren't afraid to say if the game is just so bad, haha.

Update on my RS account and my other post mentioning RS.

I should address as well that I'm going to also request a support ticket to get my RS account deleted as well, so any of my old posts talking about RuneScape, well, just forget about that, okay? Thanks. Just letting people know that the Redditors reading this, this isn't a joke, and I already punched in a support ticket to permanently delete my Jagex account off the system; I'm not going to cancel this.

Yes, I'd love to watch Let's Plays. An ex-friend of mine hated Let's Plays because he wanted to play games himself and not watch someone else, which, okay, valid point. I really don't want to say why we're ex-friends because his lifestyle was just way too busy for me, so I just deleted him to end contact myself. Yeah, that could be frowned upon by others, but why should I be friends with someone that takes 5 days to literally respond to a text message? I did tell him and his friend why I'm cutting contact, and they both didn't really have much to say about that.

I personally think God of War is a little bit too violent for me, to be honest. I understand why the God of War character has to kill all the gods, but, uh, I find that a little bit tasteless. To me, even though Kratos has a legitimate reason to kill all the gods, it is not a valid one; I just don't know if killing every single god is a bit too much for my taste/liking and an overabundance of violence. Not my kind of game, sorry.

What about Hitman?

To be honest, I think Hitman 3 is awesome, but I'm talking about the graphics being stellar and the story being extremely amazing. I thought the story was extremely strong, and I understood the story. Yakuza games are just heartbreaking. Yeah, Yakuza games are violent, but the story is heartbreaking. Idk, I may appear to be a tough, sassy cookie on the outside with some autistic spectrum spice, but on the inside I'm just like Jell-o, haha.

Now we should reel back on the topic and go back into partners.

You didn't contact me, but I'm not sure if I can message you because I'm a 23-27-year-old male, but we share a lot of interests, and I'm also a Lorna Shore fan that is wondering, can I still send out a message to you on the Discord social link after reading this post?

Yes, and that truthfully depends on the comfort level of how you feel once you read about how old I am. For me personally, how I think about a 23-27-year-old male messaging me is fine. I don't really see an issue with this. If you feel like I'm friendship material or even romance material, then yeah, that's fine, and if the Redditors thinking this are thinking, ""Yuck!"" You're super gross. Um, okay? I don't see what is wrong with the number 23-27 years old, once you see my gender and age, because apparently people have yet to find my gender or age on my profile, even though I've stated this in my pinned posts already, but before we begin on that, let me say something first about relationships.

What is your age?

32.

What is your gender?

Your question has already been answered in this post.

If you're not interested in reading this post, then I don't feel like answering your question if this is how you're going to act, and these kinds of people I don't want in my life. If anyone messages me on Discord and ask me questions that are already listed in the top two pinned posts, I'm not answering you because you basically just clicked on the Discord server invite link without even following the rules before clicking on the Discord server link, but yeah I'm not answering anymore if someone ask what my gender is, because I've already stated this already given in this post and if you don't want to read the post because that's not the kind of person you're on how to get to know people, then you're not the type of person I would like to invite my inner square circle of friends/get to know you, because I'm the type of person that that is something I simply truthfully disagree on with your methods on how you get to know people, sorry it's just my personal choice in life, thanks for tuning in about that.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/LornaShoreandMore/comments/1l70hqt/okay\_im\_back\_with\_a\_few\_announcements\_that\_should/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LornaShoreandMore/comments/1l70hqt/okay_im_back_with_a_few_announcements_that_should/)

Are you looking for a romance at this given moment?

Yes and no. 

For the last guy that was interested in me, he randomly and weirdly blocked me on Reddit, and he then deleted his Reddit account, which I have no idea why he did. We were having a normal conversations on Discord, the only thing that were an issue, were that he goes I'm sorry but I forgot to read about your pinned post that you were poly, it's really not my thing but I'm willing to see if poly could work for me or if I would be comfortable enough for poly, but my bad about forgetting to read your pinned posts about where you were talking about your poly relationships (what he is talking about is I made a pinned posts that clarifies a lot of what a poly relationships ethnics are for me, how I handle poly relationships and why I'm into poly relationships) What makes no sense is we were still conversing throughout the day while he were reading that pinned posts he missed, but what happened was I woke up to check my Discord notifications and I ended up with a block with no explanation of why he block me? I think, truthfully, that it is quite extreme to do to someone and then delete your Reddit account. I did talk to a few people about this on Discord, and a lot of people said this behavior is quite messed up. 

I'd want to make an account that I'm fine with new romance partners if he is willing to try out poly, and if he doesn't feel that me being poly is a good fit for him while looking for a partner for himself to meet his more physical needs, then that's okay with me. Truthfully, I'm fine with that. I don't see why we can't just be friends if things just end up as a ""no, this won't work out for me."" I don't and wouldn't understand why a given defriend or a block will have to happen over on Discord because something just didn't work out as planned.

He could've told me. I'm sorry, but after thinking about what I read in your poly pinned posts, sorry, but this isn't the lifestyle I'm looking for. I also don't think we will make a good match as friends either, and I think it's best if we parted ways, but thank you for the conversations, though. (Some Redditors have sent me a very similar message like this before and have deleted me on Discord without blocking me.) I simply and truthfully don't find that rude to say to me; it's honestly a nice, non-hostile way to end contact, but for him to block me on Discord and fully delete his Reddit account, uh, okay, that is a bit dramatic. 

Now, I need reassurance that IF you're interested in romance, I need to know if I don't have a block coming at me in the future because of this happening. While this is a recent happening, this isn't the first time, so IF you're interested in romance, I need to know that you're not going to block me. But yeah, that's my current romance disaster. I know, Redditors, you can have no comment; that's simply truthfully fine.

I'm curious, what did most Redditors say when you reached out to them by yourself in the past? What were the main popular responses that you always got? Did you get a lot of positive or negative messages? When you asked someone, ""Hi, how are you?"" What were the most Redditors' responses that you've received? 

Why are you messaging me? I don't want people messaging me (the Redditor doesn't have their chat disabled yet still has them open anyways, which is hysterical). I don't understand why you're messaging me, and who are you? Why am I messaging you? Because I read one of your posts or we have similar interests, why would I be messaging you if I didn't? Why would I message a Redditor a simple ""Hey, how are you doing?"" when the Redditor clicks on my profile and says, ""Oh, you have similar interests as me. I can see why you're messaging me; that makes sense."" You're too weird for me, sorry. You're asexual, and I'm not, so don't message me. Which, um, okay? For people that have MISSED my messages, you don't need to be asexual. Why would friendship even be affected by me being asexual? That is extremely weird when we're just friends, and I even got told nasty things by Redditors because I'm asexual and poly, which is a huge magnitude factor of why I've chosen that I will not message people anymore. There are also several context clues left and laid out on my profile on why I'm leaving as well; the majority of the reasons are in the pinned posts, and I'd have some trivia facts somewhere in my comments, but it's just better off if you spend time reading the pinned posts that offer that question instead of something that is just a minor detail of why I'm leaving Reddit, which isn't the whole globe of why I'm leaving.

With isn't the whole globe of why I'm leaving, I will give advice to Redditors: if you don't want random people trying to message you to be friends because of similar interests, please just turn off your chat requests and disable all messages. I think it is highly unnecessary to be extremely rude and aggressive when someone is just saying, ""Hi, how are you?"" We have this and this in common."" But I will say this is the middle dome base of why I'm leaving Reddit. If Redditors want all honesty, I will not stand to be treated this way. Sorry, but no thanks.

Wait a moment, this can't be true for every Redditor that you've messaged, could it have been this way?

Your question asked if the majority of my replies back were mainly positive or negative, and I'm making a statement that I was addressing the negatives or positives of which one was higher in the globe and what seldomly happens to me in the act of some kind of needle-in-the-haystack kid responses from Redditors. For the acts of kindness are a kind of needle in the haystack, responses are very less of the globe, and instead of the meanness, which is the majority of the globe.

You should've joined the asexual dating community and posted there; why not?

The Redditors on that subreddit are highly unfriendly to people that are poly; one Redditor even privately messaged me in the chat requests when I had my chat requests open at that given moment and told me. You know I find you quite a weirdo that you're asexual poly but are looking for poly partners that you're okay with having something more physical with another girl; you're weird. 

But speaking about partners, I never went into this in detail in these posts, and this post here is everything you read about my poly ethics and everything related to how I treat my poly partners. If you're interested in dating me or want to try out romance, this is the post you should read, but this isn't required for you to read at all to join the Discord server link; it's only this post, as I stated, and the other link later on in the day. I never addressed it in the poly posts, but I will say, though, my partners don't need to dress like they are into metalcore or deathcore; I'm okay with that, to be honest. But what I would like—and I can let this requirement slide if the guy has a lack of interest—is I prefer natural or dyed hair over gray; I'd also prefer a cool hairstyle as well. If all my partners like to wear are just joggers that are stylish or jeans with a graphic or band t-shirt, then sure. My partners don't need to be decked out with piercings or gothic clothing, etc. I don't really care about that, haha.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipsAreCursed/comments/1krtf61/did\_your\_message\_get\_missed\_because\_you\_dont\_log/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipsAreCursed/comments/1krtf61/did_your_message_get_missed_because_you_dont_log/)

But as I previously stated, I would like to have at least one of my partners who is into Lorna Shore and can Lorna Shore with me. I can mail him Lorna Shore items as well, and yeah, just read this post for further interest if you're interested in romancing me.

To be honest, I'm starting not to care about that anymore. I'm starting to think to myself, it's just video games, and I'm not going to make one of my partners buy a Switch Lite or a Nintendo Switch 1 just to play some Mario Kart 8 with me because he doesn't have a console, because that seems like an extremely high-end request to even ask one of my partners to do anyways. All I can really hope is that we will be able to talk about more than 5 subjects a day. I'd hope, and I really hope, that at least one of my partners would like Lorna Shore. I don't know how I would feel if I had a partner that would diss Lorna Shore. I'm still thinking if I'm iffy on that or not. Speaking of Lorna Shore, I would at least have one poly partner. At least one of my partners I would be able to purchase and mail Lorna Shore merch or the inspired album bracelet that I've shown on my profile before on Reddit. If I could have one partner out of my two or three poly partners, if I had any poly partners, then yeah, that would be okay with me, and I could be satisfied with that.

Discord server invite rules.

Can I already click on the Discord server invite link if I missed your messages?

Can I also skip this post entirely and go straight to clicking the Discord invite link?

Um, no, if you're okay with the things you read in this post, then yes, you can go ahead and click on the Discord server invite link, and then you can read the link that I posted in this post later on in the day.

I'm a Lorna Shore fan, and that means that I can instantly click on your Discord link without checking your profile, so that means I have the permission to completely skip this post and read your profile, right?

Um, no, that's awesome that you're a Lorna Shore fan just like me, which is super truthfully awesome, but wouldn't you want to get to know the bases of foundations of me first before blindly clicking on the Discord server invite link?

You can just read this post and read the link in this post at a later given time; it's truthfully simply fine. This post alone should give you some foundation bases of what is going on and why I've chosen to leave Reddit at this given moment.

I should also make a statement that if you've sent a friend request on Discord and you're waiting and waiting for the friend request to be accepted, I'm fine, and I'm just asleep. I also randomly fall asleep throughout the day just to doze off for 30 minutes or an hour and a half randomly, and yes, this happens every single day or every other day. It's nothing concerning; it's just light brain fog, which recovers after I doze off for that amount of time and get some caffeine in me. Problem simply and truthfully solved, haha. There is no need to express concern; I'm fine. It's just that my phone is sitting on my end table on mute or on vibrate, and nothing is going to make me hear my notifications go off haha. But yeah, I'm the type of person that doesn't tell people when I'm dozing off for the day or going to bed. I simply don't. I basically set my phone on my end table and just go pass out, haha.

If you're wondering what I'm doing offline on Reddit, then there is no need to be concerned. I'm just Lorna Shoring around, seeing what Pandora Shuffle has to offer for the day, evening, and night; YouTube; playing co-op Nintendo games; Fall Guys; and just chilling on Discord. Nothing is wrong; there is nothing to be concerned about, and I'm fine. I'd ask a kind favor of Redditors: don't report any of my posts. If you report my posts, that means I have to manually approve my posts again for others to see my posts. Please don't do that. Because I really can't have my pinned posts reported and manually approved when I've logged out of my Reddit account and I don't want to log in, so don't do that because reporting for a false concern when nothing is wrong in a sense of danger/worry is wrong; you're messing up my profile to where people won't be able to read my important posts if you report my account when I'm trying out this new method to meet people that fit my alignment in my pinned posts that I'm looking for and trying out this new method, so thanks for not reporting any of my posts while I'm gone. If you Redditors can do that for me while I'm away, thanks for tuning in.

For right now it's almost 6.00 a.m. and. I'm just finishing my Dr. Pepper Cherry Zero and going to go take a shower and then be up for another hour and a half. Yes, my sleep is a mess.

And he would finally understand what he had lost.  
  
  
Chapter 1  
Chloe Vance cornered Ava Chen in the powder room of the St. Regis.  
  
Her voice, smooth as poisoned honey, cut through the air.  
  
""Ava, darling. We need to talk about Ethan.""  
  
Ava's heart hammered.  
  
Ethan Gold, her husband. A secret husband, thanks to the war between their families, the Chens and the Golds.  
  
And Chloe, Ethan's first love, now his widowed stepmother.  
  
""What about Ethan?"" Ava tried to keep her voice steady.  
  
Chloe smiled, a flash of perfect white teeth.  
  
""He's mine, Ava. He always has been. But you're a persistent little thing.""  
  
She leaned closer, her expensive perfume cloying.  
  
""So, a wager. Ten chances. Ten public events, or significant private moments. Make Ethan publicly claim you, show real love. Not just a polite arm on your elbow.""  
  
Ava felt a chill. ""And if I don't?""  
  
""All ten failures?"" Chloe's eyes gleamed. ""You sign the divorce papers I'll have ready. No fuss, no fight. You just disappear from his life. And mine.""  
  
Ava thought of Ethan. His rare smiles, the stolen moments that felt like sunshine.  
  
She loved him. She truly believed she could win his heart, break through his cold exterior.  
  
""I accept,"" Ava said, her voice barely a whisper, but firm.  
  
Chloe's smile widened. ""Excellent. The annual Gold Foundation Gala is next week. Let that be your first test.""  
  
Ava's initial confidence was a fragile thing.  
  
At the Gala, she reached for Ethan's hand on the red carpet.  
  
He was a statue, his fingers stiff, pulling away subtly as photographers flashed.  
  
Later, she saw him in a quiet corner, deep in conversation with Chloe, who looked artfully distressed.  
  
Chloe caught Ava's eye and gave a tiny, triumphant smirk.  
  
One down. Nine to go.  
  
The failures piled up. A charity dinner, a weekend at his parents' estate (now Chloe's too, in a way), a business conference. Each time, Ethan was distant, his attention fixed on Chloe's feigned needs, her ""fragility.""  
  
Desperation gnawed at Ava. This was attempt number four.  
  
They were at the Gold family's desolate Hamptons beach house. Ethan was working, as usual.  
  
Ava had read about aph\*\*disiacs online. A tasteless powder.  
  
She slipped it into his whiskey, her hands trembling.  
  
She just wanted him to look at her, to touch her with something other than indifference.  
  
He took a sip, then another.  
  
A flush crept up his neck. He looked at her, a strange light in his eyes.  
  
For a moment, Ava's hope surged.  
  
Then, his expression hardened. He stood up, his chair scraping loudly.  
  
""What did you do?"" His voice was ice.  
  
Ava stammered, ""Nothing, I just...""  
  
""Don't lie to me, Ava."" He gripped her arm, his fingers like steel. ""You think you can trick me into... this?""  
  
He looked at her with pure disgust.  
  
""Pathetic.""  
  
The word struck her harder than a slap.  
  
He released her, turning his back. ""I'm going out.""  
  
""Ethan, please...""  
  
He didn't look back. He just walked out, leaving her alone in the vast, silent house.  
  
Later that night, Olivia, Ava's sister, sent her a link to a gossip site.  
  
Paparazzi photos. Ethan, looking concerned, ""comforting"" a tearful Chloe outside an exclusive Hamptons club.  
  
The caption read: ""Ethan Gold rushes to stepmother Chloe Vance's side after a trying day.""  
  
Ava stared at the screen, the image blurring through her tears.  
  
He left her, alone and humiliated, to rush to Chloe.  
  
The realization was a cold, heavy stone in her stomach. Chloe was his priority. Always.  
  
The next morning, Chloe called. Ava saw her name on the caller ID and almost didn't answer.  
  
""Darling Ava,"" Chloe purred. ""Did you have a lonely night? Ethan was such a comfort. He said the sea air was doing wonders for my nerves.""  
  
Ava felt sick. Chloe was gloating.  
  
""Four down, sweetie. Only six more public embarrassments before you sign those papers. I have them drafted already, you know. Very neat, very tidy.""  
  
Ava hung up, her hand shaking.  
  
She sank onto the cold tile floor of the beach house bathroom.  
  
Defeated. This attempt, this desperate, foolish act, had been a disaster.  
  
Her marriage felt like a hollow shell. What was she even fighting for?  
  
A man who looked at her with contempt?  
  
She remembered the first time she saw Ethan Gold.  
  
It was at a university lecture. He was a guest speaker, already a young titan in the real estate world.  
  
He wasn't handsome in a conventional way. He was sharp, intense, with eyes that seemed to see everything.  
  
There was an energy about him, a controlled power that fascinated her.  
  
She'd been a naive design student, full of romantic notions. He was different. He was a challenge.  
  
Then, a few months into their cautious, secret dating, Olivia had told her.  
  
""Ava, you need to know about Ethan Gold and Chloe Vance.""  
  
Olivia, ever the pragmatic lawyer, laid out the facts.  
  
Chloe had been Ethan's first serious girlfriend. A p\*\*sionate, tumultuous a\*\*air.  
  
Then, Chloe had shocked everyone by marrying Ethan's much older, incredibly wealthy father, Arthur Gold.  
  
""He still wears that silver watch Chloe gave him years ago,"" Olivia had said. ""The one she had engraved.""  
  
Ava had noticed the watch. Ethan never took it off.  
  
One evening, desperate to understand, Ava had gone to a charity event she knew Arthur and Chloe Gold would attend. Ethan was there too, ostensibly for business.  
  
From a shadowed alcove, she saw them.  
  
Chloe, beautiful and radiant, laughing up at Ethan.  
  
He wasn't looking at his father. He was looking at Chloe.  
  
Then, Chloe had leaned in, whispered something. Ethan's hand had gone to her waist, a brief, possessive touch.  
  
Chloe's eyes met Ava's across the crowded room, a flicker of triumph in them before she turned back to Ethan.  
  
Devastation washed over Ava. It was real. Their bond was real.  
  
Still, Ava had persisted.  
  
She told herself she could be better for Ethan than Chloe.  
  
She could offer him stability, genuine love, not the drama Chloe thrived on.  
  
She chased him, with little self-respect, she now admitted.  
  
She ignored the warning signs, the way he always kept a part of himself back.  
  
Then came the secret marriage.  
  
Their families, the Chens and the Golds, were locked in a bitter business rivalry that spanned generations.  
  
A public union was unthinkable.  
  
""We'll tell them when the time is right, Ava,"" Ethan had promised. ""When things calm down.""  
  
He'd slipped a simple gold band on her finger in a sterile courthouse office.  
  
No family, no friends. Just a shared secret.  
  
But the time was never right. His promises remained empty. He was always busy, always distant.  
  
He consistently rejected her attempts at intimacy, at building a real marriage.  
  
""Not now, Ava, I have an early meeting.""  
  
""I'm tired, Ava.""  
  
Sometimes, he'd look at her with a flicker of something unreadable, then turn away.  
  
He'd make her feel cheap for wanting her own husband.  
  
The hypocrisy was staggering, given what she knew about him and Chloe.  
  
Now, Arthur Gold was dead. Chloe was free, a wealthy widow.  
  
And she was openly, cruelly, playing her game with Ava.  
  
This bet, these ten chances, felt like Chloe tightening the noose.  
  
Ava had tried everything. S\*\*uctive lingerie, his favorite meals, trying to engage him in conversations about his work, her work, anything.  
  
He'd look through her, or worse, at her with that polite, chilling indifference.  
  
The memory of his face last night, the disgust, the single word: ""Pathetic.""  
  
That insult, more than anything, had cracked something deep inside her.  
  
His love, the love she'd pinned all her hopes on, wasn't just absent; it felt like it had never existed for her at all.  
  
He wasn't just emotionally stunted. He was actively cruel, using her.  
  
She was a shield. A placeholder. A secret to be managed, not a wife to be cherished.  
  
His public image was a carefully constructed facade. The driven, ascetic business leader.  
  
Underneath, he was a man tethered to a toxic past, to a woman who played him like a violin.  
  
A small, bitter part of Ava acknowledged the failure of this latest, desperate attempt.  
  
The thought of leaving, truly leaving, began to take root, a tiny, bitter seed.  
  
Chloe's voice echoed in her mind, ""Six more public embarrassments.""  
  
San Francisco. Her family was there. The Serene Collection had its headquarters there.  
  
It was an island of sanity in her churning world.  
  
But the bet wasn't over. Not yet. She had made a promise.  
  
  
Chapter 2  
Ethan Gold returned to the Hamptons beach house late the next morning.  
  
The air was still thick with the previous night's tension.  
  
Ava was usually up, making coffee, a forced cheerfulness about her.  
  
Today, the house was quiet. Too quiet.  
  
He found her in their bedroom, a suitcase open on the b\*d.  
  
""What are you doing?"" he asked, his voice neutral.  
  
Ava didn't look at him.  
  
She continued folding clothes, her movements precise, almost robotic.  
  
""Packing,"" she said.  
  
""Packing for what? We're here for another two days.""  
  
She finally turned, her eyes holding a new, unreadable expression.  
  
""I have a surprise for you, Ethan. It's related to my departure.""  
  
He frowned. He hated surprises, especially from Ava. They usually involved some emotional demand.  
  
""Don't be dramatic, Ava. If this is about last night...""  
  
""It's about everything, Ethan,"" she said, her voice flat. ""But don't worry. You'll like this surprise.""  
  
She went back to her packing.  
  
He watched her for a moment, a flicker of unease stirring within him.  
  
He dismissed it. Ava was always emotional. She'd get over it.  
  
Ava picked up a framed photo from the nightstand.  
  
It was from their secret wedding day, a rare shot where they both looked almost happy.  
  
She stared at it for a long moment, then walked to the tr\*\*h can and dropped it in.  
  
The sound of the frame hitting the plastic was louder than it should have been.  
  
Ethan's eyes narrowed. ""What was that?""  
  
""Just getting rid of old things,"" Ava said, not looking at him. ""Making space for the new.""  
  
He felt a strange pang. That photo... it was one of the few proofs of their union.  
  
""If you're still upset about last night,"" he began, trying a different tactic, ""I was harsh. We can talk about it. I'll... I'll make it up to you. We can go to that restaurant you like in the city when we get back.""  
  
It was a superficial offering, and he knew it.  
  
His phone buzzed. Chloe.  
  
He glanced at the screen. Her message was urgent. ""Ethan, darling, I need you. The press are hounding me about father's will. It's dreadful.""  
  
He sighed. ""I have to go. Chloe needs me.""  
  
He started for the door.  
  
""Wait,"" Ava said. Her voice was stronger now.  
  
He turned, impatient. ""What is it, Ava?""  
  
""I'm coming with you.""  
  
He stared at her. ""Don't be ridiculous. You know we can't be seen together like that. Especially not now, with Chloe dealing with Arthur's estate.""  
  
He was CEO of Gold Standard Enterprises. He had an image to maintain. Their marriage was a liability.  
  
""But I'm your wife, Ethan,"" Ava said, a strange calm in her voice. ""Shouldn't a wife support her husband when his family is in distress? Or is that role also reserved for Chloe?""  
  
Her logic was a deliberate echo of his own twisted justifications.  
  
He felt a surge of irritation. ""Fine. But stay in the car. And don't cause a scene.""  
  
She nodded, a small, almost imperceptible smile playing on her l\*ps.  
  
As they walked to his car, Ava noticed a small, velvet jewelry box on the passenger seat.  
  
It wasn't hers.  
  
""What's this?"" she asked, picking it up.  
  
Ethan snatched it from her. ""It's nothing. A gift for a business associate.""  
  
He avoided her eyes.  
  
Ava knew. It was for Chloe. Another token of his devotion.  
  
At Chloe's sprawling Hamptons estate, the scene was chaotic. Reporters, photographers.  
  
Ethan immediately went to Chloe, his arm around her shoulder, guiding her through the throng.  
  
He spoke to the press, his voice firm, protective of Chloe.  
  
Ava watched from the car, invisible, forgotten.  
  
She took out her phone and sent a quick telegram to her sister, Olivia, in San Francisco.  
  
""Phase one initiating. Need legal groundwork. A.""  
  
It was a small step, but it was a step towards her own future.  
  
Suddenly, there was a commotion.  
  
A protestor, someone who had lost money in one of Arthur Gold's ruthless deals, lunged at Chloe, shouting.  
  
Ethan reacted instantly, shielding Chloe, pushing her behind him.  
  
He was her protector. Her champion.  
  
Ava watched, a cold clarity settling over her.  
  
This was Ethan. This was her marriage.  
  
  
Chapter 3  
The protestor, a middle-aged man with wild eyes, spat at Ethan.  
  
""You're just like your old man! And her! She's a gold-digging wh\*\*e!""  
  
Ethan's face was a mask of fury.  
  
""Get him out of here,"" he snarled at his security.  
  
Then, to everyone's surprise, Ethan, who rarely drank in public and never before noon, grabbed a bottle of champagne from a nearby ice bucket.  
  
He uncorked it with a loud pop and poured a glass, handing it to Chloe.  
  
""For your nerves, my dear,"" he said, his voice loud enough for the reporters to hear.  
  
He then took a long drink directly from the bottle himself, a defiant gesture.  
  
It was a clear statement. He stood by Chloe. He would break his own rules for her.  
  
""Anyone who bothers Mrs. Vance again will answer to me personally,"" Ethan announced, his eyes sweeping over the crowd.  
  
He then turned, his arm securely around Chloe, and led her into the house.  
  
He didn't even glance towards the car where Ava sat. He had forgotten her completely.  
  
As he moved, his shoulder brushed hard against the car's side mirror.  
  
Ava, who had leaned forward slightly, felt a sharp pain as the mirror, jolted by the impact, swung inwards and struck her temple.  
  
Stars exploded behind her eyes.  
  
Ethan and Chloe disappeared inside.  
  
Ava touched her temple, her fingers coming away sticky with bl\*\*d.  
  
He hadn't even noticed. He hadn't seen her. He hadn't cared.  
  
She had endured so much for this man. The secret marriage, the constant loneliness, his coldness, Chloe's taunts.  
  
For what? For a love that was a mirage?  
  
Her devotion felt foolish, wasted.  
  
She fumbled in her purse for a tissue, pressing it to the cut.  
  
The bleeding wasn't severe, but the thr\*\*bing in her head was intense.  
  
She was alone. Again.  
  
She spent the night in the guest room of the beach house, tending to her wound, the silence of the house amplifying her desolation.  
  
The next morning, her phone rang. It was Chloe.  
  
Ava almost didn't answer, but a morbid curiosity made her press the accept button.  
  
""Ava, darling,"" Chloe's voice was bright, too bright. ""Are you feeling better? Ethan was so worried when he heard you weren't well.""  
  
A lie. Ethan hadn't contacted her.  
  
Then, Chloe's voice dropped, became more int\*\*ate. ""He stayed with me last night, you know. He said he couldn't leave me alone after that dreadful scene. He was so... attentive.""  
  
Ava could hear the rustle of sheets in the background, a low murmur that might have been Ethan's voice.  
  
Rage, cold and sharp, flooded through Ava.  
  
Chloe was deliberately tormenting her.  
  
Ava hung up.  
  
She sat there for a moment, trembling. Then, she picked up her phone again.  
  
She knew a reporter at a prominent gossip blog, someone who owed her a favor from an old interior design project.  
  
She typed out a message, attaching an anonymous tip about Chloe Vance's suspicious financial dealings related to Arthur Gold's estate, hinting at potential fraud. She included specific account numbers she'd once glimpsed on Arthur's desk when she'd been forced to attend a family dinner.  
  
It was a reckless, retaliatory act, born of pain and anger.  
  
Nothing happened immediately. The blog didn't publish anything.  
  
Two days later, back in New York, Ethan called. His voice was curt.  
  
""Ava, get to my office. Now.""  
  
He hung up before she could reply.  
  
The tone of his voice promised a storm.",2,1749812074.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

It was a slightly heavy one so I had borrowed my friend's car that day and somehow managed to carry it 3 floors down and into the car to transport it to my house.

I recently gave in my notice of resignation and when they gave me a checklist of items to return to their inventory management team, the coffee machine is not listed on it and I'm confused.

Did they not put it in the checklist because the coffee machine is for me to keep, or is it because they don't want to pay for the transportation charges?",1,1749812001.0,IndiaStartups,0,1.0,False
1lacw4u,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lacw4u,A Heartfelt Review of CPJ Before I Quit. (New Player),"**Greetings fellow Penguins, I am here with a bittersweet telling of a story that starts off around 7 days ago.**

Like many of you I found myself missing Club Penguin and the wonders it brought my childhood, so I went ahead and hopped on google / youtube searching for the most authentic experience I could find. After quickly stumbling upon CPJ, I noticed there was an event currently in place and it had got me very excited. ( The Medieval Party obviously) 

When I tried to make an account it said my email had already been registered; confused I looked through my email and found an old confirmation email of my apparent account's creation. ( Around a year ago I was again chasing nostalgia and I guess made an account but never used it. ) 

Upon resetting the password and logging in, I had zero coins, not a single clothing item, zero stamps, no igloo, and no friends added. (But I did have a full member badge, which was pretty cool) 

At this beginning stage I was a bit bummed out that I already had a display name that I had made awhile back and didnt like anymore, but I also didn't want to make a new account as I was told even getting a username verified takes along time. (That and I wouldn't have my full member badge anymore lol) So I decided to just use the account I already had. ( I also figured if I was a regular P# account I would be treated as a noob and / or ignored most the of time. ) 

*I guess everything above this line isn't really important I just felt like sharing.*

**Some accomplishments I wanted to list out that I was able to achieve within one week of playing are, but not limited to:**

* \-Helped around 20-30 penguins daily with their stamps. (Could be more but who really keeps track of helping people out lol)
* \-Completed all party quests
* \-Achieved the 30 penguin igloo party stamp ( my favorite. )
* \-Finally reached a score of 7055 on cart surfer after MANY countless / tiring attempts.
* \-Gained a total of 630,000 Coins from said attempts \^ (Was chasing 1 million but when double coin weekend ended I lost a bit of motivation.)
* \-Almost got to black belt (brown)
* \-Reached roughly 150 likes on my restaurant themed igloo.
* \-Around 60 likes on my normal, cozy home igloo.
* \-Spent around 140k on furniture for current igloos and future projects.
* \-Made around 45 genuine friends (not just spam adding)
* \-Got raided by pookies ( Just kidding this one I secretly hated)
* \-Got a postcard from Dot AND Baibee heep. (This achievement is silly but still cool as I suspected baibee heep to just be an afker (I was pleasantly surprised when proven wrong)
* \-Actually got a public chat response from Dot to my question about sandwiches, and what their ideal one would be, LOL.
* \-Introduced my brother, girlfriend and many friends to the platform.
* \-And the most important to me, I have had countless conversations with others that have lasted hours. Box dimension, coffee shop, pizza parlor, are all places I have sat at for HOURS willingly just chatting and having so much fun having pointless, or meaningful, or silly conversations with others that seem to share the same sentiment of reliving the nostalgia of a chat room we didnt fully get to appreciate at such a young age.

With all of that being said I quickly got comfortable with the idea that I would spend the foreseeable future on this platform and quickly got excited at the fact that it not only felt like club penguin again but that I was experiencing it in a whole new way.

CPJ is not only authentic to what its trying to replicate, but the community is wholesome; well rounded and it feels like a safe community with little to no bad apples. Everyone I have met so far has been incredibly welcoming, and the players I interact with never fail to keep the OG feel alive; whether it be by sending me random post cards, tracking me down in random rooms, offering to help with stamps, or committing to whatever bit their costume is based around. ( I love the characters of blizzard lol ) Overall out of all the cpps I had previously tried in my life (around 2 or 3) this has been the most authentic one. It has actually kept me wanting to put in the countless hours I had as a child.

  
And just like that, after some shameless igloo advertising in welcome room, and spam farting on mascots, or even calling rage quitters in the dojo bad at the game; I was for whatever reason ***muted***.

  
The only reason I noticed I had gotten muted on CPJ was because I had emailed the support team about potentially changing my name to something else because of the situation I explained earlier on this post; and after waiting awhile for a response I was curious and went to the support page to see if pending tickets are visible; and while doing so I saw ( MUTED: YES) listed on my account.

I immediately thought this was some error because I had just been an hour prior to this talking in the box dimension and having fluent conversations with others; but upon asking my brother to hop online and check for me I was indeed muted. Indicating that it was fresh.

  
Initially this wasnt something that worried me as I was confident it was some sort of auto moderation triggered by the amount of spamming I was doing advertising my igloo, or whatever the case was so I immediately contacted support explaining everything and have yet to receive an answer.

  
Normally in situations like this (which are rare for me) I wouldn't be apposed to just waiting and having patience, but after talking to others in the community, looking at old reddit posts and discord messages and contacting others that have been muted before; I have been mainly told by the majority of people I speak to that the mute is more than likely permanent. 

It's been some time now and after hearing some of the stories from others and from what apparently seems to be a dwindling staff team ( Just from what ive heard) I have quickly lost any hope in receiving a reversal on their decision for muting me, none the less a response as to why / or how long. 

\^This is in no way me throwing shade at the staff team, I understand running a private server with no public funding is a hard job to keep alive solely as a passion project. Not only that but I respect them for making what seems to be a perfect replica of club penguin, I can imagine with the party and the issues with the tower it will probably be along time if I ever receive a response thats real, let alone even knowing if ill ever be unmuted.

To finish this off im going to leave you guys with some screenshots, showing off what I am really proud of before logging off. 

And to anyone asking why I don't just make a new account ( I assume those comments will be posted ) : I feel as if I even attempted to make around the same amount of coins, collect the same stamps, and desperately try to host igloo events like I did but on a new account, I will get burned out very fast. The past week or so has been solely grinding and getting to a stable point because I felt as if I was late to the party and was behind. After getting all of these accomplishments (which yes there were many more to be made for sure) I wanted nothing but to finally enjoy club penguin for what it is, a chat room.

Aswell as I'm sure making a new account because I was muted is a form of ban evading. ( I dont want to grind on a new account just to quickly be re muted because it was detected as an alt. )

  
Obviously losing the ability to speak to others i guess to me personally defeats the entire purpose of the game, I mean heck.... I can't even order some coffee anymore :(

With that being said it was fun, and as much as I would've loved to become a regular It seems impossible to do so comfortably without being able to talk let alone use an emote or interact with mascots in chat.

  
Cheers, Waddle on fellas.

1lacvwf,https://youtu.be/08gNFk1iV5Q,3 Very Scary TRUE Night Shift at a Gas Station Horror Stories,"# ""Off Highway 41"":

I work the night shift at a gas station off a quiet highway, the kind of place where hours crawl by with nothing but the hum of fluorescent lights and the occasional trucker stopping for coffee. It’s just me, a small convenience store, and a couple of pumps outside. The job is boring, but it pays, and I’m used to the silence. Most nights, I stock shelves, watch the security monitors, and wait for morning. But one night, everything changed.It was around 2 a.m., and I hadn’t seen a customer in hours. The store was dead quiet, just the buzz of the cooler in the back. I was behind the counter, flipping through a magazine, when the bell above the door jingled. I looked up, expecting a tired driver, but instead, a man walked in. He was tall, wearing a dark hoodie pulled low over his face. His hands were stuffed in his pockets, and he moved slowly, like he was studying the place. My stomach tightened. Something about him felt off.“Hey, welcome,” I said, trying to sound normal. “Need help finding anything?”He didn’t answer. He just wandered down the snack aisle, his head tilted, like he was listening for something. I glanced at the security monitor. His reflection showed him standing still, facing the camera, but his face was hidden under the hood. My heart beat faster. I told myself he was just another weird late-night customer. Happens sometimes.I busied myself wiping the counter, keeping him in the corner of my eye. He grabbed a bag of chips but didn’t come to the register. Instead, he walked to the back, near the coolers, and just stood there. Minutes passed. I could feel my pulse in my throat. The silence was heavy, broken only by the faint hum of the lights. I cleared my throat.“Sir, you ready to check out?” I called, my voice louder than I meant.He turned his head slowly, like he’d forgotten I was there. “Not yet,” he said, his voice low and raspy, like he hadn’t spoken in days. He didn’t move. Just stood by the cooler, holding the chips, staring at the floor.I forced a smile. “Alright, take your time.”My hands were sweaty. I glanced at the phone under the counter. The police were a call away, but I didn’t want to overreact. He hadn’t done anything wrong. Not yet. I checked the monitor again. He was gone from the frame. My breath caught. I leaned forward, scanning the other cameras. Nothing. The aisles looked empty. My eyes darted to the door. The bell hadn’t rung. He was still inside.I grabbed the baseball bat we kept under the counter, just in case. My boss had shown it to me on my first day, half-joking, but now it felt like a lifeline. I stepped out from behind the counter, gripping it tight. “Sir?” I called, my voice shaking. No answer. I moved toward the aisles, my sneakers squeaking on the tile. The store felt too big, too quiet.I peeked down the snack aisle. Empty. The cooler aisle. Empty. My heart was pounding so hard I could hear it. I turned toward the bathroom in the back, the only place I hadn’t checked. The door was cracked open, the light off. I tightened my grip on the bat and pushed the door with my foot. It creaked open. Nothing but darkness. I flicked on the light. Empty.I let out a shaky breath and turned back to the store. That’s when I saw him. He was standing at the counter, right where I’d been, holding the bag of chips. His hood was still up, his face shadowed. I froze. He shouldn’t have gotten there without me seeing him. The bell hadn’t rung. The cameras hadn’t shown him move.“You okay?” he asked, his voice calm, almost mocking. He tilted his head, and I caught a glimpse of his eyes—dark, unblinking, like they were boring into me.“Yeah,” I lied, stepping back toward the counter, the bat still in my hand. “Just checking the store. You ready to pay?”He didn’t move. “You alone here?” he asked, his voice soft but heavy, like it carried a threat.My mouth went dry. “My coworker’s in the back,” I said, hoping it sounded convincing. There was no coworker. It was just me until 6 a.m.He nodded slowly, like he didn’t believe me. “Must get lonely,” he said, setting the chips on the counter. His hand moved slow, deliberate, and I saw a flash of something metallic in his pocket. A knife? My stomach dropped.I forced myself to stay calm, scanning the chips with shaking hands. “That’s $2.49,” I said, my voice barely steady.He reached into his pocket, and I braced myself, ready to swing the bat. But he pulled out a crumpled five-dollar bill and slid it across the counter. His fingers were long, pale, and smudged with dirt. I grabbed the bill, avoiding his touch, and fumbled for change. He didn’t take it. He just stood there, staring.“Keep it,” he said, picking up the chips. He turned toward the door but stopped, looking back at me. “You should lock the door at night. Never know who’s out there.”My blood ran cold. He walked out, the bell jingling as the door swung shut. I rushed to the door and locked it, my hands trembling. I watched him through the glass as he walked to the edge of the lot, where a beat-up truck was parked. He didn’t get in. He just stood there, facing the store, his hood still up. I couldn’t see his face, but I knew he was watching me.I grabbed the phone and dialed 911, my voice shaking as I told the operator about the man, the truck, the way he’d acted. They said they’d send a car, but it’d take 20 minutes. The highway was too far out. I kept the bat in my hand and watched the monitors. The truck didn’t move. He didn’t move.Then the power flickered. The lights buzzed, dimmed, and came back on. My heart stopped. I checked the monitors again. The truck was still there, but he was gone. I scanned every camera, every angle. Nothing. The bell hadn’t rung. The door was still locked.I backed away from the counter, clutching the bat, my eyes darting to every corner of the store. The coolers hummed. The lights buzzed. Then I heard it—a faint scrape, like metal on tile, coming from the back. My breath hitched. I wanted to run, but the only way out was the front door, and his truck was still there.“Sir?” I called, my voice barely a whisper. No answer. The scrape came again, closer now, from the stockroom. I crept toward the door, the bat raised, my heart hammering. I pushed the door open. The stockroom was dark, the single bulb flickering. Boxes were stacked high, casting long shadows. I stepped inside, my sneakers silent on the concrete.Then I saw it—a flash of movement behind a stack of boxes. I swung the bat, hitting nothing but air. A can rolled across the floor, clattering. I froze, my breath shallow. “Who’s there?” I said, louder now.No answer. But I heard breathing, slow and heavy, from the corner. I backed up, my back hitting the wall. The lights flickered again, and for a split second, I saw him—standing in the shadows, his hood up, his eyes locked on mine. He didn’t move. He didn’t speak. He just stared.I bolted for the door, slamming it shut behind me. I grabbed the phone again, my hands shaking so bad I could barely dial. The operator said the police were five minutes out. I locked myself in the small office behind the counter, clutching the bat, watching the monitors. The truck was still there. The stockroom camera showed nothing but static.I waited, every second stretching into forever. The lights flickered again, and the monitors went black. My heart was in my throat. I heard the scrape again, closer now, right outside the office door. I gripped the bat, tears stinging my eyes, and whispered to myself, “Just stay calm. Just stay calm.”Then the door handle jiggled. Slow at first, then faster, like someone was trying to force it open. I held my breath, ready to swing. The jiggling stopped. Silence. Then a low, raspy voice came through the door.“You should’ve locked the back door.”My blood froze. I hadn’t checked the back door. The stockroom had a delivery entrance. I’d forgotten to lock it. I wanted to scream, but my voice was gone. The handle jiggled again, harder this time. I backed into the corner, the bat shaking in my hands.Then I heard sirens. Red and blue lights flashed through the windows. The jiggling stopped. I heard footsteps, fast, fading away. I stayed in the office, too scared to move, until the police knocked on the door. They searched the store, the stockroom, the lot. The truck was gone. The back door was wide open.They found the bag of chips on the stockroom floor, unopened, next to a pocketknife. The police said I was lucky. They’d seen guys like him before—drifters, looking for easy targets at lonely gas stations. They never caught him. I quit the next day. I couldn’t go back. Every time I close my eyes, I see his face in the shadows, hear his voice through the door, and wonder what would’ve happened if the police hadn’t shown up when they did.

  


# ""The Man at Pump Six"":

I work the night shift at a small gas station off a lonely highway in a quiet town. It’s a rundown place, with four rusty pumps outside, a convenience store lit by flickering fluorescent lights, and a cramped back room with a cot and a flickering bulb. The air smells of stale coffee and motor oil, and the counter is scratched from years of use. I took the job because I needed the money for bills, but the loneliness gets to me. Most nights, it’s just me, the hum of the cooler, and a crackling radio playing old country tunes. I keep a flashlight under the counter and a cheap coffee maker in the corner for long hours. Last night, though, I wish I’d called in sick.It was 10 PM when I started my shift. I locked the door behind me, flipped the “Open” sign, and checked the register. The cash drawer stuck, as always, and I had to jiggle it open. I restocked the candy aisle, the crinkle of wrappers loud in the empty store, and wiped down the counter, smearing streaks of dust. The radio played softly, a song about lost love, and I settled into my stool, scrolling through my phone. The lot outside was dark, the pumps glowing faintly under their metal canopies. No cars, no people—just silence.Around 12:30 AM, the bell above the door jingled, sharp and sudden. I looked up, and my stomach dropped. A tall, gaunt man shuffled in, his boots scuffing the linoleum. His flannel shirt was torn, stained with dark patches—blood, I realized, my throat tightening. His hands were worse, smeared red, with dirt caked under his nails. His face was pale, almost gray, and his eyes were wide, darting like he was looking for something. He grabbed a bottle of water from the cooler, the glass door thumping shut, and walked to the counter.“Evening,” I said, my voice shaky. I forced my hands to stay still as I straightened a stack of receipts. “Just the water?”He nodded, staring at the counter, not at me. His fingers twitched as he fished a crumpled five-dollar bill from his pocket. The bill was damp, leaving a faint red smudge on my hand when I took it. I scanned the bottle, the beep loud in the silence, my heart pounding.“That’s $2.50,” I said, trying to smile. My lips felt stiff.He slid the bill across, his hand trembling. I noticed a cut on his knuckle, fresh and oozing. I handed him his change, coins clinking in my shaky palm. He looked up then, his eyes locking onto mine, bloodshot and unblinking.“Don’t worry,” he said, his voice low, raspy, like he’d been shouting. “It’s not my blood.”My breath caught. I opened my mouth, but no words came. He turned, his boots squeaking, and walked out, the bell jingling. I rushed to the window, watching him disappear past the pumps into the darkness. No car, no sound—just gone. My hands were clammy, and his words echoed in my head. I checked the door lock twice, my fingers fumbling, and tried to focus on the radio, but the music sounded wrong now, too cheerful.By 1:30 AM, I was still jumpy. I kept glancing at the windows, expecting to see his face pressed against the glass. That’s when I noticed a figure at pump number 6. He stood by a beat-up sedan, its paint chipped and windows tinted. He wasn’t pumping gas, wasn’t checking his phone—just standing, staring straight at the store. At me. He wore a hoodie, the hood up, shadowing his face. His hands were stuffed in his pockets, and his posture was odd, stiff, like a mannequin. His head tilted slightly, and I swear his eyes caught the pump’s light, glinting like an animal’s.I leaned closer to the window, my breath fogging the glass. He didn’t move. My skin prickled, and I grabbed the intercom mic, my thumb slippery on the button.“Hey, you need help out there?” I said, my voice echoing outside.No response. He just kept staring, his head tilting further, almost unnaturally. I tried again, louder.“Bathroom key? Or do you need anything else?”Nothing. Five minutes passed, then ten, then fifteen. He didn’t budge, his gaze never wavering. I paced behind the counter, my sneakers squeaking on the floor. The register screen glowed faintly, showing 1:45 AM. I thought about calling the cops, but what could I say? A guy’s standing there, creeping me out? I grabbed a pen and started doodling on a receipt, trying to calm down, but my hands shook, making jagged lines.By 2:00 AM, he was gone. The sedan was still there, parked crooked, but the man had vanished. I checked the security monitor, a grainy black-and-white screen in the corner. It showed nothing but the empty lot. I let out a shaky breath, my shoulders loosening, but my heart still raced. I told myself he’d walked off, maybe to another station, but the silence felt heavier now, like it was hiding something.At 2:30 AM, I heard a faint hum, like a scooter or a small motorcycle. I looked out and saw a figure circling the lot on a battered scooter, its engine sputtering. He wore a dark jacket and a helmet, the visor down, hiding his face. He slowed near the door, revving the engine loudly, then sped up and circled again. My chest tightened. I gripped the counter, watching him loop around, closer each time. He stopped right outside the entrance, his scooter idling with a low growl. He got off, his movements jerky, and yanked on the door handle. The glass rattled hard, the lock straining.“Hey!” I shouted, stepping back, my voice cracking. “We’re closed for walk-ins after midnight!”He didn’t answer. He pulled again, harder, the doorframe creaking. I stumbled back, my hip hitting the counter, knocking over a display of gum. He pressed his helmet against the glass, the visor reflecting the store’s lights like a blank, black mirror. I couldn’t see his eyes, but I felt them, cold and heavy. Then he turned, climbed back on his scooter, and sped off, the hum fading into the night.I was shaking, my breath coming in short gasps. I grabbed my phone, my fingers clumsy, and almost dialed 911. But I stopped. What if he came back? What if he was watching? I checked the locks again, my hands sweaty, and moved to the back room, closing the door. The cot smelled musty, and the single bulb flickered, casting shadows on the cinderblock walls. I sat there, clutching my phone, trying to slow my breathing.At 3:00 AM, the lights went out. The whole station plunged into darkness, the cooler’s hum dying, the radio cutting off mid-song. My heart leapt into my throat. I fumbled for the flashlight under the counter, dropping it twice before I got it on. The beam shook as I pointed it at the windows, the glass reflecting the light back at me.Then I saw them. Two figures, standing just outside the windows. The blood-covered man and the staring man from the pump. They weren’t moving, just standing there, their faces pressed against the glass. The blood-covered man’s eyes were wild, his lips curled into a faint, twisted smile. Blood smeared the window where his hands pressed, leaving streaks. The other man’s hood was still up, his head tilted at that same unnatural angle, his eyes glinting in the flashlight’s beam. My knees buckled, and I dropped the flashlight, the beam spinning across the floor.I scrambled to the back room, my sneakers slipping on the linoleum. I locked the door, my hands trembling so bad I could barely turn the bolt. I crouched in the corner, next to the cot, my phone clutched to my chest. Thumps echoed from the store—slow, deliberate bangs on the glass. Then I heard scratching, like nails dragging across the window. My stomach churned, and I bit my lip to keep from crying out.The banging stopped, but footsteps started—heavy, uneven, circling the building. They crunched on the gravel outside, slow and deliberate, like they were looking for a way in. I dialed 911, my fingers shaking so much I misdialed twice.“911, what’s your emergency?” the operator’s voice was calm, too calm.“Someone’s trying to get into the gas station,” I whispered, my voice barely audible. “Two men, outside, banging on the door. One’s covered in blood.”“Stay calm,” she said. “Where are you now?”“Back room,” I said, my teeth chattering. “Please, send someone fast.”“Officers are on their way,” she said. “Stay where you are. Keep the line open.”I huddled there, the phone pressed to my ear, listening to every sound. The footsteps stopped, then started again, closer now, near the back door. Something scraped against it, metal on metal, like a tool or a knife. My breath hitched, and I covered my mouth, afraid they’d hear me. The operator’s voice was a faint hum, telling me to stay calm, but my heart was pounding so loud I could barely hear her.Minutes stretched on, endless. The scraping stopped, and the silence was worse. I kept the flashlight off, afraid the light would leak under the door. My legs cramped from crouching, but I didn’t move. I kept seeing their faces in my mind—the blood-covered man’s smile, the hooded man’s tilted head.Finally, I heard sirens, faint at first, then louder. Red and blue lights flashed through the cracks in the door, painting the walls. I stayed put, my body frozen, until a loud knock shook the door.“Police! Anyone in there?” a deep voice called.I stumbled to my feet, my legs wobbly, and opened the door. Two officers stood in the store, their flashlights sweeping the darkness. One was burly, with a stern face and a hand on his holster. The other was younger, his eyes wide, clutching his flashlight like a lifeline.“You okay?” the burly one asked, his voice gruff.I nodded, my throat too tight to speak. “They were outside,” I managed. “Two men. One had blood on him, the other was staring.”They searched the lot, their boots crunching on gravel. The younger officer checked the security monitor, but the power outage had killed the feed. The burly one flipped the breaker in the back, and the lights flickered on, harsh and bright. They found nothing—no sedan, no scooter, no blood on the windows, no trace of anyone.“Breaker tripped,” the burly officer said, frowning. “Could’ve been a power surge. You sure about what you saw?”“I’m sure,” I said, my voice trembling. “They were right there, pressing on the glass.”The younger officer glanced at the windows, his face pale. “We’ll file a report,” he said. “You got someone to cover your shift?”“Yeah,” I said, my hands still shaking. “I’m done here.”I quit that night. I grabbed my jacket, left the keys on the counter, and walked out, the bell jingling one last time. The cops offered to drive me home, but I just wanted to get away. I keep seeing their faces—the blood-covered man’s wild eyes, the hooded man’s glinting stare. I don’t know who they were or what they wanted, but I feel them still, out there, watching, waiting for another night when I’m alone.

  


# ""2 A.M."":

I’ve been working the night shift at this gas station for six months. It’s a small, rundown place on the edge of town, tucked between a dark stretch of highway and a patch of overgrown weeds. The fluorescent lights buzz constantly, flickering every few hours, casting shadows on the faded linoleum floor. The air smells of stale coffee and motor oil, and the ancient radio behind the counter crackles with static, barely picking up the local country station. I spend most nights alone, ringing up energy drinks, cigarettes, and gas for truckers or late-night stragglers. There’s a tiny TV mounted in the corner, but the reception’s so bad it’s mostly snow. I keep a worn paperback or a crossword puzzle to pass the time, enjoying the quiet. But last week, that quiet turned into something I’ll never forget.It started with a regular customer I call Joe. He’s in his mid-forties, with a weathered face, deep lines around his mouth, and bloodshot eyes that always look like he hasn’t slept in days. His denim jacket is frayed at the cuffs, and his boots are caked with dirt, like he’s been walking through fields. He’d come in around 2 a.m. most nights, always buying the same thing: black coffee in a styrofoam cup and a pack of Marlboros. He’d make small talk—about the price of gas or how slow the nights were—and I’d nod along, happy for the brief company. He seemed harmless, just another lonely soul drifting through. But two weeks ago, something changed.That first night, the bell above the door jingled, and I looked up from restocking the candy aisle. Joe walked in, but his steps were slower, heavier, like he was dragging his feet on purpose. His hands were shoved deep in his pockets, and he didn’t head for the coffee machine like usual. Instead, he stood near the chip rack, staring at it without touching anything. The silence stretched on, broken only by the hum of the cooler. I straightened up, brushing my hands on my apron, my gut telling me something was off.“Everything okay, Joe?” I asked, keeping my tone friendly, though my pulse quickened.He turned his head slowly, his eyes locking onto mine. They were wide, unblinking, like he was staring through me. “You shouldn’t be here alone,” he said, his voice low and gravelly, almost a whisper. My stomach twisted, and I felt a prickle of sweat on my neck. I forced a smile, trying to act normal.“Just doing my job,” I said, moving behind the counter, putting the scratched plexiglass between us. He didn’t move, just kept staring, his hands still in his pockets. After what felt like forever, he shuffled to the coffee machine, poured his usual cup, and grabbed his smokes. He slid exact change across the counter without a word, his fingers brushing the edge of the register. I watched him walk out, his silhouette disappearing into the darkness beyond the pumps. My heart was pounding, but I told myself he was just tired, maybe having a rough day.The next night, he was back, same time, same heavy steps. I was wiping down the counter with a damp rag, the smell of cleaning spray sharp in my nose. The radio was playing some old Johnny Cash song, but it kept cutting out. The bell rang, and Joe walked in, his jacket hanging loose on his frame. This time, he didn’t go for coffee. He wandered the aisles, picking up random items—a bag of Doritos, a cheap lighter, a can of dip—then putting them back with slow, deliberate movements. Every few seconds, his head would turn toward me, his eyes catching mine before I could look away. My hands tightened on the rag, my throat dry.“Looking for something specific?” I called out, trying to sound casual, though my voice cracked slightly.He stopped in the middle of the aisle, holding a can of Coke, his fingers tapping against the aluminum. “They’re watching me,” he said, not looking at me. “They’re always watching.” His voice was flat, like he was talking about the price of bread. My skin prickled, and I glanced at the security camera monitor, its grainy feed showing nothing but empty aisles and the parking lot.“Who’s watching?” I asked, my voice barely above a whisper. I didn’t really want to know, but the silence was worse.He didn’t answer. He just set the can back on the shelf with a soft clink and walked out, the bell jingling sharply behind him. I hurried to the door and locked it, my hands trembling. I wasn’t supposed to lock up until closing, but I didn’t care. I grabbed the phone under the counter and dialed my boss, my fingers fumbling over the buttons. He didn’t answer, just voicemail. I hung up, my breath shaky, telling myself Joe was just acting strange, maybe stressed or on something. But the way his eyes had fixed on me, unblinking, stayed in my head all night.Over the next few nights, it got worse. Joe came in every shift, always around 2 or 3 a.m. He’d linger longer each time, pacing the aisles or standing by the coffee machine, muttering to himself. I caught fragments of his words—things like “they know” or “not safe.” His face looked paler each night, his eyes more sunken, like he hadn’t slept in weeks. I started keeping the baseball bat we had under the counter closer, my fingers brushing its worn handle whenever he was in the store. I checked the locks obsessively, made sure the back door was bolted, and kept my phone in my pocket, ready to dial 911.One night, I was restocking the cooler, the cold air chilling my arms as I arranged energy drinks. The bell rang, and my heart sank. Joe walked in, his boots louder than usual, like he wanted me to hear him coming. He didn’t wander this time. He went straight to the counter, leaning over it, his hands flat on the plexiglass. I stood up slowly, my mouth dry, the can of Red Bull in my hand forgotten.“You ever feel like you’re not safe?” he asked, his voice so quiet I barely heard it. His breath smelled of stale cigarettes and something sour. His eyes were locked on mine, and I noticed his hands were trembling slightly, his knuckles white against the counter.“I’m fine,” I said, my voice shaking. I stepped back, bumping into the cigarette rack behind me. “You need anything tonight, Joe?”He leaned closer, his face inches from the plexiglass. “I know things about you,” he said, his voice slow and deliberate. “Things you don’t want people knowing.” My blood ran cold. I had no idea what he meant—my life was boring, just work and home—but the way he said it, like he’d been watching me, made my stomach churn.“Please, just tell me what you want,” I stammered, my hand sliding toward the panic button under the counter, hidden behind a stack of receipts.He smiled, a slow, crooked smile that didn’t touch his eyes. Then, before I could react, he reached over the counter and grabbed my wrist. His grip was tight, his fingers cold and rough. I gasped, trying to pull back, but he held on, his eyes never leaving mine. “Don’t scream,” he said, his voice calm, almost soothing. “I don’t want to hurt you. Not yet.”I yanked my arm free, my heart slamming against my ribs. “Get out,” I said, my voice trembling but loud. “Get out now.”He stared at me for a long moment, his smile fading. Then he turned and walked out, the bell jingling like a mockery of normalcy. I locked the door, my hands shaking so badly I fumbled the key. I pressed the panic button, sank to the floor behind the counter, and hugged my knees, trying to breathe. The police came within ten minutes, their flashlights sweeping the parking lot. I told them everything—Joe’s words, his grip, his eyes. They took notes, said they’d look for him, but I could tell they thought it was just a weird guy, not a real threat. They didn’t find him that night.I almost quit, but rent was due, and I couldn’t afford to walk away. So I went back, promising myself I’d be smarter. I kept the door locked unless a customer was at the pump, checked the cameras every few minutes, and made sure the back door was secure. I even started parking my car closer to the entrance, just in case I needed to run. But nothing prepared me for last night.It was 3 a.m., and I was sorting receipts, the radio playing some faint song I didn’t recognize. The store was dead quiet, the only sound the buzz of the lights. Then I heard a thud against the front door. My head snapped up, and there was Joe, his face pressed against the glass, his breath fogging it up. His eyes were wild, his mouth twisted into that crooked smile. He banged on the door again, hard enough to make the frame shake.“Let me in,” he shouted, his voice rough through the glass. My heart stopped. The door was locked, but it felt flimsy, like one good kick could break it. I ducked behind the counter, my hands fumbling for the phone. Another thud, louder, and I heard the glass rattle. “I know you’re in there!” he yelled.I peeked over the counter, my breath catching. He was holding a gun, tapping it against the glass, the metal glinting under the fluorescent lights. “You can’t hide,” he said, his voice dropping to that eerie calm. “I just want to talk.” He started pacing in front of the door, the gun loose in his hand, his eyes scanning the windows like he was looking for a weak spot.I pressed the panic button, my fingers trembling so badly I hit it twice. My breath was loud, my vision blurring with tears. I grabbed the baseball bat, clutching it to my chest, my palms slick with sweat. The banging stopped, and for a moment, I thought he’d left. Then I heard a new sound—a rattle at the back door. My stomach dropped. I’d forgotten to double-check it that night.I crept toward the back, the bat raised, my heart pounding so hard I thought I’d pass out. The rattle turned into a loud bang, like he was slamming his shoulder against the door. The metal creaked, and I imagined it giving way, Joe stepping through with that gun. I backed away, my eyes darting between the front and back doors. Another bang, then silence. I held my breath, listening.The front door rattled again, harder this time. I realized he was circling the building, testing every entrance. My legs felt weak, but I forced myself to stay low, moving back to the counter. I whispered, “Stay calm, stay calm,” but my voice was shaking, and the bat felt useless in my hands.Then, headlights flashed across the windows, bright and sudden. A siren wailed, growing louder. I heard Joe shout something, his voice sharp, then the crunch of boots on gravel, running. I stayed crouched, too scared to move, until a cop’s voice cut through the silence. “Police! Open the door!”I crawled to the front, my hands shaking as I unlocked it. Two officers stepped in, their radios crackling. I told them everything, my words tumbling out. They searched the lot, the pumps, the back alley. Joe was gone, but they found his truck a mile down the road, abandoned in a ditch. The gun was inside, loaded. They said he had a record—arrests for harassment, trespassing, and some mental health holds. He wasn’t supposed to have a weapon. They promised to keep looking, but their faces said they weren’t sure they’d find him.I haven’t gone back to the gas station. I can’t. Every time I close my eyes, I see Joe’s face against the glass, hear his voice saying he knows things about me. I keep the lights on at home now, check the locks three times before bed. I’m looking for a new job, something in an office, somewhere with people, during the day. I used to think night shifts were peaceful, a chance to be alone with my thoughts. Now I know the truth. Some dangers don’t need shadows or ghosts to scare you. They just need someone like Joe, waiting in the dark.",1,1749811954.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

Daisy and Carter traveled up the colossal tower through the elevator. Daisy could tell that her beloved was still a bit nervous as she saw him vigorously rubbing his chin. But as she gently took his hand, it cleared up, replaced by a smile feeling her familiar touch. However, the elevator soon stopped, forcing her to release him as the door opened, revealing Gancelot in his armor, still concealing his face underneath his helmet.

“Greetings, Damara, General Carter.”

“Good to see you again, vice-commander Gancelot,” Daisy said.

“And the same to you. Please follow me to the meeting room.”

The couple followed behind Gancelot, allowing him to guide them through the corridors. They soon arrived in the meeting room, joining their new colleagues, the other three United Planets generals. It was a circular chamber at the very top of the tower approximately three hundred square feet in diameter adorned with glass windows, giving the golden sunlight passage in. The generals sat around a round table in the center of the room. Orion stood at the head of the table with Gancelot beside him.

Daisy quickly took note of their three new comrades. Each of the generals was a different species native to the varying corners of the United Planets. Immediately, Orion’s words about his and Everton’s friendship echoed through her mind. With Carter from Earth, a planet on the Northern end of the territory, they had representation from all four cardinal directions. She quickly surmised that it must have been a symbolic and practical gesture. Orion wanted the best fighters, drawing from all their people to show that everyone was equal and worthy of protection, promoting unity in the face of a malefic threat.

Lev, twenty-four, hailing from the southern planets, was a female flora with pink skin. She flapped her giant butterfly wings on her back excitedly, seeing them.

""Good, you’re both here. General Carter, how was the trip? I know how space travel still doesn't agree with you humans.""

Carter drew a seat around the table for Daisy before taking one for himself, and Lev watched intently as she sat on it.

""You kidding? It was the best trip of my life,"" Carter said.

Lev cracked a smile as she saw them.""I see.""

Favian, twenty-four, hailing from the western planets, was a male aquis with blue skin and a muscular body. Favian Jumped out of his seat, seething, his blue diamond-shaped bug eyes glared at Carter.

""Enough with the pleasantries. The last time I checked, we were at war. Am I the only one who takes the future of his kind seriously?""

Carter and Lev gave Favian scowls, and the former prepared to open his mouth for a tirade. But Daisy stopped him with a single glare as the words readied to leave his lips. Orion readied to say something to quell the fight. However, he stopped as the remaining general, Róngyù, stepped into the Fray.

Róngyù, twenty-seven, hailing from the eastern planets, was a male Huǒ with red fur and a muscular body. He hurried to Favian, gently sitting his comrade back down. And even as Favian shared glares with Carter, Róngyù's friendly, smiling feline face sent a ceasefire he couldn't ignore.

""I apologize for losing my temper.” Favian took a deep breath. “Thanks for stopping me before I made a fool of myself, Róngyù.""

""Fear not, friend. We're all under the same pressure. I venture to say it would be odd if it didn’t get to one of us.""

""Indeed, now let us proceed with the meeting,"" Orion said.

Róngyù strolled back to his seat, and as Orion saw him seated, he pressed a button on the table. A giant holographic map of the galaxy appeared in front of them. Purple covered a massive portion of it.

""This is a map of the known parts of our galaxy. And the purple segments are everything the enemy controls,"" Orion said.

""Good god,"" Daisy said.

""The combination of Zola's technology and Mavor's dark powers have proven devastating over the centuries. And the shadow hand, of course.”

“Shadow hand?” Daisy asked.

“Mavor’s top five subordinates. Morana, Cymbeline, Zola, Nobunaga, and the youngest member, Evelyn,” Róngyù said.

“But with you, Damara, we finally have a lead. If only a narrow one. So we must decide what to do.""

Favian raised his hand, and as Orion saw him, he signaled for him to speak.

""Orion, we currently control several vital strategic positions. I propose we use Damara's power to fortify defenses and slowly move into the enemy territory.""

""Favian, you can't be serious,"" Lev said.

""And why not?""

""We've discussed this before. We'll never win this war playing defense. We should take Damara's powers and assault the strategic positions the enemy already possesses. We can retake the map far quicker that way.""

""Do you not understand the number of casualties that would come from a move like that?""

""Of course I do. But wars are won by making tough choices.""

""Enough."" Orion turned his gaze to Róngyù, looking at his comrades. ""Róngyù, you haven't voiced your opinion yet.""

""I honestly don't know what to say, Orion. But I think I favor Lev's plan better. As much as I loathe heavy casualties, ending this war as swiftly as possible must take precedence.""

""Let us vote. Those in favor of Favian, please raise your left hand. But those in favor of Lev, please raise your right hand.""

The generals swiftly raised their hands in the air. Lev and Róngyù raised their right hands. But Favian and Carter raised their left hands. And Favian looked at Carter, words caught in his throat as he saw him supporting his strategy.

Róngyù let out a deep sigh.""We have a tie. But if there is one thing we all agree on, we need Damara for our plans. So what does she say?”

All the eyes in the room went to Daisy, waiting for her answer. As she saw them, the gears of her consciousness went into overdrive. Again, being a farmer by birth and a seamstress by trade, she had only the barest knowledge of the delicate matter. Still, she could tell there was truth to both sides of the argument. But the image of Everton's dead body flashed in her mind, and her answer came with it as the frown Carter knew too well at this point returned to her face.

""All of you know far more about war than I ever can. But I think what would be worse than defeat is a Cadmean victory. So I support General Carter and General Favian.""

As Orion heard Daisy, he turned his gaze to Lev, waiting for her response. But she gave him a nod of acceptance.

""It seems we have reached an agreement. Now, let us move on to other important matters,"" Orion said.

Sarah and Lucas hopped off a hover bus and quickly continued towards Lucas's village, Yasai. The two traversed the grassy field, jogging to the village on the horizon. The field was a vast sea of the most emerald, sweet-smelling grass. Still, as they closed the distance, only a few meters away they stopped, Lucas first followed by Sarah.

“Lucas, what’s wrong?”

Lucas looked at his village, scanning it intensely. “It’s just been so long.”

Sarah grabbed his arm, pulling him forward. ”And it’ll be even longer the more you’re a baby about it.”

“Okay, okay. Let go of me.” Lucas pulled his arm away from Sarah. “And thanks.”

Lucas broke away from Sarah, returning to his jogging, and as he went Sarah fought a smile.

The two entered Yasai together. It was an idyllic and fruitful land, dreamlike similar to the fairytales of long ago. The scent of fruits and vegetables wrapped around Lucas like a hug from an old friend he hadn’t seen in years. The Hachiko’s houses were comprised of either wood or stone bricks. They had farms of varying sizes on every corner but weren’t industrialized. Yasai was a small utopia, resistant to the ravages of modernity, captivating in its rustic splendor.

The Hachiko dashed left and right until they spotted Lucas. As he and Sarah walked through the village, the many inhabitants sprinted to their old friend. Giving him a hero's welcome as joyous cheers filled the air, celebrating his contributions to the war against the Nemesis empire. Never before had someone from their region, let alone village, made it so far in wider galactic society.

Sarah grew a smile. ""Enjoying this, hometown hero?""

""Well, I certainly don't mind.""

The cheering swiftly stopped as a beautiful Hachiko woman approached Lucas.

""Welcome home, Lucas Fortis. Everyone in the region was abuzz when word came out that you were returning.” The woman gave Lucas a sealed envelope. “Not every day our kind produces a war hero.""

""Thanks. But I'm just a good pilot.""

""And modest. It's such an honor to give you that gift certificate. Business in the pleasure district will boom with you as a patron. Plus, our women are bound to be overjoyed meeting you.

Sarah and Lucas shared a look, their eyes widening as they heard the woman.

""P-pleasure district? You mean the place where they-""

Sarah grabbed Lucas by his shirt collar, forcing him to look her in the eye as she glared. 

""If you dare accept this lady's offer, I will rip off your ability to enjoy yourself.” Sarah cracked her knuckles. “If you catch my drift.""

""Sarah, let go of me. I'm not that type of man. And frankly, I don't know what to say since you think I am.""

A look of shame swept Sarah's face, and she quickly released Lucas. As he was free, Lucas returned the envelope to the woman.

""Thanks, but no thanks.""

Lucas swiftly walked away from the crowd, but Sarah followed close behind.

""Lucas, I'm so sorry. I honestly don't know why I'm always so angry.” Sarah took a deep breath. “It's like someone else controls my body.""

""Apology accepted.""

Sarah grew a large smile as she heard Lucas. But the two quickly reached his old house and saw his mother, Lucy. And Lucas’s spine stiffened like a board as he saw her. It had been two years since they last met, and the war kept him from calling her often. Lucy tilled the land of their home alone until she saw her son. She dropped her hoe and hurried over to Lucas. As she reached him, Lucy hugged her son with an iron grip, and he swiftly reciprocated. They only had each other with no other living family, and now, after what felt like an eternity, they were reunited.

Sarah broke down crying, loudly sobbing, seeing the display of love from a mother and her child.

Lucy looked at Sarah, drawn over by the sound of her crying. ""Hello there. Sorry, I didn't notice you.""

""Mother, this is a friend from the army, Sarah Fortitudo.""

""Glory to the lawgiver. Lucas, your friend, is quite pretty. Good boy."" Lucy playfully winked her eye at Lucas.

The Nemesis fortress was as busy as a beehive as the personnel hurried to their stations. The divinus's chamber lay shut as the scientists hurriedly exited it around its thick metal doors. Soldiers left the room in droves to join the battle outside, but the lead scientist jumped out of his skin as he saw them.

*""You can't leave us in the middle of an invasion.""* The scientist shouted.

""Be calm, Doctor. The invaders are as good as dead. However, my men and I must handle some weak spots.""

The lead soldier marched off with his men. But as they prepared to leave, the door opened, revealing Daisy, Everton, and Sarah. And Everton was shoving an unconscious Nemesis soldier’s face on the DNA security scanner. Before the soldier could do anything, Everton punched him in the face. As Everton sprinted into the chamber, another soldier drew his Tyloblade, attempting to stab him. However, Everton caught his arm, crushing it. And as the soldier screamed, Everton used him as a living flail, knocking more Nemesis soldiers away. 

As Everton threw the soldier at his comrades, another aimed his plasma gun at him. However, Daisy got in the way with her shield as he fired. The blast bounced off it and struck the soldier’s arm. And Daisy rammed into him with her weapon, knocking him down. Daisy quickly spotted another Nemesis soldier booking towards a big red button, the security alarm, and flung her shield at him. As he was about to press the button, it hit the back of his head, subduing him.

Finally, the remaining Nemesis soldiers in the chamber charged at them. But Sarah grew to her giant size and smashed them into the floor with one punch, dead.

""Good work, girls. Now, we must make haste. We stopped them from calling reinforcements, but they'll learn something is amiss soon.” Everton ran to the metal doors, typing away on the security holophone panel. “Daisy, watch my back. And Gigantes girl, look after the scientists.""

""You got it, and my name is Sarah.""

""Irrelevant.""

Sarah looked at Everton, grinning her teeth, but still carried out his orders. As he worked with the holophone panel, Daisy stood guard over him.

On the battlefield, Gancelot lay on the ground surrounded by his soldiers, clutching his chest in pain as one helped him stand. 

His communicator rang, and he answered it.

""Everton…incredible, but you need five minutes?""

\*\*\*

Four minutes later, the Nemesis scientists cowered in a corner. Daisy, Everton, and Sarah prepared for trouble as they worriedly stared at the barricaded door to the room with their weapons ready, awaiting Nemesis soldiers to burst through.

""God, we're sitting ducks. Everton, can't we pry open the doors to the divinus and have Sarah haul it out of here?""

""I wish. It's bound to its shrine. The two go together or not at all.” Everton took his gaze off the door, looking at Daisy. “All we have to do is stay alive until the security procedure shuts down, and then we can activate the emergency evacuation.""

""Emergency-""

""The entire chamber is prepared for airlift for emergencies like this. When it's time, Fortis and the other pilots will get it and us out of here."" Sarah interrupted.

The doors to the room got blasted open in a flash of light. A sea of Nemesis soldiers flooded in. Among them were ones wearing sinister-looking black armor with numerous jagged edges, cyber troopers. They were cyborg soldiers, Nemesis warriors that had their physical attributes artificially enhanced through technology.

One shot a massive blast at Daisy and the others. They barely dodged it, and Sarah retaliated by swatting him with her giant hand. But he shocked her away with an intense energy field, revealing no damage from her attack. As she got knocked back to regular size.

""E-Everton, what are those metal monsters?"" Daisy asked, trembling.

""Dr. Zola's work.""

A loud alarm went off, and Everton jumped to his feet. *""The security system is down. To the divinus, hurry.""*

Daisy, Everton, and Sarah booked for the divinus. The Nemesis soldiers unloaded a salvo at them. As they ran away, one of the shots hit Sarah in the leg, knocking her down. The soldiers aimed their weapons, preparing to kill her, but Daisy saw this and hurried back. 

Daisy shoved Sarah out of harm's way and readied to die in her place. However, Everton grabbed her, tossing her out of the way. She was helpless to do anything but watch as Everton was shot multiple times to his body before dropping to the ground a limp husk.

*""No,""* Daisy shouted.

The salvo continued unrelenting in the vast number of shots, but with her mind fixated on Everton, Daisy ran over to him with suicidal abandon. However, as Sarah saw Daisy ignoring the plasma bolts flying by her head, she grew to a giant size and ripped out a portion of the floor to block them.

""Oh, gracious Heavenly Father, I beg you, don't take Everton away.""

""D-daisy, you must finish the mission.” Everton pointed his trembling hand to the door. “The emergency evacuation can only work by pressing a large green button on the top of a panel in the chamber.”

""But I can't just-""

Quickly, Daisy saw the Nemesis soldiers break through Sarah’s defense.

""Do as he says, Daisy.” Sarah labored to grasp the soldiers approaching her. “I'll hold them back as long as possible. Just run and don't look back.""

Daisy's face folded intensely as tears flowed from her eyes, but she reluctantly booked for the divinus. She quickly reached the doors, entering its chamber, but one of the armored soldiers flew past Sarah after her. However, brilliant heavenly light burst from it, knocking him away with a powerful shockwave. 

The trooper quickly stood back up. Still, the trooper’s hand was shocked away by an energy field. And even as he shot at it with his guns, they lay without a scratch. Was the Divinus behind this strange development? Could it be that it was never totally a prisoner? Was it waiting for the right time to play its trump card? Still, why now of all times?

\*\*\*

Inside the chamber, Daisy looked at the divinus in amazement. However, she quickly spotted the panel with the green button and ran over, hastily pressing it. 

A minute passed, but nothing happened in the chamber. As Daisy noticed, she frantically pressed the button repeatedly, but nothing happened.

As she looked at the panel, her features hardened. Her heart pounded like a drum, her breathing got heavier, and she punched it in a mad tantrum. But as her knuckles became bloody and bruised, she dropped to the floor crying and curled up in a ball.

""Rise, human child. We have important matters to discuss.""

Daisy jumped to her feet and looked around the room for the source of the voice she heard. However, as she found nobody else in the room, she turned her gaze to the divinus, remembering her conversation with Gancelot.

""D-Divinus, are you talking to me? What do you mean by important matters?""

""I know why you are here. Tell me, human child, why should I give you my power?""

""W-well, because we're here on a quest for justice. We need your power to conquer a monstrous evil.""

""You are not the first to say those words, you know. Countless people before you have demanded my power for weapons and battle strategies to commit murder and called it justice.”

“You have to believe me.”

“Why?”

Daisy got down, bowing to the divinus, touching her forehead on the floor.

""I understand how you feel about violence since I do, too. But I beg you to help the billions suffering under oppression. I will surrender my very life to convince you.""

A deafening silence washed over the chamber for a minute as Daisy made her ply, but the divinus finally answered.

""I have examined your words and heart, human child. And you have spoken no lies. You may have my power with two conditions.""

Daisy jumped to her feet.""Thank you. But what are these conditions?""

""The first is only you will have access to my power. You will become my vessel, an agent of peace and justice. And take on a new name for your rebirth as my proxy. As for the second, you must promise to use my power only for noble ends. Do you agree to these terms?”

Daisy nodded in agreement, and the divinus shot into her body, breaking it apart as she became an amorphous blob of pure light. However, she regained a human form free from all the cuts and bruises her previous self sustained. And armor forged of light surrounded it, a metal dress of blue. As she awakened from her rebirth, Daisy thoroughly scanned her new self at her garments and shield, appearing newly made. 

""I christen you, Damara, Damara the valiant. Now go forth and use my gifts wisely,” Divinus said in a dying whisper.

Daisy looked to the door where Everton and Sarah were tightening her grip on her new shield.

\*\*\*

Outside, Sarah dropped to the ground, bloody and barely clinging to life. Everton was in the same spot, slowly dying. And Nemesis soldiers pointed their guns at them, waiting for the order to kill.

As the armored soldiers tried to enter the divinus's chamber, they were shocked away by an invisible force field.

""Doctor, what is the meaning of this?""

""I-It must be the divinus.""

""Yes, but how? I thought you took measures to ensure this doesn't happen.""

""We did. It seems even after all our research. We don't know the full extent of its power.” The scientist looked towards the soldier in fear. “But don't worry. With the emergency evacuation disabled, there's no escape.""

A Nemesis soldier came to them, pointing to Everton and Sarah. ""Sir, can we please put these animals down now?""

""I will allow them to speak their final words first.""

""We have nothing to say to you people. Get it over with,"" Sarah spat.

The lead soldier gave the signal to kill Everton and Sarah. The Nemesis soldiers prepared to shoot them dead, and Sarah took a deep breath, readying to meet her doom. However, as they were about to pull their triggers, the doors to the divinus burst open with Daisy's giant shield, smashing through them. The soldiers by the doors flew to the other side of the room, crashing down limp. As the remaining soldiers saw Daisy walk out, they turned their guns away from Everton and Sarah, unloading a salvo at her instead. Daisy's shield came in its path, telekinetically directed by her index finger, blocking each strike.

The shots bounced off Daisy's shield, filling the room with dust. However, Daisy shrunk it back to size, guiding it toward its targets. It swiftly hit almost all the Nemesis soldiers, subduing them, and missing the leader. As he saw his comrades defeated, he charged at Daisy, setting up a punch. Still, she effortlessly caught it and punched him in the gut, ending the threat.

Daisy gently placed her adversary on the floor, appearing before the lead scientist in the blink of an eye. ""For the safety of you and your colleagues. Please get back in your corner.""

The scientists in the room followed behind their leader back into the corner. As Daisy saw them, she hurried over to Everton and Sarah.

""Everton, Sarah, thank heaven you're alive.""

""Who are you? How do you know our names?"" Sarah asked.

""You don't recognize me?” 

At that moment, Daisy realized she had a true rebirth. Her face was no longer the same in her current form.

”Listen, I don't have time to explain. But it's me, Daisy.""

""Truthfully?""

Daisy nodded to Sarah's question. 

She tried to pick up Everton, but as she moved him, he screamed in pain.

""I'm such a fool. Everton, I'm so sorry. I should know better than to move you in this state.""

""D-daisy, my time is here. Come close so I may speak my final words.""

""You're delirious from the pain. Sarah, please watch him while I find help.""

Daisy tried to leave them, but Everton grabbed her arm. He refused to let her go, and she stopped trying. She knew Everton wasn’t delirious. Even if she could find a doctor, he likely wouldn’t have time to treat such dire wounds. So, she looked at Everton, crying and a piece of her died inside as she accepted cruel reality.

""Firstly, please tell Orion he was a good friend. It was an honor having him as a commander.”

“Yes, sir,” Daisy said nodding, her voice cracking.

“The next thing is you are like my second daughter, Daisy. I was trying to tell you that on the ship.” 

“Yes, sir. Thank you.” Daisy wiped the tears flowing down her cheeks, now sobbing.

Everton coughed violently and Daisy and Sarah went to help him, but he soon steadied himself.

”Finally, please promise me you will redeem my greatest failure.”

“What?”

“I’ve always regretted Evelyn never getting the chance to grow up. My child, you will pursue your dreams and live a long and happy life, won't you?"" 

Everton initiated a pinky promise, and Daisy accepted it.

*""I was so wrong. You are my Pa.""*

As they finished the pinky promise, Everton's eyes closed, and his breathing stopped. Sarah checked his heartbeat, and her grim face at Daisy confirmed he was dead.

Daisy's screams of agony filled the room as she dropped on his corpse in a crying fit, snot dripping from her nose. But she quickly went silent. Her misery gave way to fiery rage that rivaled the heat of Prometheus, marching out of the room. The young woman experienced an emotion that she thought she would never know. It was an emotion she swore she would never indulge in. Now she couldn’t help but feel it and allow it to guide her. At last, she knew true hate.

Outside, the United Planets soldiers and the Nemesis continued their war. However, all their attention went to the fortress as a massive explosion happened. Daisy stood on top of it, emitting a brilliant light, and it quickly swallowed the battlefield, signaling a victory for the United Planets.

I’ve recently started doing 2-day fasts in sync with my menstrual cycle and I’ve been amazed at how easy it is when I start the fast on the right day, and how great I feel afterward. 

I would still have steamed milk in my coffee every morning, probably the occasional Diet Coke, La Croix, water with electrolyte replacement, and maybe bone/meat/veggie broths.

Fast forward 10 months that chair now has milk stains, spit-up spots, and a random mystery mark I don’t even want to guess at. I’ve wiped it down, scrubbed it, thrown a blanket over it, but white fabric is not forgiving. And of course, baby now thinks it’s hilarious to rub her snack-covered hands all over the armrests.

I *still* love how it looks, and I don’t regret getting it (yet), but if you’re on the fence maybe go for a darker color or something wipeable. White is beautiful, but it’s not baby-proof.

1lacucv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy_Fitness/comments/1lacucv/skinny_fat_fix/,Skinny Fat Fix,"As you know- To change the ""Skinny-fat"" physique we need to...  
​- Workout Right  
​- Eat Right  
​  
​We cannot ""workout"" and expect anything to change. We need to **make it** change.  
​We need to *train* for the change we want. Read here for ""[Working Out VS Training](https://www.ryansandmann.com/blog/working-out-vs-training)"".  
​  
​**How To Train:**  
​We are trying to change our *physique.*  
*​*That means we need to workout to *change* our physique.  
​  
​That doesn't mean you *can't* train for other things like strength or conditioning- Those are great things to train for!!  
​But they shouldn't be the focus of your workouts and we won't go over them in this blog.  
​  
When it comes to training to build muscle...  
  
​**First:** You do not need to workout more than 4 days per week.  
​2-4 is plenty. (I've been lifting for 15 years I train 3-4 days per week and get very good results.)  
If you can get 45-75 minute workouts 2-4 is enough.  
If you can only manage 15-30 minutes- then you might need 5-7 days.​  
  
​**Second:** You do not need to do ""body part splits"". Aka ""Chest Day"".  
​2-4 full body workouts per week will...  
​- Keep you moving and feeling good.  
​- Decrease overall muscle soreness.  
​- Get you in and out of the gym faster.  
​  
​**Third:** When you are working out- You need to make your muscles cry.  
​If you are not fatigued after a set, you probably didn't go hard enough. **Note:** There is a sweet spot of going hard but not overdoing it. Please be wise.  
​  
​  
​Here is an example...

https://preview.redd.it/7hsu6e1eco6f1.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b4980840430112e718b48b0087f9e306061546f

With this 3 day program we can hit every muscle group we care to grow at least 2 times per week.  
​  
​**Note:** Some of the smaller muscles get hit from the bigger exercises- Ex. Biceps get hit from Chin-ups.  
​So not every muscle needs to get *directly* targeted throughout the week.  
​\_\_\_



**How To Eat:**  
​Eating right will be focused on...  
​- Protein  
​- Carbs  
​- Total Calories  
​  
​​**Note:** Micronutrients and fiber are both super important in general. Try not to neglect those- Aka eat fruit and veggies.  
​  
The goal is to...  
\- Get 80-100% of your bodyweight in grams of protein per day.  
  
\- Eat your maintenance level of calories. (I can't tell you what that is because it's different for everyone) → Go to [caloriecalculator.net](http://caloriecalculator.net) or download MyFitnessPal and answer the questions to get an idea on how many calories you should eat.  
  
\- Get a good amount of you calories from carbs- especially pre and post workout.  
  
  
​Here's an example of a day of eating...

https://preview.redd.it/1za287eico6f1.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=281d43999d7e86d079d3c5e86ef4ce0e2eb8752f

All of these meals can be made to *easily* have 30+ grams of protein.  
​Add a snack in there for an extra 10-20 grams and that would be a **very** solid day of eating!  
  
I also thought of meals that would be teenager acceptable- I think young me would eat all of these meals happily.  
Adult me would have many more options!  
​  
​**Note:** Some of the meals seem like they wouldn't be high in protein- Like ""Grilled Cheese w/ Turkey"".  
​The right types of bread and cheese will turn a simple sandwich into a protein powerhouse!  
​  
  
​Now let's get into the action steps!  
​

# Physique Level-up Quests

So the quest here is to make one, or both, of the following changes!  
​  
​**Workout Change:** Train to build muscle.  
  
\- If you don't already- Workout 2-4 times per week.  
And  
\- Make sure you make your muscles cry.  
​  
​At least the ones you are trying to build- they should cry 3-5 times in a workout, twice per week.  
  
**EX:**  
**​**Trying to build the chest.  
Workout 1 = DB Chest Press 4 x 6-12  
Workout 2 = DB Incline Chest Press 3 x10-12  
  
Both of those exercises should make your pecs weep.  
Along with other exercises that will hit the chest, just not so hard, you will be pec popping in no time! (Provided your nutrition is on point)  
​  
  
​**Nutrition Change:** Increase protein.  
​Most people don't eat enough protein. Even people who think they eat enough don't. (I know from personal experience)  
  
And from nutrition coaching around 100 people- This is the hardest thing for almost everyone.  
  
So...​  
​Pick one meal, that you already eat regularly and enjoy.  
​Figure out how to add more protein to it.  
​  
**​EX:**  
​- Cereal: Add chocolate or vanilla protein powder to the milk!  
​- Eggs: Add chicken sausage and or extra egg whites.  
​- Pasta: Swap the pasta for a higher protein option like chickpea or my favorite- Brami pasta!  
​- Coffee: Drink half of your normal coffee and use the rest for a protein shake. (Blend banana, protein powder, and oikos yogurt with your coffee)  
  
Do this, one meal at a time, until you have learned how to add the protein while still enjoying the food!  
  
You will have to weigh / measure ingredients and either use an app like MyFitnessPal or do some good math using the nutrition facts of whatever you're eating.  
  
Either way- Start small with one meal at a time and go from there!

I meticulously tracked his escalating betrayals in my secret ""Breaking Point Ledger,"" knowing 100 points meant freedom.  
The ledger filled quickly, fueled by his unapologetic neglect and public displays of obsession.  
Then, disaster struck: caught in a violent car crash, I lay bleeding, my world shattering around me.  
Doctors, grim-faced, revealed I was eight weeks pr\*\*nant, desperately needing help.  
But when the hospital reached Ethan, his urgent command echoed chillingly: prioritize Chloe, who had a mere allergic reaction.  
My baby, our baby, was lost.  
""We couldn't save the baby,"" the nurse later confirmed, her voice laced with a silent fury that mirrored my own.  
The ledger, once a quiet tally, now screamed past its limit, leaving a brutal, undeniable score of his final, ultimate betrayal.  
There was no going back; only forward.  
With a soul-deep resolve, I signed my divorce papers, reclaiming Ava Miller and leaving behind the shattered remnants of a life that was never truly mine.  
My bags were already packed for Austin, ready for a new chapter where I would rebuild, reclaim, and rise from the ashes.  
  
  
Chapter 1  
Three years.  
  
Three years I'd been Ava Miller, no, Ava Cole.  
  
Married to Ethan Cole.  
  
It felt like a role I was playing, and I was forgetting my lines.  
  
I sat at my laptop. A new document glowed on the screen.  
  
I typed: ""Breaking Point Ledger.""  
  
Simple rules. Ethan starts at zero.  
  
Every time he chose Chloe Vance, his college sweetheart, over me, his wife, he got demerit points.  
  
One hundred points. That was the magic number.  
  
One hundred points, and I'd call a lawyer.  
  
No more fights. No more pleading. Just a clean, cold number.  
  
My fingers found the keys.  
  
""Flew to LA to console Chloe on my birthday after her 'devastating' audition rejection. -5 points.""  
  
The memory was still sharp. My ruined dinner reservations. His quick, unapologetic exit.  
  
""Left me stranded on the LIE after a fender bender because Chloe had a 'meltdown' at JFK. -10 points.""  
  
I remembered sitting in the cold car, the tow truck driver looking at me with pity.  
  
""Lost his wedding ring helping Chloe 'redecorate' her SoHo loft. -10 points.""  
  
He'd shrugged it off. ""It's just a thing, Ava.""  
  
My ring felt heavy on my finger.  
  
Total: -25 points.  
  
A quarter of the way there. Or maybe, a quarter of the way to freedom.  
  
I was sketching designs for a small community center, a project I'd been dreaming about, in the home office.  
  
Our home office.  
  
His home office, really.  
  
It was filled with Ethan's things. His law books, his awards.  
  
And Chloe's things.  
  
A framed photo of Ethan and Chloe, laughing, from their college days, sat on his desk.  
  
A bright, abstract painting Chloe had made for him hung on the wall. He said it ""inspired"" him.  
  
Ethan walked in. He needed his work laptop for a conference call.  
  
He glanced at my screen. ""Breaking Point Ledger.""  
  
His eyebrow went up. He leaned over, clicked it open.  
  
He skimmed the few lines.  
  
A small, dismissive smile played on his l\*ps.  
  
""Ava, this is… melodrama, even for you.""  
  
He closed the file.  
  
""And my work devices are for work. Client privilege, sensitive data. Your… things… shouldn't be on here.""  
  
My heart squeezed. My ledger, my pain, reduced to ""things.""  
  
Less important than his files, less important than Chloe's smiling face on his desk.  
  
That night, we were at a client dinner. Crucial for Ethan's partnership track at the firm.  
  
He was charming, attentive to Mr. Henderson, the CEO.  
  
I played the supportive wife, smiling until my face ached.  
  
Then Ethan's phone buzzed. He glanced at it.  
  
His face changed. The charm vanished. Replaced by raw panic.  
  
It was Mark, one of his college buddies.  
  
Ethan stood up so fast his chair nearly tipped over.  
  
""Excuse me, Mr. Henderson. A family emergency. I have to go.""  
  
He didn't look at me. He was already moving.  
  
He grabbed his coat.  
  
""Ava, I have to go. It's Chloe. Her loft… there's a fire.""  
  
Then he was gone, leaving me with the stunned clients and the bill.  
  
Mr. Henderson looked confused. ""Everything alright, Mrs. Cole?""  
  
""Yes, just a… a small crisis with a… a dear friend,"" I managed.  
  
The lie tasted bitter.  
  
I made more excuses. Apologized. Said Ethan would call.  
  
I couldn't stay there. The pity in their eyes was too much.  
  
I got a cab.  
  
""SoHo, please,"" I told the driver. Chloe's address.  
  
Why was I going? Morbid curiosity. A need to see.  
  
To see what was more important than his career, than me.  
  
Red and blue lights flashed ahead. Sm\*ke curled into the night sky.  
  
Fire trucks. An ambulance.  
  
My stomach twisted.  
  
I saw him. Ethan.  
  
He was arguing with a firefighter at the police line.  
  
""She's in there! Chloe Vance! Apartment 4B!"" His voice was hoarse.  
  
""Sir, we can't let you in. It's not safe. My men are checking,"" the firefighter said, firm but calm.  
  
Ethan wasn't listening. He looked wild.  
  
He ducked under the tape.  
  
The firefighter yelled.  
  
I heard Ethan shout, clear and desperate, as he ran towards the smoky entrance.  
  
""My career can go to hell, as long as Chloe is safe!""  
  
The words hit me. Harder than any physical blow.  
  
Mark and David, Ethan's friends, rushed up to the scene.  
  
They saw me standing there, by the cab, watching.  
  
They looked guilty. Awkward.  
  
""Ava,"" Mark started, ""Ethan, he just… he gets like this about Chloe. Always has.""  
  
David nodded, too quickly. ""Yeah, ever since college. She's… well, she's Chloe.""  
  
They were trying to smooth it over. They were making it worse.  
  
Confirming everything I already knew.  
  
His intense, unwavering obsession.  
  
Then, movement at the building's entrance.  
  
Firefighters emerged, supporting a coughing Chloe.  
  
Her face was smudged with soot, her trendy clothes singed, but she was walking.  
  
She looked dramatic, leaning heavily on a firefighter.  
  
A moment later, Ethan stumbled out.  
  
He was covered in soot, his hair singed, coughing violently.  
  
He rushed to Chloe's side, ignoring the paramedics trying to check him.  
  
""Chloe! Are you okay? Are you hurt?"" He held her arms, his voice full of anguish.  
  
She clung to him, burying her face in his ch\*st. ""Oh, Ethan! You saved me!""  
  
He swayed, clearly exhausted, but held her tight.  
  
He looked like he was about to collapse.  
  
I watched them. The hero and his damsel.  
  
My mind flashed back. Professor Miller, my father. NYU Law.  
  
Ethan Cole, his prize student. Brilliant. Ambitious.  
  
I'd met him at a moot court competition. He was dazzling. I was smitten.  
  
Then Dad got sick. Terminal cancer.  
  
His dying wish, whispered to Ethan at his bedside.  
  
""Look after Ava. Please, Ethan. Look after my girl.""  
  
Ethan proposed a week after the funeral.  
  
""It's not just obligation, Ava,"" he'd said, holding my hands. ""I care about you. Deeply.""  
  
I'd wanted to believe him. I needed to believe him.  
  
The poker night. Six months after our wedding.  
  
Ethan's friends, drunk, loud. I was in the kitchen, getting dr\*\*ks.  
  
I overheard David. ""Poor Ava. She has no idea.""  
  
Mark slurred, ""No idea about what?""  
  
""That Ethan only married her because Chloe ran off and married that European tech billionaire. He was a wreck. Couldn't get out of b\*d for weeks.""  
  
Chloe. Always Chloe.  
  
She was divorced now, back in New York. Back in Ethan's orbit.  
  
His coldness, his distance, his constant attention to Chloe's needs. It all made a horrible kind of sense.  
  
I wasn't his choice. I was his consolation prize.  
  
That overheard conversation was the real start of the ledger.  
  
The little notebook I'd bought the next day.  
  
The digital file was just its latest form.  
  
It wasn't just about his current neglect.  
  
It was about the lie our whole marriage was built on.  
  
The ledger was my silent scream. My countdown.  
  
My way of taking back some control.  
  
Chloe's return to New York had accelerated everything.  
  
More calls. More ""emergencies."" More drama.  
  
More points in the ledger.  
  
The -25 felt like it had accumulated in a flash.  
  
Each new entry was a step closer to the door.  
  
Paramedics were insisting Ethan go to the hospital. Sm\*ke inhalation.  
  
He kept waving them off, fussing over Chloe.  
  
""I'm fine. Just make sure Chloe is okay.""  
  
Chloe was milking it, a few coughs, a hand to her forehead.  
  
""Oh, Ethan, you were so brave. I was so scared.""  
  
He looked at her with such tenderness.  
  
A look he never gave me.  
  
Mark and David hovered near me.  
  
""He'll be alright, Ava,"" Mark said, trying for reassuring. ""The Coles have connections. Best doctors in the city.""  
  
David added, ""Yeah, money's no object for them.""  
  
As if that fixed a heart shattered by neglect.  
  
As if that erased the image of him running into a burning building for another woman.  
  
I didn't go to the hospital with them.  
  
Chloe needed Ethan. Ethan needed Chloe.  
  
There was no space for Ava.  
  
I went home to our cold, empty apartment.  
  
I opened my laptop. The ""Breaking Point Ledger"" glowed.  
  
My fingers typed.  
  
""Abandoned crucial client dinner for Chloe's fire. -5 points.""  
  
""Rushed into burning building for Chloe, risked his life declaring his career meant nothing next to her safety. -15 points.""  
  
New total: -45 points.  
  
Almost halfway there.  
  
A cold dread, mixed with a strange sense of anticipation, settled in my stomach.  
  
It was happening. The end was coming.  
  
  
Chapter 2  
The next morning, I called Laura Jenkins, a divorce lawyer Sarah Chen, my college friend, had recommended.  
  
""Just an initial consultation,"" I told Laura's assistant.  
  
But I knew. This wasn't just ""initial.""  
  
Ethan had stayed at Chloe's new temporary place - a luxury hotel suite his family probably paid for.  
  
He sent a text. ""Chloe very shaken. Staying with her. Don't wait up.""  
  
No ""Are you okay?"" No ""Sorry about the dinner.""  
  
I spent the day at the hospital. Not for Ethan.  
  
He was fine, discharged after a few hours of observation.  
  
Chloe, however, had insisted on a full check-up for ""trauma.""  
  
I saw them from a distance in the hospital cafeteria.  
  
Chloe was attempting to feed Ethan a spoonful of yogurt.  
  
She was clumsy, giggling when some of it dripped on his chin.  
  
He smiled. Indulgent.  
  
The way a parent smiles at a child's messy attempt to help.  
  
It made me sick.  
  
I was supposed to be his wife. The one to care for him.  
  
But Chloe always got to play that role.  
  
Chloe dabbed at his chin with a napkin.  
  
""Oh, Ethan, I feel so terrible. You got hurt because of me."" Her eyes welled up.  
  
Classic Chloe.  
  
""Don't be silly,"" Ethan said, his voice soft. He took her hand. ""It was a little sm\*ke. I'm fine. The important thing is you're safe.""  
  
He dismissed his own discomfort, his own risk, to soothe her.  
  
Like he always did.  
  
Chloe's tears started to fall. Big, fat, crocodile tears.  
  
""But your career… you said…""  
  
Ethan pulled her closer. ""Shhh. Don't worry about that.""  
  
He looked around, then leaned in, his voice low, conspiratorial, but I was close enough to hear.  
  
""You know, I never really wanted to be a corporate lawyer. All those mergers and acquisitions… so boring.""  
  
Chloe sniffled, looking up at him through her lashes. ""Really?""  
  
""Really,"" he confirmed. ""Remember when we were kids? You said you wanted to own a string of charming little bistros, all over the world.""  
  
Chloe's face lit up. ""And you said you'd be my business manager, making sure they all ran perfectly!""  
  
Ethan smiled, a genuine, almost boyish smile I hadn't seen in years.  
  
""Maybe it's not too late for that,"" he said softly. ""Maybe this fire… maybe it's a sign.""  
  
A sign? A sign to throw away his lucrative career, the one his family had pushed him into, the one he'd worked tirelessly for?  
  
For her childhood dream?  
  
My bl\*\*d ran cold.  
  
Chloe threw her arms around his neck.  
  
""Oh, Ethan! You always know how to make me feel better!""  
  
He hugged her back, str\*king her hair.  
  
A long, tender embrace.  
  
Right there in the public cafeteria.  
  
No thought for who might see. No thought for me, his wife, who he knew might also be in the same hospital.  
  
I stood frozen for a moment, the scene burning into my brain.  
  
Then I turned and walked away.  
  
I couldn't watch anymore. It was too much.  
  
The casual intimacy. The shared dreams.  
  
The life he clearly wanted, with her.  
  
As I was leaving the hospital, I bumped into one of Ethan's senior partners, Mr. Davies.  
  
He looked surprised to see me.  
  
""Ava! I heard about the fire. Is Ethan alright?""  
  
""He's fine, Mr. Davies. Just some sm\*ke.""  
  
""Good, good. He gave us all a scare, abandoning the Henderson dinner like that. But knowing Ethan, if it involved Chloe Vance…"" He trailed off, a knowing look in his eye.  
  
He then handed me a thick envelope.  
  
""This came by courier this morning. It's for Ethan. His resignation letter.""  
  
My breath hitched. ""Resignation?""  
  
""Yes. Effective immediately. Cites 'personal reasons' and a desire to 'pursue other ventures.' Frankly, Ava, we're all shocked. He was on the fast track to partner.""  
  
Mr. Davies looked genuinely bewildered.  
  
""If you see him, tell him he's always welcome back, if he changes his mind. Though, after this…"" He shook his head.  
  
I took the envelope. It felt heavy in my hands.  
  
I waited until I was in a cab, heading home, before I opened it.  
  
Ethan's familiar, decisive handwriting on the firm's letterhead.  
  
""…after careful consideration, I have decided to resign from my position… to pursue long-held personal aspirations that are no longer compatible with the demands of corporate law…""  
  
The usual corporate speak.  
  
But then, a handwritten addition at the bottom, almost an afterthought, yet it screamed louder than all the typed words.  
  
""Chloe's back. The eagle needs to fly with its flock, not be tethered to the ground. It's time to help her build her nests.""  
  
Eagle? Nests?  
  
His st\*pid pet names for her and her dreams.  
  
It was all there. Black and white.  
  
His entire career, a placeholder. His ambition, a charade.  
  
All of it, secondary to Chloe Vance.  
  
I leaned my head against the cool window of the cab.  
  
His entire life. Dictated by her.  
  
His choices. His sacrifices.  
  
And me? Where did I fit in?  
  
I was the tether. The thing holding him to the ground.  
  
The convenient wife he married when his ""eagle"" had temporarily flown off with someone else.  
  
I felt a wave of despair, so profound it left me breathless.  
  
But then, something else. A flicker.  
  
Anger. Cold, hard anger.  
  
And resolve.  
  
He wanted to fly with Chloe? Fine.  
  
I would cut the tether myself.  
  
I got home and went straight to my laptop.  
  
Not the ledger this time.  
  
I opened a new browser window.  
  
""Top architecture firms, Austin, Texas.""  
  
Sarah Chen, my best friend from architecture school, had moved to Austin a year ago.  
  
She was a brilliant graphic designer. We'd always talked about starting our own studio.  
  
""Miller & Chen Designs."" It had a nice ring to it.  
  
I found Sarah's number.  
  
My hand was steady as I dialed.  
  
""Ava! Hey! What's up?"" Sarah's cheerful voice was a balm.  
  
""Sarah,"" I said, my own voice surprisingly firm. ""Remember our plan? The design studio?""  
  
""Yeah, of course! 'New Leaf Designs,' we called it back then, right? For new beginnings.""  
  
A small smile touched my l\*ps. ""New Leaf Designs. I like that.""  
  
""Are you serious, Ava? You want to do it?""  
  
""I'm serious,"" I said. ""I need a new leaf. A whole new tree. A different forest, even.""  
  
Sarah whooped on the other end. ""Yes! This is amazing! Austin is booming. We can do this, Ava! I know we can!""  
  
Her enthusiasm was infectious.  
  
For the first time in a long time, I felt a tiny spark of hope.  
  
A new leaf. Yes. That's exactly what I needed.  
  
  
Chapter 3  
""So, I'm filing for divorce,"" I told Sarah, cutting straight to the chase after we gushed about 'New Leaf Designs' for a few minutes.  
  
""And I'm moving to Austin.""  
  
There was a stunned silence on the other end of the line.  
  
""Whoa, Ava. Divorce? Moving? That's… big.""  
  
""It's necessary, Sarah. Long overdue."" I didn't elaborate. She didn't press.  
  
That's why she was my best friend.  
  
""Okay,"" she said, her voice regaining its usual pep. ""Okay, partner. Let's do this. Austin will welcome you with open arms. And so will I.""  
  
The next few days, I threw myself into planning.  
  
Sketches for potential projects. Business plans. Researching Austin's architectural scene.  
  
It felt good. To use my brain again. To feel passion for something other than dissecting Ethan's latest betrayal.  
  
My mind, usually a tangled mess of hurt and resentment, felt clearer. Focused.  
  
I was an architect. I was good at it. I'd just forgotten.  
  
Ethan was still staying with Chloe, ""helping her sort things out"" after the fire.  
  
He'd call occasionally. Brief, distracted updates about Chloe's insurance, Chloe's search for a new loft, Chloe's emotional state.  
  
Never about us. Never about me.  
  
It was easier that way. It solidified my resolve.  
  
He came back to our apartment on our wedding anniversary.  
  
I was in the spare room, which I'd started converting into a temporary workspace, surrounded by blueprints and sketches.  
  
He stood in the doorway, looking surprised.  
  
""Working late?"" he asked. He still had soot smudges on his expensive suit jacket from days ago. Or maybe new ones.  
  
""Just some personal projects,"" I said, not looking up.  
  
My architectural portfolio needed a serious update.  
  
""Oh. Good for you,"" he said. ""Keeping busy.""  
  
There was an awkward silence.  
  
I continued sketching, my lines firm and precise.  
  
I felt his eyes on me.  
  
""You didn't even ask if I was okay after the fire,"" he said, a hint of accusation in his voice.  
  
I finally looked up. ""You seemed to have Chloe taking excellent care of you.""  
  
My voice was flat. Devoid of the concern he was used to.  
  
He frowned. Usually, I'd be fussing over him, even a minor cough would send me into a flurry of maternal care.  
  
Not anymore. That Ava was gone.  
  
""Right,"" he said. He shifted his weight. ""Well, Dad would be proud you're pursuing your architecture again. He always said you had a real talent.""  
  
My father. The man whose dying wish had trapped me in this sham of a marriage.  
  
The irony was bitter.  
  
""Yes, he did,"" I said.  
  
I took a breath. It was now or never.  
  
""Ethan, we need to talk.""  
  
""About what?"" He was already pulling out his phone. ""Chloe just texted. Her insurance adjuster is being a nightmare.""  
  
He started tapping out a reply, his brow furrowed in concentration.  
  
I watched him. The way his thumb flew across the screen. The intense focus.  
  
All for her.  
  
My resolve hardened further. This was the right decision.  
  
He looked up, pocketing his phone. ""Sorry, what were you saying?""  
  
""Nothing important,"" I said. It could wait. My lawyer had the papers ready.  
  
""Good. Because I have a surprise for you,"" he said, a sudden, almost boyish grin on his face. ""It's our anniversary, after all.""  
  
My heart gave a st\*pid little flutter. Hope, that tenacious weed.  
  
""I made a reservation. Chic new restaurant. Meatpacking District. Eight o'clock.""  
  
He even had a bouquet of roses. Expensive, long-stemmed white roses. My favorites.  
  
And a sleek designer gift bag.  
  
For a moment, a tiny, treacherous moment, I wondered if I was wrong.  
  
If maybe, just maybe, he remembered. Cared.  
  
We arrived at the restaurant. It was buzzing. Trendy crowd, low lighting, loud music.  
  
""Table for Cole?"" Ethan said to the hostess.  
  
She smiled brightly. ""Right this way, Mr. Cole! Ms. Vance is expecting you!""  
  
Ms. Vance?  
  
My bl\*\*d turned to ice.  
  
And there she was. Chloe.  
  
Standing by a prime table, beaming.  
  
It was her restaurant. The grand opening.  
  
The roses in Ethan's hand. He presented them to Chloe with a flourish.  
  
""Congratulations, Chloe! They're beautiful, just like you.""  
  
The designer gift bag. He handed it to her. ""A little something for the new venture.""  
  
Chloe squealed, pecking him on the cheek. ""Ethan! You shouldn't have!""  
  
She ripped open the bag. A limited-edition designer handbag. One she'd posted about on Instagram for weeks.  
  
""Oh my god, it's the one! How did you even find it?""  
  
Ethan just smiled, basking in her adoration.  
  
And me? I was standing there. Holding Chloe's bouquet of roses because Ethan had thrust them at me when he went to hug her.  
  
A prop. That's all I was.  
  
The prop wife at the other woman's celebration, paid for by my husband, on our anniversary.  
  
I opened the ledger app on my phone under the table.  
  
""Anniversary dinner was a setup for Chloe's restaurant opening. Flowers and gift were for her. I was the prop. -15 points.""  
  
Total: -60.  
  
  
Chapter 4  
Chloe linked her arm through Ethan's, pulling him through the crowded restaurant.  
  
""Let me show you everything, Ethan! It's exactly how we pictured it, remember?""  
  
She chattered about the decor, the menu, the chef she'd poached from a Michelin-starred place.  
  
Ethan listened, rapt, nodding, his eyes shining with pride. For her.  
  
""And this bar,"" Chloe gestured dramatically, ""we designed this on a napkin at that little cafe in Paris, remember? After that awful meeting with your father's bankers?""  
  
Ethan chuckled. ""You spilled coffee all over the first draft.""  
  
""And you redrew it perfectly!"" Chloe squeezed his arm. ""You always knew what I wanted.""  
  
He did. He remembered every detail of her dreams, her whims.  
  
He looked at a specific corner booth. ""That's where you said you'd have your 'power lunch' table.""  
  
Chloe giggled. ""I was ten!""  
  
""But you were serious,"" Ethan said, his voice soft. ""You wanted a place where you felt in charge.""  
  
He looked at her, his expression full of admiration.  
  
""I always wanted to help you build it, Chlo. Even if it was just mixing the cocktails behind the bar.""  
  
His offer hung in the air. A promise from their youth, now reiterated.  
  
Chloe's smile faltered for a fraction of a second. ""Don't be silly, Ethan. You're a top lawyer. You can't be my bartender.""  
  
But her eyes held a different message. A flicker of calculation.  
  
She knew her power over him.  
  
I trailed behind them, invisible.  
  
A ghost at their private party.  
  
Ethan's gaze never left Chloe. He was entirely absorbed in her, in her triumph.  
  
It was like I wasn't even there.  
  
We finally sat down. Ethan ordered champagne. ""To Chloe's success!""  
  
Chloe turned to me, her smile a little too bright. ""Ava, you're so quiet. What will you have to eat? Ethan, what does Ava like?""  
  
The question hung in the air.  
  
Ethan looked blank for a moment.  
  
He actually looked blank.  
  
""Uh,"" he stammered, ""I'm not sure. Ava? What do you feel like?""  
  
He gestured vaguely at the menu in front of me, already turning back to Chloe.  
  
He didn't know. After three years of marriage, he didn't know my favorite foods.  
  
He knew Chloe wanted her steak medium-rare with extra béarnaise, no fries, side salad with lemon vinaigrette. He'd ordered it for her a hundred times.  
  
But me? I was a blank slate.  
  
The pain was a physical thing, a tightening in my ch\*st, a knot in my stomach.  
  
My hands clenched in my lap, nails digging into my palms.  
  
I bit the inside of my lip to stop it from trembling.  
  
""Excuse me,"" I mumbled, pushing my chair back. ""I need some air.""  
  
Chloe followed me to the restroom. Of course, she did.  
  
She leaned against the marble countertop, watching me in the mirror as I splashed cold water on my face.  
  
""He really doesn't know you at all, does he?"" she said, her voice syrupy sweet.  
  
""It's impressive, really. How little of an impression you've made.""  
  
I straightened up, meeting her gaze in the mirror. ""What do you want, Chloe?""  
  
""Want?"" She feigned surprise. ""I have everything I want. Ethan's devotion. My dream restaurant. Success.""  
  
She stepped closer, her reflection looming beside mine.  
  
""He loves me, Ava. He always has. He always will. You were just a… a placeholder. A comfortable, convenient stopgap.""  
  
Her voice dropped to a whisper. ""Don't you think it's time you gracefully bowed out? Before you embarrass yourself further?""  
  
A direct hit. A declaration of war.  
  
Just then, a loud crash echoed from the dining room. Screams.  
  
My heart leaped into my throat.  
  
Fear. Pure, unadulterated fear.  
  
Chloe's eyes widened.  
  
We both ran out.  
  
Chaos.  
  
A huge, ornate light fixture, custom-made, had detached from the ceiling.  
  
It was swinging precariously, then it fell.  
  
Right towards the table where Ethan… where we had been sitting.  
  
Chloe was slightly ahead of me.  
  
Ethan saw it. His eyes locked on Chloe.  
  
In that split second, he moved.  
  
He lunged, shoving Chloe hard. She stumbled, falling clear.  
  
He didn't even glance my way.  
  
I was directly in the path of the falling debris.  
  
A searing pain in my head. Darkness.  
  
Then, nothing.  
  
I woke up slowly.  
  
Th\*\*bbing head. Stinging cuts.  
  
The world was blurry.  
  
I was on the floor. People were shouting.  
  
Through a haze, I saw Ethan.  
  
He was kneeling beside Chloe, who was sobbing hysterically, though she looked unharmed.  
  
He was cradling her, murmuring reassurances, shielding her from the surrounding chaos, from the eyes of the other patrons.  
  
""It's okay, Chloe, I'm here. You're safe.""  
  
He didn't see me. Or if he did, he didn't react.  
  
My vision tunneled. The last thing I saw was Ethan, his back to me, completely focused on Chloe.  
  
Then, blackness again.  
  
When I opened my eyes next, I was in a hospital b\*d.  
  
Alone.  
  
The pain in my head was a dull, constant ache. My arm was bandaged. Stitches.  
  
A concussion, the nurse told me later. Deep cuts from the glass.  
  
I fumbled for my phone. The ledger.  
  
My hand was shaking so badly I could barely type.  
  
""Restaurant accident. Saved Chloe, ignored me. -15 points.""  
  
Total: -75.  
  
A nurse bustled in. ""Oh, you're awake! How are you feeling, dear?""  
  
She saw my phone. ""Still working? You're a dedicated one.""  
  
She noticed the screen. ""Breaking Point Ledger? Points? What's that, some kind of game?""  
  
Her eyes scanned the entries. ""Minus 75 points… getting close to the end, are we?""  
  
She chuckled, thinking it was a joke.  
  
I didn't smile.  
  
Just then, the door opened.  
  
Ethan.  
  
He heard the nurse's last words. ""…getting close to the end, are we?""

Hey, MaximizeMe fam! 🙌

So, let’s dive right into something we all desperately need—time! Have you ever wished you could just hit a button and make some of your daily tasks disappear? I mean, wouldn’t that be FLIPPING amazing? 😅 

Picture this: it’s Saturday morning, and instead of cleaning the house or doing laundry, you’re sipping coffee, binge-watching that show everyone’s been talking about. Yeah, that’s the dream! 

Here are a few tasks I’d LOVE to automate (and honestly, I wouldn’t mind if you join me on the wish train):

- **Meal Prep**: 🙅‍♂️ Who loves spending hours chopping veggies and cooking? Not me! If only I had a robotic chef that could whip up healthy meals in a snap. I’m talking about *gourmet-level* stuff, not just toaster waffles! 
- **Email Management**: 📧 Ever feel like it's just you vs. an endless sea of emails? If I could automate sorting, replying, and even deleting the spam, I’d reclaim so much mental space to focus on the fun stuff!
- **Grocery Shopping**: 🛒 I love the idea of auto-drafting my grocery list based on what I ate last week! Who has time to remember if they need more eggs or if they’re stocked up on that *unpopular brand of almond milk*? 
- **Decluttering**: 🧹 Wouldn’t it be great to have a little robot with a vacuum cleaning my space while I kick back? It’s like having a tiny housekeeper who isn’t judging you for that pile of laundry on the chair. 😏

And they say, “Work smarter, not harder,” right? Now I know we can’t literally automate everything (sorry, dreams of ordering a pie-in-the-sky assistant), but just humor me for a second. What if you could take one task and hand it off? Like a little time-off gift to yourself?

Imagine all the things you could do with that reclaimed time. Maybe you could dive into that new hobby, catch up with friends, or even just take a much-needed nap! 💤

Let’s be real; *life is short*, and we all deserve to enjoy it a little more. So if you had the chance to tap your heels and automate just ONE task—what would it be? 

Think about it. I’m sure there are more tasks we’d like to offload, and maybe there’s an app or gadget out there that can help! Who knows, together we might just find the ultimate loophole in our schedules! 

So, what’s your pick? 🤔",1,1749811630.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

""Tonight, we take over Gangdong.""

He didn’t wait for the ceremony.

His fists spoke first — a blur of sharp jabs and brutal crosses, each strike landing with the dull thud of authority. Cheoldun reeled, his guard breaking like damp cardboard. Hyeon Bae danced forward, pivoting into a hook that clipped the jaw and sent spit flying. He wasn't just punching — he was carving a message into the night.

But Cheoldun wasn’t done yet — Hyeon had misread the fire in him.  
**BAM! BAM! BAM!**  
The strikes were wild, raw, *unrefined* — but they carried weight, and Hyeon felt every one. Bone met bone. Elbow met cheek. Fist met gut.

Just as Hyeon pulled his arms up to guard—  
**WHABAM!**  
A knee soared straight into his groin.  
**crack.**

He lurched. Spat.  
His eyes rolled back as pain shot through his spine like lightning.  
His balls had been *nearly crushed*.

Jittering and gasping like a madman, Cheoldun *clinched in close* — and then *smashed* his forehead into Hyeon’s fists, knuckles cracking on impact.  
Pain shot through Hyeon’s fingers. He hissed, then roared. With both fists, he shoved Cheoldun away like a wild dog.

“Y-you... filthy... homeless **bum**!”

Staggering back, Hyeon fumbled through his pockets, feet skidding.  
Cheoldun lunged — teeth bared, eyes wide.

*PSSSSSHHH!*

Without hesitation, Hyeon whipped out a can and unloaded a stream of mosquito spray straight into Cheoldun’s face.  
A chemical *storm*. Right between the eyes.

""HAH! THIS'LL TEACH YOU, B—""  
**BAM!**

A thunderous overhand hook crashed into Hyeon’s face — his nose *crumpled* like foil.  
Blood sprayed. The world tilted.

“You... think... that stops... me?”  
Cheoldun’s voice was gravel — his teeth clenched, eyes shut against the searing burn.

He took one trembling step forward—  
—and *dropped* his elbow like a guillotine.

**CRUSH!**  
A sickening crack echoed.  
Hyeon’s rib gave way under the slam.

Cheoldun wavered. He tried to rise, limbs shaking, body screaming in protest — but he moved. He *still* moved.

Hyeon snarled and launched a punch that sent him staggering — Cheolbong reeled as Hyeon’s phone buzzed in his pocket.

He scoffed.  
“What does this *midget* want now?”  
He swiped the call.

“Hello?”  
A pause.  
“What do you mean, *come back*?”  
“Alright. Alri—”

**BAM!**

The sentence died.  
A blur. A gleam. A *scream* in the form of steel.

Something tore through Hyeon like a whisper made of razors — splitting flesh, rending fabric.  
He didn’t fall. He came apart.

“Look what we’ve got here... a *Gangnamer*.”  
Dae muttered, gazing down at the wreck that was once Hyeon.

Behind her, a tall girl with platinum-blonde hair stepped through the carnage, eyes cool as ice.

“That kid could’ve just *called* us,” she sighed, strutting toward the fallen boy with casual disdain.

Then — without pause, without mercy —  
*STOMP.*  
*STOMP.*  
*STOMP.*

She crushed him into the pavement until her knees were painted in his blood.

“Moshi moshi?” she chimed sweetly, lifting her phone to her ear.  
“What’s up, little man?”

With a roar and a blur of motion, Yang Jin *crashed down* on Kyubok — the elbow strike landing like divine judgment.

One hit. That was all it took.  
Kyubok slumped, broken and still, as the arena lights flickered on with a mechanical *hum*.

Yang Jin winced.  
Eyes shut, guard up — not from an opponent, but the sudden blaze of artificial day.  
And then—

*Thud.*

A small package landed squarely on his head.

He blinked.  
""What the hell was that?""

Without a moment to spare, **Sieun** slipped into his uniform — a fitted red shirt, sharp against his pale skin, tucked into clean black pants. A matching red apron hugged his waist like it belonged there. Simple. Practical. Yet on *him*, it felt like runway couture.

“**Great! Our moneymaker's here!**”  
Another waiter grinned from behind the counter, tossing a dishcloth over his shoulder with theatrical flair.

“*All hands on deck…*”  
A quieter one muttered, eyes widening as the first customer gasped audibly from the door. His face turned pale like he’d just seen royalty — or maybe a ghost made of starlight.

Sieun approached the counter with that usual hesitant grace, brushing a stray strand from his hair from earlier mischief. His expression was calm, professional, but his very presence pulled gazes like a magnet.

Despite the simple get-up, **there was nothing ordinary about him**.  
Slender as a reed, soft as silk, and yet… something in his golden eyes shimmered like sunlight caught in amber. His beauty *defied labels*, slipping between boyish charm and ethereal allure with every blink.

He didn’t need makeup.  
Didn’t need flair.  
Sieun simply *was* — and that was enough to quiet the room.

A larger waiter sighed heavily as he returned to the counter.  
“Before we do that…” he slumped onto the floor. “We need someone… to save our stock.”

The other waiters went pale.

D-don’t tell me…” they whispered among themselves, with Sieun left clueless.

**“The mukbanger is here?!”** they yelped, practically carrying each other.

What on earth were his co-workers yammering about?!

Sung Wu had picked up Kyeok Sul Do relatively easily… his time with his master had been well spent.  
Now… he was ready to be deployed.

He sat quietly while his master took a slow swig of coffee, darker than the tarmac on the roads outside.  
His leg bounced restlessly as a question, nearly dead, stirred inside him.  
He knew enough to understand—tangos need two.

But *who*?

*Who* was the man who danced with his teacher?

Then, Chloe Vance, his ex-girlfriend and now stepmother, cornered me in a powder room with a cruel bet: ten chances to make Ethan publicly claim me, or I'd sign divorce papers and disappear.  
Each attempt to win his affection ended in public h\*miliation.  
He remained cold, his attention always on Chloe, who openly delighted in my torment.  
He looked at me with disgust when I tried to bridge the distance, abandoned me in a fire, and watched me suffer an acid attack - his only concern for her.  
Despite my agony, he later tried to make me take the fall for her sordid scandals.  
How could the man I loved treat me with such brutal indifference, repeatedly choosing his ex-girlfriend while I withered?  
Was I merely a convenient shield, a secret to be hidden, while his true devotion remained with another woman?  
The casual cruelty, the dismissive betrayal, chipped away at everything I believed.  
Watching him side with her after that horrific attack, something inside me irrevocably shattered.  
My foolish, stubborn love for Ethan Gold finally, completely died.  
I decided then that I wouldn't just leave; I would reclaim my life and dignity, severing every last tie to the man who never truly saw me.  
And he would finally understand what he had lost.  
  
  
Chapter 1  
Chloe Vance cornered Ava Chen in the powder room of the St. Regis.  
  
Her voice, smooth as poisoned honey, cut through the air.  
  
""Ava, darling. We need to talk about Ethan.""  
  
Ava's heart hammered.  
  
Ethan Gold, her husband. A secret husband, thanks to the war between their families, the Chens and the Golds.  
  
And Chloe, Ethan's first love, now his widowed stepmother.  
  
""What about Ethan?"" Ava tried to keep her voice steady.  
  
Chloe smiled, a flash of perfect white teeth.  
  
""He's mine, Ava. He always has been. But you're a persistent little thing.""  
  
She leaned closer, her expensive perfume cloying.  
  
""So, a wager. Ten chances. Ten public events, or significant private moments. Make Ethan publicly claim you, show real love. Not just a polite arm on your elbow.""  
  
Ava felt a chill. ""And if I don't?""  
  
""All ten failures?"" Chloe's eyes gleamed. ""You sign the divorce papers I'll have ready. No fuss, no fight. You just disappear from his life. And mine.""  
  
Ava thought of Ethan. His rare smiles, the stolen moments that felt like sunshine.  
  
She loved him. She truly believed she could win his heart, break through his cold exterior.  
  
""I accept,"" Ava said, her voice barely a whisper, but firm.  
  
Chloe's smile widened. ""Excellent. The annual Gold Foundation Gala is next week. Let that be your first test.""  
  
Ava's initial confidence was a fragile thing.  
  
At the Gala, she reached for Ethan's hand on the red carpet.  
  
He was a statue, his fingers stiff, pulling away subtly as photographers flashed.  
  
Later, she saw him in a quiet corner, deep in conversation with Chloe, who looked artfully distressed.  
  
Chloe caught Ava's eye and gave a tiny, triumphant smirk.  
  
One down. Nine to go.  
  
The failures piled up. A charity dinner, a weekend at his parents' estate (now Chloe's too, in a way), a business conference. Each time, Ethan was distant, his attention fixed on Chloe's feigned needs, her ""fragility.""  
  
Desperation gnawed at Ava. This was attempt number four.  
  
They were at the Gold family's desolate Hamptons beach house. Ethan was working, as usual.  
  
Ava had read about aph\*\*disiacs online. A tasteless powder.  
  
She slipped it into his whiskey, her hands trembling.  
  
She just wanted him to look at her, to touch her with something other than indifference.  
  
He took a sip, then another.  
  
A flush crept up his neck. He looked at her, a strange light in his eyes.  
  
For a moment, Ava's hope surged.  
  
Then, his expression hardened. He stood up, his chair scraping loudly.  
  
""What did you do?"" His voice was ice.  
  
Ava stammered, ""Nothing, I just...""  
  
""Don't lie to me, Ava."" He gripped her arm, his fingers like steel. ""You think you can trick me into... this?""  
  
He looked at her with pure disgust.  
  
""Pathetic.""  
  
The word struck her harder than a slap.  
  
He released her, turning his back. ""I'm going out.""  
  
""Ethan, please...""  
  
He didn't look back. He just walked out, leaving her alone in the vast, silent house.  
  
Later that night, Olivia, Ava's sister, sent her a link to a gossip site.  
  
Paparazzi photos. Ethan, looking concerned, ""comforting"" a tearful Chloe outside an exclusive Hamptons club.  
  
The caption read: ""Ethan Gold rushes to stepmother Chloe Vance's side after a trying day.""  
  
Ava stared at the screen, the image blurring through her tears.  
  
He left her, alone and humiliated, to rush to Chloe.  
  
The realization was a cold, heavy stone in her stomach. Chloe was his priority. Always.  
  
The next morning, Chloe called. Ava saw her name on the caller ID and almost didn't answer.  
  
""Darling Ava,"" Chloe purred. ""Did you have a lonely night? Ethan was such a comfort. He said the sea air was doing wonders for my nerves.""  
  
Ava felt sick. Chloe was gloating.  
  
""Four down, sweetie. Only six more public embarrassments before you sign those papers. I have them drafted already, you know. Very neat, very tidy.""  
  
Ava hung up, her hand shaking.  
  
She sank onto the cold tile floor of the beach house bathroom.  
  
Defeated. This attempt, this desperate, foolish act, had been a disaster.  
  
Her marriage felt like a hollow shell. What was she even fighting for?  
  
A man who looked at her with contempt?  
  
She remembered the first time she saw Ethan Gold.  
  
It was at a university lecture. He was a guest speaker, already a young titan in the real estate world.  
  
He wasn't handsome in a conventional way. He was sharp, intense, with eyes that seemed to see everything.  
  
There was an energy about him, a controlled power that fascinated her.  
  
She'd been a naive design student, full of romantic notions. He was different. He was a challenge.  
  
Then, a few months into their cautious, secret dating, Olivia had told her.  
  
""Ava, you need to know about Ethan Gold and Chloe Vance.""  
  
Olivia, ever the pragmatic lawyer, laid out the facts.  
  
Chloe had been Ethan's first serious girlfriend. A p\*\*sionate, tumultuous a\*\*air.  
  
Then, Chloe had shocked everyone by marrying Ethan's much older, incredibly wealthy father, Arthur Gold.  
  
""He still wears that silver watch Chloe gave him years ago,"" Olivia had said. ""The one she had engraved.""  
  
Ava had noticed the watch. Ethan never took it off.  
  
One evening, desperate to understand, Ava had gone to a charity event she knew Arthur and Chloe Gold would attend. Ethan was there too, ostensibly for business.  
  
From a shadowed alcove, she saw them.  
  
Chloe, beautiful and radiant, laughing up at Ethan.  
  
He wasn't looking at his father. He was looking at Chloe.  
  
Then, Chloe had leaned in, whispered something. Ethan's hand had gone to her waist, a brief, possessive touch.  
  
Chloe's eyes met Ava's across the crowded room, a flicker of triumph in them before she turned back to Ethan.  
  
Devastation washed over Ava. It was real. Their bond was real.  
  
Still, Ava had persisted.  
  
She told herself she could be better for Ethan than Chloe.  
  
She could offer him stability, genuine love, not the drama Chloe thrived on.  
  
She chased him, with little self-respect, she now admitted.  
  
She ignored the warning signs, the way he always kept a part of himself back.  
  
Then came the secret marriage.  
  
Their families, the Chens and the Golds, were locked in a bitter business rivalry that spanned generations.  
  
A public union was unthinkable.  
  
""We'll tell them when the time is right, Ava,"" Ethan had promised. ""When things calm down.""  
  
He'd slipped a simple gold band on her finger in a sterile courthouse office.  
  
No family, no friends. Just a shared secret.  
  
But the time was never right. His promises remained empty. He was always busy, always distant.  
  
He consistently rejected her attempts at intimacy, at building a real marriage.  
  
""Not now, Ava, I have an early meeting.""  
  
""I'm tired, Ava.""  
  
Sometimes, he'd look at her with a flicker of something unreadable, then turn away.  
  
He'd make her feel cheap for wanting her own husband.  
  
The hypocrisy was staggering, given what she knew about him and Chloe.  
  
Now, Arthur Gold was dead. Chloe was free, a wealthy widow.  
  
And she was openly, cruelly, playing her game with Ava.  
  
This bet, these ten chances, felt like Chloe tightening the noose.  
  
Ava had tried everything. S\*\*uctive lingerie, his favorite meals, trying to engage him in conversations about his work, her work, anything.  
  
He'd look through her, or worse, at her with that polite, chilling indifference.  
  
The memory of his face last night, the disgust, the single word: ""Pathetic.""  
  
That insult, more than anything, had cracked something deep inside her.  
  
His love, the love she'd pinned all her hopes on, wasn't just absent; it felt like it had never existed for her at all.  
  
He wasn't just emotionally stunted. He was actively cruel, using her.  
  
She was a shield. A placeholder. A secret to be managed, not a wife to be cherished.  
  
His public image was a carefully constructed facade. The driven, ascetic business leader.  
  
Underneath, he was a man tethered to a toxic past, to a woman who played him like a violin.  
  
A small, bitter part of Ava acknowledged the failure of this latest, desperate attempt.  
  
The thought of leaving, truly leaving, began to take root, a tiny, bitter seed.  
  
Chloe's voice echoed in her mind, ""Six more public embarrassments.""  
  
San Francisco. Her family was there. The Serene Collection had its headquarters there.  
  
It was an island of sanity in her churning world.  
  
But the bet wasn't over. Not yet. She had made a promise.  
  
  
Chapter 2  
Ethan Gold returned to the Hamptons beach house late the next morning.  
  
The air was still thick with the previous night's tension.  
  
Ava was usually up, making coffee, a forced cheerfulness about her.  
  
Today, the house was quiet. Too quiet.  
  
He found her in their bedroom, a suitcase open on the b\*d.  
  
""What are you doing?"" he asked, his voice neutral.  
  
Ava didn't look at him.  
  
She continued folding clothes, her movements precise, almost robotic.  
  
""Packing,"" she said.  
  
""Packing for what? We're here for another two days.""  
  
She finally turned, her eyes holding a new, unreadable expression.  
  
""I have a surprise for you, Ethan. It's related to my departure.""  
  
He frowned. He hated surprises, especially from Ava. They usually involved some emotional demand.  
  
""Don't be dramatic, Ava. If this is about last night...""  
  
""It's about everything, Ethan,"" she said, her voice flat. ""But don't worry. You'll like this surprise.""  
  
She went back to her packing.  
  
He watched her for a moment, a flicker of unease stirring within him.  
  
He dismissed it. Ava was always emotional. She'd get over it.  
  
Ava picked up a framed photo from the nightstand.  
  
It was from their secret wedding day, a rare shot where they both looked almost happy.  
  
She stared at it for a long moment, then walked to the tr\*\*h can and dropped it in.  
  
The sound of the frame hitting the plastic was louder than it should have been.  
  
Ethan's eyes narrowed. ""What was that?""  
  
""Just getting rid of old things,"" Ava said, not looking at him. ""Making space for the new.""  
  
He felt a strange pang. That photo... it was one of the few proofs of their union.  
  
""If you're still upset about last night,"" he began, trying a different tactic, ""I was harsh. We can talk about it. I'll... I'll make it up to you. We can go to that restaurant you like in the city when we get back.""  
  
It was a superficial offering, and he knew it.  
  
His phone buzzed. Chloe.  
  
He glanced at the screen. Her message was urgent. ""Ethan, darling, I need you. The press are hounding me about father's will. It's dreadful.""  
  
He sighed. ""I have to go. Chloe needs me.""  
  
He started for the door.  
  
""Wait,"" Ava said. Her voice was stronger now.  
  
He turned, impatient. ""What is it, Ava?""  
  
""I'm coming with you.""  
  
He stared at her. ""Don't be ridiculous. You know we can't be seen together like that. Especially not now, with Chloe dealing with Arthur's estate.""  
  
He was CEO of Gold Standard Enterprises. He had an image to maintain. Their marriage was a liability.  
  
""But I'm your wife, Ethan,"" Ava said, a strange calm in her voice. ""Shouldn't a wife support her husband when his family is in distress? Or is that role also reserved for Chloe?""  
  
Her logic was a deliberate echo of his own twisted justifications.  
  
He felt a surge of irritation. ""Fine. But stay in the car. And don't cause a scene.""  
  
She nodded, a small, almost imperceptible smile playing on her l\*ps.  
  
As they walked to his car, Ava noticed a small, velvet jewelry box on the passenger seat.  
  
It wasn't hers.  
  
""What's this?"" she asked, picking it up.  
  
Ethan snatched it from her. ""It's nothing. A gift for a business associate.""  
  
He avoided her eyes.  
  
Ava knew. It was for Chloe. Another token of his devotion.  
  
At Chloe's sprawling Hamptons estate, the scene was chaotic. Reporters, photographers.  
  
Ethan immediately went to Chloe, his arm around her shoulder, guiding her through the throng.  
  
He spoke to the press, his voice firm, protective of Chloe.  
  
Ava watched from the car, invisible, forgotten.  
  
She took out her phone and sent a quick telegram to her sister, Olivia, in San Francisco.  
  
""Phase one initiating. Need legal groundwork. A.""  
  
It was a small step, but it was a step towards her own future.  
  
Suddenly, there was a commotion.  
  
A protestor, someone who had lost money in one of Arthur Gold's ruthless deals, lunged at Chloe, shouting.  
  
Ethan reacted instantly, shielding Chloe, pushing her behind him.  
  
He was her protector. Her champion.  
  
Ava watched, a cold clarity settling over her.  
  
This was Ethan. This was her marriage.  
  
  
Chapter 3  
The protestor, a middle-aged man with wild eyes, spat at Ethan.  
  
""You're just like your old man! And her! She's a gold-digging wh\*\*e!""  
  
Ethan's face was a mask of fury.  
  
""Get him out of here,"" he snarled at his security.  
  
Then, to everyone's surprise, Ethan, who rarely drank in public and never before noon, grabbed a bottle of champagne from a nearby ice bucket.  
  
He uncorked it with a loud pop and poured a glass, handing it to Chloe.  
  
""For your nerves, my dear,"" he said, his voice loud enough for the reporters to hear.  
  
He then took a long drink directly from the bottle himself, a defiant gesture.  
  
It was a clear statement. He stood by Chloe. He would break his own rules for her.  
  
""Anyone who bothers Mrs. Vance again will answer to me personally,"" Ethan announced, his eyes sweeping over the crowd.  
  
He then turned, his arm securely around Chloe, and led her into the house.  
  
He didn't even glance towards the car where Ava sat. He had forgotten her completely.  
  
As he moved, his shoulder brushed hard against the car's side mirror.  
  
Ava, who had leaned forward slightly, felt a sharp pain as the mirror, jolted by the impact, swung inwards and struck her temple.  
  
Stars exploded behind her eyes.  
  
Ethan and Chloe disappeared inside.  
  
Ava touched her temple, her fingers coming away sticky with bl\*\*d.  
  
He hadn't even noticed. He hadn't seen her. He hadn't cared.  
  
She had endured so much for this man. The secret marriage, the constant loneliness, his coldness, Chloe's taunts.  
  
For what? For a love that was a mirage?  
  
Her devotion felt foolish, wasted.  
  
She fumbled in her purse for a tissue, pressing it to the cut.  
  
The bleeding wasn't severe, but the thr\*\*bing in her head was intense.  
  
She was alone. Again.  
  
She spent the night in the guest room of the beach house, tending to her wound, the silence of the house amplifying her desolation.  
  
The next morning, her phone rang. It was Chloe.  
  
Ava almost didn't answer, but a morbid curiosity made her press the accept button.  
  
""Ava, darling,"" Chloe's voice was bright, too bright. ""Are you feeling better? Ethan was so worried when he heard you weren't well.""  
  
A lie. Ethan hadn't contacted her.  
  
Then, Chloe's voice dropped, became more int\*\*ate. ""He stayed with me last night, you know. He said he couldn't leave me alone after that dreadful scene. He was so... attentive.""  
  
Ava could hear the rustle of sheets in the background, a low murmur that might have been Ethan's voice.  
  
Rage, cold and sharp, flooded through Ava.  
  
Chloe was deliberately tormenting her.  
  
Ava hung up.  
  
She sat there for a moment, trembling. Then, she picked up her phone again.  
  
She knew a reporter at a prominent gossip blog, someone who owed her a favor from an old interior design project.  
  
She typed out a message, attaching an anonymous tip about Chloe Vance's suspicious financial dealings related to Arthur Gold's estate, hinting at potential fraud. She included specific account numbers she'd once glimpsed on Arthur's desk when she'd been forced to attend a family dinner.  
  
It was a reckless, retaliatory act, born of pain and anger.  
  
Nothing happened immediately. The blog didn't publish anything.  
  
Two days later, back in New York, Ethan called. His voice was curt.  
  
""Ava, get to my office. Now.""  
  
He hung up before she could reply.  
  
The tone of his voice promised a storm.

1lacr12,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToeflAdvice/comments/1lacr12/how_i_scored_105_on_the_toefl_my_stepbystep/,How I Scored 105 on the TOEFL: My Step-by-Step System for 90+,"Hey Reddit,

Let's talk about the TOEFL. I remember scrolling through this subreddit, feeling a knot in my stomach. I saw people posting amazing scores, and I saw people feeling defeated. I was firmly in the second camp. My first cold diagnostic test was an 82, and the 90 I needed for my application felt a million miles away.

This isn't just another ""study hard"" post. This is the exact, detailed, step-by-step system I built from scratch to climb from an 82 to a 105. It’s a machine designed to do one thing: build your skills and confidence methodically so you can walk into that test center and perform. It's long, it's detailed, and it has everything I wish I'd known from day one.

So grab a coffee, get comfortable, and let's dismantle this test together.

# Part 1: The Mindset & The Mission (The 10% That Makes 90% of the Difference)

Before we even look at a single question, we need to get your head in the right place.

**The Mindset Shift:** The TOEFL is **not** a test of your intelligence. It's not a measure of your worth. **It is a test of a very specific, learnable set of skills.** It tests your ability to:

1. Process academic English information quickly.
2. Identify main ideas and supporting details.
3. Synthesize information from different sources (reading and listening).
4. Structure a coherent argument under time pressure.

That’s it. Once you see it as a skills-based game, you realize you can train for it. You are not ""bad at the TOEFL""; you are simply ""untrained."" This guide is your training plan.

**Consistency over Intensity:** You will achieve more by studying for 90 minutes every day for a month than you will by cramming for 8 hours every weekend. Your brain learns through repetition and sleep. This plan is built around consistent, daily effort.

# Part 2: The Foundation - Building Your Headquarters

This is your mission prep. Do not skip this.

# 1. Understand Your Enemy: The TOEFL iBT Format in Detail

You need to know the battlefield like the back of your hand. Here’s a detailed breakdown.

|Section|Tasks|Timing|What It's *Really* Testing|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Reading**|2 Passages, 10 questions each|35 minutes|Can you read for purpose, not pleasure? Can you locate specific information and understand arguments without reading every word?|
|**Listening**|2-3 Conversations, 3-4 Lectures|36 minutes|Can you identify a speaker's purpose, main points, and supporting details from a single listen? Can you take notes that are useful, not just comprehensive?|
|**Speaking**|1 Independent Task, 3 Integrated Tasks|16 minutes|Can you organize your thoughts and speak clearly under extreme time pressure? Can you accurately summarize and connect ideas from what you read and hear?|
|**Writing**|1 Integrated Task, 1 Academic Discussion|29 minutes|Can you structure a logical, well-supported essay? Can you paraphrase and synthesize information without plagiarizing? Can you contribute meaningfully to a discussion?|

# 2. The Diagnostic Test: Your Starting Coordinates

This is non-negotiable. You cannot create a map without knowing your starting point.

* **What to Use:** An **official ETS practice test**. Use the ones from *The Official Guide to the TOEFL iBT* or buy a TPO (TOEFL Practice Online) test from the ETS website. Third-party tests (Kaplan, Princeton Review) are okay for practice later, but their scoring algorithms can be unreliable for a true diagnostic.
* **How to Do It:** Replicate test day perfectly.
   * **Time:** Strict timing for every section. Use a stopwatch.
   * **Environment:** Quiet room, no phone, no distractions.
   * **Effort:** Give it 100%. Don't guess lazily.
* **How to Analyze Your Results (The Important Part):** Don't just look at the score. Create an **Error Log**. A simple spreadsheet is perfect.

|Section|Question #|Question Type|Why I Got It Wrong (Be Honest!)|What to Do Next Time|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Reading|Passage 1, Q7|Inference|I overthought it and chose an option that *could* be true but wasn't directly supported.|Trust the text. If I can't point to a specific sentence that proves my answer, it's wrong.|
|Speaking|Task 3|Fluency/Pauses|I ran out of time because I paused too much trying to find the perfect word.|It's better to use a simple word and finish than to pause and not finish. Focus on flow.|
|Writing|Integrated|Missed a Key Point|My notes on the lecture were messy. I completely missed the professor's second counter-argument.|Refine my note-taking system. Use clear columns for Reading vs. Listening points.|

Your Error Log is the most valuable study tool you will ever create.

# 3. Gather Your Arsenal: A Curated List of Resources

Don't drown in materials. Quality beats quantity every time.

* **The Non-Negotiables (Official ETS Material):**
   1. ***The Official Guide to the TOEFL iBT Test (6th Edition):*** This is the bible. It explains every question type and includes 4 full practice tests.
   2. ***Official TOEFL iBT Tests, Volumes 1 & 2:*** Each book contains 5 more retired, real TOEFL tests. This is your primary source of high-quality practice. You have 14 official tests between these three books.
* **The High-Value Boosters (My Secret Weapons):**
   1. **Magoosh TOEFL (Blog & YouTube):** Their blog posts are fantastic for breaking down specific concepts (e.g., ""How to approach TOEFL Inference Questions""). Their vocabulary lists are also excellent because they are based on frequency.
* **The Free Goldmines:**
   1. **TST Prep (YouTube):** Josh provides great explanations and tons of free practice prompts, especially for Speaking and Writing.
   2. **Note-Taking Practice:** Use academic lectures from sources like TED-Ed, Crash Course, or Khan Academy to practice your Listening note-taking skills in a low-stakes environment.

# Part 3: The Deep Dive - Section-by-Section Battle Plans

This is the core of the system. Let's break down how to conquer each section.

# A. THE READING SECTION (Target: 24+)

* **The Real Challenge:** Mental fatigue and trap answers designed to look correct. The TOEFL Reading section tests precision under pressure.
* **Detailed Question Type Breakdown & Strategy:**

|Question Type|What It's Asking|My Go-To Strategy|Common Trap|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Vocabulary**|What does word ""X"" mean in this context?|Cover the options. Read the sentence and replace ""X"" with your own word. Then, find the option that matches your guess.|Choosing the most common definition of the word, which might be wrong in this specific context.|
|**Factual Information**|""According to the passage, which of the following is true about X?""|Find the keywords in the question. Scan the passage for those exact words or their direct synonyms. The answer is usually in one sentence.|""Not Mentioned"" or ""True, but not what the question asked"" options.|
|**Negative Factual**|""All of the following are mentioned EXCEPT...""|This is a ""find the three true statements"" question. Scan for each option. The one you can't find is the answer.|Getting impatient and picking the first one you can't find immediately. Be methodical.|
|**Inference**|""What can be inferred about X?""|Find the relevant sentence(s). The correct answer is something that *must* be true based on the text. It's a tiny logical step, not a huge leap.|Making a real-world assumption that isn't directly supported by the text. **The answer is in the passage.**|
|**Rhetorical Purpose**|""Why does the author mention X?""|Find ""X."" Read the sentence before it and the sentence after it. Is it an example? A contrast? A definition? The answer is about the *function* of the text.|Choosing an answer that explains *what* X is, not *why* the author put it there.|
|**Sentence Simplification**|""Which sentence best expresses the essential information...?""|Identify the core subject, verb, and object of the original sentence. Find the option that preserves this core meaning. Eliminate any that change the meaning or miss a key part.|Options that are grammatically correct but change the relationship between ideas (e.g., changes ""because"" to ""despite"").|
|**Insert Text**|""Where does the following sentence best fit?""|Read the sentence you need to insert. Look for pronouns (""it,"" ""they,"" ""this"") or transition words (""however,"" ""therefore""). Find the sentence in the passage it logically connects to.|Placing the sentence where it's topically related but grammatically or logically disruptive.|
|**Prose Summary**|Select the 3 choices that express the most important ideas.|**This is a main idea question.** Reread the first sentence of each paragraph. These often contain the main ideas. Your 3 answers will form a good summary of the entire passage.|Choosing options that are supporting details (examples, statistics) or are too specific.|

* **A 60-Minute Reading Power Session:**
   * **(5 mins) Warm-up:** Review 1-2 difficult questions from your Error Log.
   * **(17 mins) Timed Passage #1:** Do one full passage and its 10 questions under strict time.
   * **(10 mins) Review Passage #1:** Check your answers. For every mistake, fill out your Error Log. For every correct answer, ask yourself *why* it was correct.
   * **(17 mins) Timed Passage #2:** Repeat with a new passage.
   * **(10 mins) Review Passage #2:** Repeat the deep review process.
   * **(1 min) Cool-down:** Write down one key takeaway for your next session.

# B. THE LISTENING SECTION (Target: 23+)

* **The Real Challenge:** Maintaining focus for 5-6 minutes and capturing the *structure* of the information, not just random facts.
* **The Art of High-Speed Note-Taking:** Your notes are your lifeline. Don't write sentences. Use a system.
   * **Structure:** For lectures, use a flowchart style. For conversations, split your page into two columns (e.g., S for Student, P for Professor).
   * **Symbols are Faster than Words:**
      * `Main Idea`: Put a box around it or write `MI:`
      * `Cause -> Effect`: `Sunlight -> Photosynthesis`
      * `Contrast/Problem`: `BUT`, `HOWEVER`, `:(`, `P:`
      * `Example`: `ex:`, `e.g.`
      * `Process/Sequence`: `1.`, `2.`, `3.`
      * `Question/Uncertainty`: `?`
      * `Repetition/Emphasis`: `*` (put a star next to it)
   * **Listen for Signposts:** Professors say things like, ""Now let's turn to..."", ""The main problem was..."", ""A good example of this is..."". These are verbal highlighters telling you what's important.
* **A 60-Minute Listening Power Session:**
   * **(5 mins) Warm-up:** Listen to a 3-minute TED-Ed video and take notes. See if you captured the main idea.
   * **(25 mins) Timed Set #1 (1 Lecture, 1 Convo):** Do a full set under timed conditions. Answer questions using **only your notes** first.
   * **(10 mins) Review Set #1:** Now, check the answers and transcripts. Where did your notes fail you? Did you miss a signpost word? Add it to your Error Log.
   * **(15 mins) Targeted Drill:** Listen to another lecture, but this time, don't worry about the questions. Just focus 100% on perfecting your note-taking technique.
   * **(5 mins) Cool-down:** Compare your notes from the first and last exercises. Have they improved?

# C. THE SPEAKING SECTION (Target: 22+)

* **The Real Challenge:** Cognitive overload. You have to listen, read, think, structure, and speak, all in seconds. This is where templates become non-negotiable. They offload the ""structure"" part so you can focus on content.
* **The Templates That Got Me a 26:** (Inspired heavily by GregMat, adapt them to your own voice)
   * **Task 1 (Independent):**
      * **(Stance):** ""Personally, I would have to agree with the idea that \[restate the topic\]. I feel this way for a couple of key reasons.""
      * **(Reason 1):** ""First and foremost, \[your first reason\]. For me, personally, \[elaborate with a 1-2 sentence personal example\].""
      * **(Reason 2):** ""Secondly, \[your second reason\]. To be more specific, \[add a detail or a consequence\].""
      * **(Conclusion):** ""And that's why, on balance, I feel that \[restate stance\].""
   * **Integrated Tasks (General Structure):**
      * **Task 2 (Campus Announcement):** ""The university has announced \[change from reading\]. The student in the conversation \[agrees/disagrees\] with this change. First, he/she argues that \[reason 1 from listening\], which addresses the point in the reading about \[connect to reading\]. Second, he/she also mentions that \[reason 2 from listening\].""
      * **Task 3 (General to Specific):** ""The reading passage defines a concept known as \[term/concept\]. The professor in the lecture then provides a specific example to illustrate this. The professor talks about \[the example, e.g., a specific animal or experiment\], explaining how \[connect the example to the definition from the reading\].""
      * **Task 4 (Lecture Summary):** ""The lecture is about \[topic\] and its two main types/methods. The first type is \[Type 1\]. The professor explains that it works by \[detail/example for Type 1\]. The second type, in contrast, is \[Type 2\]. This is demonstrated by \[detail/example for Type 2\].""
* **A 60-Minute Speaking Power Session (The ""Bootcamp""):**
   1. **Warm-up (5 mins):** Read a paragraph from a news article out loud to get your mouth moving.
   2. **Template Recitation (5 mins):** Recite your 4 templates out loud from memory until they are automatic.
   3. **Drill & Record (40 mins):**
      * Do 2 Task 1 prompts.
      * Do 2 Task 2 prompts.
      * Do 2 Task 3 prompts.
      * Do 2 Task 4 prompts.
      * **Use a timer. Record every single attempt on your phone.**
   4. **Review (10 mins):** Listen back to *one* good attempt and *one* bad attempt. What was the difference? Fill out your Error Log (e.g., ""Pacing was too fast,"" ""Used 'ummm' 5 times,"" ""Forgot to connect back to the reading"").

# D. THE WRITING SECTION (Target: 24+)

* **The Real Challenge:** Writing with clarity, structure, and good grammar under time constraints. Again, templates are your shield.
* **The High-Scoring Templates:**
   * **Task 1 (Integrated Writing):** **Your opinion is irrelevant.** You are a reporter.
      * **(Introduction - 1 para):** ""The reading passage and the lecture are both about \[Topic\]. The author of the article presents three theories about \[Topic\]. However, the professor in the lecture systematically refutes each of these points.""
      * **(Body Paragraph 1 - 1 para):** ""First, the reading passage suggests that \[Point 1 from Reading\]. The lecturer challenges this specific claim. He/she argues that \[Counterpoint 1 from Lecture\], providing details about \[Specific detail from lecture\].""
      * **(Body Paragraph 2 & 3 - 2 paras):** Repeat the exact same structure for points 2 and 3. Use transition words like ""Secondly,"" ""Furthermore,"" ""In contrast,"" ""Finally.""
      * **(Conclusion - Optional but recommended):** ""In conclusion, the professor successfully casts doubt on the theories presented in the reading by providing contradictory evidence.""
      * **Target Word Count:** 220-280 words.
   * **Task 2 (Academic Discussion):** You are a thoughtful student, not a debater.
      * **(Acknowledge & State Stance - 1 para):** ""Hi \[Student Name\], that's a thought-provoking point about \[their idea\]. While I understand your perspective on \[mention their reason\], I tend to lean more towards the idea that \[Your Main Point\].
      * **(Develop Your Point - 1 para):** ""The primary reason for my view is that \[Your main reason\]. A good illustration of this can be seen in \[Provide a strong, specific example from academics, personal experience, or a well-known event\]. This example clearly demonstrates that \[connect the example back to your main point\].""
      * **(Conclusion - 1 para):** ""Therefore, while the opposing view has some merit, I believe that my approach is more effective/practical/beneficial because \[briefly restate your core idea\]. Thanks for starting this interesting discussion! Best, \[Your Name\].""
      * **Target Word Count:** 120-150 words.

# Part 4: The Game Plan - Customizable Study Schedules

Choose the plan that fits your timeline.

# Plan A: The 4-Week Intensive Sprint

* **Best for:** Those with 1-2 hours to study daily.
* **Philosophy:** Balanced skill-building and test simulation.

|Week|Daily Focus (Mon-Fri)|Saturday|Sunday|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**1: Foundation**|1-2 hours: Deep dive into one section per day (Mon: Reading, Tue: Listening, etc.). Learn strategies, build Error Log.|**Full Diagnostic Test.**|**Deep Review Day.** Spend 3 hours analyzing your test and planning Week 2.|
|**2: R & L Focus**|90 mins: 45 min Reading timed practice + 45 min Listening timed practice. 15 min Speaking template drill.|**Mini-Test:** Do just the Reading and Listening sections of a practice test back-to-back.|**Review Day.** Focus on R&L errors.|
|**3: S & W Focus**|90 mins: 45 min Speaking drills (record & review) + 45 min Writing timed practice (both tasks). 15 min vocab review from Error Log.|**Mini-Test:** Do just the Speaking and Writing sections of a practice test back-to-back.|**Review Day.** Focus on S&W errors.|
|**4: Simulation**|90 mins: Targeted practice on your weakest areas identified from the last test.|**Final Full Practice Test.**|**REST.** No studying. Pack your bag, watch a movie, sleep.|

# Plan B: The 2-Month Marathon

* **Best for:** Students or professionals with less daily time (\~1 hour).
* **Philosophy:** Deeper, slower skill acquisition and vocabulary building.
* **Months 1:** Focus on one section per week. Go deep. Read news articles (The Guardian, NYT), listen to podcasts (NPR, BBC), build your core English skills alongside TOEFL-specific strategies.
* **Month 2:** Follow the 4-Week Sprint plan, but you'll be starting from a much stronger base.

# Plan C: The 2-Week ""Emergency"" Cram

* **Best for:** You have a test in 2 weeks and you're panicking.
* **Philosophy:** Triage. Focus on what gives the most points.
* **Week 1:** Days 1-4 are for learning the templates and core strategies for Speaking and Writing. These are the most controllable sections. Days 5-7 are for timed practice on R & L.
* **Week 2:** A full practice test every other day (e.g., Mon, Wed, Fri). The days in between are for **intense review** of those tests. Forget everything else. Just test and review.

# Part 5: Test Day - Executing the Mission

* **The Day Before:** Stop studying by 3 PM. Your brain needs to rest. Pack your bag: ID, confirmation email, water, a healthy snack (banana, nuts). Lay out your clothes. Do something that makes you happy. Sleep 8 hours.
* **Test Day Morning:** Eat a balanced breakfast with protein and complex carbs (oats, eggs), not just sugar. Avoid too much coffee. Arrive at the test center 30 minutes early.
* **During the Test:**
   * **Reading & Listening:** Trust your training. If a question is too hard, make your best guess and **move on**. Don't let one question sink the whole section.
   * **Speaking:** You will be speaking while others are speaking. It's distracting. **Tune them out.** Focus on your microphone and your screen. If you stumble, take a breath and keep going. A slightly imperfect but complete answer is better than a perfect start that you don't finish.
   * **Writing:** Get your templates on the page. For the Integrated task, spend the first 2-3 minutes outlining the points and counterpoints. For the Academic Discussion, spend the first minute brainstorming your example. Structure is everything.

You are more prepared than you think you are.

This test is a challenge, but it is a beatable one. You don't need to be a genius. You just need a system, the discipline to follow it, and the belief that your hard work will pay off. This is the system that worked for me, and I know it can work for you too.

Now go build your own success story. You've got this.

**Feel free to ask me anything below. I'll stick around to answer questions.**

# Chapter 1 Disappointment

On the day I was supposed to get my marriage license, I found myself at city hall bright and early, waiting from 8 AM until it closed.

Just as I was walking out, feeling the curious stares from the crowd, I got a message from Austin Herrera, saying something had come up at work, and we'd need to [reschedule.ac](http://reschedule.ac)

When I got back to our empty house, I opened my phone and saw an Instagram post from Austin's childhood sweetheart: \[Thanks for the birthday gift, Austin.\]

The photo showed a beautiful scene on an island, and in the corner, I could still see a guy with a well-defined physique.

Scrolling through the comments, it was all compliments and a bit of playful envy about having such a great friend.

After giving the post a like, I decided to reach out to my friend. \[Hey, can you set up that blind date you mentioned last time?\]

\*\*\*\*\*

I'd been in love with Austin for six years, and during that time, I'd transformed from a young girl into a woman nearly thirty.

My family had been all about the wedding talk, and I kept bringing up marriage with Austin, but he always seemed to put it off.

Just when I thought I might be done waiting, he surprised me by proposing in public not too long ago.

Today was supposed to be the big day for us to get our license.

Two days ago, my mom called out of the blue, saying, ""Sweetie, I consulted someone, and they say the day after tomorrow is a perfect day for you to get your license.""

I couldn't help but laugh, and of course, Austin heard me. He pulled me into a warm embrace and assured me he was all in for anything I needed.

But then, right before our license appointment yesterday, he suddenly started packing his bags for a business trip. Before he left, he gently ruffled my hair and said, ""Don't worry, it's just for a day. I'll definitely be back in time.""

Looking into his calm eyes, I held back the words I wanted to say. I just smiled as I dropped him off at the airport, feeling happy. Even last night when we talked, he swore he was already at the airport.

Today, I woke up early, put on some light makeup, and headed to the city hall with my driver's license in hand. I couldn't help but daydream about the amazing life we'd have together.

As time ticked by, the fresh rose in my hand slowly wilted. I called Austin multiple times, but none of my calls went through, and I couldn't shake the worry that something might have happened to him.

I even reached out to a coworker who was supposed to be traveling with him, trying to get some intel. Turns out, they hadn't been on any trip at all.

""Ms. Parks, I heard Mr. Herrera took a week off just to get ready for the wedding. I'd be thrilled to attend your wedding,"" the guy said.

""I'll see you then,"" I replied, chuckling weakly before hanging up.

I still found myself wondering if this whole thing was some sort of surprise that Austin was planning for me.

When I finally got home, the place was empty, and as I flipped the lights on, I realized there wasn't going to be any surprise waiting for me after all.

Feeling a bit let down, I collapsed on the couch and tried to clear my mind about what Austin was actually up to.

Just then, I got a message from Austin: \[The company had a temporary issue. We'd have to get the license some other time.\]

I replied with a simple \[Sure.\]

Then, out of curiosity, I opened Instagram and found a post from Austin's childhood sweetheart. \[Thanks for the birthday gift, Austin.\] It was accompanied by a photo of an island.

There was a girl in a cute swimsuit lounging under a coconut tree, donning a wide sun hat and carrying a limited edition bag. And in the reflections of her sunglasses was a solidly-built guy snapping a pic of her.

Yeah, that was definitely Austin off on a supposedly ""temporary"" commitment.

Scrolling through the comments, I saw others lamenting how they wished they had a brother like him.

I couldn't help but chuckle. Honestly, I felt pretty foolish. Just earlier, I was all worried about him, and now here I was, making excuses for his obvious lies.

I was so hopelessly dumb.

A dull ache settled in my chest. I'd been in love with Austin for six long years, and those sweet moments we shared were often tainted by things that didn't really belong to us.

There was his childhood sweetheart, Rosemary Read. Her parents had passed away when she was young, and she ended up being raised in Austin's home, which made them incredibly close, almost like siblings.

On my birthday, I'd find myself blowing out candles alone while he'd get wrapped up in some excuse related to Rosemary. He'd even bring her along on our dates, saying he couldn't leave her alone at home.

And when he finally proposed, he bought her a dress from the same collection he picked for me because, apparently, she liked it too.

All those memories flooded back, and every argument we had over Rosemary ended with that same phrase from him. ""She's just my little sister.""

My heart sank a little deeper, especially knowing he was off vacationing on some island with Rosemary while I sat at home waiting for him.

Six years. How many more of these could I take? Growing up without a father, I always wanted a complete family, dreaming that my future kids would have a happy home.

I smiled bitterly, wiping away the tears that had slipped out.

I even liked this post, hoping he'd take a hint. Then, I turned around and casually messaged a friend: \[Hey, can you set up that blind date you mentioned last time?\]

\*\*\*\*\*

Austin returned home three days later. He walked in with an icy chill hanging around him and stood in the foyer, waiting for me to come help with the bags.

I stayed put on the couch, not giving him a glance.

When I didn't move, he finally spoke up, ""Laurel, I'm home."" I just hummed and kept my eyes glued to the TV.

Noticing something was off, he hung his snow-drenched jacket by the door and made his way over to me. He wrapped me in his arms and softly asked if I was upset.

""Laurel, I'm sorry. That project was a bit tricky,"" he said.

I tuned into his steady heartbeat, which didn't skip a beat even when he lied.

""I saw Rosemary's Instagram,"" I shot back, locking my gaze on him to see how he'd react.

When I dropped Rosemary's name, I could see his face tighten with annoyance, and I could hear it in his voice. ""Rosemary just happened to be there, and I swung by for her birthday. How many times do I have to tell you I think of her like a little sister?""

Just like I thought, he was sticking to the same old script. ""Oh, so you had time for her birthday but no time to give me a call?"" I asked.

During the time I couldn't reach him, my mind raced, wondering if he was safe. I felt a lump in my throat as I fought to hold back tears in front of him.

Austin pressed his lips together and stubbornly added, ""What difference does it make? We still couldn't get a license anyway.""

I looked at him, the guy I'd spent six years with, and felt a wave of disappointment wash over me. For a moment, I didn't even want to argue.

Just then, the doorbell rang. I got up to answer it, and it was Rosemary. She had a big bag in her hand and smiled warmly at me. ""Laurel, you're here. I brought Austin's stuff he left at my place.""

She handed me the bag, revealing a bracelet around her wrist.

My heart dropped when I saw it, and I froze as I took the bag in my hands. That bracelet was special. Austin had traveled to several cities to get it for me.

When he gave it to me, he said, ""I hope this brings you luck.""

Turns out, what I thought was something unique between us, he had given to Rosemary too.

""Sorry, Laurel,"" Rosemary said, her hands together and her head tilted, her eyes wide with innocence.

# Chapter 2 Break Up

""You're not upset that Austin took me on vacation for my birthday, are you?"" Rosemary asked.

I looked at her, not saying a word, and quietly closed the door behind me.

\*\*\*\*\*

I went cold turkey with Austin. Every time we fought about Rosemary, it would spark a silent war. Austin had gotten used to this pattern, knowing that after three days, I'd be back in front of him, ready to make up.

I hadn't even drifted off to sleep when there was a loud knock at my door.

""Laurel!"" Austin shouted, his voice filled with frustration.

I opened the door, and he shoved his phone at me. ""How many times do I have to say it? Rosemary is just my sister! Why do you take it so personally?""

I was clueless. ""What did I do to her?""

""And you have the nerve to ask! Did you say something to her when she came over? Mom said she's been off since she got back, and now she's in the hospital because of her depression!""

I glanced at Austin's phone, the screen showing a picture of Rosemary lying weakly in a hospital bed, her wrist wrapped in thick gauze.

""I didn't say anything to her,"" I said. I was being honest.

Austin said to me sharply with one hand around my neck, ""If anything goes wrong with Rosemary, you can forget about marrying me.""

I wanted to call him a psycho, but I couldn't get half a sound out of my throat, and I frantically scratched at Austin's hand, desperate for him to let me go.

Just when I felt like I might pass out, he threw me to the ground and looked down at me, condescendingly saying, ""After everything we've been through, if you don't go after Rosemary again, I might actually think about marrying you.""

With that, he turned and stormed downstairs, snatching the keys from the table before slamming the door behind him.

I was left sitting on the floor, struggling to catch my breath. It felt like my heart was completely shattered. He made these wild accusations without a shred of proof, and it was like he was losing it over it all.

I wobbled a bit as I pushed myself up, steadying myself against the wall, and grabbed the phone that had been ringing off the hook on the nightstand.

""Laurel, it's been ages! Want to grab a drink?"" It was Erin George, my high school classmate, someone I hadn't seen in years.

She had just landed in Newton City and was only around for a day before she headed back.

Taking a deep breath to steady my nerves, I agreed to meet her.

\*\*\*\*\*

Erin had reserved a fancy dining room and invited a few of our close friends from the area. The vibe was chill as we all caught up, sharing stories from our lives while reminiscing about the good old times.

""So, Laurel, how are things with you and Austin? Still not married?"" Erin shot me a teasing look.

Back in the day, everyone figured Austin and I would end up together since we were high school sweethearts who went to the same college.

I tugged at the collar of my turtleneck sweater, avoiding eye contact as I swirled the wine in my glass before downing it. ""Nope. Guess it just wasn't meant to be.""

Polly Maxwell frowned, leaning in. ""Is it you or him who doesn't want it anymore?""

""It's him,"" I replied, feeling the weight of those words.

Suddenly, Polly slammed her hand on the table hard enough to send her fork clattering to the ground. ""Is it because of Rosemary? I warned you ages ago that she'd always be in the way between you two, but you wouldn't listen!""

I couldn't help but let out a bitter laugh and shake my head. I always thought Austin just liked pampering his ""sister.""

""Rosemary?"" Laura Watson chimed in, pulling out her phone to show us something.

She played a video that caught everyone's attention: there was Rosemary, wildly banging on a middle-aged guy with her heel. The man held her wrists firmly and was telling bystanders, ""My wife is just having a tantrum, so don't mind her.""

With tears in her eyes, Rosemary was begging, ""No, please help me!""

The video ended with a tall guy standing up to confront the burly man, announcing that the police were on their way. Just before he left, the burly guy leaned in to whisper something threatening to Rosemary.

""It went viral in my neighborhood—everyone was saying the guy was a psychopath and warned to be careful when going out."" Laura looked at me, her eyes filled with pity. ""It looked like Rosemary.""

""It's her,"" I said calmly, unable to shake the unsettling feeling.

The woman in the video looked just like Rosemary, from her hair to the outfit she wore.

Austin had vaguely mentioned that Rosemary had been molested as a child, leaving her with deep psychological scars. I couldn't help but think the psycho had something to do with her suicide.

""Quit bringing her up. I told you Austin's no good for you. When the hell are you finally gonna dump him?"" Polly, a bit tipsy, shot me a disapproving look, like she was ready to jump on me if I said I still had feelings for Austin.

Outside, the rain drizzled against the window, and I noticed a dull ache from the bruise on my neck.

I stared at the raindrops sliding down the glass, feeling a bit lost. ""Just a couple more days.""

\*\*\*\*\*

A week later, Austin got in touch again. The whole Rosemary situation had somehow made the news, and I followed it reluctantly.

The report said the man was in a psychiatric hospital, and the girl who was involved was under close protection by her family.

I knew Austin was aware of the truth. When he called, instead of apologizing, he casually informed me he'd be home for dinner tonight. I shrugged it off, ""Anything else?""

The agent waited patiently for me to sign the contract, and I double-checked everything before putting my name down. Austin was quiet for a while, then finally said, ""Laurel, about the other day, I...""

I kept silent, waiting for him to continue. In the end, I didn't get the apology I expected. Instead, he blurted out, ""Let's get married, Laurel. I'll meet you at the city hall tomorrow.""

I couldn't help but smile ironically, feeling an unusual heaviness in my heart.

Had I been so indulgent with him over the years that I'd given him the impression this was how to make it up to me? Did he really think I was that easy to brush aside?

""No, thanks,"" I replied.

His displeasure was clear. ""What do you mean, no?""

I strolled over to the window to take in the view of Newton City, a place I'd been stuck in for what felt like ages. I moved here for Austin since his whole family was based in this city.

I saved up every penny to buy this house, hoping that one day, if I got married, my mom would come to live here with me. It'd make it easier to care for her.

But honestly, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being pretty selfish, making her move to a strange city just for me. Right now, though, I'd never felt more sober.

""I mean, we're done,"" I said.

Austin was about to say more when I heard Rosemary's voice blaring on the other end. ""Austin, where are you?""

He left me a quick, irritated ""Cut it out"" and hung up.

The agent beside me pretended not to notice the commotion and flashed a smile, saying, ""Ms. Parks, the funds will arrive within 24 hours.""

I nodded and handed him the key. ""Thanks. Here you go.""

# Chapter 3 Choices

After selling the house, I drove back to the place I shared with Austin and opened the door to an eerie stillness.

It seemed Austin hadn't been around for a while—he'd been busy taking care of Rosemary at the hospital.

I couldn't help but smirk a little. Honestly, that was fine by me. I'd rather not run into him.

Most of my stuff was in the second bedroom, and over the years, I'd had my fair share of arguments with Austin about Rosemary.

I had spent my time in that room during the rough patches and felt like I was constantly keeping my head down.

A bitter smile crept across my face as I packed up my things, remembering how submissive I used to be.

I didn't bother keeping anything that reminded me of Austin. Two hours later, I wiped the beads of sweat off my forehead with a tissue, feeling a mix of exhaustion and relief.

Then, my phone rang. I glanced at the caller ID and saw it was my mom. I hesitated for a second before answering. ""Hey, Mom.""

Her voice was filled with that familiar mix of excitement and nostalgia. ""Laurel, how's it going? Have you gotten the license yet? Have you and Austin talked about the wedding plans?""

I felt something tighten in my throat as I opened my mouth, but nothing came out.

There was a long, awkward silence, and when my mom began to press me, I took a deep breath, fighting back tears. ""Mom, I'm not getting married.""

""What do you mean, Laurel? What's going on?"" Her tone turned anxious.

I tried to explain, ""I just don't think Austin and I are right for each other.""

Her voice rose slightly. ""But Laurel, you've been together forever! Why say this now, right before the wedding? Come on, you're 27, not a kid anymore.""

It struck me that without even asking what I was feeling, she just urged me to get married.

Tears filled my eyes, and I had to cover my mouth to keep from breaking down. After what felt like forever, I found my voice, ""Mom, I really just don't want to marry him.""

My mom didn't hold back her frustration. ""So what do you want, then? Just give up on all these years?""

When she heard my firm answer, her tone shifted. ""Laurel, how can you just say you don't want this after all this time?""

""Well, I just said it,"" I shot back, feeling overwhelmed.

My mom's voice suddenly went all high-pitched, probably still trying to convince me, and before she could make a sound, I heard a dull thud from the other end of the line.

""Mom?"" I called out but got no response.

A wave of panic hit me like a freight train. ""Mom! What's wrong? Please answer me!""

All I could make out was a faint moan of pain coming from her. My heart clenched tight, and I hung up in a hurry, flipping on the home security feed.

In my panic, my phone slipped from my shaking hands, sliding under the couch like it was covered in grease.

I dropped to my knees, desperately reaching for my phone. The security footage showed my mom, clearly in distress, clutching her chest and reaching for her medicine on the table.

All I wanted to do was dive through the screen and hand her the pills she needed.

I had only one thought racing through my mind: save my mom. I quickly opened my contacts and dialed my aunt, Bonnie Porter, who lived in the same building with my mom.

""Come on, pick up!"" I pleaded, praying she'd answer fast.

The ten seconds felt like an eternity, but finally, Bonnie picked up. I burst into tears, sounding like a total mess as I exclaimed, ""Aunt Bonnie, my mom is having an attack! You need to hurry!""

Bonnie sounded surprised but jumped into action, heading over to my mom's place while trying to calm me down.

I hung up and immediately called for an ambulance, anxiously switching back to the feed, just hoping someone would get to my mom in time.

At that moment, I regretted everything about moving to Newton City alone and leaving my mom all by herself. Watching her suffer through a screen felt like a nightmare.

I couldn't help but blame myself for being so hasty in talking to her and pushing her buttons.

The self-loathing and regret were overwhelming. I shouldn't have done that. I was so wrong. I promised myself, never again.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity of two minutes, I heard the doorbell chime, signaling that Bonnie had entered the house.

She rushed in, looking almost like an angel descending from above, and quickly administered the medicine from the table to my mom.

Through the monitor, I watched as my mom's pale expression started to ease up while my phone slipped weakly to the floor.

Bonnie called me to let me know that my mom was out of danger, and I insisted she take her to the hospital for a follow-up.

It wasn't until I hung up that I felt like I'd regained my sanity, and my heart, which was racing like crazy, finally calmed down.

Taking a deep breath, I picked up the pace with my packing. The thought of leaving Newton City was getting harder to shake off.

The moving guys were still on their way, so I was waiting and checking in with Bonnie about my mom's condition when, out of nowhere, Austin appeared right in front of me.

The sound of the bouquet hitting the floor snapped me out of my phone trance, and I was taken aback by his sudden presence.

He was all dressed up in a sharp suit and tie, with his hair styled just right, showing off a smooth forehead that gave him a touch of mature charm. A bunch of delicate roses lay discarded at his feet.

His eyes looked stormy, filled with suppressed anger as he gritted out, ""Laurel, what do you mean by that?""

""Didn't I tell you? I want to break up. Do you not get it?"" My emotions were all over the place, and I was starting to lose my patience, saying whatever popped into my head.

He kicked the coffee table in frustration, sending glass flying, and pointed at the photo I had tossed in the trash, shouting angrily, ""I'm going to get a marriage license with you today. What do you mean?""

So that was why he dressed up—he thought we were heading to get a license. I assumed he dressed to the nine to pick up Rosemary from the hospital.

""I don't need that—"" I tried to shoot back.

Before I could finish, he cut me off, ""Didn't I promise to marry you? What do you want? Are you done with your little tantrum? If you don't marry me, what are you going to say to your mom?""

Looking at his smug face, I couldn't help but think he knew how much my mom had been looking forward to my wedding for ages.

So he knew all the time. He kept me waiting for three long years before finally agreeing to marry me, fully aware of my mom's situation.

It was just heartbreaking. What was I even doing falling for him?

I found myself staring at Austin in silence, my eyes reflecting a deep emptiness.

His anger started to fade as he seemed to regain some composure, and he began to softly coax me, ""I was wrong to stand you up, Laurel. Can we move past this?""

My resolve started to waver, but not because of him—it was all about my mom. I really worried that she would get so upset over everything that it would send her into another health scare.

She'd been adamant about me starting a family, and she'd definitely prefer Austin, the guy I've been in love with for years, over some blind date she barely knew.

That bruise on my neck was a constant reminder that I shouldn't just give in. But my mom was still stuck in that hospital bed, and it stopped me cold.

Just as I was about to crack, something unexpected happened that helped me decide what to do.

# Chapter 4 Just A Bad Dream

At that moment, a figure suddenly appeared, and I was taken aback to see Rosemary standing right in front of me.

She looked drained and pale, wearing a white dress that did nothing to hide her distress.

""Laurel, are you mad at Austin?"" Rosemary's eyes were glossy with unshed tears, and there was a mix of fear and helplessness in her expression.

She continued, her voice cracking, ""It's all my fault. I didn't clarify things with Austin, and that's what led to the misunderstanding between you two.""

I remained silent, my gaze fixed on Rosemary.

""Please, don't be angry with him. I'm truly sorry,"" she pleaded, clearly overwhelmed. ""Austin has been planning for ages to get a marriage license with you."" She bit her lip, looking extremely weak.

I was about to reply when Austin, whose face was dark with frustration, said, ""Laurel, enough already. Rosemary came here to apologize—what more do you want from her?""

I noticed the bruise on her wrist, wrapped in cloth, and shifted my attention to Austin, ""Austin, how about you make a choice? You can either have me or Rosemary.""

""That's enough, Laurel!"" he snapped, glaring at me as though he could burn a hole right through me.

The answer had been clear for a while, but here I was, still holding on. Not for him, but for myself. Six years. How did I lose myself in all this and end up loving a guy like him? I had no idea.

I looked at Austin, trying to keep my cool, and gave a faint smile. ""So, if I go celebrate another guy's birthday, hang around when he's sick, and baby him every now and then, does that make me just some shameless woman in your eyes?""

""Laurel, Austin and I are not what you think,"" Rosemary mumbled, her surprise evident.

""Come on, Rosemary. You know Austin and I are getting married, so why do you keep showing up looking all innocent? You're playing the role of the 'good girl' pretty well,"" I shot back.

With those words, Rosemary froze, disbelief written all over her face, and then she burst into tears.

Pop! Austin's brow furrowed in anger as he stared at me, who had been slapped to the ground by him.

""Laurel,"" Rosemary's reaction was immediate as she rushed to help me.

But I caught a glimpse of a smirk creeping onto her lips just before she lowered her gaze. It was quick but telling.

""Fuck off!"" The words flew out before I could stop myself, and Rosemary stumbled back a couple of steps.

""Laurel,"" Austin said, his eyes heavy with disappointment. ""You've turned into a green-eyed monster. Rosemary was just trying to help you, and you went and pushed her away?""

Rosemary started tugging on his arm, stammering, ""Austin, I'm fine. It's my fault. I made Laurel mad.""

I finally managed to stand and let out a soft laugh. ""What a twist! Did I even touch you, Rosemary? No matter what happens, suddenly it's my fault? Am I like some kind of biochemical weapon just for you?""

Rosemary looked stunned, lost for words, but then tears started streaming down her face as if they were on a mission.

""Laurel, I want you to apologize to Rosemary! Or else I'm not getting married,"" Austin demanded, furrowing his brow. He seemed totally unfazed by the breakup talk.

Sure, I usually brought up breakups during our fights, but in the end, all it took was a little coaxing from him, and I'd be back on his side, pretending nothing had ever gone wrong.

I didn't want to dwell on these arguments to protect our feelings.

But suddenly it hit me: what Austin and I had was just me fooling myself, constantly backing down and giving in.

""Austin, we're done. I'm the one who called it off. You both handle it from here,"" I said, wanting nothing more than to walk away from the mess and that scum for good.

With that, I grabbed my suitcase and headed for the door, not looking back. Rosemary was still trying to reason with Austin. ""Austin, you should go after Laurel. This is all my fault,"" she pleaded.

""Relax, she's just having a little meltdown. She won't really break up with me,"" Austin assured her.

Once I settled into the cab, I noticed the two of them on the security camera, wrapped up in each other's arms, and I couldn't help but smirk a little. They claimed there was nothing between them, but deep down, I knew the truth.

I raised a hand to my cheek, still tender from Austin's earlier blow, and it felt like a knife twisted in my heart. The ache spread through my body, a reminder of the six years I'd wasted.

I wasn't crying, but my heart felt so heavy it was hard to breathe.

After a moment of reflection, I pulled up the video I had just recorded and posted it on my Instagram.

Since I decided to cut ties with Austin, I figured it was only fitting to finish what they started. I wasn't going to take this slap for nothing.

I crafted my last message: \[A shoutout to those who'd supported me over the past six years. I am officially breaking up with Austin.\]

With a final click, I powered off my phone. Clutching an ice pack over my throbbing head, I glanced at the city disappearing beneath me.

There was a mix of humiliation and anger in my heart, but seeing the bright blue sky somehow lightened the burden a bit.

Before I knew it, I drifted off to sleep, only to wake up with tears streaming down my face. Just then, a long, elegant hand offered me a gray handkerchief.

""Here,"" the owner of the pretty hand said, his voice smooth and calming.

""Thanks,"" I mumbled, taking it awkwardly.

""Are you alright?"" he asked, a note of concern in his tone.

I nodded, forcing a bittersweet smile. ""I'm fine, just a bad dream.""

I dreamt back to the first time I laid eyes on Austin, my heart racing—it was definitely one of those love-at-first-sight moments.

Later on, I even went so far as to lower my standards just to get into the same school as him. I thought it would lead to a better life, but honestly, I was just squandering my best years.

It was interesting how sometimes the wrong person could feel scarier than facing a real demon.

I let out a deep sigh and turned to glance at the guy sitting next to me. Just one look, and my whole body froze.

My heart raced as I managed to stammer, ""Un-uncle Alex, what are you doing here?""

Alex Herrera raised an eyebrow, sizing me up before casually saying, ""Didn't you break up with Austin? Why do you still call me uncle?""

# Chapter 5 An Awkward Encounter

I took a deep breath when I unexpectedly ran into Alex on the plane. How did I end up meeting him here? He was Austin's uncle and Raphael Herrera's youngest son.

In the Herrera family, he was the one everyone feared—especially Austin.

Growing up, Alex was molded to be someone else entirely. When I first heard his name, I pictured a woman, but instead, I found this incredibly handsome guy—more stunning than most women I know.

Not only did he have looks, but he had also got this air of sophistication about him. At a young age, he was already seated as the president of Herrera Group.

Though he was only six years older than Austin, Austin had to call him uncle, and I was dating Austin, so I'd been doing the same.

But now that Austin and I were officially done, it felt silly to still call him that.

""Did you and Austin have a fallout?"" Alex asked, his voice lowered as he crossed his legs, a knowing smile on his face.

""No, it's a breakup,"" I said, trying to sound confident.

""A breakup?"" He looked surprised, still smiling, but I could tell he didn't buy it.

I mean, who could blame him? Being married to Austin, a rich young man from the Herrera family, seemed like a dream for most women.

Besides, after six years together, how could I possibly just walk away from that? Back then, I was all-in on Austin.

Everyone thought I was just lucky to be with him, and honestly, if he'd revealed his true identity back in school, I might not have been his pick in the first place.

Now, I was nearing thirty with nothing to show for it—who was I to break up with him? Even Austin assumed I was head over heels for him and that suggesting a breakup was just me throwing a fit.

""Yeah,"" I said, taking a deep breath to steady myself, trying my best to keep it cool.

""I saw your Instagram."" Alex looked up slowly, his voice still calm and soft.

It felt like the way an elder talked to a younger person, but the light in his eyes—slightly reminiscent of Austin's—hit me with a mix of panic and awe.

I honestly hadn't expected Alex to keep tabs on my Instagram, and I'd even forgotten he had an account. He rarely said much online, just a few holiday photos now and then. I seriously wondered if he even used it himself.

""As long as you've thought it through,"" he added.

I was taken aback for a second, waiting for Alex to drop some words of shame or caution about being impulsive. Instead, he surprised me with his response.

The tension in my chest vanished instantly as I managed a shy smile and nodded silently.

I didn't breathe a sigh of relief until the plane touched down and I watched Alex stand up and grab his luggage.

Although he wasn't as intimidating as I had imagined, he still had this unshakeable aura that felt heavy.

As I stepped out of the airport, a black Alphard suddenly pulled up right in front of me.

Before I could process it, the driver came over and said, ""Ms. Parks, Mr. Herrera asked me to give you a ride.""

I opened my mouth to decline, but when the window rolled down and I saw that gorgeous face, words just vanished.

At that moment, it hit me—Austin's fear of Alex was totally justified. The guy had such a strong presence that I felt too timid to say no.

""Get in the car. It's going to rain soon,"" Alex said, glancing at me with that cool gaze.

I found myself sliding into the car without a second thought. Sitting beside him, I quickly masked my emotions. My face was calm, but inside, I felt this strange unease.

After all, I had just broken up with Austin. Why would Alex bother giving me a ride? Was it just because of the rain? Or maybe he felt sorry for me?

Trying to figure it out was a lost cause, especially since Alex and I had only crossed paths a few times.

It was not like a guy like him would focus on someone like me. Maybe it was just pity, some kindness for someone who had just got out of a serious relationship. Honestly, I decided not to overthink it.

""Where to?"" Alex's calm voice pulled me out of my thoughts.

""The hospital,"" I replied almost automatically, without thinking twice.

Honestly, I felt a bit awkward saying that, but I was already thankful that I kept my home address under wraps.

All of a sudden, it started pouring rain. It didn't even register with me that it was actually raining.

Half an hour later, we pulled up outside the hospital. The driver got out, grabbed my luggage from the trunk, and strolled over with an umbrella in hand.

As I stepped out, I glanced back at Alex, who was sitting in the car with his eyes half-closed. I swallowed my thanks and left.

Taking my suitcase and turning my back to the sleek black car, I finally let out a long sigh of relief.

In my mind, I couldn't shake the image of Alex's striking profile. He was clearly in his early thirties but carried an air of maturity that made him seem older.

It was a shame, too, because, with a face like that, Alex would probably attract a lot of young admirers.

As I walked into the hospital and fished out my phone, a call came in from an unknown number. After a brief moment of hesitation, I hit the answer button.

""Laurel, what the heck is wrong with you? Do you even realize that Rosemary is sick because of you?"" It was Amanda Herrera, Austin's mother, and her angry voice echoed through the line.

I stood there for a second, stunned, gripping my suitcase tightly.

""Laurel, you need to come back right now and apologize to Rosemary. Clear things up online and say you posted that video by accident. We'll let this slide!"" Amanda demanded.

I instinctively ran my fingers over my throat, which still felt a bit sore.

I was relieved that I hadn't gone through with getting a license with Austin.

Honestly, I was grateful for the last three years of not marrying him. It took me a while to truly see how ridiculous I was being.

Looking back on the past six years, it felt like I'd thrown a piece of my heart to the wolves.

I looked at her and said, ""Mrs. Herrera, Austin and I are through. So, do me a favor and don't bother me again.""

""Laurel, enough already! You're really crossing the line here. My mom called you—so what the hell do you want from me?"" Austin's voice came through, sharp and frustrated.

# Chapter 6 Back Home

The loud screech from the phone cut me off just as I was about to finish my sentence, thanks to Austin.

I couldn't help but smile a little as I said, ""Austin, your mom has always looked down on me, thinking I'm not good enough for you.

""Now that we've broken up, you can finally be with Rosemary, and I want to wish you both a happy marriage. Don't ever call me again.""

With that, I hung up the phone. Amanda had never been a fan because she thought my family was too ordinary and my mom's situation was a burden.

I was just a good-for-nothing in her eyes, but she reluctantly went along with the marriage because I was so focused on Austin.

Still, she always found ways to undermine and belittle me in front of Austin.

I tried to keep my cool because I didn't want to cause drama with her since she was his mom, and it was supposed to be about me and Austin in the future.

Little did I realize, I was just an easy target for their manipulation.

Rosemary also joined in, spreading lies about me. It felt like they thought I was overreacting just because she was sick and I had to cater to her every whim.

Whenever I liked something, I'd end up giving it to her without a second thought. At first, it was just jewelry, clothes, and bags—things that didn't mean much to me, even if I had spent a lot of money on them.",1,1749811363.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

Several months ago a conversation was being had about rap lyrics at my workplace. Though I am light complexion my mother is half black and everyone at work knows that. The N Word came into conversation and I said “I don’t like that word. I wish everyone would stop using it because of how rooted in hate it is” IMMEDIATELY after my ignorant coworker said “I call my boyfriend my n***a all the time” and began laughing. I did not even know how to react. My manger was present so I think I was expecting her to reprimand in private. (<<remember this part)

This happened in January 2025, and it has always at odd with me. I recently visited my mom and let her know it had been plaguing me. She told me to speak up.

It’s June now and I finally did speak up. My manager made excuses instead after excuse for this coworker who is 40 years old and has been living in Detroit for years now. She is a European, but apparently college educated adult who has been living in a black capital city for 2+ years. But my manager excused her by saying she is an immigrant from another country. I said she should know better and aside from knowing better I explicitly said “I don’t like that word no one should use it..” and within seconds the coworker made that comment. Now here is the thing, MY MANAGER WAS THERE WHEN THE COMMENT WAS MADE. Either she is pretending she doesn’t remember or it was so common to her that it wasn’t insignificant enough for her to remember. Both of which are an issue.

This coworker is a personal friend of another attorney at our workplace and she seems to be highly favored. She always does personal things on the job while myself and another coworker work diligently.

I let my manager know my sentiments on this and was met with more excuses and to not assume the tasks of this coworker. Even though this coworker is always taking coffee and smoke breaks and making personal calls on the job and leaving early (hmm if she was doing as much as the rest of us I highly doubt all these other things could be done, right)

It was an hour long conversation of excuse after excuse and I ultimately didn’t tell her what this coworker also did some months ago that triggered me to my core. My coworkers all know I was unfortunately sexually assaulted as a child. One day the coworker asked me to hook her bra strap because it had unfastened. When this happens to me is usually just go into the bathroom and fasten it myself but to each their own..I did it the first time… It occurred a second time a few days later and this time when the coworker lifted her shirt she, for whatever reason pulled down have of her pants exposing the top portion of her butt. I was confused but didn’t know what to do? I will be taking this up with HR because I don’t think I’d get anywhere with my manager…

Thoughts on all of this would be appreciated


And yes I did tell my manager I wanted to put in my two weeks notice at the end of the useless conversation. She said to think about it and get back to her on Monday. I’m firm on leaving for my own sanity, but should I tell HR before I leave or is that fruitless as well?

I left the house. Mistake number one.

“I’ve got this.” I said but I was done.

The sun was loud. The people worse.

My brain rehearsed that awkward curse.

\-------------------------------------

A stranger smiled. My soul collapsed.

A weird nod. My voice just snapped.

“Great weather!” they said. “Thanks, you too.”

Then regretted it instantly. Classic you.

\-------------------------------------

In line for coffee, I stood so tense. ‍

Practiced my order like a defense.

Said it too fast... then said it once more.

Now my dignity’s spilled across the floor.

\-------------------------------------

I tripped on air... then apologized.

To the air. I was a little... surprised.

Someone saw. I met their glare.

Internally screamed... then external stare.

\-------------------------------------

The noise, the lights, the endless chat.

My social battery died just like that.

I tried to leave with some finesse.

But I made eye contact. Now I’m stressed.

\-------------------------------------

So if you see me out, but standing still,

I’ll be fighting a silent battle uphill.

I’m not being rude. I’m just buffering slow.

Spiralling softly... just thought you should know.

And in that library, you save the ones that truly meant something to you. The ones you’ll pass down someday— with coffee stains, scribbles and all lol.

“The Little Prince” by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry is one of those books.

It took me back to how life felt as a kid—when the world was huge and full of wonder, and everything made sense in its own magical way.
It’s technically a children’s book, but it hits deep—talking about love, loss, greed, addiction, sacrifice, and what it means to really care for something (or someone).

It ends with the Little Prince disappearing into the stars—eerily mirroring Saint-Exupéry’s own real-life disappearance.
And just like that, you’re left with questions. Wonder. And hope. ✨

Now I’m tucking this one away—for a tiny human with wide little eyes, brimming with curiosity, to pick up later. 🌌📖

Chapter 1  
  
The wedding reached the ring exchange part, the screen suddenly displayed a high-definition video of me being kidnapped, beaten, and sexually violated.  
  
My fiancé,Kieran Stark called off the wedding on the spot,immediately slipped the ring onto my best friend Athena's finger instead.  
  
I fell from the red carpet amid the friends' curses and humiliation.  
  
One of Athena's mafia boss friend,Declan Royce,caught me, had his security team silence the entire room with his command, and even bring in ten cases of cash, proposing to me in front of everyone.  
  
Moved by his action, I said yes.  
  
Three years later, the IVF finally succeeded. I was rushing to share the wonderful news with him when I overheard his conversation with his friends.  
  
""Hey,bro, you're fucking brilliant!Releasing that video of Talia being kidnapped and sexually assaulted at the wedding was the only way Miss Athena could marry into the Stark family.""  
  
Declan spun his lighter and said, ""A prestigious family like the Starks would never marry a woman who's been... used. Only after Talia was completely ruined could Athena rightfully become Mrs. Stark.""  
  
His friend asked, confused, ""But Miss Athena has already married into the Stark family. Why the hell did you bother marrying this... slut woman?""  
  
""Athena's afraid of pain. Perfect to use Talia's womb to give her a child. Once she delivers the Stark heir, Athena's position in the family will be solid.""  
  
The waves of laughter from the private room made my blood run cold.  
  
All those moments I thought were happiness—they were just part of Declan's elaborate con to squeeze every last drop of value from me.  
  
All so Athena could climb to the top by stepping on my body.  
  
Wiping away my tears, I dialed his rival's number""I've got a ten-billion-dollar deal. You interested?""  
  
The mocking voices in the room continued.  
  
""Damn, Declan, you're a genius. Switching that woman's vitamins with abortion pills—when she couldn't conceive naturally, she had to do IVF. If she knew that you'd already swapped out the embryo with Miss Athena and Kieran's kid... oh, she'd probably fuming.""  
  
""What’s it to me? After she gives birth, I'll just make up some excuse about the baby dying. She'll think it's her own fault for not being able to keep the child. Being able to pave the way for Athena's happiness... that's her honor.""  
  
Throwing his lighter onto the table, he stood up and warned everyone present, ""Not a single word of today's conversation leaves this room. I need her to deliver this baby without any trouble.""  
  
Milo slapped his chest, laughing, ""Boss, don't worry. That woman's dumb as shit. We call her 'sister-in-law' and she actually thinks she's the lady of the house. Every day she brings us food and drinks... she has no clue that I personally handpicked every single guy who was in that video.""  
  
Someone burst out laughing, ""Milo, you're such a bastard!Why didn't you pick me back then? I would've loved to have a taste of—""  
  
A fruit knife suddenly flew across the room, embedding itself in the floor right between the man's legs.  
  
The joker's face went pale with terror.  
  
""Did I or did I not say that Talia is my fucking wife now? Anyone who dares bring up that shit again, I'll fucking kill them.""  
  
One of his men sheepishly said, ""Boss, seems like you actually do care about her a bit. And that woman loves you so much... aren't you worried that someday she'll find out the truth and leave you?""  
  
Declan scoffed dismissively, ""Worst case scenario, I'll just get her pregnant with another test tube baby and keep her for the rest life. She's just a foolish woman—give her a few sweet words and she'll come crawling back like a fucking dog.""  
  
The private room erupted in laughter again. I stood at the door, feeling like I'd been struck by lightning.  
  
I could only cover my mouth tightly.  
  
Footsteps approached the door. I quickly turned and ran downstairs, poured myself a glass of wine, and downed it in one gulp.  
  
The burning sensation shot straight to my head, and tears finally broke free.  
  
I clutched my chest as those soul-crushing words echoed over and over in my mind.  
  
A week before the wedding, I was suddenly kidnapped and endured a day and night that even like hell.  
  
My fiancé Kieran held my hand tenderly, saying he loved me and still wanted to marry me.  
  
But the wedding I'd been so excited for turned into a nightmare when that video of my assault played for everyone to see.  
  
Kieran's abandonment turned me into a whore scorned by thousands.  
  
It was Declan who burst in, smashed the giant screen, held me in his arms, and viciously drove back everyone's shame and curses.  
  
He had people bring in ten cases of cash for me, saying he'd fallen in love with me long ago, and if he couldn't marry me in this lifetime, he'd never release.  
  
It was his determined gaze that conquered me. Now he was telling me that everything he did was just to pave the way for Athena.  
  
No wonder Athena looked at me with that strange smile on the wedding day.  
  
I was kidnapped because Athena said her car broke down and asked me to pick her up.  
  
She knew all along that all this was just a scheme Declan had set up for her.  
  
She was laughing at my stupidity, even more pleased to have such a devoted backup ready to do anything for her.  
  
And these three years of care and affection were just fake emotions Declan put on to squeeze every last drop of value from me.  
  
Yet I mistook the damn demon for my savior. How fucking ridiculous!  
  
My fingernails dug into my flesh as I gritted my teeth. Pain and hatred churned in my chest, and the tears just wouldn't stop.  
  
A familiar scent drifted down from above.  
  
Declan tenderly kissed the corners of my eyes, but his brow furrowed deeply as he cursed loudly for everyone to hear, ""Which bastard made my wife cry? I'll fucking kill him!""  
  
The entire hall fell silent. Everyone was too terrified to even breathe.  
  
Declan pulled out his gun and pressed it into my hands, wrapping his arms around me and guiding my grip as he swept it across everyone present, ""Baby, see anyone you don't like? Just shoot them. I'm got your back.""  
  
Everyone he aimed at shook like leaves, but none dared to dodge.  
  
In LA, Declan was the boss of one of the two biggest families. No one could afford to cross him.  
  
When the gun stopped on Milo, I paused.  
  
Milo's eyes went wide, his face white with terror.  
  
That phrase 'I personally handpicked every single guy who was in that video' kept screaming in my ears like a curse.  
  
My chest heaved violently. Just as I was about to pull the trigger with red eyes, the gun barrel was pushed down.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
""Honey, the doctor said your IVF was successful. Better not see blood right now—wouldn't want to scare the baby.""  
  
He coaxed me gently, the concern in his eyes looking completely genuine.I almost couldn't help but applaud his fucking Oscar-worthy performance.  
  
Noticing something was off with my mood, Declan spotted the drink glass in front of me and asked, squeezing my palm, ""Babe, how long have you been here? Why didn't you come upstairs to find me?""  
  
There was careful probing hidden in his words.  
  
I looked down and said flatly, ""You guys were talking business upstairs—with cigar and wine. I don't like that.""  
  
He sighed in relief and patted my head, having a maid bring over some coffee.  
  
Just as the maid handed over the coffee, he suddenly grabbed his gun and shoot at her head.  
  
I didn't even have time to react. Thick blood splattered across my face as the maid's outstretched hand froze mid-gesture before she collapsed, eyes wide with shock.  
  
My lips trembled as my stomach clenched uncontrollably.  
  
Declan acted like nothing happened, setting down the gun and carefully wiping my face clean with his sleeve before feeding me the sobering coffee sip by sip.  
  
I swallowed mechanically, my whole body shaking.  
  
In my peripheral vision, Milo had someone drag the maid's body away.  
  
A winding trail of blood stretched across the floor.  
  
""Can't even take care of my wife properly—letting her drink is harming my son. No reason for her to keep breathing.""  
  
I looked at his cold, vicious expression as my stomach churned violently.  
  
Declan tenderly touched my face, ""It's all my fault for making you suffer so much. Now that we finally have a baby, no more alcohol, okay?""  
  
""This child has to be born healthy no matter what, understand?""  
  
I took several deep breaths before forcing out a dry smile, ""Okay.""  
  
But my heart felt frozen with fear.  
  
In three years of marriage, I'd been pregnant six times. Each time, I miscarried for no apparent reason.  
  
After so many losses, it became habitual miscarriage.  
  
Six months ago, the doctor declared I could never conceive again.  
  
Declan held me lovingly, saying he didn't care about children—as long as I was happy and healthy.  
  
I'd been tormented by guilt over not being able to give him a healthy child. After extensive research, I chose the difficult path of IVF.  
  
My belly was riddled with needle holes, hormone pills taken by the handful.  
  
All that suffering, and it was all just to benefit Athena.  
  
Just because she was afraid of pain, I had to permanently lose my chance at motherhood and become nothing but a breeding machine.  
  
""What's wrong? You look terrible. Are you feeling sick? I'll get a doctor here right away.""  
  
""I'm fine, just a bit of morning sickness.""  
  
Declan's eyes reddened with concern as he gently caressed my face, ""Honey, you're so tired. I wish I could bear this for you. We rushed into marriage back then—I've ordered your favorite imported wedding dress. Before you start showing, let's go try it on tomorrow.""  
  
I stared at him steadily. Such loving eyes, treating me like a fool, lying to me again and again.  
  
If he knew I had no intention of carrying this baby to term, I'd probably end up just like that maid.  
  
I forced a smile, ""I'm going to rest. You guys keep talking.""  
  
As soon as I got back to the room, I couldn't help but rush to the bathroom and vomit until my stomach twisted into knots.  
  
Tears streamed down my face. The physical pain was nothing compared to even a fraction of the heartbreak.  
  
After recovering for a while, I finally got up and came out, only to see Declan's phone left on the sofa.  
  
As if possessed, I picked it up and tried Athena's birthday as the passcode. It unlocked on the first try.  
  
The wallpaper was a photo of Athena leaning against his shoulder with a radiant smile.  
  
I scrolled through the photo album.  
  
Over five thousand photos, every single one featuring Athena.  
  
He'd used four folders to save them, documenting different periods of Athena's life. Each word was labeled with just one character that together spelled out ""love.""  
  
In their chat history, Declan had once risked his life to steal a queen's crown from Country A overnight.  
  
I suddenly remembered that day—he came back with two bullet wounds, nearly didn't make it. I had to trade my mother's only keepsake, a priceless diamond, to get him back from the royal family.  
  
All because Athena mentioned wanting to feel like a queen at her 25th birthday party.  
  
Tears fell onto the screen as my heart felt like it was being carved up.  
  
Not from the pain of years of deception, but because for such a demon who destroyed me, I'd even sacrificed the only item my mother left me.  
  
Through blurred vision, my eyes fell on the crescent-shaped birthmark on Athena's right shoulder, and I gasped in shock.  
  
I had an identical birthmark in the exact same spot on my right shoulder.  
  
I remembered when I first met Athena, she didn't have this birthmark.  
  
Ever since I told her about saving a blood-covered man when I worked as a Doctors Without Borders volunteer in Tilan Country, she started distancing herself from me.  
  
Not long after, she became Declan's sister, and Declan had also said that Athena had saved his life.  
  
But Athena was a coward who feared death. Tilan Country, a war-torn nation—she'd never even been there, always bad-mouthing and looking down on it.  
  
My fingers curled coldly as an absurd suspicion gradually took shape in my mind.  
  
So that's how it is!  
  
I collapsed to the floor, crying and laughing at the same time.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
After a long while, I wiped away my tears, composed myself, and find an unfamiliar phone number.  
  
""I've got a ten-billion-dollar deal. You interested?""  
  
""What kind of business?""  
  
""Kidnap me in three days.""  
  
I gently touched my belly, ""Declan will pay this ransom willingly.""  
  
Just as I hung up, Declan pushed the door open.  
  
He'd been drinking heavily, stumbling slightly as he walked, but his vigilance was sharp as ever as he grabbed my hand, ""What am I supposedly paying for willingly?""  
  
I answered without blinking, ""I saw a beactiful necklace. They said I need to pay for first.""  
  
He smiled and rested his head on my shoulder, ""Fine, I'll pay, I'll pay for everything. Athena, whatever you want, I will give you. I'm yours too.""  
  
I kept my expression blank as I helped him to bed and tucked him in, then lay beside him with my eyes open all night.  
  
The next day, halfway to the bridal shop, Declan took a call and frantically explained to me, ""Honey,I need to go handle some toubles right now.""  
  
He gripped my hand apologetically, ""I'm sorry. Tomorrow I'll definitely come with you to try on the dress. I even ordered matching a rare rings—let's go try them together tomorrow, okay?""  
  
I pulled my hand away, ""I understand. Go handle your business. I'll be good and wait for you at home.""  
  
He squeezed my hand, and as soon as I got out of the car, he sped away.  
  
Less than ten minutes later, Milo's car arrived.  
  
As soon as I got in, a photo of Athena came through.  
  
She wore a dazzling diamond ring and the imported wedding dress I'd chosen, kneeling on a man's lap.  
  
A large hand rested on her pale thigh through the sheer fabric, lips kissing the crescent birthmark on her right shoulder, eyes dark with desire.  
  
A message followed immediately.  
  
""I can only make love with her at night with the lights off, imagining she's you.Athena, my sweet baby, your brother misses you so much. Make your brother feel good.""  
  
The hoarse voice was followed by suppressed panting.  
  
In the silent car, Milo's mocking laughter rang out.  
  
I was shocked, suddenly realizing we weren't heading home.  
  
""Milo, I'm Mrs.Royce! What the hell do you think you're doing?""  
  
The car stopped abruptly. I immediately reached for the other door, but he was faster, grabbing my ankle and dragging me out of the car.  
  
The pain made everything go black.  
  
I glared at him through gritted teeth, ""I'm carrying Declan's baby. If anything happens to me, you won't survive either.""  
  
""You stupid bitch, you don't really think Declan would let a dirty whore like you carry his child, do you?""  
  
A shrill laugh came from behind me. Only then did I notice this street wasn't far from the bridal shop.  
  
Athena stepped on my face, her eyes and expression full of gleeful satisfaction.  
  
Milo walked over and wrapped his arms around her waist, groping her roughly. Under my shocked gaze, the two kissed passionately!  
  
After a while, Milo spoke leisurely, ""You heard us at the door that day, didn't you? Too bad the embryo in your belly isn't Athena's either. I just grabbed some random bastard's spawn from the slums and swapped it out.""  
  
I jerked my head up, pupils trembling with shock.  
  
Athena laughed until she shook.  
  
""Oh gosh, now you're dirty bitch inside and out! A bastard's baby, a whore mother.  
  
Talia, what's the difference between you and a club hooker? At least they get paid a few bucks. You're not getting money to birth a bastard!""  
  
""Is one enough? Should we stuff your belly more?""  
  
My head was spinning, thick sweetness rushing to my throat.  
  
I roared and grabbed a stone from the ground, wanting nothing more than to take these two down with me.  
  
Milo kicked me in the stomach. I fell face-first, spitting up blood, my face pale with agony.  
  
But just then, Athena suddenly stepped back in apparent terror, swaying before falling backward.  
  
Even though she hadn't been hurt, Declan came running and stepped on my hand as he rushed to hold her, his eyes full of naked concern, ""Athena, how are you? Are you injuried?""
