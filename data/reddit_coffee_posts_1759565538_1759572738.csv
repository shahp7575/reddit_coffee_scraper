1nxpxh0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1nxpxh0/how_to_find_peace_in_a_new_country/,How to find peace in a new country,"I (F25) moved to Italy to study for a Master’s degree (in English), but I recently found out that due to some issues on my end I won’t be getting the scholarship I depended on. If you’re wondering why I came without scholarship confirmation, they announce the scholarship results after classes begin and I had planned to just go back home if it didn’t go through. 

Now that I know I’ve no scholarship, I just want to go back home immediately. It’s been 2 weeks here and I have not enjoyed one moment. I know it’s the shock of being in a new country but I had been dreaming of this my whole life and yet I feel so ungrateful for not wanting to spend even a moment here anymore. I’ve already tried the food, gelato, coffee, traveled to a few other cities, even made friends. But I just don’t like it here. 

The question: I have enough funds to sustain me a few more months and I wanted to use them to explore the country or just live my life. Yet, I’m so depressed getting out of bed in the morning is super hard and I’m either anxious or depressed all the time. How do I tackle this?

Going home so early would mean questions from everyone about why I just spent a few weeks and came back etc. I feel stuck and heavily depressed (I have a diagnosed depression problem). What do I do?

Also, I’ve looked up every way to fund myself here and there’s no way I can afford more than a few months, so I’m definitely going to have to leave.

Have my
Tricuspid valve replaced. 9/16/25 had permanent pacemaker put in. 9/17/25 discharged from hospital. 
                9/29/25 noticed swelling in feet and ankles,
Lower legs, experiencing extreme shortness of breath. Went back to
The hospital. They admitted me, gave me lasix through my IV. Did bloodwork, ct scan, EKG, and X-ray’s. 9/30 got an echocardiogram done. They discharged me on oxygen 24/7, on 4 liters per minute. S/N this oxygen machine is HUGE compared to the machine I had when I was only on 2 liters! 
                Yesterday morning, I went to see my lung doctor, she ask’s me if I’m still taking blood thinners. I say no. I haven’t been on blood thinners in a very long time. My doctor told me to stop taking them several months ago. ( my valve replacement is tissue valve, not mechanical). She looks at me with this very concerned look, and says that I should be taking them, and that my most recent echo, from a few days ago, showed I have a blood clot and signs of infection. Like what??? No one ever told me that! ALTHOUGH……. The hospital was in a RUSH to discharge me immediately after wheeling me back upstairs from my echo. So I guess they didn’t even get my results yet! So at 7 or 8 when my doctors office opens, I will be calling cardiology and asking them about this. It’s always something …. 
              I am feeling slightly better…. Not completely. I can tell I still have fluid in my lungs because I am still experiencing shortness of breath any time I take my oxygen off. I am not lugging this big machine around with me to do errands such as go to my regular scheduled doctors appointments, or to go get my morning coffee. So I struggle walking to my truck, sit in my truck for a few mins to catch my breath, then proceed. Hopefully being in the lasix a few more days will get all the liquid out of me.

I would write long lists of everything “wrong” with me and then try to fix it all at once. It always ended the same way, I’d burn out, feel like a failure, and start the cycle again.

Then one day I asked myself, what if nothing’s actually wrong with me? What if I just don’t have a life that supports me?

So instead of chasing massive change, I started adding small things that made me feel more like myself, morning walks without my phone, actually finishing my coffee without rushing, journaling before doomscrolling, dressing up even when I had nowhere to go. It wasn’t aesthetic. It was grounding.

And slowly, I stopped trying to become a better version of myself and started enjoying who I already was.
My anxiety got quieter, my confidence felt more stable, and I didn’t feel like I was constantly chasing “progress.”

1nxpui7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1nxpui7/does_desenruis_zr001_water_filter_truly_deliver/,Does DESENRUIS ZR-001 Water Filter Truly Deliver Superior Filtration Quality Review?,"Testing the DESENRUIS DESENRUIS-ZR-001 water filter replacement over the last few weeks gave me a good sense of what to expect from this multi-stage filtration system. I’ve been using it in my kitchen water pitcher, putting its capacity to reduce lead, chromium, and PFOA/PFOS to the test. While the product proves effective in many areas, there are a few noteworthy aspects to weigh before committing to it.

**Quick and Versatile Compatibility**  
One of the main reasons I picked up this filtration system was its compatibility. Designed for various pitcher and dispenser models—including ZR-001, ZR-017, ZR-004, ZP-006, ZD-013, and ZS-008—it slid easily into my water pitcher without any adjustments. I didn’t have to fidget with it, which was a pleasant surprise. Having struggled with mismatched filters before, this one was a breeze. Its fit felt secure, and there were no signs of leakage in my tests.

[Check DESENRUIS DESENRUIS-ZR-001 price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b0cqjs7bnm/)

**Effective Multi-Stage Filtration System**  
The five-stage filtration system goes above and beyond the basics, managing to remove dissolved solids, improve water taste, and reduce nasty contaminants like lead and chromium. I’ve always been skeptical about whether some filters genuinely enhance taste, but this one delivered. My morning coffee tasted notably cleaner and more vibrant, and gone was the faint metallic tang that our tap water often carried. On hot days, I even found myself opting for a glass of plain water—something I rarely do. It’s clear this filtration system enhances both taste and safety.

**Fast Filtration Speed**  
Time is a luxury for anyone with a packed schedule, and waiting ages for water to filter can get frustrating. This filter processes a gallon of water in roughly ten minutes, which stands out compared to slower models. It’s practical, especially when hosting gatherings where multiple refills are necessary. However, I did notice a slight dip in speed nearing the end of its lifespan, but it’s nothing too drastic.

**Durability and Longevity**  
Each filter can process about 60 liters of water under standard conditions. While this isn’t necessarily groundbreaking, it’s sufficient for my household’s typical water consumption. What’s particularly commendable is the environmental aspect: by replacing up to 160 plastic bottles, this product promotes sustainability, which I always appreciate. A definite plus for eco-conscious buyers.

**Key Benefits**  
- Effortless compatibility with a wide range of water pitchers and dispensers.  
- Five-layer filtration ensures clean and great-tasting water.  
- Improves environmental sustainability by reducing single-use plastic consumption.  

**Pitfalls**  
- Filtration speed dips slightly as the filter nears the end of its lifecycle.  
- Longevity (60 liters per filter) might not suffice for high-consumption households.  

**Material and Build Quality**  
Constructed from carbon fiber and food-grade materials, this filter feels reassuringly high-quality. I’ve come across flimsy filters before where parts chipped or warped with prolonged exposure to water, but this one held up remarkably well. The increased activated carbon content—30% more than many competitors—is noticeable even in performance. There was a fresher taste to the water, and it’s clear this filter pulls its weight.

**Competing Products**  
When pitted against other popular water filters, such as Brita or PUR models, the DESENRUIS version holds its ground well. Brita filters, for example, are known for their taste improvement but often lack the same speed and comprehensive chemical reduction that DESENRUIS offers. Meanwhile, PUR filters shine in removing impurities, particularly chlorine, but tend to clog easier. Comparing these, DESENRUIS strikes a good balance of speed, compatibility, and performance, though some competitors may offer slightly longer lifespans. This filter system is an excellent choice for anyone seeking versatility and quick filtration.

**Cost Efficiency**  
From a budget-friendly perspective, the filter delivers solid performance without breaking the bank. Its overall capabilities align with the price, and you won’t feel shortchanged by what you’re getting. Other brands may offer cheaper systems, but they compromise on filtration performance or compatibility. Investing in this system means you’re paying for what matters: cleaner, safer water with minimal effort.

Hello everyone 
Hope you’re doing well and feeling refreshed. 
I will be honest. Feeling a bit lonely and I fancy a chat in the hope to make a connection or just have a conversation 

I work in an office. So it’s pretty much the same thing everyday. You know how it is. 
I think I need a new job. Like a lion tamer or a skydiver 

Anyway 
Like I said I work in a office but I do train strength sports and some times I compete 
Food is a big thing in my life. 
If you can cook. Im putty in your hands. 
If you can’t well I guess we can just order. 

I love a bit of a laugh some banter. In a cheeky way. 
I’m currently off for the weekend and doing some bits and bobs. 
But I’m fully available to chat.and see where it goes. 

So please introduce yourself.

In return, he finally gave me a promise: ""Do this last thing, and we'll get married.""The ninety-ninth thing was to pick him up from the airport.That day, the rain was coming down in sheets. I waited in the terminal all night, clutching a bouquet of his favorite white roses.At dawn, a security guard found me passed out in the waiting area. When they took me to the hospital, my fever was 103.The first thing I saw when I woke up was a picture on my social media feed. It was his wedding photo, with his secretary, Hailey.In the picture, his arm was around her waist. The caption read: Finally found a wife my mom approves of.I ordered ninety-nine white chrysanthemums from a flower shop and had them sent to his office.I included a card: Congratulations on the wedding. May you have a hell of a life.He cornered me in the lobby of my office building, furious. “Hailey’s dad has terminal liver cancer. His last wish was to see his daughter get married. Can’t you have a little compassion?”I answered slowly, deliberately. “Then I wish your father-in-law a long and healthy life, and may your marriage be an ironclad prison, so the old man doesn’t get any more shocks to his system.”As I locked my car doors, I could vaguely hear him shouting, “Do you have to be so vicious?”I rolled down the window, gave him the middle finger, and smiled. “Compared to you two, I’m not even close.”...When I left the hospital and saw Adrian back at the office, I turned to walk away, but he grabbed my wrist.“Chloe, do you really have to make this so ugly?”His voice was tight with anger. “As soon as her dad’s condition stabilizes, I’ll file for divorce. I promise.”I looked at the diamond ring on his finger and wanted to laugh.Seven years. He always had a new reason, a new condition.“Adrian, do you have any idea how long I waited for you at Terminal 3?”I took off my sunglasses so he could see the bloodshot veins in my eyes. “From the first flight delay until the last train of the night stopped running. The arrivals screen was just a blank slate.”Just like my life had been, from college to the corporate world, helping him build his company from nothing.The first time, he said if I turned down my study abroad offer, we would get married.The second time, he said once the company got through its financial crisis, we would get the license.The fiftieth time, he said after Hailey’s father’s surgery, we would plan the wedding.The seventy-eighth time, he said if I could help Hailey land that major client, he would take me to pick out a ring....The ninety-eighth time, he said once the company’s valuation hit a hundred million, he would make our relationship public.The ninety-ninth time, he said it was a perfect, auspicious number. He said if I picked him up from the airport in one week, he would go with me to city hall and finally give me a home.For that promise, I took his meeting minutes, I schmoozed his clients until the early hours of the morning, I even took care of his sick mother while he was on business trips.The day he was supposed to come back, I waited at the airport from morning until night. My heels had rubbed my feet raw, but I stubbornly refused to sit down.I was terrified I would miss the first glimpse of him walking out.At midnight, all flights were grounded. The airport was shutting down.The floor-to-ceiling windows reflected my disheveled hair. The few remaining travelers stared at my smeared makeup.The ground staff kept asking if I needed help.I just shook my head.“Ma’am, the last international flight landed four hours ago,” a young woman at the check-in counter gently reminded me.My temperature was rising in the cold, air-conditioned terminal. My vision started to blur.But I couldn’t leave. What if he came out and didn’t see me? What if this was the final test?At dawn, a cleaning lady pushed her mop past me. “Honey, you should go home. There was a gentleman with a lady friend last night. They left through the VIP exit.”It was like I was waking up from a trance. I stiffly lowered my head and opened my phone.The first post on my feed was from him, two hours ago. The caption read: So touched by the thoughtful care I received on my trip abroad.In that moment, I finally understood: someone who truly loves you would never make you wait in a storm for a flight that was never going to arrive.“Chloe!” He was banging on my car window. “Can’t you be more understanding? Is a marriage certificate really that important?”His angry voice shattered my memories.“Yes, it is. For example, right now, I’m so incredibly grateful that the person in that wedding photo isn’t me.”He tried to say something else, but I had already started the car and shot off like an arrow.Back at my apartment, I curled up on the balcony and drank half a bottle of whiskey. My phone buzzed.Adrian had updated his social media. A nine-photo grid of his and Hailey’s wedding pictures.In a drunken haze, I decided to delete our photos together.But when I opened my gallery, all I could find were the business proposals he had me revise, the contracts he had me sign, the meeting minutes he had me organize.In seven years, we didn’t have a single photo together worth deleting.My phone screen lit up. Adrian’s name.10 o’clock. The usual spot. Pick me up.Chapter 2My body reacted before my brain. I pushed myself up from the vanity, but a wave of dizziness sent me crashing back into the chair.I stumbled for my car keys, but a second message came through:Playing dead again?My stomach churned. I ran to the bathroom and was violently ill.The cold tile against my cheek shocked me into clarity.We ended yesterday.The tears started to fall. I buried my face in my knees and sobbed.Adrian’s third message was laced with fury: ??? Are you f—king done with this or not?Yes, Adrian, I am. We’re over.After sending the message, I blocked the number I knew by heart.I forced myself up, took a quick shower, got dressed, and went to the convenience store downstairs. I bought a slice of strawberry shortcake.He always said he hated sweets, so I had given them up for seven years.But last week, I had seen Hailey eating macarons in his office, and the way he smiled at her was so indulgent.As the cream melted on my tongue, I laughed through my tears.When a man doesn't love you, even your taste buds are wrong.Hailey’s social media updated. A close-up shot of two hands, intertwined.None of our mutual friends had liked it. I knew it was posted just for me to see.I threw the sickly sweet cake in the trash, went home, and passed out on the couch.At 4 a.m., Adrian, smelling of alcohol, let himself in with the key I had given him and threw his suit jacket at me.“Chloe, you’ve got some nerve. Not answering my calls?”The stench of cheap perfume and stale alcohol hit me like a wave, making me gag.Adrian’s eyes narrowed, fixed on my expression. “Stomach bug? Or are you pregnant?”I slowly sat up. “I got my period last week.”“I’m just a little nauseated by the smell of your secretary’s perfume on you.”Adrian flinched. “Chloe, don't start with the veiled accusations.”“I’m working my ass off every day. What do you do besides being paranoid?”“Working?” I rubbed my temples. “Working on teaching Hailey how to read contracts at the hotel? Getting her perfume all over you in the process? Adrian, do you think I’m stupid?”He adjusted his cufflinks. “We have a professional relationship! Can you stop being so sensitive?”I watched the familiar motion of his hands and laughed.After all these years, his tell when he was lying hadn't changed.“Does a professional relationship require unbuttoning your shirt?”I took a sip of water. “Adrian, does lying to me give you a sense of accomplishment?”“Chloe, you’re being completely unreasonable!”He spun around, his tie flying out in a pathetic arc.“And even if I am closer to her, you’re the one who pushed me away.”He loosened his tie, his voice rising. “Seven years, Chloe. Can’t you think about anything other than marriage?”See? In his eyes, it was always my fault.“Leave the key on the coffee table. You should go home.”I walked barefoot to the bedroom, the sound of the front door slamming shut behind me.I finally understood. With some people, even trying to communicate is a waste of life.The next day, as I was packing my things at the office, Hailey clip-clopped over to my desk.“Chloe, look what I have here.” She waved a small, red booklet in my face—their marriage certificate.I wasn’t in the mood for her games. I tried to walk past her, but she grabbed my purse strap.I instinctively pushed her away. She shrieked and fell to the floor.“Chloe! What are you doing?!” Adrian burst out of his office.Hailey’s eyes immediately filled with tears. “Adrian, I was just trying to talk to her.”“Chloe, apologize to Hailey.” Adrian grabbed my wrist. “Don’t make me say it again.”I wrenched my arm away and sneered. “Impressive. You’ve really mastered the art of playing the victim.”Smack!Before I could finish, Adrian’s hand connected with my cheek. My ears rang.“You disgust me,” he spat, his voice filled with rage. “Pack your things and get the hell out.”I touched my stinging cheek and wanted to laugh.Disgusting? Who was the disgusting one?I used to not be able to fall asleep unless his palm was resting on my cheek. Now, he could slap me without a second thought.I threw my ID badge on the floor. “I should have left this garbage dump a long time ago.”Chapter 3On the morning of the third day, I packed the last of my things.For Adrian, I had followed him from a skyscraper in downtown Manhattan to this third-tier city. I had even missed my parents’ sixtieth birthday.When I went to the office to finalize my resignation, my colleagues were surprised to see me.The new intern looked at me strangely. “Chloe, didn’t you know? Mr. Hayes and Hailey are getting married today, at Rose Park.”The resignation form in my hand crumpled.As I was driving past Rose Park, I slammed on the brakes.Seven years ago, we used to come here to feed the pigeons.We had just graduated, crammed into a tiny studio apartment. Adrian always said that when we had money, he would have our wedding here.I remember one time, it was snowing, and he pointed to the frozen lake.“Chloe, what if we had our wedding on the ice? You in a mermaid gown, me in a tuxedo. We could have everyone dance on the frozen lake.”On a strange impulse, I walked into the park. In the distance, I could see the gazebo in the middle of the lake, decorated with red silk.Guests were holding champagne flutes. Adrian was adjusting Hailey’s veil.A familiar piano melody drifted through the air: Clair de Lune.“Chloe?” Sarah from marketing walked over, a glass of wine in her hand.Her eyes darted between me and the ceremony on the lawn. “Are you… here for the wedding?”The gossip in her tone was unmistakable. She was practically begging for a scene.I smiled and nodded, then went back to my car to get a card.In the glove compartment were two neat stacks of gilded envelopes, the ones I had prepared for my own wedding.I put three dollars and thirty-three cents in one of them. An unlucky number.On the glass platform in the middle of the lake, Adrian was spinning Hailey around.I walked closer. The ivory lace of her dress cascaded over his arm. Suddenly, my nose started to burn.What I had wanted for so many years, someone else now had.I pushed the emotion back down. “Adrian, congratulations on your wedding.”I placed the card on the gift table and signed my name with a flourish.“Chloe?!” The champagne flute nearly slipped from Adrian’s hand.Hailey, on the other hand, was beaming. “How thoughtful of you, Chloe. When you get married, we’ll be sure to return the favor, doubled.”She deliberately linked her arm with Adrian’s. “But since you’re still single, maybe I could introduce you to one of Adrian’s friends? They’re all millionaires, you know.”She held onto him tightly, her eyes possessive.But Adrian pulled his arm away and grabbed my wrist, dragging me behind a fountain. “Are you stalking me?”The spray from the fountain dampened my sleeve. I took out a tissue to wipe it off.His brow was furrowed, his voice tight with anger. “All the guests are watching. Did you come here to make a scene?”“Don’t be crazy, Chloe. Her dad just wanted to see us have a ceremony. It’s just for show! Don’t do this now. If you piss me off, you won’t like the consequences.”I scoffed and took a step back, avoiding his outstretched hand.“Adrian, you’re a married man. It’s not appropriate for you to be grabbing me like this.”“I just came to give you a card, that’s all.”I turned to leave. In my peripheral vision, I saw him start to follow, but Hailey grabbed his arm.The wedding was still in full swing. No one had noticed the little drama by the fountain.Rain started to fall, hitting my windshield in angry torrents. My phone screen lit up.A text from my mom: Sweetie, come home. Your father has a new project for you in the city.I replied, Okay, sounds good. and started the car.In the rearview mirror, the lights of the gazebo grew smaller and smaller.This time, my youth was really over.As I arrived at the airport, a message from Adrian popped up: Where did you go? I saved you some wedding cake.I deleted and blocked him.As I was getting my luggage, an unknown number called.“Chloe! Where are you?!”I could hear his ragged breathing through the phone.",1,1759571295.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

I (23F) have been friends with someone for 8 years. Friend is 26F. She’s honestly like a sister to me, and this is our first real fight.

It started when she asked me about some commitments I had with her and said she felt like I don’t follow through. I admitted I was upset, and it spiralled from there. I live with chronic back pain, and my pain levels change every day. I told her I’d try my best to stick with the commitment, but some days I just can’t.

The night it blew up, she called me while I was on strong pain medication and also trying to serve dinner. I wasn’t in a good headspace, I was defensive, and the call turned into an argument. She ended up getting my boyfriend involved. I admitted to her a couple of days later that I wasn’t well that night and explained what happened. We had a long phone call where we cleared the air.

Since then, I’ve been updating her a couple of times a week about my diagnosis and what’s been happening. Then I asked if she had time to catch up this weekend. Instead of a simple yes or no, she sent me a really long message saying:

she’s disappointed in me as a friend

she feels like I just complain and dump my problems on her

if she gives advice, I get offended and shut her down

she wants a friendship where we “call each other out on our BS” and “help each other grow, bloom, and flourish”

she believes she’s pushing me to improve out of love, which i understand because thats what friends are for.

What hurt me is that all I did was ask if she wanted to see me. I wasn’t trying to complain, I just wanted my friend.

I’ll admit I did snap at her that one day, but I was in pain and not coping well. I owned up to that afterwards. I’ve also lost friends in the past because I was the one who listened to their problems and got ghosted, so I’m really aware of not putting that weight on people.

Now I feel like she’s avoiding me since she got back from Italy. I’ve asked multiple times to catch up (coffee, a walk, etc.) and she’s always said no. She hasn’t asked me once. Her message made me feel judged, manipulated, and like I can’t share anything without being labelled a complainer.

I love her like family, but I’m honestly questioning if I’ve lost her.

So have i lost my friend of 8 years?

Also note i thought we moved on from this but she keeps circling back like she wants a reaction out of me",3,1759571233.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

1nxpq9y,https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyShine/comments/1nxpq9y/explore_milk_makeup_lip_stain_to_see_if_it_really/,Explore Milk Makeup Lip Stain to See If It Really Lasts All Day,"Milk Makeup 1278 Lip Stain has been on my radar for a while, and I finally got my hands on it. I've been testing it daily for the past few weeks, and there’s a lot to unpack here. This sleek, multifunctional product is designed as a lip and cheek tint infused with vegan collagen, seawater, and aloe. As someone who loves makeup that simplifies my routine, I couldn’t resist trying it out to see if it lives up to the hype.

**Design and Packaging**  
Straight out of the box, the packaging caught my attention. Compact and chic, it fits perfectly in my makeup bag without taking up unnecessary space. The twist-up stick design eliminates the mess associated with other staining products—no accidental leaks here. The translucent cap allows me to quickly spot it in my cluttered drawer, which is always a bonus. Plus, I couldn’t help but appreciate the solid construction that doesn’t feel cheap, even after several uses.

**Performance and Longevity**  
The staying power is impressive for a product described as sheer. I applied the jelly tint early in the morning and noticed that even after drinking coffee and having lunch, the stain was still faintly noticeable. Milk Makeup's claim of long-lasting wear isn’t just talk—it truly delivers. For busy days when touching up is the last thing on my mind, this product holds up remarkably well. It does fade slightly by the evening, but the color fades gracefully, leaving no patchiness.

**The Pros**  
- Easy to apply with its stick format, making it travel-friendly  
- Hydrating formula with seawater and aloe that feels lightweight  
- Provides a natural, buildable color for lips and cheeks  
- Infused with vegan collagen, which adds to the skincare benefits  

[Check Milk Makeup 1278 price on Amazon.](https://paulahansen.com/p/b0cq2xnq79/)

**Texture and Application**  
What stood out immediately was its texture. Cooling jelly is a fitting description—it glides effortlessly over the skin without tugging. I’ve used it on my cheeks for a subtle flush and my lips for a pop of color. The buildable formula allows me to layer it depending on the look I’m going for, whether it’s minimal or bold. It blends seamlessly into my skin, and on my lips, it feels light without the sticky residue you sometimes get with other tints.

**Drawbacks**  
- Limited shade range for those who prefer brighter or deeper tones  
- May not be suitable for oily skin types on the cheeks as it’s quite hydrating  
- Requires layering for those who want highly pigmented coverage  

**Competing Products**  
In comparison to similar lip and cheek tints on the market, this one holds its own. Versus the Benefit Benetint, for example, I found Milk Makeup’s product to be far less drying and easier to apply with its stick design. Meanwhile, the Glossier Cloud Paint offers a similar natural look for the cheeks but lacks the versatility of being used on the lips as effectively. If multitasking products are your preference, this jelly tint has a slight edge.

**Value for Money**  
As someone who’s always eyeing products that give the best bang for the buck, I think this tint is a solid buy for what it offers. It combines makeup and skincare elements, which is ideal if, like me, you’re trying to pare down your routine without sacrificing quality. While it’s not the cheapest out there, its longevity and multi-use functionality make it worth the splurge.

The split was very toxic (particularly from my end) and we cut all communication. 

Since then I've grown massively as a person and am in a much better place both emotionally and financially.

I've had relationships since but I always reluctantly keep comparing them to her, and noone gives me the same feeling as with her. 

Here's a rough draft of what I plan to message her:

""Hey (bleep), I know it's been a long time and we ended on a bad note, but I just wanted to reach out.

Firstly I want to apologise for how I was and how we ended things. I was in a dark place back then, struggled to keep work and hating myself most days. You saw me at my lowest and tried to keep me sane whilst also dealing with your own stuff. I genuinely appreciate what you did for me, I didn't realise it at the time.

The night it ended was a massive wake up call for me, since then I've worked hard and saved and I'm now (dream job). I guess I can only really thank you for that too, wasn't till after we ended I realised how much I didn't actually deserve you, it inspired me to get my shit together

I have no idea what your situation is right now, but I genuinely hope you're doing well.

Obviously I'd completely understand if you ignore this message, or just tell me to go f**k myself. I wondered if you'd be up for meeting for a coffee and a catchup?

All the best

Such a stressful time of our lives but very much worth it. Below is our timeline and documents in case it’s helpful to someone preparing to apply (especially as I used this subreddit lots, and we were applying without a solicitor)!!


I (22F) have been on the SWV for a year and my unmarried partner of three years (23M) was switching from student visa to dependent (which is why there was no biometrics appointments).


Timeline:


🕒 09/08/25 - initial application and submission of documents 

🕣11/08/25 - realised there was an error in the application and had to withdraw it. Thought we’d only get the IHS back but not the fee.

🕦13/08/25 - applied again with all the correct information. 


🕠02/10/25 - got an email confirming the annulment of the initial application and the refund of the full amount (including the application fee, which they did not have to do by law!)

🕣03/10/25 - APPROVAL EMAIL🎉

(PS the refund still hasn’t hit our account which we very much expected but still sad)


Relationship timeline:

💕Met in Jan 22 at university 

💕Moved in together with a bunch of other friends in September 22

💕Moved to two other flats after that, only the last one being a 1 bed

💕as my boyfriend comes from a very religious family in a non-white country, but 1) he is an atheist and 2) I’m white and an atheist, his family wasn’t very… happy about us dating. Therefore this visa was absolutely necessary for us to continue our life. Incredibly grateful that it was approved💪💪


Documents submitted:

✅Notarised affidavit signed by both of us, stating the start date if our relationship and that we do not plan on marrying anyone else but each other

✅Cover letters (x2) from us both, apx 2 pages, giving a brief timeline of our relationship: how we met, renting history, travel history, him meeting my parents(very brief)

✅Cover letter on the initial application being withdrawn: very brief, just two lines to explain

✅Photos: only did 8 photos for the three years, but they included descriptions, and there were several with my family and my graduation picture with him😊

✅2x letters from British friends stating they know of our relationship (I don’t think this was needed but they offered to write those so we included)

✅Money transfers: screenshots of our bank accounts showing small transfers to each other for coffees etc (we split finances rn)

✅Rental agreements covering the three years of us living together

✅As one of the flats we lived on was a house share we got a statement from the landlord (just print of an email) stating he was aware we lived in the same room.

✅Joint bank account statement - although it’s used primarily by me, he has access to my emergency savings there in case of emergency 

✅My work life assurance stating him as beneficiary. I think this was very useful because it was easy to get and showed a strong commitment 

✅Payslips (although I don’t think this was necessary we decided to stay on the safe side)

✅His degree (once again, for the safe side)


Honestly I partly think it took so long because we had so many documents (and we also applied in peak student visa time), but it’s better to be over prepared than under prepared in my opinion!

Sure thing boss, I won't touch anything anymore!","disclaimer: i am not from the US and in my country you do need a specific qualification to become a gatekeeper/security guard and there are different ways to get a qualification, each valued higher than the one before, i was on the second to last from 5 different kinds without a university degree

when i was working in property protection for companys we got a new manager with a high qualification (the highest one without university degree) and he was just dumb. It has been about 20 years that the security company i worked for was in this Reception/security gatehouse and not one person had the thought of labelling every single drawer and cabinet door with a labeling machine (we only used like 4 or 5 in whole) and this guy comes and after a whopping 6 months can still not remember these 5 doors and drawers and decides to label every last of the about 30 doors and drawers. At around the same time the cleaning personnel asked us if this guy does even anything, because he was to dumb to pour his own coffee or even drink it without spilling coffee every single time, came to work and went home when he pleased and did not work a single hour effectively rather than just being present watching others work and pretending to scribble things in his notebook.   


After our employer caught on that this guy wasnt working they stripped him of his company car and demanded him working actual shifts. He got angry about it, because wouldn't you know, he is actually so incompetent that he can't even work alone after 6 month of training and observing us other people that were actually working!

He told me and two other people (one with the lowest qualification and one with the same as me) that we and our qualifactions are worth absolutely nothing, we (as people) are dumb because those qualifications are the lowest and shouldn't be worth anything, in fact they shouldn't even exist. 

For context you gotta know, in this company were two security gatehouses one where all the people and most of the trucks can enter (it was called the ""main one"") and the one for the trucks to exit (it was called the ""lower one"") and without having at least the 4th out of the 5 possible qualifications you cannot work the main because the company doesn't want it.

  
When working the early shift in the lower one you had to do several tours around the company area, making sure everythings intact, as the security cameras weren't covering the whole outside of it but only the side entrances for trucks. The tours ended at the main one and this guy used it every single time to take a toilet break and after he said this to me and the other colleagues the previous day I was fed up, i ran the main one when he was there for work because he was too incompetent and he dare say this? sure thing you get what you spread! This guy took a whopping 85 minutes on the toilet and I just stood there and said to every person ""I am terribly sorry, but our only worker that is allowed to work in the main one is on the toilet in the moment, unfortunately I was deemed not qualified and therefore cannot allow you to enter the company premises"". The trucks were backing up like 100-120m onto the main road, as they cannot back out once they enter the street to the main one, there were an additional like 10-15 visitors and technicians and when i heard he was coming back (the toilet was on the other side of the wall) i announced to the angry mob that the ""skilled worker"" will be there within a minute, grabbed my stuff shouted in his direction ""I'm down to the lower one"" and was gone

He needed like a full hour to get everyone finished up and out of there. A truck just needs to sign a small paper with things like what it would be loading/unloading and its license plate and company name, same for the technicians, and the visitors would need to do the same with the only difference they needed to provide the information who they were visiting.   
In the end he got another slap on the wrist from the employer and the company we had worked for (you can imagine, this wasn't the only thing he had done in this time) and as a premium consequence he was told he will not ever get another company car as he was not even there one year and has already caused trouble several times, as well as having no real future in our security company. 

I also have to say, i already quit the at this point was would be outta there like 2 weeks later iirc

I met this girl at a party about a month ago, and we instantly hit it off. The jokes kept coming, the conversations were fascinating, everything just clicked.
She took me back to her place, and we talked for hours before anything sexual even happened. Afterwards, same thing, long pillow talks.

At that time, I wasn’t looking for a relationship, so I told her I wasn’t after anything serious, and she said she wasn’t either, that it wasn’t the right time for her.
She suggested we see each other again two days later — same vibe, same chemistry. It went so well that I quickly started wondering if maybe I did want something more with her.

But then she went on vacation abroad and started acting cold and distant without any explanation. When she came back, I suggested we meet again, but she kept saying she wasn’t available and never proposed another date.
Then one night, she ran into a girl I had a thing with before, and they both sent me a photo of them together. I panicked and tried to explain, but she said she wasn’t upset — that I had been clear from the start — but that she now realized she was actually looking for something serious.

I asked to meet and talk about it, and she agreed, but on the day itself she stood me up. So we ended up having the conversation over text… She said she didn’t see herself building something with me because we don’t work the same way — meaning that I immediately said I didn’t want anything serious, while she goes more with the flow.

That argument doesn’t really make sense to me, because if we had talked it through, I’m sure we would’ve found common ground.

That’s where the conversation ended, but I still feel like it’s unfinished, and I really want to see her again to talk.

What do you think? Is it worth it, or does it make me look pushy? Do you think she’s hiding another reason for ending things just to avoid hurting me?

Edit: I was thinking of sending her this message:

Hi, I feel like I’d regret it if I didn’t ask one last time, would you like to grab a coffee and talk for a bit? I just think it’d be a shame to end things without at least having one last conversation in person — not necessarily to continue anything, but just to close things off properly and warmly.",0,1759568992.0,dating_advice,2,0.33,False

1nxp6df,https://i.redd.it/gxvxkxcw92tf1.png,'Hardboiled Wonderland and the End of the World' is one of the most wonderful things I've ever read,"I just completed the book, the sky is grey and gloomy outside, just how I like it. I took the final sip of my black coffee after getting done with the scene where the shadow drowns and the dreamreader walks back. What a psychedelic journey this book was man! I read the book faster than I've ever read anything. I will be honest at first; after reading so much of Jay Rubin and Philip Gabriel's translations, it was a little hard for me to get into it because Alfred Birnbaum's style came off as a little more electric and less typical of the slow Murakami style I'm familiar with. But once I got comfortable with the book and realized that there are two narratives running parallel to each other I got so immersed that I just couldn't put the book down. It was so beautiful! The twist where Professor explains the technical stuff and tells how the End of the world is nothing but a world in the narrator's consciousness was interesting, but what was more interesting and beautifully written was the way the narrator (the calcutec) figures out what to do in his final hours. This became my favourite part of the entire book. It was honestly funny and interesting to see what he does in his final hours, knowing he is going to pass into another world in a day or so. The scenes involving him spending time with he librarian were very well written. Also the way he was still concious about what others think of him (like in the part where the well dressed mother looked at him being weird) was also funny. The final montage of him going through all the people he met in his final days, including the less important car rental woman and cab driver, was such good writing. At the same time, the dreamreader's escape from the gatekeeper and then eventually parting with his shadow was sad and intense. The whole accordion and Danny boy segment was beautiful too.

So I have started noticing a series of questionable things lately.

For starters, today morning when I was leaving for the gym, I saw a man around 45-50 peeing facing the road. I am against peeing on roads altogether, but this guy took it to a whole other level - he was peeing facing the road and traffic. Then I saw him looking at me when I was making a turn and started jerking off mid-pee. Subh subh dimag kharab ho gaya.

Then, for quite some time, I have started noticing that men my age (20-35) do not even bother to look anywhere else and completely focus on their workouts. I feel so safe and unbothered around men my age in the gym. But these fucking uncles, they are the ones who gwak most - and not only me, every other woman as well. This asshole of a Buddha keeps on following me from one machine to another. Every time I try to confront him, he makes kutte jaisi shakal.

All my favorite cafes in Jaipur have been taken over by uncles. Not kidding - last week I was sitting in town coffee Sirsi Road, and there was this group of uncles sitting at the next table - ordered nothing, just smoking. Their conversations switched from girls' clothes to Modi to India is best to wife jokes. Saale chutiye, get a life.

Then other instances make me question their existence, like driving skills - ajj subh hi i saw at least two middle-aged uncle and aunty make a turn into a cut with the indicator turned on just before they had to make a turn. Naam kya hai? INDICATOR - YOU NEED TO INDICATE before you make a turn. ladai kar leti mai bhai.

This genuinely makes me question their credibility and contribution to society, except for eve-teasing and paan spots. People claim they are one of the best generations - how?

They lack basic common sense, social conduct, ethical mindset, civic sense, respect for individuality, respect for privacy, critical decision-making skills, and self-respect.

Grinding fine, at number 3, got 18g in, 42g out, 24 seconds. WDT and puck screen used. I'm wondering actually if it's a bit too much in, as yesterday I was doing 16g in and it seemed to work better, could that be a factor?

Also increase the temp by one bar as they came out a bit cold.",2,1759568059.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

My coffee machine has started tripping the electricals to my kitchen as soon as plugged in, even if the plug or machine are not on.

The machine works fine if plugged into other outlets in my flat. Just kitchen where it kills it.

All other appliances work fine in the kitchen, it is only the coffee machine that is tripping the circuit breaker.

Does this sound like: 
A) issue with kitchen electrics
B) issue with coffee machine

I'm mainly looking as to whether this requires calling out an electrician to check the kitchen Electricals, or a call to the coffee machine manufacturers to send out a repair person for the machine. 

Apologies for the lack of details, but I'm not very familiar with terminology.

Many thanks.",1,1759568036.0,AskElectricians,1,1.0,False

1nxoxew,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nxoxew,Is there a better layout for our kitchen dining and living area?,"Hi folks - after some second, third and more opinions please.

Is there a better layout for the living/diner area in our kitchen? Are the sofa, coffee table and dining table in the right place?

Full disclosure - these are photos from the listing when we bought the house - but we have our own versions of the same basic furniture in the same places, and they’re the same basic size. I used these photos because it keeps it simple. We have a larger tv that is lower than on these photos - don’t worry, no TV too high here!

Hopefully you can see the door into the kitchen (out to the garden) is the middle one. This is our main entry/exit to the house so it gets used a lot. 

I can’t shake the feeling there is a better layout possible here. I have thought about swapping the dining table with the sofa, to make a more dedicated living area - but that might be too close to the tv. I’ve wondered if the sofa should have the back to the island instead, looking out into the garden - but we do watch TV in here a lot and that would make it at an angle. 

Over to you experts - is this as good as it can be, or is there another way?

We have been friends for almost 7 years now, we met in uni, I am very close to her family, and we both always have each other’s backs. Both our girl friends (yes, wlw) also became close and we often have double dates. Everything was fine until it wasnt.

Few days ago, we were in her house hanging out and drinking, until she told me that she has been talking to a girl named Sabrina (her ex fling before her current girlfriend, lets call her Lian). I was utterly shocked while she was so casual about it. She showed me screenshots of their messages, her asking Sabrina to hang out in her place, Sabrina calling her their pet names when they were together, and so on. I asked her why is she telling me this and she just answered that it is because I am her best friend and she trusts me. I am still shocked and cannot even process a single word. She was clearly drunk atp and went to the bathroom. Without thinking, I grabbed and opened her phone (we know our passcodes), looked for the messages and took a picture on my phone. I was shaking the whole time and some of the pics were blurry because of it. I put her phone back down on the table and told her I am going to leave as I dont want to feel dizzy to drive. She was still in the bathroom at that time and I just screamed “BYE!”

When I got home, I told my girlfriend. We both cannot believe it as my bestfriend is, for all we know, the most greenest flag of all time. I have known her for a long time and there were no signs of her being like this! We agreed to tell Lian the next day.

The next day, my girlfriend and Lian has planned a meetup in a nearby coffee shop. She brought me along and we went to tell Lian that her girlfriend of 2 years is cheating on her. She asked for proof, I gave her the screenshots. She cried and my girlfriend comforted her. Atp I felt so sad and even felt a little regret, but I cannot back down as I cannot and would not tolerate cheating, EVER. The next day, my girl messaged Lian to ask how is she doing but there is no response. Even the following day, none. I messaged my bestfriend an apology because I felt bad I ruined their relationship, to my suprise, she replied saying “F*ck you snitch, friendship my a*s” then blocked me. I then received messages from our old friend group saying that I was wrong for doing that and that I shouldve just waited for her to tell the truth at the right time.

1nxonpm,https://i.redd.it/il2layry32tf1.jpeg,Arcade Zone: The Game you never heard of is going Extinct!,"Most people grew up with *Mario Party*. Some had *Wii Party*, *Rayman Raving Rabbids*, or *Carnival Games*.  
But for me? It was *Arcade Zone*.

A game that came and went so fast, barely anyone remembers it even existed. But I do. And I still own it. It was *my* party game, my go-to multiplayer pick — not because it was perfect, but because it had soul.

Now, in 2025, it’s not just forgotten. It’s almost extinct.

So here’s everything you should know about *Arcade Zone*: why it’s rare, why it flopped, what’s actually great about it, what’s not—and why, even as a flawed shovelware game, it deserves to be remembered.

# 🕹️ What Even Is Arcade Zone?

*Arcade Zone* was a Wii game released by Activision in 2009, right in the middle of the Wii’s party-game craze. It’s a collection of skill-based mini-games designed to look and feel like classic arcade cabinets—fast, flashy, and twitchy.

But unlike most Wii party games, *Arcade Zone* wasn’t about waggling the controller or relying on luck. It was about reflexes, timing, and rhythm.

Here’s what you’ll find inside:

* **Retro homages:** Games inspired by Atari 2600 classics like *Freeway*, *Megamania*, *Atlantis*, and *Kaboom!*, reimagined for this compilation.
* **Ticket redemption-style games:** Think “whack-a-mole” (*Critter Hitter*), air hockey, target shooting at pirate ships, and more.
* **Vendor mini-games:** Simple but fun food prep tasks like making pizza, corn dogs, and smoothies, using the pointer to complete steps under a time limit.
* **Arcade Master showdown:** Collect enough medals and you face off against the Arcade Master in a final challenge—like an air hockey match—to unlock the “grand prize” game *Kaboom!*.

These “retro” games aren’t strict emulations—they’re updated graphical versions that keep the spirit of the originals. The game also boasts an incredibly underrated electronic soundtrack by Linas Maknys, packed with vibrant, futuristic synth vibes. Honestly, that soundtrack alone sets it apart from 90% of Wii shovelware.

It’s fun. It’s fast. And beneath the rough edges, there’s something special.

# 💔 Why Did It Flop?

Because *Arcade Zone* had everything working against it.

* It came out in 2009, well into the Wii’s lifespan, when the market was already drowning in party games.
* Activision published it quietly, with zero marketing, zero hype, and probably printed only a tiny number of copies.
* It looked like shovelware (even though it wasn’t), so most people probably just skipped it.
* It had no recognizable characters, story, or brand to grab casual players’ attention.

It was dumped on shelves during a time when the Wii was flooded with low-effort mini-game collections—some truly terrible, others just overlooked. When people picked *Mario Party* or *Wii Party* instead, *Arcade Zone* quietly disappeared.

# 📉 Why It’s So Rare — And Why That’s a Problem

Here’s the thing: *Arcade Zone* is so rare, it’s almost becoming lost media.

* No interviews with the developers.
* No official soundtrack releases, not even rips online.
* No dedicated wiki, no fan pages, no speedruns, no mods—just a handful of gameplay clips on YouTube.
* Missing from most game databases.
* Copies sell for $5–$10 on eBay—not because it’s bad, but because nobody really cares.

And that’s heartbreaking.

Every year, more discs get scratched, lost, or thrown away. The Wii Shop is gone. No digital version exists. When these last discs rot or vanish, that’s it.

A real, playable piece of gaming history disappears.

# ⚖️ Is It Actually a Good Game?

Yes and no. Let’s be honest:

**Flaws:**

* Small number of mini-games, some feeling repetitive after a while.
* Basic visuals, clunky menus, and stiff animations.
* Multiplayer is limited—only classic games support simultaneous play, while retro games are strictly turn-based.
* No story or characters to help casual players connect.
* Short overall, with some calling it a “glorified tech demo” (it’s not, though—don’t @ me).

**What’s Good:**

* Every mini-game is skill-based, fast, and replayable.
* No RNG or waggle gimmicks—you win because you’re good.
* The soundtrack absolutely rips. Pure retro arcade energy.
* Difficulty scales well, especially in Master Mode.
* Unique animation style—it just could have used Miis, but didn’t!
* It tries something different. It’s focused. It cares about what it’s doing.

This isn’t a forgotten masterpiece. But it’s a game that tried to do something cool and didn’t get its day in the sun.

# 🔍 There’s Almost No Info Left

Search online and you’ll find:

* A couple of blurry YouTube playthroughs.
* One or two sites listing it without box art or screenshots.
* No soundtrack uploads.
* No developer interviews.
* No preservation efforts.

It’s an endangered game, and nobody’s talking about it.

It’s like the indie coffee shop, the garage band, or the student film of Wii party games. It wasn’t trying to be the next *Mario Party*. It just wanted to exist—to be something a little different in a crowded market.

And now it’s dying quietly because no one knew to care.

# 🛠️ What You Can Do (Even If You’ve Never Played It)

If you believe in game preservation or love obscure lost games, you can help keep *Arcade Zone* from vanishing:

**Easy Actions:**

* Upload gameplay videos or stream it on Twitch.
* Record or rip the soundtrack—even a direct audio capture helps.
* Write about it: blog posts, YouTube retrospectives, TikToks, forum threads—just mention it.
* Scan and upload the box art, manual, or disc to sites like MobyGames or Internet Archive.
* Add info to Lost Media Wiki or r/GamePreservation.
* Tag posts with #ArcadeZone #WiiHiddenGems #GamePreservation.

**Advanced Actions:**

* Reach out to composer Linas Maknys about unreleased tracks.
* Try contacting Activision (a long shot, but hey, why not?).
* Dump the ISO for archival purposes.
* Submit it to retro game archives or preservation-focused YouTubers.

**Most importantly:**  
Talk about it. Comment. Share your memories. Ask around. Even a single Reddit post like this adds to the record.

Because if we don’t talk about it… it disappears.

# ❤️ Final Thoughts

I’m not claiming *Arcade Zone* is a secret masterpiece. It’s not. It’s flawed, short, and looks cheap. It’s shovelware-adjacent.

But someone out there tried.

Someone put real effort into the gameplay.

Someone composed an awesome soundtrack.

Someone wanted this game to *mean* something—even if it never did for the masses.

To me, it did.

It was *my* party game. Not Mario. Not Rabbids. Not Wii Party.

And now, I feel like I’m one of the last people alive who remembers it.

So I’m writing this, not to hype it up, but to save it. To pin it down. So that in 5, 20, or 50 years, someone can look back and say, “Yeah, that game existed. Someone cared.”

I know probably nobody will see this post, but I just wanted to share it, hoping it reaches at least *one* person who’ll take a moment to read. That alone makes me happy—knowing my childhood game still gets some love.

Thanks for reading. 🕹️

Let me know if you’ve played *Arcade Zone*, or if you’re one of the other five people on Earth who remember it.

Or even better… go play it. Before it’s too late.",2,1759566972.0,GamePreservationists,1,0.63,False

I had a previous girlfriend (of 5 years) that I became emotionally detached to. This was due to my feelings being ignored such as not wanting to spend time with me on the farm (big deal in my industry) having sex very rarely, once a month on average and very getting annoyed at me for having lots of work to do so I couldn’t plan things with her if we were to do it it would have to be more spontaneous.

Long story short we broke up.

Just over a couple months ago I met a girl at an event. I was still with my ex at the time (I know what you’re thinking I’m an asshole) she put her number into my phone and we spoke a bit in person while at the event but never did anything other than a kiss.

I went home but we kept in touch. I came clean to the new girl that I had a girlfriend which obviously upset her. I broke up with my gf not because of this new girl but because I already left my relationship emotionally.

Fast forward and the new girl have gone on some unbelievable dates like nobody has ever experienced. She’s met my parents, I’ve met hers and she asked to be official which I agreed and now she’s my gf.

Here’s the rub…… my now ex has not been doing very well mentally to the point where she’s swallowed pills a couple of times and it has resulted in myself and friends taking her to hospital a couple of times. I’ve told my ex I’m there for her if she ever has those bad thoughts which I don’t think is a bad thing considering the circumstances. I haven’t told my ex about my new gf and will keep that from her as much as possible to protect her.

Although my new girlfriend has a guy friend who she says was not official but on and off for a couple years. He’s part of a group of friends that she’s in so it’s kinda hard for her to avoid. So yesterday she told me she met up with the guy for a coffee and long story short he wanted to take her out today on which was essentially a massive date.

The guy knows that she’s spoken to someone (me) but she didn’t tell him that’s she’s now going out with me and I got upset. I said that’s not fair on either of us and she needs to tell him about me. If he’s a friend he will stick around and if not good riddance. For the record I’ve expressed a disliking to this guy.

So after asking her to tell him she said she soft lunched me to him and when she got back to me it sounded like she didn’t mention me at all. She seemed more annoyed at the fact that he was hiding another girl from her which she said wouldn’t have been a problem if he came clean about it.

I told her if I had been in this situation with my ex I would be upset and because of this I am actually up set and she’s hurt me. She’s now turned off her phone for the weekend and not speaking to either of us. Saying she can’t trust either of us (she can’t trust me cause of how I ended things with my ex) although I am fiercely loyal to her and haven’t put a foot wrong so far I’ve been made to feel like I’ve fucked up somehow.

Question is what do I do now ? Wtf as I meant to do or feel here ?",3,1759566710.0,AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC,4,1.0,False
1nxok80,https://www.reddit.com/r/StartUpIndia/comments/1nxok80/i_built_know_founder_a_product_hunt_for_nontech/,I built “Know Founder” — a Product Hunt for non-tech founders,"Hey folks 👋  
I’m Aditya, and I wanted to share something I’ve been building that might help a lot of people here.

👉 **The problem I saw:** Most launch platforms (Product Hunt, IndieHackers, etc.) are tech-first. But non-tech founders (D2C, wellness, food, creators) struggle to showcase and validate their startups.

👉 **What I built:**  
**Know Founder** — a simple platform where non-tech founders can:

* Showcase their startup profiles
* Get early visibility & community feedback
* Find cofounders & connect with investors who understand non-tech businesses

✅ MVP is live → already seeded with 15+ real non-tech startups (coffee, Ayurveda, local food brands, fitness, etc.)  
✅ Free to list your startup right now  
✅ First 100 startups get a “Founding Member” badge & a featured spot

👉 **Link:** [https://www.knowfounder.online/](https://www.knowfounder.online/)

Would love your thoughts:

* Is this useful for non-tech founders you know?
* What would make you (or your founder friends) actually submit your startup here?

I’ll be around to answer questions and get feedback 🙌",2,1759566607.0,StartUpIndia,0,1.0,False

You google recruitment software, skim a few lists, and suddenly you are comparing feature grids instead of talking to people. You just want something that keeps everything together without turning you into a full time admin. One minute you are in your inbox, the next you are copying notes into a spreadsheet, then you realize you forgot to reply to a great applicant from yesterday. You try a couple platforms and learn quickly what matters to you. Clean posting flow, easy screening, simple messaging. When you tested ZipRecruiter, it felt closer to how you already work. You post fast, see matches show up, and keep the back and forth in one place. Not perfect, but less clicking around, which helps when you are already juggling your real job. If you have been down the recruitment software rabbit hole, what did you end up valuing most once you were actually hiring? Was it speed to post, quality of applicants, or just a layout that made sense at 7 am before coffee?

1nxog0e,https://i.redd.it/tpt34c2k12tf1.jpeg,Amy’s Diary — The New Coffee Day Menu Incident!,"This Saturday morning, my friends and I met again at Coffee Day. The place was already full of that familiar roasted-bean aroma that could make anyone instantly cheerful. Zoe and her team were all busy behind the counter, smiling and chatting with customers like always.

We picked a big table near the window, and Carmen excitedly said, “Guys! You have to see the new printed menu!”

I grabbed one from the counter. It looked glossy and brand-new, with Coffee Day’s logo shining in gold letters. But then, as we flipped to the inside cover—there it was! A big, dramatic photo of someone’s waistline, the Coffee Day logo printed right across the middle, with the words “Bold Beans, Bold Flavor!” written in fancy script underneath!

For a moment, everyone just stared in silence. Then, Kira blinked twice and burst out laughing.
“Who designed this?!” she gasped, giggling so hard her ponytail bounced.

Winfrey covered her mouth, trying not to laugh but failing miserably. “It’s... um... artistic?” she said between snorts.

Even Siu Ling and Monique, usually the calmest, couldn’t hold it in. The whole table shook with laughter until Zoe herself came over, smiling in her usual confident way.
“Oh, you girls noticed the new campaign!” she said cheerfully. “It’s called Coffee Day: Dare to Be Bold! It’s about confidence, empowerment, and a little bit of fun.”

Carmen laughed. “Well, it definitely got our attention!”

Zoe winked, clearly proud. “Exactly what we were going for.”

When we finally calmed down enough to order, Mr. Tanaka came by to deliver our drinks, politely pretending not to notice our giggles. I think even he had trouble keeping a straight face when he saw us clutching the menus like they were top-secret comedy material.

Later, when we left the café, Winfrey said, “That’s it — I’m writing a novel about a coffee shop with the world’s most dramatic menu.”
And I said, “Only if I get to be the one who laughs the loudest!”",1,1759566153.0,u_FunRestaurant3384,0,1.0,False

And If I don’t? Then consider this the reason I don’t gamble.

This is going to be **long**, so same disclaimer as last post: I've got ADHD and I'm neurodivergent. Even medicated, I'm going to be all over the place. I'm coming from a place of genuine relatability, but my brain sometimes makes me sound like an asshole when I'm trying to help. Please bear with me.

I'm not claiming to have all the answers. What I do have is this: I've lived this exact life. I've been where you are. My brain is also a dickhead to me. I know what it's like to be the only person in the room who doesn't ""get it.""

But before you invest time reading this, here's the most important thing you need to know:

**There is no magic solution to your problems. This isn't a simple math problem where x = 42. This is a calculus problem – you're taking multiple formulas, splicing them together, and working through a 30-page solution. Right now, Google search “Equation for wave”. It’s fucking complicated. Your issues are fucking complicated. Your issues are unique, because YOU are unique. If you're looking for a cheat code, stop reading. This is a practical guide, not PUA slop where I try to sell you bullshit advice to make money – I actually give a shit about helping you succeed.**

If you’re still reading this, then now is the time where I make my intentions clear. The title wasn’t click bait, it’s just that when you ask “what do I do when I’ve done it all?”, you’re not actually asking the right question. This is the question you mean to ask:

>How will I know when it’s time to stop? When will I be “good enough?”

And the answer? You already are. You just don’t realize it yet, and that’s what we’re going to focus on.

 

**Part 1: What do I do when I’ve done all of the self-improvement I could and still getting ignored by women?**

So the initial assumption I will be working with for this piece is that you have spent years doing all of the self-improvement you were told to do. You went to the gym, you got in shape, you’ve fixed your sleep schedule, you’re damn-near a vegetarian with the amount of greens you’re funneling down, you’ve got the President of the United States calling *you* for inside trading because you’ve got so much cash laying about, and you’re now giving *your* therapist advice.

(This is also being hyperbolic. The actual assumption is whether you spent years with self-improvement of even a few months, what I’m about to tell you is still applicable.)

The point is, You're asking “when will I be good enough?” and measuring it by whether women want you. But that's the wrong question. You **ARE** good enough – you just can't see it because you're still measuring your worth by external validation.

All that self-improvement you did wasn't wasted. But it was incomplete. You improved the outside while leaving the inside untouched. You built a better resume while your brain kept saying “I'm only good enough if someone chooses me.”

You essentially built a resume with a dick. The external change probably doesn’t feel all that great because – well to be frank – *still no bitches*.

And there’s an internal dialogue in the head that shoves out attempts to confront wanton levels of mental destruction that comes with anxiety, trauma, being Autistic, having ADHD, etc. Because at the end of the day, even if you find alllll of the mitigating factors to combat your inner brain’s dipshittery – *still no bitches.*

Unfortunately, the real challenge for you is confronting the voice in your head that says “I'm worthless without romantic love.” And this is what I intend to help you fix. And until you fix that, no amount of external improvement will ever feel like enough. Why? Because as long as “*still no bitches*” continue to be the forefront of your personal woes, no amount of advice, courses, services, or any level of solution-based information will ever move you. You'll stay stuck in this loop – **unless** you address what's actually blocking you.

That internal work you need to do is the scariest work there is. It's easier to add another workout day than confront why you hate yourself. It's easier to improve your wardrobe than face the grief you've been avoiding (foreshadowing). External improvement has clear metrics. Internal work? That's messy, painful, and has no finish line you can see from the start…. So let’s start!

 

**Part 2: The part where I’m probably going to blow your fucking mind**

Right now, there's a compulsive push in your mind that's probably blocking out what I'm about to say. You're convinced I'm just going to tell you to ""accept you'll die alone and unloved."" And yeah, that's a really, really shitty deal. So let me be clear:

**Yes, accept the reality of your situation. No, don't go fuck yourself.**

I desperately need you to understand that I'm not here to tell you to ""just cope"" and ""give up."" But here's the problem: every single piece of advice gets met with resistance because you've been treated like some excess male discarded by society. You filter everything through ""so I'm fucked forever, got it."" There's a lot of resentment and bitterness built up and it’s genuinely hard for you to trust anyone, but I can assure you I have your best interest in mind.

Source: Just trust me, bro.

So what the fuck is actually going on? Why are you stuck in this manic loop of catastrophizing? The answer is deceptively simple:

**You are grieving. And you have probably been grieving for years without recognizing it.**

I'm not a psychologist, so I can't diagnose you. But hear me out. Grieving is a powerful, extensive process. The reason you're so angry and bitter? That's a direct reaction to how you were treated – probably starting at a very young and impressionable age. Home, school, or both.

You grew up with a different mind. You watched everyone around you ""get it"" – they developed socially, mentally, physically. You were left behind. Nobody believed in you. Nobody told you that you were just as capable. They prescribed Formula A for social skills when you – someone who thinks different – needed Formula B, Formula C, or some Frankenstein combination that actually works for your brain.

So, what you are doing right now is you are **grieving** your lost potential. You are **grieving** opportunities you never had. You are **grieving** the window that slammed shut on you. You are **grieving** the “what ifs” of life. It was a big club, and you weren’t invited. You weren’t even offered a seat at the table, you were never given a chance at love, and it **fucking sucks.**

**And you ABSOLUTELY DESERVE that right to grieve.**

When you lose a loved one or a connection to someone, your mind takes forever to fully process that shit. You *have* to go through the phases: the denial, the anger, the bargaining, the depression, the ups and down, all of it. And what happens is your mind fights itself, it knocks itself out, it picks itself back up, and fights itself again, so emotions are a fucking roller coaster. These are not rigid, linear stages that everyone experiences in order, or at all. Grief is a highly personal and variable process – hence the rollercoaster. But eventually – and this is physiological so you can look this up – the mind gets *exhausted* and gives up. That’s when it eventually resolves to **acceptance.**

This isn’t some form of morbid cope. This is an *emotional cyst*: you *need* to squeeze out all the pus and blood from the infection *before* you apply antibiotics.

The antibiotics are those stupid fucking just-world fallacy “normie advice” you fucking hate with a burning passion. But we’ll get there.

The thing about our brains is that we don’t give it enough credit in terms of how fucking powerful and resilient it is. It can take us to the darkest corners and can even drag us to places where we're genuinely wondering if it's worth staying alive. But when you give it the opportunity to actually go through the process, it eventually bounces back to a place of acceptance and neutrality.

**And that's where I want you to be: not happy, but neutral.**

So why is it so goddamn hard to accept your loneliness? Why can't you ""just accept it, bro""? Here's the answer:

**This is a living grief.**

You’re not grieving a dead person. You’re grieving a living situation **that is still possible to turn around**, no matter how low the chances are. No matter how many times you say ""we're cooked"" or ""it's over,"" no matter how much you insist normie advice doesn't apply, there's still that voice in the back of your mind that says *""Maybe I'm wrong? Maybe the problem really is me, and maybe there is a solution to all of this.""*

And that’s the voice you’re probably trying to forcefully drown. Because if there Is still a hope, then that means everything you’ve done has been meaningless, and wasted potential. **There is nothing worse than realizing you could have done something different all along.**

So instead of letting your mind resolve to acceptance, you keep rolling it back to anger, or bargaining, or depression, or denial – some cocktail of bullshit that's cucking you out of your God-given right to **just fucking breathe.**

Want to know the true meaning of Hell? It’s not fire and brimstone and spoiled children screaming in public because they want ice cream. **It’s spending your final day on Earth meeting the person you could have been.** And that is a Hell I want you to avoid.

It's so much easier to accept there are no solutions, that you genuinely are cooked, that there's 0 hope, that your inactions are valid. It's the easiest thing to do. And I don’t want you to do that. Here's what I'm actually asking you to do:

**Stop fighting the grief process.**

Let yourself grieve. Reach acceptance. Find neutral. That's not giving up – that's finally allowing yourself to heal.

And before you say ""but how do I get happy?"" Let me stop you right there:

 

**Part 3: The goal isn't to be happy. The goal is to be neutral.**

This mindset should change everything.

Neutral isn't manic happiness. Neutral isn't ""everything's great!"" Neutral is: ""I'm okay right now in this moment. Life doesn't feel actively painful. I can function without constant emotional warfare in my head.""

From neutral, you can occasionally reach up toward contentment, maybe even happiness. But you can't get there from the bottom of the grief pit. You have to climb to neutral first.

And here's your first step:

Take a piece of paper. **DO NOT copy and paste this.** Physically write down the following:

*I am grieving*  
*I am grieving the life that could have been*  
*I am grieving the opportunities I missed out on*  
*But I will not be grieving forever*  
*Because nothing lasts forever (underline this part)*  
*I will get through this*  
*I will get through this*  
*Because I am worth it*  
*Because I am worth it*

Write those last two parts TWICE because they're TWICE as important. Right now, you might not believe these words. They might seem like colorful bullshit words from a discount bin self-help book. **Write them anyway.**

Tape this next to every mirror in your place. Read it out loud. Then put it down.

Tomorrow? Write it again. Read it out loud. Put it down. And **you do this every day.**

This is building a healthy habit. Whether you realize it or not, you're currently in the habit of being downtrodden. Even if you have a genuine chemical deficiency requiring SSRIs, you're still in the habit of catastrophizing. This exercise starts breaking that habit.

This is your first genuine step toward healing.

**Congratulations! You've generated momentum!**

>None of this bullshit helps, and I don’t want to do it.

Cool. Heard you. You don't have to do this. But I'd like to remind you that **you're on a sub dedicated to solutions, and this is literally a solution that works.**

It's not a grand step. But it's the first step. One small step for man, one giant leap for incel-kind.

>So this is just telling me to cope. Thanks, asshole!

I'm beginning to dislike that word. Not the definition, because ""cope"" literally means ""dealing with something difficult."" But the connotations have been hijacked by pessimists who treat it like a gateway to nihilism and suicide. I don't want that.

Right now, it feels like nobody believes in you. You probably don't even believe in yourself. Hell, I'll venture to guess you probably hate yourself.

This is why I write these long-ass pieces. **Because I don't hate you. And I genuinely believe in you.** A complete stranger. I have no reason to believe in you, but I do anyway because I have what's often defined as faith. I have faith in you.

Even if I'm wrong, I can accept that. Even if my words get flushed down the toilet, I'm okay with that. Because what I'm doing is what you should be doing: **trying. Putting in effort.**

This is how I choose to spend my free time because I believe it's a cause worthy of effort. **What this means is that YOU are a cause WORTHY of effort.**

I'm not trying to glaze you with pretty words. It's my core belief that every single person on this sub deserves the same chances I was given. I used to be like you. I also had a fucked up life. But I was given opportunities many of you weren't – through my Navy travels, through being stuck on a ship for multiple deployments in forced isolation that paradoxically taught me how to connect.

This is the only way I know how to give back. **Because you are worth it. And this is the attitude I want you to have for yourself.**

So keep writing that mantra. Keep reciting it. If you continue to do this, you WILL transition into a phase where you allow yourself to heal.

This is your first step. It won't fix everything overnight. But it starts the process of moving you from catastrophizing toward neutral. And neutral is where you need to be before anything else can work.

 

**Part 4: Hello?? Still not bitches!**

Right now, you’ve probably been told over and over again that “You won’t be able to attract women until you learn to love yourself” or that should “learn to be happy on your own.”

And the general response is one of two things:

A.     HOW DO I LEARN TO COPE WITH THESE INTENSE FEELINGS OF LONELINESS! I WANT TO FEEL LOVED AND DESIRED SO BADLY AND I HATE HOW IT FEELS LIKE I’M SCREAMING IN THE VOID AND STILL BEING IGNORED!!!

B.     Why me? Why do ***I*** have to be the one who gets the shit end of the deal? Why do the more attractive men get to have what I can’t have? Shit genetics have doomed me, and there’s nothing I can do. Why?

See, the problem isn’t the resistance to the advice; it’s the advice itself. This is inapplicable advice. It’s what you tell to children who are still trying to get over their fifth-grade crush, not to a full-fledged adult in their 30s dealing with Autism, ADHD, Anxiety, Depression, trauma, or manic episodes. This is the equivalent of “well maybe you’d be happier if you were just happy and not thinking about all the sad stuff lol”. It’s the equivalent of falling down a well with a cut rope and someone leaning in shouting “have you tried climbing out?”

Motherfucker, you need a ladder!

What I mean to say is that being told dismissive, condescending platitudes serves no purpose but to piss you off and make you feel worse than you already do. So I’m not going to do that.

I’m going to show you *HOW* to do that. If the mantra in Part 3 was the first step, and getting to neutral is key, then what’s the next step?

**Recognize that “still no bitches” is the wrong metric, and it’s fucking your life up.**

You've been measuring your entire worth by one outcome you can't fully control. That's why nothing feels good enough – you're using the wrong metric.

The work is learning to measure by what you *can* control: your movement toward neutral, your willingness to process grief, the life you're building for yourself; not whether women validate you.

The actual metric is: **internal progress toward neutral, measured by actions you control.**

Not ""am I attractive to women?"" but ""am I less miserable than yesterday?"" Not ""did anyone choose me?"" but ""did I take one step toward accepting my current reality?""

The metric is the grief work itself. Process over outcome.

This doesn't mean you stop wanting bitches. You're human – of course you want bitches. But you need to stop treating it as the **ONLY** thing that determines whether your existence has value.

Also, real talk? Don’t call women “bitches” or “females”. ESPECIALLY don’t call women “304’s” – you know who you are.

**Practical Exercise #2:**

Every time you catch yourself thinking “still no ~~bitches~~ romantic connections” or “none of this matters because I'm alone,” you're going to do this:

1. Notice the thought (don't fight it, just observe it)
2. Ask yourself: “What am I actually measuring right now? External validation or internal progress?”
3. Redirect it: “What did I do **TODAY** that moved me 0.1% toward neutral?”
4. If answer is nothing? Do a push-up. Physical fitness is still important – even if this entire post is about the mental aspect of things. In fact, just go and do another push-up. Right now. Good job!
5. Remind yourself: you’re grieving, you’re now *actively* working on getting to acceptance, and from acceptance is neutrality.

This isn't positive thinking bullshit. This is retraining your brain to measure by things you can control: Did you do the mantra? Did you get outside? Did you not catastrophize for a full hour? **Those are wins.** They don't feel like wins because you're still using the “still no ~~bitches~~ girlfriend” scorecard.

This process sucks because you'll still see guys who seem to have it easier getting relationships. Your brain will scream “why them and not me?” **That's the grief talking.** That's the broken metric measuring again. Their success doesn't prove you're failing – it just proves that relationships aren't distributed based on “worthiness”. And that fucking sucks to accept. But that comparison trap is part of what's keeping you stuck.

And to top it off, when you speak up about it, you’re instantly labeled as an entitled douchebag who should probably stay alone – all for the high crime of venting your frustrations. And when you reach out seeking solutions to this frustration, you are then instantly piled on by other users lining up to swat you down, destroy your ego, and put you in your place.

How do I know this? Because I saw that exact thing happen the other day. Friends, we are supposed to be helping each other, not competing for who can deliver the harshest reality check. Please keep this in mind when responding to these types of posts. After all, some of us struggle with how we form our words.

The best practice is to take a topic labeled as “seeking solutions” in good faith without assuming the worst about their character.

Also? These frustrations are completely valid, and it’s a **really fucking hard** illusion to break through. So, let’s talk about that!

 

**Part 5: When other guys get** **~~bitches~~** **romantic connections and you don’t**

You're going to see couples everywhere. Coffee shops, work, social media, the grocery store. Guy at work casually mentions his girlfriend. Your friend posts couple photos. Some random dude at the bar is clearly on a date. Guy you know who just got out of prison for beating his ex is now talking to three different girls at the same time, and all of them are absolute models.

And every single time, your brain screams: ""Why them and not me?""

Believe it or not, the answer isn’t because you’re an entitled narcissist stuck in a just-world fallacy like your detractors would have you believe. Here’s what’s actually going on:

You're not just feeling envy. You're using their success as evidence of cosmic injustice. If **HE** can get a girlfriend and **I** can't, then something is fundamentally broken - either with the universe or with me.

This is grief talking. **Not narcissism.** Specifically, the anger and bargaining stages. ""It's not fair"" is a grief response. You're stuck comparing your ""could have been"" life to their actual lives. And when you judge them, you fall into a comparison trap.

And the more you judge, the worse it gets.

When you catch yourself thinking ""he doesn't deserve her"" or ""I'm better than him in every way"" – that's your brain trying to make sense of perceived injustice. It's creating a merit-based hierarchy where you **SHOULD** win. And when you don't, it feels like proof the system is rigged against you.

**Once again, this isn’t narcissism or arrogance. This is an emotional trigger, and it’s surprisingly normal. I say ""surprisingly"" because this is probably the first time you’re hearing someone say that this response is par for the course.**

But here's the thing: **relationships aren't distributed based on worthiness.** They're about compatibility, timing, social circumstances, luck, and a thousand variables you can't control. Observing that someone you consider ""less worthy"" has a relationship doesn't prove you're failing. It proves relationships aren't meritocratic.

And yeah, that fucking sucks to accept.

And to make it worse, due to the insane amount of variables involved, you can’t just “do what that guy did” because it’s impossible to recreate someone else’s situation. “Chad” isn’t acting cocky and funny because he’s tall and attractive; he’s doing it because he was raised to not give a shit. He very well may have grown up in a shitty foster care center where everyone had to fight for themselves, which naturally toughened him up. He may have had a sister at a young age who taught him how to dress himself and style his hair. He may actually be peacocking because he read one of those stupid fucking PUA books Neil Strauss pumped out in the 2000s and is simply trying to “fake it til you make it.”

Or Chad could have grown up lucky with loving parents, good emotional support, had enough talent to make the sports teams at a young age, and wore that confidence through his adolescence so he’s really, really socially and financially successful because he was at the right place at the right time. You simply don’t know. You don’t know their life. You don’t know their story. And their life and story are not yours. Even if it feels like you’re living in “Chad’s” shadow, you still have an option to walk out into the light and cast your own.

At the end of the day, this is your story. So how do we regain our own story?

**Practical Exercise #3:**

When you see a couple and feel that spike of anger/envy/comparison:

1.      Notice it: ""There's that comparison pain again."" **Don't fight it – it'll just get stronger**

2.      Recognize that it's grief talking: ""This is grief. This is the living grief reminding me of what I don't have."" “That's the broken metric again. I'm measuring by things I can't control."" This is a grounding technique. BTW you’re doing great!

3.      Remind yourself: ""Their relationship says nothing about my worth. It is not proof of my failure They got lucky/worked for it/whatever. That's their story, not mine""

4.      Let it pass: Don't ruminate. Don't build a case for why you're better. Just acknowledge the feeling and let it go. ""Am I moving toward neutral? Did I do my mantra today? What's one thing I control right now?""

5.      Let it pass: Don't fight the feeling. Let it exist. It will fade. **Nothing lasts forever.**""

>But OP, **NOBODY** acknowledges or gives me a chance!

I know, and it sucks. But you can’t let a bad 5 minutes ruin the rest of the 23 hours and 55 minutes of your day. Sometimes you'll see genuinely shitty people in relationships. Abusers. Cheaters. People who treat their partners terribly. That's real, and it's infuriating.

But their success doesn't prove that being good guarantees nothing. It proves that relationships are messy, complicated, and not distributed by some cosmic fairness algorithm.

*“You can do everything right and still not get the outcome you want. That's not weakness – that's life.”*

(Thanks, Captain Picard.)

The goal isn’t to stop caring. The goal is to stop using other people's relationships as evidence that you're fundamentally broken. Stop letting their success dictate your worth. Stop letting the burn in your chest rule your life.

You're grieving. You're working toward neutral. Their story has nothing to do with yours.

 

**Part 6: The never-ending uphill battle**

This is long-term work. You're not going to reach neutral in a week or even a month. You'll have good days where you feel progress, and bad days where you're right back in the grief loop. That's normal. That's how this works.

The mantra, the metric shifts, the comparison redirects – these are tools. You'll forget to use them. You'll resist them. You'll think they're not working. Keep doing them anyway.

This post is just the foundation. Getting to neutral is Step 1. There's more work after this – building a life you actually respect, developing social skills, addressing whatever neurodivergence or mental health issues are in the mix. We'll get there. But first, you need this foundation.

You can't build a house on quicksand. Right now you're grieving, catastrophizing, measuring by broken metrics. Until you address that, nothing else will stick. So start with the grief work. Start with reaching neutral. Everything else builds from there.

I'm not promising you'll find love. I'm not promising happiness. What I'm promising is that if you do this work, you'll stop being at war with yourself every waking moment. And that's worth it even if nothing else changes.

You're worth the effort. Now prove it to yourself.",3,1759565949.0,IncelSolutions,0,1.0,False

Looking for some outlandish, slightly unorthadox, highly unlikely Cinderella-esque roleplay that dreams and fantasies are made of. Slice of Life is a must, and so is good grammar. Long-term roleplay always. Steamy love scenes must be earned and built up! 

Today, I'm looking to roleplay a situation where an average woman (played by you) has her average, mundane life suddenly interrupted by the too-good-to-be-true miracle of matching up with an extremely attractive billionaire on a dating app. And while at first it may seem like some kind of catfish prankster joke, the more she looks into his profile, the more legit he becomes. But the question that will haunt her forever would be this:

Why would a man like him have matched with a woman like her? 

Wading through all the weirdos and the men who just want hookups and cheap coffee dates has finally paid off. At least, it seems as such! Could there be a catch? She'd have to go on a date with this mysterious stranger to find out! 

As a secondary option, we can also set this Cinderella Story on a college campus. The nerdy, unattractive girl being noticed by the most amazing, popular man at the university is a very enticing concept to me. You'll get complete freedom of choice for your character!

I'm available for roleplay all day today, and if we have good writing chemistry, we could continue for as long as it takes until the story concludes; however it may. Hit me up in DMs if you're interested! This ad has no expiration date. ",1,1759565741.0,RoleplayPartnerSearch,0,1.0,False
