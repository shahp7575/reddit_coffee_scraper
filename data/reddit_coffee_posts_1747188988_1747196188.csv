1km6a8g,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverfifty/comments/1km6a8g/advice_for_a_we_met_irl_first_date/,advice for a we met IRL first date,"53M, divorced dad of two adult daughters 

Met someone at a friend‚Äôs concert‚Äîshe is friends with his wife. The bar was dog friendly and I brought my dog. She also brought her dog and they were inseparably cute together. She suggested we should get our dogs together and that we could watch each other‚Äôs dogs.

A few days later I asked her for the dog date and she suggested we also get coffee. Date is this weekend.

I have asked my friend/his wife to vouch for me and also see if she is interested. Haven‚Äôt heard the result of this yet. She is single.

I‚Äôve been on countless OLD dates, had two short relationships, made a few good, legitimate female friends along the way. 

 I‚Äôm interested in dating beyond our pets but she may not be, which would be a bummer,
but I‚Äôm ok if it isn‚Äôt in the stars as I think our dogs would be fun together and who doesn‚Äôt want free, reciprocal pet care? 

I‚Äôm thinking it won‚Äôt happen quickly if it‚Äôs in the cards so what‚Äôs the best strategy to show interest and what signals should I look for? Any other IRL vs OLD advice?

1km68wk,https://www.reddit.com/r/SMCIDiscussion/comments/1km68wk/why_we_are_still_cheap_next_target_price_is_944/,Why we are still cheap: next target price is $94.4,"Alright, let‚Äôs dive into why our smci at its current price of $40 feels like a steal, especially after their blockbuster deal with Saudi Arabia. This contract is a game-changer, and I‚Äôm convinced the stock is wildly undervalued compared to other AI players. I‚Äôd argue the fair value sits comfortably between $90 and $120, and we‚Äôre likely in for a serious rally from here. Here‚Äôs the breakdown, written from the gut like I‚Äôm explaining it over coffee.

The Saudi deal is massive. Saudi Arabia‚Äôs pouring billions into AI and data centers as part of Vision 2030, and SMCI just locked in as a key supplier of high-performance servers and AI-optimized gear. This isn‚Äôt some one-off order‚Äîit‚Äôs a signal SMCI‚Äôs tech is critical for the kind of heavy-duty infrastructure the Kingdom‚Äôs betting on. With over 70% of SMCI‚Äôs revenue already tied to AI GPU platforms, and their tight partnership with NVIDIA for cutting-edge Blackwell chips, they‚Äôre not just riding the AI wave‚Äîthey‚Äôre helping steer it. This deal opens doors to more contracts in the Middle East, and that‚Äôs a region with deep pockets and big ambitions.

Now, let‚Äôs talk about the stock price. At $40, SMCI is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio (PER) of about 17, based on an estimated annual EPS of $2.36. Compare that to the AI sector, where companies like NVIDIA are commanding PERs of 50-60, and even less flashy names are sitting at 30-40. SMCI‚Äôs growth trajectory‚Äîthink $5.6B to $6.4B in revenue guidance for Q4 2025‚Äîscreams that a PER of 17 is absurdly low. 

If you slap a conservative 30x PER on their earnings, the stock‚Äôs worth $70.80. Push it to 40x, and you‚Äôre at **$94.40!!!** 

And if the market starts treating SMCI like a true AI leader (say, 50x PER), we‚Äôre talking $118. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm pegging the fair value at $90-$120. Analysts are already sniffing around, with price targets averaging $41.29 and some as high as $60, but I think they‚Äôre lowballing it.

Sure, SMCI‚Äôs had its bumps. That accounting mess and talk of delisting spooked investors, but the noise is clearing. The Department of Justice probe seems to be fizzling, and if they file their business report by February 25, 2025, the delisting threat vanishes. Plus, their financials are rock-solid: $627M in operating cash flow last quarter, a net cash position of $44M, and new facilities to ramp up production globally. This isn‚Äôt a company scraping by‚Äîit‚Äôs one gearing up for a boom.

So why‚Äôs the stock still at $40? Market‚Äôs sleeping on it. But the Saudi news is a wake-up call, and I see serious momentum building. The AI market‚Äôs set to grow 20% annually for years, and SMCI‚Äôs tech is at the heart of it. Once the accounting fears fully fade‚Äîespecially after their February 11 business update‚ÄîWall Street‚Äôs going to reprice this fast. Technicals are lining up too; if the 20-day moving average crosses above the 60-day, that‚Äôs a golden cross, and traders will pile in. Short-term pops are likely, but the real story is the long-term climb. This stock‚Äôs got legs to hit $90-$120, and I wouldn‚Äôt be shocked if it overshoots.

Bottom line: SMCI at $40 is a screaming buy. The Saudi deal proves they‚Äôre a heavyweight in AI infrastructure, and the market‚Äôs undervaluing their growth by a mile. Expect a steady grind higher, with some sharp pumps along the way as sentiment catches up. Just keep an eye on the broader market and those filing deadlines‚Äîstocks don‚Äôt move in a straight line. But man, this one feels like a rocket ready to launch.",2,1747195951.0,SMCIDiscussion,1,1.0,False

There's no CS during peak and the cafe/front person usually juggles being cafe, warming, coffee, and watching the milk/cream timer. Sometimes it's a hassle to go to the back and prep carafes when there'sa lineup. What i did was I would prep 2 carafes (1 milk and 1 cream) and store it in cold bar fridge. That way when the 2 hour timer goes off, I'll just grab it from the fridge and date it and put it out. This helps when it's busy. My manager told me i couldn't do this since we use the time as a public blah blah thingy, and i had to dump out the carafes in the fridge that I prepped. It doesn't make sense since it's in the fridge anyways and all i had to do was set the timer? Is this a health and safety thing?
Because we used to store carafes in the fridge before, and they were good for 24hours unused. I don't know why I was made to dump filled carafes i stored in the fridge. I found it wasteful.

# First It Was Ants. Then It Was Everything.

At first, it was just a couple of ants. No big deal. Then came the roaches. Then spiders. Then‚Ä¶ *things with wings* that I refuse to name.

I called [**pest control in Sarasota, FL**](https://www.wavespestcontrol.com/pest-control-sarasota-fl/) like my life depended on it (because my sanity definitely did).

They‚Äôve got fertilization, pest monitoring, and weed control all dialed in. Now my lawn is lush and actually walkable.

# We Also Had Termites, Because Why Not?

After a panicked call, I booked a [**termite inspection in Sarasota**](https://www.wavespestcontrol.com/termite-inspection-sarasota-fl/), and yep‚Äîswarmers were setting up shop.

1km61nl,https://www.reddit.com/r/QNX/comments/1km61nl/recreating_the_sdp8_raspberry_pi_quickstart_image/,Recreating the SDP8 Raspberry Pi 'Quickstart' image,"For anyone that needs to make modifications to the ""Quickstart"" RPi image for SDP8 - you might want to read this.

If you have built the Raspberry Pi BSP for DP8 you know it is building a single IFS and you'll need to take care of the partitioning, create a EFS, modify scripts, ... etc. Like me, you've likely started with the Reference image and got spoiled by all the goodies it came with.

So what if you want to make it boot faster? Or change the startup script?  Well, you need to find the build for the reference image. If you have found the repo  - please share it here. if not, here is how to make a BSP that actually builds a clone of it.

Before all, this is a ""what to do""  and NOT a ""how to do"" guide. It does assume you know your way with both QNX and QNX BSPs. As an absolute minimum, you must be capable of following successfully this post: 

[QNX Image (IFS) Build tutorials - Raspberry Pi4 specific](https://www.reddit.com/r/QNX/comments/1i0xf9p/qnx_image_ifs_build_tutorials_raspberry_pi4/)

If you are still interested, this is what you need to do:

1. Dump the contents of the ""Quickstart"" RPi image to a folder on your build machine. Copy all data from all partitions except the links.

How: Flash an SD with the image and boot from it. Now pick a dump method you feel comfortable with: 

* Connect over network from the build machine to the target and use SSH/SCP. 
* Or plug a USB Flash Drive to the Pi and do a recursive copy. 
* Best option is to use ""target filesystem navigator' view in Momentics to do what I did with WinSCP. 

2. Unpack the **""BSP\_raspberrypi-bcm2711-rpi4\_br-hw-rel\_be-800\_SVN999745\_JBN198.zip""** into a build folder. I used 'rpi-image'. 

3. Copy the IFS, DATA and SYSTEM build files from the dump /proc/boot/build to the build folder/images folder

I can't possibly imagine why leave them there and not in the package of the ref BSP, but ... hey, I'll take a Christmas gift when one wants to shove it into my hands 

    ls -al ./qnx_workspace/SDP8-RPi-RefImageDump/proc/boot/build/
    drwxr-xr-x 2 deb deb  4096 May  2 10:32 .
    drwxr-xr-x 3 deb deb  4096 May  2 10:32 ..
    -rwxr-xr-x 1 deb deb  6954 Oct  2  2024 data.build
    -rwxr-xr-x 1 deb deb  7800 Oct  2  2024 ifs.build
    -rwxr-xr-x 1 deb deb  3090 Oct  2  2024 options
    -rwxr-xr-x 1 deb deb  4354 Oct  2  2024 options.inc
    -rwxr-xr-x 1 deb deb 39335 Oct  2  2024 system.build



4. Modify the /images/Makefile to build the quckstart IFS image instead of the BSP original IFS image

How: Open the <yourBuildDir>/images/Makefile and find this:

    #all: ifs-$(BOARD).bin ifs-$(BOARD).ui
    all: ifs-$(BOARD).bin
    
    # to boot QNX ifs-rpi4.bin IFS image, add ""kernel=ifs-rpi4.bin"" to bootable microSD card config.txt file.
    ifs-$(BOARD).bin: $(BOARD).build
    $(HOST_MKIFS) -v -r$(INSTALL) $(MKIFSFLAGS) $^ $@

Make it look like this:

    #all: ifs-$(BOARD).bin ifs-$(BOARD).ui
    #all: ifs-$(BOARD).bin
    all: $(BOARD)-ifs.bin
    
    $(BOARD)-ifs.bin: ifs.build
            $(HOST_MKIFS) -v -r$(INSTALL) $(MKIFSFLAGS) $^ $@
    
    # to boot QNX ifs-rpi4.bin IFS image, add ""kernel=ifs-rpi4.bin"" to bootable microSD card config.txt file.
    ifs-$(BOARD).bin: $(BOARD).build
            $(HOST_MKIFS) -v -r$(INSTALL) $(MKIFSFLAGS) $^ $@

What that does is instead of making ifs-rpi4.bin from rpi4.build, will now make rpi4-ifs.bin from ifs.build. In hindsight the naming cannot be more confusing. 



5. Solve all build issues for IFS 

Grab a confy chair and coffee, cross your heart 3 times and punch in the magical build commands:

    make install
    make images

The first one will pass with some compilation warnings, the second will fail gloriously. Get the 'MKIFS' build command near the end of the build output. it should look like this:

    mkifs -v -r../install  ifs.build rpi4-ifs.bin. 

You can use that to fast-build from withing the './images/' dir. 

The cause for failing that the 'ifs.build' comes from a build environment where every single target file exists in these locations:

    /builds/workspace/OSG-RPI4_br-opensource_demo_be-800/images/rpi4/firmware
    /builds/workspace/OSG-RPI4_br-opensource_demo_be-800/images/rpi4
    /builds/workspace/OSG-RPI4_br-opensource_demo_be-800/install/qsc_qnx800/sources/rpi4_snd

The BSP build we're using is based on the 'prebuilt/instal' + 'qnx800/target/aarch64le' aproach. That (if I recall) was using MKIFS\_PATH and the -r<buildroot> MKIFS parameter to search for files. The 'ifs.build' overrides that with a globally placed \[search=\] attribute. Unless you want to recreate the original build I suggest you do this:

a) prepend \[search=../install:../install/aarch64le:../install/aarch64le/boot/sys ... to the search path inside 'ifs.build'

b) replace the missing build paths above with fully qualified hard-coded paths to the equivalent SDP8 folders. In my case with '/home/deb/qnx800/target/qnx/aarch64le/...:' 

c) copy every file that you get a file missing warning where it belongs in the '../prebuilt/aarch64le' dir of your build



Steps a) & b) solve the hard stop for missing raw.boot and startup-bcm2711-rpi4 files. The c) fixes the following 7 warnings:

To solve this all you need to do is to copy these from the dump to prebuilt dir and you're done!

  


6. Replace on the target FAT partition and boot

Reminder we just built rpi4-ifs.bin, while the config.txt in the FAT partition has 'kernel=qnx\_sdp.ifs'. Why did you use that name again?

  


7. Build the SYSTEM and DATA as well

I didn't. If someone does it - please add details in the comments. For my hobby project I only needed the IFS to NOT launch few things.

  


8. Dump the SD Card  into an image file

Use whatever tool you already have. Win32DiskImager for Windows or DD tool on the build machine.



That's it. You did it.

Beyond just the convenience, I can also adjust the brewing settings (strength, water level) remotely and experiment with different strengths without having to fumble with buttons half-asleep.

I‚Äôm a 25 year old female currently working as a payroll specialist. It‚Äôs not what I see myself doing long-term, but while my husband is in nursing school, I‚Äôm the main provider and the job pays well for now.

My work background started in high school as a dance instructor for kids, then I worked as a barista in college while studying kinesiology. I‚Äôve always been athletic and wanted to go into sports medicine, but realizing it required a doctorate discouraged me. Without a clear goal, I lost motivation and eventually dropped out. Around that time, I was promoted to assistant manager at the coffee shop. I loved being in a leadership role and working with my team, and they seemed to really appreciate me too.

After moving to be with my partner, I left that job and worked as a caregiver for adults with disabilities. I enjoyed the personal connections, but overnight shifts triggered a lot of anxiety. Despite performing well and even getting promoted, I had to leave after my request to stop overnights was ignored. Then I worked as a server and bartender and was quickly promoted again. I‚Äôve always been a dedicated, reliable worker who genuinely enjoys helping people even on hard days, I still show up and try my best.

At my current job, I started as a clerical specialist, then moved into accounts payable, and now I‚Äôm in payroll. While I‚Äôve continued to grow, I‚Äôve realized that working in accounting isn‚Äôt the right fit, especially with my dyscalculia. I also don‚Äôt enjoy sitting at a desk all day. I want something more exciting, creative, and fulfilling. I‚Äôm a naturally emotional but logical person. I get some social anxiety but still enjoy connecting with others.

Here are some careers I‚Äôve considered or been encouraged to look into 

-Education
-Counseling / Therapy / School Psychology
-Park Ranger / Parks & Rec
-Firefighter / EMT
-CSI / Underwater CSI
-Veterinary Technician
-Film or Music Industry
-Wildlife / Marine Biology (especially animal rescue/rehab)
-Search and Rescue Specialist

The problem is I‚Äôm interested in all of these things. I wish I could try every one. But how do I figure out which is the right path? How do I know what I‚Äôll be good at or what will truly fulfill me? And I'm aware some of these I would even need to go back to school. Any advice on these careers is welcomed!

I am looking to pair it with a $200-$400 electric grinder and need some advice. I also drink brewed coffee and would love to be able to grind for that as well.

Here are the specs that I am looking for:

* single dose
* does both espresso and brewed coffee well

I am currently looking at these as options:

* Baratza Encore ESP
* DF54
* Eureka Mignon Zero

I know that these are not all in the same league, but thought I would include them all. I am a little nervous about buying a DF54 because of customer service and what continued service may look like. I also did not add the DF64 to this list because I don't plan on modding. I am totally open to other recommendations not included in this list. I know the Niche Zero is a loved grinder and may be swayed to up my budget if it is worth it.

1km5tqn,https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/1km5tqn/my_crazy_neighbor_poisoned_my_creek_and_stole/,My crazy neighbor poisoned my creek and stole water,"This is my post in neighborsfromhell. 

I live on a large property with a small house in the front. There are many small hot springs in the semi-rural mountain area that I live in, with many used by homeowners in their backyard. Many are piped indoors, but some have hot tubs built around them. I happen to have a active one in my backyard (picture an in-ground hot tub being fed in from the hot spring) near my left neighbors house (I'll call her CN for crazy neighbor). A small stream runs through the far backyards of the neighborhood and it used for gardens and little nature areas that everyone on the street enjoys. I have my small fruit/pepper garden watered by this stream and take really good care of it. For some visualization, it has a good amount of water flowing down and everyone on the street uses it some way. My right neighbor (who's a really chill dude, who I'll call Jay) has small pools he made that are fed by the stream, and two neighbors down has a garden similar to mine. Now on to the actual story.

  
When I bought the house, the previous owners were sued by CN, her claiming that the land was rightfully hers. I don't know the details of her argument, but it was thrown out (as far as I know). The previous owners warned me of CN and not to engage with her family. When I moved in, CN's kids (I'd say probably 8, 9, and 10) brought over cookies and welcomed me to the neighborhood. I thought that the previous owner was exaggerating as they seemed sweet. I invited CN and her family to a small BBQ and they accepted. The second that they got in the house, CN started to explain the 'rules of the neighborhood'.  I thought it was pretty normal (like to not play loud music after 9, keep your car in the driveway to keep the street uncluttered, etc. Common sense rules) until she got to some rules reguarding the stream and the hot springs. 

  
She said that kids were allowed in all parts of the stream (in private backyards) and that everyone could use eachother's hot springs (I have the only hot spring on the street, so I was surprised by that). I interrupted her and told her that I wasn't comfortable with those, and she scoffed, saying that all neighbors were fine with it. I told her that I still wasn't comfortable with it. She ignored me, continuing with some questionable rules. The rest of the night was fine, but I felt like I wouldn't want to do it again. 

  
I talked to some neighbors across the next couple days, who all told me to steer clear of CN and that her rules were BS. I went over to CN's house and told her that I had talked to the other neighbors and that I wasn't comfortable with anyone being in my backyard without my permission. She scoffed and said ok. I had a lunch with Jay and he told me who CN was: A serial suer with her lawyer on speed dial to get whatever she wants. CN had sued a small chain pizza place in town into debt for having peanut oil on her pizza when she was allergic to it. The pizza chain didn't even have peanut oil (and many people in the small community believed that she put it on), but still lost everything. I decided not to ever talk to her or her family.

  
A week later, I got home from the grocery store to see CN's kids (I'll call them EKs for entitled kids) splashing in my hot spring tub (its outside and usually has a lid on that two small kids would definitely not be able to take off as it is heavy and large). I tell them that they're not allowed in it and to leave my yard immediately, and they stand their ground, telling me that their mom (CN) told them that it was theirs and that they could use it. I told them that that's not true and to leave now. They finally do. Before you think that I'm an asshole for that, remember that pools/hot tubs are dangerous and I don't want to be liable. I headed back out to buy locks for my gates. When I got back, CN was now there, demanding why I kicked her kids out. She reminded me of the ""rules"", but I told her to leave immediately and that my security camera was recording. She cursed at me for a min or two, then left. I was bluffing as I did not have security cameras, but I did order them on amazon that night. The next day was fine, replanting a lot of my plants from my apartment's balcony into the empty garden (the one that's watered by the stream). I noticed that CN kept looking over the fence.

  
For the following weeks, CN complained about the trees in my yard, the color of the fence, what I'm doing with the stream, etc. Jay occasionally came over and told her to f off. Three weeks ago, I left for a couple days for a friend's wedding. I kept getting security alerts saying that there was motion in my backyard, often her kids playing in my garden (trampling my dear shishito peppers). I texted Jay to tell them to get out. If you're wondering why not call the police, they wouldn't do anything as they're just some kids. I had a suspicion that CN was telling them to do these things, but I didn't have much evidence.

  
On the drive back, I got a security alert that there was motion in my backyard. I didn't check as I was driving, but when I stopped for gas, I checked and saw CN instructing a plumbing team installing piping from MY hotspring into THEIR yard. I had it save all of the footage and I sent messages to Jay about it. Jay told them that they weren't allowed to be doing that, but since it wasn't his house, they didn't listen to him. I called the police and they went, but they had already installed the piping. The team was just leaving through the gate (with a broken lock on the ground), when the police showed up. They said that they had been hired by the homeowner. The police waited for me to get there while talking to the team of workers, and I told them that I was the homeowner and that I hadn't payed them to do it. They looked confused. I went with the police into the backyard and I started ripping the unsecured piping out with a crowbar. 

  
CN starts shrieking from her yard and puts her head over the fence and starts yelling that I'm destroying private property and that she would sue me. CN then says that she has a contract with the owner of the house to have their (my) hot spring water. The police are now confused. She shows a contract that read that  she was paying me $2 per month in exchange for the water. CN won't give it to me so I could look at it besides waving it around in the air. The police eventually leave and warn me not to destroy the piping. I ripped up the small pipe that connects to the source as she's telling me that she'll see me in court. I contacted my lawyer and she said that CN had no case as she didn't know my signature and it would be easy to prove it was forged. I still haven't been served by CN's lawyer, but know that I will soon. In the meantime, I've been sitting in the hot tub for long baths while talking to myself loudly about how much I love it. Petty, but it made me feel good hearing the growls from across the fence.

  
This is the final thing that made me post here, my garden wilting and dying at an unnatural rate. I heard a commotion out in CN's yard and I peeked over and saw her slowly pouring a massive jug of chemicals into the communal stream, which goes down to mine. I don't know if its herbicides, plant killer, or something like bleach (it doesn't smell like bleach so I don't think its that), but its rapidly killing my plants. I haven't eaten any of the fruit/peppers since as I'm worried I might get sick. I think that if I can get definitive proof of her doing it, I can maybe use it in court to prove how crazy she is. People swim in pools from the stream, so I warned Jay not too for the time being and told him to tell others. I know one neighbor removed her garden from the soil and moved it away from the stream just in case it got down to hers.

  
I'm unsure of what I should do next. I don't think I live in a two party consent state for video recording as it doesn't list it as one on the pdf I found. I might crosspost this into legal advice just in case (I do already have a lawyer, but it might be useful hearing free opinions from the internet).

Edit: I forgot to say that I had water testing sticks arriving tomorrow.

TLDR: Crazy neighbor steals hot spring water and pours chemicals into communal stream, poisoning my garden

Update 1: Jay offered to use a large drum in his garage to temporarily remove the water from the stream and seeing your comments, I‚Äôm taking him up on his deal. All the neighbors down the street that I‚Äôve talked to so far (two besides Jay) agreed. One who has two sons said that they might block off the start of the stream. It is a small outlet of a moderately sized creek. It will probably be blocked off not that hard. Jay said that he can probably get the drum in place by tonight as his dad can help. Jay also has a sweet dog and definitely wants to protect it. I am going to remove my plants from the soil nearby the stream. Also, for reference in size of the stream, it‚Äôs about 1-2 feet across. Truly just a stream. There‚Äôs lots of obstacles and things that would probably filter out, but we definitely still have to be safe. I‚Äôll update later tonight or tomorrow.

Update 2: Big news! The nice neighbors‚Äô kids dammed up the stream at where it starts. It‚Äôs a couple pieces of wood, a branch or two, and a lot of small rocks. There‚Äôs still a tiny bit of water flowing, but it‚Äôs absorbed by the soil higher up before CN. Jay got the drum out, but we turned out not to need it. There‚Äôs water still in the pools in his backyard and we plan to do a water test. Apparently pH tests are sold in a store just 10 mins away, so I will head there as soon as I finish this post.

Update 3: Jays getting the pH test and an oxygen level test, but I don‚Äôt know how oxygen levels would play into it. I‚Äôll look at responses and figure out what to do next. I will call authorities soon.

Update 4: The water test: pH came lower than the creek water before CN‚Äôs house (a full .9 lower). Nitrates a bit higher, Dissolved Oxygen significantly lower. That‚Äôs the only real changes in between the two tests. I wonder if she just poured a lot of vinegar. I think herbicides do change pH, but .9 is quite a bit I think.

Update 5: Big update! The makeshift dam broke and water has been flowing down, but it‚Äôs been slow. CN complained to a neighbor up the street that she‚Äôs on speaking terms with about me being a major asshole for not letting her kids use my hot spring tub. She let it slip that she poured household vinegar in the stream as ‚Äújustice‚Äù. The neighbor was also shown the contract for the pipes and she said that she didn‚Äôt even have it signed by me. She and her lawyer had signed it, but without any signature space for me. I thought that she forged my signature, but she didn‚Äôt have any agreement (fraudulent or otherwise) on my side whatsoever. The neighbor similarly dislikes her, but their kids are friends, so she has to talk to CN. I sent all the info to a local environmental charity that has contacts within environmental protection agencies. They usually deal with lakes and dumping, so this was in what they deal with regularly. 

The police were outside CN‚Äôs house a couple hours ago and took her to the station. CN is back at her house, now yelling over the fence profanities while I‚Äôm having a coffee. I don‚Äôt know if they arrested her and she payed bail or that she just was taken in for questioning or something. I know her brother in law works at the police station, but I wouldn‚Äôt doubt that her family members have a strained relationship with her. I hope that she‚Äôs stuck with a giant fine and/or jail time. CN‚Äôs lawyer still hasn‚Äôt served me regarding the pipes, and my lawyer is saying that CN has no case whatsoever. I‚Äôll update as soon as anything interesting comes up.

Update 6: My power just went out in most of my house. I think CN just flipped the breakers to annoy me. Going outside ASAP

Update 7: CN indeed did flip the breakers. As far as I know, the security camera has an internal battery for some time after it‚Äôs disconnected from the power so I don‚Äôt have to worry about her doing anything.

Revenge Discussion Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/neighborsfromhell/comments/1kk45k1/updatediscussion_revenge_tactics/

Update 8: I called the owner of the copy/print/delivery shop and he agreed to what I said in the previous post. I removed all of the pipes from my yard and put them into bags. I didn‚Äôt have as much plastic bags and boxes as I thought so I‚Äôm paying extra for the owner of the copy shop to supply them. He just delivered the first one to CN (I watched from the street) and CN‚Äôs husband answered. He shouted for CN and she came up. I didn‚Äôt hear any of the discussion, but she signed delivery sheet, took the package (of a single small corner pipe piece), and stormed into her house. She went up to the 2nd story window and proceeded to glare at me since, still glaring as I sit on my couch while writing this. Working from home will be so nice for watching this.

Update 9: Since my last post, there has been one more pipe delivery to CN and she is pissed. She stormed over to my house (after signing the delivery which I thought she would stop doing) and banged on the door. I started recording my front door and opened the door (I'm not dumb enough to let her in). CN starts shrieking about how I'm awful and that I had to keep the pipes installed as it was her property and that we had a contract. When I told her that the contract wasn't legal at all, she starts screaming at me. I stepped inside for a second and called the police with the door closed. CN continues banging on my door. I don't open until a police car comes down the street.

I tell the police that I don't want her ever to be on my property and that she is tresspassing. They relay that to her, and she takes up a hurt old lady act (for reference, she is in her 40s). CN tells them that my hot tub burned her youngest child and that I was luring kids in. I showed the police the camera footage and they asked her to come to the station with them. I'm assuming that she made some fake report, but I guess that will be another charge of lying to a police officer. I think that the officer (not CN's brother in law) believed me and saw that she was in fact a CN.

I saw CN get back into her house and once again went up to the top window, staring. I closed the blinds. I thought she would stop (honestly it doesn't bother me), but to my surprise, she crosses the street to the side of the hill (theres a slope on the other side of the street from the houses. There's more houses up the slope) and stares through my front window. I don't have blinds for that one and was about to head to a different room when I see her trip backwards (theres a small ditch for runoff) and land on her butt. CN lets out a ungodly shriek (it wasn't that loud, but I'd like to say it was) as she storms back into her house.

I feel at this point, with all of the stuff from my lawyer, from reddit, and neighbors saying that I am completely in the right and that CN is insane has made this more into entertainment than a scary situation for me. I have multiple locks arriving in a couple days and a new security camera for the side yard. If you have any legal suggestions, please tell me. If there's anything I should be aware of, please tell me.

Update 9: I‚Äôve been told that messing with CN is probably not going to help out legally, especially with a restraining order, so I just told the copy shop owner just to deliver it all at once. I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs happened yet, but I‚Äôm fine not being looking when I happens. I will file a restraining order today. I don‚Äôt know how it works, but I hope I can complete it today. No new news from CN except Jay saying that she looked really mad. I know this isn‚Äôt a big update, but it‚Äôs an update on the situation.

Update 10: This happened last night and I was too tired to update after it. CN's husband (I'll call him NH for neighbor husband) knocked on my door last night, alone. CN wasn't there, so I answered it. He then tells me that CN is ""going through some things right now"" and some other stuff. He then asks me if I could ""let sleeping dogs lie. She did some stuff wrong, but she's a really great person"". I told him that I would consider it. I'm not, but I didn't want to be in that conversation. I honestly thought that he would apologize about it, but making excuses like that is so pathetic. According to many of my neighbors, CN's been like this for years. I think he's trying to cover themselves from the bomb they just planted. That's all. New updates probably coming soon.",12,1747194497.0,entitledparents,3,0.88,False

1km5psd,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1km5psd/the_bodies_scream_when_we_brought_them_back/,The bodies scream when we brought them back,"Each time we brought the recently deceased back from the dead, they screamed. We didn‚Äôt know why. The studies and preparation made sense in theory, and yet‚Äîthey screamed. Every time we injected the serum into a cadaver, it would awaken violently, thrashing if it hadn‚Äôt been strapped down, and scream until it expired.

I worked at a facility‚Äîone that specialised in the study of prolonged longevity, death, and the possible resurrection of dead tissue. We had developed a new compound that appeared capable of repairing and regenerating damaged cells back to full vitality. All our tests on animals showed miraculous results: lifespans extended by years, and in several cases, subjects were brought back from recent death. One rabbit, who came to us at the age of twelve, lived for another ten years within the lab.

Once we were satisfied with the results, we began discussing human testing. Before moving on to live subjects, we wanted to see if we could bring back the recently deceased. We submitted the necessary requests for cadavers and, after navigating a mess of paperwork and red tape, established a steady stream of bodies kept on ice. The individuals sent to us had died from known diseases and had been marked for scientific use. We tried to ensure that the brain had not fully degraded, so we required the bodies to be no more than a few days‚Äîat most, a week‚Äîpost-mortem.

The first test was catastrophic.

Generally, when we applied the serum to animals, the body would convulse slightly and, as if waking from sleep, the creature would open its eyes and look at us. One dog we tested even wagged its tail in excitement at the sight of us. But for the first human subject, excitement was the last thing on its mind.

We laid the male subject out on a table, modesty underwear placed on them for decency. Once prepared, we injected the compound at the base of the skull and waited‚Äîusually thirty seconds to a minute‚Äîfor the serum to begin rebuilding neural tissue. Our theory suggested we‚Äôd awaken a conscious person, albeit brain-dead. Our hope was to see them fully restored.

Both were wrong.

The subject tensed its entire body before a wave of movement flowed from the neck, down the arms, and through to the feet‚Äîas if, in one smooth motion, the ‚Äòsoul‚Äô had slid back into its flesh. The hands gripped the sides of the table, the head twitched, every muscle fibre firing in chaotic, distorted spasms. His heartbeat began to pulse on our equipment, sending freshly created blood through the body. We watched in stunned amazement as the body took a long, deep breath. We smiled at the results, we did it.

Suddenly it lurched forward‚Äîits upper half snapping upright like a sprung trap. Its face contorted, mouth gaping wide, eyes bulging from their sockets, nostrils flared.

Then the screaming began.

It was a distorted scream‚Äînot unearthly, though it could be described as such. But that was only because the sound destroyed its own vocal cords and oesophagus under the sheer strain of what it was trying to emit. It was the sound of an animal, fighting with every fibre of its being to escape. The scream filled the small room, reverberating through the glassware, tearing through me‚Äîand likely everyone present.

It peaked as the body began to shake violently, its hands clawing at its own flesh, as if something unseen had gripped it from the inside. The legs trembled with frenetic energy, as if they were desperate to run, before twisting violently to one side. A sickening crack signalled the snapping of the hip.

The body collapsed, falling from the table, its head striking the cold floor with a wet smack. The screaming dragged on for another five frail seconds, then stopped with a final, broken whimper. Revitalised blood began to pool from the fractured skull, the leg bent at an unnatural angle. The noise that had escaped from that corpse felt like something being burned alive‚Äîor torn apart. Not that I know what those things sound like‚Ä¶ but I imagine that would be the closest approximation.

I wanted to end the tests there and then. But the others insisted‚Äîwe‚Äôd had a breakthrough, and we had to see it completed.

With the second subject, we took no risks. He was strapped tightly to the bench before we began. Another male, mid-forties, dead from a heart attack. My own body tensed in anticipation of what was to come. The injection was administered and, much like the first, the body responded with small, twitching bursts of energy before the spasms began. Bound at the limbs and forehead, its movements were restricted‚Äîbut not silenced.

No amount of hearing protection could shield us from the guttural growls and screams that forced their way out of the subject‚Äôs throat. The entire table rattled beneath him, restraints tightening and tearing deep into the flesh as freshly reanimated blood began to leak from the wounds. Between each shriek and convulsion, the mouth snapped open and shut violently until the tongue was chewed and torn apart. The subject choked on his own blood less than a minute after revival.

We had been instructed to intervene only if the subject could be reasonably calmed. If they expired again, the company would simply supply more bodies‚Äîand more funding.

It didn‚Äôt matter‚Äîthe sex, the race, the build, the age, the health before death, or how they died.

They all came back screaming.

After staggering through weeks of what could only be described as unholy experiments, we began testing different methods to sedate and prolong the bodies post-reanimation. One attempt stood out‚Äîwe purposely severed the vocal cords of a cadaver before revival, hoping to silence the inevitable screaming.

She was a woman, middle-aged, and already pale from death. When she awoke, there were tears already welling in her eyes, as if her mind remembered something her body hadn‚Äôt yet caught up with. Her breathing came fast and shallow, accelerating into panicked, rasping sobs‚Äîwet, desperate gulps of air like someone drowning in the open.

Though she couldn‚Äôt scream, the sounds she made were worse. Muffled cries slipped from her ruined throat, each one a garbled echo of agony that sent shivers through every person in the room. The moans of pain‚Äîof disbelief. Grief. Recognition.

Her eyes darted wildly, bloodshot and filled with terror, locking onto each of us in turn as if begging for help or mercy‚Äîperhaps both. She tried to lift her arms, but the restraints held her down. Instead, she writhed, shuddering uncontrollably, her body convulsing in silent torment. The tears flowed freely now, tracking down her cheeks in trembling rivulets.

We had silenced her voice, but we hadn‚Äôt silenced the pain. If anything, it made it worse‚Äîwatching her suffer without the outlet to scream. The room was filled with the sound of breath and whimpers, and something else: a low, involuntary whine that came not from her, but from one of the assistants, curled slightly in the corner, unable to look.

We disposed of the subject humanely.

The effect on the staff was undeniable. Conversations shortened, small talk faded, and laughter disappeared entirely. The jokes we once shared over coffee about playing God felt horrific, even dangerous to say aloud. Soon, silence became our default. We spoke only when necessary, and only about work. Every day we showed up, ran the tests, documented the results, and went home. No one asked questions.

The sense of camaraderie we‚Äôd built during the animal trials dissolved. The feeling of triumph, of being on the cusp of something extraordinary, turned to quiet dread. The resignations came quietly, one by one. No formal farewells, just an empty desk the next morning. Their replacements arrived with wide eyes and excitement, but that never lasted long.

Due to the confidentiality clauses in our contracts, I wasn‚Äôt allowed to contact any of them after they left. I never found out what happened to most of them. But I do remember one clearly. James. A close friend of mine. He was quiet in his final weeks at work‚Äîbarely spoke, barely ate. Then one day, he didn‚Äôt come in. Then I saw the news. He had jumped from the top of his apartment building.

I thought about quitting. I really did. But the raise they gave me was too good to leave.

Our results were yielding nothing. Every subject we brought back either screamed, wailed, or violently thrashed before eventually expiring‚Äîor being put down.

With permissions, we began to explore the unconventional. We dabbled in pseudoscience and religious dogmata, anything that might offer an answer science could not.

The people we brought in were paid obscene amounts and sworn to absolute secrecy. Toward the end, even threats were issued. One hypnotist‚Äîan odd woman with steady hands and tired eyes‚Äîwas brought in to help calm the subjects. Her role was to attempt to induce a calm state as we gradually reanimated, stimulating isolated regions of the brain one at a time while keeping the rest dormant.

For a while, it seemed promising. We ran countless sessions, and on one occasion, after several attempts and enough sedatives to drop an elephant, a subject stirred gently under hypnosis.

There was a breath‚Äîa shallow, ragged gasp of pained air squeezed through clenched teeth.

Then a single word.

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

It was faint. Barely audible. A tremble of soul-deep confusion and grief.

And then, the screaming returned‚Äîmore feral and violent than before. The subject convulsed so hard the restraints tore deep into the flesh. The hypnotist never returned after that session. She didn‚Äôt even collect her final pay.

After her, we were truly desperate. We brought in a priest‚Äîan ageing man with a cautious demeanour‚Äîwilling to participate in hopes of finding some sort of answer. None of us were superstitious, but something in the screaming had begun to strip away our rationality, our sense of detachment. It felt as though each reanimation peeled back another layer of our humanity, leaving something hollow and shaking beneath.

The priest performed a full exorcism over the cadaver as it reanimated. He held a crucifix above its chest and muttered Latin gospels with trembling conviction. Strangely, the body responded. It strained violently against the restraints, muscles taut as steel cords, but it didn‚Äôt scream. Not at first.

The priest‚Äôs words seemed to still it‚Äîbut only for a moment. Then the corpse snapped upright with terrifying force, tearing free of the table as metal bolts ripped from the floor. It lunged, flailing wildly. The priest stumbled back, narrowly avoiding a crushing blow to the head, and managed to escape with no significant injury.

What followed was not panic, but fury. He shouted at us, eyes wild, accusing us of blasphemy. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre dragging sinners from hell,‚Äù he screamed. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre summoning torment, not salvation!‚Äù His voice cracked as he ranted and raved, his tone eerily echoing the corpses we‚Äôd brought back. Then he left‚Äîstormed out of the facility, never to return.

From that point on, armed guards were stationed in every session. Not that it mattered. The sessions didn‚Äôt last long after that anyway.

For one final try, one more attempt to gain any understanding, we turned away from the mystical and into even more eccentric science. We selected an elderly subject‚Äîlate 90s, died of natural causes. A quiet death, with no visible trauma. We surgically detached his spinal column from the base of the brain, severing all motor function. The body was essentially quadraplegic, incapable of movement or speech. Only the essential organ connections were maintained.

Then, we installed a neural interface‚Äîan experimental chip connected directly to the brainstem and visual cortex, linked to a computer in the adjacent observation room. It was programmed to interpret neural signals and convert them into written text.

Only a few of us remained by this point. We sat in silence behind the thick glass, monitors glowing faintly in the dim observation room. The only other person present inside the subjects room was the armed guard, now a permanent fixture, with orders to terminate the subject immediately if necessary.

We administered the injection and waited.

There were no spasms, no strained limbs, no hideous sounds of vocal cords tearing. Just the soft, rhythmic beep of a heart restarting and the subtle rise and fall of a chest drawing breath. The room was so silent, it felt as though the screams of the previous cadavers echoed from memory into the still air.

Then the text flashed on screen:

‚ÄòWhere am I?‚Äô

We froze.

Even though it was only text, something in my mind gave it life. I heard the voice behind it. An old man. Tired. Confused.

We typed back.

‚ÄòWho are you?‚Äô

‚ÄòJohn Forrester. Who are you?‚Äô

‚ÄòWe‚Äôre here to help, John. How old are you?‚Äô

‚ÄòNinety-six. Who are you?‚Äô

The information matched. We were finally getting somewhere.

Then the next message appeared:

‚ÄòAre you him?‚Äô

We paused.

‚ÄòWho?‚Äô

There was a long silence.

Then:

‚ÄòYou‚Äôre not him. No, no no.‚Äô

John‚Äôs heart rate began to climb. The breathing grew rapid. His test flashed again.

‚ÄòYou‚Äôre not supposed to know.‚Äô

We stared at the screen, unsure how to respond. My assistant looked at me, her mouth slightly open, but I said nothing.

‚ÄòYou‚Äôre not supposed to know.‚Äô He repeated.

I looked through the window.

John‚Äôs eyes were open.

Wide. Wet. Unblinking.

Tears streamed down his cheeks, pooling on the slab beneath. It shouldn‚Äôt have been possible.

‚ÄòHe won‚Äôt let me back. You‚Äôre not supposed to know.‚Äô

The cursor blinked.

I turned to the screen again, only to see another message.

‚ÄòHe won‚Äôt let you.‚Äô

Pause.

‚ÄòHe won‚Äôt let you.‚Äô

Again.

And again.

And again.

My heart thudded painfully in my chest, matching the BPM displayed on the monitor. My breathing grew shallow. Then I heard something.

Not in my mind.

Real sound.

I looked up.

John‚Äôs mouth was moving.

Impossible. His nerves were severed.

His lips parted wider. Sound emerged‚Äîquiet at first, but real. Tangible.

‚ÄúHe won‚Äôt let you‚Ä¶‚Äù

I froze. I shouldn‚Äôt be able to hear it through the glass but I heard it. The guard looked to me for the termination signal.

I shook my head. Not yet.

‚ÄúHe won‚Äôt let you‚Ä¶‚Äù

The whisper grew in volume, ragged and forced from a throat that should‚Äôve been silent.

‚ÄúHe won‚Äôt let you! He won‚Äôt let you! He won‚Äôt let you! He won‚Äôt let you! He won‚Äôt let you! HE WON‚ÄôT LET YOU!‚Äù

The gunshot was final.

Absolute.

The sound rang out across the lab like a gavel striking the lid of a coffin. John‚Äôs body slumped against the slab, what remained of his expression frozen in wide-eyed agony. The guard, shaking, holstered his weapon and left the room without a word.

The silence that followed was suffocating.

I collapsed back into my chair. My ears rang, not from the shot‚Äîbut from the absence of everything else. No monitors, no voices, no screams.

Just silence.

I didn‚Äôt know what to report. I didn‚Äôt know what I just witnessed.

The project was terminated soon after, officially deemed a dead end. We were compensated generously‚Äîbonuses, severance, hush clauses buried in legalese. More than enough to vanish, to start over, to never work again.

But money does nothing for the silence.

I sit here now, alone, typing these words. Surrounded by a silence so heavy it feels alive. Suffocating. Endless. To fill that silence, my mind conjures John‚Äôs voice, Lingering on his words.

I now wish for the screaming instead.

1km5ggw,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComfyChairs/comments/1km5ggw/are_chaise_lounges_considered_chairs/,Are chaise lounges considered chairs?,"Lena had been working from home for nearly a year when she decided her little reading nook needed an upgrade. Her back had started to protest the rigid dining chair she‚Äôd been using, and she longed for something more relaxing‚Äîa spot where she could work in the mornings and unwind with a book in the afternoons. After hours of scrolling through interior design blogs, Pinterest boards, and online reviews, she came across a gorgeous velvet chaise lounge in deep navy blue. It had an elegant curve, one raised side, and a tufted seat that looked like it belonged in a boutique hotel.

The description online labeled it as a ‚Äúchaise lounge chair,‚Äù which got her wondering‚Äîwas it actually a chair? She‚Äôd never really thought about how furniture was categorized before, but now it mattered. If she was replacing her chair, shouldn‚Äôt she be sure?

Lena took her curiosity to Reddit, specifically to the r/furniture and r/InteriorDesign subreddits. She posted a simple question: *‚ÄúIs a chaise lounge technically considered a chair?‚Äù* The replies came in fast.

One user, who claimed to be a furniture designer, wrote that a chaise lounge is indeed a type of chair‚Äîmore specifically, a type of reclining chair. It originated from the French term ‚Äúchaise longue,‚Äù which means ‚Äúlong chair.‚Äù Another person chimed in to explain that in the world of furniture taxonomy, a chair is typically defined as a piece with a seat, back, and possibly arms, made for one person. Since a chaise lounge is designed for one person to recline comfortably, it still qualifies, even if its form stretches the traditional image of a chair.

Someone else shared a personal anecdote about using a chaise lounge as their desk chair during the pandemic. They added a lap desk and a small cushion for lumbar support and found it incredibly comfortable. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a chair with flair,‚Äù they joked.

Lena laughed reading that, but she still wanted to be sure before buying. She reached out to the company selling the chaise and asked them directly. The rep confirmed that while the piece was categorized under accent furniture, it was indeed considered a type of chair‚Äîa lounge chair, to be exact.

Feeling confident now, Lena ordered the chaise. When it arrived, she set it up near the window, threw a knit blanket over one end, and added a side table for her coffee and books. It became her favorite spot in the apartment. She used it for morning Zoom calls, mid-afternoon reading breaks, and even occasional naps.

Her takeaway? Yes, a chaise lounge is a chair‚Äîjust a more relaxed and elegant one. And for her, it was the perfect blend of function and comfort.",1,1747193282.0,ComfyChairs,0,1.0,False

‚Ä¢ Best shifts: No such thing. Well over 1L students write this exam. People on this subreddit use anecdotal and subjective evidence to draw conclusions like ""shift x was better than y"". It is extremely difficult to know which shift was harder this way. And that is assuming one shift was appreciably harder than the others. The BITSAT question paper is randomly generated by pulling questions from a large question bank. The exam committee ensures comparable difficulty of different shifts. If you don't trust them regarding this, then you can't trust them about anything for this exam. Please pick the date that is convenient for you. People here will mislead you into choosing a certain date, so that the seats for the date they want are left for them. ""You all should pick X so that I can easily grab Y"".

‚Ä¢ Bonus questions: 12 bonus Q. Distribution: 3x Phys, 3x Chem, 3x Math/Bio, 3x LR. No questions from English here. Question difficulty is generally said to be the same as the normal 130 Q.

‚Ä¢ Syllabus: It goes even beyond the JEE Advanced syllabus. Everything from the old NCERT and beyond is asked. Not JEE Mains. Not rationalized NCERT. Questions from the deleted NCERT syllabus were asked last year.

‚Ä¢ Improvement exam: You can write improvement exams for a single or multiple subjects. Only the latest performance is considered. But, your results must be available before 30th June. Students graduating 12th this year, or the previous year (single year droppers) can write BITSAT. No double droppers.

‚Ä¢ General advice: The duration per question is low. Use mocks to get your speed and rhythm right. Cover every nook and cranny of every chapter. 5 questions from LPP in a shift, the structure of coffee, colour of some insects blood (chem question, not bio), which type of wave causes tsunamis (Phys question), or almost no questions from organic chemistry for some shifts. These are things that have happened previously.

1km5crm,https://www.reddit.com/r/EstrangedAdultChild/comments/1km5crm/pregnant_and_estranged_from_my_ill_alcoholic/,"Pregnant and estranged from my ill, alcoholic father. The guilt is strong sometimes","I (32F) went no contact with my father almost two years ago. He‚Äôs an alcoholic, left home and split up from my mom when I was around 9 and moved to another state, so my two brothers and I stopped seeing him very often. My brothers and I talked to him on the phone almost every Sunday and we‚Äôd sometimes visit him over the summer. Every time we‚Äôd visit, though, he‚Äôd drink and smoke pot nonstop in front of me and my younger brother, even if he was driving. He also constantly flirted with every woman around us, which made me really uncomfortable.

He‚Äôd send my mom some money for us (not a lot) and whenever he‚Äôd come visit he‚Äôd buy us clothes and books, which was nice, I guess. He was never abusive to me or my brothers, but now that I‚Äôm an adult I can tell that he was mentally abusive to my mother, cheating on her, calling her fat, etc. 

For some reason I was always my father‚Äôs favorite child, and when I became an adult I could tell that he had a strong preference for me over my two brothers. He thinks we have a special connection or something just because I did my BA in literature and he teaches philosophy at college. I don‚Äôt feel connected to him though, like at all. He doesn‚Äôt feel like a father to me, never has. I have zero memories of him taking care of me or making sure I felt happy, safe and protected. I remember feeling his hands long and boney and cold every time he hugged me. It makes me cringe. 

He never abused me or anything, but I do remember him making comments that made me really uncomfortable when I was younger, like one time he took me shopping, saw me try something on and said ‚Äúif only you weren‚Äôt my daughter‚Ä¶‚Äù and a few other comments that made me feel really gross. 

When I was in my late teens he got very sick and had to get heart surgery. He tried to quit drinking and smoking after that (both joints and regular cigarettes) but it didn‚Äôt last, and soon he was drinking one glass after another every single day. He always finds a million ways of justifying his drinking and smoking and refuses to admit he has a problem, even though it‚Äôs evident to everyone else. Every time we went out to eat together he‚Äôd start his meal with 3-4 beers, followed by a tequila shot, followed by two whiskeys with his coffee. He‚Äôd drink one beer after another at home on a daily basis and he finished every evening with red wine. 

Moving on. Between 2016 and 2018 I hit rock bottom with my eating disorder and it was a very stressful time for me, my mom and my brothers. All of them were there for me while I went through treatment, but my father wasn‚Äôt around for that either. Not even on the phone. I‚Äôm not sure he was even aware of the severity of the problem and how his abandonment and all the nasty comments he made regarding my mom‚Äôs weight contributed to me getting sick. 

Couple years after that and one I got better, I moved to another country, and when Covid hit he started calling me very often while he was drunk and he‚Äôd drunkenly talk about philosophy because, for some reason, he thinks we ‚Äúconnect‚Äù through that. He has never ever worried about my actual wellbeing, so every single time he‚Äôd call I just had to listen to him be drunk and rant and talk about existential things and he never ever asked how I was doing. He‚Äôd make me extremely worried because he was so alone there, and I could hear how wasted he was and I had no idea if he was going to die in his sleep that night and I had nobody to reach out to so they‚Äôd keep an eye on him because all of his friends are his young students who don‚Äôt give a fuck about him and only hang out with him because he pays for their drinks. Those days I remember obsessively checking the last time he had been online on WhatsApp to try to find out if he was still alive.

One of those times he called me he told me he wanted to kill himself and that really broke me. My anxiety went through the roof and I had no idea how to help him so I went back to therapy to try to learn how to cope with my feelings.

Around that time I went back home and we tried spending the holidays together, my brothers, our partners, my mom and my dad (as coparents) and I. He kept drinking and asking for more drinks and made us all really uncomfortable. 

I am well aware that alcoholism is a serious illness and that overcoming it is not a matter of willpower. However, as someone who also struggled with mental illness (my ED) and managed to ask for help and get it and eventually got better, I am very resentful about him not even wanting to change. Like he even refuses to admit he has a problem. 

The last straw for me was when my mom had to go through a very serious surgery. My brother and I paid for it, and my father said he‚Äôd get us a reimbursement through his insurance (my parents are still legally married even though they broke up when my dad first left) and when they reimbursed him he kept the money.

I decided to go no contact after that. My brothers and mother think I should be forgiving, but they respect my decision. I‚Äôve felt so free ever since. I don‚Äôt feel that horrible anxiety I felt every time I saw him calling me, or that dread of wondering how long he‚Äôd live for after we hung up the phone. 

The last time I went home for the holidays I accidentally overheard my mom talking to him on the phone. Through fragmented conversations and a cryptic post my mom made on Facebook, I can tell he needs heart surgery again and he has been borrowing money from my mom and brothers.

I‚Äôve been feeling so horribly guilty for not reaching out to him to see how he‚Äôs doing, but I‚Äôm 36 weeks pregnant, worked so hard on achieving the peace I finally feel and I don‚Äôt want to feel anxious, sad and worried about him while taking care of my baby.  

I know he‚Äôs old, alone, and sick, but I don‚Äôt want to talk to him. I don‚Äôt think he loves any of us. He just takes and takes and takes. 

I feel like the shittiest person in the world writing this, but I‚Äôm so pissed he‚Äôs making my family go through this because of his bad decisions. 

I know I don‚Äôt have as many reasons as other people here to cut him off and go no contact. But I‚Äôm really angry I didn‚Äôt get to have a normal father that would love me, protect me and take care of me as I needed to be loved and protected, and not in his own terms. It sounds so selfish when I write it, but it is what it is. 

Anyway. I just needed to vent. My baby is due soon and I can‚Äôt afford my therapy sessions anymore so Reddit it is. Thanks for reading.

I posted several questions in the subreddit regarding my fear of heights and landslides. I'm happy to report I was able to finish the trek but I did crap my pants a few times lol. Right out of the gate on day one there is a huge landslide that must be traversed on the way to the campsite in Soraypampa. They cut a trail into the landslide, I would say it was about a hundred yards long or more and probably about four feet wide roughly. Quite frankly I'm surprised I made it across. A couple feet of the trail was washed out in two different places where they put boards down for you to walk across. Anyways this was by far the scariest part of the trek for me. On day two we started hiking up to Humantay Lake which was beautiful. It was actually pretty interesting while we were up there taking pictures clouds rolled in practically instantaneously and we couldn't see other hikers in our group standing 50 feet away. Never seen anything quite like that. We headed back down to the Salkantay trail and proceeded to hike up to the pass. It rained most of the time but it was pretty light. When we arrived at the pass we couldn't see squat but it is what it is. We started our descent to a campsite in Wayracmachay which sucked. The entire site was basically a mud hole but I digress. The next day we started our hike to the Loreta Hobbit houses. This was a very long day. It's important to note most of the day was spent hiking on the porter road on the east side of the Salkantay River. On the west side of the river is the actual Trail but it is completely fubar due to the land slides. People may or may not be hiking on the trail instead of the porter road but in my opinion you would need to have balls of steel to do this. As the matter of fact just the night before there were two landslides on the porter road that we needed to be traversed which for me was pretty rough but the guides in my group were instrumental in getting my chicken shit ass across them. These mountains are the real deal. They're steep and high and seem to be constantly changing. Quite frankly I don't know how people don't die here on a weekly basis. The following day we hike to Llactapata tent site. From here you catch your first view of Machu Picchu. This was by far my favorite day. We climbed about 2,500 ft through the forest on the Inca Trail to get to where we were going stopping along the way to learn how coffee is made which was wicked cool. Parts of this track was basically a jungle. It was amazing, very cool. The day I just completed today was hiking from the tent sites down to the hydroelectric dam and then spent several hours hiking down the train tracks to get to AC where I am now. Tomorrow I hike Machu Picchu. We did this Trek with Alpaca expeditions. I absolutely love the guides and the food. The menu was varied and delicious. These chefs deserve some sort of award. As for everything else I have quite a bit to say, not so many good things to say but I'll save that for a review in a different post. Anyways in addition to Machu Picchu tomorrow I am also hiking Huayana Picchu. This will be my final test of my fear of heights, wish me luck.

Alright, friends! Let‚Äôs get real for a second. If you could wave a magic wand and automate *one* thing in your life‚Äîjust one‚Äîwhat would it be? I mean, think about it! What‚Äôs that one task that steals your time, energy, or sanity but could totally be handled by a robot or an app?

For me, it‚Äôs definitely my *meal prep*. Imagine waking up to pre-cooked, perfectly portioned meals just sitting there, waiting for you like little delicious gifts from the universe! **Why am I spending an hour chopping veggies when a sweet robot could do it in seconds?**

Here are a few ideas I came up with that might resonate:

- **Grocery Shopping**: Ever been standing in a store, overwhelmed by choices? Automate your shopping list, and let an app remind you of your go-to items. Boom‚Äîless time spent, more brain space freed!
  
- **Exercise Reminders**: If only someone (or something) could just *shout* at us when it‚Äôs time to get off the couch! Imagine an automated nudge that actually makes you jump and move. Maybe I need to invent a robotic alarm that throws a pillow at me when it‚Äôs workout time‚Ä¶ thoughts?

- **Calendar Management**: Oh, the endless game of balancing meetings, appointments, and personal time. Some kind of AI assistant that would say, ‚ÄúHey, Sarah, you need a break‚Äîhow about a coffee date with your couch?‚Äù Yes, please!

- **Daily Affirmations**: What if you could wake up to a voice (maybe Morgan Freeman‚Äôs?) telling you how awesome you are? ‚ÄúToday is your day, champ! You got this!‚Äù Talk about starting the day on the right foot!

Now, before you think I‚Äôve lost it, humor me! Automating a few of these tasks frees up time for what matters most: **creativity, connection, and those spontaneous Netflix binge nights!** üòÇ

But let‚Äôs get deep for a moment. What‚Äôs the emotional weight around those tasks for you? Is it about time management, stress reduction, or simply finding a bit more joy in your daily grind? It‚Äôs so fascinating to think about how much we could elevate our lives.

So, if you had to choose *one* thing to automate for peak performance‚Äîwhat would it be? No pressure, just a little nugget to ponder. Let‚Äôs share our best ideas and inspire each other to work a bit smarter, not harder! ‚ú®",1,1747192372.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False
1km561g,https://i.redd.it/kly58qotzn0f1.jpeg,Three more root beers from Utah.,"Thanks to our high population of Mormons, who will not touch coffee or alcohol, I've often thought that Utah is the root beer capital of the United States. I don't have any statistics to back up that assertion, but it sure feels that way out here. Anyway, here are three local brews that I sampled this week, you may be familiar with them or maybe not. 

Sodabrews gets some relatively wide distribution from the Rockies to the Pacific coast and they are known for their apple beer and ginger beer. Their product is pretty good, quite decent, like a high B+. Not particularly skewed in any one direction, but nicely balanced and very quaffable. I would drink it anytime it was offered to me.

Gygi is a large restaurant supply house in Salt Lake City specializing in syrups, elixirs, chocolates, bakery supplies Etc.  They sell a wide line of snow cone syrups, perhaps 20 flavors or more, including the legendary Rocky Mountain unique flavor of Ironport. All their syrups can be consumed as sodas just by mixing the right ratio with carbonated water.  I love their ironport so I decided to try their root beer, which at $19 a gallon will make 6 gallons of root beer in my SodaStream. Their root beer is fine, a very pleasant consumer oriented blend that features vanilla and caramel as it's most forward flavors but just a hint of cinnamon as well.  I rank this up there with the best of the store brands, which places it well ahead of most of the crappy unbalanced craft root beers that I have sampled. I will undoubtedly finish all six gallons of this and who knows I may go back for more but I also bought enough ironport for 12 gallons so it may be a while.

In last place we have Brigham's Brew made by the Wasatch Brewery, which is known for its good Utah beer. I had heard almost Universal bad reviews of Brigham's Brew recently and it been over a decade since I tried it so I decide to revisit it. Yeah it's really nothing special. It's profile is surprisingly bland, with very little flavor of any kind and what small bursts of flavor I did find were medicinal.  No need to ever revisit this one.",2,1747192330.0,rootbeer,0,1.0,False
1km55ay,https://www.reddit.com/r/recoverywithoutAA/comments/1km55ay/general_thoughts_approaching_one_year_sober/,general thoughts approaching one year sober,"not giving advice here. all of this is subjective to my experience.

sober times not that important if youre doing well and happy today. i had 3.5 years, tried being california sober for 3 months, went insane, and then stopped again. went back to aa for several months and got extremely sick of it and left again. of course i get shamed for having problems with aa ""this is exactly what you were saying before you relapsed"" that really fucking bugs me. makes me want to not even talk to aa people about how i really feel anymore. they just guilt trip you with your last relapse being the result of not thinking about it like they do. 

to be honest there were some elements of aa that were useful to me for a few years. i was around sober people. i didnt have directly as many bad experiences as many people write about(aside from having a sponsee that was the most disturbed human ive ever met) 

practically speaking, going to a meeting regularly and making the coffee was what i needed for a while. saying hi to people. looking back i treated it as kind of a sober social club. when i realized it wasnt that i moved on.

not to sound like a 12 stepper, hear me out, but i believe there are people that can benefit from people around certain meetings and maybe even elements of aa and be fine well adjusted sober people i know many such cases who aa is a part of their balanced life.

right now where im at, i am happy doing a variety of things. experimental filmmaking on 16mm film, making art, photography, having a band and writing original music and playing those songs live, doing graphic design work. things i find fulfilling. living out my dreams.

one guy who was a worse case than me runs ultramarathons now and is 4 years sober without ANY aa, it took him a few tries a few relapses. im just saying have a hobby and an identity that isnt just ""addict"" or ""alcoholic"" is immensely helpful to my sobriety.

i dont do aa anymore. its not really something i cling to for support. i just live my life.

i got to the point where i just dont want to use anymore. i got sick of the fearmongering and i realized i didnt agree with the 12 step ideology, it feels like it doesnt line up with my experience.

i consider myself in recovery from drug addiction. im just sober. so i dont drink or do any drugs. 

i have a variety of serious mental health issues that come out after just one or two beers. if i smoke any amount of weed my mind gets into a scary place and i dont want to stop. i tried being california sober and i was immediately as insane as i was four years earlier

an example is say a ricola cough drop. i can really set out to not chew on a cough drop crushing it with my teeth but every time i just do it automatically. i try every time i have one but same thing with drugs when i start at all i cannot stop. im not quitting cough drops its just an analogy.

so yeah if you cant stop using and truly want to i think you can get sober doing anything

im not familiar with the freedom model sounds like it works for a lot of people, to be honest im not sure telling a person whos smoking 30 fentanyl pressed percs every day that they can just learn to moderate their use is a good idea, idk. i guess some people can smoke weed and not do heroin  thats awesome, but i see why people get hesitant to promote that.

anyways while aa is a part of some peoples path, im much happier being sober without it. it was good having somewhere to go or somewhere to be for a bit but i really dont vibe with aa.

Is this a me issue I need to solve?,"I, 15F, am in a new foster home. My foster dad has celiacs disease, but they have said I am allowed to have gluten stuff if I keep it separate from them, which I do. 
      I already struggle with male figures so I understand why I am so awkward around my foster dad, who I will call N. N is definitely what you would call weird, and to be honest it makes me uncomfortable. This is also most likely because of my past which I will not get into. He doesn‚Äôt do anything predatory or whatever, it just makes me uncomfortable. 
      
      He asks A LOT of questions. I have told him on multiple occasions how his questions stress me out but his response is ‚ÄúWell how am I supposed to find out about your day?‚Äù ???? By not asking questions???? I understand I need to tell him ‚ÄúJust dont ask questions as much please, if you stop bombarding me with questions I will feel more comfortable drama dumping at the end of the day‚Äù and I will soon. 
      
      But onto what is really bothering me, today my foster mom was making cookies and had started putting them on the tray, so I grabbed a piece of (clean) wrapping from something she just used onto one of the cookies because I did not think it would bother them. I also did not touch the cookie with my hand, and the part of the plastic I touched made no contact with the cookie either. It was also wrapping from a gluten free item so no gluten on that either. I then sit down and then I hear her say ‚ÄúOh now I need to throw this away since your gluten hands touched it‚Äù when they didn‚Äôt? so I told her they did not touch the cookies, only the outside of the wrapper. She then says ‚Äúwell the wrapper touched the cookie so it‚Äôs contaminated‚Äù I did not get this but I thought it was wasteful, but she ended up eating the cookie dough glob so it‚Äôs whatever. 

      Then it turned into a whole big conversation about how I don‚Äôt understand how allergic N is to gluten, so they explained, so I understand now. 

      What is bugging me though, is N told me he gets mini panic attacks whenever I eat gluten‚Ä¶ what the fuck? No he doesn‚Äôt? if he does then he just controls his breathing extremely well, is fine with coming up to me and striking up a conversation while I am eating something with gluten, is fine with being near me while I eat gluten, and usually he doesnt even pay attention to me while I eat. Mini fucking panic attacks? Every time I eat gluten? When he was the one that allowed me to eat gluten near him? 

      He also babies me. He says its not babying me, but its how I feel it is. He doesnt want me watching anything even slightly violent or playing games with even any slight amount of gore, and gets uncomfortable when I make a dark humor joke near him (So I dont really make jokes near him anymore because I dont want to deal with another ‚ÄúYou think thats funny? thats not funny‚Ä¶ thats a real/serious issue. That isnt funny.‚Äù conversation. I don‚Äôt even want to find a show near him anymore, because one time I added the diddy documentary to my watch later list and he asked why I was so interested in watching child torture and looked at me like I was planning on killing him. He also told my foster mom it made him feel uncomfortable because I was killing all the males in sims. I sent one ghost to the afterlife who was a dude. ONE. 

      He is also extremely dirty, and he told me he understood my trauma because he grew up rich and always got everything he wanted‚Ä¶ this was in response later on to me telling them about how poor I grew up and how I had like stress with money and how my growing up with no money and barely any food made me kind of feel like I had to spend all the money I got at that moment, because who knew if it would get taken from me or when I would get more. So thanks for that, N. 

      He doesn‚Äôt pick up after himself. He leaves his plates or dishes on the counter and if he spills coffee he just‚Ä¶ leaves it? Ew. 

      We also live in apartments, and as of right now our dishwasher is broken (it doesn‚Äôt heat up) and so our dishes are never fully clean‚Ä¶ most times they still have food chunks on them. He thinks it‚Äôs fine and sanitary to just rinse them in cold water and put them away, so practically all the dishes are dirty and they are both fine with that, it doesn‚Äôt bother them. 

      He is also an extreme like feminist or something, I‚Äôm not sure. he constantly apologizes for ‚Äòmansplaining‚Äô (He wasn‚Äôt, he was literally just explaining something) and that other guys only and always mansplain. He also thinks men suck. Like? Ok??? Are you embarrassed of being a man? Because thats how he acts. Thanks for thinking we should be equal but shut the fuck up with the ‚ÄúOh i‚Äôm sorry for mansplaining‚Ä¶ Oh guys can never do anything they are just incompetent‚Ä¶. Guys are horrible‚Ä¶‚Äù blah blah blah. Shut up. 

      I understand this could also just be me being a bitchy teenager with male trauma. If I need a reality check please do so in the replies haha

The Ultimate Oolong Tea Caffeine Guide,"We all know that drinking oolong tea offers many benefits, but some people worry about consuming too much caffeine. Does oolong tea contain caffeine? How much is there? Are there ways to reduce the caffeine content without compromising its flavor? Let\`s learn about oolong tea.

# [How Much Caffeine Does Oolong Tea have?](https://dofotea.com/blogs/news/the-ultimate-oolong-tea-caffeine-guide)

Oolong tea does contain caffeine, with its levels varying based on several factors, including the specific type of oolong, the brewing time, and the water temperature.

>

# Understanding Caffeine Levels in Oolong Teas

# What is the caffeine content in an 8oz cup of oolong tea?

An 8-ounce cup of oolong tea typically contains between¬†**28 to 42 milligrams**¬†of caffeine.

The exact amount can vary widely depending on the specific type of oolong tea and its brewing conditions.

# Daily Intake Recommendations



[The European Food Safety Authority recommends](https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/topics/topic/caffeine)¬†a maximum daily caffeine intake of¬†**400 mg**, which translates to about¬†**6 cups of oolong tea (250 ml each)**for most individuals without adverse effects

# What Is the Exact Caffeine Content in Oolong Tea?

The exact caffeine content in oolong tea can vary based on factors like the specific variety of oolong, how it's processed, and how long it's steeped.

However, here are general ranges for the caffeine content in a standard 8 oz (240 ml) cup of oolong tea:

* **Lightly oxidized oolong tea**: 20-40 mg of caffeine per cup
* **Moderately oxidized oolong tea**: 40-50 mg of caffeine per cup
* **Heavily oxidized oolong tea**: 50-55 mg of caffeine per cup

# What are the caffeine levels of different oolong tea varietiesÔºü

Different oolong varieties have different caffeine levels.

|**Tea Type**|**Caffeine Content (mg per 8 oz)**|
|:-|:-|
|**Dancong Tea**|Approximately 20-30 mg|
|**Tieguanyin**|About 30-50 mg|
|**Cinnamon Oolong**|Typically around 20-30 mg|
|**Golden Peony**|Approximately 30-40 mg|
|**Yellow Rose**|Typically around 30-40 mg|
|**Dahongpao**|About 30-50 mg|

# Where Does¬†the Caffeine in Oolong Tea¬†Come From?

The caffeine in oolong tea, like all tea, comes from the Camellia sinensis plant, which naturally contains caffeine in its leaves.

The concentration of caffeine in oolong tea is influenced by several factors, including:

# Tea leaves

The age and part of the plant used can affect caffeine levels. Younger leaves and buds tend to have higher caffeine content.

# Processing method

Oolong tea is partially oxidized, which affects its flavor and caffeine content. The level of oxidation (how much the leaves are allowed to ferment) can slightly influence how much caffeine is retained in the final tea.

# Growing conditions

Factors such as the altitude, climate, and soil where the tea is grown also affect the caffeine content in the leaves.

# Which tea has the most CaffeineÔºü

# Which Chinese Tea Has the Highest Caffeine Content?

>

The caffeine levels in black tea are generally higher because of the full oxidation process during its production.Oolong caffiene level is between green and black teas.



Here‚Äôs a rough comparison of caffeine content across popular Chinese teas:

**Black Tea**¬†: Highest caffeine content due to full oxidation.

**Oolong Tea :**¬†Moderate caffeine content, as it is partially oxidized.

**Green Tea**¬†: Lower caffeine content since it undergoes minimal oxidation.

**White Tea**¬†: Usually has the least caffeine, as it is the least processed.

# Is Oolong Tea Considered High in Caffeine?

Oolong tea is¬†**moderate**¬†in caffeine compared to other teas. It falls between¬†**black tea**¬†(which has the highest caffeine content) and¬†**green tea**¬†(which has lower caffeine levels).

On average, an 8 oz (240 ml) cup of oolong tea contains around¬†**30 to 50 mg**¬†of caffeine, which is less than a typical cup of black tea but more than green or white tea.

# How to lower caffeine content during Oolong tea consumptionÔºü

People who are sensitive to caffeine, but still enjoy drinking teaÔºåhere are the way to lower oolong caffeine:

# 

# Amout of tea leaves

Reducing the amount of tea leaves used can also help lower the caffeine content in each cup of tea.

# Less Tea, Less Caffeine

By simply using fewer tea leaves, you‚Äôll automatically reduce the caffeine concentration in your brew. Instead of the typical 1 teaspoon of leaves per cup, try using ¬Ω teaspoon for a lighter, less caffeinated tea.

# Steeping time

The longer you steep your oolong tea, the more caffeine will be released into the water. Controlling the steeping time can significantly lower the caffeine levels:

# Shorter Steep Times

For a lower caffeine cup, aim to steep oolong tea for only 1-2 minutes instead of the typical 3-5 minutes. The majority of caffeine is released in the first minute of steeping, so shorter brewing times reduce overall caffeine content.

# Rinsing the tea leaves with Boiling water

Rinsing the oolong tea leaves before brewing is another effective way to lower caffeine.

>

How It Works?

Pour hot water (around 200¬∞F or 93¬∞C) over your tea leaves and let them sit for 20-30 seconds before discarding the water. This ""rinsing"" process will release some of the initial caffeine, allowing you to reduce the amount that ends up in your final brew.

# Oolong tea caffeine vs Coffee

# Is Oolong Tea a Lower-Caffeine Alternative to Coffee?

**Oolong tea**¬†can be considered a¬†**lower-caffeine alternative to coffee**.

The caffeine content in oolong tea is typically much lower than that in coffee.An 8 oz cup of coffee generally contains about¬†**95 to 200 milligrams**¬†of caffeine.

Oolong teas making it a more moderate option for those looking to reduce their caffeine intake without giving up a stimulating beverage altogether.

1km4xrx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1km4xrx,Exploring a Bit of Taiwan's Sofubi (Soft Vinyl Toy) Scene During My Trip,"Hello!

I had wanted to post something here since I got to spend almost a month in Taiwan between December 2023 to January 2024, but really wanted to find something unique I guess, to highlight in my write-up about the trip. I'm really into soft vinyl toys, or 'sofubi', though I‚Äôm not a creator myself, I have been a hardcore collector since 2016 (i.e. curating my collection for certain artists, getting to understand the history, etc.). I've started posting more on reddit about sofubi and even mod a sub now, which I guess sparked this idea to focus my post on these toys. So, I wanted to highlight this little art form and Taiwan, who I believe has grown to be a big player in the scene.

While Taiwan has long been host to the major international Taipei Toy Festival for sofubi (since 2004, with its 22nd show coming in November), I think Taiwan is relatively new in homegrown artists and it's exciting to see the rise. Some of my favorites include Lalayo Wing, bokigirl1, HDDToys, and Pathfinder Vinyl Toys, who I believe all started this decade. Though I don't own their pieces, Staaan and AKSOULMUCH are also prominent names right now. This surge of artists and interest (which seems to have grown since the mid-2010s, based on the emergence of dedicated shops. Someone feel free to check me on that though.) has led to more specialized stores, additional conventions, and pop-up events.

During my time in Taiwan, I made an effort to visit some shops as the opportunity presented itself, though noting a majority of them are in Taipei. Please excuse the photo quality (which are not great) as I share my chronological stops and some quick notes:

* **Mushroom Toys, Tainan (Pics 1-3):** The first shop I got to hit up, a two-story store with a gallery upstairs (which was hosting ""1001 Toys"" during my visit). Broadly, Mushroom Toys has been growing as a key player and doing a lot for the Taiwanese scene, having just hosted their 3rd annual Mushroom Festival in March, attracting some big name international artists like Punk Drunkers and BlackBook Toy. ([More pics here of the shop here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sofubi/comments/1kfo9eh/mushroom_toys_tainan_taiwan/))
* **Boro Boro Coffee, Taichung (4-5):** A cool coffee shop with a second level hosting art shows where sofubi is sold from time to time. Unfortunately for myself, I went on a day that they were still prepping the gallery area, so couldn't see that part of the cafe, but did get to enjoy some coffee. ([More pics here of the cafe here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sofubi/comments/1klvvv4/boro_boro_coffee_taichung_city_taiwan/))
* **Hot Dog Toyz, Taipei (6):** A bit hard to find, and I recall photos weren't allowed inside (borrowing an exterior shot from Google). They have hosted and carry toys from the popular Japanese maker Konatsuya, especially their character Negora. The owner was incredibly friendly and we had a great chat about toys and Taiwan.
* **Little Hut Co/Paradise Toy, Taipei (7):** Seemingly affiliated and next door to each other (borrowing a photo of the outside again). Paradise Toy featured a lot of LeeeeeeToy from Hong Kong, while Little Hut is an art gallery that sometimes showcases sofubi artists.
* **Wrong Gallery, Taipei (8-10):** Known as a vendor for bringing toys from Hong Kong, China, and Taiwan to US conventions (DesignerCon in my experience). Their Taipei gallery is primarily art-focused, with some sofubi for sale at the front. During my visit, they hosted the charming work of Korean artist Varietysum.

Towards the end of my trip, as I was scrolling through artists I follow on Instagram, I stumbled upon a post for a  small but awesome convention, **NU-DE Toy Salon** in Taipei. I cleared my morning to attend and it was such an awesome show, great to get meet Taiwanese artists in person (pic 11 featuring Wusukumi) and even see familiar faces from US conventions. Been following the show since then and they seem to be planning another show this June.

Beyond the toys, I absolutely loved my time in Taiwan and hope to return someday. I spent a large amount of time in Kaohsiung and enjoyed a road trip along the east making pit stops at Taitung, Hualien, and Luodong to name a few places. I didn't expect or prep for a lot of outdoorsy activity (just poor planning), but wished I had way more time in Taroko National Park and to bike all of Sun Moon Lake. I also had many great interactions with locals; I didn't do much research prior, but as a Teochew speaker, I was surprised and happy to discover that Taiwanese is a variety of Min, making some words familiar (not saying I could understand a full conversation üòÇ). I had a Taipei bar owner enlighten me further on the dialect and it all kinda made me feel at home.

Anyways thanks for reading, would love to know if anyone else here is into sofubi and I invite you to come check out r/Sofubi if you want to see and learn more about it all!",7,1747191592.0,taiwan,1,1.0,False

I want to give everyone a chance to guess what these beans are, so I'm giving 2 weeks time.  I'll pay to mail the prize bags out myself to the top 6 closest guesses, and will contact folks via dm after May 28 to coordinate give aways. And I'll congratulate the winners on here by username.  

I'm not here to advertise my coffee co, nor to give hints so I'm not saying anything else and don't plan to talk about my roastery or other coffee offerings or anything after May 28th, don't worry.  But I will reveal the answers so everyone gets to know what this coffee is exactly and see if their guess was close.

I'm just really curious if anyone else out there can judge beans just by the looks of them.  Only first guesses count.  I'll try to take all factors into consideration.  Country of origin/region/city location of farm will be highest value, followed by roast date and then farm process method.  I'll just try to triangulate using that basis as best I can.  

Much love to you all and good luck!",0,1747191205.0,roasting,3,0.4,False

1. The beauty everywhere, mountains, lakes, rivers, many wonderful species of wildlife, endless breathtaking views everywhere.

2. The wine and cider ofcourse (Currently drinking some BC cider rn.) Can't leave that out.

3. The wonderful dog parks/beaches, trails and such. My dog absolutely loves it here. It would be abuse to ever take her away from here. 

4. The human beaches are great as well

5. While a lot of work to be done, it seems a lot of people here care about the environment here and want to see this place stay beautiful and I am all for that.

6. The happiness, people out here for the most part seem very happy, especially when that suns out. I find I connect with people so much easier here, and am meeting more friends than I ever have, but that may be due to happiness I now feel as this place has brought me to a better place.

7. I love the vast access to locally owned and operated markets/stores/shops.

8. The hiking here is amazing coming from the praries. Hiking up hill/up mountains is an adjustment but I love it and it is very rewarding and going back to the beauty part, It makes it that much more nice.

9. I'm impressed with the great food out here such as Arby's. 

10. Last but not least, the magpies. More specifically, the family of magpies I have been supporting. They bring me so much joy during my morning coffee and my afternoon cider. The intelligence and emotions these corvids have is amazing. Genuinely feel like they are present and know what's going on, and share a mutual respect with me.

Ik its corny but I've learned being positive and saying good things will never do you any harm.

1km4sm8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1km4sm8,ETS Recap,"My friends Walter and David joined me recently for the East Texas Showdown, a bikepacking event created and hosted by Patrick Farnsworth of the Bikes or Death Podcast. The event, now in its fifth year, actually has three different routes: the Showdown at 400 miles, the Slowdown at 280 miles, and the Lowdown at 165 miles. I have been looking to take on the 400-mile Showdown since its inception, and 2025 was the year to make it happen. 
While the Showdown is technically a race, we entered with the intention of racing nothing. I planned to do what Patrick calls Pro Slow. At some point, I started referring to it as the Showdown at a Slowdown pace. The goal was to go out, do what I love, and enjoy an epic adventure. Meeting new people along the way and experiencing what the course had to offer, like the millions of fragrant wildflowers, adds to the experience even more. As for the epic factor, the 400 miles of the Showdown surely qualified.
This event was different from others for me. Normally I am in great shape with well over a thousand miles in the couple of months leading up to it. This time around I was well below 700 miles for the year, 146 of them coming the weekend before. This was not of my own volition. Several circumstances, including a car wreck the year before, had kept me from really riding as much as I liked. Nonetheless, this was not going to stop me. After all, I was there to enjoy the adventure, unencumbered by the pressures of competition. 
The event started out in an epic fashion. After eight miles of road in a neutral start, the gravel and dirt roads started. Rain the night before and that morning had made the course quite sloppy. While I expected the going to be slow, the course conditions made it even slower. The mud and soft sand were no friend to any of us that day. My determination to complete the event stayed high, and I pushed forward with my friends. After the first section of muddy roads, we were greeted by some very beautiful pavement. The miles, of course, before then gave me a new appreciation for the hard, unwavering nature of asphalt. To make things even better, just a little ways down that road was a large spigot that was spraying out. The local water company's task of purging a line was a prime opportunity that was seized by many to knock much of the mud from the drivetrains of our bikes. 
As the day went on, conditions generally improved despite an additional rainstorm that lasted about 10 minutes. As we ticked off the miles, I ran into Todd, a fellow Bikepacking Roots Community Steward. After making his acquaintance and making a stop to resupply our water, we kept moving. We came across several puddles the size of the road. They had hard bottoms, which made things easy, but apprehension creeps in when you can see the bottom or know how deep they are. A long and slow 55 miles later, we found lunch at a Brookshire Brothers Express. Here a Subway sandwich, some chips, and two Gatorlytes were on the menu for me. The employees were awesome and even had a water hose ready for us to clean our bikes. It was nice to get the bulk of the mud from the bike, which easily removed several pounds from my already heavy steed. 
After a short break, we moseyed on out to skies that were not looking too friendly again. We pushed a decent pace in an effort to avoid more sloppy dirt roads. Unfortunately, it did not take very long, and we were in a heavy downpour that lasted about 10 minutes. The now sticky and muddy dirt roads slowed our pace. Making matters worse was my preparation leading up to the event. My legs were not very happy, and I started to feel weak. Doubt crept into my mind about what I was going to be able to accomplish. It had become a struggle, and I felt bad for holding up Walter and David. 
Eventually we came upon a convenience store where I would get more fluids and some pizza. As soon as I was full, I got back on the bike and headed out. I did not want to slow Walter and David any more than I already had. Temporarily solo on the adventure, I entered the Davy Crockett National Forest. Talk about a beautiful setting. Eventually Walter and David caught up to me, and we discussed where we would spend the night. The original plan was to make it to mile marker 140, the city of Jacksonville, TX. It was clear that was not going to happen any more, so the new plan was to stop at Mission Tejas State Park, which would require us to go off course less than a half mile. 
The going was good, then we realized that we had passed the turnoff to the park by a couple of miles. Not wanting to turn back, we pushed on into the night without a clue of where we would end up. Around mile marker 118, we happened upon a church. This was the perfect spot to stop, camp, and refuel. Unfortunately, we did not get very close to our original plan of mile 140, but 118 was much better than plan B of 91.
Day two started pretty early, and after just six miles, we found ourselves at a small cafe in the middle of nowhere. The people were welcoming, the breakfast was good, and the coffee was free. It was just what we needed to get the day started. Getting back on the road, we found a mix of gravel and mud before a long stretch of pavement into Jacksonville, TX. Here we found lunch at a Whataburger, and after eating and preparing for more miles, we pushed forward with smiles on our faces. 
Once we made our way to the outskirts of the city, we came upon numerous dogs that wanted to be a nuisance on our adventure. One of these dogs, a large yellow lab, ran out after Walter and right in front of me. It was a close call, but no dog or human was harmed. Further down the same road, a couple was sitting out at the road cheering us on. They even knew our names, making for a fun exchange. They even warned us about some small dogs a little down the road. Sure enough, a pack of vicious chihuahuas came out and chased us for about 30 feet before retreating back to their yard.
The riding continued on with the miles going by slowly. Dinner was found at another small restaurant that had some great fried fish. We also ran into Todd again; somehow we kept leapfrogging each other without seeing when it happened. An enjoyable conversation over dinner ensued before we put in another 25 miles to camp at Soloman Lake Park. Here we were welcomed to showers and an indoor space to camp inside their Crazy Horse Saloon. They even had snacks and water for us to partake in. Once I set up my sleeping pad, pillow, and quilt, I slept well on the floor next to my bike. 
The next morning was again an early one. For Day three, we planned to make the start/finish line at the Bullet Grill for the night, mile marker 327. Doing so would mean just 66 miles to go the next day. My poor preparation leading up to the event was really showing again. I was sore in places that aren't fun, and then I struggled to keep up with Walter and David at times. Breakfast for me was oatmeal that I had packed, and I placed a couple of candy bars in my feed bag for down the road. We all prepped our bikes and ate before quickly making our way out of the saloon and down the road. 
We made it to Trinity, TX, around lunchtime. There we would find a Brookshire Brothers supermarket. I refilled my supplies and had another candy bar, this time a Twix. A Gatorlyte and a couple of cold oranges were consumed here also. I never thought cold oranges could be so good. Thanks to the supermarket, we were well supplied for the remainder of the day. We made our way along the course, enjoying the views and flowers, escaping the occasional loose dog, and having a good time. I expected to make it back to the Bullet Grill after dark but was happy to do it with the tiniest sliver of light left. We set up camp and went to the grill to get some food. However, there was one problem: the kitchen closed early on Sundays. Lucky for us, though, there were some snacks available, and we were gifted some sandwiches to fill our stomachs. After that, we were off to bed with anticipation of the final day.
Day four arrived after a warm night in my tent. I did shed a couple of items, most notably my tent that I left set up, but I could not bring myself to shed everything. After all, I was bikepacking, and what would I be doing with nothing on the bike? Walter and David agreed I just wanted to punish myself with the extra weight on the bike. There were 66 miles of the Death Star Loop, and we were complete. This turned out to be some of the most beautiful riding of it all. The Sam Houston National Forest was the primary setting. It is no secret that I love the forest, as I love the trees, the views, and the sounds of the forest. This place made me happy. The roads were pretty good as the rain expected overnight stayed away. We pushed on, taking a couple of breaks to snack but otherwise keeping a rather steady pace. Just before 2 pm, we returned to the Bullet Grill, officially completing the East Texas Showdown. After packing up and changing clothes, plus some much-needed deodorant, we sat down at the Bullet Grill for a well-earned meal. The adventure did not disappoint. Thank you to Patrick and all the volunteers who helped make this possible. We have even talked about doing it again next year. ",6,1747191150.0,bikepacking,1,1.0,False

While I have my own biological family, the connection isn't as fulfilling as I'd hoped, and I find myself longing for a different kind of kinship ‚Äì a family built on shared values, genuine connection, and mutual support.

I'm in my early 40s, living in the Rochester, NY area, and I'm looking to connect with others who might feel similarly. Maybe you've also experienced distance from your biological family or you've always dreamed of expanding your circle with people who truly get you.

What I'm envisioning is creating a chosen family ‚Äì a network of individuals who can offer emotional support, share life's joys and challenges, and build meaningful traditions together. Think get-togethers, game nights, helping each other out with projects, camping trips, or simply being there to listen when someone needs an ear.

I'm open to connecting with people of all ages, backgrounds, and walks of life. What's important to me is finding individuals who are:

* **Kind and compassionate:** Empathy and understanding are essential.
* **Open and honest:** I value genuine communication.
* **Reliable and supportive:** Someone who will be there, and who I can be there for.
* **Respectful of boundaries:** Understanding and respecting each other's needs is crucial.
* **Looking for genuine connection:** This isn't about casual acquaintances, but building something deeper.
* LGBTQ+ friendly and accepting of differences.

I'm not entirely sure what this will look like in practice, and I'm open to ideas and suggestions. Maybe we start with a casual meet-up for coffee or a low-key activity. The important thing is to start building those connections.

If this resonates with you, and you're also in the Rochester, NY area and looking to cultivate a stronger sense of chosen family, please feel free to send me a chat and tell me a little about yourself and what you're looking for.

This might be a long shot, but I truly believe that meaningful connections are out there, and sometimes you have to take a leap of faith to find them.

Here‚Äôs my recommendations for bars, food, and such for anyone coming from out of town - downtown can be repetitive, here‚Äôs some off the beaten path spots from someone who just graduated. Hope this helps. 

Food Casual:

‚Ä¢	‚Å†Big Gun Burger - great burgs, cheap drinks and a pool table
‚Ä¢	‚Å†60 Bull Cafe - awesome breakfast and lunch
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Marina Variety Store - just go and see for yourself (my favorite breakfast spot)
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Moes Crosstown Tavern - best wings in town
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Bay St Biergarten - solid food, lots of TVs and a great huge draft selection
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Lewis BBQ - better than Home team and on the same street
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Circes Grotto or Legend Deli - fucking awesome sammys and both on CofC campus so check that out
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Cafecito - great coffee
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Queen ST Grocery -
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Torres Suprettes - damn good burrito
‚Ä¢	‚Å†East Side Soulfood - ill personally be sucking this down pre show on Sat

Plenty more... these are just my favorites.

Food Upscale:

‚Ä¢	‚Å†Grill 225 or Oak Steakhouse - traditional steakhouses that do it right (Hall's Blows)
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Leons - walk ins only so expect a wait but worth the chicken, fish and oysters. They do it well here.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Darling Oyster Bar - best oysters in town and great happy hour (4-6)
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Malagon - fucking gasssss and great for small groups
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Southbound - super damn nice, however a great song and name for a place, food is top tier. (Will the boys ever cover this song?)
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Indaco - italian that does the job
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Little Jacks - upscale burgers, somehow the chicken milanese is the best thing on the menu.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Maam Saab - really really good Pakitsani food, tried this on a whim and can't wait to go back. Cocktails are some of the best ive had too.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Church and Union - overhyped but always good

On Peninsula, there isn't much middle ground for food. Either super nice... or a cheap dive. Just walk around and find something!

So stoked the boys are back in town again.

But how do they truly compare? Instant coffee may not have the same depth of flavor or aroma as freshly brewed coffee. Its quick preparation appeals to busy schedules and those who need a fast caffeine fix. Real coffee, on the other hand, brings a ritual of preparation and a variety of tastes.

Many coffee lovers appreciate the complexity and freshness found in ground beans. Yet, instant coffee has evolved, with some brands offering improved taste profiles. Understanding the differences helps you choose what fits your lifestyle and taste.¬†[So, let‚Äôs dive into this comparison to explore which coffee option might be best for you.](https://gomehedi.com/top-10-best-instant-coffee-in-the-world/)

# Taste Comparison

Is instant coffee as delightful as a freshly brewed cup? Many coffee lovers ponder this question. The debate isn‚Äôt just about convenience versus tradition; it‚Äôs about taste. Coffee enthusiasts often argue that the flavor is the heart of the experience. Let‚Äôs dive into the taste comparison between instant coffee and real coffee. Explore how these two varieties differ in flavor profiles and aroma.

# Flavor Profiles

Instant coffee and real coffee present distinct flavor profiles. Each offers unique experiences. Here‚Äôs a closer look:

* **Instant Coffee:**¬†Often, it‚Äôs milder with a smooth finish. Some say it lacks depth. The process removes some oils and compounds that create rich flavors.
* **Real Coffee:**¬†Offers a broader range of flavors. You might taste notes of chocolate, fruit, or nuts. The brewing process helps preserve the oils and compounds.

Flavor also varies by type:

|Type|Instant Coffee|Real Coffee|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Bold|Less intense|Rich and strong|
|Mild|Gentle and smooth|Balanced and nuanced|

Both types can satisfy different taste preferences. Some prefer instant for its simplicity. Others enjoy the complexity of real coffee.

# Aroma Differences

Aroma plays a significant role in coffee enjoyment. It can enhance or diminish the overall experience.

**Instant Coffee:**¬†The aroma is often lighter. The manufacturing process affects the scent. It might not be as enticing or fresh.

**Real Coffee:**¬†Known for its robust aroma. Freshly ground beans release a rich, inviting scent. It can fill a room and awaken the senses.

Aroma differences can be summarized:

1. **Complexity:**¬†Real coffee often has a layered scent. Instant coffee may smell flat.
2. **Intensity:**¬†Freshly brewed coffee tends to be more aromatic. Instant coffee might lack this depth.

Choosing between instant and real coffee can hinge on aroma preference. For some, the smell is as vital as the taste.

# Nutritional Value

Instant coffee and real coffee both have their unique appeal. While instant coffee is quick and convenient, real coffee often boasts a richer taste. But how do they compare in terms of nutritional value? Understanding the nutritional aspects can help you make an informed choice. Let‚Äôs delve into the caffeine content and antioxidant levels of both types of coffee.

# Caffeine Content

One of the main reasons people drink coffee is for its caffeine. Caffeine gives you that boost of energy. But how does instant coffee stack up against real coffee in this regard?

Instant coffee typically contains less caffeine than brewed coffee. Here‚Äôs a closer look:

|Type of Coffee|Caffeine Content (per 8 oz cup)|
|:-|:-|
|Instant Coffee|60-80 mg|
|Brewed Coffee|95-165 mg|

* Instant coffee has less caffeine, which may be better for those sensitive to caffeine.
* Brewed coffee offers a stronger caffeine boost, ideal for those needing more energy.

**Instant coffee**¬†is a lighter option for caffeine intake. While¬†**real coffee**¬†offers more punch, it might not be suitable for everyone. Consider your caffeine needs when choosing.

# Antioxidant Levels

Antioxidants are vital for your health. They protect your body from damage by free radicals. Coffee is a significant source of antioxidants for many people. But how does instant coffee compare to real coffee?

Both instant and real coffee contain antioxidants. Here‚Äôs a breakdown:

* **Chlorogenic acids**: Both types have these, which help in reducing inflammation and regulating blood sugar.
* **Polyphenols**: These compounds are present in both, aiding in heart health and reducing the risk of certain diseases.

Surprisingly,¬†**instant coffee**¬†can have slightly higher antioxidant levels. This is due to the way it‚Äôs processed. The concentration of solids in instant coffee may contribute to this.

1. Both types offer health benefits from antioxidants.
2. Instant coffee can be a convenient source of antioxidants.
3. Real coffee provides a more complex flavor with its antioxidants.

Choosing between instant and real coffee depends on what you value more‚Äîconvenience or flavor. Both options contribute positively to your antioxidant intake.

# Preparation Methods

Preparing coffee can be a simple delight or a meticulous ritual. Instant coffee offers convenience, while real coffee provides a richer experience. Understanding the preparation methods can help you decide which suits your lifestyle and taste buds. Both have unique processes and flavors, catering to diverse preferences. Let‚Äôs explore how each type is made and what makes them distinct.

# Brewing Instant Coffee

Instant coffee is known for its¬†**quick and easy preparation**. It‚Äôs perfect for busy mornings or when you‚Äôre on the go. The process involves dissolving dried coffee granules in hot water. This method is straightforward and doesn‚Äôt require special equipment.

* **Boil water**: Use a kettle or microwave.
* **Measure coffee**: Usually one to two teaspoons per cup.
* **Add water**: Pour hot water over the granules.
* **Stir**: Mix until fully dissolved.

Instant coffee is convenient but lacks the complexity of real coffee. It often contains added flavors or sweeteners. Despite being quick, it delivers a¬†**simpler taste**¬†profile.

|Pros|Cons|
|:-|:-|
|Fast preparation|Less flavor depth|
|No equipment needed|May contain additives|

This option suits those who prioritize speed and simplicity over richness and aroma.

# Making Real Coffee

Real coffee involves a more¬†**involved brewing process**. It allows for customization and experimentation with flavors. Common methods include using a drip coffee maker, French press, or espresso machine.

1. Make sure to get cash. Although many places will accept credit cards, local spots tend to only take cash, with a preference for BZD. Many also accept USD.

2. Highly recommend taking dives from here. I used Chuck & Robbie‚Äôs for my PADI open water certification, and can‚Äôt recommend them enough. My husband and I had a private boat with Felipe, who was very knowledgeable and patient. We were able to be trained in Hol Chan and Esmeralda Canyons, which were unbelievable! We saw nurse sharks, hammerhead sharks, eels, lobsters, turtles, and more. 

3. Check out the local spots for delicious and affordable food. We loved Yoli‚Äôs Deli, and we were also recommended to go to Brianna‚Äôs, Warugamas (for papusas), and Sixteen Ounces (coffee). 

4. If you want to cook, buy groceries before you get to San Pedro. Prices are much cheaper in Chetumal, the mainland, or Caye Caulker. 

5. Similarly, buy your sunscreen and bug spray before you get to San Pedro or Caye Caulker. 

6. Confirm the location of the ferry stop you‚Äôre planning to take if walking to your next location is a concern. The stop to/from Belize City and Caye Caulker moved a 15 minute walk south, by Isla Bonita Boat Club. The stop to/from Chetumal is on the west side of the island, by the International Ferry Terminal. 

7. Buy ferry tickets once you know your departure time. My husband and I decided to play it by ear, and buy tickets day off. All boat times for San Pedro Express were sold out except for one.

1km4dxq,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1km4dxq/the_hollowing/,The Hollowing,"It started with a mirror.

Maya inherited the old farmhouse after her grandmother passed, tucked in a forgotten stretch of the Appalachian woods. A place where fog slithered between the trees like living breath, and silence clung too thickly for comfort. The house was crumbling, yes‚Äîbut not empty.

In the attic, she found the mirror. It stood eight feet tall, framed in twisting, knotted black wood like petrified vines. It wasn‚Äôt dusty. Not even a smudge.

At first, it only reflected her.

Then one night, it didn‚Äôt.


Maya was brushing her teeth when she noticed it. In the mirror, she raised her hand to her face‚Äîbut the reflection paused, watching her. Then, smiling faintly, it mirrored her motion a moment too late.

She dropped the brush.

The reflection didn‚Äôt.

From that night on, it followed her‚Äînot just in the mirror, but in whispers behind doors, in laughter that sounded just like hers, from the other side of the wall.



The locals had warned her, in the way that sounded like jokes: ‚ÄúThe woods got voices. Don‚Äôt talk back, or they remember your tone.‚Äù She thought it was folklore.

Until the mimic came.

It looked like her, down to the chipped nail polish and crescent scar under her eye. It spoke like her too, only off, like an echo from a throat that didn't quite understand speech.

Maya woke up one night to it sitting at the edge of her bed, smiling.

‚ÄúI love this house,‚Äù it said. ‚ÄúWe love this house.‚Äù

She ran. It didn‚Äôt stop her.


In town, no one believed her. ‚ÄúStress,‚Äù they said. ‚ÄúGrief.‚Äù But she knew better. She felt it, every time she passed a mirror, or glanced into glass. There were always two Mayas now‚Äîone watching, and one trying to survive.

She boarded up the mirror, locked the attic, and tried to move on.

But the reflection didn‚Äôt stay behind the glass anymore.



She met her friend Jules for coffee, relief flooding her. A chance to be seen by someone real.

Except Jules tilted her head and said, ‚ÄúYou were here yesterday. You told me you‚Äôd finally let go of your grandmother‚Äôs things.‚Äù

‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt,‚Äù Maya whispered. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been home.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh. Well... you hugged me before you left. You said you forgave me for not coming to the funeral.‚Äù

Maya had never blamed her.

And Maya had never hugged her.



By the time she returned to the farmhouse, the lights were on. Curtains parted. The door unlocked.

Inside, her own laughter echoed.

The mimic wore her face like a second skin, perfectly, except its eyes. Its eyes were hollow.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve made this body so cozy,‚Äù it whispered, stepping toward her. ‚ÄúBut you don‚Äôt need it anymore.‚Äù

She ran.

It followed.



That was two weeks ago.

No one has seen Maya since. But the one in her skin walks the town, visits Jules, and smiles into mirrors that no longer reflect anything but her.

If you ever visit that farmhouse, don‚Äôt look too long in the glass.

You might not be the only one looking back.
And worse‚Ä¶ you might not leave alone.

1km49dz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1km49dz,I rizzed up my neighbor who was complaining about my friends,"It‚Äôs 10:21 PM and this literally just happened. My neighbor texted me super respectfully saying the cigarette and weed smoke from my friends (who smoke on my balcony when they visit) has been filling her apartment  and it‚Äôs triggering her allergies and her aunt‚Äôs asthma. She even said she can tell when someone lights up at 2AM. Caught the boys in 4K.

I apologized, let her know I‚Äôd be more mindful, and said if there were certain times she preferred we avoid the balcony, I‚Äôd appreciate it if she told me.

She explained how bad it gets and ended with, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre super nice though ‚ù§Ô∏è I appreciate it.‚Äù So I figured‚Ä¶ why not shoot my shot? I said, ‚ÄúIf you ever wanna hang out or grab coffee on the weekend, let me know.‚Äù

She hits me back saying she barely gets a day off because she works two jobs, but she‚Äôs trying to cut back  ‚ÄúWe should definitely hang out!‚Äù Then followed up with ‚ÄúThat sounds great! I‚Äôll take your offer.‚Äù

I was just trying to keep the peace‚Ä¶ now I might be her peace.

Here the lyrics :

She wakes up late, eyes tired and cold,

One last kiss, I love you like no one will do

One last kiss, I needed you and I miss you too

One last kiss, I need you like I need a broken Knife

The night falls hard, she won‚Äôt sleep a wink,

Her thoughts race on, faster than she thinks.

The clock ticks loud, but she can‚Äôt feel time,

The silence swells, drowning out her mind.

She laughs in the crowd, but it‚Äôs not real,

She‚Äôs waiting for someone who‚Äôll help her heal.

The shadows grow long, but she doesn‚Äôt mind,

Hiding the hurt, trying to rewind.

She dreams of a day when she‚Äôll be set free,

But the pain‚Äôs too strong, and she can‚Äôt break free.

One last kiss, I love you with a broken heart

One last kiss, I love you like a little freak

One last kiss, I need you like I need a deadly pill

One last kiss, I love you like no one will do

One last kiss, I needed you and I don‚Äôt miss you now

One last kiss, I need you like I need a broken knife

1km4738,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1km4738/i_feel_empty/,I feel empty,"She woke me up a few days ago and broke up with me, no emotion on her face, just asked if I was mad, and if I wanted some coffee. 

She pushed me out, said I wasn't there, said that the love I give isn't what she wants. I'm too emotional, I don't give her enough sex, that she feels like dying because we don't do it twice a day. 

I was shocked. She was leaving me because of the normal amount of sex we had, not because of the love I gave. The life we made, the moments we've shared, the responsibility I took proudly as a stepfather meant nothing. 

She changed after she attempted suicide. She became angry, cold, I couldn't see the women I loved in those eyes anymore. 

I took care of her after she left the hospital, assumed responsibilities for her to feel safe, did what I could to make home, home.

I keep reading over these messages, trying to find resolve, looking for why she could just send me to the streets with nowhere to go, and without hesitation. I love her, I love the kids. I love our little family, but they aren't mine anymore.

She says she still wants me to be part of the children's lives, but I don't think I can. I can't look at her without falling to pieces, and she just looks on while hanging out with the man that hates me. 

I'm lost, I'm confused, hurt, angry. Angry at myself for not being what she wanted, angry at her for making me think what I gave was enough until it just wasn't. I miss her, I miss us, I miss me. 

My family has been trying to reach out, friends have wondered where I've been, but I'm still sitting on the same barstool that I have been for days, trying to find reason and my life back at the bottom of these fucking bottles.

I don't want to feel, sometimes I wish for more, sometimes for less. I don't know where I'm going, and I don't know what I'm doing. I'm here, I'm right fucking here. I'm a person, I want to feel like a person. I don't feel like I am. I'm lost, but I can't help looking back. I just want to go back home.

The idea of having sex with someone who‚Äôs doing it out of obligation grosses me out. When it‚Äôs been a while it‚Äôs not a big deal for me to take care of myself and she‚Äôs often good about being down for some mutual masturbation even when she‚Äôs not down for full on sex. 

Sometimes she‚Äôs been really apologetic with me for having a lower drive and I‚Äôve tried to be reassuring with her telling her that when we do get it on it‚Äôs mind-blowing (true) and the frequency isn‚Äôt really all that bad, my previous relationship was a literal sexless marriage. Usually I avoid having my feelings hurt by this issue but sometimes I‚Äôll experience some short-lived sadness/loneliness over it but it‚Äôs not something I dwell on.

So anyways, this morning I woke up and my wife was already awake and downstairs having coffee which I learned when I texted her hi. Over the last couple of days we‚Äôve flirted and goosed one another in a way that often means that sex is imminent and we‚Äôd recently had a missed connection where we were both down but a logistical snafu put the kibosh on it. She asked me what I was up to and I said I was going to shower. I guess I got hopeful that maybe she would come up to join me so I dilly-dallied and killed time for a bit with my fingers crossed, but no dice. I was a little disappointed but not the end of the world. Instead of showering I headed downstairs for some coffee of my own, when I saw my wife I said, in what I intended as a joking tone, ‚ÄúWell I gave up on waiting for you to come join me in the shower.‚Äù  This set things off.

She got really mad and said I was a big jerk for saying this and that I was acting like a 50‚Äôs misogynist husband for punishing her for not ‚Äúperforming her duties‚Äù and what a dick I was. I admit that maybe I did allow some disappointment to sneak into my tone but I wasn‚Äôt trying to be recriminating. I feel like if the roles had been reversed that for her to say something similar wouldn‚Äôt have been outrageous or cruel.

When I got a little mad at what I felt was her casting me as a villain she got even madder and said now I was ‚Äúsilencing her‚Äù, I guess performing more of the misogynist domination that I‚Äôm known for. When I suggested that I wasn‚Äôt trying to make her feel punished and that maybe she had some insecurities that were making her feel attacked when I wasn‚Äôt putting her on trial she got even madder and we‚Äôve since spent the day fighting. 

tl;dr made a joke with my wife that I was a little disappointed that she didn‚Äôt come find me for sex and we‚Äôve spent the day fighting
