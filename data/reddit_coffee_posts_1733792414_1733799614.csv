1harxzh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1harxzh/i_am_completely_incapable_of_clarifying_stock/,I am completely incapable of clarifying stock,"I've tried this 3 separate times and have failed every time. Please help me understand what I'm doing wrong. I'm trying to clarify broth for a clear matzo ball soup. Here are my steps:

1. Make a stock. I've been putting a whole chicken in my instant pot with water, celery, onion, and garlic.

2. Strain the stock.

3. Let the stock cool. I've let it sit for up to an hour. It's not getting cold, but warm. Maybe ~130F.

4. Beat 3 egg whites until foamy. I'm not getting them to peaks, just foamy.

5. Mix egg whites into stock. I barely do this. 1 small swirl of the spoon.

6. Heat over medium heat. I've done this for 10-20 minutes.

At this point, I've been told a ""raft"" will form that can be scooped off. Well, every time I do it I do get egg whites at the top. I also get them stuck to the bottom of the pot. And the sides of the pot. And much worse - I get a TON of fine bits of scrambled egg whites that are just floating in my stock. If I turn off the heat and wait a lot of them will settle near the bottom, but they are still suspended in the liquid. And I absolutely cannot get them out. If I strain the liquid with a fine mesh strainer, the fine scrambled egg whites just flow right through. If I use a folded cheesecloth then the stock trickles through so slowly that it would seriously take 4+ hours to strain. If I use a coffee filter it's even worse, it slows to less than a steady drip.

So now, instead of clean broth, I have broth that is filled with scrambled eggs. Tonight was supposed to be matzo ball soup, and instead we had McDonald's 😭 Please help me, what on earth am I doing wrong!?",1,1733799483.0,Cooking,0,1.0,False

1harxc7,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPS/comments/1harxc7/reporting_daughters_daycare_to_cps/,Reporting daughters daycare to CPS,"Hello,

My wife and I recently pulled our infant daughter from daycare due to a troubling complaint inspection. 

A former employee of the in-home daycare (who was since fired) complained with our state regarding the owner/provider regarding something we are unsure of at this time.
The inspector came, and before the inspector arrived, the owner/provider instructed an unreported and unapproved adult to remove an infant from the daycare to hide from the inspector because there were too many infants. My wife and I have an infant daughter and we IMMEDIATELY pulled her from daycare upon reading this. We fear she was the one who was removed from the daycare in the providers attempt to deceive the state inspector. We are grateful the inspector caught her.

We have called the state and regional offices to try and find out more. Unfortunately, they can’t reveal anymore than what they have in the report. We have since been able to get in contact with the employee who lodged the complaint that got fired to see if she knows if it was our infant daughter who was removed. We are meeting her for coffee tomorrow to find out what more she knows.

My question: do we have any case to report the provider to CPS? Or would that only be a case if we got confirmation that it was our daughter who was removed from the daycare. Our blood has been boiling, we’ve lost sleep, and our anxiety is through the roof over this. Plus the added stress of finding a new daycare in the middle of winter for infants is very difficult, and of course, we are dealing with the fallout of being ghosted by the provider since we believe we are entitled to our 4 week security deposit. Any advice, even if it is a no, would be appreciated",1,1733799426.0,CPS,1,1.0,False

1harvs6,https://www.reddit.com/r/kurosanji/comments/1harvs6/how_do_you_think_nijisanji_can_earn_back_the/,How do you think Nijisanji can earn back the public's trust again?,"So I've been thinking about what Kuro said recently about management in NijiEN actually improving post Selen Shock. And the thing is is that even if he says all of that, not a lot of people are going to believe him.I know a lot of people haven't been watching them, but some of the livers have said the exact throughout this past year. But of course, nobody believes them.

And why is that?

Well obviously it's because trust has been lost on both the company and even some of the livers.

We've seen in the past whenever the livers would say certain things about the company, they would then get contradicted by either ex-livers or other pieces of information.

""We can just fucking ask for our play button""

There's not been a case of that actually happening, plus Michi's story showed us how much of an iron grip Nijisanji has on those play buttons.

""Selen had our personal information on some documents""

They were legal documents. A court of law isn't going to refer to you by your stage name of course.

""Selen asked for permissions on the Last Cup of Coffee MV way too late""

That's not true as it was confirmed by both Lilypichu and her producer that they signed those legal documents a couple months beforehand. Plus it was actually all for the strange and petty reason of asking permission on having to use characters the company themselves own.

""Management is very supportive in our endeavors""

Doki, Mint, Michi, Kuro, Mata, Sayu, Reza, have all said otherwise.

Plus you have the very disingenuous way some livers have handled their PR statements during the previous termination events. Armchair in his videos talking about them said it the best:

Don't harass anyone. Selen recorded me behind my back for a year.

Don't harass anyone. Zaion gaslit Finana and fought with Xsoleil.

Don't harass anyone. Selen was going to dox us.

All of which has led to massive harassment campaigns against the both of them, one of which was actually doxed and nearly driven to suicide because of it.

In the end these PR statements, whether intentional or not, all became calls for harassment under the guise of 

""Don't harass anyone""

It all has just come across (at least to me) that Nijisanji EN is only a family, until it's not.

So with all that said, that explains why some people may not at all be that confident in what the livers have to say. So I ask, what do you think both the livers and the company can do to bring back public trust again? Is this just a mission that only the company can accomplish if they tried? What could the livers themselves do to earn back your trust?",2,1733799288.0,kurosanji,3,1.0,False

‘Maybe one day you’ll figure out what I actually want,’ Sally says and finds her bra underneath the bed. ‘You do know what a clitoris is, right?’

‘I’m not stupid.’ Stubborn to the end, George lights an incense stick and dabs the match out between his fingers. ‘It sounds like an exotic Italian savoury dish.’

They met a few years ago at Bombay Rock, a popular venue located in Brunswick. It was Retro Night and Sally spotted him near the bar dancing to Depeche Mode’s I Just Can't Get Enough. In tight jeans and a denim jacket, his charming smile persuaded Sally to catch the No.19 tram back to his flat. Indeed a sliding doors moment.

‘For your information, it’s not a fucking Italian dish.’ Bored by the usual outcome, Sally slips her bra back on and laments the bad sex. ‘I’m starting to question the future of our inglorious relationship.’

‘Hello Earth calling Mars, remember our vows.’ George shrugs his shoulders and lights a cigarette. ‘For richer, for poorer, and until death do us part. You get the gist of it.’

‘The only ring I’ve gotten from you is suffer-RING.’ Sally replies and watches George push his luck. ‘I still don’t see a diamond on my finger.’

In a perpetual rut, George hasn’t worked a day since he nearly bankrupted the Department of Finance. An extra zero in front of the decimal point ruined his career. An accountant with fat fingers, he’s made one too many monumental errors, and now a tarnished reputation precedes him. Mud sticks and nobody wants to employ the dickhead.

 ‘Can you hear the noise? They’re coming to take you away.’ George puts his jeans on as a police car siren blares in the distance. ‘Excessive nagging ought to be a criminal offence and punishable with imprisonment.’

‘Have you got rocks in your head?’ Sally replies and storms out of the bedroom. ‘Perhaps, your sexual performance has been flagged for an involuntary Section Ten intervention.’

‘I don’t think so,’ a quick response adds to George’s indefensible guilt. ‘I am the Italian stallion.’

Shattered dreams in the boulevard of broken promises has Sally and George residing in a one-bedroom rental flat on Munro Street. A sign of the times and indicative of their socio-economic reality. Meters from the living room locals mingle while they wait for the No.512 bus and the rowdiness keeps George on his toes. An all too normal scenario and nobody seems bothered.

‘If they try and break-in, I’ll knock their blocks off.’ Unconcerned, George grasps tight onto the baseball bat that he keeps beside the front door. ‘The Neanderthals are literally at the gate.’

‘You couldn’t kill a fly,’ Sally states the truth as she separates the dirty clothes into loads.

Vindictive at heart, she pours triple the recommended amount of fabric softener into the washing machine. Her desire for soft clothes takes precedence, and George’s adverse reaction to the chemicals does not matter. Domestic bliss in modern-day suburbia has him scratching the itch.

The instant relief draws blood and for a moment, life ain’t so bad. He plonks himself into the armchair, kicks his feet onto the coffee table, and cracks open a cold Melbourne Bitter. The beer has no fish bones in it, and he’s got nothing to complain about.

‘Don’t forget to hang the washing,’ Sally swings her handbag over her shoulder and grabs the house keys from the kitchen table. ‘Did you hear what I said?’

‘Hang the washing.’ George repeats and watches Sally walk out the front door. ‘I’m not deaf and while you are out, buy me a packet of chips.’

‘Those two long things attached to your body are called legs.’ Sally replies and slams the door shut. ‘They’re made for walking.’

Sally gives the rowdy idiots a piece of her mind and steps onto the No.512. A brave move and the thought of escaping the madness crosses her mind. She flicks through countless Instagram reels and the algorithm bombards her with an alternative fantastical reality. 

One step to the left on Retro Night and Sally for better or worse, would be living a different life today. Anything is preferable to her underwhelming life and to feel alive in a dead world, she fare evades her way to work. A minor victory and the Melbourne pastime continues unabated.

A few years older than her work colleagues Sally is labelled a relic by the Gen Zedders. She loathes the new generation and to keep the peace tolerates the rhetoric. Their youthful enthusiasm rekindles her desire to rewind the clock, yet she spends hours churning through George’s endless flaws.

‘No fucking way,’ George squirms at the image and cracks open another beer. ‘I would never have guessed.’

Once known, it cannot be unknown and the perennial cockys tounge stars him in the face. Unsure exactly what he’s looking at, George closes the webpage and lets denial work its magic. Better to believe it’s an Italian dish and one after another the beers go down. Why drink one beer when he can have ten?

The No.512 bus carries Sally away from the chaos of Munro Street and an uncertain future awaits. Familiar Coburg landmarks fade into the distance and she rides the bus into the sunset. There’s no chance she’s buying George a packet of chips, let alone returning home, and with a smile on her face forgoes work. A better life awaits on the other side of the Yarra.

The End.

My work includes a hierarchy of power where you have to act a certain way to get where you want (promotions and progressing up the ladder). Make yourself look good and show off the improvements you’ve made for the sake of the business/corporation.

I’ve been working hard showing my worth and will soon be promoted but I’m so sick of being around these people. I have nothing in common with them. I feel myself caring less and less about this promotion and unknown to them, don’t intend on staying in the company all my life.

Now the people themselves are toxic. From treating anyone below them like sh*t, to using their position in the company to do less and less. They like to have digs at me since I’m in fairly good shape and am quite extreme with my diet (10 eggs a day, loads of red meat, no cheat meals). Meanwhile they chuck down a full pack of donuts with their sandwich and coffee full of sugar. 

I used to be close with the other managers on my team, however when I like to make every minute count and keep myself working they don’t mind standing around doing f*** all. They don’t mind giving me the harder jobs either as they know I’ll get it done.

I also treat everyone with the same respect, from the cleaners to the big bosses, which is almost frowned on when managing. I know some company to work for right. 

Guess I’m trying to see if anyone feels like I do in which the more disciplined I become with physical and mental training, diet/nutrition and work ethic, the more I’m struggling with being at that place and around those people.

It might just be me going crazy and I don’t want to make myself sound like the perfect person. I’m not. I’m damn better than I was years ago however and am proud of my progress but obviously still have a lot to learn and more adversity lined up in the future. (I’m 23 btw).

On top of this there was an extra $320 dollars changed for gratuity. is this normal? I tipped the gentlemen who cleaned our room $100 the day we left the ship because we was very friendly and would always open our cabin door when he saw me carrying one of my kids.

After that, he started acting rude, but we still agreed to keep it casual. 

A few weeks later, I went to a techno gig, and he messaged me saying he was there and told me to come see him. We hooked up, but since then, he’s been passive-aggressive, making comments like, “All I am is meat to you,” and just being a jerk. It didn’t make sense because we’d both agreed it was casual. I got fed up with his behaviour and removed him on social media.

Room was large and spacious. Breakfast that came with it was good. My problem has to do with the cleanliness of the room.

The bathroom toilet seat had hair and yellow urine spots from the previous guest. Called the front desk and asked them to send housekeeping. 30 minutes pass and nobody showed up. Girlfriend went to the desk to say something again. They showed up this time 5 minutes later and “cleaned” the bathroom in a few seconds. After going back to the toilet, the very hair and urine stain we complained about were still there. We had them come back and had to basically point it out. Girlfriend ended up taking some of the cleaning solution and paper towel so we can do our own cleaning.

This led to us looking a little more carefully than we normally do. Hair was in the sink. Hair on the lotion bottle hanging on the wall, soap bar marks on the soap holder, soap stains on the floor. Drops of coffee or something on the floor near the kitchen. 

I have pictures of all of this that can be submitted with the complaint as well. Just not of the toilet seat as I didn’t think of it until after the fact. 

Question is basically in the title. Who is the best to reach out to for this type of complaint? The stay is over and they didn’t have any other rooms available to switch us out. ",0,1733798494.0,Hilton,2,0.5,False

1hark64,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1hark64/struggling_with_jealousy_i_guess_in_my/,Struggling with jealousy (I guess?) in my bestfriendship,"Hi All!
I (early 20s F) am having a problem involving my relationship with my best friend (also early 20s F). We have been friends for over 5 years and currently live together.
My issue is I struggle with jealousy in regards to our upbringing, and living with her has made it worse.

To make a VERY long story short, my entire family sucks, and I have next to no support system, I never have. My family has sucked since long before I was born, and something about me makes them act worse. My family has always been upper low class/VERY low middle class. I grew up very poor, sharing 1 bedroom with my 2 opposite sex siblings, my mom was single and worked 2 jobs, pantry was always next to empty, etc. I had a very rough go of it due to my financial limitations and my family's views and beliefs of what made a good kid.

My best friend on the other hand, has almost never dealt with anything like that in her life. When she was extremely young, her mother was single and not doing well financially, but they quickly found their footing and have been more than financially stable for well over a decade. Her general family is also extremely well off. She spent most of her childhood VERY high middle class/ lower high class. Her family is very bonded to each other, and they go very far out of their way to care and love each other. 
It is SUCH a foreign concept to me... 

Ever since moving in together, its painfully obvious how different our financial circumstances were. I moved in with a dining table and coffee table I purchased from FB marketplace that were falling apart, and any and all of my kitchen gear I thrifted. The same goes for all of my clothes, all of my bedroom furniture, my decor, I purchased it all myself. I've also done nothing but work full time since I began senior year.

She on the other hand, purchased next to nothing to prepare for move in. Her family gave her anything and everything she may need. Real wood antique furniture sets, armoires, boxes and boxes of kitchen supplies, large mirrors and paintings. Almost all of the furniture in the shared spaces is hers, and she still has additional furniture and boxes in her grandparents storage unit. She was able to go to school, and worked on and off part time until very recently, when she dropped out of school, got a certificate, and now works full time.

With the holidays rolling around, it's been especially hard to try to stifle my jealousy(?). She came home with 3 full boxes of just Christmas ornaments and decorations she and her family have collected over the years. Expensive glass baubles with intricate designs, ceramic scenes, and every ornament she made as a kid. I have nothing. I don't have a single ornament I made as a kid, I don't have a single piece of decor. nothing.

I have VERY severe anxiety, so I'm usually overly critical as a person. I don't mean to be, but that is how I show my love as that is how I was shown love when I was young. It's very hard for me to be excited about Christmas, a holiday focused almost entirely on family. She loves christmas, and her family has so many traditions and things they do for the holidays. And whenever she shows me her trips or the new advent calander they purchased her, it's so incredibly hard for me to be excited or happy, because it just reminds me I will never have photos like that. 

I fully recognize this is an issue within myself and I do what I can to silence that critical part of myself but, I just wish she would try to keep in mind that myself and my fiance (who is also living with us) have very, very poor associations with the holidays. For us, the holidays are a reminder of all that we never had as kids and all that we'll never have as adults. It really really sucks, but at this stage in life, we're both still very much processing and unblocking those traumas. 

I don't really know my exact reason for posting, maybe just to feel heard. Apologies for this being vague, trying to maintain privacy. Please leave any advice you may have.

Thank you!

EDIT: I say ""I guess"" in the title as I'm not 100% sure what to call it, please leave advice in that regard as well if you have any",1,1733798273.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

I was 115-125 my whole adult life, until I was 28 and started an antidepressant that caused weight gain and got up to 150-155 in the span of 3-4 months. I quit the antidepressant, but gained more weight during Covid and was up to 175lbs when I moved to NYC in June of 2022. The walking lifestyle helped a lot, and I got down to 160 without much effort in the first year (April 2023). 

Then, I had a manic episode last summer where I was drinking a lot but eating very little, and got down to 145 by August 2023. I cut way back on drinking and maintained this weight until I started an antipsychotic  that causes weight gain in December 2023 (I have bi-polar type 2). 

I then broke + sprained my ankle badly and couldn't walk for 6 weeks in January 2024, had a major depressive episode in the spring, and started drinking more again until August 2024, when I took a break from drinking entirely for a few months. I didn't weigh myself for basically all of 2024, but I'm pretty sure I definitely got back to 160 by the end of August, if not higher.

THEN - I started a dedicated fitness journey Nov. 17th of this year (not quite a month ago). I began going to the gym every day (except a few when I traveled for a weekend and was sick for a couple days) and getting in 8-10k steps/day. 

Since I'm new to working out, I've been doing a simple routine - started with 15, then 30, and now 40 min of cardio (cycle, elliptical, or treadmill), and pretty basic strength training:

* Shoulder press, (start 10lbs, now 20lbs), 3 sets of 15
* Abdominal crunch, (start 30lbs, now 50lbs), 3 sets of 15
* Seated leg press, (start 60lbs, now 85lbs), 3 sets of 15
* Bicep curls, 10lbs, 3 sets of 10
* Lat pull-downs, 30lbs, 3 sets of 10

I didn't weigh myself before I started, unfortunately - if I did I might realize I actually made some small progress. I weighed in Dec. 3rd at 159lbs, and then today Dec. 9th - still at 159lbs...

I use MFP and have a goal of 1200cal. If I exercise, it says I'm allowed an additional 180-300 cal depending on the day. I try not to eat back all of this, but I do 2-3x week. I no longer have a drink every day, and on the days I do (3 days a week max), it's 1-2 instead of 3-5+. 

I typically don't eat until 1pm aside from coffee w/oat milk, have a 500-600 cal lunch, a 200cal protein bar as a snack, and a smaller dinner (usually 300-400 cal), or honestly sometimes skip dinner and have maybe a few saltines if I'm not very hungry. I count any alcohol calories I consume.

Anyway, there have definitely been some days where I've eaten back all of my exercise calories plus 100-200 more, and I've had 2-3 cheat days since starting this, but still never consumed more than 1800 calories on those days. I also quit the meds causing weight gain (planned with my doctor), started tapering Nov. 10th and have been completely off of them since Nov. 25.

I can definitely tell I'm getting stronger, I'm able to lift more and spend more time doing cardio, and feel better overall, so this is progress I'm happy about. 

I know I'm not perfect, BUT-- I would think I would have seen more than 1-2 lbs of weight loss by now, almost a month later. Well, it's been 3 weeks I guess, so maybe I'm expecting too much. My body doesn't look much different than when I began. I also could have been closer 163-165lbs when I started but my scale didn't have batteries until recently, so who knows, haha.

This subreddit has been so inspiring, and I would just love some advice/reassurance - am I starting off on the right foot? Am I building a little muscle, which weighs more than fat so maybe this is why I'm not shedding pounds? Am I expecting too much too soon? Do I probably need more time for the medication to exit my system and stop affecting my metabolism? I lost weight so quickly last summer, but I was basically starving myself and I also wasn't on the weight-gain antipsychotic. 

I'm trying to do things the right way this time! I'm so proud of myself for starting the gym habit, but while I'm nearly positive I'm not going to give up, I feel a little at risk of getting discouraged and stopping, or not going nearly as frequently. Any tips on gym routine or eating habits are so very much appreciated. Thank you for reading!",2,1733797941.0,PetiteFitness,0,1.0,False

The village outside Quezon City was exactly as she'd described it – lush, humid, with houses nestled between banana trees and birds of paradise. What she hadn't mentioned was the emptiness. No children playing in the streets, no neighbors chatting across fences. Even the stray dogs kept their distance from the family home, though I swore I could hear them howling at night, their cries cutting off abruptly mid-wail.

Her mother, Elena, greeted me with an embrace that made my skin prickle. She held me too long, her nose tracing a line from my collar to my ear, inhaling deeply. I felt like a wine being sampled, assessed for its bouquet.

""Welcome, James,"" she said, her accent thick but her English perfect. ""We've heard so much about you."" Behind her stood Susannah's grandmother and two aunts, all of them tall and elegant like my girlfriend, with the same high cheekbones and unusual amber eyes. They watched me with an intensity that made my skin crawl, like cats tracking a wounded bird. Later, I would understand they were watching to see if the change had begun.

Those first few days, I noticed my sense of smell growing sharper. Every morning and evening, they prepared elaborate meals – always insisting on serving me themselves, always watching me eat with those predatory smiles. The meat had a strange, gamey flavor I couldn't place, and sometimes I could swear it was still warm, as if it had been alive moments before reaching my plate. Each bite made me feel stranger, more alert, more... hungry.

My gums started to ache. My back itched constantly, especially at night. When I looked in the mirror, my own eyes seemed different – darker, with flecks of amber starting to bloom in the irises. I blamed it on jet lag, on the unfamiliar food, on anything but what it really was.

The house itself seemed alive at night. The locked cellar door that no one would discuss. The way the local villagers crossed themselves when we passed by. The strange, coppery smell that permeated the halls after sunset, like old pennies or fresh blood. And the sounds – God, the sounds. Wet, slithering noises in the walls, scratching above the ceiling, and sometimes, what sounded like distant screaming. My new heightened senses made it all unbearable.

It was on the fifth night that my own transformation began. I was following Susannah, my curiosity finally overwhelming my growing dread. The moon was full, casting everything in a sickly white light. From my window, I watched her walk into the banana grove behind the house, her white nightgown ghostly against the dark foliage. She stopped in a clearing and began to twitch.

The sight should have horrified me. Instead, I felt a deep resonance, as if my own body was remembering something ancient and terrible. I watched, transfixed, as a wet, tearing sound split the night – like someone ripping apart raw chicken. Susannah's torso separated from her waist, intestines dangling like obscene ribbons, glistening in the moonlight. Wings erupted from her back in a spray of dark fluid, unfurling like some hellish butterfly emerging from its chrysalis. When she turned, her face was no longer human. Her jaw had distended, filled with rows of needle-sharp teeth, and her eyes glowed like hot coals in a dead fire.

My own spine cracked audibly as I watched. The itching in my back had become unbearable, and I could feel something moving beneath my skin, pressing outward. I stumbled backward, knocking over a vase, and the crash brought instant silence, then the sound of wings.

Susannah floated through my window, her intestines swaying gently like seaweed in a current. Behind her, three more figures rose into view – her mother, grandmother, and aunt, all in the same horrific state of bifurcation. Their lower halves stood like empty clothes in the clearing, while their torsos floated on massive, leathery wings. The air filled with that chittering laughter I'd been hearing in my dreams – the same sound that had been building in my own throat.

""The change is already starting,"" she said, her voice a raspy version of its usual melody. ""We've been feeding you our essence for days. In our saliva, in our food, in every kiss. We're mananangal, aswang, the hungry ones. It runs in the family, passed from mother to daughter... and sometimes, to those we choose to keep.""

Through the window, I could see her family members floating in the yard, their eyes burning in the darkness. Elena called out, ""The final transformation must be shared through a ritual as old as these islands. Not all survive it, of course, but Susannah thinks you're strong enough. The fact that you're still alive after drinking our essence proves it.""

""I don't want to lose you,"" Susannah whispered, her inhuman face inches from mine. ""And I don't want to have to kill you. Please don't make me choose. You're already halfway there – can't you feel it?""

I could. My teeth were lengthening, pushing outward. The skin along my spine was splitting, and I could feel something wet and membranous trying to spread. I looked at her clawed hand, then at her face – that strange mixture of the woman I loved and something ancient and horrifying. Two years of love and trust warred with primal terror. But then I remembered all the little things that now made sense: her strange hours, her intense protectiveness, the way she always seemed to know when danger was near. The way small animals disappeared whenever she visited me in the States.

Something moved in the cellar window – a pale face pressed against the glass, mouth open in a silent scream. I thought of the missing villagers, the strange meat at dinner, the screams in the night. Yet even that knowledge didn't repulse me anymore. Instead, I felt a new hunger stirring.

""What happens now?"" I asked, my voice changing even as I spoke, becoming something inhuman.

She smiled, revealing rows of teeth that went far too far back into her head. ""Now we complete what we started. The ritual requires... preparation. And I'm sure you must be very hungry by now.""

As she led me outside to her waiting family, my skin began to split along my waist. Had I made a terrible mistake? Or was I about to become something magnificent and terrible? Either way, as Susannah's family circled above me like vultures, their wings blotting out the stars, I realized it was far too late to change my mind.

In the distance, a rooster crowed, but dawn seemed impossibly far away. Susannah's grandmother descended, carrying something that writhed in her clawed hands. The smell of fresh meat made my new teeth ache with anticipation.

""Let's begin,"" she said, her voice thick with hunger. ""And remember, dear James – try to scream quietly. We wouldn't want to wake the neighbors. Though soon enough, you'll be the one doing the hunting.""

As they closed in around me, their shadows merging into one, I couldn't tell if the pounding I heard was my heart or drums from the village – a death knell or a celebration. Perhaps both. Susannah's eyes met mine, filled with equal parts love and predatory anticipation, and I realized that sometimes love means not just accepting all parts of someone, but becoming something entirely new yourself.

The transformation was already burning through my body like acid in my veins. Whether this rebirth would be my salvation or destruction remained to be seen. But as my spine began to split and wings pushed through my shoulders, I found myself smiling with teeth that were no longer my own.",3,1733797347.0,nosleep,3,1.0,False

I tried keto before and it melted my weight in just 2 weeks, reached my goal in two weeks time. Really not fat back then just trying to slim down.

Now 6 years later at 30, at 177.5 pounds with hormonal imbalance, probably insulin resistance. I tried everything that used to work when I was younger, and all is not working this time. From portion control, fasting, walking for an hour, cardio, weights, lowering down my cortisol & making sure I sleep 8-9 hours. 

My weight just wont drop, not even 1 kilo. My waist will fluctuate between 35-36 inch but that's it. This has been going on for 3 years since I had hormonal imbalance. The thing is I can easily go up but never down. 😞 

So my last hope is keto but it's not working the same. Back then I'll be in ketosis by the third day, and will lose 2-3 kilos a few days in.

 It's now day 6 and I have not experienced keto flu yet, have not lost even a pound, even my measurements are the same if not more. Have not experienced water loss either, which seems everyone of you have experience.

I do exactly what I did back then, no processed food, or keto treats. Just meat, chicken, eggs. I will have black coffee with full cream, a teaspoon of coconut oil and one gram of equal gold. I might have a cucumber, or a tomato every other day but that's just it. This is my diet on repeat. I'm a little dirty keto, like the first time I did it but  I'm sure I don't go over 20g of carbs a day.

My supposed to be intake is 1450 calories but I'm quite sure I'm not even reaching that because I'm not hungry. I only it twice with 1-2 coffees a day, no snacks. I naturally fast more than 12 hours.

I don't know what's happening I'm panicking now. Keto is my last resort. If keto will not work I don't know what else will. I'm very frustrated right now.",2,1733797140.0,xxketo,2,1.0,False
1har6bb,https://www.reddit.com/r/healingspirit/comments/1har6bb/navigating_loss_how_grief_changes_relationships/,Navigating Loss: How Grief Changes Relationships and Seven Ways to Rebuild Connections,"Introduction:
 When a partner dies, or a marriage ends in divorce, the changes in our relationships often extend far beyond the immediate absence of that person. Friendships can take on new forms, as some people might not know how to support you or might feel uncomfortable confronting the rawness of your grief. Others may unexpectedly step forward, offering a depth of understanding and empathy you didn’t anticipate. These shifts can feel destabilizing, as the loss you’re experiencing isn’t limited to your partner but ripples out into the network of connections that once surrounded you. How you relate to others, and even yourself, can feel unfamiliar and sometimes isolating.
Family relationships, too, can undergo significant change during these times. For some, family may become a critical source of comfort and stability, stepping in to fill emotional and practical voids. However, for others, family dynamics may grow strained as differing perspectives on grief, divorce, or the responsibilities that come with loss emerge. You might find yourself questioning the roles you once played in your family or feeling the weight of expectations that don’t align with your healing process. Navigating these complexities requires patience with others and a commitment to honoring your needs as you rebuild your life.
One of the most profound shifts occurs in your relationship with yourself. Losing a partner through death or divorce often challenges your sense of identity, leaving you to reevaluate who you are without the defining presence of that person in your life. Questions about your future, priorities, and even your sense of self-worth can arise in ways you may not have anticipated. This daunting and transformative journey allows you to rediscover parts of yourself that may have been overshadowed. While the path can feel overwhelming, it also holds the promise of resilience and renewal, allowing you to forge old and new relationships on a foundation of authenticity and mutual understanding.

 
1. Shifting Priorities in Friendships
Think about your closest friends before your loss. Were they the ones you laughed with over shared memories, who knew every part of your daily life? Now, you might notice a gap—a silence where there was once constant chatter. After losing a partner, your priorities naturally change. Conversations or gatherings that once brought joy might now feel hollow, and some friendships may drift.
But here’s the thing: friendships can be rekindled. I remember a friend telling me how she hesitated to call her closest confidant after her husband’s passing. “I didn’t know what to say,” she admitted. Yet when she finally picked up the phone, her friend confessed, “I didn’t know if you wanted to talk to me.” That simple moment of honesty healed months of misunderstanding.
What can you do? Start small. Send a text saying, “I miss you,” or invite them for coffee. Open up about how your priorities have shifted and ask for their patience. Sometimes, friends need guidance on how to be there for you.
 
2. Family Roles and Expectations Evolve
Family. They’re the ones we expect to be there no matter what. But grief can complicate even these bonds. Maybe your sister calls more often, expecting you to open up while you feel drained and unable to share. Or perhaps a cousin you barely spoke to now wants to step in as your primary support system, leaving you overwhelmed.
I remember one woman I spoke with whose family insisted she host the next holiday gathering, as her late husband always did. “I didn’t want to disappoint them,” she said, “but I couldn’t bear the thought of filling his shoes.” In moments like these, it’s okay to draw boundaries. Grief changes what you’re capable of, and families must adjust, too.
What worked for her? She talked to her family, explaining what she could and couldn’t do. Instead of hosting the gathering, she suggested they all meet at a restaurant. She honored her limits and their desire to stay connected by proposing an alternative.
 
3. Strained Romantic Relationships
If you’ve begun exploring new romantic relationships after loss, you might have discovered how complicated this path can be. There’s no roadmap for loving again while carrying the weight of grief. For some, new relationships bring guilt—""Am I moving on too quickly?” Others find it hard to open up to a partner who didn’t know their late spouse.
A dear friend once shared her struggle with this. She met someone wonderful years after her husband’s death but found herself hesitating to talk about her grief. “I didn’t want him to feel like he was competing with a ghost,” she said. Yet when she finally shared her feelings, her partner surprised her by saying, “I want to know every part of you, even the hard parts.”
The lesson here? Vulnerability can strengthen new love. If you’re feeling stuck, consider counseling to navigate these emotions together. Love doesn’t replace grief—it grows alongside it.
 
4. Isolation from Social Circles
Grief has a way of pulling us inward. It’s as if the world keeps spinning while you’re frozen, struggling to catch your breath. I’ve heard countless people say, “I feel like my friends have forgotten me.” And while that may feel true, often the reality is different: they’re unsure how to help or fear saying the wrong thing.
I know someone who sent a simple message to her friends: “I’m struggling, and I’d love your company. Could we have dinner together next week?” That gesture brought her friends back into her life, and she realized they had been waiting for her signal.
Reconnecting takes courage, but it’s worth it. Reach out with a specific invitation or suggestion, like a movie night or a walk. Your friends want to support you—they need to know how.
 
5. Navigating Work Relationships
Returning to work after a loss can feel like stepping into another world. Colleagues might avoid you, unsure of what to say, or worse, bombard you with questions that feel invasive. It’s common to feel like your grief has become an unspoken elephant in the room.
One man I knew shared how his boss’s casual comment—""You’re back now, so everything’s okay, right?”—left him reeling. “I didn’t know how to respond,” he admitted. Eventually, he found his voice, explaining to his manager, “Grief doesn’t end—it evolves. I’m here, but I’m still healing.” That honest conversation reshaped their dynamic.
If you’re navigating work relationships, remember that you set the tone. Share what you’re comfortable with and keep professional boundaries intact. At the same time, don’t hesitate to lean on colleagues who offer genuine support.
 
6. Spiritual Relationships May Deepen or Shift
Loss has a way of shaking our spiritual foundations. Some people find solace in their faith, while others question everything they once believed. A woman I met at a grief support group described how she had stopped attending church after her husband’s death. “I felt betrayed by God,” she said. Yet she found a new sense of spirituality over time through meditation and quiet reflection.
Your spiritual journey is yours alone. If traditional practices no longer resonate, explore alternative paths—yoga, mindfulness, or joining a different faith community. And if you find comfort in your beliefs, lean into them with others who share your perspective.
 
7. Developing a New Sense of Independence
Finally, grief often forces us to grow in ways we never anticipated. You may find yourself handling tasks your partner once took care of, from managing finances to fixing a leaky faucet. This newfound independence can be empowering but isolating, as it changes how you relate to others.
One widow I spoke with described feeling proud and lonely after learning to handle her household independently. “I miss having someone to share the load with,” she confessed. Her solution? Joining a volunteer group, she met others who understood her journey and appreciated her skills.
Independence doesn’t mean going it alone. Surround yourself with supportive people who celebrate your growth while offering companionship.
 
Conclusion:
 
Grief reshapes how we interact with the world, not just with the person we’ve lost but with everyone around us. In moments of profound loss, it’s easy to feel like life is happening to you, as though you’re a passive participant in the shifting tides of relationships. However, it’s important to remember that you can take control of these changes. While others may not always know how to treat you in your new circumstances, you can help guide them by being honest about your needs and boundaries. Even when it feels vulnerable, communication can pave the way for understanding and connection.
Taking small, intentional steps can make all the difference in nurturing your relationships during this time. Reach out to those who matter most to you, even if it feels awkward or unfamiliar. Invite a friend for coffee or join a support group where people understand the emotions you’re navigating. These gestures may seem small, but they are potent acts of reclaiming your agency and building a community that aligns with the person you are becoming. At the same time, permit yourself to let go of relationships that no longer serve you, recognizing that not every connection will survive the transformations brought on by grief.
Healing is not a solo journey—it’s a shared process that thrives in the presence of understanding and support. By fostering open communication and intentional reconnection, you rebuild relationships and discover new depths of resilience within yourself. People may not always get it right when approaching you during this vulnerable time, but by showing grace and guiding them honestly, you create space for mutual growth. Your grief may have altered your relationships, but it’s also an opportunity to deepen and redefine them to honor who you are now.


Call to Action:
Have you noticed friends or family distancing themselves since your loss? If you wish to reconnect, what steps will you take? Please share your thoughts in the comments, and let’s support one another in this journey.
 

A Prayer for the Newly Single and Their Community of Support.

 Loving God, We come to You with hearts full of trust and hope, knowing that You see the brokenness and loneliness that often accompanies those newly single. Lord, You know their hearts, their struggles, and the burdens they carry. We ask that You wrap them in Your boundless love and comfort, reminding them they are never truly alone, for You walk with them through every season of life.
Heavenly God, grant them guidance as they navigate this new chapter. Help them to see Your hand in every step they take, leading them toward healing, growth, and the blessings You have prepared for their future. Teach them to lean on You for strength and to trust in Your plan, even when the path ahead feels uncertain or overwhelming.
Lord, we also pray for the friends and family of those who are newly single. Stir within them a spirit of compassion and unwavering support. Help them to see the needs of their loved ones, to listen with open hearts, and to show kindness in both small and significant ways. May they become a reflection of Your love, offering encouragement and companionship to those who need it most.
Father, remind us all of the power of community, the beauty of friendship, and the sacred responsibility we have to care for one another. May those who feel alone find solace in the relationships You have placed in their lives, and may those around them be vessels of Your grace and mercy.
We lift this prayer to You, trusting Your divine wisdom and infinite care. In Jesus' name, we pray. Amen.

Anyway I went to a meet up 2 weeks ago at a cafe. It was mostly ppl I already knew, some I didn’t. This guy I hadn’t met was there named Justin. He was talking to another girl about a Facebook witch group and I asked him to add me to it. He couldn’t find me on fb (I have it locked down) so I was like no prob, I’ll add you. Big mistake. As the evening went on, it became more and more obvious that this guy was extremely annoying (wouldn’t shut up, poor social skills, oversharing, an obvious desperation for closeness, making fun of me for how I talk). So he messaged me later about this event I mentioned to him and I sent it to him thinking that would be the end of it. Then he replied and I didn’t open the message, in fact I just deleted it. Then he messaged me again and I saw something about “dont want to make assumptions” so I opened it. It was something like “?. I don’t want to make assumptions, maybe you’re just busy and couldn’t respond to my last message.” The message was gone and I didn’t know what he was talking about so I just left him on read. Then today he sends me some thing about how we’re adults, I shouldn’t leave him on read, he thought that the coffee meet up was for making friends and I was making him feel like he was being weird. It pissed me off so I said “you are being weird lol, I’m a busy adult. Blocking you, bye” and followed suit. 
I probably should’ve just replied the first or second time he messaged me, but I really hate this sense of entitlement with basically strangers to reply right away. It really sets me off when I don’t know someone and it’s always guys who do this shit.  I thought I had made my peace with the annoying ppl in the group or knew where to avoid them, now I need to avoid another place lol. ",3,1733796996.0,rs_x,6,0.64,False

Then it came a couple times a year and she ignored it. Then every couple months. Then a couple times a month. Then a couple times a week.

Then the doctor went on vacation, and my mother wasn’t able to resume tests until January when her deductible reset. The tests showed severe neuropathy. The $180,000 surgery would have had no effect. They prescribed opioids for the pain. At first the pain relief was worth the price of constant mental fog and constipation. She didn’t tell me about that until later. All I remember is we took a trip for the first time in years, when she drove me to Monterey to go to the aquarium. I saw an otter in real life, swimming on its back. We left at 7am and listened to Green Day on the four-hour car ride. Over time, the opioids stopped working. They made her MORE sensitive to pain, and she felt withdrawal symptoms after just two or three hours.

1haquse,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1haquse/aitah_for_not_wanting_to_date_my_coworkers_son/,AITAH for not wanting to date my coworker’s son ,"
okay. so…
i work in a school. i am in a behavioral support position and i work closely with the main office staff and administrators.
about a year ago, one of the secretaries approached another staff member i am close with outside of the job and said that her son had seen a photo of me on facebook and called me his “dream girl”. she asked that friend of mine how I would feel about being set up with someone. my friend told her that I would hate that, that I don’t date, it has never been my thing, and basically that I don’t shit where I eat anyway.
the secretary then asked me about the following day and I said the same thing. she asked, can i at least leave you with his phone number in case you change your mind and i said yes that’s ok, because i didn’t want to say no (i know, my boundary setting in this situation was not good and only gets worse but i truly was trying my very best. i am practicing).
this was last december. i became close (in a coworkers sense) with this woman, kind of developing a “work mom” type relationship with her. i’m realizing in hindsight that i should have seen the rest of this coming and kept my standard coworker arms length distance with her. but, i did share some vague things with her about my past experiences that have shaped me as well as my current perspectives on life matters as these things came up in conversation that felt casual at the time. i know, and i see my mistake there. for the remainder of last school year it was hardly mentioned, in passing once or twice but it was passive and seemed to be in a bit of a joking manner so i didn’t have an opinion on it for a long time.

this school year, things have been different.
she started by just mentioning it to me more often. each time, i told her that i was not interested in dating to begin with, that i don’t want to date anyone related to anyone i work with, and that i am not interested in pursuing her son.
this fall, she had a “psychic party” with a couple of coworkers. now, do i believe in the idea of a ‘psychic’? sure. why not? do i believe that people who you can pay to come to your house and read a bunch of your friend’s palms are legitimate? no shot. but, i am trying to be more social this year and i enjoyed the company of the people who would be there and so i agreed and i went.
her son was there.
after my “reading” (done by a strange man who told me i should not be reading tarot “for myself” and sexually harassed all of us for the entirety of the night), she said she wanted to “talk to me outside”. she asked me questions like did he say i was going to be married or have kids etc. and i told her he said i was going to have two kids (I don’t want kids, never have, have always been vocal about it). Before i could make a second remark about his suggestion that i’d have kids, she made this excited sound and put her hand over her mouth and acted a bit weird for a minute. in hindsight, i am willing to bet that he “told” her son that he would have two kids as well. i also have no doubt in my mind that she told this “psychic” that she wanted to set us up together and that this “psychic” used that info to his advantage as she was his long standing client, apparently. while we were outside, her son came out to speak with us and at one point she turned to head back inside and i immediately followed her; the son seemed to have expected me to stay outside but eventually did follow us back in.
at that point i was working my way up to heading out. i sat on the kitchen floor to pet their dogs and the son came and sat with me and we talked, just about the dogs. it was very casual conversation and the son himself did not make me uncomfortable per se, i just don’t want to DATE the kid. anyway, everyone was in the living room apparently gossiping about the “love birds” in the kitchen.

anyway.
that was october.
since then things have been escalating. more comments, and she has even gone as far as “giving me permission to fuck him” (because i said while asking them to stop: ‘i don’t like to date i like to have sex and go home’), and telling me that she “happens to know that both of her sons are well endowed”. things that i would never want to hear about anybody, much less their mother. things someone’s mother should never be saying and things she should never be doing.

my bosses have both joined in at this point.
the head principal has done far less than the assistant principal but he has made comments. one day the son was visiting his mom (i know) at the office and was in the principals office talking with him - because he visits his moms work often enough to be friendly with the staff. that is strange to me. anyway, i had to walk into his office to hand him a drink from a group order we had placed. there was a brief exchange, i left, had to go back in for one more quick moment and then went back to the assistant principal’s office where we were all getting food from the order to the right people and sitting down to eat and talk.
a while later, the principal walks into the office and makes a comment. he says “i don’t usually do this and i want to stay out of it but i will just say this” and mentions that he thinks that the son was there “hoping for a chance encounter” with me and that there was “undeniable tension” in the office when we were both in there. the tension that he is speaking of was 100% there, its called discomfort and “i want to get out of here without having to engage with this guy”.
then they all started in.
he has not said anything about it to me since.
the assistant principal however, has. she and the secretary whose son is in question have both escalated to the point of telling me that i don’t want to date him because i am “self sabotaging” and “afraid to let myself be happy”. this is an insane sentiment to me after i have spent the last year telling them repeatedly that i don’t like to date because i am perfectly happy and i don’t feel like my life is lacking anything for not having a romantic partner or connection. i don’t feel a lack of love. i don’t feel lonely. i am not unhappy. they have heard that and basically told me that i’m wrong, and that i have to give it a shot and they have insisted that he may surprise me.
well, after so long, i started to doubt myself. i started to think maybe they are right and i am wrong. she told me that he asked me to coffee and i declined and i said absolutely not, he never asked me that. she left work that day and 20 mins later he sent me a message asking me to coffee. like that isn’t all incredibly weird. i panicked. but i decided that at least, i can go to coffee and have a nice cup of coffee and then i can tell them okay, i tried it like you asked and it is still not for me. please dont ask again.

i went for that coffee yesterday. it wasn’t awful; he is a nice enough guy, for somebody else. very very not my type for a myriad of reasons; all reasons which i saw coming and told them are reasons i did not want to pursue.

anyway, he asked if i would like to go again and i let him down very kindly and gently and told him that i hope we can still be cool with each other if we see one another and i hope he can understand. i repeated everything i’ve been saying this whole time; dating has never been a priority for me and i am not looking to change that. “it’s not you it’s me” without saying that and also, genuinely that decision is about me far more than it is about him. his response was a simple “All good”, which I can’t be bothered with worrying if he means that or not. I’m worried, however, that since he seems to have such an insanely enmeshed relationship with his mother, that I will have to deal with either hostility or more pushy behavior after this.
I’m hoping for advice on how to proceed if anybody brings this up to me beyond me telling them that I tried and I am still not interested. I am feeling very disrespected and backed into a corner here. I feel as though these women want the satisfaction of an “I told you so” or a feeling that they “got us together”. I think they are struggling to wrap their minds around a 26 year old woman being genuinely fulfilled with no significant other or romantic love life at all. I think that they want this kid to “get his dream girl”. I think the secretary wants to be my mother in law. I think she wants her son out of her house and she knows he won’t leave until he is in a relationship / another woman’s responsibility. I am struggling to understand what in the world they want for ME, as i’ve told them what *I want for me* and they have been just telling me that I am wrong.

I know how I plan to respond verbally, and I know how I plan to operate going forward to place that boundary and keep it there. I am looking for advice in preparation I guess. If anything continues, what in the world do I do? I have a unique position and transferring to another building is not an option. If the environment becomes too hostile I will have to choose not to return next school year, but I will have to get through the next 6 months without becoming unprofessional about this.

Like my worry is what if he’s been talking to one of them and I swoop in and screw up his chances with her. I think I overthink a bit but I need insight.

From replacing long neglected and dead fan motors and belts, to effecting chronic pain points in the various other systems, we have finally reached a point we can turn to regular scheduled stuff on the back burner. 

Since I’ve been there, occasional complaints arise concerning trash/sewage odors. Despite the HK team regularly emptying the large steel bins and mopping the trash room, always an odor. 

Lead HK guy comes to me late morning asking for help with one of the compactors. It wasn’t cycling properly. We’ve got a backup three floors and climbing; People are tossing the evening garbage on the way to work. Rolly bin isn’t even half full. I haven’t even finished morning coffee after doing the routine roof inspections and I’m already digging through fœtid scraps and diapers. I find the scraper plate which slides along the top of the piston has dislocated, torqued, cracked a weld, and dropped behind it; Allowing garbage to slowly accumulate and get packed inside around the hydraulic rams. Over what seemed to be years. It had been decomposing in the base of the compactor compartment, repeatedly compressed and packed into the impossible recesses of the machine. Goop of a soup of poop, coffee grounds, wine-soaked tablecloths, chicken bones, diapers (adult and child) stale beer cans, glass…yummy. I’m surprised I didn’t find a section of the Burgess Shale down there!

I think I have to control my temperature better to get a more consistent fermentation but it doesn't taste like there's much sugar in this beer at all. Also all my fermentations for this recipe have ended at high gravity, the lowest I ever got was 1.036

Recipe:
[  ] 5kg 2row
[  ] 375g roasted barley 
[  ] 250g light crystal malt (12oz)
[  ] 750g chocolate malt(12oz)
[  ] 375g coffee malt

[  ] 500g flaked oats
[  ] 1 oz east Kent golding @ 15 mins
[  ] Yeast DCL (s-05)
[  ] 500g lactose @ 10mins

Obviously the lactose adds unfermentable gravity but it should be only an additional .010 SG. This batch also tastes the driest out of any I've made, but it finished with the highest gravity.

Ladies and gents this is the moment we've been waiting for (insert greatest showman track)

# DeskThing v0.10 is live!! 

*\*I may nickname this the Personal Update\**



It has passed the first wave of testing and I am now pretty happy with how its turned out! A quick overview of changes:



**Client**

* Onboarding
   *  On first boot, you are prompted with a series of questions to make DeskThing yours! Colors, sizes, positions, etc!
* Button Mapping
   *  You can have icons for actions and maps for buttons! This will let you make any button press do any action! (swiping = shuffle? Go for it)
* Weapon Wheel Selection (4 more buttons to map to anything)
* Better app switching
* Better performance
* Dynamic apps
* Dashboard
* Better clock handling



I basically recoded the entire app (I literally just deleted the old app) - idk what more you want from here XD



\### Server

 Button mappings!

* Button Mappings!
   * Create profiles
   * Copy Profiles
   * Set an action to any key
   * Set values to keys
* Reactivity
   * You can smol deskthing now
*  Better error handling
   * Hopefully you'll see less errors! 
*  Improved caching of various resources
*  Improved routing
*  Better launch performance
*  Various other bugfixes (I know i fixed more - cant remember right now) 
*  More app settings!
   * Multiselect
   * List
   * Ranked
   * Range
   * Color
   * Text
   * Number
   * Boolean
   * All of these mean apps can be far more specific abt user input! (good thing) 
* Plus a lot of other QOL changes I never got to!



\## Upgrading from v0.9.2

\- Purge all of your apps

\- Close deskthing fully (use task mananger or Quit after right clicking the taskbar icon)

\- Download the installer from [https://deskthing.app](https://deskthing.app)

\- Run the installer

\- Go to the Downloads tab and then the Clients sub-tab (its a dropdown)

\- Click ""Download Latest""

\- Go to the Clients -> Connections tab and hit Details next to your car thing

\- Hit ""Push Staged""

\- Reinstall all of your apps

To quote the great Captain Jean Luc Picard “It is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose. That is not a weakness; that is life.”

My first ER, I tried very hard. I warned my manager I'd slack off at work, I ate right, I walked, I napped. We got 2 euploid embryos from 34 eggs (Thanks PCOS). I was pleased! 

A year and one miscarriage later I did ER2 in the middle of a 3+ month work stress fest, in agony from endometriosis, and just... in survival mode. Barely sleeping, barely eating. Stuck to low carb due to fear of OHSS alone. Found out today we got 8 euploid from 30 eggs! (Yes, I am ecstatic, but not my point.) 

Maybe (likely) it was the omnitrope or estrogen priming changes to my protocol. Maybe it was the Yin yoga I periodically visited all summer. Maybe it was something my partner did. We will never know. 

I'm not telling anyone not to make the lifestyle changes (drink less, sleep more, reduce inflammation, etc). It can't hurt. It probably helps a little. 

But if you're worried that you slipped up today because you stayed up reading or missed a workout or had a coffee or whatever and it will ruin everything....maybe not.

","Background: So I  got dumped by my ex around a year and a half ago. I didn't have health insurance, I was having gallbladder attacks, and I was working a job that sucked the life out of me. He blew up on me one day because he does to much for me (felt like he was my parent) and I'm too dependant on him. I cried and begged and groveled and he entertained me by coming to talk to me a couple weeks later, to just yell at me for the same reason again and left.

I got a new job with insurance, I got my gallbladder out, and I got sober from weed and alcohol. I used the pain from the breakup to motivate me to change and I haven't thought about him for months.

Yesterday he texted me ""I miss you"". And just like that I went from being cool with being single to desperately wanting him back. I texted him back and he told me he was sorry for what he did and leaving me when I was sick, then he stopped and ghosted me. 

This morning I asked him to at least say bye so I could have closure and he just sent ""bye"" with a gif of a cat. I sent another text trying to be cheeky by saying ""there's one last thing I have to get off my chest"" and then making it about how I always knew Chappel Roan would be a star, and he lost it. He said ""I'm so so so so glad you love chappel and then the rest had a lot of typos but it was something about how I took advantage of him. I texted back to decipher what he was saying and he sant back ""just along to care for you and
make you happy. I was there to watch
your shows watch you play games. Clean
up for you, plan for you, be your social life
outside of the other jacob. be your mom. And
I enabled it that was fine. That's my regrets.
and I spent that time to just deal with your
life,"" 

To this I just sent ""we were only together 6 months, we've been broken for almost 2 years, you said you missed me, then yelled at me for the same thing you yelled at me when you dumped me, that's cruel. I'm blocking your number. And I blocked his number. I cried all night listening to Coffee by Chappell,I feel like I have to recover from this relationship all over again.

In my opinion my mistake was not blocking his number as soon as I got the first text. I have the urge to put myself out there again and find a new love but I think I just need a hug cause this brought on a depressive episode. Has anyone else gone through the same thing?

Here are my thoughts on the fragrances in this discovery set:

21 Conduit St: 6.5/10. This one smells green and citrusy to me. I do get a hint of lavender as well. 
    
Ambre Premier: 7/10. This is a sticky sweet amber. A little too sweet for me, but still quite nice. 
    
Fire at Will: 7/10. A creamy sweet vanilla. Very gourmand. It reminds me of puff pastry with vanilla cream. 
  
Gardez-Moi: 7/10. At first spray it reminded me of laundry detergent, but it quickly turned into a jasmine bouquet. There’s something a bit woody or earthy—maybe that’s the tomato leaf—under all the jasmine and ylang ylang. The dry down has me thinking of fresh apricots. 
    
Incident Diplomatique: 6.5/10. Vetiver and nutmeg are all I’m getting from this one. The patchouli and sandalwood come through in the dry down. 
    
L’arbre de la Connaissance: 7.5/10. This is a wonderful fig fragrance. It’s pretty much straight fig for me. 
    
L’Art de la Guerre: 7.5/10. A bright clean scent. I love the apple in here. The lavender, nutmeg, leather and oak moss are wonderful together. I would definitely wear this. 
    
La Liturgie des Heures: 7.5/10. This is really nice. I love the green notes with the incense. It’s like fresh clean soap with smoky incense and it totally works. 
    
Les Jeux sont Faits: 6/10. A little too boozy for me—it truly smells like a strong spirit forward cocktail. Gin, rum, cumin and tobacco make this an interesting one. 
    
Musc Pallas: 7/10. A powdery, soapy floral musk. I don’t usually like scents like this, but I’m enjoying this one. 
    
Pavillon Rouge: 8.5/10. I love the boozy tobacco smell of this one. Vanilla and benzoin are a gorgeous base for the leather, coffee, tea, and spices that are also in here. Potentially full bottle worthy. 
    
Private Label: 7/10. I continue to love papyrus as a note. This is really nice and reminds me a little of smoked wood. 
    
Psychedelique: 6.5/10. This one is really interesting. I definitely get the amber and vanilla, but all the other notes are indiscernible to me. It’s a little musky with a little patchouli as it dries down. 
    
Remember Me: 6.5/10. It opens beautifully, like an orange pound cake scent or something, but the dry down isn’t doing it for me. 
    
Rouge Assassin: 6.5/10. For some reason I get an apple note in the opening, but that’s not in there. It’s a nice soft, sweet scent. 
    
Touche Finale: 6.5/10. A brilliant floral, but too light and elegant for me. A little bit of wood and musk tone things down in the dry down.

I finished my associates last year, that I started at 18 and bounced around in order to pay bills. I have been a career nanny for the last 6 years also. I make decent money. But I want a career. This isn’t a forever job. 

I feel super trapped due to my bills to stay. I can’t really afford to cut my hours. My mother has offered to move to where I live (once I have a baby) so I can stay at home and she would pay my portion of the bills and live with me and my husband (electrician working towards his masters).

I have been told by my bosses who have PHDS that I should go back to school and get a degree in social work. But I don’t have the financial background or fall back to protect me (I grew up in foster care).

I love to help others, I love to support, I am insanely organized and structured. I’d really love to find a career where I can apply my skills. I’d love to be a school social worker, or run my own business (I know two different things). Adding school back into my brain feels like a curve ball. I feel like time is running out for me, but I know I am capable and can do anything that is presented to me. I managed a coffee shop at 18 after working there 2 months due to my work ethic. I don’t want to sacrifice my stability for a career, but I know I need a career.

Honestly I don’t even really know what I am asking, but if you were in my shoes what would you do?

1haqjdh,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1haqjdh/amazing_first_date_accidental_mega_plus_ultra/,"Amazing first date, accidental mega plus ultra high the second","Day 1: Had a great first date with a beautiful lady. With a beautiful mind - we talked about some great topics and she just seemed like a person you would want in your life, even if it was just a friend. We had witty banter, lots of laughs, and sprinkled in romantic flirting - like a cheesy 90's sitcom. 7 hours flew by of the same. How'd it end? You guessed it, a visit to the kiss academy. I felt so cool walking away to my Uber ride.

Day 2: Enter the ""Masterbanter"". ""Charisma-Tron"" mayhaps even. Yep that's how good the banter was again. Since we told me should be leaving town in a few days we agreed to a second date the very next day. 

For this date, I arrived early and decided to stop and get coffee. I'm extremely sensitive to caffeine, so naturally I said decaf. This was not decaf, so I started getting a little anxiety. Enter ""CBD"" shop. Weed is not legal here (Malaga city center, Spain) so I say ""give me a vape"" at the counter thinking it would be just some relaxing CBD. We exchange pleasantries and funds, I step outside and take a hit. 

I'm outside surrounded by Christmas lights and tons of people. 10 minutes later I felt so weird. Anxiety went up and depth perception went down. I knew by 15 minutes this was going to be a ride and this date was blown. I look at the vape it says HHC. I'm like wtf is HHC? 30 minutes in I stand up as it's just about arrival time for our date and go to the restaurant using Google maps. 

I go to the ""door"". Ten minutes later I realize I am looking at a window with two people on the other side of it very confused why this stranger is standing here. 

I move to what is hopefully actually a ""door"" and an attendant comes up, I say I have a reservation. I am trying my best to not seem high. I see the attendant conferring with his boss, looking at me like I'm high. They come up and say we have a seat for you. I sit for like 10 mins then I realized I was in the wrong restaurant. It's the one next door. 

About an hour in to vaping, I move to what is hopefully the correct restaurant. They seat me immediately, reservation found. But while I'm sitting there I could tell I was NOT acting normal even though I was trying so hard too, fidgeting a lot etc... I am sure I looked like I was on fentanyl or something bonkers.  Nope HHC. She still hasn't arrived yet. It's Spain. I have learned as an expat no one is on time. So I take the time to plan some witty, fun way to say ""I'm so high, can you take me to a taxi lolz"". 

She arrives. I say it and it's not witty nor funny. She is understandably frustrated. But even then she says in the most gentlest way a human could that it wasn't kind. By asking instead of accusing to get me to reflect.  In my high state I saw what she did there still. She walks my fentanyl addict looking ass to be close to where I needed to be and then told me where to go to continue my quest alone. After that is just a blur but I make it home ultimately and plop on the bed. 

This was a few hours ago. I'm still high but actually somewhat cognitively functional. I know one day I'll laugh about this a lot but I will see if she gives me another shot. Wish me luck.

Hey everyone, I thought I would post my Up Bank referral link in here again for anyone that has been thinking about joining and didn’t take up the offer before - the reward has now gone from $13 to $20 for a limited time! 
I have been with them for 4 years now and genuinely can’t fault them at all. 

- Quick customer service when nearby areas were having network issues, etc. 
- Only 5 minutes to set up an account via their app straight from your phone! So no need to visit a branch and take time out of your busy day
- Ability to create multiple ‘savers’ accounts to visualise your money better, and a respectable interest rate on up to five of these (calculated daily and distributed monthly) 

At the moment there’s a promo if you sign up using an existing customer’s referral link - **we both get $20!** For practically no work at all! That’s Christmas present money (or a cheeky bevy) right there. 

There’s no fees to hold or create an account, so you don’t have to fully co-opt their system or switch to it as your main bank. You can just make the account, make yourself some money and be done with it! 

They also give cashback for random coffees purchased on weekdays (7am-11am) and during ‘Happy Hour’ on Friday (5pm-7pm), where there’s a chance they’ll cover the cost of a food or drink purchase for you!

P.S. For those concerned, Up Bank is backed by Bendigo Bank, so there is some good ‘real bank’ security behind their awesome systems too 😚

Now I finally bought an Ode Gen 2 to return the borrowed Opus and it was a total let down, but it’s weird because: the grind is coming out even and size comparing to the opus looks basically the same. I’ve went through all grind sizes from 1 to 11 to see what they tasted like and basically every cup tasted the same, like if I was drinking a tasteless burnt rancid coffee. I got the opus back today to do a comparison and the first thing that hit me was that the coffee is coming out of the opus smelling delicious but the ode gen 2 is giving a horrible smell. Is it normal for new grinders to give a rancid smell when new? (Coffee is recently bought directly from a coffee farm so this is not the problem since every other method that I use it with gives out a great taste, basically any other grinder works and doesn’t give the rancid taste). Can you recommend a way to clean the grinder? I’ve already went through 2 pounds of coffee and no improvements. Is using Urnex Grindz worth it? Could you recommend anything I could do to fix this?

I am looking for a woman who I can travel, cosplay, geek out with and eventually share a life with. But for now a coffee, if local, would be great.

I am primarily an espresso brewer but I thought I would give this a try because it feels like a great no fuss way to make coffee I the morning before heading g to work (pour and ignore)!

I am still trying to dial in the recipe.. today I had a pretty good attempt with a 20g / 325 ml ratio that drew down In a little over 4 minutes (no exact time but more than 4 and definitely less than 5).

The coffee I am using is is this: https://eightouncecoffee.ca/collections/all-coffee-bags

I have actually brewed this as a long black (it’s basically best as a turbo.. and messy shot… like 20seconds with 9 seconds pre-infusion)

When I did it as a hoop this morning I noted that it got the general idea of the coffee (like a mulled wine! But generally harder to pick out specific flavours.. I also noted what I think might have been some over extraction (a kind of muddiness that would appear on occasion with some sips). So I may try to go a bit coarser. 
I will note that the recommended 15 /250 felt like it didn’t have enough body. Which is why I cranked the dose.

For those who do have it.. is it in your regular rotation? Do you favour specific kinds of coffees with it? Am I doing something wrong here?

1hapyd6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/1hapyd6/mi_boss_and_coworker_pressuring_me_to_date/,[MI] boss and coworker pressuring me to date coworker’s son,"okay. so…
i work in a school. i am in a behavioral support position and i work closely with the main office staff and administrators.
about a year ago, one of the secretaries approached another staff member i am close with outside of the job and said that her son had seen a photo of me on facebook and called me his “dream girl”. she asked that friend of mine how I would feel about being set up with someone. my friend told her that I would hate that, that I don’t date, it has never been my thing, and basically that I don’t shit where I eat anyway.
the secretary then asked me about the following day and I said the same thing. she asked, can i at least leave you with his phone number in case you change your mind and i said yes that’s ok, because i didn’t want to say no (i know, my boundary setting in this situation was not good and only gets worse but i truly was trying my very best. i am practicing).
this was last december. i became close (in a coworkers sense) with this woman, kind of developing a “work mom” type relationship with her. i’m realizing in hindsight that i should have seen the rest of this coming and kept my standard coworker arms length distance with her. but, i did share some vague things with her about my past experiences that have shaped me as well as my current perspectives on life matters as these things came up in conversation that felt casual at the time. i know, and i see my mistake there. for the remainder of last school year it was hardly mentioned, in passing once or twice but it was passive and seemed to be in a bit of a joking manner so i didn’t have an opinion on it for a long time.

this school year, things have been different.
she started by just mentioning it to me more often. each time, i told her that i was not interested in dating to begin with, that i don’t want to date anyone related to anyone i work with, and that i am not interested in pursuing her son.
this fall, she had a “psychic party” with a couple of coworkers. now, do i believe in the idea of a ‘psychic’? sure. why not? do i believe that people who you can pay to come to your house and read a bunch of your friend’s palms are legitimate? no shot. but, i am trying to be more social this year and i enjoyed the company of the people who would be there and so i agreed and i went.
her son was there.
after my “reading” (done by a strange man who told me i should not be reading tarot “for myself” and sexually harassed all of us for the entirety of the night), she said she wanted to “talk to me outside”. she asked me questions like did he say i was going to be married or have kids etc. and i told her he said i was going to have two kids (I don’t want kids, never have, have always been vocal about it). Before i could make a second remark about his suggestion that i’d have kids, she made this excited sound and put her hand over her mouth and acted a bit weird for a minute. in hindsight, i am willing to bet that he “told” her son that he would have two kids as well. i also have no doubt in my mind that she told this “psychic” that she wanted to set us up together and that this “psychic” used that info to his advantage as she was his long standing client, apparently. while we were outside, her son came out to speak with us and at one point she turned to head back inside and i immediately followed her; the son seemed to have expected me to stay outside but eventually did follow us back in.
at that point i was working my way up to heading out. i sat on the kitchen floor to pet their dogs and the son came and sat with me and we talked, just about the dogs. it was very casual conversation and the son himself did not make me uncomfortable per se, i just don’t want to DATE the kid. anyway, everyone was in the living room apparently gossiping about the “love birds” in the kitchen.

anyway.
that was october.
since then things have been escalating. more comments, and she has even gone as far as “giving me permission to fuck him” (because i said while asking them to stop: ‘i don’t like to date i like to have sex and go home’), and telling me that she “happens to know that both of her sons are well endowed”. things that i would never want to hear about anybody, much less their mother. things someone’s mother should never be saying and things she should never be doing.

my bosses have both joined in at this point.
the head principal has done far less than the assistant principal but he has made comments. one day the son was visiting his mom (i know) at the office and was in the principals office talking with him - because he visits his moms work often enough to be friendly with the staff. that is strange to me. anyway, i had to walk into his office to hand him a drink from a group order we had placed. there was a brief exchange, i left, had to go back in for one more quick moment and then went back to the assistant principal’s office where we were all getting food from the order to the right people and sitting down to eat and talk.
a while later, the principal walks into the office and makes a comment. he says “i don’t usually do this and i want to stay out of it but i will just say this” and mentions that he thinks that the son was there “hoping for a chance encounter” with me and that there was “undeniable tension” in the office when we were both in there. the tension that he is speaking of was 100% there, its called discomfort and “i want to get out of here without having to engage with this guy”.
then they all started in.
he has not said anything about it to me since.
the assistant principal however, has. she and the secretary whose son is in question have both escalated to the point of telling me that i don’t want to date him because i am “self sabotaging” and “afraid to let myself be happy”. this is an insane sentiment to me after i have spent the last year telling them repeatedly that i don’t like to date because i am perfectly happy and i don’t feel like my life is lacking anything for not having a romantic partner or connection. i don’t feel a lack of love. i don’t feel lonely. i am not unhappy. they have heard that and basically told me that i’m wrong, and that i have to give it a shot and they have insisted that he may surprise me.
well, after so long, i started to doubt myself. i started to think maybe they are right and i am wrong. she told me that he asked me to coffee and i declined and i said absolutely not, he never asked me that. she left work that day and 20 mins later he sent me a message asking me to coffee. like that isn’t all incredibly weird. i panicked. but i decided that at least, i can go to coffee and have a nice cup of coffee and then i can tell them okay, i tried it like you asked and it is still not for me. please dont ask again.

i went for that coffee yesterday. it wasn’t awful; he is a nice enough guy, for somebody else. very very not my type for a myriad of reasons; all reasons which i saw coming and told them are reasons i did not want to pursue.

anyway, he asked if i would like to go again and i let him down very kindly and gently and told him that i hope we can still be cool with each other if we see one another and i hope he can understand. i repeated everything i’ve been saying this whole time; dating has never been a priority for me and i am not looking to change that. “it’s not you it’s me” without saying that and also, genuinely that decision is about me far more than it is about him. his response was a simple “All good”, which I can’t be bothered with worrying if he means that or not. I’m worried, however, that since he seems to have such an insanely enmeshed relationship with his mother, that I will have to deal with either hostility or more pushy behavior after this.
I’m hoping for advice on how to proceed if anybody brings this up to me beyond me telling them that I tried and I am still not interested. I am feeling very disrespected and backed into a corner here. I feel as though these women want the satisfaction of an “I told you so” or a feeling that they “got us together”. I think they are struggling to wrap their minds around a 26 year old woman being genuinely fulfilled with no significant other or romantic love life at all. I think that they want this kid to “get his dream girl”. I think the secretary wants to be my mother in law. I think she wants her son out of her house and she knows he won’t leave until he is in a relationship / another woman’s responsibility. I am struggling to understand what in the world they want for ME, as i’ve told them what *I want for me* and they have been just telling me that I am wrong.

I know how I plan to respond verbally, and I know how I plan to operate going forward to place that boundary and keep it there. I am looking for advice in preparation I guess. If anything continues, what in the world do I do? I have a unique position and transferring to another building is not an option. If the environment becomes too hostile I will have to choose not to return next school year, but I will have to get through the next 6 months without becoming unprofessional about this.

1hapy4q,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1hapy4q/advice_on_reconnecting_with_my_estranged_brother/,Advice on reconnecting with my estranged brother who may still be under the influence of nMom ,"I’ll eventually try and unpack specific instances of abuse here, but for the sake of this post, just take it as given I grew up with a stereotypical nMom… pick 5 nMom posts from this sub and you basically know me.  The issue…

My bio parents divorced when I (44m) was 14 (nMom cheated) and when I was 16 she had my half-brother with her second husband.  We weren’t really in a financial position to make it easy, so my younger full-brother (m41 now) had to share a room and we both got deputized voluntold caregivers.  Needless to say this put a strain on the relationships with both brothers.  New brother got all the attention and consideration… example: my mother got rid of my cat one day while I was at school (which I loved, it was my only safe space) … saying it wasn’t healthy to have a cat in the house while she was as pregnant.  And so on and so on… it’s fair to say 16 year old me resented hi a LOT.  And my relationship with my full-brother suffered because of being forced into proximity.  Plus she’d play us off each other… getting my brother to snoop through my stuff so she could say “well it’s HIS room too.. I didn’t snoop”.  

Anyways… I left for Uni far away as soon as I could.  I’d come back to visit on holidays and in the summer for the first year or so… but soon I was using study or work to skip family stuff.  I’d never have enough time to visit everyone when I came back, and if I spent more than one day visiting my Dads side my mom would throw tantrums… it just became an obligation, there was no joy and it and it strained my already tight budget to travel.  Once I was out of Uni I went back even less.  So needless to say I never really had a relationship with my half-brother when he was young… he got engaged right before the pandemic and put their wedding on indefinite hold.    He was in my wedding party 10 years ago… mostly out of obligation, both me and my wife had our siblings as our party.  I don’t hate him, in fact I wish him all the best, but we just don’t have any kind of relationship.  

This summer shit apparently hit the fan in a MASSIVE way… he got married… I wasn’t invited and no one told me about it.  I also found out through the grape vine that a week before his wedding my nMom announced that she was leaving her third husband (brother was with husband 2) and was moving back to the butt-fuck nowhere town she grew up in (and hates more than anything this world) to be with a highschool crush she’d been in contact with for a year.  This has been her MO her whole life… I think she’s been single for MAYBE a month total since she was 18… she goes from husband to boyfriend to husband to another husband… always lining the next one up weeks or months ahead of time and literally moving out from one and into another.  She’s now mid sixties btw.  But for some reason insisted on bring her now latest ex-husband to the wedding anyways… his own kids didn’t even know and found out at the wedding.

My initial reaction was to be hurt about not being invited…  I know we’re not close, but he was at my wedding and nothing good or bad has happened between us since.  But I took a second and realized it was his wedding, his choice… and I remember hating how much of my own wedding was obligation and not choice.  Weddings are expensive so at the end of the day if me not going meant he could invite someone he actually wanted there… great.  I also realized that with my mother kinda out of the picture (she moved across the province, 18 hours away I might actually be able to have a relationship with my brother.  My mom basically used everyone as spies whether they realized or not and bad mouthed me constantly to everyone.  So I find it extremely hard to trust ANYONE In my mom’s orbit.  

I sent him a congratulations message about a week after the wedding as soon as I found out and he responded saying thanks and that he hoped I understood as I haven’t really been a part of his life and that it hurt that his oldest brother basically abandoned him.  I told him I completely understand, no hard feelings and I don’t blame him one bit for not inviting me and for how he feels toward me.  We chatted a bit and ended up making very tentative plans to grab a coffee next time I’m in town… maybe at Xmas.

So here’s the rub… I have no idea how deep my mother’s claws are sunk into him and how much of her alternate facts he believes.  It SEEMS that they have a pretty decent relationship… his partner seems to get along with her…. And if we do talk I want to make it about US not her… but how do I explain my side of things without that context?  If they do have a relationship he’s happy with I don’t want to get in the way of that… but if that’s the case it makes it that much harder to trust him… I also don’t want this to become further ammo against me “why are you filling your brothers head with lies… why are you trying to turn him against me”.  I’ve basically become isolated from her entire side of the family… they’re all very don’t rock the boat… don’t make a fuss, can’t we all just turn a blind eye and be nice.  Not kind… nice.  So in the decades of issues with my mom they’ve never once reached out to me… to get my side of the story or even just see if I was OK.  I have to assume they either believe my mother’s reality or they just don’t care enough to intervene.. family matters are family matters, it’s none of our business and/or I’m not putting myself in the line of fire.

I know I’m partially to blame for basically tapping out not building a relationship with him… he was an innocent casualty of my relationship with my mom… I feel terribly guilty about it all the time, but I just don’t know how to go about fixing things without jeopardizing the peace I’ve built being almost no-contact with my mother.  Bring him into my life opens doors for my mom to weasel her way back in.  Help?

A claim of a thread—so fragile, unfair.
But love wasn’t a thread to me, it was steel,
A bond so deep, it’s all I could feel.

The car became a confessional booth,
Heart breaking again beneath hard-spoken truth.
Tears held hostage, a fragile ceasefire,
Dreams smoldering in their funeral pyre.

Iced coffee in hand, a change in routine,
A world surreal, like a half-written scene.
“Switching away from the mocha?” she smiled,
Her glowing brown skin, her gaze soft and mild.

Those beautiful brown eyes held me in place,
A moment of warmth, a moment of grace.
Her kindness a balm for the ache in my chest,
Her care unexpected, her presence a rest.

But then his message returned to my mind,
A weight too heavy, a knot to unwind:
“I didn’t have it in me,” it echoed again,
And my love spilled out, unanswered, in vain.

So here I stand, shattered to the core,
I can’t bear to repair this heart anymore.
If you can’t hold my love with the care it deserves,
Then spare me your words, as my soul it unnerves.

Don’t reach for me, if you can’t reach to stay,
Don’t break me twice, then walk away.
I rebuild alone, as you live your life,
While I cry myself to sleep every night.

“Have a good day, dear,” she softly imparts,
Her voice a stitch on my unraveling heart.
No family, no love—just fragments of me,
Wondering if this is life, or purgatory.

But maybe in moments of strangers’ embrace,
We find the divine in this fleeting place.

Yet the smallest gestures can ease what aches.",1,1733792807.0,PoetryWritingClub,4,1.0,False

It’s like my nicotine withdrawals but worse. I thought it might be a food addiction but food doesn’t help. It’s this bottomless need and it feels so horrible, deeper than depression. I’ve just had no idea what it is.

About a month ago I stopped having back and forth with my ex. I have had withdrawals since the break up but this has been a whole other level. And I realized today that the only thing that releases my withdrawal symptoms a bit is reliving the events over and over in my head. It’s like some sort of sick obsession with my pain.

She broke up with me because she felt horrible about how she was treating me and I spent the next 4 months desperately trying to figure out what happened. I lost my job, I was spending all day doing insane tasks like going through every text message we’ve ever had to find every fight we had and I made a probably 100 page document about it. I replayed every fight we’d had in my head nonstop. I wrote her 100’s of pages of letters. I was texting her nonstop. We also both have bipolar and I will say my manic episode following the break up really heightened my addiction to the ups and downs, and my capacity to spend all my time obsessing over the trauma while ignoring its impact on me.

I know people can be addicted to their partner and especially in abusive and traumatic relationships but this is another level. I’ve been trying so hard to move on and the withdrawals are the most intense feeling I have ever had. And she was addicted to me too, she also has a history of severe addiction and was manic but her response to that has been very different. But the intense and emotionally abusive fallout made things absolutely crazy for me.

My nicotine, food, and tv addictions have all increased to cope. I have to especially hold myself back from alcohol because I just know this state I’m in is dangerous. I even tried coffee which I don’t drink for medical reasons today to see if it would do anything.

I’m wondering if anyone else here has felt similarly? How did you cope? I’m trying so hard to do better, and in some ways I am, but it just gets worse in terms of withdrawals.",2,1733792731.0,abusiverelationships,1,1.0,False

Childish stories give way to reality, an understanding of how what was once thought of as boring is actually the driving force behind those childish stories. And in this collapse of psychi, because it is psychotic, people loose their minds, die, become something more, and often time something much less.

We are not having the discourse in our society about this. It seems to effect nearly everyone I come across, and I hope to God that mine is done. 

It is all as natural as can be I think. Because we are still natural, I believe this is still undesigned, but it will be taken advantage of. It either already has or is about to be monotized--depression I mean. 

The Middle: 

I keep trying to pin point where it all came from, from the zoomies to the colors, and from my own pools of tears to sitting on the beach wonderfully alone, knowing this may not be all of humanities tears crashing against the sand and wearing away the cliffs.

I've been crushed. I've been crushed into a diamond of human that I do not recognize while the time alone simply embarressed me, suddenly, all of my coping is just childish dribble, a tantrum. Now it's time to clean. I hope the next tear storm waters the big seqoia, she's lovely.

The End:

I went insane trying to paint the universe of colors in my mind with all the white I was given. All I needed to know is that prisms shatter light into everything else. But that knowledge took me to the brink. I peered deep into the void, and everyone behind shouted ""DONT"", silently of course, from behind their phones, they said ""you'll become the void if you do that too long"". And then I said ""No.... It is not the void anymore, because I am home, and I will fill it with all the colors of my mind.""

Ever felt like your hand is a prisoner in a tiny, plastic jail while you're working? I'm talking about the dreaded 'mouse hand', folks. Well, it's time to break free! Let's dive into the world of ergonomic mouse reviews, where comfort meets productivity. Buckle up, because we're about to get real personal with my mouse-hating fingers, and I promise, you won't want to miss this.
  
  
## The Awakening

It was a typical Tuesday when I first felt it—a dull ache creeping up my wrist, as if my device was silently plotting my demise. I had been clicking away, lost in the never-ending abyss of spreadsheets, memes, and cat videos. The discomfort caught me off guard. I mean, who knew a simple mouse could wreak such havoc? I thought I was invincible, but it turns out my trusty sidekick had turned into a back-stabbing villain.

As the days rolled into weeks, the pain intensified. I found myself gritting my teeth, cursing under my breath every time I felt that all-too-familiar sting. I even tried to convince myself that it was just a phase. Maybe I needed to stretch? Or, I should hire a personal trainer—because who wouldn’t want to workout while scrolling through Instagram, right? But deep down, I knew the truth: I was an accidental masochist in a digital world.

One night, after a particularly intense gaming session (my thumb didn’t know what hit it), I found myself staring at my mouse as if it was a long-lost nemesis. That’s when it hit me: enough was enough. I needed to find my arm’s one true ally. A quest for the perfect ergonomic mouse was born, and believe me, I was ready to conquer whatever lay ahead.

## The Ergonomic Epiphany

Picture this: you're sitting at your desk, engrossed in your computer screen, and suddenly your hand feels like it’s about to stage a revolt. Your trusty mouse, a tool you use every day, could actually be the villain, plotting against your comfort. This, my friends, is the uncomfortable truth about ergonomics.

So, what exactly is ergonomics? Think of it this way: if your home is like a cozy fort made of pillows and blankets, ergonomics is the architecture that makes it livable. It's all about designing tools and workspaces that fit our bodies, not the other way around. Have you ever tried to fit into shoes two sizes too small? It’s miserable! The same principle applies to sitting at a desk and using a mouse that doesn’t suit your hand. 

I remember when I switched to a mouse that promised ergonomic wonders. At first, it felt like swapping a one-legged stool for a plush chair. My wrist thanked me; my posture started doing a little happy dance. It’s crazy how a small change can make an enormous difference—like discovering that the ""snack"" in the cupboard is actually cookies instead of stale crackers! Choosing the right ergonomic mouse isn’t just about comfort; it's about preventing pain and enjoying those blissful hours spent in front of your screen. You deserve it!

## The Great Mouse-off

It's funny how something as tiny as a mouse can make such a colossal difference in our daily grind. I mean, have you ever found yourself wrestling with one of those traditional, flat pieces of plastic that does more to cramp your style, or should I say, your wrist? Let's dive right into the Great Mouse-off, where I’ll share my fair experiences with three popular ergonomic mouse models. 

First up, there’s the one designed for your palm like it’s giving it a hug—seriously, it feels like it was sculpted by hand for comfort. I loved the way my fingers just kind of fell into place. The scrolling was oh-so-smooth, but I must admit that after a couple of hours, my wrist felt like it was doing the cha-cha, maybe a bit too much tilt!

Then, there’s the sleek, futuristic one that made me feel like I was operating a spaceship. The design was a sight to behold! However, I wish I could say my hand agreed. After an hour, my fingers were ready to stage a protest. 

Finally, the one with customizable buttons was a game-changer—talk about feeling like a tech wizard! But here’s the kicker: I kept hitting the wrong buttons instead of the magic ones I needed. So, what’s the takeaway? Comfort is a personal journey, and like that trusty pair of shoes, you have to find your perfect fit. Which mouse do you think you’d end up negotiating with? Indeed, it’s hard to decide!

## The Science Behind the Curve

Have you ever thought about the way your mouse is shaped? I mean, it sits there, all innocent-like, but it could be the culprit behind your wrist pain after hours of scrolling and clicking. The science behind ergonomic mouse designs is actually pretty fascinating, and it’s worth diving into.

Ergonomic mice are crafted to support the natural position of your hand and wrist, reducing strain during use. According to experts like Dr. David Rempel, an occupational health specialist at the University of California, Berkeley, the awkward angles many traditional mice force us into can lead to repetitive stress injuries. I remember chatting with a friend who’s an office worker; he switched to an ergonomic mouse and said it felt like he was shaking hands with a cloud rather than wrestling with a brick!

Research from the American Journal of Industrial Medicine shows that users of ergonomic mice report less discomfort and improved productivity. The key is the design—many have a vertical grip that allows your hand to rest at a more natural angle, putting less pressure on your median nerve. 

Wouldn't it be nice to have a mouse that didn’t secretly plot against your comfort? If your hand could talk, it might shout, “Help! I’m in a twisted relationship!” By paying attention to design, we can transform our daily routines for the better.

## The Holy Grail: My Personal Pick

Finding the perfect ergonomic mouse can feel like searching for the Holy Grail, something that brings both comfort and functionality without device-related regret. I was on this quest myself, dodging a variety of mice like a seasoned dodgeball player while I scoured reviews, opinions, and even the occasional TikTok trend. But lo and behold, I stumbled upon a mouse that felt like it was custom-crafted just for me. Seriously, it was like that moment in a rom-com when the love interests finally meet. 

This mouse, with its well-contoured shape, wraps around my hand like it just knew I had spent years developing some serious wrist angst. I noticed my wrist pain fading away almost instantly, like a magic trick, except instead of a rabbit, I got relief. The buttons—oh boy! They clicked with just the right amount of resistance. I never realized how satisfying a good click could be until I experienced it. I felt like a kid again playing games and reveling in the clicky joy. 

But here’s the catch—not every mouse will feel magical for you. Think about your own hands—are they small, large, or perhaps somewhere awkwardly in-between? Your grip style, whether you palm, claw, or fingertip it, is like the secret ingredient in a grandma's chili recipe. So, while I rave about my favorite mouse, consider what feels right for your unique hands. Before jumping on trends, check your specific needs. After all, what works for one might just leave another in a hand-cramping mess.

## The Future is Here... and It's Weird

The future of ergonomic mice is shaping up to be a wild ride, and boy, is it strange! Picture this: a mouse that can actually read your mind. Okay, okay, that might be a bit of a stretch, but there are prototypes out there that get pretty close. Researchers are looking at ways to create mice that can adapt to your movements. They could sense when you’re feeling tense and adjust their shape on the fly, which is almost like having a personal trainer. “Hey, buddy, loosen up those fingers!” I can just hear it now.

Then there are these outrageous designs that look like they came straight out of a sci-fi movie. Imagine a mouse shaped like…a banana. Yes, you read that right! Some designers believe that an ergonomic shape inspired by nature could actually make your hand feel way more relaxed. I mean, who knew fruit could be so influential in tech? I’ve seen one that can change its surface texture based on your grip style. It’s like a chameleon for your hand!

Now, let’s talk about how these funky innovations might impact our work. Could these gadgets lead to lower stress levels and higher productivity? One can dream! What if we could wave goodbye to those achy wrists and hello to full-on zen mode? You never know; the humble mouse might just be the next great revolution in how we interact with our screens. Now, if only they could brew my coffee…

## Conclusions
  
  
So, there you have it, folks! My ergonomic mouse journey has been a rollercoaster, but every aching finger was worth it.

And hey, if you've got a ergonomic mouse love story to share, I'm all ears (and fingers, apparently).",1,1733792635.0,EverythingErgonomic,0,1.0,False
