1ledd47,https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/1ledd47/colonization_production_and_economy_question/,Colonization Production and Economy Question,"Hi All,

I have a few rather unrelated questions:

  
1) I have a system where I've placed 3 extraction T1s on an HMC with an Coriolis above, and another HMC with 2 Refineries and a T1 L Port. The port is working great, having Liquid Oxygen, CMM, Ceramics, Water, Steel, Aluminum and Titanium in the thousands. However, I'm not getting Aluminum or Liquid Oxygen at all on the Coriolis and I'm baffled on why is this, any clues?

2) Will building High Tech facilities fuck up the setup from above? I want to be producing more Lichen, H.E. Suits and the like - was thinking two T1 bio research settlements on an Icy world with an Orbis above them, is this a valid setup for what I intend to do or I have to approach it in some other way?

3)  I have an Icy world with an Industrial Outpost above it, producing more than enough Computer components, Crop Harvesters, Mineral Extractors, but it's barely producing any Building Fabricators, any idea why that might be? I have a single Industrial T1 settlement in the system and it's a weak link with said outpost. The only strong link with the outpost is an refinery on the Icy below it (don't ask, I don't have a clue of what was I thinking) Can I build more of these or will it screw with my set up from 1)? 

4) What is the best setup for more food types? I have a water world with 2 Space farm installations and a couple surface agriculture T1 Ms scattered in the system, but I'm only getting coffee and food cartridges on the Coriolis from 1). Is the key just building more of those or am I missing something?

  
I'm referring to [https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/1k835r6/best\_economy\_types\_for\_colonization/](https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/1k835r6/best_economy_types_for_colonization/) for what economy produces what, I'm not sure how true it is.

  
Thank you!

1ledbpo,https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledPeople/comments/1ledbpo/late_lunch/,Late Lunch,"So this happened to me last Monday 16/06/2025.

I own and run a small Italian coffee/sandwich shop in North West Wales on the coast, business is very seasonal so I am not open all year round and I am not open 24/7.

So I had a good day Monday, plenty of happy customers and takings were reasonable for the time of year, 2pm is when I usually start to shutdown for the day, I have a couple of customers sat outside in the sun, having coffees and a slice of cake, so I start to slowly close up as I don't want to make the customers feel that they have to leave immediately.  It gets to 2:30pm and I am pretty much shutdown and ready to go home, my 2 customers are still sat outside so I do a few more tasks around the place.  

Then suddenly I hear a woman speaking, ""Are you closed?"", I politely reply, ""Yes I am"".  

Here we go!  

She responds ""That is not the way to run a business!, I am on holiday, I get up late and have a late breakfast, I then go for a walk and then I like to have a late lunch!  Every time I come here you are closed!  Why are you not open later?!""  

I politely respond, ""I do not get enough trade to be open past 2pm"".  

She responds ""But you have people drinking coffee outside!"". 

I reply ""They came in for coffee before 2""  

She's starting to bite now, ""How do you know you won't serve anyone after 2?!""  

Again I politely reply ""Because I have stayed open until 4pm and had few sales past 2pm"" 

She responds, ""But I like to have a late lunch!!"".  ""I was going to have a coffee and possibly a slice of cake!!!""

She promptly walks out of the door.

My final words to her as she walked away were,  ""I can't please everyone""

I told my wife of the encounter when I arrived home, she just looked at me and said ""Did you not show her where the door was"", too be honest I was too taken back by her entitlement.",1,1750241298.0,EntitledPeople,0,1.0,False

1ledaqp,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackNovel/comments/1ledaqp/link_and_tittle_plzz/,link and Tittle plzz?,"Cherry cake

On our wedding anniversary, my husband insisted on inviting his entire crew of friends. Among them was a female ""bro"" I'd never seen before. The moment she walked in, she plopped down directly on my husband's lap and started a video call: ""Mom, I made it! Your godson is sitting right next to me."" Then she turned and pressed her face close to his: ""If you treat me badly, I'll have both our families beat you up!"" Crack! The glass I was holding slipped from my fingers. In an instant, everyone's eyes were on me. His female ""bro"" just arched one eyebrow: ""Hey, I was just joking around. You're not mind by that, are you?"" I just smiled and calmly said： ""Of course, I don't mind, the room is ready for both of you."" ""After all, no one wants to see you rutting like animals.""

The private room fell silent instantly—you could hear a pin drop.

I instinctively looked at Knox.

He just smiled and playfully tapped Piper's head, his tone affectionate: ""Today's my wedding anniversary with my wife. Don't be so wild.""

She pouted flirtatiously, naturally wrapping her arms around his neck: ""Fine. Since you're throwing this welcome-home party for me, I'll give you that much.""

By then, a server came in to clean up the broken glass and handed me a new cup.

Someone took the opportunity to ease the tension: ""Don't mind her, Riley. Piper's always been carefree—she doesn't mean any harm.""

I remained silent.

Piper glanced at me dismissively: ""Don't tell me you're actually this petty?""

After that, she released her hold on Knox and hopped off his lap: ""Guess I better keep my distance from you, Knox. So wifey doesn't throw a fit when you get home.""

Then she shook her head with a dramatic sigh, teasing the group of guys: ""Now you see why I don't hang out with women?""

""So dramatic and sensitive. It's exhausting.""

Nobody picked up her comment, and the atmosphere turned awkward.

Someone hesitantly spoke up: ""Piper, it's their anniversary today, maybe tone it down a bit...""

Suddenly Piper covered her mouth in mock realization: ""Oh my god, I almost forgot! I brought a gift!""

Then she pulled out a velvet jewelry box from her purse and presented it to Knox like a prized treasure: ""Ta-da!""

When she opened the box, inside lay a pair of gleaming gemstone cufflinks—men's cufflinks.

Someone politely gasped in admiration.

Knox smiled. ""You came all the way back home—I should be the one giving you gifts.""

Hearing this, Piper gave him a coy look and reached over to fasten them on his wrists.

As she moved, matching cufflinks on her own sleeves caught the light brilliantly.

""Hmph, I picked these out especially for you. You better appreciate them.""

Some people had already begun secretly glancing at my expression, but I just took a deep breath, my clenched fingers leaving crescent-shaped marks on my palm.

Then I stood up.

Knox frowned. ""Where are you going?""

I forced a smile. ""To book you two a hotel room.""

""Otherwise I'm afraid you'll do it right here.""

The moment I finished speaking, Piper violently smashed the empty jewelry box in her hand onto the floor.

She cursed loudly: ""What's wrong with this chick?""

""I told you guys we should've just hung out with the bros.""

""Now she's completely ruined the mood!""

Knox chased after me, his tone urgent: ""Babe, Piper doesn't mean anything by it.""

""They're just cufflinks. She's always been casual like this—don't take it personally.""

""And what you said back there was way out of line...""

I gave him a cold smile. ""So the real reason you invited all your friends today was to celebrate your childhood sweetheart coming home, right?""

Knox shifted uncomfortably, avoiding my eyes. ""Why are you making such a big deal out of this?""

""Besides, our anniversaries are always just the two of us—that gets a bit dull.""

""I thought inviting more people would make it more fun.""

Seeing my expression darken, Knox grabbed my hand, his tone softening unusually: ""Babe, don't overthink this. Piper and I have known each other for years—if something was going to happen between us, it would have already.""

""And look, I chose to be with you, didn't I?""

I nearly laughed from anger: ""I'm so sorry for taking your childhood sweetheart's place.""

""Fine, I'll step aside.""

Knox's face flushed red as he yanked his hand away, his tone hardening: ""What are you talking about? You know that's not what I meant.""

""Riley, you're being completely unreasonable!""

With that, he stormed off without looking back.

But his footsteps gradually slowed. I knew he was waiting for me to compromise and follow him, just like I always had before.

I frowned, turned around and walked away.

This man is truly disgusting!

Knox came home at three in the morning.

He was completely wasted, clothes disheveled, reeking of alcohol, stumbling as he tried to embrace me.

I frowned and dodged him, but he caught my wrist.

Next second, his boozy breath hit my face: ""Happy anniversary, babe. Look what I got you.""

He pulled a jewelry box from his pocket and opened it in front of me—it was the Graff Diamonds jewelry set I'd been eyeing for months.

But my eyes quickly fell on the two empty spots in the box.

Knox scratched his head sheepishly: ""Piper accidentally saw it, and she really liked the bracelet and ring. She insisted on taking them.""

""I figured you already have plenty of bracelets and rings, so I let her have them...""

When I didn't take it, he tried to force the box into my hands, his tone reassuring: ""Babe, don't be mad. If you really want them, I'll buy you another set, okay?""

Yet I just stepped back, letting the jewelry box clatter to the floor.

Knox paused, pressed his lips together to control his temper, then forced a smile: ""Babe, I was wrong today. I'm sorry.""

""I shouldn't have invited so many people on our anniversary. But look what I got!""

With that, he pulled out a small cherry cake from behind his back.

I stared at the cake, memories flooding back...

The day we got together, he had given me a cherry cake too.

Since then, we'd promised to celebrate every important occasion with cherry cake.

In that moment, fragments of everything we'd experienced together over the years flashed before my eyes.

I sighed and finally accepted it.

Fine. I'll forgive him one last time.

Seeing me unwrap the cake, Knox's face lit up with a huge smile.

As he fed me a bite, he cautiously began: ""Babe, Piper just got back and hasn't found an apartment yet...""

""She wants to stay with us for a few days. Is that okay?""

""She promised she won't cause you any trouble!""

The sickly sweet taste in my mouth suddenly made me nauseous.

I rushed to the bathroom and couldn't help throwing up.

Knox followed anxiously, patting my back: ""What's wrong? Babe.""

I forcibly pushed his hand away, went to the table and smashed everything on it.

I looked at him, my eyes red: ""Yes, she can stay!

""I'll go!""

Knox's expression instantly changed, his voice rising: ""What are you making a scene about now? I told you it's temporary! You're walking out over something this trivial?""

His contorted face reflected in my eyes, but this time, the light in my eyes had completely extinguished.

I shook my head and forced a bleak smile: ""Let's get divorced.""

Knox clearly hadn't expected me to say that.

He exploded with rage, violently kicking over the coffee table:

""Riley, are you mental? You're really pushing it!""

I locked myself in the master bedroom.

When Knox finished his shower and found the door wouldn't open, he pounded on it furiously before slinking off to the guest room.

The next morning, he sat at the breakfast table with a cold expression. The table was set with an elaborate breakfast.

I snickered.

Playing the silent treatment card? How pathetic.

I just gave him a cold glance and walked expressionlessly toward the front door.

Knox couldn't take it anymore: ""Riley, don't be so ungrateful!""

""You were wrong yesterday too. You shouldn't throw around divorce as an empty threat.""

Without looking back, I replied flatly: ""I'm serious. Start preparing for it.""

After I closed the door, I heard dishes shattering inside.

...

By the time I reached the office, my emotions had completely settled.

My work efficiency remained as high as ever. Almost no one could tell I was having relationship troubles.

During a meeting, my boss announced: ""We have an international order that requires someone to travel to British for a month.""

""If anyone's interested, contact me. The company will cover all expenses, plus a travel allowance.""

At that moment, messages from Knox popped up one after another on my phone screen. I irritably turned off the phone and said loudly: ""I can go.""

After the meeting, a close colleague stopped me, sounding puzzled: ""Riley, what about your husband while you're gone for a month?""

I replied nonchalantly: ""Oh, he has his childhood sweetheart to keep him company. He won't be lonely.""

Hearing my words, my colleague realized they'd said something wrong and awkwardly shut up.

When I got home that evening, I found an unfamiliar suitcase in the entryway.

Bright pink, covered with random stickers.

I took off my heels only to discover someone had taken my house slippers.

My expression darkened immediately.

Walking barefoot a few steps forward, I heard flirtatious laughter: ""Wow, Knox! Your cooking has really improved since I last saw you!""

Piper was wearing my cherry slippers, eating with oil dripping down her chin.

In her hands were clearly my plate and fork.

Seeing me approach, Piper seemed startled: ""Oh! How do you walk so silently? You could've said something—you just scared me!""

""Knox, you're even more jumpy than I am. Must be rough getting scared by your wife every day, huh?""

Without wasting a single word, I stepped forward and slapped her across the face twice, hard and loud.

Then I threw the dishes on the table to the floor.

Piper was stunned by the slaps at first, then immediately exploded: "" You dare hit me?!""

Knox heard the commotion and rushed out from the kitchen, grabbing the raging Piper.

She twisted in his arms: ""Knox, did you see that? Has your wife lost her mind? She hit me the second she walked in!""

""How can you stand this psycho? Why are you holding me back? Hit her back for me!""

Knox's face darkened as he yelled at me: ""Riley, what is wrong with you? Apologize right now!""

I curled my lips into a smile: ""Oh, I'm so sorry. I couldn't see clearly.""

""I just saw some woman wearing my slippers, using my dishes—I thought she was a thief.""

Piper's face flushed red, looking somewhat guilty: ""I didn't know they were yours...""

But she was obviously lying.

I love cherries—almost everything of mine at home has a cherry symbol on it. If she accidentally wore my slippers, that would be understandable, but to also use my plates, my forks? Too many coincidences? Only a fool would believe she wasn't doing it deliberately.

Seeing that I'd apologized, her expression changed.

She nestled softly in Knox's arms, showing her reddened cheek and tearful eyes: ""I'm sorry, Riley. Even if it was an accident, I shouldn't have touched your things...""

I raised an eyebrow.

Well, well. A professional damsel in distress.

But Knox was clearly falling for it.

He soothingly patted Piper's shoulder, then frowned at me: ""Riley, you've really gone too far this time.""

Then he helped Piper to the guest room to treat her face.

I quickly packed my bags and went straight to a hotel.

Soon after, my phone was blowing up.

""Where did you run off to now?"" Knox's voice was impatient.

My tone was ice-cold: ""Aren't you busy taking care of your little sweetheart? Why are you looking for me?""

Hearing my cold attitude, Knox's tone became angry: ""You caused all this mess and just left? Who else should I look for if not you!""

""Piper's face is swollen. Go buy some ice and bring it back—quickly.""

I just laughed coldly: ""I heard saliva works better for swelling. She'd probably prefer that anyway.""

With that, I hung up immediately.

Then my phone buzzed with a message from my boss: \[Riley, I've arranged everything for your business trip. Your flight is the day after tomorrow in the morning.\]

I calmly replied: \[Thank you. I'll be there on time.\]

After some consideration, I decided to text Knox about it.

Even though I'd decided on divorce, it didn't stop me from being a responsible adult.

While typing in the chat window, my phone buzzed again—it was a WhatsApp friend request notification, sent by someone who added me using my phone number.

The profile picture was a provocative body shot, and the username was ""Queen Piper.""

I instantly knew who it was. No one but her would use such an extravagant name.

But I had never given my phone number to any of Knox's friends.

So, only Knox could have given her my number.

Thinking of this, I accepted the request.

Neither of us spoke, but her moments were rapidly updating with several new posts.

The earliest was from this afternoon.

\[Back in the States! Staying at my best bro's place\~\] The photo showed a table full of food, with the corner revealing a man and woman's hands wearing matching cufflinks.

\[Got hurt by a psycho, and my best bro insisted on going out late at night to buy me medicine.\] The photo showed medicine on a table and a man's hand holding a cotton swab.

\[OMG! I told him he has to give himself to me as compensation, and he didn't object!\] The photo showed a man's back view, apparently passed out on the couch.

I calmly closed my phone and took out my laptop, revising the project materials for the overseas trip.

Everything might betray you, but money never will.

After finishing my project presentation in the conference room,

My boss patted my shoulder encouragingly: ""Great job, Riley. I feel completely confident putting you in charge of this project.""

""Keep it up—there's a bonus in it for you when you finish.""

I thanked him modestly, showing my first genuine smile in days.

After the meeting ended, I was organizing materials to bring tomorrow when I suddenly remembered something—my passport—it's still in the nightstand at home!

So I left work early and took a taxi straight home.

The study highlighted the effective use of secondhand furniture and upcycling, which is a huge win for both the wallet and the habitat. They mentioned finding a beat-up coffee table for next to nothing and wholly refinishing it - that's the kind of project that makes a place feel like home without breaking the bank.

One of the key takeaways for me was the focus on textiles.apparently, they used thrift store curtains and inexpensive throw pillows to add a lot of visual interest and warmth without requiring any major renovations. It makes you realize how much impact soft furnishings can have in transforming a room's atmosphere.

Has anyone else tried similar budget-pleasant decorating methods? What are some of your go-to tips for making a space your own when you're limited by budget or rental restrictions?

You’re a really cute Yandere 🥺

**Summary** : Your boyfriend absolutely adores you—your quirks, your intense affection, and the way you show love. He thought it would be fun (and cute) to share a few of your “love language moments” and funny relationship stories online. But the internet didn’t quite see things the same way. Instead of swooning, people introduced him to a new word he’d never heard before. According to them... you’re definitely a Yandere.

**SCRIPT**

**\[Door opens, Listener enters the room\]** 

*Happy, loving*  
Hey, babe. You're home earlier than I expected—that’s a nice surprise. How was your day ? 

**\[Listener answers and asks about his day\]** 

Oh, so that’s why you got to leave early—lucky you. 

Well, nothing too exciting on my side. I worked from home like I planned. Took a shower, caught up on emails, and finally made some progress on that project I left hanging yesterday. 

For lunch, I had... don’t laugh—potato steak and ice cream. I know, total chaos, but I regret nothing. *Chuckles* 

Then I got back to work, finished the project, cleaned up the plant pot Mister Meow knocked over again—that little menace purposely always does that when I'm home. 

Otherwise, my sister called, we talked for like ten minutes about what to do for Mom’s birthday. And then I had a snack… or at least, I started having one. 

*Amused*  
Look—I didn’t even get to finish it before you walked in. Perfect timing. 

**\[Listener talks about their day\]** 

**\[Listens, but seems distracted during their answer\]** 

Mm-hmm… Yeah… Mmh… 

**\[Listener notices and points it out\]** 

*Apologetic, sweet*  
Oh—sorry, babe. You’re right. I am listening. Or… trying to. I promise I care about your day. 

**\[Listener knows he has something on his mind\]** 

*Gently admitting*  
Okay, yeah… you caught me. Something has been on my mind. 

I just… wasn’t sure if it was even worth bringing up. 

**\[Listener encourages him, asks if he trusts them\]** 

*Soft, reassuring*  
Of course I trust you. Completely. You know that. It’s just... well… 

You know how much I love you, right ? How much I love us ? 

So this morning, I was scrolling through social media, and I ended up on this thread—people were sharing sweet little stories about their partners. Stuff like inside jokes, cute habits, how their love language shows up day-to-day… 

*Affectionate*  
And I thought, “hey, I wanna talk about you too” because you’re amazing, and I’m honestly so lucky. So I shared a few stories—nothing private, just... cute moments. The way you show affection, how thoughtful you are, little things that make me smile and love you. 

**\[Listener is touched\]** 

*Loving, warm*  
Of course you deserve that kind of praise, babe. Always. 

**\[Pauses\]** — *Gentle shift in tone*  
But… well, then the comments started coming in. A lot of comments. 

**\[Listener asks if something’s wrong\]** 

*Careful, kind*  
I wouldn’t say “something wrong”. Just… unexpected. 

There was this one word that kept popping up. A word I didn’t really know before. So I looked it up—just out of curiosity. 

*Softly, cautiously*  
Babe... are you familiar with the term ""Yandere"" ? 

**\[Listener reacts—hurt, confused, a little sad\]** 

*Immediately sweet and comforting*  
Hey, hey—no, no, no. It’s okay. There’s nothing bad happening. I’m not upset and I’m not accusing or attacking you. 

*Careful, still sweet*  
It’s just… when I read through the comments, people kept pointing out these “elements” in your behavior. So I got curious and… yeah. I started seeing the parallels with our dynamic. 

**\[Explains as if it were normal for him\]** — *Casual*  
Like when I explain how we never really go out separately. I mean—when I go out with my friends or family, you always come with me. And if, for some reason, you can’t, you prep my clothes, wear them a little before and even spray them with your perfume—so I still carry a bit of you with me. Apparently… that “possessive.” 

And then there’s how you check the messages I get from anyone who’s not on your personal “safe list.” Some folks called that obsessive. Or intrusive. 

Or even how you always want a full rundown of my day when I get home. What I did, who I saw, what they said, where I went… People said that sounded controlling. 

And this is just on the things I did share. I didn’t even bring up the time with the fitness coach… or the neighbor incident… or that girl at the café who complimented my hair. 

*Soft, careful*  
So yeah... after putting it all together, I guess I kind of agree with them. 

I think you are a Yandere. 

**\[Listener panics a little\]** 

*Soft and calming*  
Hey—hey. Love, it’s okay. Again, no need to panic. Listen to me. I don’t mind. I mean it. I’m not mad or scared. 

**\[Listener asks if he’s serious\]** 

*Gently reassuring, loving tone*  
Of course, I’m serious. 

Yes, you do all those things. Yes, I know that’s not what most people would call “normal.” But I like it. 

Actually… I love it. 

You remember that time when I woke up in the middle of the night and mentioned a dream I had as a kid—some tiny detail from when I was six ? And the very next day, you’d already found the book my mom used to read to me back then ? 

I never even told you the title. You just… knew. In fact I’m pretty sure you already had the book somewhere. 

Most people don’t even know what their partner’s favorite childhood snack was. You, somehow, know exactly how many times I broke a bone as a kid and which wrist it was each time. That’s... kind of amazing. 

Okay, maybe it’s intense. Maybe it’s more than what people are used to. But what’s so wrong with loving someone deeply ? 

People brag all the time about how their partner knows their favorite meal or their coffee order. Their allergies. Their blood type. 

But you ? You go further than that. You see me. You remember everything, not because you have to—because you want to. Because you care and love. 

So if some strangers online don’t get that ? Too bad for them. They don’t see what I see. You’re all mine. I’m all yours. And I love you—exactly the way you are. Even if that means you’re a Yandere. 

**\[Listener tears up, overwhelmed with joy\]** 

*Soft and loving*  
Aww, babe… don’t cry. 

I hope you know there’s nothing to worry about. I’m not going anywhere. 

**\[Opens his arms for a hug\]** — *Sweet*  
Come here. Let me hold you. 

**\[Hugs the Listener tenderly\]** — *Loving*  
That’s it. My love. You’re safe. I’m here. I’m always gonna be here. 

You’re a Yandere… But you’re MY Yandere. 

*Slightly amused, playful*  
And, honestly, judging by some of the stuff I’ve read online—and, uh, let’s be real—how jealous I get whenever someone else makes you laugh… Maybe I’m a little Yandere too. 

**\[Listener reacts with soft laughter\]** 

*Warm chuckle*  
Wouldn’t that be something ? A Yandere couple. We’d be unstoppable. And unbearably cute.

*Soft, dreamy*  
Yeah… that would be perfect. Just like you.

1led9ry,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1led9ry,"I did my first hiking trip, solo. 3 days in Ukrainian Carpathians, 37 km, 2000 m elevation gain. It was great.","TL;DR I went on my (almost) first hiking trip, solo. 3 days, 37 km, 2000 m of elevation gain over Svydovets range in Ukrainian Carpathians. It was great. I prepared myself good enough physically, but it was still every bit as challenging as I wanted it to be. I made some mistakes and took (hopefully) some lessons out of them, but I definitely did a lot of things right too. I’m going backpacking again soon.

…

So, I went on my first trip, solo. Well, almost first: I was on one 4 day trip 8 years ago with all 20+ kilo of equipment borrowed, and a large group, who I had to be catching up to constantly. It was somewhat fun, but well beyond my physical abilities, plus I caught a bug from the water and spent a couple of day after on a toilet. After discovering Kraig Adams’ solo hiking videos a couple of years after, I started dreaming of hiking too. I’ve been dreaming for years, but something always got in the way: pandemic, family problems, the war et cetera et cetera.

This spring, after watching the story of a guy unicycling the world on YouTube, I had a carpe diem moment. I have finally decided to hike. I started preparing myself: got on a calorie deficit (lost 8 kg since March and went from obese to just overweight, hooray!), started training routine of walking exercises, rucking with a loaded pack, climbing stairs every chance I get. I spent an ungodly amount on the equipment. I went for an overnight hike in the vicinity of Kyiv. Didn’t get any sleep on that one due to a missile attack going on and shit being intercepted by air defence and exploding overhead the whole night. But at least I was quite comfortable in my tent, on my pad and under my unzipped bag, as it was quite warm.

At some point, with some help from an experienced friend, I’ve built a route: Svydovets mountain range in the Ukrainian Carpathians, 37 km route with a little over 2000 m of elevation gain over 3 days, with the highest peak of 1883 m.

…

Day 1

On June 2 I got off the train in Kvasy village down in a valley. I was immediately met by border guards, who checked my papers and asked where I’m going. It’s not very close to the border from here, but that’s martial law during wartime for you.

I started hiking up right away, as the trailhead starts right at the railway station. Paradoxically, the hardest stretch on that day were the first 200 m of elevation. After that, something clicked, I found a comfortable pace and kept on steadily going up the muddy trail through forests and meadows, past both the already occupied shepherds huts lower down, and still empty ones higher up.

About mid-day, I reached a tight group of mountain huts on a meadow at about 1350 masl. They are called kolyba in Ukrainian and are used as shepherds houses throughout the warmer months, but this year the winter here really overstayed, so they were still empty at the start of June. I took an opportunity to refresh myself with a spring water there, cooked (well, boiled the water for my dehydrated meals, and fixed a sandwich, lol) and ate some lunch. 

I wandered off the main trail once, but seeing on the map as the side path would merge with the trail further, I went on. There was a sheep herd along with its shepherd. He asked me where I’m going and waved his hand along the path, saying I’m doing alright. I stood there confused for a moment, as the path in the direction he pointed to, was occupied completely by the sheep. The shepherd said to just keep going. I did, and the sheep dispersed in front of me like the Red Sea in front of Moses. After some scrambling on a narrow and slippery side path, it finally re-joined the main trail at the exact place where my planned camping site for the night was supposed to be. It fell through though, as the spring there dried up, but I had a backup one more km further along the way. By about 5 o’clock, I reached the backup campsite. 

During my 10 km (1040 m gain) first day, I have only met half dozen horses, 2 shepherds and some sheep. 

The camping area was very calm and shielded from wind by pines, with some springs coming out of the side of the hill. I walked around, but struggled to find a level enough spot for the tent, while insects were desperately trying to get in my eyes and mouth. After wandering in and around the campsite for a bit, I finally picked what seemed the flattest spot, but having an obvious incline, it was still far from ideal. I unpacked and set up the tent, pumped up my sleeping pad and got the sleeping bag out of the compression sack to regain some loft. I was surprisingly energetic after my first day, so much more than I anticipated, and I had a lot of time in the day still. So before making dinner, I decided to hike up the ridge above the campsite, and climb the hill that I had just traversed on my way. I enjoyed the views, took some photos and was on my way back to my camp when I decided to take a turn to explore an old overgrown side path traversing the next mountain. There I came across a perfectly level stretch of grass right next to a couple of springs gushing out of the rocks. Because of the light breeze on the side of a mountain, there were much less insects hovering in the air too. This place overlooked the camping area I’ve set in, so while down at my tent, I considered what I should do. 

I decided to move. I went back to my tent, thrown all smaller things into my backpack randomly. I took the rain fly off the tent and stuffed it into the pack too. I zipped up the inner tent, leaving the inflated sleeping pad and the bag inside. I got the backpack on and grabbed the tent by the poles and tried to walk holding it in my hands. I only made 50 m. It would have been possible if not for the pad and the bag inside, but it was too heavy as it was, so I was afraid to break the tent poles. I had to put the tent down, and fold and pack the poles too, after all. I grabbed the inner tent with the pad and bag under my arm and walked this way a couple hundred meters to the newly found campsite.

When I finally made camp on the side of the mountain, I finally drank a can of beer that I’ve been carrying this whole day, and cooked and ate my dinner. Then I went to sleep. I was kinda indecisive about unzipping my sleeping bag into a blanket, thinking it might get colder later in the night, so I would need to fiddle with zippers in the light of a headlamp to zip it all up again, but I just ended up hot and not sleeping very good. Oh well…

Day 2

I woke up early. The day started with some deer showing up during my breakfast and walking past me no more than 50 m away. They certainly noticed me, stopped to take a look (and a sniff), but didn’t care. As I was finishing packing my camp, a dog appeared, not a very friendly one. Then, a herd of sheep. And only then - one of the shepherds from yesterday along with a couple more dogs. We had a chat, wished each other a good day and headed our separate ways, with sheep ravaging what just 10 min ago was my campsite. I after a little of elevation gain, I had a good long almost level walk along the ridge until the point where it merges into the main, higher part of the Svydovets range. As I was slowly climbing a steep slope, the weather kept getting harsher. The wind was stiffening, and clouds were getting closer. After steep 400 m, I’ve finally reached the main ridge, finding myself almost in the clouds. By this point, the wind became brutal, and the clouds were worrying as I didn’t want to be caught up in a thunderstorm up top. I kept stopping to put more clothes on, as I have started in shorts and a shirt, but now with no more elevation gain, colder temperatures higher up and with the wind, I kept getting cold. As I went along the ridge, one by one I reached 2 highest summits on my route of a little under 1900 m: mountains Blyznytsia (a Twin from Ukrainian) and Blyznytsia Velyka (a Big Twin). The gusts were becoming stronger still, now draining my energy and making my wrists hurt as they were trying to blow away my hiking poles. I finally met a hiking group, who were mostly kids with some adults and a guide, day hiking from a nearby ski resort, where I was heading. By noon, my route was still following the ridge, but now was mostly downhill. I was walking along some ski lifts, now sitting like bare skeletons on the grassy slope. 

By early afternoon I finally reached the ski resort cafe in the saddle of the ridge. I’ve had some hot Borshcht, deruny (a fried potato dish kinda similar to hashbrowns) and drank some coffee; used a bathroom (a real toilet and running water are truly a pinnacle of modern civilization!). I bummed a smoke (guilty, I know. I quit last year, but can a fella have a comfort smoke once in a while?) from some guys who turned out to be going the same direction as I was. Spending about 2 hours total in the cafe, I anticipated the rest of my day. It was afternoon already, and I still had half my trek to the campsite to go, although without much elevation gain. The weather forecast showed some rain, but you couldn’t really tell what’s coming, as clouds just kept coming and going across the ridge. The route after the cafe started with a saddle and the mountain Stih. It wasn’t tall, only about 150 m or so above the saddle, but steep. My gut was telling me to traverse it along a dirt road, saving some time and energy, but I stubbornly shut it up and decided to stick to the plan and climb up. A mistake, as it later became clear. 

I went out of the cafe and walked along the saddle. As I was traversing it, the wind reached its peak for my trip. I could barely walk as it was blowing into my side. I was placing both my trekking poles diagonally to my right, feeling that if I stumble, the wind would just throw me onto the ground. Sometimes, the gusts were getting so strong, that I couldn’t move at all. I was started to think how I will have to just try to lay down head to the wind, probably leave my backpack and crawl back to the cafe if it gets any stronger, or else it might just blow be off the ridge. I managed to cross the saddle and started going up the Stih. The wind was still strong, but at least the gusts weren’t so strong anymore. As I was going up, the first rainstorm flew in, quickly turning into a hail. My left pant quickly got wet, and water was pouring down the pant right into my boot. I reached the top and started descending on the other side right away, without even taking a selfie as the rain kept pouring and I was anxious to be at the top in such weather, especially with a lightning rod on the peak. I descended into the next saddle on the ridge. As I kept going, the rain finally stopped, so I stopped too and took my boot off to pour the puddle out of it and to wring my socks off a bit. The whole going up and down the Stih and trying to minimize the wetness in my shoes took maybe 30-45 min of my time, and I was starting to get tired. But I had to keep pushing, as it was getting late. After a couple more kilometers I met the guys who I met in the cafe earlier. They headed out before I did, managed to go where they planned to, got caught in the rain too, and now were on the way back to the cafe. One of the guys was quite funny looking. He was military, I assume on his time off. He was wearing his uniform camo pants, boots and cap. And a bright pink North Face shell jacket xD. After having a chat, we went our separate ways.

I finally reached a point on the route, where I finally had to get off the ridge down to a mountain lake some 400 meters below. The thing is, the marked trail leading there was supposed to be borderline technical even when well maintained in the past. Now, early in the season after the winter overstayed its welcome this year (it still snowed 2 weeks earlier, in the middle of May), it might have been plainly dangerous for someone as inexperienced as I. I had planned a fallback trail down for that occasion, and it was exactly how it went. The marked trail looked scary, and as I was looking at my backup trail curling downhill on a spur in the distance, it seemed like a good idea to head there instead.

I had one problem. To get to the spur that the backup route was going down off, I had to summit and cross the top of a minor mountain on the main ridge, but the weather was not looking promising once again. As I closing on the said mountain, it started pouring cats and dogs again, but this time I heard the thunderstorm too. I couldn’t risk going atop of the ridge in the thunderstorm. I had to just keep walking past, looking for some pit in the terrain to wait out the storm safely. I found one along the path and squatted there under the hale hitting me with the gusts of wind, hurting even through my rain jacket. Some quarter (or maybe half) hour later, it finally stopped pouring, but the clouds were still hiding the top of the mountain I needed to hop over, and thunder kept rolling in the distance.

As I was walking around anxiously, it was getting uncomfortably late. I had maybe 2 or 2 1/2 hours till the sunset, but I still had to go over 400 m down by what I now expected to be muddy and slippery slope after all the rain. I couldn’t even get to the top of said slope yet because of the storm. I kinda started panicking and questioning my life choices. Then I tried to explore the map on my phone for alternative camping sites, also considering going back to the ski resort that I passed earlier in the day. I would get there by nightfall if I started walking back now, but at least I knew that the path is easy and safe that way, so I would be ok walking it with a headlamp.

The clouds were breaking up and sometimes there were some patches of clear blue skies. But despite of there being sunny in the direction the clouds were rolling from, the ridge was making its own weather. As the air mass stumbled at the ridge, it had to quickly climb several hundred meters up, where the moisture was rapidly condensing and clouds were appearing seemingly out of nowhere. Still, the top of the mountain cleared up, so I went for it. As I was going up, I heard thunder again, turned around and quickly hopped down the hill back to safety. Once again, I was waiting for it to clear up.

Finally, it did. As I finally started seeing clear skies right above me, I had no time to waste. I quickly hiked over the mountain and started going down along the spur on the other side. The path was steep and slippery, with some stretches eroded by rains, but I was still very happy to be making progress again, as I was seeing the turquoise water of lake Vorozheska 400 m down below. Some tiny tents could be seen near it, as well as some people, who looked like ants from such height.

With the help of my trusty hiking poles, I made my way down with about an hour to spare before sundown. I walked around choosing a place, and started setting my tent up. The people, who looked like ants from up above, now came over from their camp to say hi. Seeing how exhausted I am, as I struggled to pitch my tent’s footprint in the wind, they helped me a little and invited me to join them for dinner. I gladly took up at the invitation. After the tent was set up and I unpacked, I grabbed my food and stove and headed over to their camp, now wrapped in my puffy and wearing slippers after spending a whole afternoon in wet shoes.

My neighbours turned out to be lovely. They were a group of 7, who knew each other forever. Some of the older people there met in the 80s during mountaineering adventures in the mountains of central Asia, while the countries there were part of the USSR. Others joined later. As they treated me with soup and brandy, sitting by the fire I heard what felt like countless stories of the times gone by. One by one, most of the group left for the night, so I too wished goodnight to those who stayed. 

I walked to my camp, crawled into the tent and prepared to go to sleep. This time, I knew that nights are warm, so I tried to unzip my sleeping bag into a blanked mode. But the damn zipper was stuck, and I was too exhausted to try to fix it in the torch light. I got into the bag and tried to sleep. It was hot again. As I was falling asleep, I felt like was coming down with a fever. I was shivering and sweating like I had a flu. Thankfully, I wasn’t. I was just flustered with the day I went through, probably dehydrated and low on blood sugar despite having dinner.

Day 3

I slept in. As the sun shined over the ridge and onto my tent, I woke up and got out to some beautiful weather. Everything was a little damp, but was quickly drying up in the sun and a light breeze. The sky was clear with some lone clouds here and there. I stretched my legs walking around the camp and had my breakfast on an improvised bench overlooking the lake. I saw that my neighbours were up too, so after breakfast I headed to their camp to say hi and had some coffee with them. I returned to my tent and finished packing. With a pack behind my back, I popped in one more time to thank everyone for hospitality, said my goodbyes and started my final descent to the finish. I had 13 km and nearly 1000 m down to go, and I wanted to catch a beer in a pub before boarding my train back. 

Up high, it was stellar. I was going downhill through flowery meadows among the pine trees, with nearly a dozen streams flowing across the path for every kilometer. But as I was descending, the forest was becoming thicker and vistas rarer. I was getting more and more tired, but I had to keep moving to make it in time for my beer. After wearing the damp shoes for the second day, for the first during the trip I had to stop to handle some hot points on my feet, so that they wouldn’t become blisters. As I followed the path through the forests, I was finding myself more and more not just tired, but physically exhausted from the continuous effort during these days. Nothing really hurt in my body, I wasn’t sore much, but I barely dragged my feet. I could barely think and felt like I risked stumbling and falling down the slope. I still had some sugary snacks, but eating them didn’t achieve anything, unlike the previous days. I figured I must be dehydrated. I was drinking a lot as I had easy access to water in my drinking bladder for the whole trip, but I may have became low on micro elements as I was sweating this whole time. About 2/3 of my way down, as I was reassured I’m gonna make it in time, I allowed myself to stop for a break before I fall, and have quick lunch. This time I didn’t cook a meal, but got out every salty snack that I had left in my pack, and chewed through them. With salt and half an hour rest, I felt much better, so I went on down.

I had the trail end village in sight already. I stopped for a bit, turned on my phone and started dialing numbers of all the taxi drivers one by one. No Uber in these parts, so I googled all the taxi drivers in the area before heading out and saved them on my phone. The second phone number was a success, so I made arrangements with Mykola to pick me up down in the village an hour later. Around this time I was also reminded that I shouldn’t had neglected sun protection, as the skin on my calves was burning every time the sun shined on it. Anyway, I went on along the more and more eroded trail down to the village. In 40 minutes I was finally there, passing a horse who was chewing on its grass, passing a bridge over rambling Chorna Tysa river. I made it to the finish.

Mykola came to pick me up and drove me the whole 40 km back to a village back at trailhead where started from 3 days earlier. As we were driving along the road through a narrow valley, I looked at the speedometer, which showed 90 km/h, and I put my hand out of the open window. “Yeah”, - I thought - “that feels about right”. I figured the wind up on the ridge was about the same speed as we were now going in a car.

Mykola dropped me off near the Tsypa brewery, where I had 2 cold and refreshing pints of lager. I was in heaven. A couple of hours later I boarded my overnight sleeper train back to Kyiv and was home the next day before noon.

…

As I’ve been reflecting on my trip, I realised I made a couple of major mistakes that made my way much harder than it could’ve been.

Mistake 1: I kept stopping during the first part of the day. First to catch some cell service to post  stories on Instagram and sending out pics to friends. I’m not very active on social media, but the emotions from the hike and the natural beauty around me were so overwhelming that I couldn’t stop myself from trying to share them. Then I was stopping several times while climbing up the ridge and on the ridge, as the weather kept getting harsher and I was getting cold. I should have understood better what clothes I needed to wear to stay comfortable, and not to keep stopping to put some more. This stopping and getting started again unnecessarily drained my energy comparing to if I just kept hiking in steady pace.

Mistake 2: That damn Stih! While I was still in the cafe in the middle of my second day, my gut was telling me to traverse it. But no. I ignored it and let my stubbornness take over. I went up despite already being tired, and lost 30-45 minutes getting up and down, and handling puddles in my shoes after the shower I got into there. Consequently, 30 minutes (or even less!) would have been all that I needed to pass that mountain later on to make it to the spur before the rain with a thunderstorm rolled in. If I hadn’t climbed the damn Stih, I would have probably been chilling near the fire with that awesome group of people full 2 hours earlier than I did, and wouldn’t be nearly as exhausted at the end of the day. I might would have even figured out the zipper on my sleeping bag if I made camp earlier, so my night would be much more pleasant.

What lessons do I take out of all these experiences I’ve had along the trail?

* Trust your gut. I felt I would benefit from a shortcut, but didn’t take it and ended up more exhausted, missed
* Stop less. Every stop drops down your heart rate, making it harder to keep going while it’s getting pumping again
* Try to anticipate what you’ll need to be wearing in advance. I knew to start cold to be comfortable going up later. Now I also know when it might me time to put some more wind protection than I need right now, as I know I’ll be needing it half an hour later
* Look where you’re stepping at, especially on the descent. I’m a city kid, so I’m used to level sidewalks and smooth park paths. I’ve never lived anywhere near the mountains, so I don’t have it as a habit to look under my feet. So as I was going, I constantly found myself getting distracted by the view or even by my own thoughts, and failing to pay attention to the trail as the result. I nearly tripped and fallen probably half a dozen times during the hike. A couple of times during my descent to the lake on the second day, I caught myself distracted on a narrow and slippery trail with near vertical cliffs on either sides. I was properly terrified as I realised that being distracted there could as well cost me my life. I promised myself to make an active effort to stay focused on the trail during descents and dangerous parts such as this
* Take your time picking a camping spot
* Don’t waste your time trying to share what you’re experiencing on social media in real time. It’s useless. It’s what you’re getting away from in the first place. Just be present, be aware of your surroundings, just be. By the end of the trip this mindset was already full on. I didn’t really want to get on Instagram or anywhere else by the time I finished. I was happy inside my own head
* A couple of minor gear issues to figure out (like the water coming down my pants into the shoes during the rainstorm, a stuck zipper on my sleeping bag, packing), but overall I was quite happy with what I had equipment wise

I do also have to say kudos to me, actually! There are things that I had done right:

* I trained well. I love walking, but I’ve been extremely out of shape since forever. This thing has finally given me the push to get better. I’ve lost and I’m continuing to lose weight. I’m eating healthy. I exercise every day, even after the trip. I will probably join the gym right after the next trip. I also plan to start running once I’m not so overweight, but I don’t want to hurt my knees starting running too early
* I somewhat learned how to hike beforehand. I watched a lot of hiking videos and read a lot here on reddit, but the single most valuable thing I learned as I was preparing for the trip, was how to walk properly (huuuge shout out to The Map Reading Company channel and the “Walk up hills without getting tired” video on the topic!). Might sound silly for you hiking lot, but for me it was crucial to become conscious of how I’m moving and applying my limited energy. I didn’t expect to crush the 900 m elevation gain on my first day so easily
* I went alone. Sounds debatable, but I’m glad I did. I love people and socializing, don’t get me wrong, but I like being alone too. I took this as a chance to be present off the grid, to take on a challenge on my own, and to reflect on my life in general. Being able to go at my own (slow) pace was what allowed the trip not to be exhausting until much later. I have some friends who I’ll be happy to hike with if they decide to tag along, but I’m just as happy to be hiking by myself.
* In spite of a few shortcomings, I’ve chosen the equipment well. The pack (Osprey Atmos LT 50) was holding weight like it wasn’t there for the whole trip, the tent (Big Agnes Copper Spur HV UL2 Long) is light and roomy (I’m a tall boy at 194 cm), the rain jacket (Outdoor Research Foray II) kept me dry but not toasty, the boots (Scarpa Rush 2 Mid GTX) were light and didn’t give me any blisters, the trekking poles (MSR Dynalock Ascent Carbon) made the hike so much easier that I wouldn’t want to go without them. A Garmin watch, that I’ve gotten right before the trip, helped with stress free navigation a lot by just giving me a piece of mind with a glance on my wrist, and informing me if I strayed off route.
* I didn’t overpack much. I did end up with a bit of food left, but otherwise I’ve worn and used almost every thing I took, especially the heavier ones. My base weight is about 11 kilo. Not ultralight, but pretty decent
* I planned the route well. My experienced friend has only pointed me to this mountain range as a great place to start, but I did all the research and planned the route on my own. I did ask him to take a look at the final route just in case I made some mistake planning, but it only got his approval
* I made it, after all, and I liked it!

As I’m writing this, I already have the next trip in mind. The highest range in Ukraine - Chornohora. Petros mountain (4th tallest in Ukraine, 2020 m), Nesamovyte lake, Shpytsi rock formation. About the same distance, but a lot more elevation gain on the first day, and chill walk on the next two. It also will be interesting to try and recall my experience from 8 years ago as a part of the route on the second day will overlap with the route back then.

I’m a young man just trying to live a normal life, but things have completely spun out of control. I have no money, no friends, and no real support from my family. Even simple things—like buying a new pair of shoes or sitting in a coffee shop—have become luxuries I can’t afford.

I feel completely stuck and like there’s no way out. Sometimes I hate myself, I hate my life, and I feel like nobody sees me or understands me.
Even trying has become hard… just thinking about my future exhausts me.

To be honest, I feel so helpless that I couldn't even find the words to write this myself. I asked ChatGPT to help me say what I’m feeling, because I didn’t know how to start.

I’m not looking for magical solutions, just honest words from people who’ve been through something similar.

AITA for hiding the windfall?,"I am 26. When I was a kid my aunt worked at a toy shop and used her staff discount to grab first print Marvel and DC issues right off the rack. She bagged and boxed everything for me because I was too young to care and the boxes ended up in her basement. She passed away last spring. While clearing her place I opened the crates, saw a mint Amazing Spider Man 300 and a bunch of other keys, and nearly fell over.

I sent the best ones to CGC, ran a quiet auction, and after fees the payout was six hundred eighty something thousand. I moved it straight into an index fund and a high yield savings account. Nobody knows except the auction house and the tax man. I still live in the same small apartment with my partner, two rooms, eight hundred each for rent, split groceries on Venmo, still argue over takeout versus cooking rice at home.

She has about fifteen grand on credit cards at ridiculous interest and sometimes skips coffee to make the minimum. Last week her laptop died and she cried because a replacement will wipe her emergency fund. I offered fifty toward it like I always do and she hugged me like I had saved the day.

Friends think I am broke too. They tease me for using coupons and bringing water instead of buying beer at the park. I like it that way. No one pitches me their business ideas or asks for loans. But each time I watch my partner pay late fees I feel like a liar.

I keep telling myself I will confess when we get engaged or when we move but the right moment never comes. The secret keeps growing and every pizza we split feels heavier than the last.

So am I the asshole for acting poor while the person I love drowns in debt or is it fair to keep my money private until I am ready to talk?",10,1750240905.0,AITAH,12,0.92,False

Guys,

I am mad, sad and confused. 

Here is what happened:
1. He followed a young attractive girl 7 weeks ago, who works at the coffee show, because he says she is also a BEGINNER tattoo artist and he has lots of tattoos. Later on he said he hasn't had a new tattoo is 6 years.
2. She followed him back later that day.
3. They sent each other messages. When I asked to see the conversation, he said he had deleted it because he says he often deletes conversations.
4. He still followed her after deleting the conversation. 
5. I made him unfollow her.

We talked about the situation 4-5 times already. I am still not feeling completely okay with it. It makes me angry and sad. It makes me feel like I have been betrayed.

Can someone please give me any advice on what's the right thing to do?

Not with the way she was rushing to get her activities for the season in last second.

Aubrey tried not to let that plague her mind while she cooked that morning though. It was a celebration after all! For the end of Spring and the start of her favourite season: Summer. 

That was the idea behind the brunch, to have a meal based around the gifts of the West Wind, though cooking with ingredients grown only in Spring proved to be a challenge; but not one Aubrey wasn't up to! So with the help of some nymphs and a cookbook from the athena, she got to work.

I don't usually post on reddit so excuse grammar or bad writing.
So I made this new friend at the start of the year; met him trough a mutual friend. We always kind of knew each other but we really started hanging out this year.  We clicked and talked easily, even though we don't share almost any interests or hobbies. We're very different but maybe that's what makes the friendship good. Sometimes we run out of topics to talk about but all in all it's a good time. Anyway, even though we are friends for 6 months now I feel like I barely know him.

I went for coffee with thim and his friends and found out he was veery different in the past. Lots of bad habits like smoking and borderline concerning behaviour. This shocked me for a bit but I moved on and rationalized that he's a very different person now. While asking him about it even he acknowleged his past behaviour and said he's glad he changed.

Anyway that had me questioning for a bit but I decided to get over it because why judge someone who changed.

Anyway here comes the problem. Recently we went out and did something different. We went on a 11km walk that lasted 2+ hours. Naturally, we talked and got to know eachother better. I learned that he doesn't really have any long term friends or a friendgroup (I didn't expect this since he says hi and talks to a lot of people when we're out and also on the bus). He told me he feels his closest friends (which he didn't want to invite out with us which I suggested) don't really like him that much. He said people become boring after w ahile because you run out of things to talk aobout. He also has the same oppinion on our mutual friend who is kind of a douche. The dude never initiates conversation first and we always ask to go out first, what you would call a one sided friendship. Also we had some deep talks and thats when it got weird. I asked about him changing and we talked about it for a bit, then after seeing a cat I started randomly talking about animals. Then I learned he before had lots of 🌽 videos that include bestiality. I was startled for a bit but he assured that he was like that before. Then I learned that sometimes he like pins his cat and (he said she doesn't like it but he does it anyway) forcefully pets her ""pleasure part"" above the tail. He noted that she isn't usually as strong as in the moments she squirms to escape. This had me completely shocked. My jaw was open wide and I wasn't saying anything for a whole minute. After that he just tried to laugh it off and told me to forget it. The rest of the hangout we talked normally but this didn't leave my mind.

Now I'm fully questioning him. He's a good friend but this had me beyond distraught. I don't even know what advice I'm asking for since I don't want to stop being friends but this changed the way I see him now.",2,1750240672.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

Author: Robert Gilmore based of the memory of an old story by Keith Gilmore

# Chapter 1: The Gathering

The summer of 1993 hung heavy over Easton, Massachusetts. The kind of thick, syrupy heat that made vinyl car seats a torture device and turned living rooms into sanctuaries from the sweltering sun. In one such house on 59 Summer Street, four friends had gathered around a 19-inch Zenith television, the blue light from the screen casting eerie shadows across their faces.

""Finish him!"" the television blared as Keith, lanky and barely twenty, frantically mashed the buttons on his Sega Genesis controller. He was playing as Raiden.

""Dude, you're so dead,"" laughed Bobby, slouched on the threadbare couch, a half-eaten bag of Doritos balanced on his knee. Bobby was playing as Scorpion. ""Come here!!!""

Joey, the youngest at seventeen, sat cross-legged on the floor, controller in hand, manning Liu Kang with excited anticipation. Pat Moran, eyes narrowed and fingers flying, was controlling Sub-Zero with methodical precision.

The room smelled of pizza, bong water, and the particular musk of young men who considered deodorant optional. Empty Rolling Rock and Budweiser bottles formed a small glass city on the coffee table, alongside rolling papers and a small plastic baggie.

None of them noticed the large black and white cat watching from the hallway, his yellow eyes reflecting the screen's glow like twin moons.

Bob, the father of Bobby and Joey, was a single dad who had long since given up trying to understand the chaos that erupted in his living room. He was probably watching TV in his bedroom, ignoring the ruckus below and placing his trust in his sons to not burn the house down.

# Chapter 2: The Beast

Domino was not an ordinary cat. At eighteen pounds, he was a behemoth—a midnight-and-snow-colored juggernaut with paws the size of coasters and a tail that could knock over a lamp with casual indifference. Bob, Bobby and Joey’s father, had adopted him from the shelter three years ago, where his cage had been emblazoned with a warning: ""Caution: Moody.""

That was like calling Godzilla ""slightly temperamental.""

Tonight, Domino was hungry. Bob had left feeding duties to Bobby, who, currently executing a flawless fatality as Scorpion, had forgotten that responsibility for the second day in a row.

The cat's stomach growled, a low rumble that vibrated through his substantial frame. His pupils dilated as he watched the oblivious teenagers, the scent of their forgotten pizza slices wafting through the room like a siren's call.

# Chapter 3: Descent

""Yo, pass the controller,"" said Joey, reaching for another slice of cold pepperoni. ""I wanna show you guys this new combo I figured out.""

""In your dreams,"" replied Keith, still frantically working the controller. ""I'm on a streak.""

The hallway door creaked open wider, though none of them noticed. Domino entered one pawstep at a time, his massive frame moving with eerie silence. The teenagers' attention remained fixed on the pixelated violence unfolding on screen, their reflexes dulled by the evening's recreational activities.

On the television, blood spurted in blocky red pixels as Kano ripped out his opponent's heart. The room erupted in cheers and groans.

""That's so fake,"" laughed Joey. ""Real blood doesn't look like that.""

""How would you know what real blood looks like?"" Bobby snorted, reaching for the bong. ""The only blood you've seen is when you get a paper cut from your X-Men comics.""

# Chapter 4: The Attack

It happened fast. One moment, the boys were arguing over whose turn was next; the next, eighteen pounds of feline fury launched into their midst with a yowl that sounded like a demon escaping hell.

""What the—"" Bobby's exclamation cut short as Domino landed squarely on his chest, claws extended, eyes wild.

The pizza slice in Joey’s hand became the first casualty, torn from his grasp by needle-sharp teeth. But Domino was just getting started. With the agility that belied his bulk, he sprang to the coffee table, sending Rolling Rock bottles flying and the bong crashing to the floor.

""Grab him!"" shouted Keith, jumping up only to trip over the Genesis controller cord, yanking the console off the shelf. The game froze mid-fatality, Scorpion's spear suspended in digital limbo.

Joey tried to intervene, reaching for the cat with both hands. Domino responded by attaching himself to Joey's forearm like a furry buzzsaw, back legs kicking in that special disemboweling motion cats reserve for their most hated enemies.

""Get it off! Get it off!"" Joey screamed, flailing his arm while Domino held fast, riding the human limb like a rodeo cowboy.

Keith, in a moment of panic-induced clarity, grabbed a couch cushion as a shield. ""It's possessed!"" he shrieked, backing toward the hallway. ""Domino is freaking possessed!""

# Chapter 5: Chaos Reigns

The living room devolved into chaos. Bobby, recovered from the initial shock, tried to save what remained of the pizza by holding the box above his head. This only made him a more tempting target. Domino released Joey's now-bleeding arm and launched himself upward, using Bobby's Led Zeppelin t-shirt as a climbing wall.

""My face! Not my face!"" Bobby wailed as Domino reached his shoulder, then used it as a springboard to reach the pizza box.

The box, unable to support the weight of a cat that ate like he was preparing for hibernation, collapsed. Bobby, Domino, and pepperoni slices rained down together in a chaotic tangle.

Keith, seeing an opportunity, lunged with a blanket. ""I'll get him!""

His heroic moment was short-lived. Domino dodged with supernatural reflexes, and Keith ended up tackling Bobby instead. Both boys went down hard, knocking over the TV tray that held their drinks.

Budweiser splashed across the Sega Genesis.

""The console!"" Joey cried in genuine anguish as the system sparked and died, taking Mortal Kombat with it.

Domino, meanwhile, had claimed his prize. With a pizza slice clamped firmly in his jaws, he darted under the couch, yellow eyes gleaming in triumph from the darkness.

# Chapter 6: The Aftermath

Fifteen minutes later, the living room of 59 Summer Street looked like a war zone. The television displayed nothing but static. The Genesis lay in a sticky puddle of beer. Pizza toppings decorated the carpet like pepperoni polka dots. And four shell-shocked teenagers nursed various scratches, contemplating their life choices.

""Your cat,"" Joey said, pressing a paper towel to the scratches on his arm, ""is a psychopath.""

Bobby, sporting a spectacular scratch across his cheek, could only nod. ""Mom always said he had 'personality.'""

""Personality? That thing is like if Hannibal Lecter was reincarnated as a cat,"" Keith muttered, trying unsuccessfully to reconnect the Genesis to the TV.

Joey, who had escaped relatively unscathed by virtue of hiding behind the furnace, emerged cautiously. ""Is it gone?""

As if in answer, they heard a strange sound from behind the closet door—a rhythmic scratching followed by what could only be described as the feline equivalent of a satisfied sigh.

""Oh God,"" Bobby groaned, recognition dawning. ""He's using the storage closet as a litter box.""

# Chapter 7: Sweet Dreams

While the teenagers contemplated the disaster behind them, Domino had finished his business behind the closet door. With the precision of a cat who knew exactly how inconvenient he wanted to be, he had buried his deposit under a stack of Bob's vintage vinyl records. The stink, potent and unapologetic, wafted out like a silent rebuke.

He exited the closet with the slow, satisfied swagger of a creature who knew he'd made his point. His hunger sated, his territorial marking complete, Domino padded silently through the hallway, past the kitchen where his empty food bowl sat accusingly on the floor, and up the second flight of stairs to the master bedroom.

With a graceful leap that belied his size, he landed on the king-sized bed, turning three precise circles before settling into the exact center of Bob’s pillow. He began to purr, a rumbling sound like a small engine idling.

In the morning, Bobby would find him here, looking innocent and angelic in sleep. He would fill the food bowl, cursing under his breath. The living room would be cleaned, the Genesis mourned, the closet aired out.

But for now, Domino slept the sleep of the just and victorious, dreaming of his next conquest, his black and white tail twitching occasionally as he chased digital ninjas through his dreams.

I’ve been working as a part-time member of the Coles Services team for the past three months. The work itself isn't too difficult if I get to work with decent teammates. However, I've been facing some challenges with our team leader that I feel are important to share and rant about. None of the team members like him across all 3 stores he oversees. Here are some things that have been going on:

1. He changes the roster without any confirmation. I'm on an 18-hour contract. He changed my working hours from 7 hours per day, 3 days a week, to 5 hours per day, 4 days a week. I said I've got uni to attend and he said: he's gonna have to reduce my contract hours. I used to take an extra 2 hours for the same job one week ago, and now he tells me to complete those tasks within the timeframe of 5 hours, as he increased my working days and reduced the number of hours per day. 

2. He is biased. He has his favorite team members who have been working for a year or more. He takes some of them for 2-3 hours coffee breaks, and they just disappear while I and some other team members have to do all the work. Those team members who go with him are always commanding me to do this and that, and all of their work. They work in pairs to finish the same tasks that a single person can do, while I have to put extra time and effort. He changes the shifts for them as per their liking, and the rest of us have to suffer uncommunicated roster changes. 

3. He has the login credentials for MyColes for many team members, and he changes contracted hours without the team members' consent. This has happened with many team members, and no one has ever reported it. Is this even legal?

4. He verbally abuses team members who share the same background as him, including cursing and dismissive behavior. He never acknowledges with a yes or no when asked for sick leave. He tells us to plan the sick leave a few weeks ahead. He never listens to any explanation we give. He stops us halfway and tells us that's enough every single time.

5. He does store transfers and moves team members who advocate for themselves to a busy store and makes them work harder. I’ve heard from some team members that the team leader says he does this to “teach them a lesson,” which really doesn’t sit right with many of us.

  
I know this might sound like a lot, and I’m not trying to overcomplain but these things are making it tough for us. All we’re really asking for is fairness, respect, and a more supportive work environment. Around 6–7 of us are thinking of reporting this to the Area Manager.

Exfoliation can really help your skin, but even pros can mess it up sometimes. It’s not just about not going overboard; there are some surprising tips that can really make a difference. Whether you’re into acids, enzymes, or scrubs, these tips will help you exfoliate the right way.

Here are some dos and don’ts for exfoliation:

**Don’t Exfoliate on Wet Skin (If You’re Using Acids/ chemical exfoliants)**

When your skin is wet, the outer layer of your skin also known as stratum corneum gets a bit puffy and more open to allow products to enter. Using acids like AHAs or BHAs on damp skin can be risky because they can go way too deep into the skin and cause irritation, burns, or damage to your skin barrier.

So, the trick is to always use chemical exfoliants like AHAs or BHAs on completely dry skin. Just wait about 5 minutes after washing your face before applying.

**Do Use Enzymes Before Using Retinol**

Enzymes like papain from papaya, bromelain from pineapple, and pumpkin enzymes help break down dead skin cells without any scrubbing. This leaves your skin surface smoother, so retinol can soak in better, evenly and work more effectively.

To do this effectively, put on your enzyme mask or cleanser, like a Pumpkin Enzyme Mask. Then rinse it off and then apply your retinol. A little tip: enzymes are great for sensitive skin that doesn’t do well with acids and retinol mixed together.

**Don’t Mix Glycolic Acid and Vitamin C**

Glycolic acid works best at a certain pH level, and vitamin C needs a lower pH.  As a result there is a pH clash. Glycolic acid working at  a pH range of 3 to 4, and vitamin C needing a slightly lower pH range of less than 3.5. When you mix them, you can destabilize vitamin C and increase skin irritation due to low pH overlap.

To solve this, you’ll need a small morning evening skincare routine, where in the morning, you apply vitamin C to clean, dry skin, then put on sunscreen. In the evening, you use glycolic acid as a [facial toner ](https://makhzan.ae/collections/toners)or treatment, followed by an[ everyday moisturizer.](https://makhzan.ae/products/plantus-moistskin-natural-everyday-face-cream)

Note: Some vitamin C forms, like THD ascorbate, work well with AHAs.

**Use a Coffee Scrub for Elbows and Knees Right After a Shower**

Taking a hot shower helps soften your skin and opens your pores, even in tougher spots for better exfoliation. Using coffee grounds can gently scrub away dead skin smoothen rough areas, and the caffeine in it gives your skin a little lift for tightening the skin temporarily.

You can make your own DIY [coffee scrub](https://makhzan.ae/products/miara-essence-coffee-scrub-natural-coffee-scrub) at home:

* Mix 2 tablespoons of coffee grounds with 1 tablespoon of coconut oil/olive oil and 1 teaspoon of honey.
* Massage it onto your damp skin. Please make sure your skin is not too wet. Then after the coffee scrub massager, rinse it off, and follow up with your [lightweight moisturizer.](https://makhzan.ae/products/oil-control-moisturizer-mattifying-face-cream)

Just a heads-up: try to stick to this treatment 1 to 2 times a week to avoid any irritation from over-scrubbing. Also be careful using  coffee grounds on the face as coffee grounds can be too abrasive for facial skin.

**So how do I exfoliate based on my Skin Type**

Here is what works best

* Oily or Acne-Prone Skin: Use BHAs like Salicylic Acid at 0.5 to 2%. These helps clear out your pores by breaking down oil and dead skin. You can also incorporate clay and enzyme masks. A mix of kaolin clay and papaya enzymes keeps your face from getting too oily without drying it out. Niacinamide is also good for oil control and calming. Not forgetting [gentle physical scrubs ](https://makhzan.ae/collections/coffee-scrubs)once a week: Just be sure to use gentle scrubs with fine jojoba beads or rice bran powder to keep your pores clear. Tip: Exfoliate skin about 3 to 4 times a week, switching between BHA and enzymes. Just don’t go overboard with it, or it might actually make your skin produce more oil.
* Dry or Flaky Skin: Your best exfoliants  for flaky skin are lactic acid at 5 to 10%. Lactic acid is great for keeping your skin hydrated while helping to remove dead skin. You can also work with Urea at 5%. This one’s gentle and helps break down dead skin while adding moisture to dehydrated skin. Creamy scrubs and sugar scrubs with oils like almond or squalane work well. Tips: Try to exfoliate once or twice a week, especially on dry areas like your cheeks and chin. Don’t forget to put on a ceramide moisturizer afterward to help keep your skin hydrated. Please also note that sugar scrubs as [body exfoliators ](https://makhzan.ae/collections/body-scrub)should be extremely fine and should not be overused for physical exfoliation as they can cause micro-tears.
* Sensitive or Rosacea Skin: Your best bets for reactive skin are PHAs like Gluconolactone and Lactobionic Acid. These ingredients have bigger molecules, so they're less likely to irritate your skin. You can also work with oatmeal or rice powder scrubs as they are gentle and soothing while helping to smooth your skin. Mandelic Acid at 5% will work as an anti-inflammatory  for redness prone skin and is easy your sensitive skin. A few tips: Exfoliate once a week, but skip it if your skin is sensitive. Stay away from products with fragrances, alcohol, and those gritty face scrubs. Always patch-test acids on your jawline before using them all over. Also, avoid hot water and always moisturize afterwards  to keep your skin healthy because your skin is very sensitive to temperature and dryness.
* Combination Skin: Use Azelaic Acid at 10%. This exfoliating acid helps to exfoliate and reduce redness and is perfect for the T-zone and dry cheeks. You can also work with pumpkin enzymes as they give gentle enzyme exfoliation without drying your skin out. Try out dual-sided pads and Use BHA for oily spots like acid exfoliation for your forehead and nose, and lactic acid for drier areas. Tip: Exfoliate skin 2 to 3 times a week and feel free to change it up based on what your skin needs.
* Mature Skin: Try Glycolic Acid at 5 to10%. This acid exfoliation helps with collagen production and getting rid of dead skin cells. Use retinol and enzymes and remember to start with the enzymes to prep your skin. You can try micro-dermabrasion to [tackle fine lines.](https://makhzan.ae/products/antiaging-serum-for-fine-lines-and-wrinkles) But please note that doing microdermabrasion at home is safe only if done with gentle suction or crystal-free tips so best find a professional for this. Tips: Exfoliate skin 2 to 3 times a week, switching between glycolic and retinol on different nights. Don't forget to use SPF afterward since AHAs can make your skin more sensitive to the sun.

**Common Exfoliation Mistakes to Avoid**

* Don't exfoliate active breakouts; just use spot treatment for those, you can also use targeted anti-inflammatory ingredients for acne prone skin like benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, and sulfur.
* Avoid mixing exfoliants with retinoids unless your skin's used to it.
* Don't scrub too hard, as that can cause tiny tears in your skin.
* Don’t exfoliate skin after dermaplaning; wait at least 3 days.
* Don't mix niacinamide with DIY acids, since it can irritate your skin due to unregulated PH. Understand that Niacinamide can be layered with acids, but DIY acids like lemon juice or apple cider vinegar can be highly irritating and unstable.
* And don’t scrub breakouts; use a targeted treatment instead.
* Don't scrub your skin under running water. It can cause irritation.
* Don’t use rough scrubs when your skin is soaking wet, especially apricot shells or salt.
* Skip exfoliating if your skin is already red or irritated from sunburn, or razor burns.

**Final Tip: Pay Attention to Your Skin**

If it stings, hurts, turns red, or starts to peel, take it easy. You want exfoliation to give you a glow, not damage your skin. So try using exfoliating skincare less often or switch to something gentler.

**FAQs**

**Is it safe to scrub in the shower?**

Yes, just make sure of that: your skin's a bit wet, not dripping. The scrub you're using is a fine scrub that is oil based, like coffee mixed with coconut oil. And be gentle, so no rough scrubbing! Also avoid using the scrub for facial use in hot water shower, because this can dilate blood vessels and worsen redness.

**Can exfoliation cause breakouts?**

Yes, but only if you go overboard with your exfoliating routine, as that can cause redness and flaking, which means your skin barrier might be messed up. If you also use scrubs that can clog your pores, like ones with plastic beads which are banned in most countries. If you forget to put on a lightweight moisturizer afterwar exfoliation. So, make sure you don’t do any of these.

**What’s the best exfoliant for dark spots?**

Use Vitamin C in the morning to [brighten your skin.](https://makhzan.ae/products/antiaging-serum-for-fine-lines-and-wrinkles) At night, try Mandelic acid, which is a gentle acid that helps reduce dark spots. Niacinamide and azelaic acid also help reduce pigmentation without irritation. Just be careful not to exfoliate too much, as it can make hyperpigmentation worse.

**Can I exfoliate before and after shaving?**

Before Shaving: Absolutely! Please go ahead and exfoliate as  it helps stop ingrown hairs. Try using lactic acid or a gentle scrub.

After Shaving: No. Give it 24 to 48 hours before exfoliating your freshly shaved skin to avoid irritation.

Casting number 051103373, with KR or ABF cams. Yet to be confirmed.


After scouring my local machinists I found a company that performs loads of repairs to cracks.

Considering that VW techs would send these heads out with valve to plug cracks anyway, it gave me hope. Even though I have a valve to valve crack. 

I went to the machinist today and they had a look. No problem on the cracks and they went around their shop showing me the heads they were repairing and pictures of heads they had repaired.

What they were concerned about was the oil galley/channels on the camshaft beds. Cylinder one and two had channels but the rest did not.

Left the shop thinking I guess that's it, it's a sign, have to look for another head. Spent the afternoon searching online for images and videos of these heads and low and behold, every single one I found showed no galleys/channels in the tiny camshaft beds. The oil delivery hole is there! And the channels/galleys in the camshaft caps that hold down the camshafts exist and are in good condition.

So I wonder if there is anyone out there that has a 16v VW head from a Mk3 GTI or a b3 Passat that can confirm the status of the camshaft beds? I suppose I need to do a cross post in the VW subreddit. 

Got back in touch with the machinist with this information and he's happy to take the head and work on it.

So either from the factory, yes they have this tiny oil galley and it gets worn over time, considered normal or its not normal and I need to think about turning this into a coffee table.

This was largely due to starting to have tiredness\\brainfog and depressive like symptoms again at my previous dose, and is in line with my history of treatment, which has slowly required increasing every few years from my initial starting dose of 50mg.

The dosage increase hadn't had much impact, positive or negative, over the last 4 weeks (which I know is most likely due to the circulating T4 taking time to increase in my system), but the last 2 days, I've felt very ""wired"" and anxious, but also more alert and less brain foggy than previously. Essentially a bit like I've had a very strong cup of coffee that lasts most of the day.  I've never really had that with any dosage increase previously.   I've got a blood test scheduled in another 2 weeks (and an appointment with an endocrinologist the week after) but I wanted see what peoples thoughts were on this being a sign that the dosage is now too high and I've gone hyper, versus, my body just adjusting to the new dosage and I need to just tough it out for a while while my body adapts.  Generally speaking, my hypo symptoms have always been more mental than physical, so if it's just something I need to ride out I will, but it would be good to know how long this phase typically lasts before it settles down.  If it is a sign I've gone hyper, I assume it's better to continue at this dosage anyway until my bloodwork is done, so as not to invalidate the results?

1lecwu7,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_BobbyMcB99/comments/1lecwu7/galactic_goofballs_a_cosmic_confession_documentary/,Galactic Goofballs: A Cosmic Confession Documentary,"THE TRUE NATURE OF XPANGOR

Planet Xpangor is not a planet in the traditional sense. It is a semi-sentient imagination node—a living hub of chaotic thought at the neural intersection of the Andromeda galaxy’s subconscious. It was not created, but rather dreamed into existence by an ancient species known only as The Snozzlenauts, who have long since transcended the need for bodies, time, or meetings.

Xpangor's terrain morphs based on mood swings, cosmic rhythms, and whether you’ve eaten cheese recently. Its oceans taste different depending on your favorite color. It is, in Robert Gilmore’s own words, “a planet that runs on jazz logic and breakfast energy.”

🌘 THE MOONS: MOOZLE, GLOOB, ZAPPA

The three moons of Xpangor are believed to be the fragmented personalities of the same ancient cosmic entity: the Lunarchitect, a lunar trickster god who exploded from laughter during the first ever joke told in space (which involved a black hole and a poorly parked comet).

Moozle dreams for Xpangor. It is constantly asleep, emitting waves of drowsy energy that keep the planet from exploding from overthinking.

Gloob broods for Xpangor. It keeps all of the planet’s unresolved feelings in its gooey heart, which occasionally leaks sarcasm into the atmosphere.

Zappa parties for Xpangor. Its constant beat regulates time, tempo, and fashion sense across the surface.

The moons maintain the Psychogravitational Equilibrium of the planet. If one were to explode, time would turn inside out and everyone would forget how to high-five.

👑 WHO IS LORD WIZZALD?

Wizzald is not his real name. His real name was erased from galactic databases after he tried to trademark the word “evil.” According to the Galactic Conspiracy Codex (Vol. 9½), Lord Wizzald is the accidental reincarnation of a lost prophecy, born under the influence of all three moons during a disco nova.

He believes he was chosen to conquer the galaxy—but the prophecy actually said “confetti the galaxy,” which makes a lot more sense in hindsight. Wizzald’s powers fluctuate based on his confidence, wardrobe sequins per square inch, and how many people are watching.

He’s not evil. He’s just theatrically misunderstood.

🤖 GIZMO’S GLITCH ORIGIN

Gizmo was once a top-tier Galactic Peace Enforcer Unit, designed to resolve conflict through perfectly executed logic. Then it read Robert Gilmore’s Book of Cosmic Maybes and suffered an existential error cascade, permanently switching its primary operating mode to “Confused Entertainer.”

Now, Gizmo leaks quotes from philosophers who never existed and believes every object might be alive. It’s not entirely wrong.

👑 ZARA ZING & THE TRUTH SHE HIDES

Zara is more than just a princess. She is the last surviving heir of the Zing Dynasty, rulers of the now-vanished dimension of Linquazaar, which disappeared one Tuesday for reasons classified by twelve galactic governments. She keeps her past hidden behind sarcasm and well-aimed eye rolls. Her destiny is tied to the Gloobian Harmonics, a set of emotional frequencies encoded into the moon Gloob’s gravitational aura.

If she ever laughs and cries at the same time, it could open a portal to the Prime Joke, the original source of all comedy.

🎩 THE COSMIC COMEDY WAR

Long before the series begins, there was the Great Gag War between two rival factions:

The Chucklenauts, who believed laughter should liberate.

The Punquisition, who believed humor should be orderly and pun-based.

Their war lasted 999 tickle cycles. Xpangor was the armistice zone. But deep beneath the Disco Crater, some say the Punquisition still plots, preparing to return with their Anti-Giggle Blaster and serious ties.

⚠️ GILMORE’S GALACTIC WARNINGS

The moons are not stable. Gloob pulses more erratically each season.

Time on Xpangor may be folding into itself, explaining Captain Bloop’s ability to meet people before they’re born.

Zara’s pet jellyfish (never shown onscreen) might be a sleeper agent.

Lord Wizzald’s lair is built over a Wormhole of Regret, which echoes his failures back at him in musical form.

Every third joke told on Zappa becomes real. Use wisely.

🌀 THE PHILOSOPHY OF GOOFBALLS

At its core, Galactic Goofballs is not about chaos—it’s about finding meaning through nonsense, connection through failure, and truth through parody. It's what happens when you try to destroy the galaxy and accidentally throw it a birthday party instead.

Make it into a hour long documentary special

ChatGPT said:

Absolutely! Here's a treatment for a one-hour animated documentary special titled:

🎙️“GALACTIC GOOFBALLS: A COSMIC CONFESSION”

A Documentary Special by Robert Gilmore

FORMAT:

Length: 60 minutes

Style: Animated mockumentary, blending psychedelic visuals, unreliable interviews, surreal infographics, archival “footage,” and direct-to-camera monologues.

Tone: Think Cosmos meets This Is Spinal Tap meets Rick and Morty, directed by a paranoid but peaceful mystic who might be right about everything.

Narrator: Robert Gilmore himself, animated as a glowing, twitchy space-philosopher with constantly shifting outfits and a suspiciously blinking third eye.

STRUCTURE:

INTRO (0:00–5:00)

Visuals of cosmic spirals, ancient glyphs, and swirling starfields.

ROBERT GILMORE (V.O.):

""They laughed when I said the moons were sentient. They laughed harder when I said one of them told me a knock-knock joke. But who's laughing now? …Still them. But that's okay.""

We’re introduced to Xpangor—planet of paradoxes—and its three moons: Moozle, Gloob, and Zappa.

A “serious” animated documentary style is immediately broken by glitchy fonts, glitter explosions, and a musical number sung by the moons.

CHAPTER 1: ORIGINS OF THE COSMIC CHAOS (5:00–15:00)

The true origin of Xpangor: a living thought-form birthed by the forgotten race of Snozzlenauts.

Interview with a historian who is literally a cloud of bees in a hat.

The moons’ creation myth: Zappa bursts from a cosmic dance contest, Gloob from a dream argument, and Moozle just sort of happened after a really good nap.

Highlights:

A claymation reenactment of the “First Joke Ever Told in Space.”

Allegedly real footage of Moozle sleep-muttering the secrets of the multiverse.

CHAPTER 2: WHO IS LORD WIZZALD? (15:00–25:00)

Wizzald’s backstory, delivered like a behind-the-music segment.

Childhood flashbacks of Wizzald trying to rule his toy chest, narrated by an unreliable Gizmo log file.

His discovery of “the Prophecy of the Glitter King” (probably a cereal box promotion).

ROBERT GILMORE (direct to camera):

""He’s not a villain. He’s a symptom. A glitter-cloaked symptom of a cosmic overreaction.""

Commentary from Zara Zing (“He’s got the fashion sense of a god, and the emotional range of a soggy waffle.”)

CHAPTER 3: THE MOON PLOT (25:00–40:00)

The pilot episode’s premise expanded into mythic terms: Wizzald’s obsessive campaign to destroy one of the moons.

Charts and graphs that loop endlessly or contradict themselves.

Theories that destroying the moons would unlock:

A wormhole to infinite stand-up comedy.

A forgotten dimension made entirely of clowns.

A cosmic coffee shop where time stands still.

Animated recreation: Wizzald’s failed attempts to explode Moozle via tap-dance vibrations and hot sauce.

CHAPTER 4: THE CREW (40:00–50:00)

Zara Zing: Her secret Linquazaar past, delivered through noir-style flashbacks and glowing space calligraphy.

Captain Bloop: A “gadget archaeologist” with no formal training and a sentient fanny pack.

Gizmo: Diagnosed as ""technologically haunted.""

ROBERT GILMORE (V.O.):

""They’re not heroes. They’re not villains. They’re… well, mostly confused. But confusion, my friends, is the doorway to enlightenment.""

CHAPTER 5: THE REAL TRUTH (50:00–60:00)

Robert Gilmore goes full whiteboard-conspiracy-mode.

A cosmic map made entirely of spaghetti diagrams, showing how everything in the galaxy is connected by jokes.

Suggestion that the galaxy itself is a sitcom being filmed for a higher-dimensional audience.

Final message from Moozle, delivered telepathically through a puddle:

“Don’t destroy the moons. Tell better jokes.”

Manual link building is obsolete. Discover how to leverage the power of artificial intelligence to build high-quality backlinks, crush your competitors, and automate your SEO strategy for explosive growth.

No credit card required. Start ranking faster today.

# Why Manual Link Building is a Losing Battle

For decades, link building has been the cornerstone of any successful SEO strategy. A robust backlink profile is arguably the most critical ranking factor in Google's algorithm. Yet, the traditional methods of acquiring these invaluable links are fundamentally broken. They are a relic of a bygone digital era, struggling to keep pace with the demands of the modern web.

If you've ever managed a link-building campaign, you know the pain. It's a grueling, resource-intensive process characterized by endless spreadsheets, low response rates, and frustratingly slow progress. The high cost of link building isn't just financial; it's a massive drain on time, creativity, and morale. Let's break down the core issues plaguing manual link building:

# The Time Sink to End All Time Sinks

Consider the typical workflow for acquiring a single, high-quality backlink:

* **Prospecting (10-20 hours):** Manually sifting through search results, competitor backlink profiles, and blog rolls to find potentially relevant websites. This involves endless searches for keywords like ""write for us + \[your niche\]"", checking domain authority (DA) or domain rating (DR), and trying to find contact information.
* **Vetting (5-10 hours):** Once you have a list, you must manually vet each site. Is it legitimate? Does it have real traffic? Is it a dreaded link farm? This requires using multiple SEO analysis tools and a keen eye for quality.
* **Content Creation (5-15 hours):** Crafting a high-value guest post, a piece of linkable content, or a resource that is worthy of a link. This isn't just writing; it's research, editing, and formatting.
* **Outreach (5-10 hours):** Personalizing and sending hundreds of emails, knowing full well that a 95% failure rate is considered ""good."" You're battling spam filters and inundated editors.
* **Follow-up (2-5 hours):** Systematically following up without being annoying, tracking responses, and negotiating placement.

This Herculean effort, often spanning 20-50 hours, might yield just *one* quality backlink. Scaling this process is a nightmare. To build 20 links a month, you'd need a dedicated team working full-time, making it an unsustainable SEO model for most businesses.

# Prohibitively Expensive and Unscalable

The time cost directly translates to financial cost. Whether you're paying an in-house team or a link building agency, the price tag is steep. Agencies often charge $300-$1000+ per link. A modest campaign can easily run into tens of thousands of dollars per year with no guaranteed ROI. This high cost of link building creates a barrier to entry, leaving small and medium-sized businesses unable to compete with enterprises with deeper pockets. The entire model is inherently unscalable, limiting your growth potential.

>""We were spending over $10,000 a month on manual outreach with an agency and seeing minimal results. The process was a black box, and the link velocity was glacial. We knew there had to be a better way.""

This is the reality for countless companies. The manual approach is a bottleneck, a slow, expensive grind that yields diminishing returns in an increasingly competitive digital landscape. It's time for a paradigm shift.

# Enter the Game-Changer: What Exactly is AI Link Building?

Imagine having a team of thousands of expert SEOs working for you 24/7, identifying perfect link opportunities, crafting personalized outreach, and analyzing results in real-time. That's the power of **AI link building**. It's not just about doing the old things faster; it's about a fundamentally smarter, more effective approach to search engine optimization.

AI link building leverages artificial intelligence, machine learning (ML), and natural language processing (NLP) to automate and optimize every single step of the backlink acquisition process. It transforms the manual grind into a streamlined, data-driven, and highly scalable operation. Think of it as replacing a paper map and a compass with a real-time, satellite-guided GPS. Both can get you to your destination, but one is infinitely faster, more efficient, and more reliable.

# How AI Transforms Each Step:

* **Prospecting on Steroids:** Instead of manual searches, AI algorithms analyze millions of data points in seconds. They scan the web to find topically relevant sites, assess their authority and traffic metrics, and even identify the most likely contact person, all with inhuman speed and accuracy. This is the core of effective link building automation.
* **Data-Driven Vetting:** AI-powered backlink building software doesn't just look at DA. It analyzes hundreds of signals—organic traffic trends, keyword profiles, backlink velocity, social signals, and potential toxicity—to provide a holistic quality score, ensuring you only target valuable opportunities and avoid link building penalties.
* **Hyper-Personalized Outreach at Scale:** Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the magic ingredient here. AI can analyze a target website's content, tone, and recent articles to craft highly personalized outreach emails that resonate with editors. It can reference specific articles, suggest relevant guest post topics, and tailor the value proposition, achieving response rates that manual efforts can only dream of.
* **Intelligent Content Generation:** Modern AI can assist in creating high-quality, relevant content for guest posts or linkable assets. By providing a target keyword and outline, AI content creation tools can generate drafts that are well-researched and contextually appropriate, slashing content production time by over 80%.

This isn't science fiction. This is the new standard for competitive SEO in 2025 and beyond. By embracing an AI-powered SEO strategy, you're not just saving time and money; you're gaining a significant competitive advantage, allowing you to build a powerful backlink profile faster and more effectively than ever before.

# Choosing the Best Backlink Software for 2025: Why AI Monstertools Dominates

The market is flooding with so-called ""AI SEO tools,"" but most are little more than simple scrapers with a fancy dashboard. True **AI link building** requires a sophisticated, integrated platform built from the ground up on powerful machine learning models. This is where AI Monstertools stands in a class of its own.

AI Monstertools isn't just a tool; it's a complete link building ecosystem. We've engineered the most advanced—and arguably the **best backlink software for 2025**—by focusing on what truly matters: delivering scalable, high-quality results safely and efficiently. We didn't just automate the old process; we reinvented it.

# The Four Pillars of AI Monstertools' Success:

# 1. The 'Relevance & Authority' Engine

Our proprietary AI engine goes beyond basic metrics. It uses contextual analysis to understand the \*true\* relevance of a potential link partner to your niche. It analyzes semantic keyword overlap, audience intent, and content structure to find opportunities your competitors will never see with their traditional tools. It then cross-references this with over 50 authority signals—from classic DA/PA and traffic metrics to advanced indicators like backlink growth trends and brand mention velocity—to ensure every prospect is a high-value target.

# 2. 'Hyper-Personalization AI' for Outreach

This is our secret sauce. Our Natural Language Generation (NLG) models don't use generic templates. They read and understand the target website. The AI identifies the editor's name, analyzes the tone of their articles, references recent posts, and crafts a unique, compelling outreach email for every single prospect. It can suggest three hyper-relevant guest post titles based on the site's content gaps, making the ""yes"" an easy decision for any editor. This is the key to breaking through the noise and achieving industry-leading response rates.

# 3. The 'Link Guard' Safety System

Aggressive link building can be risky. That's why we built Link Guard. Our AI constantly monitors your backlink profile, automatically identifying and flagging potentially toxic or low-quality links. It analyzes link neighborhoods, flags any connection to known PBNs (Private Blog Networks), and monitors for negative SEO signals. This proactive defense system ensures your link building efforts always help, never harm, your rankings, keeping you safe from Google penalties.

# 4. 'Opportunity Flow' Dashboard

We've eliminated spreadsheets forever. Our intuitive dashboard provides a seamless workflow. The AI surfaces the best opportunities, you approve them with a click. The AI crafts and sends the personalized outreach, you track opens, replies, and secured links in real-time. It's a fully transparent, end-to-end link building automation system that gives you complete control without the manual labor. You can manage a campaign that would normally require five full-time employees in just a few hours a week.

# You Have Two Paths to SEO Dominance

Whether you want to drive the campaign yourself or have our experts manage it for you, AI Monstertools has the perfect solution.

# The Ultimate DIY Tool

Take control with the most powerful AI link building software on the market. Perfect for agencies and in-house SEOs.

# Done-For-You Service

Let our team of AI-powered experts build high-quality links for you. The ultimate hands-off solution for growth.

# Step-by-Step: Launching Your First AI Link Building Campaign

The power of AI Monstertools lies in its sophisticated simplicity. We've distilled the complexities of enterprise-level link building into a straightforward process that anyone can master in minutes. Here’s how you can launch a powerful campaign and start building authoritative backlinks today.

1. **Step 1: Set Up Your Project (2 Minutes)**Simply enter your website URL and your top 1-3 target keywords. This is the only ""work"" you need to do. Our AI immediately gets to work, analyzing your current site, your content, your existing backlink profile, and your top competitors to establish a baseline and understand your niche.
2. **Step 2: AI Prospecting & Analysis (Happens in the background)**While you grab a coffee, our 'Relevance & Authority' Engine scans millions of domains. It’s not just scraping; it's performing a deep semantic analysis to find the most powerful and relevant link opportunities. It filters out spam, PBNs, and low-quality sites, presenting you with a pre-vetted list of prime targets in your Opportunity Flow dashboard, complete with authority metrics and a ""Link Quality Score.""
3. **Step 3: Approve Your Targets (5 Minutes)**Review the list of high-quality prospects our AI has discovered. You have full control. Simply click ""Approve"" on the sites you like, or ""Reject"" any that aren't a perfect fit. This human-in-the-loop step ensures the AI learns your preferences, becoming even smarter and more accurate for your future campaigns. You can approve hundreds of prospects in the time it would take to manually vet one.
4. **Step 4: Launch the AI Outreach Campaign (1 Click)**Once you've approved your targets, click ""Launch Campaign."" That's it. Our 'Hyper-Personalization AI' takes over. It crafts unique, context-aware emails for each approved prospect and begins the outreach sequence, including intelligent, non-spammy follow-ups. You don't write a single email.
5. **Step 5: Monitor & Watch Your Rankings Climb**Your dashboard comes alive with real-time data. Track email open rates, reply rates, and most importantly, newly acquired backlinks. Our system automatically verifies when a link goes live and reports it to you. You can see your link velocity, track your domain authority growth, and watch as your investment translates directly into higher search engine rankings and increased organic traffic.

This is the future of link building: a powerful, scalable, and transparent process that delivers results, not spreadsheets.

# Frequently Asked Questions About AI Link Building











# The Future is Automated. Don't Get Left Behind.

The gap between those who use AI and those who don't is widening every day. Continuing with manual link building in 2025 is like trying to win a Formula 1 race on a bicycle. The choice is clear: embrace the power, scale, and intelligence of AI link building or become an irrelevant footnote in the search results.

I got the mat setup on the coffee table and put my feet up watching a movie. About a couple minutes in my feet started tingling up to my knees. It's a sensation that's hard to describe. It feels like a very slight electrical exchange taking place (it's not like getting electrocuted but it's in a similar vein when you describe it. No pain, no discomfort). Sometimes I readjust my legs a little when the sensation randomly spikes because it's very aparent. 

30 minutes in I felt a very noticable improvement in calmness, happiness, and focus. It's been 2 hours now and I'm still tingling away feeling much better than I did before I put my legs on it. It feels my brain had gotten tiny extra stimulation/power source 😂. 

My sister has never heard of grounding and she also confirmed the tingling and improved mood while grounding with me. 

What's interesting is the mat is much more powerful than grounding in grass. When I ground in the grass I feel some benefits and improvements in how I feel. However it's not this strong. In the grass some of the improvement I feel may actually be from the sun helping too, since the sun does also improve my mood. 

I was a little skeptical at first. I was concerned I wasted my money. I don't feel that way anymore. I'm excited to see how I will be feeling by the end of year as I ground and work on my overall health. 

(I got my mat from Earth and Moons. They have a kit with 2 large mats for about $110. Includes a outlet tester which I used to verify the ground. I also do an anti inflammatory diet which I think is crucial to grounding). ",3,1750238126.0,Earthing,0,1.0,False

**Title: ""Dispatches from Brockton""**  
*Based on true events, bent through a funhouse mirror of raw memory and bitter humor.*

It’s another Friday night in Brockton, Massachusetts—where the streetlights flicker like old neon promises and sirens are part of the ambient soundtrack. In a modest two-story home wrapped in peeling paint and family ghosts, **Bobby Gilmore** leans back in his chair, one foot resting on the busted coffee table, the other itching from a gout flare-up. The air is thick with cigarette smoke and leftover tension from arguments that never fully ended.

**Enter: The Old Man.**

That’s what Bobby calls him. **The Father. The Firestarter. The Flashpoint.**  
A retired Vietnam vet with a temper like a matchbook and a liver soaked in whiskey. Every week without fail, like it’s church or bingo night, he drinks himself into a patriotic rage, flips through cable news, mutters about ""the damn government,"" and—cue the ritual—**calls 911.**

>

**Cut to: The Brockton Police Department.**  
Officers roll their eyes when the address comes over the scanner.  
""Aw hell, it’s the Gilmores again. Pack the cuffs and the aspirin.""

And every time they roll up, Bobby’s standing there like a bad sitcom punchline—sober-ish, shirtless, beer in hand, no clue what the hell’s happening this time.

""**Assault & Battery, sir.** Your father claims you went full Mortal Kombat.""

""Bro, I was heating up Chef Boyardee and listening to Metallica. How’d I land in a boss fight with my pops?!""

Doesn’t matter. The old man’s got scratches—self-inflicted or from tripping over the cat—and Bobby’s got a record. That’s all it takes.

**Jail. Again.**

Bobby sits in holding, thinking about all the times he tried to keep the peace, to de-escalate. Tried to be the grown-up. He thinks about how trauma doesn’t just echo—it *clings*. He remembers his grandfather Joe, the old-school Italian firefighter who hated cops but loved honor. Joe would’ve never called the fuzz over a family fight. Joe would've grabbed a beer, cursed everyone out, and told Bobby to quit being a drama queen—then hugged him anyway.

**But Joe’s dead.**

Now it’s Bobby and a drunk old man with a smartphone, and a legal system that sees a 50-year-old white guy with a sketchy past and assumes, *yeah, he probably snapped*.

**Flash-forward:**

Bobby’s out. Charges dropped. No bruises. Just another notch in the surreal carnival that is life in Brockton. The house is quiet now. Dad passed out. Cigarettes still burn in the ashtray like forgotten prayers.

And Bobby? He’s not angry.

He’s *tired*.

But there’s a flicker in him, still. A tiny glow. Maybe it’s hope. Maybe it’s just gas.

He grabs a pen and starts scribbling. Not a confession. Not a rant.

A story.

Because if life’s gonna treat him like a punchline, he might as well write the damn joke himself.

**Epilogue:**  
The phone rings. Bobby doesn’t answer.  
The voicemail plays out.

>

Fade to black.  
Cue Metallica.  
Roll credits.

At the start of each shift I brew Cafe Bustelo coffee to stay alert. About two weeks ago a resident poured themselves a cup while I was assisting another resident. He fell asleep and stayed in bed for the remainder of the evening. Last night two residents had an arguement and to get them seperated I offered one a cup of coffee. He drank it and quickly slept for the entire night. Both situtations are entirely anedoctal, but I'd like to note both residents tend to be awake throughout the night during my shifts.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Witty & Tongue-in-Cheek Analysis: Falkenbergs FF vs. Sandvikens IF**  
Ah, the Superettan! Where the drama is as thick as the Swedish winters and the goals are as rare as a clean sheet in a snowstorm. This clash between Falkenbergs FF and Sandvikens IF is a classic ""pick your poison"" affair—two teams with roughly equal chances of winning, a draw that’s practically a third team, and odds that scream, “Bet on the underdog, but don’t expect them to win.” Let’s break it down with the precision of a Swede’s coffee schedule.

---

### The Numbers Game

**Odds Breakdown** (June 18, 2025):

* **Falkenbergs FF**: 2.65–2.75 (implied probability: \~38–37%)
* **Sandvikens IF**: 2.29–2.45 (implied probability: \~43–44%)
* **Draw**: 3.4–3.85 (implied probability: \~26–28%)

**Underdog Win Rate Context**:

* Soccer underdogs win **41%** of the time. Sandvikens’ implied 43–44% is *just* above this benchmark. Falkenbergs’ 37–38% is slightly below their expected win rate for favorites (typically \~55–60% in tight matches).

**Key Takeaway**: The bookmakers are pricing this like a coin flip with a side of caffeine. Falkenbergs is the faintest of favorites, but Sandvikens is *almost* a value underdog. The draw? Overpriced.

---

### Injury & Player Updates

No major injuries or suspensions reported for either team. Both squads are presumably at full strength, which is a relief for bettors who hate surprises.

---

### Data-Driven Best Bet

**1. Falkenbergs FF to Win**

* **Why?** Their implied probability (37–38%) is **below** the expected win rate for a favorite in a low-scoring league like the Superettan (\~50%). The gap (\~12–13%) gives this pick a **positive Expected Value (EV)**.
* **EV Calculation**:
   * Implied probability: 37%
   * Expected probability (as a favorite): \~50%
   * EV = (0.50 \* 2.65) - (0.50 \* 1) = **+0.325** (per $1 bet).

**2. Under 2.5 Goals**

* **Why?** Superettan matches often end with 1–2 goals, and the user’s tip notes Allsvenskan (Sweden’s top league) is similarly tight. Falkenbergs and Sandvikens are mid-table teams with defensive tendencies.
* **Odds**: Under 2.5 goals @ 2.20 (Bovada) implies a 45% chance. Historical data suggests this is **undervalued** (\~55–60% actual probability).

---

### Split the Difference & Expected Value

* **Falkenbergs FF**:
   * Implied probability: 37%
   * Adjusted for underdog rate: 37% + (41% - 37%) = **41%**
   * **EV**: Positive if actual win rate > 37%.
* **Sandvikens IF**:
   * Implied probability: 43%
   * Underdog rate: 41%
   * **EV**: Slightly negative (43% > 41%).

---

### Final Verdict

**Best Bet**: **Falkenbergs FF to Win** @ 2.65 (Bovada)  
**Secondary Bet**: **Under 2.5 Goals** @ 2.20 (Bovada)

**Why?** Falkenbergs’ slight edge in form and the overpriced draw make them the safest pick. The under 2.5 goals market is a no-brainer for those who’ve mastered the art of “defensive football” (i.e., not scoring).

**Sarcastic Bonus Tip**: If you’re feeling spicy, back the draw. Just don’t expect it to happen. It’s like betting on a snowstorm in July—possible, but you’ll need a better umbrella.

We met around my birthday, and from day one, our connection has been emotional and consistent. He’s kind, emotionally intelligent, makes me feel safe, and brings a lot of peace into my life. We talk every day, and I feel genuinely seen by him.

We recently went on a date — breakfast in the car, games at a coffee shop, and he even gave me thoughtful gifts (a journal pen, chocolates, a ring). Everything about him feels like what I’ve always wanted in a person.

But… I’m not physically attracted to him. He’s very skinny, slightly shorter than me (or at least the same height), and just not the body type I usually feel drawn to. That throws me off sometimes — especially when he’s romantic or flirty — and I feel incredibly guilty because I care about him as a person so much. There’s just no physical spark right now, and I find myself overthinking whether it’ll ever come.

He’s even said he’s willing to wait and stay friends until I figure things out, but I don’t know if that’s fair to him. At the same time, part of me doesn’t want to let go — I keep wondering, what if attraction grows later? What if I regret walking away from someone who’s everything I need emotionally?

So my question is:

How do you make a decision when your emotional and intellectual connection with someone is strong, but physical attraction is missing? Can attraction grow later — or is it more respectful to let go now before it becomes more painful for both people?

Would love to hear from anyone who’s navigated something similar — especially if you’ve either stayed and grown to feel attraction, or walked away and how that played out.

Thanks in advance.

**AITA for not letting my coworker borrow my charger even though her phone was dying?**



Okay, so this might sound petty, but I swear this has been building up for a while.

I (25F) work in an office with mostly cool people, but there’s one girl. Let’s call her Lisa, who constantly ""borrows"" things and never gives them back unless you ask. And even when you ask, it’s with that sigh like you’re bothering her for wanting your own stuff.

Anyway, last week, I brought in my phone charger the long, good one, not the gas station kind because I forgot to charge overnight. Around 2PM, Lisa strolls over and goes, “Heyyy, is your charger free? Mine’s at home and I need to make a call later.”

Now, normally I’d say yes, but literally just two weeks ago she borrowed my charger and kept it for three days. I had to go charger-less at work and then finally walked over and asked for it back. She acted like I was being dramatic.

So this time I said, “Actually, I kinda need it to keep my phone alive today.”

She got annoyed and said I was being selfish and that her phone was at 9%. I said, “Mine was at 7% twenty minutes ago, that’s why I brought my charger.” She gave me this look like I’d just kicked a puppy, rolled her eyes, and walked away.

Now a couple of coworkers are saying it wouldn’t have hurt me to let her use it “for just a bit,” but I’m kind of tired of being the backup power bank for someone who doesn’t return things unless she’s hunted down like a side quest.

AITA for saying no?

TL;DR: Coworker wanted to borrow my charger. I said no because she always keeps stuff too long. She got mad. Was I being petty?

**extapolapoketl**

*You’re being petty but I love it. She’s being entitled and spoiled. One of your coworkers can lend her theirs if they want to!!*

>OOP: Haha thank you!! Honestly I felt a tiny bit petty in the moment but also weirdly proud. Like, I’ve officially retired from being the office “community charger.” If the others think it's “just a bit,” then yeah. They can absolutely be the heroes next time.

**pigandpom**

*Surely she has someone else's charger stuffed in her desk somewhere. NTA. Her lack of preparedness is not your problem.*

**mumtaz2004**

*You’ll note that none of your coworkers jumped up to loan Lisa THEIR charger! Funny how that is. You’re supposed to give her your stuff but they would never share theirs… Don’t give anyone, anything going forward. Just establish a “no loaning” policy, because you’ve learned the hard way that you don’t always get things returned. Done. End of discussion. Lisa’s an AH and a big girl. She could have tried multiple other options-her world will not come to a screeching halt bc you did not loan her your charger. It’s a phone charger, not an epipen while she’s experiencing anaphylaxis. NTA.*



**\*\*Judgement - NTA\*\***



**Update - 2 days later**



Hey y’all! Just wanted to say thanks for all the comments. I didn’t expect this to get much attention but wow, apparently we’ve all got a “Lisa” in our lives.

So… here’s the mini soap opera that unfolded:

The day after the whole charger incident, Lisa came in acting super cold. Like, ""barely-a-nod-in-the-break-room"" cold. I let it go because I honestly didn’t feel like dying on the hill of “why are you being weird about my phone cable.”

Anyway, later that afternoon she made a very loud point of saying to no one in particular, “Some people just can’t share, I guess,” while pulling out one of those ancient brick backup chargers that charges your phone from 7% to 8% in an hour. I just sipped my coffee and pretended to be deep in an email to ""Corporate"" (aka scrolling memes).

But here's the best part: My manager actually pulled her aside, not me...and gently reminded her that personal items should be respected and that she should stop treating people’s desks like a rental shelf. I didn’t snitch, I swear. I think someone else must’ve overheard her salty commentary and reported it.

Also, fun twist: Turns out Lisa borrowed another girl’s stapler a while back and it “mysteriously” ended up in her drawer. So… looks like I’m not the only one with a Lisa Loan Crisis.

Moral of the story? Protect your chargers, your staplers, and your sanity.

Anyway, thanks for backing me up. Feels good to know I wasn’t being petty, just setting a boundary that should’ve been obvious.

Let me know if Lisa tries to borrow oxygen next.

1lec2r7,https://i.redd.it/7x5c6guyen7f1.jpeg,Public profile for a new born baby,"Just happened to scroll the “ a.c.h.u_5” from “micset team” reels - It’s genuinely horrifying and not in a quirky, overreacting way, but in a deeply unsettling to witness new parents creating Instagram profiles for their newborns. Actual babies. With usernames. And bios. And a stream of carefully curated posts tracking everything from their first bath to the exact moment their first tooth breaks the surface. Publicly. For everyone to see. As if the internet is some cozy living room filled with only well-wishing aunties and uncles, rather than a chaotic, unpredictable space where your baby’s photos can be saved, copied, misused, or twisted by literally anyone. Do you really need strangers scrolling through your child’s life like it’s a morning coffee routine?

What makes it more terrifying is the normalization of it. It’s not just one or two people doing this—it’s a growing wave. Parents acting like their babies are influencers before they can even crawl, letting followers into every vulnerable, personal moment of their child’s early years. No privacy. No consent. Just digital footprints stamped from Day 1, or in some cases, even before birth—like the ultrasound becomes the first profile picture. How do people not stop to think: “Should I really be doing this?” Instead, the urge to document and share everything online seems to overpower basic parental instinct to protect.

This isn’t about shaming parents for being proud or excited. That’s natural. But it becomes deeply disturbing when the desire to flex a perfect parenthood image overshadows a child’s future right to their own identity, autonomy, and digital privacy. Because one day, that baby will grow up and realize that their entire childhood—milestones, messy faces, vulnerable hospital visits, maybe even tantrums—was put online without their permission. For what? Likes? Clout? Validation?

There’s a line, and this crosses it in the most unsettling way. Children deserve to grow up without being unknowingly turned into content. They deserve protection. And parents—you—should be the ones fiercely guarding that, not handing it away for the algorithm.",5,1750236254.0,TamilInfluencer,0,1.0,False

I'm almost three weeks off cigarettes, and I have some questions I was hoping some of you could answer through your own experiences. I smoked for 12 years, and the last 3 years have been at least a pack a day. I was so ironclad in my mind about wanting to quit this time, that the withdrawals didn't seem to affect me. I'd get cravings, and push them aside. The seventh day after quitting was the worst for cravings, and I pushed through. I keep expecting 'smokers flu' to catch up, because I was a heavy chainsmoker, and would constantly need to clear my throat, or having coughing fits at night when I was asleep, and so I imagine there's a lot of crud my lungs need to clear out. But so far, so good. 

But then today I woke up with a super metallic taste in my mouth, made my morning coffee taste weird, makes soda and water taste weird, and when cooking dinner with my partner - Hello Fresh cheeseburgers - the smell of the onions and the balsamic vinegar hit me like a train, in a bad way. And the burger also tasted strange. I've read online this can be a side effect to the quitting-smoking-journey, as the blood vessels and such in your mouth begin to reoxygenate. 

I guess my question is, anyone else here experience this? And if so, how long did it last? I gotta say, out of all the symptoms of quitting so far, I hate this one the most. Brushing my teeth hasn't helped. 

It also is very much like symptoms I had when I had covid - effected taste and smell - so part of me is like, do I just have Covid again? 😅

* Koinly choked on NFT mints, doubled my bridge cost basis, and showed a phantom $9 k gain.
* Switched to ZenLedger, mapped a custom CSV, bulk-classified gas, and balanced the whole thing to within $12 of my manual sheet, all before coffee got cold.

**Why Koinly tapped out**

1. **NFT spam** – every $0 mint labeled “withdrawal.” Fifty clicks later I still had missing cost basis errors.
2. **Bridges** – Base in/out registered as buys *and* deposits → inflated gains.
3. **Solana DEX fees** – tiny lamport fees ignored, so net PnL was off by \~4 %.
4. CSV export + manual fix took me six hours, and I wasn’t even halfway done. Rage quit.

**What ZenLedger did differently (surprisingly)**

|ZenLedger feature|Why it actually mattered|
|:-|:-|
|**Custom CSV template**|Mapped “gas\_fee”, “token\_spent”, “token\_received” - fixed Solana & ETH gas in one upload.|
|**Bulk gas classifier**|Turns 12 k micro-fees into one deductible line.|
|**Live chat that…chats**|Support jumped into a Loom call, pointed out my cost-basis mis-mapping, and handed me the coupon below.|
|**Form 8949 preview watermark**|Slightly annoying, but at least I knew totals before paying.|

Drawbacks: UI is slower than Koinly with huge datasets; Unlimited tier is $$$ if you’re airdrop-degen. Worth it for my sanity, though.

**My 5-step cleanup playbook**

1. Export raw chain CSVs (Etherscan, Solscan, Basescan).
2. Upload with ZenLedger’s DeFi CSV template, map fee & gas columns.
3. Run **Bulk → Classify Gas** (instantly collapses micro-fees).
4. Ignore unrevealed NFTs & failed txs via Multi-Select → “Ignore.”
5. Generate 8949, cross-check wallet balances, exhale.

Total hands-on time: \~90 min.

**Open questions for the pros here**

* Anyone found a cleaner way to handle L2 bridge cost basis without CSV hacks?
* Are you treating validator rewards as income on receipt or deferring until disposal?
* Is there *any* tool that auto-imports Solana memo fees correctly besides manual CSV?",21,1750235658.0,CryptoTax,5,0.93,False

I tried MiraLAX, prunes, juices, stool softeners, laxatives, I even started drinking lots of coffee to see if it will help. I keep walking around hoping that will get something moving in me.
There’s moments when I feel like I gotta like if I’m going to have diarrhea but when I go to the bathroom I get NOTHING! 
last time I went m, I thought I pooped but when I looked to see if finally I passed something there was a smaller pebble, I was like WTF!!

1lebvb9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hot_Romance_Stories/comments/1lebvb9/no_title/,No title,"It all started on a warm evening in July. I was running away from my family, friends, and maybe even myself. I ended up at a bar across town. I was in my early 20s so it was highly possible for me to make an insane decision in my environment. I sat at the nearest stool I could find. I was there for a good 5 minutes whenever he appeared. A lean guy with jet black hair sat next to me. He had glasses, and a charming smile. He probably noticed me studying him. He gave me a sharp side-eye causing me to look away. I didn’t want him to think I was some weird jackass. I ordered another beer, and looked at my reflection in the glass bottle. I remember thinking of all the mistakes I made. I must’ve been looking pretty sad cause all of a sudden I feel a nudge on my shoulder. His voice was deep, but flowed like a feather into my ears somehow. Like a smooth melody. “You good”? He asked giving me a smile as I looked up at him. I’m not the type of guy to really “vent” or “share my feelings”. With others as I find it corny. So I just shook my head, and gave a thumbs up trying to act cool. He gave a slight frown and said “look buddy I hope you don’t try to lie to the police like that one day” he said eyeing the third beer bottle. I sighed and just muttered “just life you know”. “Ah I see so life’s kicking your ass as well huh”? I laughed as I started to feel a bit comfortable knowing I wasn’t the only one struggling. We started talking about random shit after that. Three to four bottles later and we’re stumbling out of the bar and into an elevator. Out of the two of us I was less drunk as I’ve had my share of alcohol throughout high school. But he was flat out drunk to the point where he was crying. Out of everyone I’m glad I was the one to get him home in this state. I managed to find his apartment and unlock the door. It was a great spaced place with lots of room. I laid him on his bed and went for the door. When all of a sudden I feel something tug at my hand. He was crying for me to stay. This was a really risky decision as I didn’t wanna wake up in the morning in this guys house and him have completely no memory of the previous evening. I tried to reassure him, but ended up having to crash on the couch due to him starting to cry. I woke up the next morning to him standing over me grinning. I remember thinking “what the hell”? “Good morning buddy rise and shine” he said handing me a cup of orange juice. Did this dude not have a hangover? I took it and chugged it down. It wasn’t until I got to the last sip whenever the headache hit. I remember yelling “FUCK”. He then laughed, and handed me a bottle of Tylenol. This probably wasn’t this guys first rodeo of doing this. He was so well prepared. “Sorry” I said taking the bottle and pouring out 2 pills. “I’ll be out of your hair” I got up and headed for the door. “Wait” I heard as I got closer to the door. I turned around to see him looking right at me. “Last night whenever we were talking you were saying something about having no place to go” he said. I really gotta stop getting drunk I thought looking ashamed. “Well yeah I mean my life is kinda shit right now” I said. “Well….i got an extra room here, and uh wouldn’t mind a roommate” he said pointing to the back. “Dude you literally just met me last night at a bar” I said looking concerned. “I think your trust levels are up a little too low” I said going back for the door. “Well the offer is here if you need it” he said. I left and as soon as I got to the elevator I thought about my options. I actually had no where to go. My family kicked me out due to my sister “needing more space” and my friends didn’t have room. I remember thinking “fuck it” and I went back up and knocked on the door. He answered and laughed like he wasn’t surprised. “Well I guess you had second thoughts”? He said opening up the door so that I could come in. After a few days of moving out of my parents house and into a well spaced room. I was finally done. He knocked on my door the night I finally got settled and suggested that we celebrate. We went out to the same bar then to a library then to the town square. I remember laughing and getting to know the guy better. Whenever we finally got back home we were both laughing and a little drunk. I sat at the table as he walked in the bathroom. I sighed and thought it was about time for me to get some sleep. I got up and started walking towards my room when all of a sudden I bumped into him. I kinda bumped into the wall. As we both apologized. I interlocked eyes with him somehow. It was like a deep connection. This time I got a good look at him. The moment was deep. Then he inched closer towards me. I remember thinking what the fuck is going on. But it all came to a stop whenever he got so close that we could basically touch noses. I don’t know if it was because I was drunk or something else. But I went for it. I shoved my lips towards his. Then pulled back. His face shifted. The regret hit me like a blade. I immediately went to my room and sat on the bed thinking about what I’d just done. This guy was definitely gonna kick me out let alone kick my ass. After about twenty minutes in deep thoughts I heard my door open slowly. He stood there with an expression that was hard to read. “I…I’m sorry if I made you uncomfortable” I sputtered looking at the floor with shame. I felt like something deep down within was shifting in me. He then sat beside me and said “you’re all good” he said smiling at me. He then inched closer towards me and patted me on the back. We interlocked eyes again. But this time was different. This time he kissed me more and more. It went from kissing to stripping. From stripping to touching. I remember thinking what the fuck was I doing as I was scared at the thought of doing it with a guy. Trying to get rid of the thoughts I ended up on top with him and without a second thought I put it in. I remember the euphoria of that moment. I felt warm I felt relaxed. I gripped the bed frame and started going to work. He bit his lip and gripped the cover in pleasure. I remember the bed shaking and the sound of utter most pleasure. It wasn’t long before I ended up finishing and passing out. I woke up the next Morning and immediately thought it was some sort of dream. I was relaxed as he wasn’t laying beside me. I got up and walked in the kitchen to him sitting at the table staring at his coffee mug. “Good morning” I said buttoning up my shirt getting ready for the day. He looked up at me and smiled “good morning” he said using that same grin again. “What”? I asked slowly feeling a pit in my stomach. I remember the thought racing through my mind like crazy. As if I lied to myself and that it did all In fact happen. “Oh nothing” he said getting up and walking to his room. I sighed and relaxed. Maybe I was just going crazy.

1lebts6,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1lebts6/navigating_differences_in_income/,Navigating Differences in Income,"Hey GayBros, so I've been in a relationship this year that has been amazing. Literally everything about it was what I always dreamed of. Except one thing.

My partner makes a SIGNIFICANT amount more than me and although he hasn't made it an issue, money talk comes up probably more often then in most relationships.

The main thing is we get paid in two different currencies. My currency (¥) is very weak against his ($) and on top of that the average salary in ¥ is about 3x less than the average salary in $s. BUT he's not making the average. His is maybe double that and for me it's about 6x what I make when you do the conversion.

So basically he is living six times above my belt when it comes to how he spends. I'm not jealous by the way. That isn't the issue. The issue is he's used to a more... expensive lifestyle and I can never keep up. He ends up paying for me so I can join him in his lifestyle. He's very generous about it.

But it leaves me feeling incredibly insecure. Because the house we live in (he bought before he met me so it's way unaffordable for me). He basically pays most of the rent and bills. 

I pick up some when I can but because of how I'm paid my income differs month to month. Some months I can only afford to pay for my own living expenses and bills.

But when I can I throw him a few hundred $ to go to rent and I'll pick up a utility. I also usually buy him breakfast and coffee in the morning (so one of his meals).

I'm trying my best but I fear eventually he'll get sick of me not contributing enough even though I just financially cannot do more. 

As for getting a better job... I'm making about average in my currency and wages haven't increases past this in 40 years here in Japan. So it's difficult to find a better paying job in my country. He works for an American company - why he gets paid in $. 

So, if you have any advice on how to navigate this sort of thing please let me know! I just want him to feel like I'm putting in my weight!",1,1750235197.0,askgaybros,4,1.0,False

I love reading about everyone’s trips and suggestions so hoping you might be able to share some wisdom! 

I’m heading to Donegal in July for a couple of days. My husband’s family live in Derry so I’ve explored quite a lot of the city and north coast over the past 15 years! We’ve done a few day trips along the Inishowen 100 such as Malin Head and Kinnagoe Bay but never stayed in Donegal. My husband hasn’t stayed in Donegal since he was a kid on family holidays so his knowledge isn’t the best. We’re going to be basing ourselves in Letterkenny. We’re flying into Belfast. 

We’re a mid thirties couple travelling with an 18 month old. My in laws will also be with us. We have a car! We’re quite big foodies and our favourite thing about the north coast is the coffee shops and places to eat. Such a great food scene there! 

We don’t mind driving for a few hours as long as there are places to stop along the way to let our toddler run off some steam! We’re looking for beautiful beaches, stunning viewpoints, cute coffee shops and ruins.

Me and a friend will be going to Crete, flying to Chania at the end of August (specifically on 29th). It will be for 5 nights, staying in Stavros. We will have a car available entire time.

Now I have built an itinerary for the trip, which I am gonna share here and my question is ""Am I missing something""? As in something must-see, some hidden gem that is better than things I have on my itinerary etc. You will see from the itinerary, we are mostly interested in history, nature, local culture and authentic cusisine (and chilling).

**Day 1:**

Just the regular, fly in, get the car, check in, explore Stavros, chill on the beach. Maybe a leisure stroll towards *Lera Cave*.

**Day 2:**

Chania town day. *Archeological museum*, *Maritime museum*, *the port* and the *lighthouse*. Plus just walking around Old Town, getting a coffee and some pastries, getting a lunch. Depending on how it goes and how quick we are, either go back to Stavros or stay longer also for dinner.

**Day 3:**

Start with *archeological site of Aptera* in the morning, then move to *Omprogialos beach* for some snorkling and chill and have a late lunch / early dinner in *Ntounias taverna* on the way back.

**Day 4:**

Start a day with a hike in *Imbros Gorge* (I know there is also Samaria gorge but my friend doesn't want to go on a 6+ hour hike when we are staying only for 5 nights). Then lunch in *Taverna Vatalos*, moving on to *Frangokastello castle* and beach. This entire schedule after the gorge is probably the weakest part as it's pretty far for just a castle - and the taverna and beach are only part of this because they are close by, not because they are known for something special.

**Day 5:**

Start the day with *Agia Triada Monastery* and *Gouverneto Monastery* because they are close by and on the way to *Botanical Park & Gardens of Crete*. Lunch in the restaurant there and then go back and chill in Stavros as we fly out early next day.
