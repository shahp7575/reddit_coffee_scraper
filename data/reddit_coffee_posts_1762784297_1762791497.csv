I'm (F22) looking to make genuine friends around the Atlanta area. I'm a senior at GSU and literally have struggled as a commuter trying to make friends at school. I'm literally soooo bored all the time since I barely have anyone to hang with (other than my boyfriend and like one friend) so it would be nice to meet others in similar situations. I feel like I'm at stage in life where everyone my age is so busy graduating, finding a job, and starting life. And don't get me wrong, so am I but I honestly would love to break free from this routine to have fun and hang out.

I LOVE coffee and have a huge list of coffee places around GA that I frequent. I would love to have some friends who are down to have coffee, yap, and do other hobbies like coloring, crafting, etc. Would love to make this a regular thing where we visit a new coffee shop, get a treat, and do our hobbies together.

Making friends is so scary to me as an introvert. This is my poor desperate attempt at making friends hopefully. So if you're interested and as lonely as me :') let me know!",2,1762791182.0,GaState,0,1.0,False

1othvxt,https://i.redd.it/97qrmgsueg0g1.jpeg,A Clarified Cuba Libre to Beat Tom Cruise!,"Back in 1988 Tom Cruise starred in the movie Cocktail, playing the role of Brian Flanagan, a young bartender who quickly made a name for himself thanks to his charm and flair bartending. In fact, this movie helped make flair bartending really popular, and while I’m not an expert at it, I did practice some flair at the start of my career. But along with flair, another thing that marked my start in bartending was thinking that all cocktails had to be shaken… leading me to shake a Cuba Libre. 



You can picture what happened after shaking a carbonated cocktail, but today I’m here to redeem myself, and to see if I can make a cocktail that could beat Brian Flanagan’s Cuba Libre. For this, I’ll quickly clarify this cocktail, so grab some coconut milk and your favorite rum, because it’s Cocktail Time!



**\*\*Clarified Coke & Lime\*\***

● 500mL · 17oz Coca Cola

● 90mL · 3oz Fresh Lime Juice

● 150mL · 5oz Coconut Milk



First mix the coke and lime juice, then stir it until you have removed the carbonation. After that, pour the mixture over the coconut milk, and leave it to sit for about half an hour. We’ll now filter this through a coffee filter, giving us clarified coke and lime. 



**\*\*Clarified Rum & Soda\*\***

● 120mL · 4oz Diplomatico Planas

● 240mL · 8oz Clarified Coke & Lime

● 8 drops 20% Saline Solution

● 1 CO₂ cartridge

● Lime Peel Strings Garnish



Add the ingredients into a carbonator, I’m going with the iSi Twist & Sparkle, then charge it with a single CO₂ cartridge. You can keep this in the fridge, but we’ll serve it right away in a glass with a clear ice spear, garnishing with lime peel strings. While this is a cocktail that’s hard to add flair to, I think it’s a success in being a delicious Cuba Libre. If you make it, let me know your thoughts down in the comments, and until next time, cheers!

1othuj2,https://www.reddit.com/r/70s/comments/1othuj2/i_am_gifting_my_mom_a_nostalgicthemed_christmas/,I am gifting my mom a nostalgic-themed Christmas gift this year that brings back all of the good memories of her childhood. I would love some ideas to include in her box!,"Hi everyone! Christmas is right around the corner and I've been prepping for gifts. I have some **beautiful** memories from Christmas as a child. My parents were very poor, but they are both artists and incredibly creative! They knew Christmas wasn't always about the ""stuff"" but making magic with what you have and with who you love. There are so many small, magical things from Christmases, birthdays, etc. that I will remember for the rest of my life. To this day, even though the \*magic\* of Christmas feels different as an adult, my mom still finds ways to add whimsy and joy to the holiday season. 

A little bit of context about my mom and the inspiration behind my gift idea: She had an extremely difficult childhood. She was the oldest of 4 kids, so with an alcoholic father and an absent mother, she basically raised all of her siblings as a child herself. She always made sure they never went without food or clean clothes, and relentlessly protected them from any (for lack of a better term) *parental discourse* in the house. In the midst of everything, she remained strong and positive, and and made sure everyone remembered that they were loved and protected.

Anyone who is familiar with childhood trauma knows that there are certain moments or eras of your life that your brain will block from your memory, especially if you spent the majority of that time in fight or flight mode. This is the case with my mom, but even now at 63 years old, she cherishes clings to all of the *good* memories. She has told me countless stories about how being 10 years old was the happiest time of her childhood. She remembers playing dress-up with her baby sisters, sitting in the salon with her grandmother, and playing baseball in the street with her brother. She remembers some of the records that she burned through on her turn table, and the celebrity boys she had crushes on lol.

*All of that to say*, this year for Christmas I am going to be gifting her a nostalgic-themed Christmas box that includes some of her favorite toys, music, candy, and anything else that brings back all of those wonderful memories of being a kid. She was born in 1962, so I'm leaning towards items that were memorable in the early-mid 70's for older kids and tweens. Right now I have some chick-o-sticks, an old baseball, a baton, a baby doll, a bottle of Charlie Blue from Revlon, gardenia scented lotion (still her fav), and an original copy of a Tiger Beat magazine with Donny Osmond on the cover lol. **This is where I need your help.** What are some other things you can remember from that time that brought back happy and fun memories? Any ideas are welcome; toys, makeup, clothing, music, candy/snacks, anything that sends you back in time to being a kid in the 70's. 

I really want to give my mom a Christmas morning that revives the whimsy and warmth of feeling all of the Christmas magic as a kid. ***I*** want to be the adult sitting on the couch in my robe drinking coffee watching her eyes light up on Christmas morning. She deserves to be able to entertain that kid-like spirit that still thrives within her. Thank you in advance for any help!!

**TLDR**: I'm giving my mom a Christmas that makes her feel like a kid again by gifting her nostalgic things from her childhood from the 70's! Needing recommendations! ",1,1762790979.0,70s,1,1.0,False

Not DIY for now.,"Most of the posts I've read here on this topic usually end up advising people to DIY, especially those about Lotus. It's possible that I go the DIY route in the future, but right now I am not. I live in a really small NYC apt and have limited space; my wife is not enthusiastic at all about me getting a scale, minerals, bottles, etc. since my coffee and equipment already occupy a fair amount of space. So, I would really like to hear about people's experiences with Lotus water in particular; I'm not that interested in Apax due to price and lack of transparency with regards to ingredients. Right now I'm using TWW at about 1/3 strength and it's fine, definitely a noticeable improvement over tap or filtered water. Would Lotus water be an upgrade over TWW or just different?

“Hey girl. Ready to go shopping?”



“Kai?!” Lumina said. 



The Flareon put on a cocky grin. “‘Sup? I just finished…. Uh, bathing.” *Oh dear.* He thought, *does she think I’m weird*?



Lumina snorted. “Sure. StaryuGuarantee we go. But I’m sure you were just rizzing the girls up, on what you call, ‘bathing’” She  added, snarkily. Walking past him, the Glaceon radiated cold grace and regality, like, literally, she emitted cold air. 



Kai followed her hesitantly, hearing the screams and shouts of excitement and desperation of Midnight, Esmeralda and Hermes. “Lumi… Alic—“ as soon as he muttered out the name of her mother, Lumina whirled around defiantly, her fangs bared. “Don’t mention her name.” She demanded, her eyes on fire. “She told me I was too “overprotective” of things. Oh please. It’s a *sofa*. Everyone uses it. Don’t accuse me. My, ‘mother’ who so loved me wanted me to change my personality, Kai. My *personality*. *Your* mother. Tell me what did she do?” Her ears awaited an answer as they twitched expectantly. “Kai.”



“She… she took care of me. She embraced the Flareon I’ve become. For good or for bad.” Kai said, lowering his ears. “I-i’m sorry, Lumina. I-i didn’t know.” 



Suddenly, the Glaceon perked up, her eyes widening. “I—i shouldn’t have spilled my private history. Neither should have you.” She blushed deep red. Her tail curling up defensively around her paws.



“It’s alright.” Kai whispered. “I’m sure our Eeveelution friends have heard enough. Let’s go.” He cocked his head towards the Leafeon and Vaporeon who had their ears pressed against the glass. 



Apparently just realizing how much could’ve heard her past, Lumina scowled, and frowned at their direction, the two Pokémon suddenly busy wiping the glass of ‘smudges’. 



The whole time the walked on the path, the nearest city a mile away, she remained quiet, quite unable to look at his face. 

Doing his best to comfort her of her horrid past, Kai let her lean against him, his tail gently brushing hers. Few times, she pulled away in embarrassment, but only to lean against his warmth again. 



“I guess you’re one of the only ones I’ve ever mentioned this to… aside from Inari, a shiny Zoroark that I’m related to. He’s living a happy life with (spoiler, spoiler, spoiler!) April, he had a bad past too. Perhaps even worse than mine.” Lumina said, her eyes glazed over, as if envisioning what could be happening to Inari. 



“Really?” Skepticism crept into the Flareon’s heart. *The second one.*

“I- again, I guess Gaia and Kym are the third and fourth, but… considering they’d probably spread it, it wouldn’t be much a secret anymore. Who ever heard it first, second, last… the placement doesn’t matter.” 



“Would it be weird, if I asked you on how to confess to someone?” Kai asked suddenly, out of the blue. 

“No… unless you’re taken.” Lumina answered, just until they reached the city. “My suggestion? Tell them how much they mean to you. Like, not the siblingy way. C’mon. There’s the furniture shop. Elburr’s Furniture.”



Together, side by side, they entered the shop, and greeted by Elburr Kittes, the Excadrill.



“Hey yer, Lumina and Kai. Need to buy sem furniture?” He said. 



“Hey Mr. Kittes!” Lumina said in return, with very forced cheerfulness. “We’re looking for a sofa, the StaryuGuarantee brand?” 

Elburr nodded his head along her lines. “Yes. C’mere Miss.” he squinted at Kai. “Or… Mrs…?” He muttered faintly. Both Eeveelutions chose to ignore it. 



While Kai waited, he had the thought to rush to buy coffee, and maybe just maybe… 

While his thoughts wandered ‘round, he decided he’d just wait. Patiently. Which he was not good at. 



Until he was forced to go out and buy…



Something.



After a devastating 30 minutes of going around the city, he got a text from Lumina.



*Kai. I’m done. I told Elburr we’ll hitch a ride with him back home. Will expect you within five minutes. 🙂*



He rushed to Elburr’s Furniture, reuniting with Lumina. The two promptly went into the truck, along with Elburr, who was driving. 



Time skip ten minutes.



“Oh my Arceus- StaryuGuarantee, again?!” Gaia yelled. “Also, Lumi, we didn’t know your story was a sob story! Kym cried for a beastly ten minutes!”

“Oh, is it bigger?” Kym added inquisitively.

“LUMIIIIINA! WE ALL GOT THE BEANS FROM YOUR STORY—HOLY MILTANK! WE DIDN’T EXPECT IT TO BE LIKE THAT!” Athena came scramming out of the door, shouting so loud that Kai was sure she could be heard a mile away. 



“Give her space.” Grumbled Elburr, stuffing the box into the house. “Kai. I suspect you boys can handle it?” 

Kai nodded vigorously. “Yes, Mr. Kittes.”

“Good.” 



After he left, Lumina went indoors and went up. “See you guys later.” She muttered. 

“W-wait! Lumiiiiii!” Gaia cried. “We still need to talk to you!” She wailed. 

Esmeralda popped out behind the TV, putting her controller down. “They told us everything.” She told Kai. “I told ‘em to not, but they love their gossip. I had to calm everyone down…” 

“Thanks for the effort.” Kai told her gratefully. “How’d the others react?” 

“Let’s see…

Midnight didn’t care that much, Hermes dropped the controller and zoomed around the living room… Athena at first didn’t really turn crazy, until now. I… told them not to gang up on her. Oh, and Adam thought it was *hilarious*. Can you believe the nerve?” Esmeralda still seemed agitated, yet she pulled together well. 



“I’ll go to her.” Kai went up the stairs and knocked into her room before entering. Lumina was on her bed, reading a book. 



“Lumina? I care about you. A lot. Like, a lot lot lot kinda thing I mean you wouldn’t um, believe it.” He sputtered. 



The Glaceon peered over and smiled. “Yeah. You too.” She went up to him and kissed him tenderly.  “You took my advice. Even if it wasn’t the real way to go.

I ran to the café as fast as I could, but she had already left. I felt horrible, like I had completely blown my chance. I texted her an honest apology, explaining what happened, expecting her to be annoyed or just ignore me.

To my surprise, she replied calmly, laughed a little, and said she understood. We ended up rescheduling and actually had a really nice time a few days later.

And the way my Raynaud’s simply ✨cannot cope✨ no matter how many drastic measures I take to stay warm (out here looking like the freaking Michelin tire dude and my extremities still threaten to freeze off). No amount of love for my kids will ever overpower my raging hatred for snow.

Anyway, if it’s not obvious, we just got our first snow of the season, and of course the littles are very excited to go outside. My 4yo, especially — I swear she was a polar bear or something in a past life. And I’m weighing the pros and cons of calling up one of the local college kids to take them outside 😂.

1othn5r,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1othn5r,Got our CR review in - Are we cooked with this score?,"We sent a bag of our SL28 into coffee review for the first time and got our score back this weekend. Not gonna lie, definitely took the wind out our sails - we were hoping to score a bit higher, but we’re glad to get feedback as it’s what we wanted. After reflecting a bit (and conferring with Helm Coffee) we were able to pin point why: Even though we usually roast SL28 on the medium side, we think we took it too medium for the higher brackets, as most yeast inoculated coffees taste the same when developed longer, and we should’ve sent our Sidra in which was considerably lighter. 

Our sl28 is amazing though, I prefer it how we roasted it compared to the light profiles we cupped, and based on their grading system it’s not a bad score at all -  we definitely aren’t complaining - but when JBC scored a 98 earlier this month, a 93 seems like a “sufficiently roasted” score lol. Most roasters we talked with about it said we should be stoked, especially for a first time score, but I wanted to know: from a consumer point of view, what are your thoughts on seeing a 93? First impressions? Should we even bother advertising it on IG? Should we bother posting a story about it? Or would this be some negative marketing? TIA

My husband and I split up eight months ago. I'd been having an affair and he found out. The divorce isn't final yet but we're separated and living apart. He moved back in with his parents while I kept the house.

The affair started about a year before we separated. I met this guy at a coffee shop near my work. He was charming. Attentive. Everything my husband wasn't at the time. My husband worked long hours and we'd grown distant. I'm not making excuses but that's how it happened.

When my husband found out he was devastated. His whole family turned on me. His sister especially. She sent me this long message about how I destroyed her brother and how I was selfish and cruel. I blocked her after that.

But here's the thing. The guy I'd been seeing, let's call him my boyfriend since that's what he became after the separation, he kept telling me we should go public. Make a statement. Show everyone we were serious and not just some fling.

""We're together now,"" he said one night while we were having dinner. ""Why are we hiding? Your marriage is over.""

""His family hates me,"" I told him.

""So what? Let them see you're happy. Let them see you've moved on.""

When the wedding invitation came I almost threw it away. My husband's sister getting married. Why would she invite me? Then I saw it was addressed to both of us, probably sent before the separation became official in the family gossip chain.

My boyfriend saw it on the counter. ""We should go,"" he said.

""Are you insane?""

""I'm serious. Show up with me. Show them you're not ashamed. That we're the real thing.""

I thought about it. Part of me wanted to prove something. That I wasn't just a cheater who ruined her marriage for nothing. That this relationship was real and worth it.

So I said yes.

I RSVP'd for two. I didn't clarify who my plus one was. I figured they'd assume I was bringing a friend or coming alone.

The day of the wedding my boyfriend was excited. He bought a new suit. Kept talking about how we were finally going to be open about everything.

We showed up at the venue and I could feel the stares immediately. My husband was there with his family. His mom's face went white when she saw me. His sister, the bride, looked like she wanted to murder me.

My husband just stared. He looked thin. Tired.

""What are you doing here?"" his mom asked.

""I was invited,"" I said. Kept my voice steady even though my hands were shaking.

My boyfriend put his arm around me. ""We're here to celebrate,"" he said. Smiled like this was all normal.

The ceremony was tense. I could feel everyone looking at us. Whispering. But my boyfriend seemed unfazed. He held my hand the whole time.

At the reception he kept saying we should mingle. Introduce ourselves as a couple. I was drinking more than I should have. Trying to calm my nerves.

Then came the speeches.

The best man went first. Then the maid of honor. Then my boyfriend leaned over and whispered, ""I'm going to say something.""

""What? No. You can't.""

""Watch me.""

He got up before I could stop him. Walked right up to the microphone. The room went quiet.

""Hi everyone,"" he said. ""I know I'm not on the official speech list but I wanted to say something about love. Real love. The kind that's worth fighting for.""

I felt sick. My husband's family was staring daggers at me.

""See, I'm here with someone special tonight,"" he continued. He pointed at me. ""And we've been through hell to be together. But that's what real love is. It's not settling. It's not staying in something that doesn't work. It's having the courage to choose happiness.""

People were shifting in their seats. Uncomfortable. The bride looked furious.

Then the groom stood up. He walked toward my boyfriend. His face was red.

""Get away from that microphone,"" the groom said.

""I'm just finishing,"" my boyfriend said. Still smiling.

""I know who you are,"" the groom said. His voice was loud now. ""You're the guy who wouldn't leave my fiancée alone. The one she had to get a restraining order against.""

The room erupted. Everyone started talking at once.

I sat there frozen. My boyfriend's face changed. The smile dropped.

""That was a misunderstanding,"" he said.

""You followed her for months,"" the groom said. ""Showed up at her work. Her gym. Sent her hundreds of messages.""

My boyfriend looked at me. ""Let's go,"" he said.

But I couldn't move. My brain was trying to catch up.

""You knew her?"" I asked.

""We should leave,"" he said again.

The bride was crying now. My husband came over to their side. His whole family was surrounding them.

""You brought him here?"" my husband asked me. His voice was quiet but I could hear the disgust.

""I didn't know,"" I said.

""You didn't know? You've been sleeping with him for over a year and you didn't know he stalked my sister?""

The pieces started falling into place. The way my boyfriend always asked about my husband's family. Seemed interested in his sister's life. Asked questions about her.

""He was using you,"" my husband said. ""To get close to her.""

My boyfriend grabbed my arm. ""We're leaving. Now.""

I pulled away from him. Looked at his face and saw a stranger.

Security came and escorted him out. He was yelling the whole way. Saying it wasn't like that. That the bride was crazy. That she'd wanted him and changed her mind.

I left right after. Drove home in a daze.

The next day the truth came out. My boyfriend, the man I'd destroyed my marriage for, had been obsessed with my husband's sister for three years. He'd met her at some work conference. She'd rejected him. He became fixated.

When she got the restraining order he backed off for a while. Then he found out she was engaged. Found out who her brother was. And apparently decided the best way to get close to her again was through me.

Everything he'd said. Every moment we'd shared. It was all to use me.

I called him and he didn't deny it. Said I was a means to an end. That I'd been convenient. Easy.

My husband won't speak to me. His family is considering pressing charges for something, I'm not sure what. The bride is a mess.

And I'm sitting here realizing I gave up my marriage for a man who saw me as a tool to stalk someone else.

So I guess my question is, am I the one who should be apologizing to everyone, or was I just as much a victim here?

1othmm7,https://www.reddit.com/r/humandesign/comments/1othmm7/how_ive_been_putting_myself_in_flow_deconditioned/,How I've been putting myself in flow (deconditioned?) state effortlessly and consistently,"Hello guys, as some of you who have read my posts might know, I really enjoy experimenting and sharing some of my insights in a practical way so that those who are curious can test them for themselves.

For the last couple of months, I’ve been playing with the idea of how there are certain times when I can move through my days effortlessly. I don’t need to think about what to do, I just know what comes next. It’s like something deeper than my mind takes over and guides each step with clarity and calm. During those times, my mental noise almost disappears, and my energy feels clean and focused.

In August of this year, I published a book about energy and health. The interesting part isn’t the book itself but how I was able to lock in for weeks, unwavering, and finish a 600-page manuscript in less than a month. That level of consistency and focus didn’t come from discipline or external pressure; it came from being in that effortless state where thinking stops being necessary and doing becomes natural.

Given my channels, the book might have been an intuitive download or simply my design working as it’s meant to (16-48, 18-58, 52-9). But as curious as I am, I wanted to figure out what mental and physical conditions allowed that state to happen, and whether it could be replicated consistently without burning out or forcing it.

Now, you might be wondering why I’d want to consciously recreate such a state instead of just living life as it comes. The answer is simple: when I’m in that state, my mind quiets down almost completely. I don’t have to fight it, negotiate with it, or push through resistance. That alone feels like a massive upgrade in quality of life, and it makes everything else (creativity, productivity, even relationships) flow naturally.

So, here’s what I’ve been doing that seems to trigger that state almost every day. Remember, this is my personal experiment, not advice or a “fix.” 

My goal is simply to describe what I’ve noticed so others can observe if similar patterns emerge for them too.

It’s a well-documented phenomenon in behavioral science that motivation (or in this case, the willingness to act) often comes after movement, not before it. In other words, it’s easier to move and then feel motivated than to wait to feel motivated before moving. Knowing this, I started experimenting with a simple, repeatable sequence that keeps working with surprising consistency:

→ 1) Natural Sequence → 2) Authority and Strategy → 3) Movement and Momentum → 4) Repetition and Integration →

Let’s go through them one by one.

1)Natural Sequence:

This is how you normally start your day and how you move through it. The more conditioned you are (by habits, stress, or digital noise) the more distorted this sequence becomes.

Think of this step as the transition between waking up and entering the mental narrative your mind already has waiting for you. If you pick up your phone first thing and dive into social media, you’re basically handing control over to your conditioning. You’ve activated a chain of automatic reactions before your body even has a chance to speak.

What works better (at least for me) is to stay offline for the first 30–60 minutes.

Drink a glass of water, stretch, go for a walk, do a few push-ups, meditate, drink your coffee or tea. Let your body wake up before your mind starts giving instructions. Your variables and your design will hint you at what’s correct for you, but generally speaking: avoid screens first thing after opening your eyes.

That small choice alone can completely change the tone of your day.

2)Authority and Strategy:

If step 1 is done correctly, your internal signals become easier to hear.

You’ll notice how decisions start to feel simpler and more embodied. When the mental noise drops, your natural Authority can actually be felt more clearly. This step is about acting from that clarity, not from what your mind thinks is correct.

Remember: your mind is not here to make decisions. It’s here to observe.

When your body leads and the mind follows, you’re no longer fighting yourself. That’s when you begin to notice the difference between reacting from conditioning and responding from alignment.

3)Movement and Momentum:

Once you start acting from your body, the cycle sustains itself.

You begin taking more aligned actions, which build momentum naturally. This momentum isn’t “hustle energy”; it’s more like a steady current that carries you forward. It feels like flow because it’s effortless and self-reinforcing.

This is also where motivation starts showing up on its own. You don’t have to think your way into doing something; you just find yourself doing it, and it feels right.

This is the exact moment where flow appears, and you realize that all along it wasn’t about pushing harder, but about listening better.

4)Repetition and Integration:

Once you’ve experienced this sequence a few times, it starts to build its own rhythm.

Each time you follow it, your body learns to trust it a little more. The process becomes second nature, and the mind slowly learns that it doesn’t need to control everything to keep you safe.

This is the key to integration: repetition without pressure.

Every time you act correctly for yourself, even in small ways, your system recalibrates. Over time, you’ll notice that this becomes your default state and that’s what being deconditioned really feels like. You don’t need to think about it; it just happens.

So, that’s what I’ve been experimenting with, and it’s giving me consistent results.

If this sounds too simple, that’s because it is. It’s only the mind that insists things must be complex in order to work. But following Authority and Strategy or simply learning to trust your body again isn’t really that complicated.

Hope you find something in this worth testing for yourself 🫶",2,1762790507.0,humandesign,0,1.0,False

1othmfh,https://www.reddit.com/r/LockedInMan/comments/1othmfh/the_5minute_habits_that_made_me_smarter_calmer/,"The 5-minute habits that made me smarter, calmer, and way more focused","Let’s just say it. Most people are chasing huge changes when their attention span can barely outlast a TikTok. Everyone wants to do a complete 180 overnight, from “burnt out zombie” to “optimized beast.” But here’s the part no one tells you: it’s the boring, small stuff done ridiculously consistently that moves the needle the most. Even 5 minutes daily.

No, this isn’t some “discipline is sexy” hustle post. This is based on real research, timeless books, and psychology that doesn’t suck. Too many influencers repackage discipline with a bunch of flash, zero science, and dopamine-chasing advice that doesn’t last. This post exists because attention is currency now. And real transformation rarely goes viral.

There’s a reason James Clear’s Atomic Habits sold over 15 million copies. Because it works. Not because it's flashy, but because it’s sustainable. Behavioral scientist BJ Fogg also backs this with his research from Stanford: tiny habits set low-friction triggers that rewire your brain without overwhelm. Even the American Psychological Association backs this in their 2023 behavior change report, emphasizing that small, repeated actions help regulate stress and increase self-trust.

Here’s the hard truth: there’s no “hack” for self-respect. You earn it in five-minute blocks. Here’s how.

\- Write 3 sentences in a journal each morning. Doesn’t need to be deep. Just “What am I avoiding? What am I grateful for? What’s one win from yesterday?” According to Dr. Andrew Huberman’s lab, expressive writing boosts working memory and emotional resilience over time. It wires your mind for clarity instead of chaos. Do not overthink it. Just do it with your morning coffee.

\- Read 2 pages of a real book daily. That’s it. Start with Ryan Holiday’s The Daily Stoic, or something from the Farnam Street mental models collection. This trains your focus muscle. Cal Newport (author of Deep Work) says this analog activity is actually one of the fastest ways to detox from digital distraction and retrain your attention span. Don’t aim to finish a book. Just return to it daily.

\- 5 minutes of stillness. Sit. No phone. Just silence or ambient sound. Try the “box breathing” Navy SEALs use: 4-second inhale, 4 hold, 4 exhale, 4 hold. Rinse and repeat. The Center for Healthy Minds shows this triggers a downshift in stress hormones and stabilizes mood. You’ll notice it in just one week. It’s like a hard reset for your nervous system.

\- Make your bed every morning. I know. It sounds basic. But there’s deep psychology behind completing a tiny task after waking up. Organizational psychologist Dr. Benjamin Hardy calls this a “keystone action”a small move that signals to your brain: “I’m someone who finishes things.” The snowball starts rolling. Your brain doesn’t care if it’s a billion-dollar pitch or hospital corners. It just registers momentum.

\- Rewrite your goals in your own handwriting. Just once a day. Not to manifest. But to reconfirm. Keep it to 3 goals max. Neuroscientist Dr. Tara Swart talks about this in her book The Sourcehandwriting your goals activates the reticular activating system (RAS), which filters your subconscious attention to notice things that align with your aims. It’s not magic. It’s selective attention, trained by ritual.

\- One micro-movement. Just one set of pushups. Or stretching. Or walking around the block. Physical therapist Kelly Starrett refers to this as “motion snacks”micro doses of movement to break the paralysis of sedentary life. Exercise science backs it: even 1 set of movement increases dopamine, according to the Journal of Neuroscience. This one habit alone has saved people from spiraling into full burnout.

\- Send one kind message. Tell someone you appreciate them. Comment something encouraging. Doesn’t matter if they respond. According to Harvard’s 85-year-long Grant Study on adult development, the single biggest predictor of long-term happiness? Quality relationships. This habit feeds connection and lifts both you and themeven digitally.

\- No phone first 5 minutes of the day. Seriously. That one rule alone changes your entire nervous system. Stanford’s Behavior Design Lab found that just consuming social content immediately upon waking massively spikes cortisol and lowers motivation. Keep it out of reach. You’ll slowly reclaim your mornings.

\- Set a timer for 5 minutes to work on that one thing you’ve been avoiding. That’s all. Just 5 minutes. This uses something called the “Zeigarnik Effect”your mind wants to finish what it starts. Once you begin, odds are you’ll go longer. But even if you don’t, you’ve started. That’s the win.

\- End your day with the sentence: “Today I’m proud of…” It rewires your self-image to notice micro-wins. Positive psychology research from Dr. Martin Seligman shows this reflection dramatically increases optimism and grit over time. You go from “never enough” to “building momentum.”



These aren’t viral habits. They’re invisible. That’s why they work.

Where people fail most is belief. They don’t think 5 minutes can matter. But 5 minutes becomes 15, which becomes identity. Small wins compound. Like interest in your self-confidence bank.

Real change is boring before it’s beautiful. But if you stay consistent, it becomes addictive in the best way.

1othlsa,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1othlsa/dibble_in_murders_in_the_bureau_part_23/,Dibble in Murders in The Bureau - Part 2/3,"The silence after Reba's declaration stretched like a wire pulled taut.

No one moved. No one spoke.

Yarrow’s breath came shallow beside me. Behind us the whole Bureau staff stood rigid, hung over and already doing the arithmetic on survival.

Reba turned from the bodies with the deliberate grace of someone who knew every eye was on her. Her armored boots made no sound on the carpet as she approached us. Behind her, the grey-clad guards moved to flank the doorway, sealing the office from view.

""This is a tragedy,"" she said. ""A double homicide. In a locked room. Within Bureau Headquarters itself.""

She let that sink in. Let us all feel the weight of the implication.

""The entire Compact would be justified in questioning this institution's competence,"" she continued. ""To believe this was anything other than an inside operation would be... incompetence of the highest order.""

Yarrow stiffened. ""Now wait a damn minute—""

""Chief Yarrow."" Reba said. ""You were the last person to speak with both victims. Publicly. In front of witnesses. During an altercation that, by multiple account you were inebriated""

Yarrow's ears flattened. His mouth opened, then closed.

""Exactly,"" Reba said. ""We are all suspects. Every single person in this room had motive, means, and opportunity. The killer is among us, or someone among us facilitated their entry.""

She paced slowly, her eyes scanning the assembled detectives. We were still rumpled, bloodshot, the stink of stale alcohol clinging like evidence.

""However,"" she said, and her tone shifted, became almost magnanimous, ""I understand the... delicacy of this situation. The political ramifications. The damage to interspecies relations if handled poorly.""

I caught Yarrow's eye. His expression told me everything: Here it comes.

""Therefore,"" Reba announced, ""I am implementing an immediate review protocol. My forensic team—experts I have brought with me from the Scyline Investigative Corps—will process the scene according to Compact standards. No one enters that office until they have completed their work.""

She gestured to the grey-clad guards, who immediately began stringing up barrier tape across the doorway.

""In the meantime,"" Reba continued, ""all Bureau detectives will utilize available resources to compile preliminary reports on the events leading to these deaths. Timelines. Witness statements. Background on both victims. I want comprehensive analyses on my desk by end of shift.""

Someone in the back cleared his throat. ""Ma'am, that's... we're supposed to be investigating this collectively. Standard protocol for internal—""

""Standard protocol,"" Reba interrupted, her voice dropping to permafrost temperatures, ""died in that office. What I'm offering you is an opportunity. The most thorough, most insightful report will be taken into serious consideration for future advancement within the restructured Bureau.""

The temperature in the room shifted.

I watched it happen. Eyes slid toward each other, hands drifted to terminals, decades-old alliances cracked under self-preservation.

She'd turned us into competitors. Into rivals. Into suspects investigating each other.

""Dismissed,"" Reba said. ""I expect excellence.""

The bullpen erupted into controlled chaos.

Detectives scattered to their desks, some already pulling up files, others huddling in suspicious clusters. The camaraderie of last night's party had evaporated like morning dew under a killing sun.

I stood at my desk, staring at the spot where Kazen had placed the crown.

The stack of files still sat there: neglected case reports, repair requisitions, the usual clutter of a detective who ignored image standards. The crown was gone.

""Dibble.""

Yarrow materialized at my elbow, his voice low and urgent. He was holding two cups of the terrible coffee, which meant he was serious. He only drank the terrible coffee when he was serious.

""Walk with me,"" he said.

We moved to the far corner of the bullpen, near the broken vending machine that had been ""pending repair"" for three months. It was the closest thing we had to a dead zone—no terminals, no active surveillance feeds, just the constant electric hum that might cover a quiet conversation.

Yarrow handed me the coffee. I took it without comment.

""She's turning us against each other,"" he said, his grey ears twitching with barely suppressed anger. ""That 'review' is bullshit. She's creating chaos so we'll be too busy fighting for scraps to ask the real questions.""

""What questions?"" I asked, though I already knew.

""How did she arrive so perfectly timed?"" Yarrow's voice was tight. ""How did she have a full security detail ready to go? How did she know to come straight to Ras'Al's office?"" He took a long pull of coffee, grimaced. ""And most importantly—why is a Scyline, supposedly non-aligned, suddenly in charge of a Bureau investigation?""

I glanced across the bullpen. Reba stood at the center of the room, conferring with her forensic team. They moved around her like satellites, efficient and silent.

""She wants us distracted,"" I said. ""Fighting each other while her people control the scene.""

""Exactly."" Yarrow's eyes narrowed. ""Which means we need to find what she doesn't want us to see before her team 'finds' whatever they're planning to plant.""

I sipped the coffee. It was, somehow, worse than usual. ""You think she's framing someone.""

""I think she's framing you,"" Yarrow said bluntly. ""You noticed the crown, didn't you? Where Kazen left it?""

My hand tightened on the cup. ""On my desk. After his little speech about the Bureau's image.""

""Right. And this morning?""

""Not there.""

Yarrow nodded grimly. ""I noticed it too. Saw it last night when I was getting drinks. That stupid golden thing sitting on your paperwork like Kazen's personal 'fuck you' to your filing system."" He paused. ""Question is—where did it go?""

We both knew the answer. We'd both seen it in that office, cracked in half between two bodies.

""Someone moved it,"" I said slowly, working through the implications. ""After we passed out. Before morning. Someone took it from my desk and placed it at the crime scene.""

""To make it look symbolic,"" Yarrow added. ""Kazen’s crown, broken between the old leader and the new. A message about power, succession, institutional collapse."" He shook his head. ""It's too perfect. Too staged.""

""Which means the crime scene is theater,"" I said. ""Someone's trying to tell a story.""

""The question is whose story."" Yarrow glanced toward Reba again. ""And why she's so eager to control who tells it.""

I set down the coffee cup. My hangover was receding, pushed back by the sharp clarity of focused anger. ""We can't get into the office.""

""No,"" Yarrow agreed. ""But we can investigate everything else.""

I returned to my desk and logged into my terminal.

The Bureau's database held decades of cases, logs, personnel files, intel reports. Most of it opened to senior detectives like me; a few sections asked for codes I technically lacked.

Technically.

I pulled the external Compact diplomatic archives and filtered for Scyline representatives. The list was short; Scylines shunned high posts and worked through proxies and quiet trade deals. Websingers prized subtlety.

Reba's name appeared three years ago, listed as a junior ambassador during a minor trade dispute in the Outer Systems. Standard career trajectory, nothing noteworthy.

Then, one year ago, everything changed.

I found it buried in a public communiqué from a tense shipping-route negotiation: marked resolved, archived, ignored—exactly the record no one reads unless they’re hunting.

The dispute involved Ras'Al.

I leaned forward, scanning the document. The language was diplomatic, carefully neutral, but the substance was damning. Ras'Al, acting in his capacity as Bureau Director, had exposed a Scyline smuggling operation. Not massive, not particularly illegal by most standards, but embarrassing. The kind of thing that gets ambassadors recalled, careers derailed, reputations destroyed.

And Reba had been the public face of that operation.

The communiqué ended with a formal response from Reba, logged by a neutral third-party observer to ensure authenticity. It was brief, professional, and absolutely chilling:

""Director Ras'Al, your commitment to transparency is noted and will be remembered. A spider may weave a complex web, but it is the silent spider who survives the storm. Your day of reckoning will be one of quiet efficiency, not loud scandal. This matter is concluded.""

I read it three times.

Quiet efficiency. Not loud scandal.

I looked across the bullpen to where Reba stood, perfectly composed, directing her team with minimal gestures and maximum control. Silent. Efficient.

""Yarrow,"" I called softly.

He was at my desk in seconds. I angled the terminal so he could read.

His ears went flat against his skull. ""Oh, that's a motive,"" he breathed. ""That's a personal motive.""

""It's more than that,"" I said. ""It's a threat. Logged, witnessed, and specific enough to match exactly what just happened.""

""She planned this."" Yarrow's voice was barely a whisper. ""A year ago, she was already planning this.""

I sat back and let the facts line up. Reba had not simply arrived on time; she had stage-managed the whole play: amendments rammed through Compact Congress, Ras'Al ousted, Kazen installed, and now both corpses in a locked room while she stepped in before anyone could object.

It was elegant and terrifying, the exact move of a silent spider.

""We need to document this,"" Yarrow said urgently. ""Get it into our reports, make sure everyone—""

""She'll bury it,"" I interrupted. ""Or spin it. Make it look like we're desperately reaching for conspiracy theories because we're suspects ourselves.""

""So what do we do?""

I looked at the crown's empty space on my desk. ""We wait,"" I said. ""She's going to make a move. She has to. The theater isn't complete yet.""

We didn't have to wait long.

Three hours later, Reba's forensic team emerged from the office. They carried sealed evidence containers, digital recorders, and the carefully neutral expressions of professionals who'd found exactly what they'd expected to find.

Reba called an assembly.

We gathered in the bullpen, a loose semicircle of exhausted, suspicious detectives. The hangovers had faded, replaced by the headache of watching our workplace turn into a crime scene and a power grab at the same time.

Reba stood at the center, an evidence container in her hands.

""The initial findings,"" she announced, ""are revealing.""

The room held its breath.

""The killer was clever,"" she continued, her tone almost admiring. ""They attempted to stage the scene, to create a narrative of symbolic struggle: the old guard versus the new, the Director's crown literally broken between them.""

She held up the container. Inside, clearly visible, was the shattered crown.

""This crown,"" Reba said, ""was deliberately placed between the bodies. Not dropped. Not fallen. Placed. With care and intent.""

I felt Yarrow tense beside me.

""However,"" Reba continued, ""cleverness often breeds carelessness. In their haste to construct this symbolic tableau, the killer left evidence.""

She reached into the container with a gloved hand and extracted a smaller evidence bag. She held it up to the light.

Inside was a single fiber. Coarse. Grey. Unmistakable.

""This thread,"" Reba said, her voice carrying to every corner of the bullpen, ""was found snagged on a jagged edge of the broken crown. Our analysis confirms it is from a standard-issue Bureau overcoat. The material is distinctive—a coarse, low-quality earth wool blend that was part of the uniform distribution approximately thirty-five years ago.""

My stomach dropped.

Every eye in the room turned to me.

I was still wearing it. The same rumpled, grey overcoat Kazen had mocked last night. The same coat I wore every day because I couldn't be bothered with the Bureau's new ""image standards."" The same coat that was, indeed, made from coarse, low-quality wool.

Reba's gaze found mine across the bullpen. Her expression was perfectly neutral, but I saw the calculation behind it. The precision.

""Detective Dibble,"" she said, her voice lethally soft. ""You were the last person documented to have been near this crown. Multiple witnesses observed Envoy Kazen place it on your desk last night, during his address about the Bureau's image.""

The silence was absolute.

""And now,"" Reba continued, ""a fiber from a coat identical to yours is found snagged on that same crown at the murder scene."" She paused, letting the implication settle like ash. ""The evidence is circumstantial, but compelling.""

She took a step forward. ""Perhaps you can explain to us all, Detective, what happened to the crown after you... fell asleep?""

The question hung in the air like an execution blade.

I met her gaze steadily. Around us, I could feel the Bureau staff watching, judging, calculating whether I was a murderer or just convenient collateral in Reba's takeover.

Yarrow's hand moved fractionally toward his sidearm, nothing threatening, just the protective reflex of a partner who had watched my back for years.

But I didn't need protection. Not yet.

Because I'd already made up my mind about Reba. About this job. About the whole rotten institution that could be conquered so easily by someone patient enough to wait for the right moment.

I took a sip of cold coffee, grimaced, and set the cup down on my desk.

""Head Reba,"" I said calmly, ""I passed out drunk at my desk somewhere around 0300. The crown was still there when I lost consciousness. When I woke up, it was gone."" I gestured to the empty spot on my files. ""I assumed someone had moved it during cleanup.""

""And yet it appeared at the crime scene,"" Reba said.

""Yes,"" I agreed. ""Which means someone moved it between 0300 and whenever the murders occurred. I'd estimate that window at approximately four to five hours, given the state of rigor mortis I observed in both bodies.""

Her expression didn't change. ""You seem remarkably composed for someone being implicated in a double homicide.""

I shrugged. ""I'm also remarkably hung over, and this is remarkably bad coffee. If you're going to accuse me, do it formally. Otherwise, I have a preliminary report to file.""

For a moment, something flickered in her eyes. Surprise, maybe. Or recalculation.

Then it was gone, replaced by that same glacial neutrality.

""No formal accusation,"" she said smoothly. ""Yet. But I trust you'll make yourself available for further questioning, Detective. We wouldn't want anyone to think you're attempting to obstruct this investigation.""

""Wouldn't dream of it,"" I said.

Reba held my gaze for another long moment, then turned to address the room. ""Continue your work,"" she ordered. ""I expect those reports by end of shift. This institution's credibility depends on thoroughness.""

She swept toward Ras'Al's office, her guards falling in behind her like shadows.

Hi. It’s me (again!) I made a couple friends here so im reaching out again before the seasonal depression sets in lol.

I’m a menace with a sewing machine and the attention span of a fruit fly.

Looking for girlies who:
🧵 Quilt
🪡 Sew
🧶 Crochet
🪢 Cross-stitch
🎨 Craft unhinged things at 2am because that’s when inspiration hits


Here’s the fine print:
- Married. Ringed up. Off the market.
- Just looking for girlies, or/and anyone who identifies as a girly to talk to, craft with, hype up, trauma bond over tangled thread, the usual.

About me, because yes, I’m a yapper:
- Horror & thriller movies are comfort viewing
- I love to cosplay and make costumes!
- I  like to read
- Blind boxes have destroyed my financial stability
- Coffee is my kryptonite but i can settle for bubble tea
- Corporate girly by day, artist by night 
- In law school because apparently I like suffering
-  Very low-effort socializing: it’s winter, babe. I’m not going outside unless it’s dinner, lunch, movies, or rotting together in hoodies
-  Liberal / left-leaning and that matters to me. If you’re not, save us both the headache.

If you:
	•	Have 10+ unfinished projects
	•	Name your sewing machine
	•	Think fabric sales count as emergencies
	•	Want cozy craft friends who won’t judge your chaos

INSTRUCTIONS 

Preheat the oven to 325F. Prepare your quarter sheet pan with parchment paper.
In a bowl, add in the hot coffee and chocolate. Stir to combine until it is fully melted.
120 Grams Hot Brewed Coffee, 30 Grams Dark Chocolate
Add in the cocoa powder to bloom the chocolate.
60 Grams Cocoa Powder
Whisk in the sugar to combine.
200 Grams Sugar
Whisk in egg.
1 Egg
Add in all the dry ingredients – flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Mix until almost combined.
118 Grams Bob’s Red Mill 1-1 Gluten Free Flour, 2 Grams Baking Soda, 2 Grams Baking Powder, 1 Gram Salt
Stir in olive oil, buttermilk and vanilla. Mix until just combined.
60 Grams Olive Oil, 120 Grams Buttermilk, 2 Grams Vanilla
Pour it into the prepared pan. Place it into the hot oven for 35 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean with a couple crumbles.
Start the chocolate ganache while the cake is baking.
In a pot, add in the water, corn syrup and sugar together. Swish it around in the pan (without an tools) to ensure the sugar is all wet. Let it sit and bubble on medium heat until it is a light caramel colour.
30 Grams Water, 85 Grams Sugar, 15 Grams Corn Syrup
While the sugar is coming together, put the whipping cream into a bowl in the microwave for 45 seconds or until it is hot.
150 Grams Whipping Cream
Once the sugar pot is a caramel colour (I like mine a little darker to have a deeper richness to the chocolate ganache), turn it off. Pour the cream into the sugar mixture. It will bubble. Continue stirring it until the bubbles are gone and it is a caramel sauce.
In a stand mixer bowl, pour the caramel over the chocolate. Stir it until all of the chocolate is melted. Once the chocolate is all melted, cover it and set aside until it is room temperature.
190 Grams Chocolate
Once the cake is baked, remove it from the pan and put it on a cooling rack. Once the cake is fully cooled, you are ready to whip the ganache.
If the cake cools before the ganache is room temperature, stick it into the fridge to help it along.
In a stand mixer, using the paddle, whip the ganache while slowly adding chunks of room temperature butter to it. You will know when it is done, because it will be much lighter in colour. If it is not holding shape, it is too warm. Place it into the fridge for 10 minutes and then whip again.
190 Grams Butter
Once it is ready, decorate the cake as you see fit. I used an off-set knife to swirl it around. Enjoy.",2,1762790087.0,glutenfreerecipes,1,1.0,False

Hey friends! ☕️ Let’s dive into some essential questions:

🔍 Navigating Challenges:

In the face of global crises like COVID, how do we balance acceptance and proactive action? How do we find purpose when the world feels uncertain?

“Your attitude, not your aptitude, will determine your altitude.” Our mindset shapes our journey, even in tough times. (Zig Ziglar)

🚀 Striving for Abundance - Opportunities In Chaos 🌱

We all dream of being part of exciting innovations—Hyperloop trains, Neuralink, multi-planet exploration, and more. Yet, it can be frustrating when we feel constrained.

“In the midst of chaos, there is also opportunity.” Even when we feel held back, there’s room for growth and purpose. (Zohran Momdani)

🌟 Purpose in Action:

Purpose is about pushing forward despite obstacles. It’s about resilience, embracing both acceptance and ambition.

🤝 Leading with Empathy:

True leadership is about connecting with others, even in chaos. Michel’s journey highlights that balance between accepting reality and striving for more.

🌈 Creation & Healing:

Even amid challenges, our purpose shines through what we create. It’s about building solutions that heal and help, no matter the obstacles.

🌟 The Path Forward:

As you sip your coffee, reflect on how to balance acceptance with ambition. Let’s transform challenges into opportunities and lead with heart.",1,1762790066.0,Purpose,0,1.0,False

THE DATE.
After several coffee and breakfast meets ,She. 25f asked me 60m out for a date. I WILL SEE IF THE AGE DIFFERENCE AFFECTS  THE DATE.
I stopped by a florist on my way to pick her up ( I am old school )
I pick her up at her home around 6:30 pm. She had a nice home. A dog and a cat met me at the door as she answered. I gave her the flowers and she acted very surprised and said they are lovely and gave me a quick hug. She. looked up at me and made the come here motion. As I bent towards her she kissed my cheek. She went to her bedroom and, said I am just about ready to g o  ,have a seat. As I set down her cat jump on the couch next to me. And looked at me.like it was waiting on me to do something . She came by my hand and rubbeed it head against it..  Her dog did a thorough smelling of me for his  approvial as well . I did a small laugh and thought well I got their ok.About 10 minutes past and T came out
 and  said ok I'm ready. 
We walked to the car. She bumped into me as I open her door. She looked at me for a second smiled and said you don't have to do that.  I said I know. I shut the door after she was seated. As. I started the car I noticed she hadn't buckled up. So I.leaned over the console bent towards her she smiled and leaned her head towards me as I grab the seat belt and buckled her in she says oh ok. I told her I didn't want anything to happen to you. She smiled again and said looking out for for my safety ?thank you. As we drove to the theater  we talked about our day what we did, and little smsll talk. She was   humming to a song on the radio. And kept glancing my way. At the theater we parked she gets out of the car and walks over to my side of the car. As I open the door she pulls the door completely open and Sir. I get out of the car and she shuts the door, puts her arm around mine and said shall we. She held my arm tightly as we walked, I notice she put one of the flowers behind her ear. I told her she looked lovely.  She squeezed my arm and said thank you  you never commented on how I looked before.. I told her I thought you knew cause I Iook at you all the time I am with you. She squeezed  my arm again and said thank you.
I bought the tickets and we walked to the concession stand. We got sodas, one big tub of popcorn ,she imsisted, and a candy. We took our seats just as the light were lowering. I put the popcorn in her lap and told her my arms are longer I  can reach over here, she said ok, grabs my hand puts it around her  shoulders, and says this will make  it easier. I agreed as my finger tips lightly rubbed her shoulder. As the show starts she laid her head on my shoulder. I looked around briefly and noticed  others were looking our way. I tolder her we are being watched .T looks around and does a soft laugh. You want to give them a show.  I said nope not here. She said come here I want to whisper something .  Leaned towards her and she lightly kisses my lips.That will give them something to discuss. I almost said yes there this old long haired guy molesting his daughter.  But I knew better.
We enjoyed the show and held hands as we walked back to the car. As we approached the car she said get you fob out to open the door and go to your side and a I'll open my own door. Ok is all I said.
She suggested we go to a club for a couple hours, I agreed 
As I go in the rock music hits me. I loved it. There were maybe two people in there close to my age. The rest were 20's to maybe 40's
Waitress comes over and gets our drink order ,she's a Rum and Coke I drink scotch and soda on the rocks. We talked and laughed as she holds my hand ,when I hear a woman's voice hollering T... T looks up and recognized 3 of her friends. They come over to our table and hug each other. They ask  T if they could join us .T looks at me I said it's fine with me. They set with us and join the conversation. T introduces her friends to me. One of the ladies look at me , smiles and says to T.. so this is the guy. T puts her head on my shoulder and hugs me and said yes it's him. One of the girls setting  next to me says I like your long hair are the curls natural. Mind if I touch them. I said fine.she continue to compliment my hair as I noticed T and the other women whispering.The woman next to me starts to give me the 3rd degree trying to find out everything about me. I feel uncomfortable answering her and try to be not very forthcoming with my answers..
 I look at my phone and its midnight I suggested to T we might want to go and I show her the time she agrees and tells her friends good night. One of the women tells her laughing don't do anything I wouldn't do. T looks at her and says I am not that loose. And they all laughed. We leave and get into my car.I had nursed one drink all night T had about 4 and is a little loopy. She starts to sing with the radio. 
As we get to her door  T plays with a button on my shirt ands tells me she loved the date and asked if we could go out again I told her sure I really enjoyed her company. She then  asked me to come in for a bit and I said ok. She goes into the bedroom and comes out in a T- shirt and sweat pants and a blanket. She ask me to stay and watch TV with her.I agree. She gets all the pillows and put some by my head she puts one by me and puts her head next to me. The cat is on the back of the couch. The dog. Is at T. Feet. And a blanket is over both of us.  T turns the lights off and just the light of the TV is on.  T said she really did enjoy tonight I told her I did also she snuggles up close to me . I put my arm around her. She continues I didn't know if you were going to kiss me or not I leaned in and kissed her again a little longer this time..we kissed for about30 mins and talked.T and her pillow slides down to my lap and gets comfortable there.  I'm dozing off and notice T  is  asleep.
 I wake up in the morning from the sounds of  metal on metal.  I look up and T is coming towards me with a cup of coffee I reach out for it and she pulls it back and gives me a kiss and says good morning. I said you might not want to do that my breath is probably terrible she told me to go into the bathroom and gargle if you want. I told her thanks I need the use it also.  While I was in there she said I hope I didn't wake you last night. I had to adjust my pillow because there was a nice bulge in your pants.  I ignored her. Then said yes it was my bilfold and keys  T laughed. And said by the way I made you breakfast. Toast and eggs. 
I tried to freshen up and came out and enjoyed the breakfast. 
She is very nice and sweet woman  very independent doesn't rush into things. I thought. If I wanted to make love to her she would want to as well. But let's see if a physical relationship can play out here I am in no hurry.  After breakfast T walked me to my car and gave me a big kiss. I told her I was going out of town for some personal business and I would call her when I got back. She reminded me hey I owe you a dinner. I said I remember and drove off waving to her. Ok the age difference didn't seem to bother either one of us. We will continue what do you all think?

It's like, every time, there is something new that will wake me up at night. Blood sugar crash, being too hot, being too cold, randomly clogged nose, laying on my arm, choking on my saliva, bladder hurting from drinking too much water, neighbor partying, random baby crying, and, oh, would you look at that? A freaking nocturnal muscle cramp that I didn't even know existed before it happened to me in my 20 years of life.

Anyway, the newest addition to my collection is waking up from seemingly nothing. I think it's my cortisol rising at the wrong time. And it could be tied to my sympathetic system being way too active. I get startled by the simplest things in the day. And I don't know how to fix it.

I have this thing where caffeine makes me anxious and jittery instead of alert. If I drink the typical amount (\~500ml), I will get the entire package - anxiety attacks, heart palpitations, jitteriness. The interesting thing is that my body didn't use to react that way. I remember being 13-14 years old, drinking coffee and ACTUALLY getting the intended effect.

Another thing; I have tried allopregnanolone (a hormone with sedative qualities) for sleep, and I found I was resistant to it. Where others would experience drunk-like symptoms from it, I only experienced slight disorientation for 20 minutes and no perceived benefit for my sleep. I have heard of magnesium glycinate but I don't even know if the glycine would help me at this point.

Anyway, the point is that I miss when stimulants were stimulants, and sedatives were sedatives. And the only reason I'm trying to research this topic is because I'm desperate to fix my sleep, which would fix other debilitating symptoms. I just wanna know what the hell this all means, and I would like to revert my nervous system to how it was before.

The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song. You wrap your hands around the mug, and a gentle warmth spreads through your fingers, chasing away the chill. You lift it, and the rich aroma of coffee envelops you. You take the first sip.

The website was clean, the products were fire (or so I thought), and I was ready for the money to roll in.

My conversion rate was sitting at a solid, soul-crushing 0.8%. People were adding to cart and then ghosting me harder than a Tinder match from 2016. I was convinced it was my prices, my shipping, aliens—anything but my photos.

I mean, my photos were fine. I’d grabbed them straight from AliExpress. You know the ones: the super bright, white background shots where the product looks so perfect it’s basically a CGI render. I thought, ""Hey, it shows the product clearly, what's the problem?""

The problem was, my store looked like every other cookie-cutter, fly-by-night dropship operation. It had zero soul. Zero reality.

The wake-up call was brutal. I stumbled onto a competitor's site selling the exact same junk I was, but their stuff was selling out. The difference? Their photos looked… real. They had pics of the product on an actual desk, with coffee mug stains in the background. They had videos of someone unboxing it, fumbling with the packaging. They had user-generated content that was slightly blurry. It felt human. My store felt like a vending machine.

So, I swallowed my pride and my tiny profits, and I ordered my own products. When they arrived, I didn't set up a professional studio. I just used my phone.

I took pics of the thing on my kitchen counter. I shot a video of me using it next to my laptop with a dozen tabs open. I gave a few to my friends and said, ""Hey, just take a pic of it in your room and tell me what you honestly think.""

The result wasn't a pristine, ""professional"" gallery. It was messy. It was authentic. And it was a total game-changer.

Suddenly, my reviews weren't just 5-star generic junk. They were like, ""Love this! It fits perfectly next to my plant,"" with a slightly off-center photo. That little bit of realness built more trust than a thousand ""verified buyer"" tags ever could.

My conversion rate didn't just ""improve""—it finally had a pulse.

What I learnt is that; Your customers aren't buying a product; they're buying the idea of that product in their life. And a sterile, fake-looking photo doesn't sell that idea. A real, slightly imperfect one does.

I’ve been building this project for a while and finally decided to make it public. It’s completely free to use, no paywall or subscription — just something I wanted to share with the community.

\-----------------------------------

The main features in this software are taken from the research results of: perplexity, chat gpt, and gemini,...

My idea is to help new users of suno easier in making music when they sometimes have the wrong rhythm, sometimes the wrong instrument. The features of the starter mode are almost default as suggested. In the studio mode, you can choose a variety of instruments, rhythms, and tempos.

I am not a master of music production, so I hope the **COMMUNITY DEVELOPS THE APP WITH ME by sending me some comments to upgrade in the next version.**

\-------------------------------------

**TO GET THE APP,** [FIND ME HERE](https://ai.studio/apps/drive/1IAOfqwYQxFpj7Si0n5GE079GJNB4ujus)

**To use the app, you must have a google account.**

\-------------------------------------

# ✨ Main Features

* **Auto Prompt:** Uses AI to automatically generate prompts based on the context or style you need. 🤖
* **Auto Lyric:** Allows the app to automatically generate lyrics based on a specific scenario or context. ✍️

# 🚀 2 Basic Modes

1. **Starter Mode:** Great for getting going! You pick the **Music Genre**, and it provides suggestions for **tempo, rhythm**, and more.
2. **Studio Mode:** Dive deeper! This mode gives you more detailed suggestions, broken down **by each instrument** (like piano, guitar, drums, etc.). 🎸🎹

If you find it useful and want to help me keep improving it (bug fixes, new features, maybe even a mobile version), you can buy me a coffee or drop a small donation here: \[[https://ko-fi.com/vietfuturus\]](https://ko-fi.com/vietfuturus]). Totally optional, but it really helps keep the project alive.

I joined the gym around 20 days back and have been trying different workouts for all muscle groups,  just getting a feel of everything before following a fixed routine.

Now I’ve got a small doubt about supplements.
I keep hearing about protein powder and pre-workout but I’m not sure when exactly to take them or if they’re even necessary for someone like me who’s still new.

Can anyone explain it in a simple way? Like 

Should protein be taken right after workout or anytime during the day?

Is pre-workout really needed or can I just use coffee before gym?

After a few days here, we’re seriously packing our bags and saying goodbye to San Francisco!

We got to surf, hit a golf course, and walk for miles around town  and honestly, it already feels like home. Everyone we met was so welcoming (a few even shared their numbers to help us find a place to stay).

I wanted to tap into this sub for any local advice especially about the rental market and dog-friendly areas. We have two pups (a Shepsky and a Lab mix) who are our top priority. We’d love any insight into dog-friendly neighborhoods, parks, or trails where they can join us for more “human” adventures.

A few questions we’d love to hear from locals about:
	•	How competitive is the rental market right now? Are there certain areas that are easier (or harder) to find good rentals in?
	•	Any neighborhoods you’d recommend for young couples who love being active, outdoorsy, and near the beach but still want some walkable spots for food and coffee?

	•	Best dog parks, off-leash beaches, or trails you swear by?
	• if you were formerly from Northern California yourself, anything you wish you’d known before settling in?

For reference, SF’s rental market moves fast units are gone within days. Is it similar here?

I wanted to share the final total for this weekend's [Extra Life](https://www.extra-life.org/participants/549319) charity 24h marathon that I ran over on Twitch.

We raised $10,600 USD for the Stollery Children's Hospital in 24 hours. $5000 was raised in the first 4 hours.

With the EVE community's help, we raised over 750 **billion** isk in skins, ships, PLEX, ISK, modules and a host of other goodies [all of which can be tracked on this publicly available Google Spreadsheet.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10krCQzfDWHhaMDv4FSEaHwSEvMSkRuwLDItNDvCzUfs/edit) I am happy to say that every last penny was contracted to their winners this year, with many new bros having a plethora of isk and PLEX to spend whilly-nilly on the [Catalyst Expansion](https://www.eveonline.com/news/view/catalyst-expansion-launches-18-november) coming next week!

I wanted to thank a bunch of groups/people who made this weekend a huge success:

CCP for promoting the charity event in their [Twitter](https://x.com/EveOnline/status/1987247777613525112), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/DQwI3emD4lN/?hl=en) and to the CCP Members for showing up in-game to show their support.

Ahbazon Prime and friends for spending hundreds of billions of isk and dozens of hours of their personal time hauling dreads, making in-game connections and organizing for the [largest dread brawl](https://br.evetools.org/br/690fa2b706d75600125bff49) I have ever been a part of. 

[https://youtu.be/DNqtcd7Mvqk](https://youtu.be/DNqtcd7Mvqk)

All of the donors, big and small, who used their in-game time and assets to make this event a roaring success. Especially to all of the Platinum donors who gave between 25b to 100b (Squizz you son of a gun).

\-Sigma Grindset (25b)

\-Void1234 (25.4b)

\- ArcDemonX (26.7b)

\- Bob's Burgers (76b)

\- Chas Ramidan (50b)

\- EC Trade (50b)

\- Space Madness (51.7b) (thank you for the coffee!!!!!)

\- Soldier (52.3b)

\- EVE University (53.3b)

\- Tyaggy and WiNGSPAN (64b)

\- Squizz and Zkill (100b)

My moderator team Xylr, Bob, Farfnarkle, Nutters and everyone else for helping with giveaways and for keeping me going during the rough patches.

And most importantly of all, you, the donors. As Xylr eloquently said last year: ""Thank you. Thank you for all you do. Thank you for being a caring person and donating your time, money, digital pixels to Schad's charity event. Please take a second and pat yourselves on the back. You guys carried this 24hr stream, you guys are the reason we're able to help young children get the care they need. **You have a direct effect on a child's life.** I'm sure Schad would agree with me, but we can't thank you enough for your generosity, kindness and compassion. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.""

I understand that we may have our differences in the community, but there is no community quite like what we have. You are all wonderful and I am so thankful to have met every single one of you.

I'm sure a lot of people can relate... I'm finding equity crowdfunding is like an onion. Every time I think I've got it figured out, I peel a layer... and another... and another... and I figure that an agency is probably the way to go, especially for my first one.

One group that was recommended to me is Mav⁤erick Brands, which is run by Scott Hansen. They worked with Island beer, Proud Mary coffee, and NineLine apparel.

Before moving forward, I wanted to tap into this community (which has been super helpful as we’ve been learning the ropes) to see if anyone here has worked with Scott Hansen or Mav⁤erick Brands. How was your experience? Any insight would be much appreciated before we pull the trigger.

I'm also wondering how important it is to work with crowdfunding agencies that specialize in your specific category?

I shed for 2 years straight and my hair looks awful now, even though I had consistent regrowth. 

It was a struggle to get my ferritin up. I supplemented at a high dose for 6 months only for my levels to remain exactly the same. My dietician suggested I take the iron supplements with Lactoferrin. This helped my levels jump 40 points in about 3 months. Then I retested again 3 months later to see my ferritin had dropped by 10 points again despite still taking supplements (albeit with slightly less regularity). 

I really buckled down, continued to take the supplements and eat more meat. I finally noticed my hair shedding less about a month ago but I put it down to some other things I started doing (scalp massages, new serum, etc.). I retested my levels again, and was shocked to see my ferritin had jumped from 69 to 125 from the end of September to now. 

I am going to continue trying to incorporate iron in my diet (being careful not to consume coffee, tea or dairy alongside it) and potentially continue supplementing at least once a week to maintain because it's likely my levels are prone to dropping due to a few chronic conditions I have.

To be transparent, this year I have incorporated SEVERAL lifestyle changes that have all probably accumulated and helped this; however, I do think that finally elevating my ferritin and keeping it high is what finally gave my body the chance to start supporting my hair again.

1otgcm3,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1otgcm3/the_romsey_slasher/,The Romsey Slasher,"It was that time of year again when the leaves were dying and bringing the crowds of people who were from out of town. Romsey is a small, isolated town, and their annual fall festival is the highlight of the year. This year, a dark force lurked in the background. It was plotting and calculating the moves it would make, knowing exactly who its victims would be.

With a mask fitted to their face, they blended in with the cheerful crowds. Laughter drowned the unease, though as night fell, the first victim was found. They took pride in grotesquely displaying their kill like a trophy in the town square. The people of the town began to panic; rumors spread like wildfire. The killer knew that they were afraid and laughed at the feeble attempts to figure out who they were.

Can the townspeople uncover who the masked slasher is?

Or will they become part of the gruesome display in the town square…

Harvey pulled his jacket around himself to shield himself from the cold as he made his way down the driveway of his family home. It had been a while since he had been back in his hometown of Romsey. Harvey wouldn’t have come back if his father hadn’t fallen and hurt his back. When he first received the call, he was thinking the worst, but upon hearing the man’s voice on the other end, he exhaled a sigh of relief. So, Harvey took emergency leave from work to go take care of his father until he got better.

Right now, he was making his way to the local diner down the road to grab some breakfast for himself and his father. Neither one of them was as good of a cook as his late mother, but they cooked what was easy in order to survive. Plus, it had been some time since Harvey had a taste of Julie’s Diner. Walking down the sidewalk, he stopped at the crosswalk, waiting for the light, and went across. The parking lot was semi-packed since it wasn’t the morning rush, pulling open the door, the bell jingled, alerting his presence.

“Well, if it ain’t Thomas’s boy. How have you been, Harvey? Are you dining in or placing a to-go order?” an older woman with a high-top bun on her head greeted with a smile.

“Good to see you too, Julie. A to-go order, please.” Harvey sat down at the island bar and picked up a menu, glossing it over. Julie had been running this place since he was in diapers. Taking over from her father, who passed it down to her after his passing. It hit the town hard when Pop’s, Michael Ringer, died of a heart attack. Julie and her mother ran the diner until she had to place her into a retirement home.

The day he left Romsey was when Harvey heard that Julie lost her mom too.

Placing his order, he looked over at the mounted TV on the wall while he waited. Listening to the local news report detailing a body that had been found in Champions Square. A murder in a town like Romsey? Harvey thought to himself, quirking an eyebrow. It had to be the most surprising news ever since… when the Durlin Bridge went out during a heavy rainstorm. “Hard to believe, isn’t it?” said Julie, her voice low. 

“Yeah, it’s quite a surprise.” Harvey agreed. He was starting to think that someone had gotten bored of the peace and quiet Romsey offered. Or they had some sort of grudge against the people here. The order was done, and Julie packed it up for him. Harvey paid the tab and made his way out the door.

Harvey bumped shoulders with someone on the way out and muttered an excuse me before continuing on his way. The stranger watched him leave, studying him inquisitively as if he didn’t expect him to be here in town. Harvey didn’t think much of it as he was used to tourists coming into town. He got home and set up the kitchen for dinner. “Pops, I’m back!” Harvey hollered, setting the takeout on the counter to get down some plates and coffee cups.

They ate breakfast in silence other than the usual small talk. Harvey mentioned what he had heard on the news at Julie’s. His father shook his head, saying that it sounded like a copycat. “What do you mean a copycat?” Harvey asked. “When I was a teenager. If I recall, there was a situation like that. Where people who got near the local park mysteriously ended up dead.” His father replied, taking a sip of his coffee.

Harvey pressed a little further, questioning if they ever caught who did it. His father just shrugged, sipping his coffee. He said that the trail was cold, that whoever did it was good at covering their tracks. What didn’t make sense to Harvey was why this copycat was showing up now, years later? Did they get bored and decide that killing a few people would be good amusement?

Whatever the reason, he had to make sure that his was safe. Since the killer didn’t really have a type of person they were after. Anyone could be a target who entered Champions town square. Should he do a stake-out and see if he could spot someone out of place? Harvey shook his head mentally, kicking himself for thinking something so dangerous.

Cleaning up the kitchen, he washed their dishes as his father retired to the living room. The sound of TV being turned on could be heard in the background. Harvey looked out the window, watching as cars drove by and neighbors walked down the sidewalk. They were on their way to the corner store or taking the family pet on a walk. He felt deep down that Romsey would never be the same, and that this first murder was just the start.

The following morning, Harvey took his father to his doctor’s appointment. Halfway to their destination, there was a traffic stop set up. His father mumbled under his breath about how ridiculous this all was. Harvey had disagreed, however, because this killer seemed to have struck again. Just who had this person chosen as their victim this time?

Harvey rolled his window down to talk to the officer who instructed them to stop. He began fishing his ID and registration out of his wallet. Handing it over along with his father’s, the officer looked it over, eyeing Harvey with suspicion. “Is this your son, Thomas?” the officer asked. “Yeah, this is Harvey. Last time you saw him, he was knee-high.” Thomas laughed.

The officer nodded, handing back over the IDs and registration. “Be careful at night if you have to go out,” he warned. Then, he motioned for them to go ahead and move forward. Driving past the town square, where they were busy cleaning up the mess, Harvey glanced over. To his horror, the person being loaded onto the gurney was Julie Ringer. He had just seen her yesterday… was the killer just choosing whoever they felt deserved to die?

Harvey hoped that his father hadn’t seen what he had. It would have quite the impact on him, considering he had known each other for a long time. The appointment went well, with his father being told that the next step would be physical therapy. Thomas was healing as he should and without complications. At least his father wouldn’t need any surgery on his knee.

Later that night, Thomas had gotten a call from some of Julie’s family to break the news to him. Harvey had been the one to answer it, confirming what he had seen earlier. “Who was that on the phone?” Thomas questioned from his recliner in the living room. “That was some of Julie’s family…. they uh found her body this morning in Champions Square.” Harvey cleared his throat, making his way back to the living room head down.

Thomas paled, turning his head to look back at the TV, tears pricking at the edges of his eyes. “Harvey, have a seat. I need to tell you about what happened back in 1978,” said his father, motioning to the couch. His father muted the tv and rubbed his sore knee and began to tell his story. When he was about eighteen, there had been a string of murders that happened in Emerald Park. The police didn’t have any leads, and since there wasn’t any evidence left behind.

The killer would put the deceased into a sitting position; hands folded in their lap and eyes closed. As if they were taking a nap and would be waking up any time. Probably reveling in all of the reactions they were getting when people realized that the person they were trying to wake up was dead. First it was Thomas’s older sister, and then Julie’s mother a month later. The killer was calculated, never picking similar victims with each kill and never more than one victim at a time.

Those murders went unsolved, and after a year, they just stopped. Now something similar was happening again. Except this copycat was killing more than one person and changing the location. Even the position of the bodies was arranged in an unusual way compared to the previous killer. Flat on their back, legs together, and hands over their closed eyes.

Not even a speck of blood anywhere. For the longest time, they thought it had to be someone with medical knowledge. Because when they examined the bodies, all of the blood had been drained. Not a single scar left behind to indicate where the blood had been taken from. For the longest time, people swore whoever it was must be a vampire, a cultist, or a black-market dealer.

Honestly, it didn’t matter how many theories they tossed around; it didn’t help with the fact that people were being killed. Thomas continued explaining that he once stayed up late at night watching the park. Waiting to see if he could spot who had been bringing the bodies into Emerald Park and setting them up. He was about to call it quits and go home when he saw it. A tall figure was walking through the early morning fog, carrying a body in their arm.

Their complexion was warm sepia, reddish-brown. Tawny eyes with gold blending through the brown. When Thomas saw them, they had an eerie glow to them. The figure sat the latest victim up on the bench, placing their hands in their lap. They had said something, but it was in a language he didn’t know.

“Do you remember what they said?” Harvey asked.

Thomas furrowed his brow “Che il tuo sacrificio non sia vano.” he replied.

Harvey leaned back, slumping into the couch. It was Italian for “ may your sacrifice not be in vain.” At least, he was sure. Did it have to do with the blood? Or had other things been taken out of the bodies as well? According to his father, there were no surgical scars when the medical examiner had looked at the bodies.

There was something that was being overlooked. Tomorrow, he would see if he couldn’t get into the morgue to see someone. Harvey had a gut feeling that something was being overlooked. He desperately wanted to get down to the bottom of it. For his father and all of the other past victims who were hard by this.

Morning soon came, and he felt as if he hadn’t slept at all. Going into the small hospital, Romsey had Harvey make the excuse that he was there to ID a body. He didn’t know if any deceased had come in unclaimed, but he was willing to take a shot. The receptionist took a moment and nodded, confirming that there was one unclaimed body. She then instructed him where to go from the reception desk, and he nervously boarded an old, rickety elevator.

As the elevator descended down into the morgue, the lights slightly flickered. Chills made their way down Harvey’s spine. This was beginning to feel like a bad horror movie. The doors creaked open, and he stepped out, making his way down a singular hallway to a set of double doors. There before him was a motionless body underneath a white sheet.

Looking around, he didn’t see anyone around, so he reached out and pulled the sheet down. The face that looked back at him looked familiar to him. Harvey hadn’t seen this person before, but the description of them flooded into his mind. The warm sepia, reddish-brown complexation, and tawny eyes with gold blending through the brown. This had to be him, the man that his father told him about the… Romsey Slasher.

Harvey took a step back as the man rose up off the table and began walking towards him. As he backed away, he could feel the door dig into his back. All he had to do was grab the knob and turn it. The man reached out his hand, a hole opening in his palm, and an inky black tentacle slithered out. Harvey let out a gasp, and the tentacle saw its chance, diving down his throat with a sickening gurgle.

Thomas was on his second cup of coffee this morning. Since he hadn’t been able to sleep the previous night, Harvey didn’t come home last night, and Thomas was worried that something had happened to him. Making his way to the living room, he turned on the tv and flipped through the channels. Thomas only stopped when a news flash appeared on the screen.

The new reporter described a young man in his thirties and noted him as a local to the town. When they showed a picture of Harvey, he dropped his coffee cup. It shattered on the ground, spilling its contents mixing with porcelain. Thomas didn’t want to believe it; he didn’t want to believe that his only child had been taken away just like his older sister back then. Thomas gripped the armrests as anger surged through him, fighting back the tears that threatened to spill over.

Was there really no stopping the Romsey slasher?",1,1762787605.0,libraryofshadows,0,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

I've been lurking around here for a few weeks now, looking to begin my journey into proper coffee making. I really want to do espresso but on a daily basis I like having longer, filter/V60 type coffees at my desk.

As for beans, I am exploring and will definitely try all types of roasts. I think I will gravitate towars lighter/medium roasts but cannot say for sure yet.

I've looked at tons of posts and videos.

Here is what I am thinking of buying :

* Cafelat Robot for espresso. 
   * Just seems like an incredible quality for the price, I want something with little maintenance and parts. Will take care of the espresso needs.
* A nice gooseneck kettle, something similar to a Fellow Stagg EKG but cheaper.

Now for the grinder, I initially thought of a budget around 300€ and the DF54 seemed great. Recommended a lot. But I kept looking and stumbled upon the Option-O Lagom Casa and thought ""wow I need this grinder"".

Looks are important to me, as it will sit on my counter all the time. On top of that, the quality of the Casa seems great, minimal to no retention, great coffee (especially for light roasts apparently?)...

**This is my option number 1.** For a delivery all inclusive to europe, that is 616$ or 532€ as of right now.

The only negatives I can see are :

* waiting for dispatch, they have a Early December dispatch planned but I am not sure until when the orders will be valid for this one, to avoid waiting weeks for another dispatch... Meanwhile I want to wait a little and see if they have any blackfriday pricing :( 
* burr size that seems to lock you into their ecosystem?

I looked at a lot of other grinders but one in particular peeked my interest : The F74 Navigator.

It's way more expensive at the base price but tomorrow is a big reduction planned on aliexpress, and there are content creator codes around. I'm confident I can find it for around 700$ - 600€ if I wait a bit.

It looks great, from what I read here people are pleased by it, but there are less reviews and most reviews on youtube have a discount code, which means it's probably partnered...

It seems like a very solid option as well.

**TL;DR:**

Lagom Casa or F74 Navigator for first grinder suitable for espresso and filter/V60? Or something else around this budget?

Main needs : 

* great taste, ideally versatile
* low maintenance required
* minimal retention and minimal static to reduce cleaning needs
* good workflow to switch grind sizes

https://www.slashfilm.com/2014688/leonard-nimoy-feud-gene-roddenberry-killed-major-anniversary-book-project/

By Witney Seibold:

""It was a massive book, priced at $45.00, and it was to feature extensive interviews with all the ""Star Trek"" and ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" cast members, as well as a slew of new illustrations by artist Richard Arnold.

But the book was never actually published, and Leonard Nimoy was directly responsible. According to Sackett's book, Nimoy was one of the last actors to sign off on photos of Spock that were to be used in the book, and only then began to read the text. Nimoy disapproved of the text, it seems, an objection that came from a closed-door meeting between Nimoy, Nimoy's lawyer, Roddenberry, and Roddenberry's lawyer, Leonard Maizlish. It seems that the book was too commercially coded for Nimoy, and that he would have preferred more highfalutin language that stressed the cultural importance of ""Star Trek."" As Sackett wrote: 

>""The book was on hold because Leonard Nimoy didn't think the prose 'lofty enough,' as Maizlish put it, and wanted it more in the style of someone like Bill Moyers.""

Moyers was the co-author of the invaluable 1988 tome ""The Power of Myth,"" alongside Joseph Campbell.""

Nimoy, [...] wasn't getting along with Roddenberry too well in 1991, adding a lot of animosity to the above closed-door meeting. Sackett had once heard a Desilu executive relate that Nimoy hated Roddenberry for his self-aggrandizement habits, and that he didn't like how much credit Roddenberry took for himself. Nimoy refused to sign off on the text of the 25th anniversary book, something that was included in his contract, and he singlehandedly forced the book to be shelved. A lot of the manuscript was eventually repurposed for a 1994 book called ""Star Trek: Where No One Has Gone Before – A History in Pictures."" Sackett's name does not appear on the cover of that book. 

Nimoy's cancelation of the book was well-known to fans thanks to a 1992 article in ""Cinefantastique"" magazine. That issue explained merely that Nimoy had vetoed the book because he hadn't been consulted, and that Pocket Books placed it on indefinite hold. [...]""

A stranger in the building across the street tried to warn me about an intruder. That's not what happened.,"It's 3:17 AM. That's what the glowing numbers on my phone say. I’m on the third floor of a massive, empty warehouse in the middle of the city. 

My job is simple: walk the route, hit the sensor pads, and try not to fall asleep.

The third floor is the worst. It’s a vast, cavernous space filled with towering metal racks, most of them empty. The lights are on, but they're so high up they just create this sick, humming, yellow gloom. The only other light comes from the wall of grime-caked windows looking out over the alley.

I’m drinking stale coffee from my thermos when I look out the window. Across the alley is another tall building. It’s derelict, one of those abandoned office high-rises the city forgot about. All dark, broken windows.

I’m staring into the void when I see it.

A light. A single, tiny pinprick of light, deep inside one of the windows on the tenth floor. It flashes. Then flashes again.

I freeze, my mug halfway to my mouth. It’s probably just kids.

I watch, and the light flashes again.

Dot. Dot. Dot. 

Then a pause. 

Dot. Dot. Dot.

""S.O.S."" I whisper, a cold laugh catching in my throat. ""Real funny.""

I move away from the window and continue my patrol. The sound of my own footsteps on the concrete is deafeningly loud. I check the fire exit. Locked. I check the freight elevator. Locked. Everything is secure.

The patrol takes me in a huge loop, and after thirty minutes, I’m back at the windows. I can't help myself. I look.

The light is gone.

In its place, someone is holding something up in the window. It’s a large piece of cardboard, with crude letters painted in what looks like white.

I have to squint to read it.

""BEHIND YOU.""

My blood turns to ice. Every hair on my body stands on end. It’s the most primal, lizard-brain fear you can imagine.

I spin around, yanking the heavy Maglite from my belt. The beam cuts through the yellow haze.

""Who's there!"" I yell. My voice cracks.

Nothing.

Just endless rows of empty shelves. The hum of the lights. The distant sound of a siren, miles away.

I let out a shaky breath. It's a prank by some squatter with a good vantage point. I’m furious, and my heart is hammering so hard it hurts. I turn back to the window, ready to flip them off.

There's a new sign.

""NOT JOKE. ON CATWALK. STAY STILL.""

I don't want to. God, I don't want to. But I look up.

Running the entire length of the warehouse, maybe forty feet above my head, is a rusty metal maintenance catwalk. I've never been up there. I shine my light up, sweeping the beam across the grating.

Nothing. Just pipes and shadows.

I turn back to the window, ready to yell.

New sign.

""HE IS WATCHING YOU. I CALLED POLICE.""

I am completely, totally frozen. My feet are lead. I can't move. I can't breathe. I'm just staring at that sign, at the dark figure holding it in that dark window.

My radio crackles to life, so loud it makes me jump.

""Unit 4, this is Dispatch. We have a 911 call reporting a 10-31 at your location. Caller states they have visual on an intruder. Can you confirm?""

I can't answer. I’m paralyzed, my eyes locked on the window.

And then I hear it.

A sound that doesn't belong. A single, soft scrape of a boot on metal. From the catwalk. Above me.

He's real. He's up there.

The sign in the window disappears. A second later, a new one appears.

""LADDER. FAR WALL. HE'S COMING DOWN.""

That breaks the spell. I run.

I don't even know where I'm going, just away from the far wall. I sprint past the racks, heading for the freight elevator. I slam the button, my thumb pounding the metal. I can hear the sirens now, getting closer.

I look back.

At the far end of the aisle, a tall, thin figure is silhouetted against the loading bay doors. He's just standing there. Watching me.

The elevator dings and the heavy metal gate screeches open. I dive in, stabbing the button for the lobby. The gate begins to rattle shut.

The man starts walking toward me. Not running. Just a slow, steady walk.

The gate closes, and I collapse against the wall, gasping for air. I'm safe.

The elevator shudders, and the doors open to the bright lobby. Two cops are there, guns drawn. My boss, Jerry, is right behind them.

""Mark! Thank God! Are you okay?"" Jerry yells.

""Upstairs,"" I gasp, pointing. ""Third floor. He was on the catwalk. The guy across the street saw him! He was holding up signs!""

The cops look at each other. One of them lowers his weapon. ""Son, we've already cleared the building with the K-9 unit. There is nobody up there.""

""What? No! I saw him! And the guy in the window! He warned me!""

Jerry puts his hand on my shoulder, his face pale. ""Mark, what guy in the window?""

""In the building across the alley! The abandoned one!""

The older cop sighs. ""Sir, the building across the alley isn't abandoned. It's the city's primary data-storage annex. It's been active for ten years. It’s a high-security facility.""

He pauses, and this is the part I can't get out of my head.

""There are no windows.""

I turn and look out the lobby's glass doors. Across the alley is a sheer, monolithic block of polished black granite. Not a single window. 

""But... I saw...""

""We also checked the logs, Mark,"" the other cop says, his voice soft. ""The freight elevator? The motor's been burned out since Tuesday. It hasn't moved in four days.""

I look at the elevator I just stepped out of. The yellow ""OUT OF ORDER"" sign is still taped to the gate.

""But... the 911 call,"" I whispered. ""Dispatch got a call.""

The older cop nods, his eyes filled with something I can only describe as pity. ""We did. We traced the call. It wasn't from a stranger.""

He points up at the ceiling.

1otgbfg,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1otgbfg/the_romsey_slasher/,The Romsey Slasher,"It was that time of year again when the leaves were dying and bringing the crowds of people who were from out of town. Romsey is a small, isolated town, and their annual fall festival is the highlight of the year. This year, a dark force lurked in the background. It was plotting and calculating the moves it would make, knowing exactly who its victims would be.

With a mask fitted to their face, they blended in with the cheerful crowds. Laughter drowned the unease, though as night fell, the first victim was found. They took pride in grotesquely displaying their kill like a trophy in the town square. The people of the town began to panic; rumors spread like wildfire. The killer knew that they were afraid and laughed at the feeble attempts to figure out who they were.

Can the townspeople uncover who the masked slasher is?

Or will they become part of the gruesome display in the town square…

Harvey pulled his jacket around himself to shield himself from the cold as he made his way down the driveway of his family home. It had been a while since he had been back in his hometown of Romsey. Harvey wouldn’t have come back if his father hadn’t fallen and hurt his back. When he first received the call, he was thinking the worst, but upon hearing the man’s voice on the other end, he exhaled a sigh of relief. So, Harvey took emergency leave from work to go take care of his father until he got better.

Right now, he was making his way to the local diner down the road to grab some breakfast for himself and his father. Neither one of them was as good of a cook as his late mother, but they cooked what was easy in order to survive. Plus, it had been some time since Harvey had a taste of Julie’s Diner. Walking down the sidewalk, he stopped at the crosswalk, waiting for the light, and went across. The parking lot was semi-packed since it wasn’t the morning rush, pulling open the door, the bell jingled, alerting his presence.

“Well, if it ain’t Thomas’s boy. How have you been, Harvey? Are you dining in or placing a to-go order?” an older woman with a high-top bun on her head greeted with a smile.

“Good to see you too, Julie. A to-go order, please.” Harvey sat down at the island bar and picked up a menu, glossing it over. Julie had been running this place since he was in diapers. Taking over from her father, who passed it down to her after his passing. It hit the town hard when Pop’s, Michael Ringer, died of a heart attack. Julie and her mother ran the diner until she had to place her into a retirement home.

The day he left Romsey was when Harvey heard that Julie lost her mom too.

Placing his order, he looked over at the mounted TV on the wall while he waited. Listening to the local news report detailing a body that had been found in Champions Square. A murder in a town like Romsey? Harvey thought to himself, quirking an eyebrow. It had to be the most surprising news ever since… when the Durlin Bridge went out during a heavy rainstorm. “Hard to believe, isn’t it?” said Julie, her voice low. 

“Yeah, it’s quite a surprise.” Harvey agreed. He was starting to think that someone had gotten bored of the peace and quiet Romsey offered. Or they had some sort of grudge against the people here. The order was done, and Julie packed it up for him. Harvey paid the tab and made his way out the door.

Harvey bumped shoulders with someone on the way out and muttered an excuse me before continuing on his way. The stranger watched him leave, studying him inquisitively as if he didn’t expect him to be here in town. Harvey didn’t think much of it as he was used to tourists coming into town. He got home and set up the kitchen for dinner. “Pops, I’m back!” Harvey hollered, setting the takeout on the counter to get down some plates and coffee cups.

They ate breakfast in silence other than the usual small talk. Harvey mentioned what he had heard on the news at Julie’s. His father shook his head, saying that it sounded like a copycat. “What do you mean a copycat?” Harvey asked. “When I was a teenager. If I recall, there was a situation like that. Where people who got near the local park mysteriously ended up dead.” His father replied, taking a sip of his coffee.

Harvey pressed a little further, questioning if they ever caught who did it. His father just shrugged, sipping his coffee. He said that the trail was cold, that whoever did it was good at covering their tracks. What didn’t make sense to Harvey was why this copycat was showing up now, years later? Did they get bored and decide that killing a few people would be good amusement?

Whatever the reason, he had to make sure that his was safe. Since the killer didn’t really have a type of person they were after. Anyone could be a target who entered Champions town square. Should he do a stake-out and see if he could spot someone out of place? Harvey shook his head mentally, kicking himself for thinking something so dangerous.

Cleaning up the kitchen, he washed their dishes as his father retired to the living room. The sound of TV being turned on could be heard in the background. Harvey looked out the window, watching as cars drove by and neighbors walked down the sidewalk. They were on their way to the corner store or taking the family pet on a walk. He felt deep down that Romsey would never be the same, and that this first murder was just the start.

The following morning, Harvey took his father to his doctor’s appointment. Halfway to their destination, there was a traffic stop set up. His father mumbled under his breath about how ridiculous this all was. Harvey had disagreed, however, because this killer seemed to have struck again. Just who had this person chosen as their victim this time?

Harvey rolled his window down to talk to the officer who instructed them to stop. He began fishing his ID and registration out of his wallet. Handing it over along with his father’s, the officer looked it over, eyeing Harvey with suspicion. “Is this your son, Thomas?” the officer asked. “Yeah, this is Harvey. Last time you saw him, he was knee-high.” Thomas laughed.

The officer nodded, handing back over the IDs and registration. “Be careful at night if you have to go out,” he warned. Then, he motioned for them to go ahead and move forward. Driving past the town square, where they were busy cleaning up the mess, Harvey glanced over. To his horror, the person being loaded onto the gurney was Julie Ringer. He had just seen her yesterday… was the killer just choosing whoever they felt deserved to die?

Harvey hoped that his father hadn’t seen what he had. It would have quite the impact on him, considering he had known each other for a long time. The appointment went well, with his father being told that the next step would be physical therapy. Thomas was healing as he should and without complications. At least his father wouldn’t need any surgery on his knee.

Later that night, Thomas had gotten a call from some of Julie’s family to break the news to him. Harvey had been the one to answer it, confirming what he had seen earlier. “Who was that on the phone?” Thomas questioned from his recliner in the living room. “That was some of Julie’s family…. they uh found her body this morning in Champions Square.” Harvey cleared his throat, making his way back to the living room head down.

Thomas paled, turning his head to look back at the TV, tears pricking at the edges of his eyes. “Harvey, have a seat. I need to tell you about what happened back in 1978,” said his father, motioning to the couch. His father muted the tv and rubbed his sore knee and began to tell his story. When he was about eighteen, there had been a string of murders that happened in Emerald Park. The police didn’t have any leads, and since there wasn’t any evidence left behind.

The killer would put the deceased into a sitting position; hands folded in their lap and eyes closed. As if they were taking a nap and would be waking up any time. Probably reveling in all of the reactions they were getting when people realized that the person they were trying to wake up was dead. First it was Thomas’s older sister, and then Julie’s mother a month later. The killer was calculated, never picking similar victims with each kill and never more than one victim at a time.

Those murders went unsolved, and after a year, they just stopped. Now something similar was happening again. Except this copycat was killing more than one person and changing the location. Even the position of the bodies was arranged in an unusual way compared to the previous killer. Flat on their back, legs together, and hands over their closed eyes.

Not even a speck of blood anywhere. For the longest time, they thought it had to be someone with medical knowledge. Because when they examined the bodies, all of the blood had been drained. Not a single scar left behind to indicate where the blood had been taken from. For the longest time, people swore whoever it was must be a vampire, a cultist, or a black-market dealer.

Honestly, it didn’t matter how many theories they tossed around; it didn’t help with the fact that people were being killed. Thomas continued explaining that he once stayed up late at night watching the park. Waiting to see if he could spot who had been bringing the bodies into Emerald Park and setting them up. He was about to call it quits and go home when he saw it. A tall figure was walking through the early morning fog, carrying a body in their arm.

Their complexion was warm sepia, reddish-brown. Tawny eyes with gold blending through the brown. When Thomas saw them, they had an eerie glow to them. The figure sat the latest victim up on the bench, placing their hands in their lap. They had said something, but it was in a language he didn’t know.

“Do you remember what they said?” Harvey asked.

Thomas furrowed his brow “Che il tuo sacrificio non sia vano.” he replied.

Harvey leaned back, slumping into the couch. It was Italian for “ may your sacrifice not be in vain.” At least, he was sure. Did it have to do with the blood? Or had other things been taken out of the bodies as well? According to his father, there were no surgical scars when the medical examiner had looked at the bodies.

There was something that was being overlooked. Tomorrow, he would see if he couldn’t get into the morgue to see someone. Harvey had a gut feeling that something was being overlooked. He desperately wanted to get down to the bottom of it. For his father and all of the other past victims who were hard by this.

Morning soon came, and he felt as if he hadn’t slept at all. Going into the small hospital, Romsey had Harvey make the excuse that he was there to ID a body. He didn’t know if any deceased had come in unclaimed, but he was willing to take a shot. The receptionist took a moment and nodded, confirming that there was one unclaimed body. She then instructed him where to go from the reception desk, and he nervously boarded an old, rickety elevator.

As the elevator descended down into the morgue, the lights slightly flickered. Chills made their way down Harvey’s spine. This was beginning to feel like a bad horror movie. The doors creaked open, and he stepped out, making his way down a singular hallway to a set of double doors. There before him was a motionless body underneath a white sheet.

Looking around, he didn’t see anyone around, so he reached out and pulled the sheet down. The face that looked back at him looked familiar to him. Harvey hadn’t seen this person before, but the description of them flooded into his mind. The warm sepia, reddish-brown complexation, and tawny eyes with gold blending through the brown. This had to be him, the man that his father told him about the… Romsey Slasher.

Harvey took a step back as the man rose up off the table and began walking towards him. As he backed away, he could feel the door dig into his back. All he had to do was grab the knob and turn it. The man reached out his hand, a hole opening in his palm, and an inky black tentacle slithered out. Harvey let out a gasp, and the tentacle saw its chance, diving down his throat with a sickening gurgle.

Thomas was on his second cup of coffee this morning. Since he hadn’t been able to sleep the previous night, Harvey didn’t come home last night, and Thomas was worried that something had happened to him. Making his way to the living room, he turned on the tv and flipped through the channels. Thomas only stopped when a news flash appeared on the screen.

The new reporter described a young man in his thirties and noted him as a local to the town. When they showed a picture of Harvey, he dropped his coffee cup. It shattered on the ground, spilling its contents mixing with porcelain. Thomas didn’t want to believe it; he didn’t want to believe that his only child had been taken away just like his older sister back then. Thomas gripped the armrests as anger surged through him, fighting back the tears that threatened to spill over.

Was there really no stopping the Romsey slasher?",1,1762787531.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False
1otgag5,https://www.reddit.com/r/advanced_english/comments/1otgag5/wanna_sound_like_a_native_speaker/,Wanna Sound like a Native Speaker?,"Sounding more like a native speaker is not difficult, but requires practicing speaking in a way that differs from simply reading aloud from books. Many students sound ""more like a book than a real person"" because they are not used to hearing English sounds connected with the words they read.

The challenge in English is that native speakers do ""all sorts of strange things"" when they speak quickly:
They connect words (e.g., ""I get up"").
They use contractions (e.g., ""I will"" becomes ""I'll go"").
They add sounds, drop sounds, even change sounds when words come
together.
They leave out whole words (e.g., ""I'm going to the pub, are you coming"" might become ""I'm going to the pub, coming"").
The video helps learners hear and practice these common examples of natural spoken English that differ from the written words.

Key Reductions and Contractions to Practice
Common Questions and Phrases:
""Do you want a coffee"" often becomes ""do you wanna coffee"".
The more polite question ""Would you like a coffee"" is typically used by
waiters or when speaking to someone you don't know well.

The 'H' Drop in Questions:
When auxiliary verbs are used in questions with the pronoun he, the 'h' sound often disappears.
""Was he"" becomes ""wuzzy"" (e.g., ""Was he happy"").
""Has he"" becomes ""hazy"" (e.g., ""Has he called you"").
Contractions for Fluency (Wanna, Gonna, Shoulda):
The use of contractions like ""wanna"" (want to) and ""gonna"" (going to) is suitable for IELTS Speaking because it is a test of natural conversational English.
""I am going to go"" becomes ""I'm gonna go"". Crucially, the ""gonna"" already includes ""to,"" so you should not say ""I'm gonna to go"".
""I want to go"" becomes ""I wanna go"".
""Shall we go"" becomes ""should we go"". This is used as a suggestion.
To express regret in the past, ""I should have gone"" becomes ""I shoulda
gone"".

The Goal of Practice
The goal is not to sound like a ""perfect native English speaker"". That model is often impossible and unnecessary, leading to frustration. The purpose of
practicing these sounds is to improve your pronunciation and better control your pronunciation to get a higher score on IELTS speaking. The process should be fun, focusing on practice, not perfection.",1,1762787467.0,advanced_english,0,1.0,False

1otg7s5,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoldFarm/comments/1otg7s5/do_not_seek_after_ultimate_truth_because_here/,"do not seek after ultimate truth, because here that is","Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

We had a sports group in this weekend, they needed the meeting room for evenings dinner and getting together and getting loaded, (the parents), being such wonderful, responsible parents they set up a mini hockey net with mini hockey sticks so the kids could play hockey in the meeting room, now keep in mind this is a meeting room and not a sports arena, the walls are not meant to have flying objects bouncing off of them.

So last night I heard a lot of banging on the wall in the back office which sort of connects to the meeting room, as the kids are leaving I am seeing them walking out with actual golf clubs. So after everyone left I went in to inspect the room and low and behold, my back wall is damaged as is a large pillar, chipped paint, dents and dings, just freaking lovely.

Just as we wanted, it was supposed to be just a casual hookup. But of course, I liked him, I liked him physically, I was attracted to him, which is why I hooked up with him. He told me he felt the same. After that, I decided to delete my G app and be exclusive with him for safety reasons.

On our second meet, I slept over at his apartment. We talked about a lot of things, life, love, career, etc. It was a very wholesome experience and felt like it wasn’t just a hookup. We cuddled all night, and when we woke up, I went straight to the shower. After I got out, food and coffee were ready, and he even booked and paid for my ride to work. At that moment, I got confused. Was that just basic human decency, and I was just overthinking it?

As weeks went by, our communication didn’t stop. We would always talk about random things, funny memes, dirty jokes, my love life (he would even encourage and help me look for a boyfriend), and our work.

Then, on our third meet, I slept over at his apartment again. The same thing happened, fun and wholesome conversations, cuddling all night, eating dinner together. He was really accommodating. We would meet about once a month because his boyfriend stays at his apartment, so we only meet when we get the chance. There were also times I couldn’t go because of schedule conflicts.

Once, we were talking about hookups, and he told me he felt guilty because I was being exclusive with him, and he couldn’t do the same.

I have bad health anxiety. My boyfriend tells me not to remove, to change my mindset and to learn to live with pains and discomfort, meditate, eat healthy and work with anxiety. He even suggested me seeing someone who heals with energy. For him the discomfort is not anything that prevents you from living life to the fullest and my life got worse when my symptoms started, with bad anxiety preventing me from living normal life.

Symptoms for 6+ months. They come and go, varies, fluctuates, changes with time, some of them stayed. I have a bad health anxiety on top of that, so some of them may be related to this. 

**Symptoms:**
**• Spring/early Summer:** mild pinching and stabbing pains in the place my gallbladder is. Ribs sore to touch. Some episodes of mild billiary colic (cramping feeling in my right ribs, a little nauseous, pain like a band wrapping to my back, nagging, happens after big meal and in the evening, after the episodes I had cold sweats and feeling of general malaise, my belly was sore to touch).
**• From July:** after last attack the weird pain under my right shoulder blade stayed and doesn't go away. It feels worse after eating and during certain movements, is like muscoloskeletal, but it's not. Deeper, dull achy feeling rather in one certain spot, sometimes radiating to the ribs. Pain varies in intensity, sometimes is barely noticeable, the other days I feel it with every movement and the area under my bra line is sore to touch, the pain is somehow breathtaking, like something was pulling me from the inside or like something is bloated in there. From July I have frequent episodes of lighter stool, yellowish/orange.
**• Other symptoms:** sometimes mild nausea, sometimes bloating after heavy meals, weird taste in mouth, very slightly elevated direct bilirubin, sometimes dizziness (but Idk if it's anxiety symptom).

Ultrasound showed no inflammation apart from 5mm non-growing polyp and folded gallbladder (anatomic variant?), bloodwork showed nothing concerning apart from slightly elevated direct bilirubin. No HIDA in my country. 

I can eat pretty everything and experience no attacks, just dull irritating back ache, sometimes bloating when I eat too much of various or heavy foods, but nothing like you describe here. I don't eat heavy though. I like sweets and dairy, and it's the only one heavier thing I eat. But my symptoms are inconsistent. Once I ate deep fried chinese pasta with vegetables in oil and some crisps, and was nauseous and bloated. The next time I ate salmon with chips and drank coffee, and no symptoms.

I feel like I am anxious, overreacting and not sick enough to have my gallbladder removed (what if it gets worse after that). Maybe I should manage it with not eating anything heavy, dairy, sweets. I am afraid that post-op I won't be able to eat those thing anyway.

Not small talk or forced conversations, but someone I can genuinely connect with. Someone who’s there through the day, someone I can share thoughts with, and someone who feels like a steady presence.

I’m not in a rush for anything. I just want real conversations with someone who’s easy to talk to and naturally fits into my life. If it turns into something meaningful over time, good. If it becomes a solid friendship, that’s good too.

About me. I’m grounded, calm, and straightforward. I like people who think deeply and speak honestly. I’m spiritual in my own way, influenced by psychedelics and philosophies like stoicism. Coffee is basically my morning ritual, and most evenings I wind down with music or a good show. Lately I’ve been diving back into the things that actually make me feel centered.

I’m looking for someone who’s kind, thoughtful, and comfortable being themselves. Someone who can handle a mix of serious conversations and quiet teasing. Someone warm, nurturing, steady.

If you’ve been feeling the same kind of quiet or want someone you can actually talk to without pretending, say hi. Let’s see where it goes naturally.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

[https:\/\/pdxint.at\/4hPEdYx](https://preview.redd.it/w52rdx9kxf0g1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ad45add650db9fa56a2692106e4c1bd77f8cfd8c)

Hello everyone and Happy Monday! Systems Designer Tunay here to report that I’ve been let out of the mines to bring you some of our new modding related highlights for this update and we have some important points to go through so let’s not stall any further!

# Database Entry Modes

To begin with, this update will break your mods and I really want to make sure to emphasize that so I'd like to repeat myself here:

**THIS UPDATE WILL BREAK YOUR MODS** 

Now hold on I see those pitchforks that you are raising but let me explain myself for there is a good reason for all of this. Some of you might have looked at [Tinto Talks #85 - Modding](https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/tinto-talks-85-22nd-of-october-modding.1864004/) or, by the time you are reading this, have played and modded EU5 yourself!

One very significant change that was introduced to our scripting language in EU5 is the addition of **Database Entry Modes**. This feature enables you to govern how a piece of script in your mod will interact with a preexisting piece of script in either the main game or another mod through the usage of new **KEYWORDS**.

**We are bringing this feature to Victoria 3** as well with this upcoming update and you will have to adjust your mods accordingly to the new syntax that we are now forcing upon you!

For the uninitiated amongst you allow me to take you through this system with a couple examples from my new hit mod, the lovingly dubbed “*Victoria Tweaks Mod 2*”:

As my first change I would like to reframe and buff the Peasant Levies law to really represent the spirit and strength of the Rural Folk Interest Group. To that end I can use the *INJECT* keyword preceding the key of the law itself to insert script into the existing law. In this case we wish to adjust the modifier block of the law itself by making it slightly more balanced

[In script…](https://preview.redd.it/nenq2t7gwf0g1.png?width=697&format=png&auto=webp&s=968c521855efb07c3ca8f2f93f2dcac442b79fc5)

[…and in game](https://preview.redd.it/xjnyk01hwf0g1.png?width=552&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe86488d426d9411b54d9b2cd798457009198cf4)

With this change the “Doodlez’ Peasants Army” will be the unstoppable armed wing of the Rural Folk!

As some of you may have noted already, injecting modifiers into existing ones is handled additively so if you for example have a modifier that increases a country’s prestige by 25% in the main game and you inject the same modifiers again but at 50% it will sum up to 75%!

There are six keywords in total, and I have listed them all here for your convenience:

INJECT:key - this mode tries to inject the script into an existing entry. Errors if the respective entry does not exist.

REPLACE:key - this mode replaces an existing entry with a new one. Errors if the respective entry does not exist.

TRY\_INJECT:key same as INJECT: but does not error if the entry does not exist.

TRY\_REPLACE:key same as REPLACE: but does not error if the entry does not exist.

REPLACE\_OR\_CREATE:key = { } # Same as REPLACE: but if the entry does not exist, it will create it

INJECT\_OR\_CREATE:key = { } # Same as INJECT: but if the entry does not exist, it will create it

If used properly these keywords will help you to avoid a lot of compatibility issues altogether as well as allow you to reorganize compatibility with several existing mods in an easier fashion, granted that you talk to your fellow modders that is!

**Bear in mind that you will have to explicitly invoke these keywords and that implicit replacement will no longer be allowed and that you now have the time to update your mods accordingly!**

Lastly I have added a list of databases that this new system applies to below:

# Building Groups Cleanup

Speaking of things that will crash your mods on startup:

For one, we have renamed a couple of buildings, you should be able to make these out very easily when the patch launches and those can be taken care of by a simple mass replace in your editor. We did this to ensure that the building keys have more consistent naming.

The second and more significant change is that state region resources now operate on building types rather than building groups. To illustrate, here's an example of how resource setup looks in map\_data/state\_regions, new vs old:

New:  
arable\_resources = { ""building\_wheat\_farm"" }

capped\_resources = {

building\_fishing\_wharf = 4

}

resource = {

type = ""building\_oil\_rig""

undiscovered\_amount = 40

}

\# NOTE END

Old:

\# NOTE TO CMs: put this in a \[CODE\] block:

arable\_resources = { ""bg\_wheat\_farms"" }

capped\_resources = {

bg\_fishing = 4

}

resource = {

type = ""bg\_oil\_extraction""

undiscovered\_amount = 40

}

The reason for this change is that we had a lot of building groups (such as bg\_wheat\_farms) that only existed to make it possible to define them in resources and it made the whole building group system very unwieldy. Instead of each farm having its own building group, they are now all part of bg\_staple\_crops. The removed groups still exist in the database for now for legacy reasons but aren't used anymore, and will be fully removed in 1.13.

To make the transition a bit less painful we have added reverse read support so if you input a building group in resources it'll try to read the building group's default building type. This support will be killed in 1.13 though, so it's still a good idea to update your mod to the new format!

# Moddable War Goals

Anyways with that out of the way let's move on to our next topic: **scripted war goal types**!

We know that this is something that a lot of you have been requesting for a very long time which is why I'm happy to finally be able to say that we did it. To this end, we have finally added a new database in the form of the common/war\_goal\_types folder. (Thank you Alex! :) )

When the update arrives this folder will be filled with our regular war goals which have been transferred to this system as well though with the caveat that a lot of the vanilla ones have behaviours that are governed in code so make sure that you are careful when you are modifying them instead of just adding new ones.

I didn’t have the time to add a cool new war goal to VTM2 which is why im just going to do us both a favour and toss in the example documentation here, enjoy!

# Contextless Journal Entries

Contextless Journal Entries, or “Global JEs” as I will refer to them from here on out, are a new type of journal entry flag. Before we proceed to the cool part of this I have to give you yet another warning for **this update will also break many of your JEs!** 

To unbreak them you will have to go to your journal entry groups (in common/journal\_entry\_groups) and ensure that your custom groups have a context set. You can do that by simply adding one of the two context flags to all of your JE groups:

“context = none/country”

With “country” being the default one that you should attach to all your regular JE groups that are simply spawned and attached to a country and None being the new context that we use for Global Journal Entries.

Global JEs themselves are scripted much like any other Journal Entry but they come with a bunch of new additional triggers and effects to account for the fact that they may be a shared object between several countries. It should be pretty self explanatory overall but it's a really cool and exciting feature that we will use a lot going forward and we can't wait to see you all get your hands on it as well!

[The Peru-Bolivia Confederation is an example of an existing piece of content that has been updated to use this new system](https://preview.redd.it/k0hqsesrwf0g1.png?width=567&format=png&auto=webp&s=442b010674955d510cafbb596fc2eb866e98df84)

# Geographic Regions

Another new feature we have added is Geographic Regions, these are arbitrarily defined and static script lists that you can use for all sorts of triggers and checks.

[Geographic Regions also come with map highlighting!](https://preview.redd.it/sohyfkqwwf0g1.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=396fbd2b846928112e9dbd48267618d822d103f8)

Adding these geographic regions is exceedingly simple, you first create a new file in your common/geographic\_regions folder and write your lists into them:

[Some new geographic regions in Central Asia](https://preview.redd.it/rky44tuywf0g1.png?width=460&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0ec18156795e403474b7b96f247afc5d1d9f200)

I’ll also toss in the documentation for those:

geographic\_region\_key = {

\# All state/strategic regions are added together to form a geographic region

\# the key to access this in script lists i.e <any/..>\_<state/...>\_in\_europe

short\_key = ""europe""

\# The Strategic Regions this geographic region encompasses

strategic\_regions = { sr:<key> sr:<key> sr:<key> }

\# The State Regions this geographic region encompasses

state\_regions = { <STATE\_REGION> <STATE\_REGION> }

}

\# Add a ""<geographic\_region\_key>\_desc"" localization key to include fluff/lore description of your geographic region

# Regional Production Methods

One new feature that is very closely tied to Geographic Regions is the ability to define Production Methods that are specific to a part of the world, which allows us to add a lot more variation into the mix even for existing buildings, by for example unlocking special Coffee Production Methods in the “Humid Coffee Belt” Geographic Region. 

Please keep in mind that all numbers and designations you see below are very much work in progress!

[While some geographic regions are more restricted in their size, the Humid Coffee Belt spans a larger part of the world:](https://preview.redd.it/9cqjssn2xf0g1.png?width=1135&format=png&auto=webp&s=712a2a4974edb284b86ebd727eb3975056fd09df)

# Culturally Defined Name Order

You can now define the order in which names are represented via a new flag in the cultures database, by default this will be set to first\_last but you may now also opt into last\_first instead, meaning last or family names will be first and personal or first names will be put last.

[Korean is one of the cultures that uses this new naming scheme. Here we have Queen-Regent Myeonggyeong, wait, was she always here?](https://preview.redd.it/vdu29zu4xf0g1.png?width=567&format=png&auto=webp&s=38a7f723ce3848823b0e32f5e1496dfa3d7f77bf)

We have applied this system to cultures across the world that we found it applicable to. Be honest with me, how many of you knew that traditionally Hungarian also puts last names first?

# The Console

The console buttons have also received a bit of a facelift including a bunch of new buttons for commonly used commands and cheats. 

The eagle-eyed amongst you may also have spotted the new Inspect Country button which will open up the script runner window for your currently selected or observed country. You can also open up the inspector via console command. For example “inspect\_country GBR” will open up the window for Great Britain.

[Look at my buttons, ye Mighty!](https://preview.redd.it/vgngmu97xf0g1.png?width=426&format=png&auto=webp&s=b81063b25650544bf60d2d584645ee1fe9ab05c6)

Inspired by CK3 we have also added some more contextual debug buttons elsewhere, like a right-click menu button to kill a selected character for example. Purely for testing purposes of course!

We plan on adding more in the future.

[Please welcome our newest employee!](https://preview.redd.it/fu4lvd19xf0g1.png?width=271&format=png&auto=webp&s=53308d2f31896a80e0863fd188fb04edef27e5e8)

# Script Only Modifiers

At long last, we have also added the ability to properly define script only modifiers, or “fake modifiers” as I like to call them. By adding a “script\_only = yes” flag to your modifier in common/modifier\_type\_definitions. Doing this will suppress the error that you would otherwise receive and should no longer clog up your error log.

# Law Amendments

Law Amendments, as introduced by Victoria in the last [Dev Diary](https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-163-the-fine-print.1867438/), are also completely moddable of course! You can define amendments in the newly created common/amendments database and then add them to your laws via a new effect. 

I'll once again add an example below:

amendment\_test = {

parent = law\_peasant\_levies # optional reference to a law that dictates what stances IGs and movements have toward this amendment

allowed\_laws = { # list of laws that the amendment can be added to

law\_professional\_army

law\_national\_militia

law\_mass\_conscription

law\_census\_voting

}

modifier = {}

tax\_modifier\_very\_low = {}

tax\_modifier\_low = {}

tax\_modifier\_medium = {}

tax\_modifier\_high = {}

tax\_modifier\_very\_high = {}

possible = {

always = yes

}

   can\_repeal = {  
always = yes  
  }

ai\_will\_revoke = {

always = yes

}

}

\# The effect:

\## add\_amendment

Adds an amendment to the scoped law.  

add\_amendment = {  

type = amendment\_example  

sponsor = interest\_group  

cooldown = 120 # months  

timeout = 240  # months (optional, 0 = none)  

}

\*\*Supported Scopes\*\*: law  

Well looking back that was quite a lot, but not everything! As always we have added a range of new triggers, modifier types, effects and smaller improvements to modding to the game but since we have already amassed this rather large list and the Dev Diary is getting long I'll leave the rest of it up to the changelog in a couple of weeks.

Once again I would like to thank you all for your continued support and the incredible mods that you are all creating out there! :)

Our warehouse went from swipe on your phone to a shiny on site time clock. New policy said no exceptions, if you are not clocked in you are not working. They also removed the five minute grace because attendance needs to be tighter. The email ended with a cheerful reminder to be a team player. Cool. I like rules when they are clear.



Day one with the new clock, two dozen people all hit the door at 7 55. The device lives after security, past the only turnstile. Security checks bags, then you shuffle to the screen that reads faces in slow motion. I got in line at 7 56. By the time the scanner recognized me it was 8 07 and my start time on the schedule is 8 00. I pulled my gloves out, then stopped. The policy said do not work unless you are clocked in. So I did not work before 8 07. I also wrote the delay on the little incident sheet like they told us.



The supervisors did not love that. They asked why the pick line was still dark at 8 05. I smiled and pointed at my timestamp. Later they pulled a few of us aside and said be proactive, start staging while you wait. I said staging is work, the rule says wait until the clock. They said use common sense. I said I will use company policy. This repeated the next morning. The line got longer because folks from the other wing now share the same unit. I made coffee at home and brought a book. If I am off the clock, I am not theirs.



I also adjusted the rest of my day to the minute. Ten minute break started when I left my station and ended when I got back to my station with gloves on, not when I walked away from the clock area. Lunch was thirty by the book. At shift end I stopped mid pallet at 4 00 and walked to the scanner. If a lead asked for help after I punched out I smiled and said happy to if you clock me back in. They did not.



By the end of week one we had three late trucks and a lot of scoreboard red. Safety pointed out that making people rush through a choke point every morning is not great. Payroll hated the mess of in at 8 06, out at 4 00, plus tiny overtime flags because the line back to the clock at end of day was also slow. Monday morning there were two more clocks, one in each wing, and the grace period quietly returned. The email said thank you for the feedback. I said nothing. I just clocked in at 7 58 and started work at 8 00 like a normal human again.

1otfw09,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1otfw09/i_dont_feel_anything/,I don't feel anything,"My last ex (dated from 2021-2023) told me that she thinks I'm extremely emotionally stunted or just completely disconnected from reality. She thought I was a legit sociopath at one point. I never hurt her physically or mentally but she tells me I was very neglectful of her feelings and was overall very cold. It wasn't my intention, I felt quite sick hearing her say that. Over coffee after the breakup, I asked her what I should do, she recommended therapy so I tried and after 20 sessions I gave up because it felt like the doc was just not responding to my actual issue.

Another coffee with my ex, she asks me what I feel about things in general, I didn't know what she meant so she pointed at some art and asked me what I feel about it, I said nothing. she asked me what I felt about my car, my job, my apartment, the music I listen to. I genuinely didn't have an answer for her, I don't feel anything about any of it and I thought that was normal. She asked me what I felt about her and asked why I dated her if I felt nothing. My answer was ""you asked me and I said yes"". She explained to me that sounds psychotic, I told her it was the truth whichever way it may sound.

A few weeks ago, me and a close friend had sex. Honestly can't really remember who initiated it but it was fine, we both enjoyed it. The morning after my friend asked me what I felt, I asked her what she meant and she said about us? I told her we were friends, asked if I had done anything to make her feel like we weren't. She said no in a very confused way and the conversation shifted into getting breakfast.

She then later explained to me that she's had feelings for me for a while and wanted to know if I would be interested in a relationship. I recalled back to the conversation with my ex and that ""you asked and I said yes"" was the wrong answer if I didn't feel anything, so I said no. She's taken it very well, understandably a little upset but we're still friends.

But the whole situation has made me start thinking about my ex, my friends, her. Why don't I feel things at all? Why do I navigate through conversations like they are puzzles? 

I spoke to a doctor about me potentially being autistic, I did the tests and got a second opinion, both conclusive that I am not autistic, though obvious signs of emotional detachment. I left feeling empty, like always. I wish I knew what I was.

1otfvqz,https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/1otfvqz/doing_my_1st_48might_go_more/,Doing my 1st 48…might go more,"
After having started my fasting around a month ago with a 36 hr fast. Monitoring my weight with a “smart scale”. 

Scale shows a drop from 207 on 11/4 to 197.3 this morning. Body fat % was 27.9 and read 25.8 (same dates).

That’s right at a 10lb drop and will probably be more by the time I end my 48 at 3:30pm today. Will probably push out until I get home so I can weigh to get my final numbers before breaking the fast with some scrambled eggs and then some skinless chicken or fish. Currently drinking black coffee with a bit of cinnamon and a couple of squirts of vanilla (no sugar but does have alcohol which I know is sugar), and two 1L TopoChico’s every day. Have been doing 18:6 for the past week up to Saturday when I started my current fast. 

I am physically active (oil & gas industry) and am doing low weight/high rep workouts due to being six months out from rotator cuff surgery. 

Goal is to see my abs for the first time. Didn’t see them even after graduating Boot Camp in 1987 (Happy Birthday today to any fellow Marines).

Currently 56 and we have a trip planned to Cancun in the summer. Trying to get Speedo ready. 

My question: 
I know the scale is not as accurate as calipers or hydrostatic testing but has anyone else found a scale that is…let’s say “more accurate” than another? Mine is a “GE scale for body weight” per the Amazon description. I am looking to buy one recommended by PC Mag made by Etekcity. ",4,1762786519.0,fasting,7,1.0,False
1otfvp9,https://www.reddit.com/r/7JackesAvenueToronto/comments/1otfvp9/some_updatescoffee_and_conversation_impressions_7/,Some Updates/Coffee and Conversation impressions - 7 Jackes Avenue,"I am sure I'm not alone in posters to this Subreddit to be in crunch-time and quite busy, hence no updates i na while.

But I think we should take stock as to where we are, coming out of recent events (water temperature and pressure issues after the shut down, only for tenants to be by staff to ""wait for it to warm up"" - but fortunately soon coming to their senses keeping the plumbers on site, and this time repairing the issue immediately). During the ""coffee and conversation"" event, Cari O'Leary admitted that the building was fully responsible for the 'error' in the switchover. One wonders if all tenants affected by the flooding and damage to their walls have been issued an apology, and had their units quickly re-painted and plastered? It was not a good sign that at least most tenants present at this event have not had their filters changed for the season. There are some tenants who may do so themselves or have outside contacts that can help them. But the building, at least as of the event ten days ago, had not yet changed tenant filters. This is a health and safety issue.

My impression, also informed by the event, is that the building is trying to split the difference in, on one hand, ""making right"" with frustrated tenants, and on the other, cutting corners and continuing to effectively mismanage the building without doing damage. It is quite clear, I believe, even to SK, that the building is woefully short-staffed. Thus, the most interesting part of the ""Coffee and Conversation event"" is the fact that top management are at least - claiming - to be looking into a concierge - not merel security - for the building. They are, as they claim ""taking their time"" to find someone who is ""right for the building"" and queried tenants as to what they look for in a concierge.

In turn they seem to acknowledge that without security, the front door (which a tenant pointed out was installed unevenly) will keep being damaged, whether from being wedged open or contractors ignoring the fact that they must move large items through the loading bay on the RF level.

Yet last week, at least three times, I saw contractors and/or movers moving items through the front door. It really seems odd that, in the period that we are without security or a concierge, that a direct camera feed from the front door area is not present in the office area for onsite staff to watch. This was the case when Summerhill Properties managed the building - all cameras were visible, so if Klara Parish or Miroslav or other onsite staff saw something, they'd immediately be able to attend to it. Instead of this, tenants have had to be proactive and inform staff, who, depending on who is onsite, will often be unable to get through to contractors who ignore them, and/or be unaware of building procedure. Indeed the lack of awareness of building procedure was made quite clear during the coffee and conversation event in which a new tenant admitted that no one did any orientation for them.

What was shocking to me is that Cari O'Leary called the city order to take care of our complete shambles of a parking lot, full of potholes and hazards, floods, leaks, chipping paint, ceilings collapsing, duct-tape everywhere - was ""purely aesthetic"". This is arguably a violation of the spirit of tenant parking agreements. Indoor parking is indoor parking. Not indoor parking in a garage that regularly floods and has surfaces akin to country roads. They are appealing this order, and I will note that no appeal has been hung up on the tenant bulletin board.

As to cockroaches, the building mentioned that they were planning ""preventive spraying"" for every unit and weren't clear as to what this meant. Some tenants expressed concerns that the spraying could disburse the cockroaches to other units - especially upwards, and units that don't have cockroach ""activity"" should perhaps not be sprayed. Indeed one tenant pointed out that on a higher floor, they saw a cockroach crawling out of the laundry chute. This, comically, created a bit of an ""aha"" moment among building management, and it seemed to be decided they would spray each unit from the top floor down. I am not an expert in pest control, and as a layperson it seems reasonable to preventively spray units, but I think some of us should contact Summerhill Properties and see what their procedure would be at a time like this. I will say that I doubt they follow through on this for months - it's only today, as far as I know, that the railing replacements are starting - this was announced I believe six months ago.

There is more that was said. Take the pool. Staff have not being paying attention to the pleas from tenants and even the pool contractor to service the pool far more often. This should give everyone pause (and there seems to be an impression the pleas from the pool contractor, a consummate professional, were not sent 'up the chain' by onsite staff), or that there is dispute between longstanding tenants and the building as to enforcing the longstanding rule as to number of people in the pool.

This is related to Cari O'Leary's reply to questions about how the building's demographic has shifted, and how staff can navigate this while ensuring longstanding tenants don't effectively lose amenities (including a pool and gym that are used respectfully). Feigning compassion, O'Leary made the claim that tenants ""didn't like that young adults lived in the building"" and that they ""aren't allowed to not rent to young adults"" and their families, putting up a straw person. The issue, of course, is not young adults and families - when I moved into this building 20 years ago, I was in my early 30s. It is not being properly oriented to the building.

In general, other issues mentioned - issues that continue to linger -short term rentals, following up on laundry maintenance, etc. - have not been followed up upon since the discussion.

As per usual, SK seems to be kicking the can down the road - but it is somewhat promising that they are considering a concierge. But in the meantime, they have been hit with new orders to comply by the city as to cleanliness/waste. Hope to see those posted soon.....",3,1762786516.0,7JackesAvenueToronto,0,1.0,False

It was middle of the night and it looked like I had coughed up black coffee grounds. I then fell asleep and woke up that morning with moderate to severe flu like symptoms but only for an hour or 2, but the blood has still been continued to be coughed up.Currently the boold is my only symptom of any kind of sickness.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

* So how did our Thanksgiving narrative come to focus on a fantastical meal shared between colonists and American Indians? What messages did Americans hope to convey with the Thanksgiving holiday? What were some popular Thanksgiving foods of generations past?
* Most Saturdays in November, Bennett Place staff lead guided tours that explore the history & legacy of this Civil War era federal holiday. These tours include a living history component, preparing a 19th-century dish within the Bennett's kitchen.
* November 1-29
* Admission: $8 adults, $6 seniors, military/veterans, children

1otfqxc,https://i.redd.it/3gq40x9f0g0g1.jpeg,[Google play?] [2014-2018] A digital dollhouse type game with paper animals,"Hello everyone!This is my first time posting on Reddit. I had this game on my old phone when I was little, probably somewhere around 2014 to 2018. The art style was not very childish; it was more like an old indie game, with a vintage paper/autumn aesthetic and very realistic graphics. The gameplay was like a Toca Boca-type of digital dollhouse game. I remember one of the main characters was a paper blue deer (most of the characters were colorful paper animals), and you could move him around a little house and make him interact with objects, like drinking coffee or sitting at the table. From what I can remember, the icon was the face of the blue deer with a yellow background. Also, the company that produced the game had produced a couple more in the same style and with the same characters.",2,1762786204.0,tipofmyjoystick,0,1.0,False
1otfqwt,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1otfqwt/learning_to_say_no_at_the_doctor_changed/,Learning to say no at the doctor changed everything for me,"



I grew up as a very polite patient. I apologized for taking time, I nodded when a plan did not quite match my symptoms, I said I was fine when I was not. By 31 I was exhausted all the time, bloated, dizzy after lunch, and waking up with my heart pounding. Every visit ended with drink more water and try yoga. I do like water and yoga, still felt like trash. This spring I decided to try again, but with a very different approach.



I wrote a one page timeline the night before my appointment. Three short sections only. What I feel, when it happens, what has helped a little. No fluff, just dates and patterns. I also added two goals for the visit. Test for iron and ask about sleep study. I printed two copies and stuck them in my bag so I would not chicken out. I asked my friend to come as my note buddy. Her job was to sit and write what the doctor said and to remind me to ask my two goals if I froze.



The visit started like usual. The doctor glanced at my chart and asked about stress and if I drink coffee. I handed over the page and said this is the pattern I am seeing and I want to rule out anemia and sleep apnea. Saying want felt strong in my mouth. The doctor paused, read, and said ok we can do ferritin, B12, A1c, thyroid, and a referral for a sleep study. She explained what each test might tell us and we scheduled a follow up. My friend wrote it all down while I just breathed and tried not to cry.



Results came back the next week. Ferritin was very low, I started iron with vitamin C and a gentler schedule to avoid stomach pain. The sleep study showed mild apnea, which explained the pounding wake ups and the mid afternoon brain fog. Two months in, I am not a new person, but I can stand up without the room tilting and I do not fall asleep on the bus anymore. I also switched my period pain care after we noticed my iron dipped hardest after long cycles. That tiny paper gave me a map and the right words.



If you are stuck, try this. Make the one pager the day before. Bring a person who can take notes and back you up. Practice saying I want to rule out X and Y, then stop talking. If a plan does not answer your goals, ask what the next step is and when to follow up. It feels awkward the first time, then it feels like respect. You deserve that in every room that has your name on a chart.

So I wanted to make a small script to get prices of the next \~30 days in advance, so I can plan which days to travel and when it's best to buy the tickets.

Searching online I could only find BRfares which apparently charges £50/month for 1500 API calls.

£50 buys me nearly two days of travel, so it's not exactly worth for my use case, but I would still like to try and find the best time to buy my tickets ~~and potentially save a few quid to get an overpriced coffee in London from time to time~~

Does anyone know of a free API that could return this information? Thanks!",2,1762786160.0,uktrains,2,1.0,False

* **Color Coded Amounts**

The big lift this week was adding status colors to the amounts when selecting a bucket to move money or the type drop down, green for available, yellow for underfunded, red for overdraft, grey for zero. This ended being more work than expected due to the performance of calculating the many different reasons for underfunding (default assignments, target dates, future transactions, upcoming recurrences etc). But this is live now on web and on the latest version of mobile and should be helpful particularly when covering overdrafts in buckets.

* **Payee Auto Complete**

Some payees were missing from the suggestion list if they were only added to Recurring transactions, this should be fixed now.

* **Import Balance**

The total balance of imported transactions will now display on the preview screen before importing.

* **Transaction filtering defaults**

The default transaction view for an account now shows all transactions, which is what most people expect to see. The filter buttons to hide non-reconciled and future transactions will appear pressed when filtering is enabled, same for mobile.

* **Table Performance/Filter prep**

Transactions for accounts is now faster with smarter calculation of recurring transactions. In addition the mobile transaction tables were refactored to support filtering, although its not currently in place in the UI yet.

* **What's Next**

Seems like the right time to start adding transaction filtering options to mobile. I need to clear up some header real estate on the account transactions to show the merge/split button, so my plan is to add filtering and move search to All Transactions. I'd also like to persist the filter options (as well as the accounts non-reconciled filter).

As always thank you and I appreciate you all,

I’ve been in love before, but this time it feels completely different. I’ve never met anyone who sees me the way he does.

Sometimes I find it hard to open up and be authentic because I grew up with a mum who has bipolar, so I got used to being the strong one — the caretaker. But the way he looks after me is something I’ve never experienced before.

I still remember the first time I stayed at his place. He’s ADHD and pretty messy, and I have OCD — but he made such an effort to tidy before I arrived. He was so stressed making me a vegetarian cottage pie because he wanted it to be perfect 😭 Then when I was showering, I asked if he had any shower gel (I struggle with bar soap because of my OCD), and he immediately went out to buy some for me. The next time I stayed over, he’d gone out and bought the same one I use at home. 🥺

He’s taken so much time to understand my trauma and is always curious about how he can support me better. He never makes me feel like I’m “too much.” He’s validating, reassuring, and always notices the little things I do — and actually tells me he’s grateful for me.

We’re long distance, but we talk every morning and every night. I travel a lot for work, and he always keeps me company on the phone during long drives so I don’t get sleepy.

One big turning point for me was when I had a really low day — he dropped everything, drove down that same evening just to be with me. He’s so thoughtful: when I stay over, he’ll wake up early to make me coffee in a travel mug, and he even leaves an umbrella out for me when it’s raining ☕☔

When I opened up about my previous sexual assault, his response was everything I needed. He was gentle, validating, and didn’t press me for details. He told me he’d always respect my boundaries and that he was proud of how much I’d overcome — even though I shouldn’t have had to.

He’s just… the best. And he doesn’t even realise how amazing he is, even though I try to tell him all the time. I feel so lucky to be with him. ❤️

We’re both 30, we’ve both been through our share of trauma, and somehow we found each other. I just can’t believe how safe and loved I feel — and I can’t wait to tell him I love him this weekend. 🥰",1,1762786089.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

[https://www.reddit.com/r/raleigh/comments/1oslb7a/the\_panera\_on\_glenwood\_now\_requires\_a\_code\_for/](https://www.reddit.com/r/raleigh/comments/1oslb7a/the_panera_on_glenwood_now_requires_a_code_for/)

I have been going to this Panera for years and years - to hang out, drink coffee, warm up, and use the restroom. Never had a problem, because I don't cause problems. I'm sure this is how the VAST MAJORITY of us homeless people are - quiet, considerate, respectful, clean up after ourselves, don't make a mess, don't act crazy, etc....

As clueless as most of the comments are - making generalizations about ""homeless people"" (like we're all exactly the same - ie: imagine the worst possible stereotype) - what they all miss is that nobody suffers more from the consequences of terrible behavior on the part of a problematic homeless person who abuses the bathroom, causes a problem, bothers customers, makes a mess, destroys things, etc...than the rest of us who also rely on being able to have a safe, clean, well-maintained restroom to use. It really pisses me off. 

One by one, all the places I have had available to take a dump or a piss are being taken away by some fucking asshole who has caused an incident. This just reinforces everyone's worst concept and generalization about ""the homeless"". No wonder all the fucking rich assholes around here hate the homeless - it just takes one drug-addicted, shirtless, yelling, bathroom-destroying fuck-up to take away a valuable resource that I have counted on. (yes, I witnessed this a month ago at this exact Panera location).

All homeless people aren't the same. I wish people would some damn common sense and common courtesy and that they wouldn't ruin things for the rest of us.",5,1762786029.0,homeless,1,0.78,False

Maple: So, let's start by talking about the emotions you guys are feeling right now.  
Sally: Stabbing.

Maple: I have a bad habit of calling things ""loathsome"" if they mildly inconvenience me...

Payne: Uh, this isn't really tilted. Or a tower.   
Myst: Well you see, it's a gamer pad. Not many girls come in here because I get friendzoned so frequently. But that's okay.   
Payne: I'd like to be in the Friendzone! I like friends!   
Myst: It's not as pleasant as you think. They don't treat you like a friend. They treat you like an item. Sometimes I wish I could be more than just an accessory to these women; But unfortunately, as a gamer, I don't get respect.

Marx: What must it be like to live in your head? Are there happy ponies in there? It’s really something how utterly delusional your optimism is. If I didn’t hate you so much, I might even be impressed.

At the start, I wanted something reminiscent of Pi, since it’s always been a favorite, but couldn’t really find any that gave me that same feeling.  My collection has really exploded, with some amazing scents, both designer and some dupes.  I had been reading about Khamrah and K Qahwa for a bit and finally decided to try it.  Wow!  This immediately gave me that Pi feel, though not smelling the same, gave off that vibe.  That warm, gourmand perfect winter feel.  The performance is also absolute beast mode.

2025 - I again asked for mindset based coach, they gave me food only ""coach"" and now all she wants me is to eliminate roti/rice/vegetables and only eat tempeh, zucchini, edamame, chickoo, mango, baby corn

Heck they even told, why are you taking coffee with protein shake, its bad for you, reason - nothing, trust me bro.

on my own i eat jowar roti+ spinach juice (well she also told sattu & spinach juice is bad)+ paneer + curd + isabgol + muesli + chia etc etc (basically same stuffs which let me to reduce 20kgs).

Lastly i told her, what about habits or Exercise part - she was like yeah you do 15 mins walk daily, thats fine for now (that too when i told her i was gym-ing 2 months back but left for some reason)

I asked cult to change my coach, there reply - ""our Transform Programme is designed holistically, and all our coaches are equally trained across all verticals — including fitness, nutrition, and mindset. You’ll receive balanced guidance to help you achieve your goals"".

1otflaa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1otflaa/my_first_paranormal_investigation/,My First Paranormal Investigation,"Hey, I already shared this on r/GhostHunting, but I wanted to reach as many people as possible to get different advice from people with their own stories.  
  
Last night, I had my first proper paranormal investigation, and I wanted to share it on here since I have nobody else to tell about it.

My buddy and I (both 17) have zero experience, and we're both skeptics. He is less convinced that the unseen world exists and surrounds us than I am. No... I didn't drag him with me. Ever since an odd encounter we had in an abandoned small-town house where a murder supposedly happened, we have been much more intrigued by the paranormal, and if there is more to it.

We've been to quite a few abandoned places, but never any haunted ones. Finding a haunted location was particularly tedious, as we live in a random shitstain in the countryside of Denmark.

After some research, I come across a mansion with some lore behind it, and soon after, I found even more information, and bingo, it included a ghost story.

The landowner had a bad reputation as a peasant tormentor. Rumors spread around the village that his spirit wandered around the farm after his death in 1749.

This was perfect for us, I thought. So, I printed out the papers at my local library and made them look old and antique with coffee and candles.

Fast forward to yesterday. At this point, we've known about the place for about 1/2 months.

On the chilly day of the ninth of November, we decided to head out to search the mansion.

The drive wasn't as short as we had wished; it was about 44 miles in the direction of nowhereville.

Our first stop was the church where the landowner was supposedly buried. My friend and I wanted to test my brand new K-II EMF meter at the graveyard.

The moment we stepped out of the car, we met two fellas with headlamps and metal detectors. Kinda odd, but we said hello and continued on foot to the church.

Just before we reached the church, we decided that we should unpack the other piece of 'equipment' that I had brought with us. The Ouija board. Yes... I know some folks, particularly in this sub-reddit have strong opinions about it, but my friend and I are skeptics, remember that.

We awkwardly unboxed it at a dimly lit bus stop with my buddy's car key coming in clutch, decided to skip the church for now, and carried the octagonal-shaped board and planchette with us to the mansion which was about half a mile up the road.

Our hearts first sank when we came across a 'monitored area' sign near the barn at the mansion. We couldn't back out, not now. My friend was pretty freaked out, he kept pointing out the weird 'wind noise', which was really just a plane. So we continued along the road, and after a short while, we stood awe-struck, gazing at the humongous mansion towering above us.

Have any of you played that \*one\* Red Dead Redemption 2 mission? That's how it felt and looked. It was very ominous.

Before we continued, I tapped my buddy on the shoulder cause I noticed light emitting from a garage inside the barn next to the mansion. We inspected it a bit closer, and there was indeed light inside.

We forgot about it and moved on. I'm pretty convinced that it was just automatic 24/7 light.

The tall front door of the mansion was locked, but I had read from an anonymous commenter on an urbex website that there was an easy entry point in the yard through a broken window.

Someone had placed a bar stool below the window for even easier access. Entering was a bit awkward, as I was carrying a backpack with tools, and my friend was carrying a large Ouija board.

We made it inside, brushed the dust from the window sill off our leather jackets, and looked around in the first room. To our surprise, it was very empty. Most abandoned places, in our experience, are very messy.

We wanted to search some of the rooms before attempting to contact any spirits. The search was swift. When we found a somewhat secluded room where our flashlights weren't visible from outside, we sat down.

My friend prepared the Ouija board on the musty floor, and I turned on our K-II EMF reader and placed it beside the board.

We were respectful in our tone when we asked questions to the spirits we wanted to contact. However, despite the fact we dearly wanted it, and tried to believe in it, we had zero contact, and there was no activity at all.

The planchette never moved, the meter never blinked, and we heard no odd sounds except for creaking floors, a bird having a stroke outside that sounded like a skinwalker, and maybe a little nervous fart.

After about an hour inside the mansion, my friend insisted he saw some moving lights outside, and then I went to check as well. In disbelief, I peeked through the broken glass in one of the windows, and to my surprise, there was indeed a light moving towards us.

Immediately, we kindly bid the spirits farewell as you're supposed to with a Ouija board, packed up the board, and bolted out to the yard through the window we entered from.

We hadn't even made it to the entrance of the mansion, when suddenly, an incredibly bright light, probably the same one we saw in the window, shone in our direction through the forest thicket to our side.

At first it looked like a very powerful flashlight moving around quickly. We were extra nervous, as it came from the area with camera surveillance.

My friend panicked, and we ran as if our lives depended on it. He jumped head first into the bushes, and I stood like an idiot in the muddy grass, and was almost exposed by the beams of light that filled the air.

Turned out to be car headlights. The car passed us rather quickly. Did we overreact? Maybe, but we didn't want to risk it all... and we have prior experience with these types of 'run-ins' with folks you don't want to meet at abandoned places...

As soon as the car passed, we made our way to the road and headed back to the car. When we were about to reach the church, we saw another car approach us, and we were completely and utterly exposed in our current position.

Two teens in the middle of a dark road, one with a yellow backpack and the other with a cyan glow-in-the-dark octagonal-shaped demon summoning board. Safe to say we would have been cooked if it was public authority approaching us. Not ideal.

When we saw the car we ran like crazy, took a right at the church, and then I quickly dashed to the bus stop and put down my backpack to seem less suspicious.

We played it suuuper cool once it passed us. Phew.

Just as we thought we were in the clear, my friend noticed the car had a phone number on the back, and he immediately tied that to a surveillance/security vehicle monitoring the area.

""Do we make a run for it?"" he asked, and I absolutely loved the sound of that.

Never in my life have I been so close to what felt like a heart attack inducing sprint.

At last, we had made it to the warm and safe car. Of course, that wasn't the end of it. I forgot that I had put my backpack at the bus stop. My bright yellow backpack with a half-filled bottle of holy water, my credit card, phone and papers.

I quickly ran over and picked it up, and then we drove home.

Despite our 'unsuccessful' investigation, we don't believe less in the unseen world than we did a week ago.

Him and I are pretty sure that a major reason our devices didn't work, is because the ghost stories were just rumors, and that the mansion isn't actually haunted, not because we didn't have enough faith or didn't believe in it.

Both of us want to believe, and we are committed to scouring every place we find for viable proof.

And also, the dad lore will be absolutely diabolical in a short 20 years.

1otfkog,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1otfkog/indie_hackers_project_turned_into_a_proper_saas/,Indie hacker's project turned into a proper SaaS - Signalbase's story,"Hey folks, Georgi here!

Currently building [Signalbase](https://www.trysignalbase.com/) which is a real-time intent data provider helping GTM teams be the *first to reach out when a signal occurs.*

Normally, I’m a [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgi-furnadzhiev/) type of guy.

But my co-founders convinced me to step out of my comfort zone and share the full story here. Partly because other builders might find value in it, and partly because many GTM folks will (hopefully) resonate with this truth:

👉 Running outbound around **firmographic-based lists** is fundamentally broken.

In this post, I’ll break down:

* The early story of **Leadsontrees**, before I joined
* How I became part of the team
* And how the four of us ended up **locked in Chiang Mai**, building Signalbase’s next chapter

**1️⃣ The Birth of Leadsontrees (what happened before I joned)**

It all started with Tadas, a Lithuanian builder who ships fast and often.  
Among his many projects was Leadsontrees, a real-time VC database that automatically tracked funding announcements as they happened.

The idea was simple but powerful: Once a funding signal occurs, just put it in a dashboard so VCs can reach out to the right companies.

The product was cleanly engineered, bootstrapped, and already pulling real data.  
But it didn’t yet have the **go-to-market engine** to turn it into a scalable business.

That’s when **Adriaan** (my now co-founder & CTPO) and **Iron** (our 2nd commercial co-founder) discovered it.

They reached out to Tadas, saw the potential, and eventually **acquired it.** At that point, Leadsontrees became their *third company*, next to **Simple Analytics** and **UniHosted**.

It already had a few paying customers including a few big teams like Rho, Workramp and Hubspot roughly **$3K in lifetime deals,** but no one was driving growth full-time.

They needed a “main driver"" and that's when Iron started looking for me.

**2️⃣ Entering the Business**

Around that same time, I was working as a **Growth Lead** at *The Growth Syndicate (TGS)* working hard on creating of one of the biggest [vetted conferences](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/georgi-furnadzhiev_we-did-it-tgs-con-is-now-officially-part-activity-7379060531707662336-Kabz?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAADL-V-kBZ5Dd-k90zDpKft0ia3Qr36MFn1M) for GTM operators and hands-on execs.

Somewhere in **July 2025**, Iron reached out asking for feedback on Leadsontrees. Originally ,it was meant to be a short call. However, It turned into a one hour brainstorm.

While others gave product feedback, I couldn’t help thinking bigger:

Leadsontrees didn’t need to be “a better funding tracker.”  
It could evolve into a **real-time signal intelligence platform.**  Something easy to use which is super custom that sits on top of your GTM stack and constantly feeds it with *fresh, actionable data.*

So Iron and I met for coffee. Talked about data freshness, intent scoring, timing in sales, and why 90% of intent vendors are basically selling a myth.

Just 30 minutes later he put the cards on the table by asking me ""Do you want to be the main driver?"" and just like that I joined the team.

And that’s how **Signalbase** was born.  
(Shoutout to my girlfriend for the name 😂)

3️⃣ Prepping for the transition

In my final month before leaving my growth role, I talked to dozens of GTM leaders to validate the need for a *real-time signal provider.*

The response was strong. That same month, I helped the team lock in **three pilot projects** with GTM teams doing between **$10M and $80M ARR.**

To keep conversations real and avoid overpromising, I built a **simple prototype on Lovable** which, funny enough, ended up becoming the *foundation for our main dev work.*

**4️⃣ Grinding In Chiang Mai 🇹🇭**

Fast-forward to now.

I’m writing this from **Chiang Mai, Thailand**, where the four of us (*Tadas, Iron, Adriaan, and I* )  are spending a month together, building and shipping around the clock.

We’ve turned a **24/7 co-working space** into our HQ.  
No distractions. No side gigs. Just focus.

This trip will probably become a yearly ritual, but this edition is special: We’re officially **launching Signalbase** before flying home and hopefully have 1.5K in the bank (currently at $600 MRR)

**5️⃣ Our GTM Approach**

1. Partnership Ecosystem

Before leaving my last role, I built partnerships with top GTM operators and platforms.  
These will help us **amplify our launch** during the first week of December.

2. Multi-layer Outbound + Founder-led Sales

Right now, I’ve got about 4-5 outbound systems running in parallel:

* Targeting followers of relevant accounts
* Tracking competitor engagements
* Partnering or targeting certified “experts” for tool-stack distribution
* Manual social listening (the underrated gem)

I’ll probably forget a few, but I can make a full post breaking it all down if people are interested.

3. Content (Thought Leadership + Humor)

Just this morning, I dropped a [diss track](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/georgi-furnadzhiev_the-first-ever-diss-track-on-linkedin-is-activity-7393556234521686016-nbrI?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAADL-V-kBZ5Dd-k90zDpKft0ia3Qr36MFn1M) aimed at firmographic-based outbound. Honestly people loved it as it showed personality and called out a real issue.

Besides the fun stuff, we’re also producing deeper content about:

* Data hygiene in GTM
* Real signal-based workflows
* Case studies from early adopters
* And a bit of founder chaos behind the scenes

We’re even planning to host a **launch techno party in Amsterdam** for invite-only GTM execs, agency owners or fractionals

And soon, we’ll start recording our **podcast “My First Signal”**, where we help GTM teams build a *signal-first engine* in under 30 minutes per episode.

6️⃣ So what's next?

We’re not raising.  
We’re not chasing hype by saying that we offer ""buying signals"" or ""ready to buy leads""  
We’re just building something we’d personally use and it's actually helping teams convert deals faster.

Next up:

* Rolling out **free trials**, so people can experience live data firsthand
* Reconnecting with **our lifetime customers** to show them the new API (now with 3 layers of verification and expanded signals including hiring and job changes)

I’ll keep you posted on how it goes.

## How to Choose the Right Gift for a Coworker: The Golden Rules

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=christmas%20gifts%20for%20coworkers)

Before you dive into our epic list, let's quickly cover the basics. Picking a gift for someone you share a cubicle wall with can be tricky. Keep these simple tips in mind:

*   **Observe & Listen:** Pay attention to what they talk about. Are they always cold? Do they mention their love for spicy food? Are they obsessed with their new puppy? These little clues are goldmines for great gift ideas.
*   **Keep it Professional:** This is rule number one. Avoid anything too personal, intimate, or potentially offensive. When in doubt, err on the side of caution.
*   **Respect the Budget:** Office gift exchanges usually have a price limit. Stick to it. It makes the playing field level for everyone.
*   **Think Utility:** The best gifts are the ones people can actually use at work or in their daily lives. Practicality wins over pure novelty almost every time.

## The Ultimate Gift Guide: Christmas Gifts for Coworkers (Categorized!)

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=christmas%20gifts%20for%20coworkers)

We've broken down the best gift ideas by category and price, so you can find exactly what you're looking for, no matter your budget or your coworker's personality.

### ### Gifts Under $15 (Budget-Friendly & Brilliant)

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=christmas%20gifts%20for%20coworkers)

Just because you're on a budget doesn't mean your gift has to look cheap. These ideas are both affordable and impressive.

*   **High-Quality Coffee or Tea Sampler:** Most offices run on caffeine. A beautifully packaged set of artisanal coffee beans or exotic herbal teas is a gift that truly keeps on giving.
*   **A Nice succulent or small desk plant:** Bring a little life to their workspace. Succulents are low-maintenance and can brighten up a desk for months.
*   **Gourmet Hot Sauce Set:** Perfect for the coworker who always puts hot sauce on their lunch. It's a fun and unique way to spice up their meal routine.
*   **Luxe Hand Cream:** Office air can be incredibly drying. A high-quality, nicely-scented (or unscented!) hand cream is a small touch of luxury they'll appreciate all winter long.
*   **A Premium Notebook and Pen:** For the person who is always jotting down ideas. A sleek Moleskine notebook or a smooth-writing gel pen feels far more special than a standard notepad.
*   **Gourmet Chocolate Bar:** Skip the generic Hershey's bar and opt for a single, beautifully-wrapped artisanal chocolate bar from a local or well-regarded chocolatier.

### ### Mid-Range Marvels ($15 - $40)

If you have a bit more to spend, these gifts offer a significant step up in the ""wow"" factor.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=christmas%20gifts%20for%20coworkers)

*   **Ember Temperature Control Ceramic Mug (a smaller version):** For the coffee or tea lover who is always complaining about their drink getting cold. This tech-forward gift is a game-changer.
*   **Blue-Light Blocking Glasses:** A thoughtful and health-conscious gift for the coworker who stares at a screen all day. They can help reduce eye strain and headaches.
*   **A Desk Organizer or Caddy:** Help them conquer the clutter. A stylish bamboo or acrylic organizer can turn a chaotic desk into a Zen workspace.
*   **Portable Phone Charger:** In 2023, this is less of a luxury and more of a necessity. A slim, reliable power bank will save them from a dead battery during a long day.
*   **A High-Quality Lunch Bag or Bento Box:** Upgrade their lunch game from a sad plastic bag to a stylish, insulated bag or a sleek, compartmentalized bento box.

### ### Tech & Desk Gadgets (For the Office Pro)

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=christmas%20gifts%20for%20coworkers)

For the tech-savvy coworker who loves their toys.

*   **Smart Notebook:** A reusable notebook like the Rocketbook lets them write notes, scan them to the cloud, and then wipe the page clean. It's eco-friendly and incredibly cool.
*   **A High-Quality Webcam Cover:** A simple, cheap, and incredibly thoughtful gift that shows you care about their digital privacy.
*   **Cable Management Box:** That jumble of wires under their desk? This is the solution. It's a practical gift that instantly improves the look and feel of any workspace.
*   **Mini Desk Vacuum:** A tiny, USB-powered vacuum is perfect for cleaning up crumbs, eraser shavings, and other desk debris. It's both useful and surprisingly fun.

### ### Funny & Quirky Gifts (For the Right Vibe)

**Important:** Only give these to a coworker you know well and whose sense of humor you understand.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=christmas%20gifts%20for%20coworkers)

*   **A ""Sigh"" Button:** A big, red button that, when pressed, emits a loud, exasperated sigh. The perfect stress-reliever for a tough day.
*   **Funny Socks:** Find a pair with a subtle but witty office-related pun or a cool design they'll love.
*   **A Desktop Punching Bag:** For those days when the printer just won't cooperate. A small, inflatable punching ball can provide some comic relief.

### ### Group Gifts: When You're Pitching In

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=christmas%20gifts%20for%20coworkers)

Going in on a gift with a few other colleagues allows you to get something truly spectacular for your boss or a close-knit teammate.

*   **A High-End Office Chair:** If your team is chipping in for your manager, this is the ultimate gift of comfort and appreciation.
*   **A Nespresso Machine or High-Quality Coffee Maker:** An upgrade that the entire team can enjoy. It's a gift that boosts morale and productivity.
*   **A Subscription Box Tailored to Their Interests:** A food subscription (like Try The World), a coffee subscription, or a book-of-the-month club is a gift that keeps on giving long after the holidays are over.

## What to Avoid Gifting Coworkers: The ""Do Not Buy"" List

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=christmas%20gifts%20for%20coworkers)

Just as important as what to give is what *not* to give. Steer clear of these items to avoid awkwardness.

*   **Anything Overly Personal:** Perfume, cologne, clothing, or jewelry. You don't know their tastes, and it's too intimate for a professional setting.
*   **Cash or Gift Cards (Unless It's the Office Pool):** Giving cash can feel a bit transactional or impersonal. Stick to a physical gift.
*   **Anything Political, Religious, or Controversial:** No exceptions. The goal is to spread cheer, not start a debate.
*   **Joke Gifts That Could Be Offensive:** That ""gag"" gift might not land as you intended. If there's any chance it could be misconstrued, leave it on the shelf.
*   **Self-Help Books:** Unless they specifically asked for one, this can come across as a passive-aggressive criticism.

Look, I’m not great at these posts but here goes.

I’m 23, based near  Chandigarh and in NCR pretty often( also have a rented place and here) I’m looking for something that’s honest from the start—companionship where I take care of experiences, hosting, good times, and you bring yourself without all the games dating apps come with.

**What this looks like:**
I’ll take you out properly. Good restaurants, weekends away if we vibe, or we stay in and I’ll cook something decent while we watch whatever. I’m not rich but I’m comfortable enough to make sure you’re not splitting bills or stressing about money when we’re together.

What I actually want is someone I can talk to. Someone who doesn’t make conversation feel like work. And yeah, if there’s chemistry and we both want it, intimacy too—but only if it happens naturally. I’m not keeping a checklist.

**About me:**
Engineer but I swear I’m not boring. I read a lot (just finished Pride and Prejudice, currently reading some Hungarian novel about a weird marriage). I watch football, I’m decent in the kitchen—make a mean pasta. I like finding good cafés and I’m the type who’ll remember how you take your coffee.

I’m looking for something real, just without the usual dating pressure. No “where is this going” after two weeks. No pretending we both don’t know what this is.

**What I need from you:**

- 18-30, women only
- Actually show up when you say you will
- Be able to take a joke and throw one back
- Discretion at first, but I’m open to this being more if it goes there
- No catfishing. Seriously.

**Why post this:**
Because I’m tired of swiping and texting for weeks just to grab one mediocre coffee where we both know it’s going nowhere. I’d rather be upfront about what I want and find someone who wants the same thing.

If you’re interested, message me. Tell me something you’re into right now and why you’re responding to this. One-word replies get ignored.

Improv is often a grassroots type of art so I am looking for art galleries, coffee shops and even unorthodox locations like a large apartment to do a weekly show. Ideally it will not cost me anything to use the space. While the show being a pay what you want model.

If after a few months of shows  I see their is a real need for improv in New Haven I will look into offering classes and maybe getting a more longterm space. Can't wait to collaborate with you lovely people.

1otfbbc,https://www.reddit.com/r/irishpersonalfinance/comments/1otfbbc/how_weve_changed_our_spending_to_manage_rising/,How we've changed our spending to manage rising costs,"So I earn more money than ever, a wage that would have given us the fanciest life in my parents' time. But now, it barely covers the essentials.

The prices keep rising, so here are some things we did to control costs. Hope it helps:

1. Changed energy supplier every year. We were with Energia, our bills were mental. We kept reading that this was as Ireland has crazy prices for electricity. Yes, but no. It was also as our introductory offer expired and we were getting pure shafted. Bills reduced by almost 50% by moving to Bord Gais. We will move again when coming up to the year with the new provider.
2. I also borrowed a multimeter out and ran some appliances to tell what was using the most juice. Interestingly our washing machine and tumble dryer are modern A rated ones, so they were very good. But our cheap dishwasher was almost as bad as the kettle. Air fryer is 35% more efficient than running the oven. Lights are LED and every light in the house running would cost 24c per day. Showed us what to focus on and run on the night rate!
3. Things that shrink packaging, raise prices - just stop buying them. It doesn't matter. We don't buy Mr Kipling apple pies. They aren't worth it. No more yops. No multipacks of Tayto. No no no. Basically no brand name products in our house. If you look, they are usually a 50% increase in price for a 10% increase in tastiness. Aldi for the win. 
4. Sold the second car. I have a motorbike which I use to get to work, then my wife has the car for the kids and herself. Outside of convenience, we very rarely really need two cars. We saved tax, NCT, maintenance, (crazy) insurance costs, as well as the money for selling the car.
5. Fix everything possible myself. I am an office man but I have been learning to fix things. Youtube (with adblocker, don't pay for that shit - see 6) is amazing for teaching how to fix things. I have repaired my own bikes, motorbikes, lawnmower. Servicing the car myself as well as doing the landscaping work. It takes time at first, but now I can do these things much faster. I borrow from friends or buy tools and equipment on Adverts or Temu. 
6. Cancel ALL subscriptions. You don't need Youtube Premium, Google Music, Netflix etc. Get a dodgy box. If you don't know where to get one, ask your mates, they will know someone who knows someone. UBlock origin means you can watch YT adfree (and all other websites) on a laptop.
7. Don't buy the first edition of anything. Out of season is your friend. What was good enough for people 3 years ago, is good enough for us. Phones, equipment, fashion.
8. Adverts, Donedeal. Buy and sell. When buying offer 25-40% less than asking price. When selling price 20% higher than you want to sell. Not strict rules but generally helpful. Always be prepared to haggle. All our furniture is second hand. We painted some pieces ourselves and it is lovely. We never trade in vehicles and always sell privately (worth 25% more on the sale, but you have to put up with some shite-hawks)
9. Find other ways to make money. I have been carefully buying (occasionally) cars and (frequently) motorbikes, using them for a while, doing them up and selling them on for a profit. I also learned to milk cows, qualified as a taxi driver and have done a few handyman jobs. This is a self-sustaining thing, as when your friends and family see you doing whatever it takes to make enough money for your family, they start recommending opportunities for you.
10. This is the most important one - budgeting. I get paid and immediately transfer the money into different accounts. The Joint account is the only one that is used. We need to cover our month with that money, everything else is saved.

We still get coffees rarely, we still go to the cinema occasionally and eat out about once per month. With these prices, and two kids, holidays are so far still out of the question. 

You may be reading this and thinking ""Jaysus that sounds miserable"" but I can say where we were before was far more miserable.

Two years ago I was laid off for the second time in two years. Already living beyond our means, we had no money saved. My wife was at home looking after our new child and we had no money in the current account, none in our joint account and -€4,569 on the credit card. The kind of jobs I work have long interview processes. I knew I was employable but it would take time. We were selling everything we could on adverts. I was doing jobs for friends, moving stuff, digging, milking cows. 

Here my mindset shifted. I abandoned all notions and focused singularly on providing for my wife and child. The day before I was offered my current job, I was going down to Wexford to do the Safepass and I was planning to rock up on building sites and offer myself as a day laborer. What I learned is that my ego was holding me back. I have 3 degrees and almost 10 years experience in my field, but what use is that when we can’t afford the weekly shop? 

2 years later, I earn the same money again, but we have built up some savings, have no debts (aside from the whopper mortgage) and just had our second child. Life is peachy.

My buddy and I (both 17) have zero experience, and we're both skeptics. He is less convinced that the unseen world exists and surrounds us than I am. No... I didn't drag him with me. Ever since an odd encounter we had in an abandoned small-town house where a murder supposedly happened, we have been much more intrigued by the paranormal, and if there is more to it.

We've been to quite a few abandoned places, but never any haunted ones. Finding a haunted location was particularly tedious, as we live in a random shitstain in the countryside of Denmark.

After some research, I come across a mansion with some lore behind it, and soon after, I found even more information, and bingo, it included a ghost story.  
  
The landowner had a bad reputation as a peasant tormentor. Rumors spread around the village that his spirit wandered around the farm after his death in 1749.   
  
This was perfect for us, I thought. So, I printed out the papers at my local library and made them look old and antique with coffee and candles.

Fast forward to yesterday. At this point, we've known about the place for about 1/2 months.

On the chilly day of the ninth of November, we decided to head out to search the mansion.   
  
The drive wasn't as short as we had wished; it was about 44 miles in the direction of nowhereville.

Our first stop was the church where the landowner was supposedly buried. My friend and I wanted to test my brand new K-II EMF meter at the graveyard.

The moment we stepped out of the car, we met two fellas with headlamps and metal detectors. Kinda odd, but we said hello and continued on foot to the church.

Just before we reached the church, we decided that we should unpack the other piece of 'equipment' that I had brought with us. The Ouija board. Yes... I know some folks, particularly in this sub-reddit have strong opinions about it, but my friend and I are skeptics, remember that.

We awkwardly unboxed it at a dimly lit bus stop with my buddy's car key coming in clutch, decided to skip the church for now, and carried the octagonal-shaped board and planchette with us to the mansion which was about half a mile up the road.

Our hearts first sank when we came across a 'monitored area' sign near the barn at the mansion. We couldn't back out, not now. My friend was pretty freaked out, he kept pointing out the weird 'wind noise', which was really just a plane. So we continued along the road, and after a short while, we stood awe-struck, gazing at the humongous mansion towering above us.

Have any of you played that \*one\* Red Dead Redemption 2 mission? That's how it felt and looked. It was very ominous. 

Before we continued, I tapped my buddy on the shoulder cause I noticed light emitting from a garage inside the barn next to the mansion. We inspected it a bit closer, and there was indeed light inside. 

We forgot about it and moved on. I'm pretty convinced that it was just automatic 24/7 light.

The tall front door of the mansion was locked, but I had read from an anonymous commenter on an urbex website that there was an easy entry point in the yard through a broken window.

Someone had placed a bar stool below the window for even easier access. Entering was a bit awkward, as I was carrying a backpack with tools, and my friend was carrying a large Ouija board.

We made it inside, brushed the dust from the window sill off our leather jackets, and looked around in the first room. To our surprise, it was very empty. Most abandoned places, in our experience, are very messy.

We wanted to search some of the rooms before attempting to contact any spirits. The search was swift. When we found a somewhat secluded room where our flashlights weren't visible from outside, we sat down.

My friend prepared the Ouija board on the musty floor, and I turned on our K-II EMF reader and placed it beside the board.

We were respectful in our tone when we asked questions to the spirits we wanted to contact. However, despite the fact we dearly wanted it, and tried to believe in it, we had zero contact, and there was no activity at all.

The planchette never moved, the meter never blinked, and we heard no odd sounds except for creaking floors, a bird having a stroke outside that sounded like a skinwalker, and maybe a little nervous fart.

After about an hour inside the mansion, my friend insisted he saw some moving lights outside, and then I went to check as well. In disbelief, I peeked through the broken glass in one of the windows, and to my surprise, there was indeed a light moving towards us.

Immediately, we kindly bid the spirits farewell as you're supposed to with a Ouija board, packed up the board, and bolted out to the yard through the window we entered from.

We hadn't even made it to the entrance of the mansion, when suddenly, an incredibly bright light, probably the same one we saw in the window, shone in our direction through the forest thicket to our side. 

At first it looked like a very powerful flashlight moving around quickly. We were extra nervous, as it came from the area with camera surveillance.

My friend panicked, and we ran as if our lives depended on it. He jumped head first into the bushes, and I stood like an idiot in the muddy grass, and was almost exposed by the beams of light that filled the air.

Turned out to be car headlights. The car passed us rather quickly. Did we overreact? Maybe, but we didn't want to risk it all... and we have prior experience with these types of 'run-ins' with folks you don't want to meet at abandoned places...

As soon as the car passed, we made our way to the road and headed back to the car. When we were about to reach the church, we saw another car approach us, and we were completely and utterly exposed in our current position.

Two teens in the middle of a dark road, one with a yellow backpack and the other with a cyan glow-in-the-dark octagonal-shaped demon summoning board. Safe to say we would have been cooked if it was public authority approaching us. Not ideal.

When we saw the car we ran like crazy, took a right at the church, and then I quickly dashed to the bus stop and put down my backpack to seem less suspicious.  
  
We played it suuuper cool once it passed us. Phew.  
  
Just as we thought we were in the clear, my friend noticed the car had a phone number on the back, and he immediately tied that to a surveillance/security vehicle monitoring the area.

""Do we make a run for it?"" he asked, and I absolutely loved the sound of that.  
  
Never in my life have I been so close to what felt like a heart attack inducing sprint.

At last, we had made it to the warm and safe car. Of course, that wasn't the end of it. I forgot that I had put my backpack at the bus stop. My bright yellow backpack with a half-filled bottle of holy water, my credit card, phone and papers. 

I quickly ran over and picked it up, and then we drove home.

Despite our 'unsuccessful' investigation, we don't believe less in the unseen world than we did a week ago.   
  
Him and I are pretty sure that a major reason our devices didn't work, is because the ghost stories were just rumors, and that the mansion isn't actually haunted, not because we didn't have enough faith or didn't believe in it.

Both of us want to believe, and we are committed to scouring every place we find for viable proof.   
  
And also, the dad lore will be absolutely diabolical in a short 20 years.

If any of you have some advice for us rookies, feel free to share your experiences. Thank you.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

1otf8lc,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1otf8lc/32m_still_making_sense_of_life/,32M still making sense of life,"So basically when I was 18, summer after senior year I was all set to go off to college. My younger brother (14) got into weed, and by winter my parents decided to send him off to a boarding school for a year. It worked out for him. He finished high school out there at 16, came home and got into university got his engineering degree. Now he works for a prestigious company with a really good looking resume. I'm so proud of him. 

My mother was very, very immature from an emotional standpoint. She would follow us both around the house nagging, starting arguments, always yelling. I felt from a young age (maybe 9) that I was being raised by an unstable, irrational person that I could not attempt to reason with in anyway. Still to this day she has never admitted wrong doing. I saw my mom as this chaotic, almost cartoonish monster. Like a drill sergeant, or maybe a monkey with two cymbals banging together. My entire childhood was basically me getting home from school and just shutting down in my room or leaving the house and just walking around the neighborhood til it was time to go to bed. She also cooked small portion, lean meals and I grew up very skinny. I got made fun of constantly for how skinny I was. And if I said I was hungry, my mom would laugh. I came to realize later on that it was because she was very insecure about us liking the food she cooked. She wanted us to appreciate exactly what she gave us. 

Anyway as the weed issue arose with my brother, I saw it as just another argument I wanted to disappear from. Because literally all summer my mom and my brother would argue, with my mom being the primary instigator. There were arguments where my mom expected me to take her side, or protect her. I went off to college 1st semester and just wanted to escape. At winter when they sent him off, I made a point that I didn't want to be invested in the situation in anyway. I wanted my own peace, and could not stress about it. My mom snapped back with ""it sounds like you just hate your brother don't you."" It was said in such a disingenuous tone, almost a ""Nana Nana boo boo"" attitude like a child would have. And that right there... ""it sounds like..."" and ""so what you're saying..."" encapsulates everything about the way she challenged my sanity on a daily basis. I think at the time, I had no idea how heavy that accusation would be to deal with. A heavy brick in my backpack so to speak. It was very hurtful, even though I had already accepted well before that that my mother wasn't of any help to me, only hurt, and I would have to ignore her and any success I achieve in life would have to be built far away from her. 

That first year of college naturally was a disaster, and my parents were not understanding at all. My mom actually spoke very negative about me my whole childhood. ""We can't trust you in public..."" ""You never get any work done."" One time I even heard her say ""I'll be surprised if he makes it into college."" She also said ""he has friends?"" once. So basically, I never felt she supported me anyway. I remember looking around my college classes, shocked that there were kids who *wanted* to go home and see their parents on weekends, receive care packages. Etc. I wasn't angry, just sincerely confused. I truly believed my mom didn't believe I could achieve anything.

I would sum it up by saying I grew up in a chaotic environment where it was very hard to maintain confidence in myself or consistently work at anything. 

To top it off, somewhere around the age of 11 this notion that I was an asperger entered the picture. To me, it came across like something to satiate my parents. Like... ""aha! That explains it."" It certainly didn't bring peace to me. And as I got older, the elephant in the room was wait a minute, how do you expect someone to turn out who gets treated that way?  Or...  if you actually think you're raising a child on the spectrum, would it be the right thing to suggest to them that they hate their brother? So I guess I think the asperger thing gives them a label they can settle on that cancels out the need for self-reflection on their part.  Around that age (11 or 12) I was indeed a bad kid. I would terrorize neighbors with pranks. Pick on people. Act out. And basically anything I did was to get a reaction out of people. I wonder why??? I was also very creative. I remember my parents having a piano teacher over. He asked me if I knew any songs. I said yeah, I learned some 50 Cent songs by ear off the radio and played them. The look on this old man's face was priceless, and long story short my brother got the piano lessons instead. In reality, I think I was an epic, powerful individual that my parents had no idea what to do about. I think around this time my parents saw my behavior and kinda said ""oh well, whatever happens happens."" 

My dad, just the sweetest thing ever. Really. But as I get older I understand how patronizing he was of me. In reality, he was committed to his marriage which is admirable. But that meant he had to support my mom at everyone else's expense. One person's emotions ruled the air, mine had to be suppressed. He was kind of a peacemaker, mediator type of guy.  I say again he is a very sweet, loving, patient man. 

When i bring up the statement about hating my brother, my dad has said things like ""she didn't mean it..."" and my mom will defend herself. Excuses, deflections, and my dad speaks to me in a cooing manner. I can't tell if I'm being treated like a person, or a museum piece (I get stuck thinking they have the asperger label in their head, where I'm some type of museum piece with a sign infront of me telling them how to interpret me).. I have a hard time being validated. My dad has said ""we don't believe you hate your brother.""  And of course he has told me to ""take it to God."" 

Basically, I put it to them that we have a mutual inability to take each other seriously. I don't appreciate the accusation that was made against me. It's not my job to respond to it, or have it leaning against me in any way. It's their job to admonish it. I told them that I could take them seriously if they said ""we were wrong, you do not hate your brother."" But say it infront of some other family members. Because plain and simple I don't believe they speak to me seriously, or take me seriously. I believe they bargain with me and try to tell me what they think I want to hear... Patronization. Slowly, as the idea of my mother's ""mental struggles"" enter the conversation, I'm told my mom is just the way she is. My dad will say ""I actually like her... I find her quirky and interesting......"" great. I suppose my anger has shifted towards my dad. I can talk to him the same way... ""yeah you know what I find mom to be just adorable.""  I'm kind of looking at my dad more now, and honestly feeling different about my mom. She struggles in a world of trying to find labels and diagnoses to satisfy herself with herself, much the same way she did with me. I wish she could just be herself. I do find some sympathy now, the way she will adamantly state ""I have depression!"" Like it's an identity she's fiercely clinging to. I have observed some of the Christian principles and they've helped. Namely, forgiveness and ironing out what I can be grateful for. These ideas have indeed helped. I rationalize that my mom is creative, and smart. I told her that too. Still, I can't forget that kick in the back and the lack of understanding.

So what have I done since then? 

I covered a million miles as a OTR truck driver, owned a truck for 4 years. I also managed to knock out an associates degree (engineering) at one point. For a bit I took a break and worked at a hotel, and i liked it. I picked up a badass classic car along the way. My dream car? I have it (still a work in progress but i have it). I also gambled with crypto. I had myself overexposed and even upside down at times, as between the trucking and crypto it was all a very very high risk path to take (Dave Ramsey would have had an aneurysm). Well, I'm standing here right now with a net win that I can accept on a financial level. I'm very happy to reach the point of acceptance. Because in my 20s I was very hard on myself about saving and aggressively investing (and not in traditional forms). I wanted to achieve, badly. I also had all kinds of vices. Weed, porn, sometimes alcohol but not really. I'll be honest. I saw the country sober and I saw it high. Looking back, I'm pretty surprised I made it that far because i drove for some acclaimed outfits in the trucking industry that are very safety oriented. Coffee weed kratom, and some music. That was my jam for quite some time. 

Trucking was a tragedy because while I traveled and made money, I felt I was locked in a rolling jail cell. Tied financially to the truck I owned. Stuck in my own head. Keeping wins and losses close to the vest. I could never explain trucking to normal people (extended family). They think it's all fun and games, and travel. It's actually a very tough life. Also, I never felt my body was in order. My lower half at times felt non-existent. And it would force me to think back to my childhood days of being malnourished and not having energy. It fucked with my mind every day. Seeing other people my age run around and play sports. I would walk several miles everyday, and take weeks off at a time to hike in nature, but it was just tough. I felt like I existed on the fringes of life. I didn't even get along with or think the same way as most truckers. Basically, i didnt think of trucking as the greatest thing since sliced bread like most of them seemed to. I took personal losses on the road too, including a truck of sentimental value that was stolen and I could not get back.

I thought alot about my family and how it felt like I was cursed to be living some different life. Alone and unable to relate to the world outside. There were a lot of things I wanted to work on. But felt I couldn't due to trucking. Ask internet what to do if depressed... ""try getting regular exercise and sleep schedule..."" OK stop right there because I can't even do that. So I basically accepted I would be ""depressed"" until I made it out of trucking. 

I played guitar in the truck and at times could absolutely shred (blues). You would have thought Robert Johnson was in the truck, seriously. Also half decent with FL studio. But between the stress and the unstable nature of the job (counting every dollar like its your last, thinking it could end at any minute if the truck gave out or anything else) I never found it in myself to express myself publicly. I surely never found the ability to play up to my ability infront of any family member. 

Well anyways, I'm standing here at 32 believing I've driven a truck for the last time. I'm ready to undertake first steps in a lot of things. I would like to get back to work on that degree. I'm aiming for a transportation engineering program that has a focus on rail (i was indeed a train kid, my dad used to take me to see trains ok). I would like to continue my music. I actually have a project in my head that I've slowly worked on, whenever I have the creative spirit. If I got to the point it was ""ready"" I truly believe it would be a big deal. The idea of a music album is intriguing, as it would be my answer for all the folks who have suggested I ""write a book"" about my trucking/life experiences. It would be more of a rap album with live instruments (guitars etc) over the beats. 

I'm planning to move to a new town, which is nothing for a traveler like me. I had lived on my own even before trucking. But I'm not gonna tell a soul what I'm doing. 

I still see a lot of ""faults"" in my character. But now free of trucking I see an opportunity to address all of it seriously. 

- self reliant to a fault - I will keep everything to myself. Example, I will commonly walk 10, 15, 20 miles to places rather than calling a friend for a ride.  I have trouble asking for help at a job. When people give verbal instruction I can quickly become overwhelmed and tune out. 
- I have trouble explaining things in detail, expecting people to listen
- sometimes I have a tendency to overshare. Or, share something (especially with relatives) and then think ""man, I must have been in too good of a mood, why did I share that?"" 
- I plan to go back to lock down mode with family, extended family as well. I'm talking I won't be sharing a thing. I think it's the best thing for me right now, because I just can't answer all the ""are you gonna"" and ""why don't you"" questions. Nobody understood my life. They all assumed I was just fine because ""truckers make a lot of money."" They think I have a life and a routine just like they do. I don't know, for all I'm concerned I come from a family of NPCs. I'm fresh out of trucking. There's just too many individual things I have to address. I have to rebuild my entire formula for life and it's going to be a process, and it's all for me. Nobody's gonna know a thing about me. They can ""interpret"" how they like.
- I don't like being patronized and I Detect it where it doesn't even exist. I have a fear people are going to see an ""asperger"" label and treat me differently, in a patronizing ""we love you even though..."" kinda way. How I was treated by family and extended family. I also have a fear I'm going to get excluded or cast aside. Like, I'm going to get into college, and then someone in some office somewhere who doesn't even know me is going to see my name on a computer screen and just scoff and take care of me with a click. I'll get some letter that I've been unenrolled due to some unexplained computer glitch and there's nothing I can do about it. I guess I figure people are going to cast me aside and look to wash their hands of me the way my mom did.
- somewhat on this same point, I struggle to maintain a longterm vision. I never imagine myself actually finishing a goal. Until I actually finish it, I'll be in disbelief. I don't even like to share my goals (with anyone) because I don't want them to ask me about it at a later date. However, I've gotten better and I feel more at peace with the way things are and I hope I can move forward from here with peace, and take things one day at a time at my own pace.
- women - trucking did not lend itself to relationships one bit. And folks would ask me ""so are you gonna get a girlfriend?"" Like, let me figure out where the fuck I live first. I always had ambition beyond trucking, but I couldn't walk about just talking about how I hated my job. Again, nobody understood my life. And perhaps on some level,  maybe due to my relationship with mother, I could not fathom the idea of a woman making an effort to understand me, letting me complete one sentence, sticking by me/believing in me through one struggle. And my life has been so up and down that I really can't see how a woman could have been part of it. It was best for me to traverse these paths alone. The thing is, I remember a time in high school up until 18 where I was very popular with women. I had women around me everywhere. Of course, this was a life I hid from my parents. On some level, I feel I was on a pretty good path and the things that happened kind of sabotaged me in a way. Until that stuff popped off that summer, things were actually coming together. I felt like a normal, not autistic person ready to move forward in life. And then the ground under me became very shaky.
- fears of being judged - commonly, I felt people saw me as a dude always by himself, looks like a kid. Etc.. never imagining the experiences I have or the stories I could tell. I even heard people speculate I was on the spectrum, and my thought was why don't you spend 10 years on the road see how you turn out.
- dislike for inauthentic/simple minded people. I suppose the asperger narrative challenged me not to settle for that label, and dig deeper to look for my ""true self."" I want to be myself with no explanation needed. I've gained an understanding and appreciation of the ""subconscious."" And as far as I'm concerned, all of these labels (autism, ptsd, depression, schizophrenia etc) are different shades of the same thing. The human condition. So my gripe, these days, is not with my parents but more with society as I pretty must detest all of these labels and the way its looked at/treated. I think we live in a society full of people who suppress their subconscious or are afraid of it. Or, they are suppressed by their environoment. Some people (like me, in my family) have to live in a way where we satisfy those around us by having vice grips clamped down on their lips, with rainbows and waterfalls coming out our ears and nose. I had a cousin with schizophrenia, and i think that about explains it. Then everyone else can look and say oh how cute. So many NPCs, clinging to their social status, their consumerism, virtue signaling with their beliefs as a form of identity... and labeling the strong individuals like me that they can't understand. They couldn't handle the trip I've been on in life. Example, the amount of knowledge I've forced myself to gain about the economy after I recklessly dove into crypto. And then, I have to backout and hear that the economy is the way it is because of ""biden"" or ""trump."" And these folks think they're geniuses. I would say I've gone years at times yearning for intelligent conversation with another human.  I know I can learn things in great detail and extract great meaning. 
- I find it hard to find an environment where I can get work done, or stay put for long. At one point, I took some time off trucking and found no place where I could comfortably work on my music. I surely couldn't do it around family, nor any of the rooms I rented (I guess you can't jam out in a house full of people the way you can in a truck). I ended up installing a inverter, power outlets, and speakers in my SUV.... Anyway I think even if I did college again I'd find it very hard to find a ""spot"" where I could be comfortable and get work done without distractions.
- vices - I rarely drink or smoke anymore. I still watch porn but a lot less. I used to collect porn!! Now, I can say truthfully that I slip up and look at porn now and again but I never save it or collect it. I feel a lot less guilt (no counting days, just get it over with and move on) However, I'd like to move on totally. I don't like that I know exactly where all these things are on the internet.Maybe I need an accountability partner. I've also looked into religious ways to look at women without lust, to see their true value. I will say that I give myself credit for not subscribing to the modern dating beliefs about men, women, redpill, etc. I try to just be me and let others make their own excuses. It all sounds to me like a lack of self reflection. I also aspire to do things not out of lustful desires. The classic car I own, for example is NOT to impress women or anyone. I have it because I wanted it and I know everything about it.  I subscribe to the idea that healthy people attract healthy and unhealthy people. I've been unhealthy. In my quest to become more healthy, I want to be strong and in a way so as to not take advantage of other's weakness. 
- I don't share a thing with parents. I mean a thing. If they call (a few times a year), I will say I have nothing to share I'm very sorry, is there anything you all would like to share with me. And they will coo at me some more, thinking one day I will just smile ear to ear and share my life with them. Deep down I feel I had to go at life my own way, and they were not sympathetic to the damage they caused and cannot understand what I dealt with and how hard it's been just to get to where I'm at today.  I still think they think they're just looking at an autistic person. Theyll tell me how ""interesting"" i am. I would like to do best I can to forgive them and respect them best I can. And not be hurtful. Still, I don't feel they give me ownership of any type of feeling or statement, even if I was to tell them something positive.  I guess I hope to appreciate them best I can while they're still here. Being a parent must be hard... idk if I could do it.
- in reality, I'm a very social outgoing person. I think trucking was terrible for me. In the month after I quit trucking, I spent my time hiking in state parks, striking up conversations with strangers with ease. The hotel job came very natural to me. I spent years talking to strangers on the road.

So I have some strong-points, some goals. I also have some serious limitations that I think are related to my childhood and I hope to keep believing, keep working, and one day unlock my full self. With trucking behind me, I think I have a good opportunity and would appreciate any advice. ",1,1762784988.0,CPTSD,1,1.0,False

**Feeling the Midlife Slump? 😩: Rediscovering Purpose Post-40 (It's Easier Than You Think!)**

Remember when weekends felt like endless possibilities and Mondays weren’t a soul-crushing abyss? Yeah, me too. Somewhere between career climbs, kid carpools, and keeping the house from collapsing, our *purpose* can feel… misplaced. Like a sock in the dryer's void. But guess what? It's not gone. It's just time to dust it off.

Hitting 40+ doesn’t mean your best days are behind you – unless you're talking about hangovers. Those *definitely* peaked in your 20s. The great news? It’s totally possible to reignite that spark. How? Think of it as a software update for your soul. 😉

Here's a little reboot guide:

*   **Tiny Tweaks, Big Impact:** Forget grand gestures. Small, consistent changes are the real magic. Maybe it's a 15-minute walk each day, learning a new language on Duolingo, or finally finishing that pottery class you always wanted to try. (Is pottery therapeutic or just another way to create clutter? Asking for a friend... who may or may not have three half-finished ceramic frogs.)
*   **Revisit the ""Old You"":** What lit you up *before* life got so… structured? Did you love writing? Playing an instrument? Helping animals? Dust off those old passions. You might be surprised at what still resonates.
*   **Give Back (It Feels AMAZING):** Seriously, nothing beats that warm fuzzy feeling you get from helping others. Volunteer at a local soup kitchen, mentor a young person, or donate your time to a cause you care about. Plus, karma points are *never* a bad thing.
*   **Financial Freedom Focus:** Ever stop to really think about what you're working for? Freedom is a huge part of finding purpose. You might be richer than you think—find out how much your savings could really fund your retirement. [https://mavely.app.link/e/KY8k65O9EXb](https://mavely.app.link/e/KY8k65O9EXb)
*   **Reconnect (Seriously, Call a Friend):** Human connection is the glue that holds us together. Schedule that coffee date you've been putting off. Call a friend you haven't spoken to in ages. Remember, you are not alone in this journey.

Are we talking a complete life overhaul? Nope. Just a gentle nudge in the direction of awesome. It’s about rediscovering what makes *you* tick. About figuring out what brings joy, not just achievement. About trading ""shoulds"" for ""wants."" It’s all there, waiting to be unearthed.

Just think of the possibilities…

There have been days where I needed to use both hands to lift my coffee cup. There's been a couple days the pain was so bad I had to ask my wife to help me get dressed.

A couple of people on /veteransbenefits mentioned seeing an OT.

Is this something I need to ask my dr for or is it too early? I've had the infantry mindset that I just need to push through the pain, because pain is literally in your head (CNS).

1otf34s,https://www.reddit.com/r/HangDogCityLimits/comments/1otf34s/exerpts_1/,(exerpts 1),"""Computer!"" May says. 



""Yes, Captain?"" The computer speaks in a soothing but no-nonsense female voice. 



""Oh, I like that one."" May says. ""What voice is that?""



""This voice is labeled ""Ship Computer Wife Classic"", Captain.""



""Do you always have to call me 'Captain'?"" May asks.



""Yes, Captain."" The computer says somewhat sarcastically. 



May makes a face. ""Fine, whatever. Can you look up this band, Factory Deal?""





""Misuse of company resources!"" A male voice from behind her. 



May turns around to find Neil jabbing a finger in her face. He’s Falcron’s resident bureaucrat, and seems to have made a hobby of finding reasons to write May up. Doing so has absolutely no effect other than him occasionally receiving memos about excessive paperwork. 



""Oh, blow me."" May says. ""537B, Cornelia Robinson, refuses to clean up after her dog. You can catch her if you hurry, he's five million years old and it takes awhile for him to pop a-""



Neil throws his hands up. ""OK, ok, you don't need to look at the screens. Fine. That still doesn't make watching a show work related.”



“It might be, though.” May says. “You know anything about this ‘Dusty’ character?” 

.....

In her quarters, May pokes the display screen at the bottom of her bunk with a foot. “Hey, you got a discography for Factory Deal?”



“Sure, hun, got that right here for you.” The computer says. 



“Oh, that’s….which voice is that?” May asks. 



“It’s called ‘That One Lady Dontcha Know’.” The computer says. 



May shakes her head. “Play something.”



“This one’s called ‘Lady at the Fuel Stop’, hun.” 



May huffs a laugh. The tune is catchy, but the lyrics leave something to be desired. They’re mostly in Rycacian, with a few common and easily recognizable words and phrases in English- “sexy lady”, “pickup truck”, “pump my gas”. 



“What about something else? They have anything that's not hot chicks and fast cars?” May asks. 



“The title of this song is ‘Roof for Relaxing’, it's very popular, dontcha know.” That One Lady says. 



The lyrics of this one are certainly more interesting, telling a somewhat rambling story in which the band repeatedly receives noise complaints from irritated neighbors which eventually devolve into a feud, riot, and May thinks the universe might explode at the end. 



The door opens and Rahal comes in. “What's that?”



“Your favorite band.” May says. 



“Play a video.” Rahal says. 



“Sure, hun, which one you want?” The computer asks. 



“Do you have one from Blue Star?” May asks. 



“Sure, hun. Here you go.”



Blue Star is on Rycacia, May had picked it because she knew he used to play there. The place has obviously undergone some renovations and updates, but it’s still only big enough for maybe two hundred people. The house lights are on low, even though the stage lights are fully up. Most of the patrons are standing close to the stage. The band is already up there, sans Dusty who comes out fashionably late. He starts talking to the crowd, getting down at the edge of the stage to pass things back and forth. Rahal is listening to his schtik, which is quite entertaining, but May is watching Dusty closely. After awhile, Benni breaks up the socializing and they start playing music. Dusty is dancing around with the mic, getting up close with the other band members, making eye contact and gesturing to the crowd. They’re obviously all just having a good time out there. 



“That looks like fun.” Rahal says. 



“Yeah, little local shows are awesome.” May says. “These ones up here are nice and all, but it’s all on such a tight schedule. Those places, you can just fuck around up there until the owner kicks you out.



They’ve stopped playing, and Dusty is addressing the audience again. “I was down in Hangdog the other day. You guys know where that is?”



May leans forward and frowns. 



A smattering of applause. Dusty points and waves at them. “Hey, y’all! How's your mom n ‘em?” Laughter, someone shouts an answer, more laughter. “Oh, well when they get out the hospital you tell them that's why we don't drink n drive. So I was out there, five million miles from nowhere, cause my dear old Mama lives there.”



The audience makes cooing sounds and he waves them off. “Oh, no, y’all, she ain't that kind of mama. No, no, she’s great though, seriously. Anyway, I was down there and she told me, she said ‘Son, I don’t like your music.” The audience laughs as Dusty arches an eyebrow. “Right? She said ‘Son, I don't like your music but there must be something to it because they play it on the radio here. All. The. Time.” The audience cheers. “And she turned on the radio and goddamn, ‘Road Home’ was on!” He lets the audience react for a few seconds, then talks over them. “And I said, that's just a fluke and she said ‘oh, no, this is *request only*. So if anybody from over there is watching, we appreciate it, guys.”



“You OK, boss?” Rahal asks. 



May doesn’t turn from the screen. “Fine, why?”



“You’ve been kind of…” Rahal hesitates. “Interested in Dusty.”

Deck 12 is lower rent civilian shopping, and designed to look like a street with storefronts. The ceiling is made of video panels, theoretically they’re supposed to show a view of a sky but the powers that be like to play random but aesthetic footage. Right now, it’s a mass of pink jellyfish. A group of people have gathered in front of two businesses, they can hear two female voices shouting at each other, the owners of the two businesses. One is a pet store, the other sells herbal remedies. 



“Arrest her!” The pet store owner screams when she sees the officers. “She’s killing my babies!”



“Ma’am…” May says. 



“She’s crazy!” The other woman shouts. “The smell of imitation chocolate can not poison her dogs!”



“What about the other stuff! It’s toxic to animals! Your tea is killing my fish!” Pet Store lady screams. 



“Are you dumping it in the tank?” Tea Lady retorts. 



“Y’all…” May groans. 



“She has to move!” Pet Store Lady insists. 



“You move!” Tea Lady snaps back. 



“How many of your animals are dead?” May asks. 



“Well, none yet but…” Pet Store Lady admits. 



“And you’ve both been here how long?” May asks. 



“Three years, but…” Pet Shop Lady says. 



“So, you want me to arrest her for not killing your animals for three years?” May asks. “I’m confused.”



“The fumes are bad for them!” Pet Shop Lady says. 



“So, you have veterinary documents for their health issues?” May asks. 



“I don’t sell animals with health issues!” Pet Shop Lady says, affronted. 



“Ah, so you put them down.” May asks. “Do you have the reports on hand, or does Millie still have them down in the morgue?”



“That’s disgusting!” Pet Shop Lady says. “My animals are all in excellent health, I don’t need to have them euthanized.”



“So, there is literally no problem here aside from you don’t like the way it smells.” May says. 



“I’m allergic to-” Pet Shop Lady starts. 



“Stop.” May says. “If you’re having medical issues, go to the hospital. Otherwise, deal with it.”



May turns to Tea Shop Lady. “Do you have anything in there that would hurt her animals?” 



“I suppose coffee isn’t good for them.” Tea Shop Lady says. “But it’s never hurt any of mine.”



“No peppermint oil or anything?” May asks. 



“The Marasats don’t like it.” Tea Shop Lady says. 



“You burn incense?” May asks. 



“Certainly not.” Tea Shop Lady says. 



“Ok, I’m gonna give the two of you a choice. There’s an empty store two blocks down. Either you figure out how to get along here, or one of you is moving. I’m gonna give you a few days to decide between yourselves, but if I hear anything else about this I’m gonna flip a coin and the loser relocates. You don’t like that, I’m gonna ticket both of you for disorderly.” 



The women grudgingly go back into their respective businesses. The crowd seems to agree overall with the tea shop owner, some follow her but none of them go into the pet store. A drone that had been circling flies away in search of something else interesting. 



They get called over to the commercial shuttle area, where May has to explain that a llama is not “carry on” and would at the very least need it’s own ticket. Then to deck 9, where Kevin and Brittany are duking it out yet again. 



“Holy fuck, you guys, just get a divorce!” May shouts as she and Rahal approach. 



This place is supposed to look like a subdivision, which means the houses have individual roofs with the ceiling above them. The video panels here are showing an actual sky right now, a red sunset with golden clouds. Brittany is on the roof, looking very dramatic against the backdrop. 



“Look, baby, I told you, I didn’t let her borrow it, she-” Kevin dodges a shoe. “Stole it.”



“Who stole what?” May asks. 



“Monica took my Roamer.” Kevin says. 



“Did you file a report?” May asks. 



“Not yet, it just happened like twenty minutes ago. That’s why I’m late.” He raises his voice and directs the last part at Brittany. 



“ISTC dispatch, we have a report of an accident. Ship has impacted the station in quadrant 847, no injuries reported. Pilot appears intoxicated.” The voice comes in through May and Rahal’s onboard communication systems. 



May puts a finger against her ear, she doesn’t actually need to but it’s a visual cue she’s on the radio. “Dispatch, can you give me the make and model of that ship and the driver’s name?” 



“DelMade Roamer, model f38. Pilot is Monica Fremmel.” Dispatch responds. 



“Well, she just crashed your ship.” May says to Kevin. 



“Shit, no! I just paid it off!” Kevin wails. 



“Put in a claim with ISTC. They’ll cover stolen vehicles here.” May says. “You can probably get a pretty decent payout if you include pain and suffering. I’ll say you and Brittany both appear distressed.” 



Brittany climbs down from the roof and comes up to comfort her husband. They go back into the house together, May makes a rude hand gesture after they’ve closed the door. 



“You ever just want to smack someone?” May asks. 

...

  
A pigeon flies over and lands on May’s knee. She narrows her eyes at the bird, it stares back at her placidly. 



“What do you think?” May asks. 



“Yolanda!” The pigeon squawks.



“What the fuck is wrong with you.” May shoves the bird and it flaps a few feet away, lands on the bed. 



“Shiver me timbers!” The pigeon grumbles. 



“Try again.” May says. 



“Coo, baby.” The bird says sarcastically. 



“What do you want?” May asks. 



“Do you liiike him?” The pigeon draws the word out mockingly. 



“Go away, I have work to do.” May waves at the bird. 



“You do, don’t you.” The bird puffs up it’s feathers. “He’s quite handsome.”



“He looks like a dog.” May rolls her eyes. 



“Dogs can be handsome.” The pigeon points out. 



“Why do you care?” May asks sharply. 



“I’m just making conversation, sheesh.” The bird ruffles it’s feathers. “Don’t get your panties in a wad.”



“What do you know about him?” May asks. 



“Sometimes, the little one has birdseed in her pockets.” The pigeon says. 



“That’s nice of her.” May says. 



“I’ve seen them naked.” The bird says tauntingly. 



“So have I.” May says. “Point match.”



“I’ve been on stage with them.” The bird says. 



“Ooh, denied, so have I.” May says. 



“I’ve been on him on stage.” The bird leans in. 



May leans in. “Three strikes, you’re out.”



“Hangdog City is without a police force.” The bird says. “They were all chased away by a ghost.”



It takes off and flies into an air vent before May can say anything else. 

...

“What did they want?” Benni asks. 



“It was May, and nothing.” Dusty says. 



Benni and Diesel look at eachother, confused, but the guys obviously know who he’s talking about. 



“Our May?” Vincent says. “What did she want?”



“I’m not sure. She asked if I was dealing drugs or something.” Dusty says. 



“What did you say?” Benni asks. 



“I’m not dealing drugs or something.” Dusty says flatly. “Damn, she looks really good.”



“Oh boy.” Benni rolls her eyes. 



“She does, though. Got that uniform and all ‘Respect My Authority’. It’s hot.” Dusty says. 



“Oh my fucking…that’s that goddam stripper, isn’t it.” Benni groans. 



“Who the what now?” Diesel asks. 



“She wasn’t a…I mean, she did other things.” Dusty says. “Shut up, she’s cute.”



“She’s a bitch.” Benni says. 



“Takes one to know one.” Dusty says.



“Why do you do this to yourself. Why do you do this to us!” Benni shakes her head. 



“Aesthetics.” Dusty says. 



“She’s a cop.” Benni says.



“Oh, come on, anybody who thinks I’m a criminal, raise their hands. Ha, ha.” Dusty knows he was asking for that one. “I’m just saying she looks good, I’m not trying to marry her or something.”

  
.....

  
“Hey, Baby D?” Dusty says in a very sweet tone of voice. 



Diesel looks over at him suspiciously. “What do you want?”



“Can you pull the records on that cop that interviewed me?” Dusty asks. 



Diesel smirks. “Do you liiiike her?”



“I just want to see them” Dusty says. 



“Why?” Diesel asks. 



“I feed you, I clothe you, and this is the thanks I get.” Dusty throws his arms up in the air. 



“Fine, fine, gimmie a second.” Diesel rolls her eyes. “The drone’s can’t magically get up there, you know.”



Dusty gets most of the way through Hotel California, doing the guitar parts acapella, before the drone finally gets back and Diesel waves him silent. The file is the same one Dusty had gotten from the civilian console, but with more images. 



“Oh, come on, you couldn't sweet talk anything else out of them?” Diesel complains.



“She worked at that plant during that day, but she came out with us at night and got up on stage.” Dusty says, scrolling through the pictures. “Come on, she can’t be in that damn uniform 24/7…”



“She’s a singer?” Diesel asks. 



“Well, she can. But no, that’s not what she usually did. There!” Dusty pokes an image, then leans back. “Damn, Cagney and Lacey are lookin good.” 



“Who?” Diesel asks. 



Dusty makes a “tits” motion, then “shakes” them vigorously and starts twirling imaginary nipple tassels. 



“Bullshit.” Diesel says. 



“Nope. Holy fuck, that was-” Dusty bangs his hand on the desk. 



“Gross!” Diesel says loudly. 

...

When May gets back to her quarters later, she finds that a pigeon-pumpkin has built a nest on her bed and is sitting on an assortment of decorative squash. The squashes grow eyes and open beaks when she removes the pumpkin bird, they make an assortment of random traffic sounds. May groans and puts the bird back down, muffling the engines and honking. She pulls the blanket over, giving herself room for her feet down there. 



Rahal comes in, the door should theoretically refuse anyone except May entry but in typical fashion, picks and chooses which rules to follow. She’s got a pumpkin bucket that seems to be full of candy, and a fluffy black bundle secured against her with the other arm. When she gets in, she leans down and opens her arm, letting the furry object tumble to the floor. It’s a round black kitten, as in, literally ball shaped, it’s tiny legs positioned at the very bottom of it’s body so it can bounce around like a partially deflated balloon. 



“Don’t you know black cats are bad luck?” May pats the bed. 



The imitation cat bounces over, the pumpkin bird eyes it suspiciously. A chorus of rude comments in New York accents come from the squash, though they remain hidden. The kitten barks like a dog, May makes a frustrated gesture. There is an eruption of honking, crashing sounds, and angry shouting as the cat ball pounces. May rolls off of the bed, grabs the blanket and pulls the whole mess to the floor. The kitten bounces away, the pumpkin bird somehow manages to take flight and makes a wobbly trajectory toward the air vent. 



“You’re going to get-” May winces as it strikes the vent. “Stuck.” 



The bird struggles for a moment, then desolidifies into a blob and squeezes through. The squash chicks flutter after it, still calling insults down at the cat. 

...

Dusty is sitting on the couch in the common area, watching a show where two female Rycacians go around telling other folks what they should be wearing. Vincent comes in, leans over the back of the couch and wraps his arms around Dusty’s chest. 



“Look at that old goat dressed up as mutton.” He says against Dusty’s cheek. 



“She’s a fashion icon, you know.” Dusty says.



“She’s hideous.” Vincent says. “No style at all.”



“Uh huh.” Dusty says. “Unlike you.”



“I am fashion incarnate.” Vincent comes around and lays down on the couch with his head in Dusty’s lap. 



“I think you’re beautiful.” Dusty laughs and starts grooming him. 



“I’m not strikingly handsome?” Vincent grins. 



“They’d tell you to cut your hair and ditch the leather pants.” Dusty says. 



Vincent gasps. “Sacrilege! How would anybody recognize me? What about you?”



“I think they’d put me in a dress and call it a day.” Dusty says. 



“Ha!” Vincent says. “They’ll tell you everything makes you look short and put you in horizontal stripes.”



“I think I can pull that off.” Dusty nods. 

...

“Hey, you remember Betty the Booty?” Vincent asks. 



Dusty stops moving his hand for a second. “Wow, yeah.”



“Diesel was asking about May earlier.” Vincent says. 



“Betty’s booty was definitely bigger.” Dusty says. “I think she died of crotch rot a few years ago.”



“Ew.” Vincent says. “Diesel said you asked for her records.”



“Betty?” Dusty asks. 



“May, jackass.” Vincent says. 



“Damn girl is always tattling on me.” Dusty rolls his eyes. 



“You should call her.” Vincent says.



“What am I supposed to say, ‘lovely interrogation, let's do it again sometime’?” Dusty asks. 



“Nice shoes, wanna fuck?” Vincent suggests. 



“I’m sure she’s involved with somebody already.” Dusty says. 



“And you know this how?” Vincent asks. 



“I’m not interested.” Dusty says. 



“Sure, OK. Mind if I ask her out, then?” Vincent asks. 



Dusty’s ear twitches and Vincent laughs. “See, you still like her. Come on, you’re gonna be moping around all weird until you do. I can’t deal with that for…when are we going up there next?”



“I’m not moping around.” Dusty says. 



“No, you’re getting your kid to break interstellar law.” Vincent says. “Totally different, sorry, this is a midlife crisis.” 



“Yeah, I’m gonna buy a little red Corvette next.” Dusty says. 



“You couldn’t drive it out here.” Vincent says. 



“I’ll drive it around on the station.” Dusty says. 



“You’ll get arrested.” Vincent says. 



“And then I’ll see May. This is a good plan.” Dusty nods. 



He begins aggressively smoothing Vincent’s mane down, it resists of course. “There’s nothing for it, we’ll have to take it off.”



“Over my dead body.” Vincent says. 



“Well, your corpse will look presentable, anyway.” Dusty says. 

...

“So, what’s the plan? They gonna take us out to a jump station or something?” Rahal asks. 



“You like this band, Rahal?” May asks. 



“Is that a trick question? Are you about to tell me something really gross?” Rahal asks. 



“Lots and lots of people have had sex on that couch.” May points. 



“Gross.” Rahal says. 



“But no, that was a legitimate question.”



“I like the music.” Rahal says. “They seem pretty nice in the interviews.”



“They are.” May says. “And good, because you’re gonna see a lot of them for the next few days.”



“What?” Rahal looks at her blankly. 



“They’re gonna give us a ride to Hangdog.” May says. “We missed our window, anyway, pointless to go back up there just to come right down again, we’d have to charter a ship to get anywhere with a hotel.”



“Oh, ok.” Rahal hesitates. “Is that…is that OK? Can you do that?” 



“Who’s here to stop me?” May asks. “You?”



“But won’t we get in trouble?” Rahal protests. 



“Tell them I kidnapped you and forced you to do my evil bidding, that usually works.” May says. “Ah, going for the Sex Chair, I see, comfy but I’d put your jacket down over it…”



“Is there anything here not covered in body fluids?” Rahal asks. 



“I doubt it.” May says. “They’ve been around awhile, you know, lots of time to sex it up all over.” 

...

“Beautiful.” Walker says. “You’re going to get very wet.”



“Yeah. not sitting up there.” JJ pulls the door to the carriage open. 



“I’m not driving.” Walker says. 



“Yeah, no duh.” JJ says. “You suck.”



“I do not, I drive perfectly well, thank you.” Walker says. 



“Witchy Woman!” JJ slaps the large black horse on the rump. “Take us to that freaky house deal, yeah?” 

...

“I heard she was coming down here, then that she was parked with her boyfriends.” JJ says. “Now, isn’t that just the darndest thing?” 



“Took a wrong turn, I hear.” Walker smiles. 



“Hell of a wrong turn.” JJ says. “She talks to those bloody birds on Falcron, you know.” 



“She talks to everything.” Walker says. “Do they listen?”



“Not really, but they do tell her things.” JJ says. “They get on the transports and go back and forth, you know.”



“That’s more troubling.” Walker says. “Sky rats, particularly of that nature, are not a reliable warning and defense system.”



“Geese.” JJ says.



“Pardon?” Walker blinks at her. 



“Geese are a good warning and defense system.” JJ says. 



“Are you suggesting we fill our stations with waterfowl?” Walker says. “That may cause a bigger issue, my dear, where would they all swim?”



“You could build lakes.” JJ says. “Or big swimming pools. They don’t need a ton of water, they do need grass to eat but you could build a park…”



“What about a donkey?” A voice comes from outside of the carriage, in front. It has a sort of long quality to it, and is shaking as though the owner is jostling back and forth. 



“No livestock on the stations!” JJ shouts. “Y’all poop too much!”



“Build a bigger toilet.” Witchy Woman hollers. 



“Get a smaller ass!” JJ smacks the carriage roof. 



They turn, the wheels slide slightly as they hit a grassy track. They bump up on an access road behind a pasture, the barn doors open to let them in. The horse steps under an automatic device which removes the harness, she’d used a similar one in the parking garage to get into the rig when JJ signaled she was about to leave. 



Witchy Woman would be an extremely intelligent horse, if that’s what she was. She came from a small planet very far away, and had been accidentally rounded up with a group of real horses when she had been trying to figure out if she needed to contact the authorities about some sort of cult. By the time it had all been sorted out, she’d been mistakenly contracted into a gig as an entertainer with a bunch of other random folks. Section had eventually gotten wind of it and shut it down, leading to her, and several of the others, now living here in HangDog. She has agreed to act as transportation for JJ and her friends, out of an obligation to somehow pay her room and board. 



The other occupants of the barn appear to be a small white pony and a large pinkish mule. 



“Oy, there, you’re all wet, then.” Princess, the small white one, shouts. “Told you, I did.”



“I like the rain.” Witchy Woman shakes herself off, making the humans jump back and make shocked noises. “It rained all the time back home.”



“Nasty planet, innit.” Princess says. 



“I like it here.” The pink mule says .



“Pippy likes it.” Witchy Woman says. 



“Pippy has barley for brains.” Princess says. 



“And your ass is full of oatmeal.” Pippy says mildly. 



The humans leave, Witchy Woman can put herself away. 



“Where you been?” Princess asks. “You’re filthy.” 



“Some house they’re all excited about.” Witchy Woman says. “Can’t see why, just looks like a house, to me.”



“You ain’t got their eyes, do ya?” Princes says. “They see things, sometimes, what is really there. Not like you and me, we see, whatsit, sights and smells and stuff. They see the way things is, inside.”



Pippy shifts, her joints crack loudly. “It’s a house they’ve seen before. I’ve seen it before, too, a long time ago, very far away.”



“You seen it, the one here, then?” Princess asks. 



“The kids took me up there awhile back.” Pippy says. 



“In the cart?” Princess flicks his ears into an expression of disbelief. “You don’t fit it.”



“On my back, jackass.” Pippy rolls her head. 



“Ah, right, sorry.” Princes says. “What about it, then?” 



“Like she said, it’s just a house.” Pippy says. 



“Oh, I thought it was going to be some mystery, the way you was talking.” Princess says. 



“They don’t like it when houses move.” Pippy says. “It bothers them deeply.”



“Don’t they move houses, though?” Witchy Woman says. “Didn’t we move that barn last year?”



“Not move like that.” Pippy makes a dismissive head motion. “They get up and move themselves.” 



“Houses don’t walk.” Princess says. 



“Exactly.” Pippy says.  “But sometimes, they do.”



“Like when?” Princess asks. 



“Like when you’re on Earth.” Pippy says. “And the road you’re on is suddenly a different road, or the building changes, or you’re in a whole different place and everything is not the same…like that.”



“Absolute insanity. No wonder they’re all bonkers.” Princess says. 



“Indeed.” Pippy says. “But they do know things.”



Princess eyes the mule with mild suspicion. He had been arrested while engaged in a very profitable enterprise picking the pocket of parents giving their children “free pony rides”. He claims to be royalty from a small, hitherto unknown planet in an out of the way galaxy. When ISTC had attempted to confirm his identity and found only an asteroid field, he had fallen dramatically to his knees, wailing inconsolably, and was eventually shipped off to a “recovery and rehabilitation facility”. Unfortunately, that had consisted of humans ignoring his pleas for mercy, telling him repeatedly to get over himself, and being literally tied to that gigantic mule and dragged around. When he realized his dead weight routine was accomplishing nothing other than turning him various shades of green, orange, or brown depending on where they went, he gave up and grudgingly agreed to cooperate. 



Pippy, on the other hand, is a mule. A real one, born and bred on a small farm in what was, at the time, a largely wild and untamed region of North America. She is one of the unavoidable side effects of mucking about with space-time, and had unexpectedly gained sentience one day and thought ‘I should rather like to see the world'. 



She had turned in her resignation, much to the shock of the farmer, who immediately sent a party of assassins to do away with her. What secret he thought she knew still baffles Pippy, but thankfully cooler heads had intervened in the form of Section. 



She enjoys her job now, she goes all sorts of interesting places and sees all sorts of interesting things. Some of them, like that house, are only interesting to humans, but they get excited and it’s amusing to watch them rush about. 



Pippy happily agrees to go wherever, whenever, the humans ask. This is because, unlike her companions, she has a deep and unshakable faith that absolutely nothing bad could possibly happen to her when they are around. The others attempts to explain otherwise had fallen on long but deaf ears, Pippy was born programmed to trust humans, and there's nothing they can do about it. 

...

“She works with Marasat equipment, doesn’t she?” Walker asks. 



“Yeah.” JJ says. “She can rig it up to accept any input you want, it’s basically like manually making adaptors for everything using mushrooms. Speaking of which-” She stands up and grabs his arm. “You and me, are going to go up stairs, and turn on the mic, and get a recording with this beautiful, beautiful rain falling on the tin roof.” 



“You got a band tucked away somewhere?” Walker sounds doubtful, but stands up. 



“As a matter of fact, I do.” JJ says. 



Walker groans. “JJ, no…” 



“JJ, yes.” She yanks his arm hard and drags him toward the stairs. 



The occupants of the room at the end of the hall look suspiciously like the Brehmen Town Musicians. A donkey, goat, cat, and rather bedraggled black rooster, watching some reality show on the local broadcast. They are not, of course, animals, and none of them came from Earth. They’re a bunch of small time conmen JJ has roped into playing backup via blackmail. Walker finds it best to ignore the way they manage it, it always gives him a migraine, how can a hooved animal play accordion, it just isn’t right. The cat plays saxophone, which somehow seems more natural, and a goat for a drummer hardly seems like a stretch at all. The way that rooster plays the bass always makes Walker feel like he’s watching something extremely private and probably illegal in 16 states.

I run a coffee shop and have always loved the look of using halogen PAR30 75w 3000k light bulbs over the front counter. The light is crisp and seems to make things really 'sparkle'. Our customers comment on how much nicer our lighting is than other shops and I'm convinced it's just the light bulbs! 

Unfortunately, the halogen bulbs are getting really hard to find as they are phased out & discontinued (in the UK at least) so I'm trying to find a suitable replacement - which I think has to be LED. 

  
I'd love any advice or recommendations on potential good brands to try. 

  
Many thanks!

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )
