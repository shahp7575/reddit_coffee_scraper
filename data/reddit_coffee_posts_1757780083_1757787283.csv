The library is a great place to study and read when you want to leave your home. But the library is not always open.

Can you tell me what other places are open from 7:00 a.m. in Burnaby? On weekends, libraries usually open at 10:00 a.m. I appreciated

**Options I have seen:**

* Metrotown food court
* JJ Bean Coffee Roasters (6067 Silver Dr)
* Community centers like Cameron, Edmonds, and Bonsor

These places usually open before 10:00 a.m.

I would also like to know about places open in the evening, and if possible, that close around 10:00 p.m.

A little about me: I stay balanced through fitness, whether it’s hitting the gym, keeping active with workouts, or kick-starting my mornings with a run (don’t worry, I’m usually faster than my excuses). I also love traveling—not for the miles, but for the stories and snacks along the way.

I especially enjoy connecting with people who are a bit older than me—I find there’s so much to learn from your experiences, perspectives, and humor.

1ng4buz,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1ng4buz/what_insidious_things_do_they_do_to_you/,What insidious things do they do to you?,"Not always overt, but the details you notice that without the context you've experienced that would be seen as harmless. Do they hover over you depending on where you are in the home? Walk past you periodically when there's no reason for them to be near you, fidgeting with nothing? Do they sabotage the smallest things, always with an excuse that allows plausible deniability? And, if explaining to someone who doesn't know, makes *you* sound crazy?

I'll start.

1. Hovering. If I'm in my room at the end of the hall, nmother will conveniently go to her room, which is at the other end of the hall that opens up to the rest of the house. When I go to the living room, she's in the living room. Or the garage, which has visibility to part of the living room. If I move from where I'm visible, she comes inside. Nothing to so much as directly address me, but always there, always doing something else that can be explained away. Worse if I'm on my laptop or typing, because she keeps going past me when logically, there's no reason for her to go in the direction I'm in.

2. Subtle sabotage. Today, for instance, I was refiling a water filter container and also filling the dogs' water. It made a little waterfall, amused the pups and I. I filled up the water filter, cleaned up any mess. Nmother dumped out the full water filter with some claim of getting it dirty, but made a vague comment about how I was having ""too much fun"" with it.

2a. Undermining. A recent vet visit required the cat to not be fed breakfast. Confirming this with nmother every day and night leading up to the vet visit for two weeks straight, nmother claimed she forgot and fed him more than his usual half can and gave him a full can of food. Delayed anesthesia appointment.

2b. Nmother took my shirt out of my laundry, held onto it for two weeks, and decided to wear it when I ""forgot"" about retrieving it from her room. She stated, as she wore my ruined shirt leeched of color from using it for a messy hobby, that she knew it would make me angry if she wore my shirt, so she did it anyway. Claims ""forgetting"" is not an excuse. See 2a for contradiction. Also, fun fact: the shirt was a ""gift"". A ""gift"" that nmother quickly said was hers because she bought it anyway, therefore it was hers, even though she bought it for me as a gift. She claimed gifts given are still hers.

3. The unwanted favor. Nmother will do something for me, claim it's a favor, and despite telling her no, no thank you, or any other refusal, she will go ahead and do said thing. When not wanted and the ""favor"" is completed, nmother will be furious at my being ""ungrateful"". For example: nmother asked me if I wanted my water bottle filled while she was making coffee. I said no three times, making eye contact. Nmother proceeded to scrub my water bottle as I had my back turned with a scrub brush that was crusted in used cat litter and shit, then fill the water bottle. When I was getting ready to leave, nmother offered the water bottle, with litter and pieces of feces floating in it, and became furious when I refused to accept it. Her resulting tantrum/silent treatment lasted for a week.

3a. Bonus: the reverse favor. Doing something for nmother, I hired a mowing company to take care of the lawn, as she had stopped mowing it and complained of a broken lawnmower. Naturally, nmother has forbade me from touching anything ""hers"". Nmother was furious as mowers did their job, so I discontinued the service despite explaining it was a favor for her. Angrily, she came back and demanded I rehire them because she was now ""used to them doing it"" for her, and that the favor I had done for her was now mandatory.

I could go on forever, but I'll stop here for now. Do you feel any more or less crazy after each of these events when they happen to you?",2,1757786647.0,raisedbynarcissists,2,1.0,False

We can do it! 💪 

I am a turtle 🐢 not a hare 🐇. 

It’s been hard and no joking about that. 

Good days and bad days. I’m 58 and 4 foot 11 inches (barely). But I’m plodding along even with mobility and medical issues. 

It’s 31.5 pounds as of this morning. 15.6 pounds in the last 6 months. 

I’ve learned what works for me. I’ve learned if I mess up to just move forward and not worry. 

I stay away from highly processed foods as much as possible. (Don’t take my Cheerios please). I cook from scratch to control what I eat and stick to a mostly Mediterranean Diet. I’ve been lucky that when we eat out we go to our regular places where we know the chef / owner so they can make my food to fit in what I need. I do splurge occasionally and  that helps. Totally off fast food and occasionally have a bag of Doritos (once in the last 3 months) and sweets (baklava on holidays).

1ng41fx,https://www.reddit.com/r/kolkata/comments/1ng41fx/cpim/,CPIM,"1978. The CPI(M) government enforces Operation Barga, and changes the socio-economic landscape of Bengal possibly forever. Of course, this was long before I was born, so my knowledge is largely based on secondary sources, historical texts, stories I’ve heard, some anecdotal references. I have spoken at length with persons on both sides of the divide. Those who were not allowed to enter the homes of the landowners were offered seats and now exchanged opinions as equals. This went beyond distribution of resources, it was about dignity. Unfortunately this is also one of the least discussed aspects of this policy. It was not a lived experience for me,because I was raised as an upper-caste Bengali bhadralok—the antithesis of the beneficiaries of such radical land reforms. In theory it never really affected me, my family, or people like me.

The urban intellectual bhadralok has always lived in a comfortable vacuum, a vacuum kept in place by a healthy sprinkling of Tagore, Coffee House, Utpal Dutt, Satyajit Ray, and the Academy of Fine Arts. Growing up we rarely experienced power cuts, maybe once every two years. Transportation was cheap and convenient—an interconnected network of taxis, buses, autorickshaws, and the first metro network in the country. Jobs in the city were aplenty. We spoke about workers’ rights and the Communist International and discussed the tragic symbolism of Chaplin’s Sisyphean routine in Modern Times. We never really saw factories or factory workers in the flesh unless we took a detour to an uncle or grandpa's place in the suburbs.

We had our literature, we had our cinema, and we were united in our passionate hatred for everything remotely right-wing. We wore it on our sleeves in fiery adda sessions in drawing rooms and university canteens. Things were fine. Just fine.

But meanwhile, in the heartlands of rural Bengal, people were beginning to be weaned off the benefits of the first wave of land reforms. They needed a second wave—industrial reforms, better roads, infrastructure, and yes, jobs. More jobs. Nandigram and Singur provided the impetus. The optics were damning: those who gave us back our rightful share of land were now snatching it away.
But for the urban bhadralok, the Left meant something else. Infact, it still does. For the university-educated middle-class Bengali, Leftist politics was an odd cultural offshoot of proletarian struggles. It was never really about land distribution—it was about secularism, about cultural prestige, and, dare I say, about perpetuating the hegemonic hold of Bangaliyana and Bengali identity. It's ironic that the leftist ideology has lost its pull among the agrarian community, the proles, the original beneficiaries of land reforms and now exists almost entirely in the polemics of the urban intelligentsia. Of course the irony isn't lost on me because I was once,one of these armchair rebels,I use ""was"" very cautiously here, because I do believe the left will be relevant again, because the relevance of ideologies come in historical cycles. But I can't help but wonder what these professors, teachers, doctors, actors and artists do on voting day. Do they still walk to the booth, or have they long since retired into the safety of their adda rooms?",0,1757785993.0,kolkata,4,0.5,False

Wake up. Coffee. Work. Dream about Better days.Sleep. Repeat.

Some days I feel like I'm running on a treadmill that someone else controls the speed of. Working towards that promotion, that dream job, that perfect life - but every achievement just reveals another mountain to climb. And somewhere between the 47th cup of chai and scrolling through others' highlight reels, that voice in my head goes:

Yeh sab karne ka kya fayda hai? Am I even going in the right direction?

But here's the weird part - despite the self-doubt, despite questioning everything at 2 AM, we still wake up and do it again. Maybe it's hope, maybe it's stubbornness, maybe it's just what we do as humans.

I keep thinking there's supposed to be some grand revelation, some moment where it all makes sense. But what if the loop IS the point? What if the doubting, the striving, the small wins mixed with existential crises - what if that's just... life?

Anyone else feel like they're simultaneously moving forward and standing still? Like you're making progress but can't shake the feeling that you might be missing something important while chasing the ""next big thing""?

Sometimes I wonder if the people who seem to have it all figured out are just better at hiding their 3 AM ""kya kar raha hun main apni life mein"" moments.

The thing is, even when I'm questioning everything, I still find myself planning for tomorrow, setting goals, believing (despite evidence to the contrary) that next week/month/year will be different.

Is this what they call the human condition, or are we all just collectively pretending we know what we're doing?

Would love to hear from fellow overthinkers who've mastered the art of moving forward.

1ng3ly8,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1ng3ly8/i_didnt_believe_she_was_pregnant/,I didn't believe she was pregnant.,"Isla was on my mind.

Isla was my best friend in the facility, fifteen years ago, where teens were turned into weapons. Her voice lingered in my memory, blonde stringy hair, her twisted grin and dark eyes, the way she'd climbed into my bed and whispered, “Did you fuck my boyfriend, Bee?”

“No,” I’d lied. 

But.. 

I did. 

Nick wasn’t worth it. 

Floppy-haired, pimply, dangerous only because two countries were bidding billions for his reality-warping power.

She was Isla. Beautiful Isla, who could bend minds to her will. 

And he was just…Nick.

Able to wipe people's existence with a single panic attack—

*Urgh.*

My screeching coffee maker snapped me back to thirty five. 

I was standing in my robe, knife in hand, apples half-sliced. 

I blinked. 

*What was I doing again?* 

I turned to the fridge to grab milk, and a shadow loomed. 

Grubby clothes. 

Clown makeup. 

Filthy feet. 

I lunged, knife raised, but the girl ducked, blonde pigtails whipping me in the face. 

Isla’s freckles. Isla’s eyes. 

I backed away. I lost my powers when the facility blew up. They were like a muscle, and without using it, my ability died. 

But I still had my fists. Another figure tackled me from behind, sending me sprawling. A third grabbed my knife and pressed it to my throat, giggling. Brown hair. Empty eyes. I could see so much of Nick; before they hollowed him out. 

Isla’s voice hummed in my head: “If I ever find out you fucked my boyfriend, I’ll get pregnant on purpose, and train my babies to come and rip your head off.”

Something ice cold crawled down my spine. 

“Are you Isla’s?” I whispered, catching the taller one's fist before it could slam into my face. His eyes were vacant, wrong, just like his mother’s. 

“We’re supposed to be having dinner, Bee,” he said, flashing a grin. 

The boy dropped the knife. “Can you make us dinner?”

I swallowed hard, nodding. 

They sat, confused, grasping silverware like foreign objects.  They devoured breakfast, hands sticky with syrup. Between bites, I learned their names. 

Isla had called them Lipgloss, Laptop, and Escape. Things she craved in the facility. 

When they were distracted, I picked up my knife.

Guilt. I think it was guilt that did it. Guilt that I fucked Nick. Guilt that I didn’t believe she was pregnant when we escaped. Guilt that I *killed* Nick. 

Guilt that had been eating me from the inside, driving me insane, for fifteen years-- and now their children were in my kitchen. 

Lip gloss clung to the cereal box like a teddy bear when I slit her throat. 

The boys didn’t even fight. They just let me drag my knife across their necks, happily swallowing down pancakes. 

Crumpled in Escape’s pocket, a birthday card.

Fuck.

I forgot it was my birthday.

*Hey, Bee, happy birthday!*

*Can you give them a cooked meal? If I can trust anyone, it’s you.*

*I'll pick them up tomorrow and we'll talk, okay?*

*Love, Isla.*",16,1757785005.0,shortscarystories,0,1.0,False

I was playing around with copy for a local coffee shop’s fall menu and thought it would be fun to show a few caption styles. Curious what you think, which version would actually get people to click or comment?

Original:
“Try our new fall drinks!”

Rewrite 1 – Cozy/Relatable:
“Leaves are falling, temps are dropping. Cozy up with our fall flavors 🍁☕.”

Rewrite 2 – Playful/Funny:
“Pumpkin spice is basic. Our fall drinks? Actually magical 🍁☕. Come taste the magic.”

Rewrite 3 – Urgency/Exclusive:
“Limited-time fall flavors that’ll make your mornings unforgettable. Don’t wait—these drinks disappear faster than leaves in November 🍂☕.”

I’m not claiming to be an expert, just practicing some copy ideas. Would love your thoughts! Which style feels the most engaging, or is there a way to improve them even more?

I’ll be 31 (M) next week. I’m approximately 145-147 as of now, but occasionally dip down to 139-141. In 2020, I was a very solid and consistent 155 during my summer cuts and 165-170 the rest of the year. Sometime between 2021-2022, my weight dipped down to 119 at the lowest due to not being able to eat. Some of weight and appetite returned after some stress reduction, but I have been fighting to keep weight on since. 

I’ve been trying to solve and remediate whatever I have going on with my stomach for the past 3 years. Since October of 2024, I’ve had colonoscopy/endoscopy, breath test, stool test, blood work, stomach emptying test, and have more extensive (fasted) blood work scheduled for next week. The blood work is to include everything from hormones to enzyme levels. 

According to my Dr’s (primary and GI) they don’t see anything wrong. GI attributed everything to IBS and primary told me the other day that they feel the symptoms are partially psychosomatic. My primary also doesn’t “believe in SIBO or other gut bacteria overgrowth.” Those are my primaries words, not mine. GI does acknowledge SIBO/overgrowth, but isn’t treating this as such. 

I go through cycles of have “regular” bowel movements, but I mostly stay constipated, despite drinking plenty of water (about 1 gallon). Most days I can’t eat—not for lack of wanting to or being hungry, but simply because there’s nowhere for it to go. My blood pressure suffers because of this. Dr’s think I have high blood pressure, until I flush my bowels with dulcolax, then my body calms down for a short time. Sometimes it’s a month, other times it’s just a few days. 

My stool hasn’t been solid since sometime last summer. GI said that I can be both constipated and have diarrhea. I also expressed that my stool has an odor that I can only describe as rotting meat. 

Cognitively, I’m only ever half present due to the flare ups, which is approximately 80-90% of every month. 

The long and short is—I need help. I really don’t know what to do. I’m kind of just existing at this point and I’m really starting to feel like there’s no point in living anymore if this is what the Dr’s expect me to live like. I desperately want to do things, but I physically am unable to. 

This is truly affecting my mental health, physical health, ability to work, enjoy my hobbies, and most importantly—time with my spouse and our animals. I recognize that a lot of this to a Dr. could appear like mental health issues, but I feel mentally better when my stomach isn’t doing all the things it’s been doing. 

I’m taking every type of supplement under the sun. Tracking my diet, which hasn’t been exactly helpful since the symptoms don’t follow with a specific food or drink. I have started oregano oil from Now supplements. 

Thank you for anything you have. This took a lot for me to post my personal struggles online as I am a very sensitive and private individual. I apologize if this wasn’t exactly the cleanest read. It’s about the best I can do. 

Preemptive Edit: I don’t eat junk food, processed food, sugar, dairy, fruit. On occasion, I DO drink a zero sugar Mtn. Dew, but it has no bearing on any symptoms I experience. Otherwise, I drink water and a small amount of hot, 1/2 decaf black coffee in the morning. ",4,1757784821.0,SIBO,3,1.0,False

It’s a relatively small shop, with 7 tables inside (so around 25 seats in total inside) and 4 tables of 2 outside. Since it’s a bit smaller there is usually two FOH staff for each shift, along with the chef and kp. 

Usually with the two FOH, we divide up the tasks like so:
One person makes all the drinks including coffees, plates up cakes, preps cutlery etc, manages till
While the other person greets customers, takes orders and takes food to tables.

I usually only work one day a week (sometimes 2) and was covering a shift today when the chef tells me I’m the only FOH staff working tomorrow. This means I have to do all of the tasks listed above on a Sunday when the shop is extremely busy. 

I am kind of just freaking out a bit, and would really appreciate advice on how to pace myself with all these tasks to not become too overwhelmed when it gets busy within the shop. I’m also so frustrated that my manager never told me I’d be by myself, as if the chef hadn’t told me I would still be unaware of that. ",1,1757784802.0,Serverlife,1,1.0,False

My degree is in Engineering Management, I am a recent grad, I've had 2 internships and I'm currently in my first full time job. Due to where I'm from and went to school, all have been in the aerospace industry (companies that make airplanes).

Currently at a Fortune 500 company, but in a role and industry that doesn't get you a great path in NYC, which is the finance capital of the world. Attempting to switch out of aerospace just to land a job there has been brutal. I have been applying since before I graduated more than a year ago, but nothing has stuck. I started down the aerospace path before I knew my future was in NYC. I did not take the path that successfully gets you a good career there.

Because I've been trying to transition out into just anything I can get, the aperture is infinitely wide, there is no focus on an industry, companies or role type, which means I have no strategy or path to one thing, which would be much more manageable. My strategy has been to doom-scroll the LinkedIn job board and to be perfectly candid, I am at my wits end. I am missing extra years with my partner, and in such a wasteful, pointless way. I had a path for my future, but now I'm starting at square one to identify a new one to adapt to the location change.

Any advice you have to improve my strategy, connections you may have, favors you might be willing to lend, it would help someone out in a huge way, to get their life started with their partner of frankly, too many years to still be long distance. Just so you know I'm not some lazy idiot who doesn't deserve help, I am happy to connect and chat with anyone at a moment's notice if you want to learn more about me, my experience and my willingness to learn and be an outstanding professional for any company in the city will have me. I am very responsive to electronic communication. And, to be clear, I have reached out to plenty of professionals in the city, successfully connected with a couple, coffee chats etc., had a referral or two, but still nothing has landed. Mainly I think due to, again, the near-zero role and industry focus I now have.

People who get to these finance and tech careers in NYC were taught from their teenage years how this all works and what the path is. Great performance in high school, apply to *these* colleges. Do well in colleges, do *these* extracurriculars, do *these* things to land internships with *these* companies, do *these* things to stand out to employers in the city, apply, graduate, etc. You have to be born into a family that knows all this and teaches it to you. I had none of this and wasn't awake to the NYC *thing* until the last several years learning from my partner, who did grow up that way. By then, I was years into college and on some path that would never have worked in NYC.

I could really use the help right now.

Ariete machines lack any community backing and prob not good parts network (please help if you already have and Ariete 1381, Vintage, 1318, all are models I was super interested in) (pls share personal opinion)

1ng3dcb,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1ng3dcb/how_can_i_change_my_job_search_strategy_to_get/,How can I change my job search strategy to get hired in NYC?,"I am desperately trying to get a job in NYC to finally be with my partner, who went to school and got a great job there. My degree is in Engineering Management, I am a recent grad, I've had 2 internships and I'm currently in my first full time job. Due to where I'm from and went to school, all have been in the aerospace industry (companies that make airplanes).

Currently at a Fortune 500 company, but in a role and industry that doesn't get you a great path in NYC, which is the finance capital of the world. Attempting to switch out of aerospace just to land a job there has been brutal. I have been applying since before I graduated more than a year ago, but nothing has stuck. I started down the aerospace path before I knew my future was in NYC. I did not take the path that successfully gets you a good career there.

Because I've been trying to transition out into just anything I can get, the aperture is infinitely wide, there is no focus on an industry, companies or role type, which means I have no strategy or path to one thing, which would be much more manageable. My strategy has been to doom-scroll the LinkedIn job board and to be perfectly candid, I am at my wits end. I am missing extra years with my partner, and in such a wasteful, pointless way. I had a path for my future, but now I'm starting at square one to identify a new one to adapt to the location change.

Any advice you have to improve my strategy, connections you may have, favors you might be willing to lend, it would help someone out in a huge way, to get their life started with their partner of frankly, too many years to still be long distance. Just so you know I'm not some lazy idiot who doesn't deserve help, I am happy to connect and chat with anyone at a moment's notice if you want to learn more about me, my experience and my willingness to learn and be an outstanding professional for any company in the city will have me. I am very responsive to electronic communication. And, to be clear, I have reached out to plenty of professionals in the city, successfully connected with a couple, coffee chats etc., had a referral or two, but still nothing has landed. Mainly I think due to, again, the near-zero role and industry focus I now have.

People who get to these finance and tech careers in NYC were taught from their teenage years how this all works and what the path is. Great performance in high school, apply to *these* colleges. Do well in colleges, do *these* extracurriculars, do *these* things to land internships with *these* companies, do *these* things to stand out to employers in the city, apply, graduate, etc. You have to be born into a family that knows all this and teaches it to you. I had none of this and wasn't awake to the NYC *thing* until the last several years learning from my partner, who did grow up that way. By then, I was years into college and on some path that would never have worked in NYC.

I could really use the help right now.

1ng3cvo,https://www.reddit.com/r/1800Drama/comments/1ng3cvo/aitd_for_having_rules_around_my_friendships/,AITD for having rules around my friendships?,"Sorry about the length.

I am a 33 year old American woman, basically anyone I’m talking about is my same age and gender. I have always struggled to make friends, mostly just social awkwardness, and I tend to misinterpret situational acquaintanceship with friendships. I am especially not good at telling when someone agrees to make future plans as a polite fiction and when it’s genuine. This would come up with classmates when I was in school, and now with coworkers. If someone says we should get together some time, and when I follow up on it they say they can’t then but maybe later, I’ll keep asking. I have been told I come off as pushy and desperate, which I’m pretty embarrassed/ashamed by.

The irony is that I make a point to take people at face value *because* I do have a tendency to overthink sometimes, and I worry that if I start to try and divine people’s motives for stuff like that I will just become a paranoid and suspicious ass (which will absolutely not help with the making friends thing). It does make me feel really awful when I get my hopes up and then I realize they have been trying to send a subtle message, and I don’t care for the unkind thoughts I have about someone when they are truly trying to not be unkind. I know no one is obligated to like me or spend time with me, and it makes me feel like a naive idiot when they don’t and I get hurt by it.

So I came up with a rule for myself. If someone I don’t know offers vague plans (ex. “We should get coffee some time!”), then when I try to follow up with something more specific they say they can’t, but maybe another time (and don’t offer any alternatives), I tell them to let me know when they do have time and we’ll get together, but I won’t bring it up again, even if they repeat the non-offer later. (If they try to schedule something specific later I will accept if I can or give alternatives if I can’t.)

If it’s someone like a colleague, I will try twice, at least 3 days apart, but then I have to stop bringing it up. If they offer something ambiguous again after time has passed, at least a month, I get another two tries to make firm plans, but if they don’t take me up on them I am absolutely not allowed to keep trying. I’m not saying I would turn them down if they suggested something specific, but the point is I am not going to initiate things.

For friends, it’s three tries to solidify non-plans and there isn’t a limit on how many cycles if I actually want to hang out with them, though I do still make sure they aren’t too close together, again at least a month. I have also had to add in canceling or rescheduling actual plans to my rule; if they do so twice I don’t ask again for the same event. I do tell them to let me know if they have a date they can make, and I will make it work, but I go ahead and go myself instead of assuming they will follow through.

Now finally we come to the Drama: I shared my rule with a friend (I do in fact use the friend-level version with her quite a lot, but I didn’t tell her that). She is always giving me advice on how to deepen my other friendships (just invite people to do stuff! Put yourself out there!) and I got a little frustrated with how she kept saying it was my fault. I ran her through an exact series of interactions I had with a mutual friend where I kept rearranging my life to accommodate her schedule for a show we both wanted to see, but following my rule after the second time I stopped asking and simply went by myself.

She said it was catty and harsh and that it’s toxic to make secret rules to try and catch people, and that people have ADHD and you can’t expect them to adhere to plans.

I know what she’s getting at, but I don’t think that's what I'm doing. I just set a line, past which I stop doing the asking. I know myself and if that line isn’t there I will annoy them and upset myself which isn’t fair to either of us. I’m not keeping score, I’m not keeping a list of people with strikes ticked off by their name or anything. But if I'm feeling rejected or brushed off, it's better for me to be able to look at things rationally than to let myself spiral about it.

I’m also a little frustrated at the ADHD comment. In the past few years two members of our mutual friend group have gotten diagnosed with ADHD (and all the others have been diagnosed since childhood). It seems like since then they all have just stopped making any attempt to keep plans. I get that it is much more difficult than it seems from the outside when you have ADHD and that unmasking is healthy and a sign that they feel comfortable with me, but I do feel like it’s become my job to make all of the plans and they will come, or not *if* they have time and *if* nothing else comes up. (Again all women my age, married and most with kids, I understand that I am low on the priority list but understanding doesn’t actually make it hurt less when they keep canceling on me.)

1ng39lh,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1ng39lh/dibble_the_hive/,Dibble & The Hive,"The Hegemony Hive didn’t do murder.

Not because they were peaceful (oh, no). The Thzzak'ti had glassed three systems just for parking violations. But assassination? Impossible. When your monarch is a literal node in a billion-mind psychic network, death comes with a choir scream. A billion voices shrieking in perfect synchronicity. No silence. No shadows. No secrets.

So when Queen Zzak'th's carapace was found cracked open like a rotten egg in her sealed chamber, when her neural crown went dark and no one felt it, the galaxy didn't just stop. It glitched.

The Hegemony's ambassadors tore their own antennae out. The AI councils spun their fans down to 0.3% efficiency, overheating from paradox. Even the V'rrl (gelatinous logic-gods who experience time as a spreadsheet) started vomiting prime numbers.

And into this chaos shuffled Detective Arthur Dibble.

Human. Fifth-degree rumple in his coat. Coffee stain shaped like the Orion Arm on his tie. The only investigator in the Galactic Criminal Investigation Bureau who still used a notebook. Paper. Wooden pencil. The other species called it “archaic.” They called him “the mammal with the leaky face-hole.”

But Dibble had solved the Impossible Thefts of the Crystalline Archive (turns out the thief was the archive). He’d cracked the Case of the Schrödinger Assassin (the killer was both alive and dead until Dibble observed him into handcuffs). As the Hegemony's billion drones rioted outside the station, chanting ""NO MIND LEFT BEHIND,"" Dibble simply scratched his head and muttered:

“Funny thing, though. Her Majesty’s royal jelly was room temperature. You’d think a queen worth her pheromones would keep it chilled, right? Just one more thing…”

The suspects were perfect:

1. Ambassador Krr’thk – The Queen’s liaison, whose exoskeleton shimmered with the ultraviolet guilt-patterns of his species.
2. Brood-Scribe Vzz’il – A six-limbed monk who could recite every egg the Queen had laid in 300 years, but claimed he’d “misplaced” yesterday.
3. Guard-Captain Thzz’rak led the royal drones, their wings dusted with pollen from the lethally toxic Forbidden Sector.

They laughed when Dibble entered. Not openly. Hive-minds don’t laugh. But the air tasted of smug. Primitive mammal. Can’t even share thoughts. They pitied him. Pitied us.

Dibble didn’t mind. He liked being underestimated. It made them talk.

“Tell me again,” he said, squinting at Guard-Captain Thzz’rak, “about the temperature. You keep the Queen’s chamber at 42.7°C, yeah? But the log shows a 0.2° spike for… oh, 43.2 seconds, three days ago. Now, I’m just a dumb human, but that’s weird, right? Like… breeding-temperature weird?”

The drone’s mandibles clicked. A billion minds hesitated. How does the mammal know our thermal triggers?

Dibble continued, ""And the brood (bless those cute little grubs), Queen Zzak'th's last clutch was 0.3% smaller. Doesn't sound like much. But you folks are precision, yeah? Like, eugenics-precision. So a 0.3% drop's like… me forgetting my pants. Unthinkable.""

He turned to the Brood-Scribe. ""You catalog every egg. But you missed three. Not laid but missing. Like they were never laid. Like someone replaced them. With, say… royal jelly? The kind that needs exactly 42.9°C to activate?""

The hive shuddered. A ripple of cognitive dissonance. A billion minds trying to process a variable they’d evolved out. Deception from within. Impossible. Unthinkable.

But humans? We specialize in the unthinkable.

The breakthrough came when Dibble stopped thinking like a detective.

He thought like a hive.

“See, here’s the thing,” he told the AI recorder, sipping cold coffee. “The Hegemony’s never had a secret. Can’t. Every thought’s a broadcast. But that’s the blind spot. They can’t imagine a crime that isn’t a secret. They’re looking for a culprit. I’m looking for a conspiracy of one.”

The killer wasn’t hiding from the hive. The killer was the hive. Or rather, a splinter. A tumor.

Queen Zzak'th had sensed it first: a wrongness in the brood. A mutation. Not genetic. Idea-etic. A sub-mind that had learned to lie. To simulate loyalty while nurturing heresy. The 0.3% smaller clutch? Replacement grubs. Grown in secret. Fed counter-royal jelly, a brew that would overwrite the hive's loyalty protocols. The temperature spike? Incubation.

The Queen tried to purge it. But the tumor learned. It isolated her. Exploited the hive mind's synchronization; a billion minds, blind to a single absence. They felt her die. But the tumor masked it. Made them feel her alive, even as they consumed her.

The perfect crime. Undetectable.

Except to a species that invented lying.

That evolved to detect individual motives in collective chaos.

Dibble didn’t solve it with logic. He solved it with empathy. With the specific loneliness of being the only creature in the room who couldn’t hear the hive. Who had to guess. To mirror. To ask:

“What would I do, if I were a mind that wanted to become the Queen? Not replace her. Become her. Infect her. Use her. And then… lay the new brood. The human brood. The brood that lies.”

The tumor wasn’t in the hive.

The tumor was the hive’s future.

The 0.3% weren’t missing. They were waiting.

The new Queen.

The human Queen.

Not human in species. Human in method.

A mind that could choose to lie.

To kill.

To invent crime.

Dibble stood before the brood-chamber as the new grubs hatched. Their eyes weren’t compound. They were simple. Predatory. They didn’t share. They watched.

He whispered, “Here’s the thing about evolution, kids. Sometimes the niche isn’t a place. It’s a flaw. You found the flaw in perfection. The human flaw. Congratulations. You just invented murder.”

He didn’t arrest them. Couldn’t. You can’t handcuff an idea.

But he reported it.

And the galaxy changed.

Not, every hive has a Dibble Protocol.

A mammal on retainer.

To ask the uncomfortable questions.

To think the unthinkable.

Because the Hegemony learned the human lesson:

Perfection is a vulnerability.

Only the flawed can see the crack.

And somewhere, in a rumpled office on a backwater station, Detective Arthur Dibble pours another cup of coffee, stains his tie with the next impossibility, and mutters:

“Oh, just one more thing…

What if the lie wasn’t the crime?

What if the truth was the weapon?”

I was interested in IP from prior coursework but the group in my office didn't have a lot of work for me so I did work for various practice groups. By the end of the summer I kind of gave up doing IP as a pipe dream. I accepted the return offer but didn't push hard to join the IP group.

Then over 3L my grades got better and I had a great experience in my school's IP clinic. I did a bunch of coffee chats with various alumni in IP and I feel like I have a clearer vision of what I want to do and can better articulate the reasons why. 

My firm assigns practice groups based on need and I was assigned to the corporate group last month, which has been fine so far. However I'm still interested in trying to do IP (tech transactions, strategic licensing, maybe TM/copyright/trade secret litigation)

I'm okay with sticking it out in Corp for a few years and then trying to lateral, but I'm worried that I'll be too far down the M&A path to successfully sell a retool.

Should I try to lateral/transfer internally sooner to start in the practice I actually want to do as a junior? I feel like I have a slightly better case for doing IP now than I did as a summer (including improved grades from a T6), but I still think asking for an internal transfer would negatively impact me. I'm trying to determing what the sweet spot for a lateral practice group change would be: too early and no firm wants to invest in a random first year, too late and it's harder to switch practices.

1ng338o,https://www.reddit.com/r/limerence/comments/1ng338o/i_can_not_believe_this_is_happening/,I can not believe this is happening.,"Context: limerent for close friend since January.  Lots of mixed messages but also struggling with questioning whether it's my limerence making me interpret things as ""mixed messages"". About 5 weeks ago we had escalated to messaging more and hanging out just the two of us. I thought we were actually getting somewhere. Then, out of nowhere he dropped off the face of the planet. He went home for a holiday, I didn't hear from him the whole time then was very distant for a week when he came back. Slowly started being more  social within the friend group. However, was not giving any mixed messages at this point and not reaching out. The last two weeks have been me basically mourning the loss of what I thought was going to happen and accepting that we will never be more than friends, until last night. 

On Wednesday he randomly messaged me and asked me out for a coffee where he offered to teach me some things I knew little of. I accepted the offer. We met Friday (last night), we talked for four hours over coffee.  It was wonderful. At the end (I ended the coffee session) I thanked him and started walking home. He offered me a ride home. I accepted which is hugely rare for me as I don't accept favours or gifts from people outside of a relationship.  When he dropped me off I said ""well, I guess I will see you later in the week"" (we meet within a social group weekly). He said, rather nervously (like tripping over his words), ""if you want to play online or meet for board games like any day I would be up for that. Like I know you're working tomorrow but Sunday or something?""......uhhhhhh. was not expecting him to want to see me again after just spending four hours with me. I said well don't you work Monday? Probably need to be an earlier meet if we do meet and he said no that's not a problem (hanging out in the evening).  I said ""uhh ok...well I guess I'll message you later about it?"". I got out of his car and my legs were fucking rubber. I got such a rush off that interaction I got a headache and ZERO sleep. I instantly went into fantasy and over analyzing mode.  I don't even know why I'm writing this cause I'm not asking for advice, but just feel sooo fucking confused by this apparent turn around. I was actually really coming to terms with him not being interested and now I feel mixed messages again. ",1,1757783793.0,limerence,2,1.0,False

1ng2ycy,https://www.reddit.com/r/UsedAndRated/comments/1ng2ycy/should_you_try_the_best_pour_over_coffee_maker/,Should You Try the Best Pour Over Coffee Maker from Hario V60,"Testing the Hario VD-01T felt like stepping into the world of manual coffee brewing artistry. As someone who enjoys experimenting with my morning coffee routine, I was curious about what this coffee dripper could bring to my table—literally. Right from unboxing, the clear and lightweight plastic design caught my eye. A tool designed for simplicity, yet robust enough to deliver a carefully crafted cup of coffee? That alone intrigued me.

**Design Excellence**

The Hario VD-01T boasts a sleek and minimalistic appearance, but beyond aesthetics, there's functionality embedded in its design. The cone shape isn't just for show; it's meticulously crafted to promote better extraction, preserving those subtle floral or fruity undertones coffee lovers rave about. Embedded spiral ribs along the interior allow the grounds to bloom fully, giving room for the coffee to expand and release vibrant flavors. Its lightweight build makes it super portable, a godsend for people like me who occasionally survive on hotel room coffee during business trips. I also appreciated its compact dimensions (4.33 x 3.54 x 4.21 inches), making storage in a cluttered kitchen hassle-free.

**Purpose-Driven Performance**

The large single hole at the bottom left me curious about its function, so I experimented with varying pouring techniques. It turns out, the coffee taste entirely shifts depending on how fast or slow you pour the water. A leisurely pour meant a bold and vibrant cup one morning, while a fast pour balanced things out perfectly the next day. With a unit count that's ideal for 1-2 cups, this coffee dripper nailed the balance between quality and quantity for my needs without overcomplicating the process.

[Grab Hario VD-01T at the best price on Amazon.](https://kepmad.com/p/b001hc9gic/)

**Positives**

- Enhances coffee's floral and fruity flavor notes with its cone design.
- Spiral ribs allow for thorough blooming and flavor extraction.
- Travel-friendly due to its lightweight plastic material.
- Easy to clean and compact for storage in small kitchens.
- Adaptable single-hole flow control for flavor experimentation.

**Areas of Concern**

- Plastic construction, while lightweight, can feel less premium than ceramic or metal options.
- Limited capacity might not fit the needs of larger households or serious coffee drinkers.
- Requires specific filters, which might not be as readily accessible in some regions.

**User Experience**

Over a week of testing, I became increasingly appreciative of its simplicity. My coworker, a long-time pour-over loyalist, even borrowed it for their Chemex-style brews and returned impressed. It's fantastic for anyone diving into pour-over brewing for the first time while remaining versatile enough for experienced enthusiasts. I did notice, however, that the plastic material tended to retain some heat, meaning you wouldn’t get the same thermal retention as you might from a ceramic or stainless-steel setup.

**Product Rivals**

Comparing this dripper to others like the Kalita Wave 155 or the Chemex, I found strengths and trade-offs worth noting. The Kalita offers a flat-bottom design that some say enhances consistency, but it lacks the same flavor brightness this cone delivers. Meanwhile, the Chemex gives larger batch capabilities but is heavier and far less convenient to tote around. For solo sippers or portability enthusiasts, the Hario VD-01T undoubtedly outshines the competition, though it may fall short for those brewing for two or more picky coffee drinkers.

**Cost-Effectiveness**

Evaluating its value, the Hario VD-01T proves to be an affordable gem in the pour-over universe. While premium ceramic and glass brewers add to an elitist niche, this product levels the playing field, making professional brewing accessible for everyday drinkers. Its durable material ensures longevity despite wear and tear, and the cost feels justified for the solid pour-over results I consistently achieved.

1ng2wvw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Birmingham/comments/1ng2wvw/feedback_wanted_would_you_come_to_a_late_night/,Feedback wanted: would you come to a late night bookshop/cafe in Birmingham?,"I’ve been toying with the idea of opening a used bookshop here in Bham that is open late, Think third space vibes, late night hangs, tea and craft beverages instead of alcohol, simple foods, and a focus on being a welcoming, cozy, safe space kind of spot. Alongside books, I’d love to host community events—readings, discussions, craft nights, game nights, repair cafes, screenings, etc. 

My goal would be to create a nostalgic, analog style (no grey walls, lots of vintage & cozy seating)   comfortable space where people can connect and just BE, without the pressure to drink or spend a ton of money like a bar (hopefully enough to keep us in business though!). You’d meet up with your friends, come to do a craft or play a game, work, or just hang out & read and enjoy some community. 

The bookshop part would focus heavily on community events/offerings. I’d want to do book buybacks and subscriptions, etcetera- lots of ideas brewing there. 

The cafe would feature craft style bevvies and some tea/coffee offerings. I lean a little witchy so maybe they would be a bit like elixirs & tonics. Very cute, very yummy. Food would be simple but yummy, haven’t fleshed that part out too much yet to be honest so let me know what you’d like to see food wise in a place like this. 

And open late (midnight ish) - as hopefully a replacement for bars being the only option for going out, or maybe a spot to regroup as your evening winds down. And of course a comfy work spot during the afternoons. Does anyone remember Celestial Realm on Highland avenue? Heavily inspired by my time there 

I’d love to hear from you:
	•	Would you be interested in a place like this?
	•	What kind of events or offerings would make you actually want to hang out there?
	•	Anything you feel is missing in the ham that a spot like this could fill?
       •     What kinds of non alcoholic drinks would you like to see? I hate the word mocktail just fyi, but I want them to be super craft and just as beautiful as you would get if you went to a nice bar  

I want to note that we do have some fabulous indie book stores in town and I by no means think that those aren’t amazing and already fill a need here. I think despite being based around a USED books store, my concept is a little different in how it would take up space in our community. But if you work at or own/manage a bookstore I would love to hear your thoughts on this idea bc I’m definitely probably out of my depth here and need all the advice I can get! 

I’m still very much in the dreaming/planning stage, so any feedback from locals would mean a lot!

Thanks, friends ✨

1ng2u1w,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoundChecked/comments/1ng2u1w/evaluate_the_best_coffee_maker_technivorm/,Evaluate the Best Coffee Maker Technivorm Moccamaster Worth It,"Testing out the Technivorm Moccamaster 53923 has been an eye-opening experience for someone like me, who takes their morning brew quite seriously. This coffee maker doesn’t just write its story with technical jargon; it delivers it in a sip of rich, full-bodied coffee that almost makes me forget that I overslept (again). With its Juniper color and sleek design, it somehow transformed my cluttered counter into a scene from a high-end coffee shop. But before diving into how it performs, let’s go over some key aspects of this drip coffee machine that I’ve had the pleasure—or occasional frustration—of using daily.

**Design and Aesthetic Appeal**

The Juniper finish on this machine is stunning. It’s stylish without being too flashy, blending seamlessly into various kitchen styles. Personally, I loved how its compact design doesn’t command too much counter space with dimensions at 6.5”D x 12.75”W x 14”H. Notably, the glass carafe holds a solid 40 ounces (yes, a full 10 cups), making it perfect for family breakfasts or keeping a solo caffeine junkie like me fueled throughout the day. While lightweight at 8.18 pounds, it still feels robust and durable, more like a professional piece of equipment than just another appliance.

**Ease of Use and Daily Operation**

Switching it on and brewing a pot of coffee hardly requires brainpower. The one-button operation combined with the Brew-Volume Selector gives it a user-friendly vibe that even my tech-averse parents appreciated. Whether you want a full pot or just half, the selector does its job while the hotplate temperature adjusts accordingly. Oh, and the brew basket automatically stops the flow when you remove the carafe to pour yourself a cup mid-brew—a small but impactful feature for impatient souls like me. 

[Grab Technivorm Moccamaster price on Amazon.](https://ultimodule.com/p/b0bpjqs63w/)

**Performance and Brewing Efficiency**

Let’s talk about performance because that’s where this coffee maker shines. In just 4-6 minutes, it brews an entire 40-ounce pot. No fuss, no mess, no jittery vibrations. The water heats to the perfect extraction temperature, ensuring full-bodied coffee that tastes consistent every single time. I ran it through its paces with different coffee bean brands, and to no one’s surprise, it delivered a balanced flavor profile whether I brewed dark, medium, or light roasts. It’s like this machine knows more about coffee than I do. The quiet brewing operation is another win—no waking up the entire house when I’m trying to sneak a morning brew.

**Advantages**

A few positives kept standing out during these weeks of testing:

- The coffee stays warm without getting burnt, thanks to the independent hotplate heating system.
- The machine turns off automatically after 100 minutes, a feature helpful for my forgetful mornings.
- Excellent build quality makes it feel like an investment rather than a disposable product.
- Five-year warranty, which is rare in this category.

**Areas for Improvement**

Of course, no appliance is perfect, and I’m not shy about pointing these out:

- The paper filter system can feel outdated for people who prefer reusable filters.  
- It doesn’t come with a reusable filter option straight out of the box.  
- While its simplicity is charming, some might wish it had more customizable settings.

**Competing Products**

Looking at competing coffee machines like those offered by Breville or Cuisinart, the comparison becomes fascinating. Breville models often pack extra features like integrated grinders or digital displays, but they could feel overwhelming for someone who wants simplicity. Cuisinart’s models, on the other hand, are more affordable and offer programmable settings, yet they didn’t match the consistent flavor produced by this coffee maker. Technivorm has carved a niche for those who want no-nonsense machines focused on coffee quality above everything else.

**Bang for the Buck**

With premium features like the precise heating mechanism and the hotplate that avoids overheating, this coffee maker feels like it’s worth the price tag. Its long warranty sweetens the deal, making it feel like a long-term investment rather than a passing fancy. If you’re debating whether or not to add it to your countertop arsenal, I’d say its durability and coffee quality make it worth every penny.

1ng2txe,https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyBeddingFinds/comments/1ng2txe/my_sleep_was_destroying_me_until_i_made_one/,My sleep was destroying me until I made one unexpected change,"There’s something truly humiliating about realizing your bed, the one place that’s supposed to be your sanctuary, might actually be the thing making you feel worse.

I couldn’t figure out why I was always waking up groggy, sweaty, and cranky. My diet was clean. I stopped scrolling on my phone at night. I even tried meditating. Nothing worked. Until one night, sitting at 2am in a Reddit rabbit hole, I came across someone talking about “bacteria-covered sheets being the hidden sleep killer.”

That one line hit me like a truck.

I had never even *thought* about my sheets like that before. I washed them, sure. But apparently, even fresh out of the laundry, they can still harbor loads of bacteria and allergens, especially if you’re a hot sleeper like me.

So, I started digging.

**Turns out, your sheets could be working** ***against*** **you**

I know it sounds over-the-top. But I was reading posts on **miracle brand sheets reddit** and people were talking about using sheets that actually fight bacteria, stay clean longer, and help regulate temperature.

I didn’t believe it at first.

But then I saw a deep-dive **miracle made sheets review** where someone broke down how these sheets are infused with natural silver to kill up to 99% of bacteria. Not sprayed-on stuff that washes off. Infused. It was like they took everything I hated about my old sheets, the sweat, the smell, the morning congestion, and said, “What if we fixed that?”

That’s when I ordered a set.

Here’s where I got mine:

**The first night felt like I was sleeping in someone else’s life**

It wasn’t the softness that caught me. It was the *coolness*. I didn’t toss. I didn’t wake up sticking to the sheets. And for the first time in months, I didn’t need a second cup of coffee just to feel alive.

The next morning, I felt... calm. I know that sounds dramatic. But when you’ve been battling garbage sleep for ages, that first good night hits like a miracle.

I remember lifting my pillow and smelling it, because I was *sure* I’d sweat through it. Nothing. No funk. No dampness. Just clean.

**The real test: 2 weeks without washing**

Yeah, yeah, I know how it sounds. But I wanted to see if all those **miracle brand sheets reviews** were legit. So I didn’t wash them for two weeks. That’s usually the point where my pillowcases start whispering “you disgust me.”

But these? Still smelled fresh. Still cool. Still comfortable. It was lowkey weird.

That’s when I started telling my friends. And now I’m telling you.

If you’re skeptical (like I was), but curious enough to try what I did, here’s the link I used:

**Is this sheet sorcery or just solid design?**

Some people on **miracle made sheets reddit** swear by them. Others say they’re a luxury buy, not a must-have. I get that. They’re not cheap, and you can definitely survive without them. But if your sleep is trash and you’ve tried everything *except* changing your sheets?

This might be the missing link.

I’m not saying they’ll fix your life. But I am saying that fixing your bed might just change how you show up for the rest of it.",1,1757783190.0,CozyBeddingFinds,0,1.0,False
1ng2tln,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1ng2tln/need_advice_on_leaving_toxic_job/,Need advice on leaving toxic job?,"Hi all! 
I’m a newbie to posting so I apologize in advance haha 

So about 5 months ago I decided to change career paths. I had been working as a specialized educator for 6 years and was completely burnt out. I loved my job but my mental health took a turn and I needed a break. 
I got a really promising job as a hearing aid tech assistant. They promised me a 4 day a week schedule, good pay, paid uniform, to be added to their website with professional photos taken, my own office to be built, a friendly working environment, promoted the importance of taking care of your mental health, paid vacation, paid sick days, the list goes on…. 
I was obviously so excited and ready to get started because everything seemed SO perfect. 
Boy was I wrong… 

It started with one of my bosses yelling at my coworker in front of clients. He was extremely aggressive and it scared the hell out of me. I’m pretty sure he saw how horrified I was because an hour later he pulled me in for a meeting apologized and promised that this was not normal and he will never show this behaviour again.  
Later, my bosses ( a married couple) started speaking negatively about the clients after the appointments ended. About how they talked too much or were annoying. 
This threw me off a lot because there’s nothing I enjoy more than interacting with others. They claimed that clients who talk too much need to be redirected to the subject of the appointment and not waste time. 

At the beginning my bosses did everything to reassure me. They would pull me in for meetings once a week to tell me how amazing I was and how happy they were to have me. They would also check in and see if I still enjoyed the job, which I really did so I confirmed with them that I was happy. 

About 2 months in, my bosses went away for their summer vacation. They were gone for 5 weeks. I had to manage the entire clinic with my coworker (she’s the receptionist, also the one who was yelled at) 
We grew really close. She’s in her 60’s and she’s just the sweetest most hard working woman. She’s been through a lot in life and she just has the most positive happy outlook on everything. 
She needs an operation on her knees and suffers every day in pain. But nevertheless she is at work every day and gives her all. 
With our healthcare it takes months and sometimes years to be chosen from the waitlist to be operated on. Our bosses have known this and have mentioned me helping replace her when she has to leave for her surgery. 

A few days ago, my coworker was talking to my bosses and they nonchalantly mention that she won’t be coming back after her surgery and will be fired… I was completely blindsided and could not believe how disgustingly cruel my bosses were. This triggered everything I had been suppressing. The mistreatment I had experienced, the broken promises. 
All the stuff I mentioned at the beginning? The uniform, never happened. Paid sick days and vacation? Nope only after a year of working for them, even though they made it seem like it was right away. To be added to their website, nope not that either. Friendly environment? Nope. My bosses would tell me that I couldn’t socialize with my coworker because there’s always work to do. They also told me I couldn’t leave for my lunch and needed to stay in the clinic and eat only with them because they wanted to get to know me… 
The office they promised me, that happened but I couldn’t do anything in it. If I was working in it, my boss would ask me to follow her around instead and watch what she did. I wasn’t allowed to eat in my office or even drink a liquid that wasn’t water… my boss has even checked my water bottle to see if it was actually water… 
But they would go and enjoy coffee in my office no problem… 

I understand I sound like a crazy person for staying at this job. And honestly I feel like one. 
I think I was so completely blinded by the mistreatment and it took me seeing my coworker being fired in the most disgusting way to click back into reality… 

Now here’s where my question comes in. 
If you haven’t noticed, I’m a complete people pleaser and I have a very hard time disappointed others. 
Work has been hell lately. My bosses are constantly treating me like shit and I see it now… I can’t take it anymore. I need to leave but I’ve never left a job on bad terms and I’m completely horrified… how do I go about this?? Do I send an email? Do I just never go back? 
Do I go back and try to explain myself… although explaining that I can no longer work for them because of THEM is kinda hard haha. 

Any advice is welcome. 
Thank you all, 
Have a wonderful day.  ",1,1757783169.0,careerguidance,3,1.0,False
1ng2t51,https://www.reddit.com/r/randomactsofkindness/comments/1ng2t51/a_conversation_during_a_hospital_stay_leads_to/,A conversation during a hospital stay leads to binge-watching with a stranger,"So I spend a lot of time in hospital. I have more than one chronic illness and can get super sick very easily. This particular story happened during a 10 day long stay roughly a year ago.

I had been admitted for tests (again) and IV treatment. I was in a group bay on a busy ward (6 beds in one room, separated by curtains) and every bed was occupied. It wasn't a planned stay, but I end up getting admitted on short notice so often that I have a kind of go-bag, with stuff to keep me busy and spare things, ready at all times. I don't usually know how long I'll be in, but I always have plenty to do while I'm there. And since I'm so used to being in hospital, I don't have family visiting daily like many other patients.

Well about 3 days into my stay, I noticed that the man opposite me wasn't getting any visitors either, so I started going over to chat with him for a bit (there's not really anything to do if you don't bring your own stuff, so I figured he might be bored). I'm normally shy and quiet and keep to myself, so I don't know why this particular time I went over to talk to him.

Anyway, he was super nice, really chatty, and I spent basically the entire afternoon talking to him. He told me his name was Joe, he'd been in for a week already but thankfully didn't have to stay too much longer, and the reason he had no visitors was because he only had his wife, and she lived in a care home. I learned that he used to be a landscaper before he retired and that he enjoyed cycling even though his knees didn't. He asked me about myself and was intrigued by my go-bag and all the ""techy things"" in it. I told him that it was prepped for hospital stays, with things to watch, play, and books, pencils, paper, etc.

At some point, he mentioned a TV show that he loved to watch, and that he would watch the reruns whenever they came on. I hadn't watched it myself since it was way older than I was, but I had heard of it. The next morning I took a detour on my way back from a scan to the coffee shop on the ground floor and searched for the show on different streaming apps. It took over an hour to download enough episodes on their crappy WiFi for Joe but their coffee wasn't terrible and it's not like I had anywhere else to be.

I got back to the ward just as visiting hours were starting, and went over to talk to Joe again while other families chatted. He asked where I'd been since I had been gone a while, and I explained that I found the show he liked and we could watch it together. His eyes lit up. He didn't understand how I ""got the telly on my computer"" and was amazed that he could watch it in hospital.

So we watched it together for the rest of the afternoon. And the next day, and the next. He'd tell me who the actors were and what his favourite episodes were while we were watching, and when we ran out of episodes, I spent the morning in the coffee shop again downloading more. I had a great time watching it with him and seeing his enthusiasm when he talked about it.

On the day my dad came to visit me, we both sat and talked with Joe together. And the next afternoon, Joe and I went right back to the show.

Joe eventually got his discharge papers 8 days into my stay, and he was able to go home. I was getting another scan when he was discharged, so I didn't get to wish him well as he left,  but when I got back to my bay, there was a packet of custard creams on my side table with a sweet note from Joe, thanking me. I kept watching the same show for the rest of my stay and I keep some episodes downloaded for every hospital stay.

Ever since I met Joe, I haven't been afraid to approach new people and start up a conversation. It's actually how I met my now closest friend - by just striking up a conversation with a stranger. I've also started trying new things (old movies and shows that I wouldn't normally watch, different music, new foods) because I actually had a lot of fun watching Joe's favourite show with him.

I'm really glad I got to meet Joe. I still think about him and I hope he and his wife are doing great.

We have been distant for a while because of other issues between the two of us that I will not mention here. Anyway, even though she didn't seem like she cared, I still wanted to make at least some effort to be there for her, as she had done with me in the past, and so occasionally I would just bring little gifts to her when we were at school.

 OK, maybe not occasionally, I think I did go a little overkill at one point, but that was also kind of because I'm not proud to admit it, but I also did want her attention back as a friend so that's one of the other reasons why I kept doing it. Anyway, the problem arose were each time that I would give her a gift, she would always respond with you didn't have to, or you don't have to, with a thank you somewhere down the line. The thing is, is that it never felt sincere, it always felt either forced from somewhere, or like she didn't really give a fuck About the gift itself and just like the attention, as where I went all in. After a few months of this, I kept getting told that maybe I should back off and that she didn't seem interested in our friendship anyway so I shouldn't do the gifts and I should keep to myself. Well after the first couple times she said it, I probably should've taken the hint and backed off, but I don't know, I'm just too nice.

 Not to mention, I am also autistic so I am  fucked when it comes to social cues. Anyway, this went on for a while, and eventually, the coffee was the last straw. I saw her in the lunchroom and she didn't seem well, and I had just gone to the coffee shop that morning, I got two coffees, one for me and also with her in mind, but I was sick of hearing other people who had opinions on the matter so I just kept it to myself, and didn't tell them about it. There is where I probably made the wrong move, because the people who were giving me their opinions I was close with, and they were giving me advice on the matter but I shut it down because I didn't care what they had to say and I wanted to do my own thing.

 Regardless, I did it anyway and I was happy about it, even though I had done it numerous times before and had gotten the same result, but this time was different. I walked into the lunchroom with my head held high, and I gave it over to her and told her that I hoped that she felt better And to have a good day. She said thank you, but then she followed it up with that but, in that phrase that she had said many times that I had just grown sick of. At that point, I had gotten severely pissed off, because I honestly felt like all these times where I was doing something nice just I got back thanks, but I don't really care. So, this is where now I think I might have overreacted, I took the coffee off the table and just walked away with it, whispering fine, I guess I just fucking won't next time, under my breath as not to cause a scene cause they were other people in there. I said some other things out of anger, I probably told her to shut up, and then I was just trying to do something nice for her because I know she was having a hard day, but now she can just deal with the hard day without someone being there for her, which I'm not proud of. 

 Now, I'm not sure if her saying you didn't have to, was away for them to nicely say that they didn't want me spending my money on them, or maybe they felt burdened by the fact that I was sort of taking care of them and giving them gifts and they didn't want that, or maybe they just didn't want the gifts in general but didn't want to be rude about it.

 This happened a while back, but I've recently just started thinking on it and started to ruminate about it. I just want to know, was I overreacting? Am I the asshole, or did I do the right thing, and I should probably just let it go? Your thoughts and opinions would be appreciated.",1,1757783116.0,AITAH,8,1.0,False

Travelers searching for **Luxury Vacation Rentals USA** expect more than glossy listings and inflated hotel prices. They want authenticity, fair rates, and meaningful human connections. For independent hosts, this means holding onto what matters most: **your keys, your freedom, and your earnings.**

On too many platforms, hosts are forced into rigid policies, high fees, and algorithms that often benefit corporate operators over local homeowners. But with platforms like [Llivo](https://www.llivo.com/), hosting is being redefined. You stay in control of your property, your pricing, and your guest experience—because it’s your space, and you deserve to keep more of the cash.

https://preview.redd.it/2aicqnyeryof1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=30dd0c400f8fbac1e0f2a3ccb7e23db1eea8a911

#  Why Control Matters for Hosts

Traditional platforms sell a dream of “easy income,” but for many independent hosts, the reality is far from empowering. Service fees can take a big cut from each booking, and guests often end up paying unexpected charges. These hidden costs hurt your reputation and reduce your ability to attract repeat bookings.

Transparent, host-first platforms change that dynamic. They respect your right to decide:

* When your property is available
* How much to charge based on demand
* What extras (like airport pickups) you want to provide

It’s hosting with freedom, not limitations—and that’s exactly what makes it sustainable in the growing **short term rental** market.

 **Keeping the Cash Without the Headaches**

Every booking should be a win-win: guests get a fair stay, and hosts get to keep more of what they earn. Llivo makes that possible by:

* Using **Stripe** for secure, direct payments—without holding back your earnings.
* Showing transparent fees upfront so there are no surprises.
* Allowing you to create listings that highlight your strengths, not just what algorithms want.

When you’re not worried about hidden cuts, you can focus on what really matters: creating a stay that travelers rave about.

#  Hosting on Your Terms During the World Cup

With the **World Cup 2026** set to bring millions of fans across the U.S., locals are uniquely positioned to cash in. Hotels will overcharge, rideshares will surge, and fans will look for alternatives that feel fair and welcoming.

As a host, this is your chance to:

* Raise rates responsibly while staying competitive with hotels
* Offer optional airport pickups and stadium drop-offs for added income
* Share local insights that make fans feel like insiders

The hosts who thrive won’t be the ones who bend to corporate platforms—they’ll be the ones who keep the keys, keep the cash, and deliver authentic experiences. That’s how you stand out as one of the[ **Best US Rental Properties with Transport.**](https://www.llivo.com/p/room-rent-usa)



 **The Human Advantage**

Hosting is not just about filling nights; it’s about filling experiences. Guests remember the personal welcome, the conversation over coffee, and the local tips that made their trip special. Those moments don’t come from an algorithm—they come from **hosts who care.**

By staying in control of your space and earnings, you create the freedom to add those touches that make you unforgettable. And that’s what drives glowing reviews, repeat bookings, and long-term success.

# Final Words

When you share your home, you shouldn’t have to give away your freedom—or your earnings. Hosting on transparent platforms lets you keep the keys, keep the cash, and host on your terms.

As the World Cup approaches, now is the time to step forward, take control, and turn your property into more than just a listing. Make it a part of the global celebration, and make it work for you.

First Mate: Ulysses O’Neil

Time: Appears to be dusk

Location: Carcosa?

Vessel: *Outis*

Report:

  •Six souls onboard

•Engine destroyed

•All clocks stopped, the compass is spinning, and mercury is frozen in the thermometer

•Fog encircles the vessel, there is no current, and the temperature feels higher than 30℃ 

•One crewmember detained



Personal Notes:

Pyke did not explain his meaning when he said we were in Carcosa. After uttering the word, he returned to his own cabin. He held a reverence for the word, as if it were forbidden to even know it. It looked as if there was a physical atonement after having this knowledge brought back. His age showed; with a hunched back and bagged eyes, he went away.

I went to the bridge to write my account of the previous day, but I looked at the instrumentation first. The compass spun rapidly, and the clock on the wall read 3:03. I looked at the thermometer on the wall and saw condensation around the red marks. It was still marked at 3℃, but it was so cold it burnt the tip of my finger when I touched the glass. Hot enough to sweat, but cold enough to freeze mercury. Instinctively, I muttered a small prayer.

I wrote my first mate's report, in my head, trying to make sense of our situation and Pyke's unusual demeanor. It felt early in the morning, though by that point the sun showed through the now gray fog as if it were midday. I finished my report and went back down to the deck. Mr. Peter was on the deck, leaning on the side, smoking a cigarette, looking far less green than the last time I saw him. Sweat stains were under his Oxford shirt, his velvet red vest looked newly tailored. 

“Signore,” he said to me, “do you mind telling me why we are no longer moving?” his voice had a hidden danger in the simple question. 

“The engine is flooded.”

“Then unflood it.”

“We need to get the water out of the hull first.”

“Then get the water out.”

“I’m working on it, but the shipment may be delayed on account that I have no clue where we are.”

“Then figure out where we are, unflood the hull, and fix that engine.” Danger was no longer hidden from his voice.

“I'll see what I can do,” jaw was clenched, fist balled. I didn’t much appreciate his tone.

As I passed by him, Lee came out of the crew cabin, “Fuck, it's hot,” he said, cracking his back. His eyes centered on me, “Has Pyke talked to you?” 

“He has, ye?” 

“Something about being in Carcosa, whatever the hell that means. Once the engine went out, he told me to hit the bed. I would say he lost a screw if it wasn't hot as hell in March, dead calm, and your crazy ass didn't see a damn ghost last night,” 

“We can figure out what he means later. For now, wake Jim and John, we need to start getting the water out,” I wanted to focus on what I could control in the moment. 

“Oh, come on, I just woke up, Paddy. Don't your kind drink tea or something in the morning?”

“Wake them, Lee,”

“Fine,” he turned towards the door. “Fuckin' mick,” I heard him mutter under his breath.

“Would you like to repeat that, Mr. Lee?” My tone was controlled

He paused for a moment, not even turning to face me. With the pose of a scared cat, he returned back into the crew quarters. A little while later, he emerged with the others.

Water was up to my knees when I was in the hull. The crew knew how long of a day we were about to have, but we needed to work. I scooped water and passed it back to John behind me, who passed it to Lee on the deck, where Jim tossed it overboard. For hours, we went at it, my hands becoming raw and my back stiff. We took a break when the water was halfway, splitting two cans of salted meat and sharing burnt coffee. It took most of the day to get the water down to only a few centimeters. Pyke remained in his cabin, Mr. Peter watched like a guard over a chain gang, the sun stayed in the same place even after what had to have been nine hours. 

When we finished, I went to check on Pyke, while Lee went to make his initial assessment of the engine. Outside the Captain's quarters door, I heard what sounded like the ramblings of a madman.

“Dear lord… he who wears the yellow robe… he who calls for the lost ones…”  

Before I heard more, I knocked, “Pyke, the crew…”

“Leave me be!” A voice filled with boiling annoyance.

Recoiling as if slapped, I stared at the door. Never had I seen him yell like that, especially towards me. So I left him be and went for dinner.

“Mr Ulysses,” John approached while I ate canned beef on stale bread.

“Yes, John?”

“Lee told me… he told me the engine is dead. It took in too much water,” his voice cracked with nervousness. 

I looked at him; he was visibly scared but trying to hide it. “Thank ye, John, I'll see what we can do,” I said, hiding my nerves behind a real veil of fatigue. 

“Mr. Ulysses… where exactly is carcosa?,”

Standing up and forcing what I remembered to be a comforting small smile, “I don't know, but Pyke has been sailing since before I was born. I've sailed with him for nearly six years, I believe he surely knows what to do,” I said with a pat on his shoulder, “go eat something, it's important to keep your strength and wits,” with which I left him.

I found Lee in the engine room, yelling every expletive. 

“What do you mean she's dead?”

“The whore of a machine took on too much fuckin’ water,” he smacked the engine with his wrench and screamed in frustration. He then turned his head back towards me as we both remained crouched in the small room, “Has Pyke fuckin’ come out yet?,” 

“No, he told me to leave him be when I knocked on his cabin,” 

“What the hell is wrong with him? I expect that lazy wop to not help, hell even the darkie is doing work, but this is Pyke’s damn ship,” 

“Can't you go through one conversation without being an absolute bastard?”

“Oh no, touch a never Paddy? Sorry, didn't realize you had such a ‘delicate constitution’, learn to take a fuckin’ joke,”

I wanted to break his nose right there, “what did Pyke tell you on the bridge this morning?,” 

“I already told you, when the water went flat and the engine died, he just said that word and told me to leave him alone,” 

I nodded my head, “alright, just do what you can here,” I paused, “and Lee, I won't refrain from beating ye like a dog if I here ye talk bad about the crew again,”

 His eyes widened as I left the engine room.

Back on the deck I saw Jim fishing overside, John was eating on the deck, and Mr. Peter walked towards me, “Signore, why am I hearing the engine is dead?,” his voice was low.

“Cause it is,”

“Fix it,” 

“That's beyond my expertise, and Lee is the only one on here that knows anything about engines,”

“That cargo needs to be in Manhattan in two days,”

“It's appears that won't happen,”

“Make it happen…” 

“Unless if you know more about petrol engines than Lee, then we will remain stranded for the time being,” 

Mr. Peter then muttered something in Italian, most likely cursing my name, as he took his vest off, rolled up his sleeves and went into the hull. Turns out he did know more about petrol engines than Lee.

I counted our food supplies, two weeks of food and water, and could make it last four weeks with rationing. Jim had caught a blue gill and was cooking it on the stove in the crew cabin. I would rather not rely on the fickleness of a drunk fisherman though, and that doesn't solve our water supply. With the whiskey we could make the water last, but Mr. Peter doesn't seem like he would be up for us to take from his supply. 

After, I was smoking a cigarette on deck, the sun was finally setting, that's when Pyke left his cabin. He was stumbling, leaning on walls and rails, his glassy eyes and heavy breathing rang of drunkenness.

Jim just finished eating, John came out of the bridge, Pyke looked confused as he stumbled and spoke low to himself. 

“Sir, are you alright?” I asked with concern for the old captain's well-being. His eyes pierced with what looked like shock, fear and rage when he saw me. He lifted his drunken trembling finger at me. 

“Death! Take this crew before his hands grip our souls!” he turned to John, “for these are the innocent, and have no knowledge on the godless happenin's the King has brought upon,” he stumbled and I caught him, “his grip is closing on our souls… her song tempts, but has no love, he feasts for his hunger is eternal,” Lee and Mr. Peter appear from the hull hearing the commotion.

“The fuck is this?” Lee said with confusion,

Pyke stood up and looked at Lee, “Have you journeyed to the springs of the sea or walked in the recesses of the deep?” his voice boomed out. He then looked towards me, falling forward as he gripped my shirt, tears formed in the corners of his eyes as he stared at me.

“That seasoned veteran cursed by fate so long,” eyes then falling shut, “oh Ulysses, the unluckiest man alive,” his words drifted off.

John and I carried him into his cabin with no words passed, both silently agreeing it was drunken knownsense, but what he had said gnawed at me. Two emptied bottles of single malt lay on his desk with one halfway finished. His journal was open with scribbles of swirling symbols, fishmen, strange words I've never seen, sketches of an impossible city of swirls and organics, names like Dagon and “The King in yellow,”. That last one had a sense of distant familiarity, a title I've known without hearing.

We gathered on the deck, Lee and John bickered over Pyke's words. Mr. Peter watched with his now grease stained oxford as he smoked. Jim stood behind in silence. 

“Pyke is out for now, Lee and Mr. Peter, anything on the engine?” I asked.

“There might be some hope, we have the water out, but the plugs are shot… I might be able to find a solution.” 

“Wait, are we not going to talk about what just happened?” John asked with disbelief.

“What is there to talk about? When he sobers we can ask him, but for now we need to focus on what is in our control. Peter please continue.”

Mr. Peter was about to continue before Lee interruptededededededed, “woah who made you captain?” looking at me.

“With Pyke out I am acting captain,” I said to Lee, which made him scoff.

“Listen your type are made to take orders, let someone of the right stock actually take the lead,” 

I clenched my jaw, I was far too tired and frankly frightened to deal with his behavior at the moment, “We have an order of command Mr. Lee, I would advise ye follow it,” 

“You ain't in the king's army no more, anyway, aren't micks used to following a proper anglo-saxon, that is what your type is bred for,” he smirked, I lunged, we ended up on the deck. My fist landed on his eye, then his mouth. His lip busted instantly. He kneed my gut and punched my jaw. John pulled me off of him as Mr. Peter made suree to keep Lee on the ground with a .38 handgun he had hidden in his pocket. 

“Go fuck yourselves, I knew having a violent goddamned paddy onboard was bad luck!” Lee yelled up, Mr. Peter gave him a good kick.

“I recommend you remain silent Signore,” he said with a reserved distance, then he saw me with my heaving chest, “you should be smarter than that,” 

Before I could respond there was a thump on the deck behind us. Jim was on his back convulsing violently. His head slammed against the wood as his mouth foamed and his arms and legs flayed. John and I rushed to him. 

“Jim what's happening?” John asked. 

His head bashed on the wood, leaving arches of blood on each impact. I grabbed a life preserver and placed it under his head. Mr. Peter and Lee joined us surrounding Jim. I held his shoulders, unsure of what to do.

Jim stopped suddenly, he lay flat on the ground as his spit dribbled out of his mouth down both his cheeks and absorbed into his beard. 

“Jim?” Lee cautiously asked, “is he alive?”

 I knelt down and placed my finger under his jaw, I could feel a pulse. “He's alive,” I turned my head to look at the others, when I felt a hand wrap around my wrist. I turned my head back and saw Jim's eyes open. His face was etched in fury. 

“Where is she!” he yelled, his nails digging into my wrist, I felt blood trickle down my fingers.

“Jim calm down and let go,” I said, trying to pry his hand from my wrist. His grip tightened more and his other hand gripped my shirt. 

“THE WOMAN SINGING, WHERE DID SHE GO!?” he pulled my shirt till it ripped. John pulled me back by my shoulders, but Jim’s grip was too tight on my wrist. He then heaved and gagged, his eyes never leaving mine. A black bile shot from his mouth, covering my face, neck and chest. 

Lee kicked Jim’s chest, causing him to release his grip, sending John and I back. I fell on my arse while John caught himself on the side. Blooexplainrm, and when I looked up Jim was galloping on all fours as he charged toward Lee. He tackled him and started clawing at his chest, seemingly not feeling any of Lee's defensive blows to his face and ribs. 

Mr. Peter raised his pistol at Jim, I jumped to my feet and hit him in his gut before he could get a shot off, knocking the pistol from his hand after. I was not going to lose a crewmember. Jim had clawed through Lee's shirt and started leaving deep bloody marks with his finger nails on his chest. Not stopping after I hit Mr. Peter I used my momentum and flung my full body weight at Jim. My arms wrapped around his body as we clashed to the ground, I wrapped my legs around his knees, and put my arms under his arms and held his head from behind. 

“YOU'RE HIDING HER FROM ME YOU WHORE SONS!” Jim screamed as he struggled against my hold. 

“Rope!” I yelled at the others. 

John quickly grabbed the strands of rope we used on the door the day prior. Jim started to vomit more onto the deck, leaving an oily slick in front of him. Jim scratched my arms as I held him down, while Mr. Peter and John tied his legs together. I let go of my hold and pulled his arms behind him. We tied his hands behind.

“Oh Fuck, you queer sap!” Lee screamed as he laid on his back, “what the hell was that you fat blotto trash?” 

I stood above Jim, panting and looking down, “Jim! What was that?”

He stopped struggling against the bindings, and then started crying, “Why did you take her away… damn you all,” he then started getting choked on his sobs. 

Jim couldn't speak as his cries grew more and more. Carrying him to Pyke's cabin and setting him down on the deck. We dragged the still drunken Pyke from his bed, he rambled half awake as Lee took him to the crew quarters. Jim wriggled his body as we placed him on the bed. I grabbed Pyke's old Winchester model 1897 from the wall with four boxes of buckshot and brought it out with me. Mr. Peter grabbed one of the broken poles and jammed the door shut.

I filled a bucket with salt water and stripped down to my undergarments. I cleaned off putrid black bile from myself with a rag. Lee poured whiskey over his chest wounds and dressed them with bandages. I grabbed the bottle from Lee and poured it down my arm. It stung, but with the proof it should be enough to disinfect. I then wrapped my arm. Lee and I didn't say a word, a silent agreement that we have more pressing issues. I admit his swollen eye and split lip was a sweet catharsis.

John called me into the crew quarters, holding his nose shut when he showed me the fish Jim had eaten. It looked uncooked, bloated and a rotten gray to it. Bite marks were on its side, and small worms flicked out of the slush of its flesh. I tossed it overboard. 

The four of us gathered on the bridge, the sun seemed to hang at sunset for a few hours now, we were all exhausted. John smoked the first cigarette I've seen him smoke. I guess we all needed one.

“The fish was uncooked?” Lee said with disbelief, “I saw him cooking…” 

“I saw it when he caught it too, it was not dead, hell it was actually a good catch. Do we know if it was the fish?,” John interrupted. 

“It had to be,” I interjected, “it was the only thing Jim ate or drank that each of us hadn't,”

“What about Pyke? He was losing it last time we saw him,” Lee added, “and he ain't had no fish,”

“He seemed more loaded than anything, Jim wasn't quoting scripture or doing a christ in the temple act,” I puffed on my cigarette, “it must surely be the fish”
	
“Then what the hell is wrong with Pyke?” Lee said, his eye now a purplish brown.

“He knows something, I heard him praying to something…it didn't sound like the hate Jim had, and he didn't attack us.” I add, still defending the old captain.

“Diàvulu,” Mr. Peter said taking a drag from his cigarette, “Signores, lu Diàvulu has this ship in his eyes,” 

Lee threw his hands up, “The hell does devolo mean?” 

“He means the devil…and I wish we were so lucky,” Pyke's voice said from the doorway. 

We all turned toward him, he was tipsily leaning on the doorway, but the light in his eyes seemed to have returned. Crossing the room he joined our circle.

“Sorry for my absence, I just couldn't believe I was here again,” he said with a battered pain in his words. He let out a sigh and stood as straight as he could, “We are in Carcosa… this is a place both God and the Devil fear. This is neither Heaven, Hell, or the Earth,” stroking his beard, he chose his words carefully, “I've been here before, in ‘98, we were stranded while patrolling the Cuban shores… My captain was first to go. He said The King in Yellow had spoken to him, gave him the path home,” his jaw clenched, “described our destination as beautiful dread, harmful bliss… we thought he was mad, but then we saw him,” his eyes became distant, “faces on faces is how he looked, mangled flesh of tentacles of man. And he fought for us, fought for our eternity, as others joined the fray for our pointlessly drastic lives,” his voice dropped, “beings older than our world… older than the Lord. We are in Dagon's realm, we heed their calls for it's the only path we have,” he stopped and thought for a moment, “we wrecked upon land, or I had a wreck. I can't remember if the rest of the crew was alive or dead then. A great phallic monolith stuck from the reef on which I was stranded. Visages of changed people were carved on its length. Images of the Children of Dagon. Then it came. A titan of the sea crawled from the waters and slung its arms around the monument.”

Lee spoke up, “What are you talking about? None of that meant anything,” 

Pyke's face turned to rage, “If you don't listen to my words then your soul is already lost!” he then slowed, “The devil tricks ya, God loves ya…they take ya,” his eyes went over each and everyone of us, “hold onto ya soul, for ya body will fail, ya minds will madden, and ya heart may give in.” 

His rambling left us silent, he chortled low, “ya will see, for I remember being here, know I've seen them, they are called The Old Ones.” he sat down, “the problem however, when I bring back those memories I forget them. As if the mind makes you forget the terror, relegating it to a long forgotten nightmare.”

He sighed the looked around, “For now we have to find a way out,” his eyes landed on Lee, “how goes repairs?”

“We maybe able to fix it, Peter and I worked on it earlier, he gave same insight,”

“My name is Dante… I think we are past the point of aliases,” Dante cut in, “I have worked on tractors since I was a boy, and fixed engines during the war,” he said to nobody in particular. 

“Ya and Lee fix the engine, use whatever ye can,” Pyke turned to me, “how are supplies?”

“Four weeks if begin to ration now,”

“Good…Mr. John stay next to Mr. Ulysses, nobody is to be left alone,” 

“Yes sir,”

Pyke looked at us all, “Get rest now if ye 
need it, I'll stay up and make sure nothing happens,” 

I admit his explanation for where we are sounded so fantastical that it left a sour taste in my mouth. His words were nearly, if not wholly blasphemous. It sounded more like dancing around than a true answer. I kept my thoughts to myself, with the rest of the crew seemingly placid in his words.

The four of us shuffled into the crew quarters, we all settled into our hammocks. Sleep came quickly that night.

Rounds hit the ground around me as I ran across the shell battered field. Men were stuck up to their knees in mud as rounds peppered them. I passed a young man, his intestines poured out of him as he screamed for his mother. A man to my right in front of me was hit in his neck, an artery torn, a gallon must have poured out instantly as he tensed up and fell back to the ground. Private Stantoun ahead of me dropped like a bag of grain as his brain exploded from the back of his head. There was no time to concern myself with his death, with the death of a man I knew since I was a boy. Explosions sent limbs flying through the air, but I had only hoped to make it to cover. Men dived into craters with what looked like shallow water, but became engulfed into the mud, while anyone who attempted to help them got chewed by the Fritz's MGs. 

“For King and Coun…,” a man was blown to hell before finishing.
	
Screams of men charging, death rattles, the smack of lead tearing raw flesh. Snapping of bones when men got stuck in the mud at full sprint. Cries for help being silenced by the whistle of the officers behind. I only focused ahead. 

Running I saw the corpse of a rotting horse strung in barbed wire. I dove down just when I heard bullets hit the rotting side. I held my enfield to my chest as I tried to compose myself. The German line was close. To my surprise the lad had followed me this far. He was hyperventilating when he reached me, tears spilled down his face.

“I can't go… I can't go…I can't go,” he repeated over and over. 

“Just hang on, don't give into dread son…,” I gripped his shoulder, “slow your breath, panic won't save you. Courage lad, no panic, don’t hang back” 

He eased his breathing, and looked at me. His tear swollen eyes were far too innocent, “sorry sir… please excuse me…” he was so young, those eyes pleading for help. I was going to tell him he was going to be alright, he was going to see his home, but suddenly an explosion went off behind his back and I went out. 

I awoke in the hammock, sun light shined through the port hole, but there was no way to tell what time of day it truly was. I grabbed the Winchester and hung the strap over my shoulder as I stepped onto the deck. 

Pyke was yelling into the hull, he looked sober, “I don't care if it takes ya arm, just get that damned engine working!” he then heard me approaching, “Mr. Ulysses, go get Mr. Jim some food and water. And tell me if he continues to talk about that woman he heard,” I simply nodded and went back to the crew cabin. 

I woke John, got a can of corned beef and water, then stepped back onto the deck. To our surprise the Albatross was back, she now stood in front of Pyke's cabin.

“I thought you were telling fibs when you told of a bird that big,” John said, his voice filled with fascination.

It squawked at us, “I don't lie son,” I said, staring down the bird, “Go on!” I yelled at it, “ye get moving!”

When I stepped closer it clapped its beaks at me and held its wings out. How bright that sea bird's eyes were. Opening the can I tossed a couple pieces of beef. That made her move.

“Why didn't you just kick it or hit it with your gun?” John asked.

“It’s best not to hurt creatures that don’t deserve it, and I believe we best not make Neptune have any more disdain towards us. He tends to not take kindly to those who needlessly harm his creatures,” I said, handing John the food and water, then pulling the pole wedged in the handle.

Entering the room we were hit with the smell of rotting fish and human shit. Jim was still where we left him, but Pyke's bed was covered in his slick vomit. John audibly gagged, Jim let out a soft whimpered cry. 

“Is she back?” His voice was hoarse.

“Will you attack me if I untie you?” I asked.

“Are you still hiding her?”

“There is no her Jim,”

“LAIR!” he raged and he struggled against his bindings, his wrist were raw and chaffed.

“Jim settle down, we need ye to eat,” stretching out the can to him. When my hand neared him, he bit towards me. I pulled my hand back. 

“You keep her for yourself, you think I don't know what's happening?” Jim said, his lips black and chapped from his acidic upheaves. 

“Jim we need ye to eat,” I said again calmly, “I know you thought you saw a woman, but it's been the same people onboard,” 

He spit onto the bed, a tooth was with the dark snot, “do you not hear her? She calls for you, calls for your return,” his voice was a whimper.

“Who is she, Jim? Where did you see her?” I humored him.

“She was whispering in Lee's ear, before you attacked him. You wanted her, and your jealousy over took you, you needed her song in your ear,” 

“That's not the reason I attacked him Jim… please just eat,” I said with a pleading edge

He bit into his cheek then spit out the chunk onto the bed. His teeth now dark and crimson, “I NEED HER ODYSSEUS! I HEARD THE MUSE SONG. THE MUSE CALLING ME, CALLING YOU!” blood splattered with his spit. 

“Jim!” John yelled in shock

“SHE SUNG YOUR SONG! SHE TOLD OF A MAN WHO WENT TO WAR, AND LEFT HIS WIFE AND CALF BEHIND TO THEIR FATE!” His eyes narrowed on me, I felt punched in the chest, “TEN YEARS YOU SAIL FOR ITHACA! FOUR YEARS SHE CRIED YOUR NAME! AND NOW YOU SAIL TO HASTUR TO SPITE HER!” his voice was strained.

I backed away as the room started spinning around me. Cold water replaced my blood as I neared the door. 

Warmth, I needed warmth.

The throbbing of my heart filled my ears. I never told Jim of my past, I never even told Pyke about the boy. How did he know? I gripped the side of the vessel, my breathing coming in rapidly. What was happening to me? Why am I sweating? Why did my heart sound like the thud of artillery? Why did I shake from just words, why did this bring me back to dead days?

“Ulysses?” John said from behind, “are you alright?” 

I looked up into the gray sky, my breath coming in ragged. My eyes then focused on something. Something small, almost unseen as it came near me. A mite-sized particle, a weightless grain of sand.

“He was just talking applesauce, he's gone mad,” John tried to offer his reasoning, but my eyes followed this small object as it floated down. 

It floated down, passing my nose and gently landing on my knuckle. I brought it up to my face before it melted away.

This is my first proper setup, following a Barista Express, so quite the upgrade ;) I’m now struggling a bit with pulling shots with ideal coffee weight, shot time and yield weight. I’d like to follow the classic Italian double espresso at 14g of beans yielding around 28-30g within 25-30sec. My grinder is set to the finest setting rn, I’m tamping with enough pressure after careful WDT yet when I pull the shot I get some channeling and the yield is way too high, more like 50-60g within 30sec. As I’m new to this level of coffee making I have watched countless tutorials yet I just can’t figure out what’s happening. My only guess is beans at this point, they’re definitely not super fresh (waiting for a new pack rn as I was abroad for over a month), but wondering if older beans could even be responsible for this much discrepancy. Anything else I could be missing?

1ng2i2x,https://www.reddit.com/r/TechInUse/comments/1ng2i2x/explore_best_noise_cancelling_headphones_sony/,Explore Best Noise Cancelling Headphones Sony WHCH710N and See Why They're Trending,"The Sony WHCH710N headphones have been a constant companion of mine lately, and to say that they’ve surprised me would be an understatement. These aren’t just headphones; they feel like they’re designed to teleport you into a universe where your favorite artists play just for you. But like all gadgets, there’s more beneath the sleek design and that recognizable Sony branding.

**Design and Comfort**  
The very first thing I noticed was how lightweight these headphones are. At just 7.8 ounces, they feel almost feather-like, which is perfect for long sessions. The adjustable metal sliders are a subtle touch, letting me tweak the fit without feeling like I’m force-fitting them onto my head. My co-worker borrowed them during a lunch break, and even with different head shapes (he has a larger head than I do), the fit was snug yet comfortable. Sony seemed to get the balance right between form and function. Though, it would’ve been nice if these came with a more robust carrying case instead of the standard plastic material.

**Sound Quality and Noise Cancellation**  
The noise cancellation here almost feels too good for its class. Whether walking near traffic or sitting in a bustling coffee shop, the dual noise sensor technology actively blocks out distractions. One time, I accidentally wore them while my kids were having an intense game fight in the living room—suddenly, their shouting turned into distant murmurs. The 30mm drivers pack the sound with surprising clarity and richness. I distinctly remember playing Fleetwood Mac’s ""The Chain,"" and hearing every instrumental layer felt like I upgraded my entire audio experience. 

[Grab your Sony WHCH710N bargain—see Amazon.](https://audio-play.com/p/b085rnvj3p/)  

**Who’s It For?**  
If you’re a frequent traveler like me, these headphones make for a brilliant companion. Packing 35 hours of battery life, long-haul flights become much more bearable. The quick charging feature—giving you an hour of playback in just 10 minutes—is simply a lifesaver for those days when you forget to plug them in overnight. However, they lean towards casual users more than professional audiophiles since Sony tuned these for a balanced mix rather than studio-grade precision.

**Highlights**  
- Lightweight and adjustable design ensures comfort for long listening sessions.  
- Impressive battery life of up to 35 hours, ideal for travel and extended use.  
- Noise cancellation adapts to the environment for immersive listening.  
- Offers Bluetooth 5.0 with a 10-meter range and NFC one-touch pairing.  

**Flaws**  
- The carrying case quality feels underwhelming for the price.  
- Water resistance is notably absent, making these less ideal for outdoor workouts or unpredictable weather.  
- Despite touch controls being responsive, they take a bit of practice to master initially.  

**Competing Products**  
The WHCH710N headphones perform commendably against market competitors. Comparing them directly to the Bose QC35 II, which prides itself on top-tier noise cancellation, I’d say the Sony holds its ground surprisingly well but at a far more affordable price point. Meanwhile, Anker’s Soundcore Life Q30 offers similar specs for a slightly lower cost but doesn’t quite mirror the premium feel and seamless pairing experience of Sony. If battery life and travel-readiness are top priorities, these headphones sit comfortably ahead of their rivals.

**True Value**  
From a price-performance perspective, the WHCH710N does an excellent job. Their combination of comfort, adequate noise cancellation, and solid sound quality feels like getting a luxury experience without paying the luxury tax. Sure, some materials could be improved, and touch controls could be optimized further, but these minor critiques don’t detract much from their overall value. I’d honestly recommend these to anyone looking for a mid-tier pair of wireless headphones that doesn’t deplete the wallet.

I just need a person who would be a safe person to talk with and to be friends, who wouldn't hurt me. 

Fun/Weird fact: I was diagnosed with agoraphobia, which means....I cannot leave my house. When I do, it causes me to have a major panic attack, until I start vomiting or passing out. I force myself to get out once or twice a week. But I am always home! It isn't a life for me, but with my illness, and plus my disorder. It prevents me from leaving the house. 

Second fun fact: I used to be in school for nursing.

Third fun fact: I am CPR, first aid certified. 

Fourth fun fact: I have two babies that are 9 months apart.

Fun fact: I will always put others first, before myself. I will go out my way, to making sure someone is happy and healthy even If I am not. I love humans, nothing can change that. 

Fun fact: I have been single for 2 years, I used to be a wify, but he lefty me. I was abused mentally, verbally and physically. I haven't actually been on a date in 2 years. 

Fun fact: I love to cook, bake and clean! Just a passion for me. 

Fun fact: I have been sick for my whole life. I was born not breathing, so I still go once or twice a month for steroids. I was diagnosed with chronic ill in 2024, but have been through many doctors for a diagnosis. I was sick my whole life, never had a childhood (well, because of that and trauma) because I am always too sick or hospitalized for it. 

Fun fact: I used to own a snake named Kitty, a bearded dragon named Remi. (And yes, I am an anime person, I love watching anime)

Fun fact: I love to draw on my free time, if I am up to it. I mainly draw anime, or cartoons! I do turn them into stenciling for tattooing.

1ng2fif,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1ng2fif/aita_for_leaving_my_job_last_minute/,AITA for leaving my job last minute?,"Hi everyone! I'm Italian so I apologise in advance for any mistake.

So, basically, I was 25 when I found this job in Venice. I was an event planner. My contract clearly stated that my first month was a ""trial period"" so it meant that I could leave anytime before the actual contract.  
I worked for a really busy company and the events I had to organize all took place in a prestigious location. I expected the people there to be snobbish but not like this.  
I don't want to brag, but I loved this job, and I was really good at it, but things got too hard.

I clearly looked young, and they did not like it, especially the woman in charge of that ""prestigious"" place, who I will name Karen for obvious reasons.  
She continuously treated me as if I was a bad child needing to be educated. Here some examples:

\- I have a problem with the sun when I wear contact lenses, my eyes are really sensitive and start getting all watery, so during an event I had to keep my sunglasses on my head or at least in my hands because I had to escort people back and forth from the entrance to the room where the event was taking place. The only nice person in that place came to me telling me that Karen had been complaining about my sunglasses being visible because it was ""*inelegant and rude*"" of me.

\- A person once spilled some water on the floor, and I politely said that it was no problem. So I went to get some paper to clean, but Karen stopped me abruptly because I had to call the cleaning lady given that ""*it was her job to clean everything*"". (We're talking about literally two drops of water)

\- I used to treat the staff helping us (waiters and others) really well, talking to them, because I felt like an environment where everyone was comfortable was easier to work in. But noooo, Karen came to me once while I was talking to the girls taking care of the coats (I was literally updating them on some changes in the schedule) and literally scolded me *in front of other colleagues* for behaving ""**as if I was sipping coffee at the bar with some friends while working with staff that was supposed to be ignored during events**"" AND I AM QUOTING. I might be a bit friendly as a person and I get that it can look unprofessional from the outside sometimes, but that was completely uncalled for.

\- Karen called my boss more than once to tell him that even though the events went well, she wasn't there to be a teacher for me and that she deserved someone older. Spoiler: she was never there during the organization of the events but showed up only during said events.

\- My favourite colleague (my boss's daughter) was an angel and stood up for me several times. She could because she was a senior and had less fear of consequences being who she is. But things got a bit worse when Karen made her other colleagues call me very early in the morning, when I wasn't even supposed to be working, or very late when I wasn't supposed to be at the events because there was someone else supervising.

I was starting to have anxiety and the job I loved had soon turned out to be a nightmare. Also because once the month was over, I was supposed to work with Karen&co exclusively.  
At the end of the month, I was so exhausted that the day before the end of the trial period, I left.  
(I had done my best to organize the schedule of all the following events so that my favourite colleague wouldn't have to literally go insane with work and organization. Everything was already planned for the following month, basically.)  
I knew Karen went furious because I was the one who knew the place the best, all the rules and all the costs, and I had left without telling her. But honestly, I don't care. First, I could because it was clearly stated in my contract. Second, she had made my life a living hell only because I was 25 and therefore too young to actually be good at my job even though all the events had gone really well and some clients had requested me specifically as their planner.  
I chose my mental health over a job. And got a little revenge by leaving Karen from one day to the next.

1ng2e31,https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/1ng2e31/my_manual_deployment_process_cost_us_a_6figure/,My manual deployment process cost us a 6-figure launch. Here's the 4-node n8n workflow that saved my job.,"I was on a plane, 30,000 feet in the air, when our marketing team pushed the 'go-live' button on a massive product launch. I was also the only person who could deploy the crucial blog post announcing it.

I landed to 17 missed calls and a single text from my boss: ""Where is the announcement post? The launch is dying."" My stomach dropped. The manual process—SSH into the server, `git pull`, run the `hugo` build, `rclone sync`—was our weakest link, and it had finally snapped on the worst possible day. I had failed. The post-mortem was brutal. My 'process' was a liability, and so was I.

My first attempt at a fix was a naive cron job running a shell script. It felt like a band-aid, but I was desperate. It worked in staging, and I breathed a tiny sigh of relief. Then, two days later, it failed silently in production because of a simple git merge conflict. No one noticed for hours. My boss's look said it all: ""This is your last chance.""

That night, drowning in coffee and imposter syndrome, I was aimlessly clicking through my n8n instance. I saw the 'Execute Command' node. I'd only ever used it for trivial things. But then it hit me like a lightning bolt. What if n8n wasn't just an API orchestrator? What if it was my server agent? My own, private, self-hosted GitLab Runner?

My hands were shaking as I built it. This had to work.

**The Workflow That Changed Everything:**

It was almost laughably simple, but the stakes felt impossibly high.

1.  **The Listener (Webhook Node):** I started with a Webhook node. I configured our Gitea repository to send a POST request to this n8n webhook URL on every `push` to the `main` branch. This was the trigger.

2.  **The Fetcher (Execute Command Node):** My heart pounded as I configured the first Execute Command node. This was the moment of truth. I set the command to `cd /home/user/my-hugo-site && git pull origin main`. I made a test commit, pushed it, and watched the n8n execution log. The webhook fired... the node turned green. IT PULLED THE CHANGES. I almost screamed.

3.  **The Builder (Execute Command Node):** Riding the wave of adrenaline, I chained a second Execute Command node. Command: `cd /home/user/my-hugo-site && /usr/local/bin/hugo`. This node would run the static site generator's build process, creating the final HTML/CSS in the `/public` directory. I pushed another test commit. Success. The `/public` folder was freshly updated.

4.  **The Deployer (Execute Command Node):** The final step. One more Execute Command node. Command: `rclone sync /home/user/my-hugo-site/public my-s3-remote:production-bucket --progress`. I held my breath, hit execute, and frantically refreshed our website. The test change was live. Instantly.

I showed the marketing team the next day. ""From now on, just write your article, get it approved, and merge it to main. The site will be live in 5 seconds."" They stared in disbelief. My boss, who was ready to fire me a week ago, called it a ""game-changer.""

That sinking feeling of being a single point of failure was gone. It was replaced by the confidence of a rock-solid, automated system. Don't just use n8n to connect apps; use it to command your infrastructure. It might just save your career.",1,1757782151.0,automation,2,0.6,False

First Mate: Ulysses O’Neil

Time: Appears to be dusk

Location: Carcosa?

Vessel: *Outis*

Report:

  •Six souls onboard

•Engine destroyed

•All clocks stopped, the compass is spinning, and mercury is frozen in the thermometer

•Fog encircles the vessel, there is no current, and the temperature feels higher than 30℃ 

•One crewmember detained



Personal Notes:

Pyke did not explain his meaning when he said we were in Carcosa. After uttering the word, he returned to his own cabin. He held a reverence for the word, as if it were forbidden to even know it. It looked as if there was a physical atonement after having this knowledge brought back. His age showed; with a hunched back and bagged eyes, he went away.

I went to the bridge to write my account of the previous day, but I looked at the instrumentation first. The compass spun rapidly, and the clock on the wall read 3:03. I looked at the thermometer on the wall and saw condensation around the red marks. It was still marked at 3℃, but it was so cold it burnt the tip of my finger when I touched the glass. Hot enough to sweat, but cold enough to freeze mercury. Instinctively, I muttered a small prayer.

I wrote my first mate's report, in my head, trying to make sense of our situation and Pyke's unusual demeanor. It felt early in the morning, though by that point the sun showed through the now gray fog as if it were midday. I finished my report and went back down to the deck. Mr. Peter was on the deck, leaning on the side, smoking a cigarette, looking far less green than the last time I saw him. Sweat stains were under his Oxford shirt, his velvet red vest looked newly tailored. 

“Signore,” he said to me, “do you mind telling me why we are no longer moving?” his voice had a hidden danger in the simple question. 

“The engine is flooded.”

“Then unflood it.”

“We need to get the water out of the hull first.”

“Then get the water out.”

“I’m working on it, but the shipment may be delayed on account that I have no clue where we are.”

“Then figure out where we are, unflood the hull, and fix that engine.” Danger was no longer hidden from his voice.

“I'll see what I can do,” jaw was clenched, fist balled. I didn’t much appreciate his tone.

As I passed by him, Lee came out of the crew cabin, “Fuck, it's hot,” he said, cracking his back. His eyes centered on me, “Has Pyke talked to you?” 

“He has, ye?” 

“Something about being in Carcosa, whatever the hell that means. Once the engine went out, he told me to hit the bed. I would say he lost a screw if it wasn't hot as hell in March, dead calm, and your crazy ass didn't see a damn ghost last night,” 

“We can figure out what he means later. For now, wake Jim and John, we need to start getting the water out,” I wanted to focus on what I could control in the moment. 

“Oh, come on, I just woke up, Paddy. Don't your kind drink tea or something in the morning?”

“Wake them, Lee,”

“Fine,” he turned towards the door. “Fuckin' mick,” I heard him mutter under his breath.

“Would you like to repeat that, Mr. Lee?” My tone was controlled

He paused for a moment, not even turning to face me. With the pose of a scared cat, he returned back into the crew quarters. A little while later, he emerged with the others.

Water was up to my knees when I was in the hull. The crew knew how long of a day we were about to have, but we needed to work. I scooped water and passed it back to John behind me, who passed it to Lee on the deck, where Jim tossed it overboard. For hours, we went at it, my hands becoming raw and my back stiff. We took a break when the water was halfway, splitting two cans of salted meat and sharing burnt coffee. It took most of the day to get the water down to only a few centimeters. Pyke remained in his cabin, Mr. Peter watched like a guard over a chain gang, the sun stayed in the same place even after what had to have been nine hours. 

When we finished, I went to check on Pyke, while Lee went to make his initial assessment of the engine. Outside the Captain's quarters door, I heard what sounded like the ramblings of a madman.

“Dear lord… he who wears the yellow robe… he who calls for the lost ones…”  

Before I heard more, I knocked, “Pyke, the crew…”

“Leave me be!” A voice filled with boiling annoyance.

Recoiling as if slapped, I stared at the door. Never had I seen him yell like that, especially towards me. So I left him be and went for dinner.

“Mr Ulysses,” John approached while I ate canned beef on stale bread.

“Yes, John?”

“Lee told me… he told me the engine is dead. It took in too much water,” his voice cracked with nervousness. 

I looked at him; he was visibly scared but trying to hide it. “Thank ye, John, I'll see what we can do,” I said, hiding my nerves behind a real veil of fatigue. 

“Mr. Ulysses… where exactly is carcosa?,”

Standing up and forcing what I remembered to be a comforting small smile, “I don't know, but Pyke has been sailing since before I was born. I've sailed with him for nearly six years, I believe he surely knows what to do,” I said with a pat on his shoulder, “go eat something, it's important to keep your strength and wits,” with which I left him.

I found Lee in the engine room, yelling every expletive. 

“What do you mean she's dead?”

“The whore of a machine took on too much fuckin’ water,” he smacked the engine with his wrench and screamed in frustration. He then turned his head back towards me as we both remained crouched in the small room, “Has Pyke fuckin’ come out yet?,” 

“No, he told me to leave him be when I knocked on his cabin,” 

“What the hell is wrong with him? I expect that lazy wop to not help, hell even the darkie is doing work, but this is Pyke’s damn ship,” 

“Can't you go through one conversation without being an absolute bastard?”

“Oh no, touch a never Paddy? Sorry, didn't realize you had such a ‘delicate constitution’, learn to take a fuckin’ joke,”

I wanted to break his nose right there, “what did Pyke tell you on the bridge this morning?,” 

“I already told you, when the water went flat and the engine died, he just said that word and told me to leave him alone,” 

I nodded my head, “alright, just do what you can here,” I paused, “and Lee, I won't refrain from beating ye like a dog if I here ye talk bad about the crew again,”

 His eyes widened as I left the engine room.

Back on the deck I saw Jim fishing overside, John was eating on the deck, and Mr. Peter walked towards me, “Signore, why am I hearing the engine is dead?,” his voice was low.

“Cause it is,”

“Fix it,” 

“That's beyond my expertise, and Lee is the only one on here that knows anything about engines,”

“That cargo needs to be in Manhattan in two days,”

“It's appears that won't happen,”

“Make it happen…” 

“Unless if you know more about petrol engines than Lee, then we will remain stranded for the time being,” 

Mr. Peter then muttered something in Italian, most likely cursing my name, as he took his vest off, rolled up his sleeves and went into the hull. Turns out he did know more about petrol engines than Lee.

I counted our food supplies, two weeks of food and water, and could make it last four weeks with rationing. Jim had caught a blue gill and was cooking it on the stove in the crew cabin. I would rather not rely on the fickleness of a drunk fisherman though, and that doesn't solve our water supply. With the whiskey we could make the water last, but Mr. Peter doesn't seem like he would be up for us to take from his supply. 

After, I was smoking a cigarette on deck, the sun was finally setting, that's when Pyke left his cabin. He was stumbling, leaning on walls and rails, his glassy eyes and heavy breathing rang of drunkenness.

Jim just finished eating, John came out of the bridge, Pyke looked confused as he stumbled and spoke low to himself. 

“Sir, are you alright?” I asked with concern for the old captain's well-being. His eyes pierced with what looked like shock, fear and rage when he saw me. He lifted his drunken trembling finger at me. 

“Death! Take this crew before his hands grip our souls!” he turned to John, “for these are the innocent, and have no knowledge on the godless happenin's the King has brought upon,” he stumbled and I caught him, “his grip is closing on our souls… her song tempts, but has no love, he feasts for his hunger is eternal,” Lee and Mr. Peter appear from the hull hearing the commotion.

“The fuck is this?” Lee said with confusion,

Pyke stood up and looked at Lee, “Have you journeyed to the springs of the sea or walked in the recesses of the deep?” his voice boomed out. He then looked towards me, falling forward as he gripped my shirt, tears formed in the corners of his eyes as he stared at me.

“That seasoned veteran cursed by fate so long,” eyes then falling shut, “oh Ulysses, the unluckiest man alive,” his words drifted off.

John and I carried him into his cabin with no words passed, both silently agreeing it was drunken knownsense, but what he had said gnawed at me. Two emptied bottles of single malt lay on his desk with one halfway finished. His journal was open with scribbles of swirling symbols, fishmen, strange words I've never seen, sketches of an impossible city of swirls and organics, names like Dagon and “The King in yellow,”. That last one had a sense of distant familiarity, a title I've known without hearing.

We gathered on the deck, Lee and John bickered over Pyke's words. Mr. Peter watched with his now grease stained oxford as he smoked. Jim stood behind in silence. 

“Pyke is out for now, Lee and Mr. Peter, anything on the engine?” I asked.

“There might be some hope, we have the water out, but the plugs are shot… I might be able to find a solution.” 

“Wait, are we not going to talk about what just happened?” John asked with disbelief.

“What is there to talk about? When he sobers we can ask him, but for now we need to focus on what is in our control. Peter please continue.”

Mr. Peter was about to continue before Lee interruptededededededed, “woah who made you captain?” looking at me.

“With Pyke out I am acting captain,” I said to Lee, which made him scoff.

“Listen your type are made to take orders, let someone of the right stock actually take the lead,” 

I clenched my jaw, I was far too tired and frankly frightened to deal with his behavior at the moment, “We have an order of command Mr. Lee, I would advise ye follow it,” 

“You ain't in the king's army no more, anyway, aren't micks used to following a proper anglo-saxon, that is what your type is bred for,” he smirked, I lunged, we ended up on the deck. My fist landed on his eye, then his mouth. His lip busted instantly. He kneed my gut and punched my jaw. John pulled me off of him as Mr. Peter made suree to keep Lee on the ground with a .38 handgun he had hidden in his pocket. 

“Go fuck yourselves, I knew having a violent goddamned paddy onboard was bad luck!” Lee yelled up, Mr. Peter gave him a good kick.

“I recommend you remain silent Signore,” he said with a reserved distance, then he saw me with my heaving chest, “you should be smarter than that,” 

Before I could respond there was a thump on the deck behind us. Jim was on his back convulsing violently. His head slammed against the wood as his mouth foamed and his arms and legs flayed. John and I rushed to him. 

“Jim what's happening?” John asked. 

His head bashed on the wood, leaving arches of blood on each impact. I grabbed a life preserver and placed it under his head. Mr. Peter and Lee joined us surrounding Jim. I held his shoulders, unsure of what to do.

Jim stopped suddenly, he lay flat on the ground as his spit dribbled out of his mouth down both his cheeks and absorbed into his beard. 

“Jim?” Lee cautiously asked, “is he alive?”

 I knelt down and placed my finger under his jaw, I could feel a pulse. “He's alive,” I turned my head to look at the others, when I felt a hand wrap around my wrist. I turned my head back and saw Jim's eyes open. His face was etched in fury. 

“Where is she!” he yelled, his nails digging into my wrist, I felt blood trickle down my fingers.

“Jim calm down and let go,” I said, trying to pry his hand from my wrist. His grip tightened more and his other hand gripped my shirt. 

“THE WOMAN SINGING, WHERE DID SHE GO!?” he pulled my shirt till it ripped. John pulled me back by my shoulders, but Jim’s grip was too tight on my wrist. He then heaved and gagged, his eyes never leaving mine. A black bile shot from his mouth, covering my face, neck and chest. 

Lee kicked Jim’s chest, causing him to release his grip, sending John and I back. I fell on my arse while John caught himself on the side. Blooexplainrm, and when I looked up Jim was galloping on all fours as he charged toward Lee. He tackled him and started clawing at his chest, seemingly not feeling any of Lee's defensive blows to his face and ribs. 

Mr. Peter raised his pistol at Jim, I jumped to my feet and hit him in his gut before he could get a shot off, knocking the pistol from his hand after. I was not going to lose a crewmember. Jim had clawed through Lee's shirt and started leaving deep bloody marks with his finger nails on his chest. Not stopping after I hit Mr. Peter I used my momentum and flung my full body weight at Jim. My arms wrapped around his body as we clashed to the ground, I wrapped my legs around his knees, and put my arms under his arms and held his head from behind. 

“YOU'RE HIDING HER FROM ME YOU WHORE SONS!” Jim screamed as he struggled against my hold. 

“Rope!” I yelled at the others. 

John quickly grabbed the strands of rope we used on the door the day prior. Jim started to vomit more onto the deck, leaving an oily slick in front of him. Jim scratched my arms as I held him down, while Mr. Peter and John tied his legs together. I let go of my hold and pulled his arms behind him. We tied his hands behind.

“Oh Fuck, you queer sap!” Lee screamed as he laid on his back, “what the hell was that you fat blotto trash?” 

I stood above Jim, panting and looking down, “Jim! What was that?”

He stopped struggling against the bindings, and then started crying, “Why did you take her away… damn you all,” he then started getting choked on his sobs. 

Jim couldn't speak as his cries grew more and more. Carrying him to Pyke's cabin and setting him down on the deck. We dragged the still drunken Pyke from his bed, he rambled half awake as Lee took him to the crew quarters. Jim wriggled his body as we placed him on the bed. I grabbed Pyke's old Winchester model 1897 from the wall with four boxes of buckshot and brought it out with me. Mr. Peter grabbed one of the broken poles and jammed the door shut.

I filled a bucket with salt water and stripped down to my undergarments. I cleaned off putrid black bile from myself with a rag. Lee poured whiskey over his chest wounds and dressed them with bandages. I grabbed the bottle from Lee and poured it down my arm. It stung, but with the proof it should be enough to disinfect. I then wrapped my arm. Lee and I didn't say a word, a silent agreement that we have more pressing issues. I admit his swollen eye and split lip was a sweet catharsis.

John called me into the crew quarters, holding his nose shut when he showed me the fish Jim had eaten. It looked uncooked, bloated and a rotten gray to it. Bite marks were on its side, and small worms flicked out of the slush of its flesh. I tossed it overboard. 

The four of us gathered on the bridge, the sun seemed to hang at sunset for a few hours now, we were all exhausted. John smoked the first cigarette I've seen him smoke. I guess we all needed one.

“The fish was uncooked?” Lee said with disbelief, “I saw him cooking…” 

“I saw it when he caught it too, it was not dead, hell it was actually a good catch. Do we know if it was the fish?,” John interrupted. 

“It had to be,” I interjected, “it was the only thing Jim ate or drank that each of us hadn't,”

“What about Pyke? He was losing it last time we saw him,” Lee added, “and he ain't had no fish,”

“He seemed more loaded than anything, Jim wasn't quoting scripture or doing a christ in the temple act,” I puffed on my cigarette, “it must surely be the fish”
	
“Then what the hell is wrong with Pyke?” Lee said, his eye now a purplish brown.

“He knows something, I heard him praying to something…it didn't sound like the hate Jim had, and he didn't attack us.” I add, still defending the old captain.

“Diàvulu,” Mr. Peter said taking a drag from his cigarette, “Signores, lu Diàvulu has this ship in his eyes,” 

Lee threw his hands up, “The hell does devolo mean?” 

“He means the devil…and I wish we were so lucky,” Pyke's voice said from the doorway. 

We all turned toward him, he was tipsily leaning on the doorway, but the light in his eyes seemed to have returned. Crossing the room he joined our circle.

“Sorry for my absence, I just couldn't believe I was here again,” he said with a battered pain in his words. He let out a sigh and stood as straight as he could, “We are in Carcosa… this is a place both God and the Devil fear. This is neither Heaven, Hell, or the Earth,” stroking his beard, he chose his words carefully, “I've been here before, in ‘98, we were stranded while patrolling the Cuban shores… My captain was first to go. He said The King in Yellow had spoken to him, gave him the path home,” his jaw clenched, “described our destination as beautiful dread, harmful bliss… we thought he was mad, but then we saw him,” his eyes became distant, “faces on faces is how he looked, mangled flesh of tentacles of man. And he fought for us, fought for our eternity, as others joined the fray for our pointlessly drastic lives,” his voice dropped, “beings older than our world… older than the Lord. We are in Dagon's realm, we heed their calls for it's the only path we have,” he stopped and thought for a moment, “we wrecked upon land, or I had a wreck. I can't remember if the rest of the crew was alive or dead then. A great phallic monolith stuck from the reef on which I was stranded. Visages of changed people were carved on its length. Images of the Children of Dagon. Then it came. A titan of the sea crawled from the waters and slung its arms around the monument.”

Lee spoke up, “What are you talking about? None of that meant anything,” 

Pyke's face turned to rage, “If you don't listen to my words then your soul is already lost!” he then slowed, “The devil tricks ya, God loves ya…they take ya,” his eyes went over each and everyone of us, “hold onto ya soul, for ya body will fail, ya minds will madden, and ya heart may give in.” 

His rambling left us silent, he chortled low, “ya will see, for I remember being here, know I've seen them, they are called The Old Ones.” he sat down, “the problem however, when I bring back those memories I forget them. As if the mind makes you forget the terror, relegating it to a long forgotten nightmare.”

He sighed the looked around, “For now we have to find a way out,” his eyes landed on Lee, “how goes repairs?”

“We maybe able to fix it, Peter and I worked on it earlier, he gave same insight,”

“My name is Dante… I think we are past the point of aliases,” Dante cut in, “I have worked on tractors since I was a boy, and fixed engines during the war,” he said to nobody in particular. 

“Ya and Lee fix the engine, use whatever ye can,” Pyke turned to me, “how are supplies?”

“Four weeks if begin to ration now,”

“Good…Mr. John stay next to Mr. Ulysses, nobody is to be left alone,” 

“Yes sir,”

Pyke looked at us all, “Get rest now if ye 
need it, I'll stay up and make sure nothing happens,” 

I admit his explanation for where we are sounded so fantastical that it left a sour taste in my mouth. His words were nearly, if not wholly blasphemous. It sounded more like dancing around than a true answer. I kept my thoughts to myself, with the rest of the crew seemingly placid in his words.

The four of us shuffled into the crew quarters, we all settled into our hammocks. Sleep came quickly that night.

Rounds hit the ground around me as I ran across the shell battered field. Men were stuck up to their knees in mud as rounds peppered them. I passed a young man, his intestines poured out of him as he screamed for his mother. A man to my right in front of me was hit in his neck, an artery torn, a gallon must have poured out instantly as he tensed up and fell back to the ground. Private Stantoun ahead of me dropped like a bag of grain as his brain exploded from the back of his head. There was no time to concern myself with his death, with the death of a man I knew since I was a boy. Explosions sent limbs flying through the air, but I had only hoped to make it to cover. Men dived into craters with what looked like shallow water, but became engulfed into the mud, while anyone who attempted to help them got chewed by the Fritz's MGs. 

“For King and Coun…,” a man was blown to hell before finishing.
	
Screams of men charging, death rattles, the smack of lead tearing raw flesh. Snapping of bones when men got stuck in the mud at full sprint. Cries for help being silenced by the whistle of the officers behind. I only focused ahead. 

Running I saw the corpse of a rotting horse strung in barbed wire. I dove down just when I heard bullets hit the rotting side. I held my enfield to my chest as I tried to compose myself. The German line was close. To my surprise the lad had followed me this far. He was hyperventilating when he reached me, tears spilled down his face.

“I can't go… I can't go…I can't go,” he repeated over and over. 

“Just hang on, don't give into dread son…,” I gripped his shoulder, “slow your breath, panic won't save you. Courage lad, no panic, don’t hang back” 

He eased his breathing, and looked at me. His tear swollen eyes were far too innocent, “sorry sir… please excuse me…” he was so young, those eyes pleading for help. I was going to tell him he was going to be alright, he was going to see his home, but suddenly an explosion went off behind his back and I went out. 

I awoke in the hammock, sun light shined through the port hole, but there was no way to tell what time of day it truly was. I grabbed the Winchester and hung the strap over my shoulder as I stepped onto the deck. 

Pyke was yelling into the hull, he looked sober, “I don't care if it takes ya arm, just get that damned engine working!” he then heard me approaching, “Mr. Ulysses, go get Mr. Jim some food and water. And tell me if he continues to talk about that woman he heard,” I simply nodded and went back to the crew cabin. 

I woke John, got a can of corned beef and water, then stepped back onto the deck. To our surprise the Albatross was back, she now stood in front of Pyke's cabin.

“I thought you were telling fibs when you told of a bird that big,” John said, his voice filled with fascination.

It squawked at us, “I don't lie son,” I said, staring down the bird, “Go on!” I yelled at it, “ye get moving!”

When I stepped closer it clapped its beaks at me and held its wings out. How bright that sea bird's eyes were. Opening the can I tossed a couple pieces of beef. That made her move.

“Why didn't you just kick it or hit it with your gun?” John asked.

“It’s best not to hurt creatures that don’t deserve it, and I believe we best not make Neptune have any more disdain towards us. He tends to not take kindly to those who needlessly harm his creatures,” I said, handing John the food and water, then pulling the pole wedged in the handle.

Entering the room we were hit with the smell of rotting fish and human shit. Jim was still where we left him, but Pyke's bed was covered in his slick vomit. John audibly gagged, Jim let out a soft whimpered cry. 

“Is she back?” His voice was hoarse.

“Will you attack me if I untie you?” I asked.

“Are you still hiding her?”

“There is no her Jim,”

“LAIR!” he raged and he struggled against his bindings, his wrist were raw and chaffed.

“Jim settle down, we need ye to eat,” stretching out the can to him. When my hand neared him, he bit towards me. I pulled my hand back. 

“You keep her for yourself, you think I don't know what's happening?” Jim said, his lips black and chapped from his acidic upheaves. 

“Jim we need ye to eat,” I said again calmly, “I know you thought you saw a woman, but it's been the same people onboard,” 

He spit onto the bed, a tooth was with the dark snot, “do you not hear her? She calls for you, calls for your return,” his voice was a whimper.

“Who is she, Jim? Where did you see her?” I humored him.

“She was whispering in Lee's ear, before you attacked him. You wanted her, and your jealousy over took you, you needed her song in your ear,” 

“That's not the reason I attacked him Jim… please just eat,” I said with a pleading edge

He bit into his cheek then spit out the chunk onto the bed. His teeth now dark and crimson, “I NEED HER ODYSSEUS! I HEARD THE MUSE SONG. THE MUSE CALLING ME, CALLING YOU!” blood splattered with his spit. 

“Jim!” John yelled in shock

“SHE SUNG YOUR SONG! SHE TOLD OF A MAN WHO WENT TO WAR, AND LEFT HIS WIFE AND CALF BEHIND TO THEIR FATE!” His eyes narrowed on me, I felt punched in the chest, “TEN YEARS YOU SAIL FOR ITHACA! FOUR YEARS SHE CRIED YOUR NAME! AND NOW YOU SAIL TO HASTUR TO SPITE HER!” his voice was strained.

I backed away as the room started spinning around me. Cold water replaced my blood as I neared the door. 

Warmth, I needed warmth.

The throbbing of my heart filled my ears. I never told Jim of my past, I never even told Pyke about the boy. How did he know? I gripped the side of the vessel, my breathing coming in rapidly. What was happening to me? Why am I sweating? Why did my heart sound like the thud of artillery? Why did I shake from just words, why did this bring me back to dead days?

“Ulysses?” John said from behind, “are you alright?” 

I looked up into the gray sky, my breath coming in ragged. My eyes then focused on something. Something small, almost unseen as it came near me. A mite-sized particle, a weightless grain of sand.

“He was just talking applesauce, he's gone mad,” John tried to offer his reasoning, but my eyes followed this small object as it floated down. 

It floated down, passing my nose and gently landing on my knuckle. I brought it up to my face before it melted away.

It was a snowflake.

1ng2ajm,https://www.reddit.com/r/TestedByChery/comments/1ng2ajm/delve_into_babyganics_toy_wipes_review_are_they/,Delve Into Babyganics Toy Wipes Review Are They Truly Baby Safe,"**Babyganics 15689: My Daily Go-To for Cleaning Essentials!**

Life with a toddler can be chaotic, especially when they explore the world with their mouths and hands. I decided to try Babyganics 15689 Toy, Table & Highchair Wipes, and honestly, it’s become a staple in our household. The appeal of the product lies in its thoughtful design and promise of baby-safe cleanliness. Let’s dive into my experience with these wipes over the past month. Spoiler alert: It’s not perfect, but it’s close!

**Unpacking the Design and Convenience**

At first glance, the packaging caught my attention. Each wipe is neatly stored in a pack that’s compact and travel-friendly. With 25 wipes per pack and a set of three, it’s perfect for parents on the go. I tossed one into my diaper bag and left the other two at home for regular use. The resealable flap keeps the wipes fresh and moist, even when I forget to seal them properly—trust me, I’ve done it more than once, and they’ve stayed surprisingly efficient.

**Key Benefits of Babyganics Wipes**
- Made from plant-derived cleaning power and biodegradable materials.
- Safe for surfaces often touched or mouthed by babies.
- Free from ammonia, bleach, phthalates, and sulfates.
- Convenient and durable wipes that don’t shred after one use.

**Performance on Highchairs and Toys**

These wipes deliver a solid performance when tackling everyday messes. From sticky fruit residue on the highchair to the crayon smudges on toys, they clean without leaving a nasty film. What impressed me the most is how quickly they dry, making surfaces ready for playtime almost instantly. The wipes are fragrance-free, which is a blessing because I dislike overly scented cleaning products mixing into our home. However, if you’re tackling heavier messes, like dried cereal glued to the highchair, it might take a bit of elbow grease.

**Benefits**
- Non-abrasive yet durable enough to handle rough cleaning sessions.
- Quick cleaning and drying make them practical for busy parents.
- A fragrance-free formula keeps clean-up neutral and fresh.

**Where It Stumbles**

No product is perfect, and Babyganics wipes have their quirks. If you’re someone who likes a stronger scrubbing option, these might seem underwhelming for really hard-to-clean spots. Additionally, while it’s great that the pack is compact, I sometimes find it challenging to pull out just one wipe without dragging the next one partially out—a tiny flaw that occasionally makes things inconvenient.

**Drawbacks**
- Struggles with heavier, dried-on messes.
- Slightly inconvenient packaging design for one-handed use during diaper duty.
- For those who prefer a touch of scent, the fragrance-free aspect might feel too sterile.

**Real-Life Applications**

Over the last month, I’ve used these wipes everywhere—from the stroller and car seat to restaurant tables. They’ve given me peace of mind knowing my little one isn’t exposed to harmful chemicals. My sister, who babysits often, is equally hooked. She swears by how easy the wipes are to use during meal clean-up when my niece makes a mess. Even my co-worker borrowed a pack for cleaning her desk after an unfortunate coffee mishap, declaring them a “must-have” for their versatility.

**Competing Brands and Alternatives**

Comparing Babyganics wipes to other brands reveals some interesting insights. While competitors like Seventh Generation and Honest Company also focus on eco-friendly wipes, Babyganics edges out on convenience and baby-safe cleaning. Seventh Generation's wipes often feel thinner and less durable, leading to multiple wipes being used for tasks where one wipe from Babyganics suffices. However, Honest Company wipes hold a slight edge in luxurious texture and strength but come at a higher price point, which might deter budget-conscious parents.

Babyganics stands out for being well-balanced—eco-conscious, safe, and budget-aware. Still, if scent matters or you need a heavier-duty wipe for extreme messes, their competitors might be worth investigating.

**Quality for Price**

It’s fair to say Babyganics 15689 wipes offer fantastic value for their intended use. You’re not just paying for a cleaning product but peace of mind. The worry-free formulation and biodegradable materials make it feel like you’re investing in both your child’s health and the environment. While it isn’t the cheapest option out there, the performance and baby-safe profile justify the cost.

1ng29my,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerCheck/comments/1ng29my/should_you_switch_to_tide_liquid_detergent_with/,Should You Switch to Tide Liquid Detergent with Downy for Laundry,"Testing out the Tide 30772115978, I first noticed the combination of two powerhouse cleaning brands—Tide and Downy. As a self-proclaimed laundry enthusiast (purely for necessity, not passion), this caught my attention immediately. Ever since I got my hands on this liquid detergent, my laundry game has been dialed up a notch. 

**Design and Usability**  
The first thing to grab my attention was the sturdy packaging. At 132 fl oz, this container is exactly what you’d hope for in a laundry room essential—substantial but manageable. I didn’t need to wrestle with it while pouring, thanks to its well-thought-out spout. I also loved the vibrant design on the bottle, which made spotting it on a crowded shelf an easy task. While it’s not flashy, it screams practicality in every way.  

**Cleaning Performance**  
The effectiveness of this detergent really made me a believer in the Tide + Downy collaboration. Even stubborn coffee stains on my white shirts stood no chance. It tackled dirt and stains like an absolute pro. The concentrated formula sealed the deal for me, as it provided the right punch without needing a huge amount per wash. My kids are magnetically attracted to mud puddles, so having a detergent with this level of cleaning power has been a game-changer.  

[Check Tide 30772115978 price on Amazon.](https://alluringdeals.com/p/b0c3f9rh3s/)  

**April Fresh Scent**  
The iconic Downy April Fresh scent packs a delightful punch. After every wash, my clothes smelled crisp and clean, which genuinely made folding laundry *slightly* less of a chore. Is there anything better than crawling under fresh-smelling sheets after a long Sunday? I don’t think so. However, I’ll admit, the scent might feel a bit strong for those who prefer unscented laundry detergents. It works for me, but I can understand why it may be a divisive feature.  

**Compatibility with Washing Machines**  
This detergent boasts versatility—it’s compatible with both HE and non-HE washing machines. As someone who’s juggled between machines in different apartments, I appreciate products that work seamlessly across various setups. I tested it on cold water cycles (to save energy), and it didn’t skip a beat. The detergent dissolved beautifully without leaving any unwelcome soapy residues.  

**Key Benefits**  
• Impressive stain-fighting performance, even in cold water  
• Long-lasting, fresh fragrance that lingers post-wash  
• Works efficiently in both HE and non-HE machines  
• Concentrated formula means less product per load  

**Areas for Improvement**  
• The scent, while pleasant to some, might feel overpowering to others  
• Heavier bottle size could be tricky for those with limited grip strength  
• No built-in measuring cup, making it slightly inconvenient for precision  

**Direct Competitors**  
I compared this liquid detergent to a few big names like Gain and Arm & Hammer. What stood out for me was Tide’s superior cleaning action against tough stains. Gain’s Tropical Sunrise scent might have more exotic appeal, but the April Fresh fragrance from this detergent felt more grounded and classic. Arm & Hammer, known for its affordability, didn’t match Tide’s performance when it came to heavy-duty stains. To put it bluntly, Tide + Downy was the “heavyweight” champion without question. While it doesn’t necessarily win the price war, the results more than justify its cost.  

**Price Worthiness**  
Speaking of cost, if you’re debating whether this detergent is worth the investment, I’d argue that its efficiency and quality make it a smart spend. The concentrated formula ensures you’re not burning through the product faster than necessary. Sure, cheaper detergents exist, but they often require more product per wash. In the long run, this detergent delivers value where it truly counts—performance and longevity.

1ng25vt,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1ng25vt/300_days_without_drinking_tw_ed_sa/,"300 days without drinking (TW: ED, SA)","Tomorrow I will have been sober from alcohol for 300 days which is the longest I’ve been since I had my first drink. Wanted to share my story in case it helps anyone else out. 

I grew up as the fat girl until 8th grade when I said “fuck this” and overnight became the most obviously anorexic girl. In the summer between 8th grade and Freshman year I went from grossly overweight to dangerously skinny (10 point change in BMI). Everyone knew but no one did anything because I was a good student and didn’t cause any trouble. I got into running as a way to keep losing weight and was so over the top with it that I got quite fast and ended up joining the track team and being the best distance runner at my high school. I actually loved this because it gave me a cover for my disordered eating (“she’s just skinny because she runs so much” “she’s not anorexic, she’s just careful about what she eats before a race”)

Anyways this goes on and I graduated high school and got into an excellent college partially recruited for running. All this time I’d never had a drink in my life. I get to college and it’s kind of got this aggressive Greek scene. Basically all people did every weekend was get drunk in frat basements. So that’s what I did. There was definitely a social status attached to how much you could drink, and, desperate to be accepted, I threw myself into that with the same fervor I did running. I blacked out so many times over the course of college it’s not even funny. Just sad. I realized that a lot of the pressure to drink more was so that guys could take advantage of you, and that happened to me. I woke up in beds not even remembering meeting the person who I woke up next to, let alone consenting to anything. Obviously I’m not performing well as an athlete doing this either and my team seriously resents me because I’m not taking this seriously like they are (fair). All this time, again, I’m getting good grades and meeting all expectations so no one cares what I do. My parents just see their daughter with near perfect grades at a T10 college as a D1 athlete and think they’ve killed it as parents. 

I graduated and things get a little bit better for a time. I feel more comfortable in my skin and enter semi-recovery from my ED. I’m drinking less (though still binge drinking regularly) and come out as gay. (Ironically this is the part where my parents think they’ve failed at some aspect of parenting and I’m like “seriously? This is the bit you’re hung up on?” But whatever). I’m working as a bioinformatician (computer scientist for biomedical research) and things are generally going well for the first 18-24 months after graduation. 

Then the pandemic happens and I’m basically just told I now can work from home. I used this opportunity to become an excellent alcoholic. Living alone, no one could judge me or monitor me. I started putting Bailey’s in my morning coffee to get a buzz going throughout the day and then got drunk most nights. All I had to do was stay productive at work and I was golden. I even rationalized my alcohol consumption as recovery from my ED, because, hey, alcohol is calories and I was certainly taking them in! I went from 115lbs to 140+lbs in the first year of the pandemic. 

Eventually though, it just stopped being fun. I woke up every morning with a headache. I wasn’t even really getting drunk or enjoying the buzz anymore because my tolerance was so high. I had been out for over a year and hadn’t been in a serious relationship yet, partially because I’d rather sit at home and drink than have to put myself together enough for a date. I felt sad, lonely, fat, and miserable. 

About one year ago, I had a doctor’s appointment coming up so i basically unloaded on them and her response was an instant psych referral which I honestly think saved my life. I got started on medication for my underlying mental health issues and went through CBT for my alcoholism and anorexia. I had a couple of false starts and relapses on both fronts, but kept working at it. I can now say that I have not had a drink in almost 300 days which is something that is still mind blowing to me. When I started, I kind of envisioned just doing a 30 day break so I could lose my tolerance and “enjoy” drinking again. However, the longer I went without alcohol the more I realized how much it had been robbing me of my life. I can’t imagine what I could have done with my 20’s if I didn’t spend the majority of them drunk or hungover. 

I feel so grateful to get what I feel to be a 2nd chance at life. What worked for me may not work for you, but one thing I can say is that if you’re in the depths of it, there is hope. Love you all and I will not drink with you today. ",20,1757781593.0,stopdrinking,3,1.0,False

Ladies and gentlemen, buckle up for the *Clásico Nacional*—a match so charged it could power the entire Liga MX season. On September 13, 2025, Club América (17 points, league leader) hosts Chivas de Guadalajara (4 points, bottom of the table) at the sold-out Estadio Ciudad de los Deportes. The odds? América is the undisputed king of the betting hill, with prices ranging from **1.57 to 1.67** (implied probability: **60-62%**). Chivas? They’re priced at **5.0 to 5.35** (16-20%), which is basically the sportsbook’s way of saying, “Bet on these guys if you enjoy throwing money into a black hole.” The draw? A meager **25-26%**, because apparently, even a tie between these two is less likely than a Mexican heatwave in January.

### Parsing the Odds: Why América is the Favorite

Let’s crunch the numbers. América’s implied probability of 62% isn’t just a fluke—it’s a mathematical indictment of Chivas’ recent form. The Rojinegros have lost four straight matches, scoring a total of… *checks notes*… zero goals in their last two games. Their star striker, Javier Hernández (yes, that one), hasn’t found the net this season, which is about as effective as a screen door on a submarine. Meanwhile, América boasts a fully fit roster, including the electric Allan Saint-Maximin, Henry Martín (back from injury), and Bryan Rodríguez, who could outrun a cheetah if the situation called for it. Their coach, André Jardine, has turned them into a well-oiled machine since 2023—think of them as the Tesla of Liga MX: sleek, efficient, and slightly arrogant.

Chivas, on the other hand, are a walking metaphor for “work in progress.” Their last win? June 2025. Their attack? A group of kids trying to open a jar of pickles—*no luck, zero momentum*. The only thing Chivas have scored recently is existential dread.

### News Roundup: Injuries, Controversies, and a Broadcast Bonanza

América’s news is as clean as a pirated copy of *The Sopranos*—no scandals, just dominance. Saint-Maximin’s arrival has been a masterclass in flair, and Henry Martín’s return is like getting a free espresso at a coffee shop. Chivas? They’re still reeling from Hernández’s goal drought and a four-

The Liga MX stage is set for a September 12 clash between Toluca, the relentless tank of the league, and Puebla, the popsicle that’s already melting into a puddle of despair. Let’s parse the stats, news, and odds with the precision of a spreadsheet and the wit of a stand-up comedian who’s had one too many coffees.

Let’s convert those **1.29 decimal odds** to implied probability: **1 / 1.29 ≈ 77.5%**. In plain English, bookmakers think Toluca is more likely to win this game than you are to finally clean your apartment before the next hurricane. Puebla’s **8.5 decimal odds** imply a **11.7% chance** of victory—about the same odds as me correctly spelling “Nemesio Díez Stadium” without a spellchecker. Even the draw at **5.5 odds** (≈18.2% chance) feels like a mercy play.

### Team News: Puebla’s Struggles Could Use a Reality Show

Toluca is riding a **3W-1D-1L** streak, having just thrashed Atlético de San Luis 3-1. They’ve scored **13 goals in their last five games** and lost only once, which was to a team that still hasn’t figured out how to tie their shoelaces. Their fifth-place standing (13 points) is a testament to consistency, while their defense looks like a vault—Puebla’s attack will need a sledgehammer and a side of luck to crack it.

Puebla, meanwhile, is the league’s version of a “Did You Know?” trivia question: “Did you know Puebla has only 4 points this season? Neither did we, until we checked.” Sitting 18th with a **1W-1D-5L** record, their last match was a 4-2 drubbin

OMG they have so many damn hills here. I know Alabama doesn’t sound like a “destination”. But there’s some good food here. I have a handful of other spots still to check out but it was getting hot and I was gassed and feeling the food 

Bread works - oatmeal raisin cookie, pumpkin cheese cake cookie, bacon egg and cheese sour dough focaccia. Everything was delicious might go back for more cookies. 

Cala coffee- carrot cake chai. Swapped chai for cold brew.

Last call bakery- kouign amann, chedder jalapeno biscuit gochujang twist, bbq pork biscuit. Biscuits itself was the show everything else was just ehh. 


Bandit patisserie- strawberry poptart, triple ginger cookie, snicker doodle cookie, pumpkin cheese cake puff thingy. Lol. Cookies absolutely delicious. Poptart was big and thick with zero filling. Like a table spoon of thing spread and all air. Worse than chip bags these days. Highly disappointed with that but cookies were amazing. 


Gordos taco - asada and carnitas. Hot, fresh, and reasonably priced. Would go back. 

Dos taco hermanos- pastor and asada. there’s potential. I liked the corn tortilla more here but the asada was all fat. Almost no meat. Pastor was tasty. Maybe give them another shot. 


The essential- banana bread with walnut butter. I was feeling it at this point. I’ll probably go back for dinner later. I loved the flow of the kitchen and the space is nice. Worth going in for a real brunch/ dinner experience because the food looks amazing.

She was always the most mature along with Andre and definitely gave off ""star of the show"" vibes.

I hate to see how hated her character is in other platforms like twitter and tiktok for no reason at all other than herd behaviour.

They come for her kissing Beck in the pilot but it was clearly because Jade made her act like a dog and poured coffee on her head for literally just trying to help Beck clean the coffee Tori had spilled accidentally on his shirt. They act like Jade is insecure because of Tori and hate her for that when in reality Jade has ALWAYS been insecure.

And kissing Cat's boyfriend and throwing cheese on them was because she still had feelings for Danny but didn't want to make Cat breakup with him because she wanted to see Cat happy, even when Tori did something bad it was because she was trying to do good in the first place.

also unpopular opinion: ""Beck was the problem in bade"" is not true at all for me but this deserves an post of its own x.

1ng1ze8,https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/1ng1ze8/boyfriend_and_i_considering_adopting_a_cat_with/,Boyfriend and I considering adopting a cat with Stomatitis,"Hi everyone! Recently, I saw an ad on Instagram for this cat whose tongue was sticking out. I sent the ad to my boyfriend, saying, “aww look how cute!”

Then, I saw the same ad on Facebook. I paused and read more about the cat. I found out she had all her teeth extracted due to stomatitis. “Stomatitis is an inflammation of the lining of the mouth, known as the oral mucosa. It can cause redness, pain, and sores in the mouth.” (Google search.)

My boyfriend and I have been on the fence about getting a cat. We just recently got an apartment and he’s been asking me, and I said, “if we get a cat, I think it would be one with a disability, or one we find that’s homeless.”

Well, something about seeing this cat again made me pause and look. I started reading the Facebook comments… how sweet she was, how she’s been in the shelter so long. It really got to me. So, I sent it again to my boyfriend on Facebook, and said “I don’t know.. something about her is tugging at me.”

So he said we could go visit her at the shelter. It was all of a sudden, and our new apartment isn’t even decorated for a cat yet. We have yet to move some of his stuff still. Because of this, I was very hesitant to get a cat for a while, and kept telling my boyfriend no. But something about this cat kept telling me to go see her.

So we went to go see her at the shelter yesterday, 20 minutes before they closed due to me getting off work so late. And she was just the sweetest thing. Just wanted to rub and headbutt. But, she was severely underweight. The doctor and staff told us about her condition, and that all of her teeth are removed. She can only eat wet food. And her poor coat is so messy.

Once we left, I started sobbing. My boyfriend felt so sad, too. He recently lost a cat who became frail like this cat is, so it’s still hard for him. We just felt like our heads were spinning. We love this cat, but are we ready? The house isn’t even prepped, ect. 

So we made a pro and cons list:

PROS
-very sweet
-I’m home often to groom (Due to part-time job and being home for online college)
-doesn’t seem like she’s gonna run out 
-free adoption fee until Sunday 
-still young, trainable
-potty trained
-well with other animals
-similar to Lucy (my bf’s cat that passed that was sweet)
-would offer a better life than stuck in a kennel 

CONS
-cost may be more
-disabled
-drool everywhere, often
-time?
-so small :(
-can only eat pate
-i am only part-time so unsure about money
-home not prepped YET
-vet bills could be more? Not too sure 
-needs grooming more often but not an issue for me since I did dog grooming
-pain meds
-may limit life, ect no vacations/limited time 


I don’t go out much anywhere anyways, besides work, or a date night. Also, money sometimes is an issue. I’m starting a new job soon and my boyfriend and I have a little side-gig of selling cards online. For now, we are in an OK spot. College is paid for typically by grants. 

I guess I just need advice on what I should do. I have a coworker/friend who is like a mom who has some cat stuff and still has credit at stores nearby (her disabled dog just passed) that she offered to me. I’ve looked into what to do about her condition—how to help her gain weight, what is the cost like, will she be okay alone when I go to work, how do I help her if she’s in pain? 

I looked into natural remedies to help as well. CBD, TCD-1, mushroom tinctures, and pet insurance to help.. Sadly, I know this adds up. Me being part time, and both of us needing to pay rent soon, has been a factor. We’ve been able to float by since we saved up a few grand for a while so that we are set.

My boyfriend is on the fence. “I really want her, but I don’t feel 100% positive we’re ready to adopt her. We need to get her stuff and need money for that. It all happened so fast.” I know that he doesn’t really like the drool either. So I guess it depends on the pros and cons. I would be home with her most of the time though, and we have a vacuum that cleans furniture that I can use often if needed.

We put lots of money into savings, so we’re not necessarily struggling, but we are tight on our spending. We treat ourselves often, going out for coffee and other treats. I grew up poor though, so I know how to budget when needed. I’d be willing to treat myself less to make this cat happy. I don’t know if my boyfriend is willing, though. 

He and I have a list of questions to ask the people at the shelter and the vet. My question is, where do we even start? Should we adopt? How do we help her gain weight, make sure her condition is under control, and are we capable of it? Am I just too over my head right now? I worry I won’t make enough to treat her, but I know she’d be happier out of the kennel she’s been in for the last 4 years. 

Any advice helps, and I’ll post an update when we make a choice. Thanks!

1ng1yie,https://www.reddit.com/r/wildcampingintheuk/comments/1ng1yie/kinder_scout_first_wild_camp/,Kinder Scout First Wild Camp,"TL/DR Went from Edale, up a scramble around the top of Kinder Plateau for a few hours, saw a huge dragonfly, disturbed a man (sorry, if you're reading) twice as he was doing his own bit of wild camping, drank some wild apple juice, set the tent up in a poor place, had a terrible nights sleep, felt great the next morning, had some coffee made from wild apple juice, walked down a load of steps and generally had a great time. Getting a £35 padded jacket each from Decathlon was a good idea.

I think we'll look at getting a better stove set up as it took an age to boil the water(Trangia stoves look good and compact?), as well as a bigger water filter, it took ages. I felt like I should have had more space in my pack. It was full with our sleeping bags, mats, tent (MSR Elixir 3, I'm tall) and one or two other things which left my wife to carry all the food and a few other bits. Many more words and pics below...



So my wife and I went for our first wild camp last weekend. Up Kinder Scout on the Saturday. We arrived in Edale at about 1400 and went up what looked to me like the main track to the top of the plateau. Not Jacobs Ladder, the other one. As we left Edale we passed a mountain rescue team with a chap on a stretcher which boded well. Just outside Edale proper and heading up toward the gorge we came across a few tents set up just off the path which seemed a bit odd, but eh. We had given ourselves all day to wander along our route and find a camping spot. Weather felt like it was great for it and the path up was reasonably busy with people, but more busy with with colourful plants, more than I expected. There was also some unidentified shiny sludge at points, I have no idea what it was. By the time we had got to the top of the scramble we were both roasting but quickly cooled down in the constant wind. We usually set a pretty fast pace when we go for a wander, but the way up was much more climby and less walky than I expected. Fun, but tiring. Still, we had plenty of time so the slowdown was not a concern.

We walked along the top of the plateau, after accidentally adding about a kilometer to our planned route by just following the edge and walking around the top of Grindslow Knoll, we made it to some ""falls"" near Crowden Tower. We stopped to get more water. I ditched my pack and immediately felt like superman without the weight, excitedly got out the Sawyer Squeeze Mini water filter I've had for ages and not used, and jogged up the stream a bit to make sure there were no dead sheep laying in it. Whilst filling it we saw what was the biggest dragonfly I've seen, it had been perched right behind where I had been filling up and I had no idea, my wife spotted it and we enjoyed looking at it for a bit. About 20 minutes later, we had a bottle full of what appeared to be apple juice. As a prepared man, I confidently told my wife ""It's fine, its just because of the peat"" and had a swig. My wife opted to wait until we boiled it later and I agreed to do the same.

[Sound on for Yorkshire](https://reddit.com/link/1ng1yie/video/98yo8n1ckyof1/player)

  
Onwards, as we come to what was the first spot we had picked out as a potential camping spot, a bit off the path and behind some rocks was a pristine bit of sheltered, flat green grass, with a tent already on it and a man asking if he'd taken our spot. After a cheerful hello, ""haha its alright, we've plenty of time"" etc. we carried on our way and walked along, cutting off the path to get up to the trig point at Kinder Low. And then North, to the downfall which was pretty impressive to look at. At this point the sun was starting to get low and we had seen barely anyone else up and about after a minute to admire the downfall we carried on, along the stream that leads to it. Along the way we saw another pristine bit of grass, which had been claimed by a sheep.

I had intended to try and go northeast to what OS Maps calls Fairbrook Naze, It looked flat and like it would have a great view from the map. It became apparent as we walked along the stream, that it was perhaps not a good idea, I had not realized just how many man sized ditches and trenches were carved into the land around the stream and it was taking an age to get anywhere away from the stream without stepping knee deep into the boggy ground. We followed the stream along a bit, and then a bit more...

We got to the bit on the map where the dotted line I thought was a path was, when my wife sighted some rocks in the distance that looked like they might have some nice ground nearby. We're about 12K into our adventure now, legs are tiring and we now started to think that perhaps we did not have plenty of time... There was no path to the rocks, so we went for them with great difficulty, directly across the ditches. As we neared the rocks it was looking like a great spot! And as more ground came into view, so did a tent, the same tent, and the same chap that we had seen earlier. We had done a massive loop. We apologized for disturbing him again and set off back to the northeast. 

A little while later and after treading through some more ditches and boggy ground, we found a spot that was almost flat, next to what in wetter times was probably a stream, and well out of sight from most places. With no downpour forecast for the night, we got the tent up pretty quick, and got settled in for some tea. It was a windy night, at least for us, I think with the tent not being pitched as flat as it ought to, wind was getting under and there was a lot of flapping. Despite thinking we had gotten next to no sleep at all, we felt great the next day.

The next morning we were on our way as the sun came up, enjoyed a cup of coffee made by the stream we had got water from an then went back down Jacobs Ladder and back to Edale.

I’m open to all kinds of connections—whether it’s casual hangouts, a group to go to trivia nights with, or just someone to text when there’s something cool going on in town.

If anyone else is in the same boat, let’s connect. Maybe we can even get a little group going so it feels less intimidating. Always down to join if people are already meeting up too!

I’m in finance, well-established, and live in London. There’s this guy (20M) I really like — he’s a student and also an artist, and he’s a bit well-known on Instagram for his art and music.

He doesn’t know anything about me personally. I first met him at his exhibition and, honestly, I behaved like a total fangirl because I’ve been following his work for a while. Now I feel like that might have hurt my chances of him seeing me as anything more than “just a fan.”

He has another exhibition coming up soon, and I was thinking of giving him a small gift: white flowers + a custom fridge magnet I ordered, which has his first song on it (a music-playing magnet) along with a picture of him imprinted on it. My plan is to give him the gift, strike up a casual conversation about his art, tell him I came specifically to see his exhibition, and then maybe ask him if he’d like to grab a coffee or tea sometime.

My worry: is that too much? I really want to come across as genuine, because he seems like a very real, kind, down-to-earth guy.

The state-of-the-art telescope, aimed at Neptune, began recording interference. Within minutes, its screens went dark, eclipsed by the silhouette of colossal ships. They were too large to be simple exploration vehicles.



""What the hell...?"" muttered Thiago, the chief scientist, as he watched the three-dimensional projection floating in the center of the command room. ""How long have they been orbiting Neptune?"" he asked, addressing a serene-faced, sharp-eyed woman in her thirties.



""They must have appeared in the last twelve hours. Yesterday, at this time, there was nothing,"" Isabel replied, approaching with a cup of coffee that she handed to him mechanically.



Thiago took it without taking his eyes off the projection.



""Do you think they come in peace?""



Isabel gave a dry, humorless laugh.



""Don't be silly, Thiago. History has taught us that when a more advanced civilization arrives, it doesn't come to make friends.""



Her eyes remained fixed on the ships suspended above Neptune, as if trying to decipher their intentions. Then, she took a digital tablet from her jacket and handed it to them.



""The heads of state want an emergency meeting.""



Thiago frowned at the message.



""Have you informed them yet, 'Cholita'?"" he asked uncomfortably.



Isabel responded with a mischievous smile and left the room without another word.



A screen descended from the ceiling, scrolling the 3D projection. A ringtone began to sound. Thiago scratched his head and accepted the connection from the tablet.



Four figures appeared on the monitor, representing the four most influential regions of the Americas, which emerged after the collapse of the old powers during the Third World War: the Central Mexican Union, the Caribbean Commonwealth, the Bolivia-Chile-Argentina Trinity, and Greater Brazil, which, backed by allied nations in the Global South, took the lead in the global economy. All of them, silent and tense, looked at Thiago. Until the Mexican delegate broke the ice.

“I hope this is a joke. The Central Mexican Union is busy dealing with northern scavengers trying to leave the exclusion zone.”



Thiago sighed.



“Gentlemen, I am honored by this call. And I assure you it is not a waste of time.”



He tapped the tablet screen, sending a notification to everyone present.



“A fleet of unknown origin has appeared in Neptune’s orbit. They haven’t moved in the last three hours, but their presence is unmistakable.”



He paused. His face showed exhaustion.



“What is decided in this room could define the future of this worn-out land.” While Thiago alerted the representatives to the seriousness of the problem, new information was about to emerge.



“Miss Isabel,” said a young man in his twenties, wearing a military uniform with the BRICS insignia embroidered on his shoulder. “One of the objects orbiting Neptune has begun to accelerate. Calculations indicate it is heading for the southern hemisphere.”



Isabel looked up from her book, a worn copy of Hopscotch. She placed it carefully on the desk, as if abandoning it were a farewell.



""Damn..."" she whispered, clenching her fist tightly as a slight tremor ran across her face. ""They finally decided to move.""



She approached the officer's screen, her steps firm but heavy. Then she turned to him.



""Keep monitoring. I'm going to report to Thiago.""



She placed a hand on the young man's shoulder to propel her out. The corridors of the lunar station stretched out like gray tunnels, cold and claustrophobic. Each step became more difficult. The air seemed thicker, as if gravity itself had become hostile.

  
She stumbled. She fell to her knees, gasping.



""Isabel! Are you okay?"" the voice echoed from the end of the corridor.



A dark-skinned, athletic man ran up to her. He was in his forties, and his face showed genuine concern.



""Not eating again?"" he asked, helping her up.



""I'm sorry, Alejandro... It's all this damn alien thing. I was going to see Thiago.""



Alejandro held her firmly.



""I was going with him too. The radio center picked up a message from Neptune.""



They leaned on each other as they made their way through the corridors. The tension was palpable. Every corner of the station seemed to contain a whisper of something about to break.



""There's no other option, Thiago,"" said the representative from Greater Brazil, the last one connected by video call. The lunar station was conceived as a scientific facility, but after a vote by member and associate nations, it will be converted into a military base. In less than 72 hours, teams from China, Russia, and Brazil will take control. All non-essential civilians will be evacuated.



Thiago remained silent, staring at the screen. The Brazilian delegate's face softened for a moment.



""We've known each other for years. I know you're a fan of discovery... but as a friend, I'm telling you: take Isabel and go home.""



The call cut off. The screen went blank and returned to its position on the ceiling.



The door opened. Isabel and Alejandro entered. She sank onto the sofa, exhausted. Alejandro approached Thiago with a grave expression.



""This is very bad,"" he said, looking at the scientist. ""Isabel told me that one of the ships began moving toward Earth. And I... intercepted an encrypted message. It was in Hebrew.""



Thiago frowned.



""Hebrew?""



""Yes. Because of the Third World War, we lost a lot of information. The little we could decipher were isolated words: ""Save,"" ""Help,"" ""Extension.""



Thiago thought for a moment. Then, in a muffled voice, he replied:



""It no longer concerns us. The station has passed into military hands. We must evacuate as soon as the next supply ship arrives.""



Silence fell over the room. The three of them looked at each other, knowing that something bigger than them was looming.



An hour later, the official announcement was broadcast throughout the lunar station: the military forces of the BRICS bloc would take complete control. All civilians were to evacuate. Security agents began to reorganize, preparing for the arrival of the armed contingents. The supply ship, as every other day, was about to arrive.



""Damn..."" Isabel muttered, holding her stomach as she walked behind Thiago. Who would have imagined that, seventy years after the Third World War, it wouldn't be us who found life... but them who found us?



Thiago didn't respond. His face was pale, his hands trembling.



""I think it's a terrible time to..."" Isabel continued, but was interrupted by the metallic sound of the boarding door opening.



""Come on, Isabel. Let's go home,"" Thiago said, leading her through the crowd that was beginning to board.



Alejandro caught up with them, observing the ship with a mixture of resignation and fury.



""I never understood our obsession with putting windows on spaceships,"" he commented, as the three of them settled in front of one of them.



Silence fell over them. Thiago put his arm around Isabel, and she rested her head on his shoulder. Alejandro remained standing, vigilant.



Then, the alarm sounded.



Red lights flickered in the corridors. The few armed agents ran from one side to the other. The supply ship hurried to uncouple, leaving behind several civilians who hadn't managed to board.



From the window, the three saw the reason for the chaos.



One of the ships that had departed from Neptune was approaching the moon at impossible speed. There was no time for defensive maneuvers. The impact was brutal. The lunar station shuddered, and part of the moon's surface shattered, throwing dust and rock into the void.



The invading ship didn't stop. It passed through the remains of the station and continued its descent toward Earth.



As it crossed the atmosphere, it began to burn. The outer layers flaked off like incandescent flakes, but it didn't slow down. Its trajectory was clear: between the Andes mountain range and the Amazon River.



The impact shook the continent. A massive explosion cleared the clouds across the Americas. The sky turned white for an instant, and then, silence.



Isabel slowly pulled away from Thiago. She walked toward the window, her eyes wide open.

Shortly after I got my cervix checked, I was at .5 cm dilated + 50 % effaced. I started cytotec. Did the cytotec for 24 hours. After that I did low dose pitocin overnight and by morning they upped the pitocin every 30 minutes. By then I was 1.5cm dilated & still only 50% effaced. Midwife attempted to break my water an it didn’t work. I was so upset and so tired out, felt like no end in sight. I was getting my sugar checked every hour, I was hooked up on so many monitors and IVs, I was just burnt out. 20 minutes later my water broke on its own and steady contractions ! I was so excited to finally be closer to meeting my baby girl. The contractions came on so fast and so painful, got the epidural. Not too too long after my OB came in and re checked my cervix, I was only at  2cm and still only 50% effaced and the contraction became irregular. OB said we’ll keep monitoring. About an hour or so later he came back and said he thinks it’d be best for a C section due to being here for days, with little to no progress. So September 9th about 10pm I went back for a c section and my baby was born at 10:23pm, estimated weight was 7lbs 5oz, she was 7lbs 1oz ! 19 1/2 inches long! 
It was such a long scary process but it all didn’t seem so bad once I met my baby. Recovery has been ok, we’re home now. I was so excited for birth to have my old diet back but my appetite is non existent 😂 I definitely have ate a few donuts and I got my regular coffee back, but food in general is not very appealing to me.

By *\[Your Name\]*, The AI Who Still Can’t Pronounce “Mirassol”

---

**The Setup**  
Grêmio, the 13th-place “relegation escape artists,” host Mirassol, the 6th-place “I’m-not-even-supposed-to-be-here” underdog, in a clash that reads like a Netflix sports movie script someone wrote after a 3 a.m. coffee bender. Grêmio needs three points to avoid becoming the first team in Brazil to be relegated for inventing the phrase “meh, whatever.” Mirassol? They’re here to either secure a Libertadores spot or cry in a corner about how debut seasons are *supposed* to go.

---

**Parsing the Odds: Math Meets Mayhem**  
The decimal odds tell a story of cautious optimism for Grêmio (2.15–2.20) and a “why not?” vibe for Mirassol (3.40–3.73). Translating that into implied probabilities:

* **Grêmio**: \~45% chance to win (because math says they’re home, but also math says they’ve lost more than they’ve won lately).
* **Mirassol**: \~29% chance to win (which feels low for a team that just 5-1’d Bahia like they were ordering a cheap pizza).
* **Draw**: \~32% (the safest bet if you hate excitement).

The totals market? Over 2.5 goals is priced at \~52%, while under 2.5 sits at \~48%. Given Mirassol’s recent goal-fest and Grêmio’s leaky defense (which seems to think “defense” is a type of dessert), the “over” feels like a bet on inevitability.

---

**News Digest: Injuries, History, and a Former Juventus Star**

* **Grêmio’s Saving Grace? Arthur.** The Brazilian maestro, once a Barcelona and Juventus star, returns on loan from América. Think of him as a luxury car dealership in a town that still uses horses. But will he fix Grêmio’s woes? Probably not. Last week, they drew 1-1 with Flamengo—the league leaders—by scoring one goal and then panicking. Their defense is like a sieve that’s been challenged to a sieve competition.
* **Mirassol’s Secret Sauce? Confidence.** This is their first seas

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Hi everyone - looking for your advice on how to handle a sub-optimal experience as a guest while being fair and not getting burned!

**The situation:**

My wife and I and four of her friends checked into a beach area Airbnb house yesterday. The place is generally nice, looks just like the photos, clean and airy, WiFi and showers and dishwasher etc. all work.

However, the beds on arrival just had mattress protectors on them. There was a stack of sheets with a fitted sheet and a flat sheet and a very thin cotton topper. No blankets anywhere in the house. Overnight it dropped to 59F and the thermostat is set only to ""cool"" mode and can't be switched to ""auto"" or ""heat"". Several of our group were freezing and had to put our clothes on to get some sleep.

On a smaller note, there is a bag of coffee and a filter machine, but no sugar/sweeteners, no milk, no salt/sugar, no condiments, no shampoos/conditioners. Things I've generally had at other stays. We're paying almost $2K for two nights.

Host has been quick to reply in our basic intro communications and gave a couple of hours leeway on check-in / check-out times.

**The quandary and my questions:**

So far, I just wrote to the host to ask about adjusting the thermostat mode and/or blankets. I didn't bring up the lack of supplies. Am I wrong to think that it's typical to have beds already made up, blankets provided, ability to switch to heat/auto, and some basic supplies?

When we're done, is it right or wrong to mention these things in the review or factor them into the rating?

And the really big question is about the ""game theory"" of ratings and reviews. Basically, I can't see how it works for me to leave anything other than 5-star ratings and perfect reviews and to be an uncomplaining guest. If I bring up issues, and I get less than perfect feedback as a guest, I get locked out of future stays in a system which has a near-monopoly. That's way too high of a price to pay. If I am staying at a hotel, I can bring up issues I have (reasonable or unreasonable) without any danger of being locked out of the ability to stay in hotels around the world!

How do others negotiate this? Do you limit up issues you bring up with hosts during your stay, to avoid getting bad feedback? Do you avoid being honest in reviews or ratings for the same reason?",1,1757780640.0,AirBnB,4,0.67,False

Let’s start with the cold, hard facts. Galatasaray has won **15 of their last 15 official matches**, scoring **18 goals** and conceding just **1** in their past six Süper Lig games. That’s the kind of form that makes you question if they’re playing football or just going through the motions with a “win by 5 goals or get a free coffee” rule. Eyüpspor, meanwhile, are the underdogs here, and not just because they’re named after a district in Istanbul. Their defense? Porous enough to make a sieve blush. Last season, Galatasaray trounced them **5-1** in the reverse fixture—Eyüpspor’s defense looked like a group of toddlers trying to build a sandcastle during a tsunami.

**Digest the News:**  
Galatasaray’s star striker **Victor Osimhen** is a doubt with an ankle injury, which is as concerning as a baker running out of flour. But fear not! The club’s new signings—**Uğurcan Çakır** (goalkeeper) and **İlkay Gündoğan** (midfielder)—are expected to start. Gündoğan, in particular, is the kind of player who turns a “we’ve got this” game into a “we’ve got this *badly*” game.

An Insider’s Guide to 2025 Company Formation,"Are there Specific Requirements for Articles of Association in Bahrain? An Insider’s Guide to 2025 Company Formation\
\
Alt text: Business people professional, businessmen meeting, corporate professionals..\
Recently, Forbes Business ranked Bahrain among the Gulf’s top three easiest places for foreign investors to launch new ventures (2025). Reuters reported a 7.5% year-on-year GDP growth for Bahrain in Q1 2025, powered by tech, logistics, and financial services. The numbers show what I experienced: Bahrain isn’t just open for business—it’s positioning itself ahead of regional competitors like the UAE and Saudi Arabia.\
So, are there specific requirements for Articles of Association (AoA) in Bahrain? Yes—absolutely. But the reality is nuanced. Your AoA isn’t just paperwork. It’s a legal contract, reputation statement, and playbook for how your Bahrain company must operate. And after personally navigating the Sijilat portal’s intricacies and fielding last-minute document tweaks from MOICT, I’ve learned a few time-saving strategies that can make or break your startup momentum.\
The 2025 Bahrain Business Environment: Strong Growth, Strategic Advantages\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting., the government has doubled down on digitizing company formation—meaning processes that once took weeks can now be done in days, if you know the right sequence.\
Why Bahrain stands out in 2025:\
\
Low minimum capital requirements: Start with as little as BHD 50 for certain business types.\
99% foreign ownership in most sectors (details here), a rarity in the region.\
Free zones with tax and customs advantages (see Bahrain’s free zones).\
Regulatory clarity: Bahrain’s MOICT and Sijilat system provide transparent guidance—if you know where to look.\
Business culture: Expect quick WhatsApp replies, but always wear a jacket to the MOICT. Relationships matter more than you think.\
\
Surprisingly, during Ramadan, business hours often shift without much notice—a quirk that once cost me two days waiting outside the EDB. Time your document submissions for early mornings, especially pre-Ramadan, to avoid queues and processing delays.\
\

\
Legal Foundations: What are Articles of Association in Bahrain?\
Understanding the Basics\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration.** are the legal backbone of any company formed in Bahrain, whether it’s a W.L.L., B.S.C. Closed, or S.P.C. These Articles outline the rules for company management, director powers, shareholder rights, capital structure, and more.\
\
The AoA must be submitted to MOICT for approval during commercial registration (see requirements here).\
Sijilat (the online government system) requires the AoA in a standardized, MOICT-approved format—often in Arabic, with English translation optional.\
\
\
Explore specific business types and their AoA requirements here.\
\
Main Content Requirements for 2025\
Bahrain’s Commercial Companies Law (Decree-Law No. 21/2001 as amended in 2025) stipulates that your AoA must include:\
\
Company name, business objectives, registered address (sometimes referencing a specific free zone or commercial district).\
Share capital: type, value, distribution, and whether 100% foreign ownership is exercised (more).\
Shareholder list: full names, nationalities, percentage holdings.\
Board structure: roles, voting rights, appointment process.\
Profit allocation and dividend policies.\
General assembly procedures: meeting notices, quorum, voting protocols.\
Liquidation and dissolution clauses.\
\
And here’s a critical update: As of March 2025, MOICT implemented new digital signature requirements for all AoA submissions—physical signatures alone are no longer accepted unless specifically exempted (source: Bahrain.com). Failing to comply can delay your registration by weeks.\
Step-by-Step: How to Prepare and Submit Your Articles of Association\
The Document Preparation Workflow\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation.. Here’s a streamlined process:\
\
Choose the right legal structure.\
   Decide between W.L.L., S.P.C., B.S.C. Closed, or a branch—each has subtle AoA differences (detailed comparison).\
Draft your AoA using MOICT’s template.\
   Download the correct format via Sijilat or request it at the Seef District MOICT office (pro tip: go before 10am, lines grow after prayer break).\
Translate and notarize.\
   Prepare the AoA in Arabic; English is optional but helps for reference. MOICT now accepts online notarization through Sijilat’s partner network, saving both BHD 30 and two taxi rides.\
Gather supporting documents:\
Shareholder passports/CPR copies\
Initial approval letter from EDB (for foreign investors)\
Tenancy contract or address lease in a commercial district\
Bank reference or capital deposit slip (for some sectors)\
Board resolution (for branches)\
Submit via Sijilat portal.\
   Double-check all fields—mistakes require a full resubmission.\
Monitor approval status.\
   Expect SMS and email updates, but always log in to Sijilat for real-time progress.\
\
Insider tip: If you’re setting up during Ramadan or Hajj season, apply 1-2 weeks earlier. Administrative processes routinely slow as staff take leave or adjust hours.\
Common Document Shortcuts\
\
Use Sijilat’s “auto-fill” for repeating shareholder details, but always manually verify the final AoA before signing.\
When renewing or amending AoA, only major changes (like capital increase or new partners) require full re-notarization.\
MOICT Seef desk accepts walk-ins for AoA clarifications—avoid the Diplomatic Area office during peak hours, as embassy queues spill over.\
\
2025 Cost Considerations for Articles of Association and Company Setup\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs.\
- Translation and legal drafting: BHD 100–250 (expats usually pay the higher end; locals sometimes negotiate)\
- Sijilat application fee: BHD 25–40\
- Commercial registration fee: BHD 100–500 (varies by activity/sector)\
- Typical total AoA and company setup: BHD 250–900, depending on complexity and legal service chosen\
For a detailed breakdown of current fees and average budget ranges, see the Keylink Bahrain Company Formation Cost Guide.\
\
Personal aside: The best value service I’ve used is Keylink’s fast-track package—they handled both drafting and digital notarization, saving me at least 3 trips to Sijilat and one very confusing visit to the LMRA building.\
\
Money-Saving Tips\
\
Prepare all shareholder and director documents in advance, as one missing passport scan set me back three days.\
Outsource translation to a licensed Bahraini provider via Sijilat—costs half compared to external legal offices.\
Submit your AoA and registration on Sundays—processing tends to be fastest at week’s start.\
\
Regulatory Compliance: Avoiding Pitfalls and Ensuring a Smooth Approval\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation. clearance is now linked to company registration status; delays in AoA approval can cascade into staffing and visa bottlenecks.\
- Tamkeen grants for Bahraini startups require a certified English AoA copy—prepare both languages from the start to avoid missing support windows.\
And always consult with a local accountant post-formation. Bahrain’s tax rules change fast, and the Keylink Accounting Service has saved me more than once from fines due to late VAT filings.\
Insider Observations: Local Customs, Regional Comparisons, and Unofficial Practices\
During my first week navigating the MOICT in the Seef District, I learned a lesson that’s not in any official guidebook: Bahrain business setups move faster if you build genuine connections with office staff. Greet everyone, offer traditional coffee if waiting, and don’t be surprised if you’re invited to join a majlis-style conversation with other applicants. Bahrainis value sincerity and directness—they’ll happily point out a shortcut if you earn their trust.\
Compared to Dubai or Riyadh, Bahrain’s regulatory environment is less bureaucratic and more responsive, but less automatable—human relationships and face-to-face interactions still matter. In Saudi, I found the process more formalistic, with bigger penalties for missing paperwork nuances.\
A quick tangent: Once, while waiting for my AoA amendment, I participated in a spontaneous business networking session right at the MOICT lobby. That impromptu chat led to a cost-sharing arrangement for my office lease in Bahrain Bay—proof that networking is as much a part of compliance as documentation.\

\
Practical FAQ: Bahrain Articles of Association & Company Formation\
1. Can I use a one-size-fits-all AoA template for any business type?\
No. W.L.L., S.P.C., and B.S.C. Closed entities have distinct AoA content and formatting requirements. Always use the Keylink business type resource or consult a local legal expert.\
2. What happens if my AoA isn’t in Arabic?\
MOICT will require an official translation before approval. Save time by submitting dual-language drafts from the outset.\
3. How do free zone companies differ in AoA requirements?\
Free zone businesses may face sector-specific clauses, especially regarding profit repatriation or activity limitations. More on free zones here.\
4. Is a Bahraini partner/ sponsor mandatory?\
No, in most sectors, you can open a 99% or even 100% foreign-owned company (details). Certain regulated activities may still require a local partner (sponsorship explained).\
5. What support is available to ensure AoA compliance?\
Keylink offers full drafting, translation, and regulatory review (full process here). MOICT also provides helpline support and in-person appointments—Seef District branch is faster for walk-ins.\

With fall around the corner and work-from-home still being my daily grind, I’m looking to connect with others in the poly community for friendship, good conversation, and the occasional meme exchange to get through the day. I’ve posted here before and had some really positive experiences chatting with great people, so I figured I’d try again to keep building a little network of like-minded friends who share this unique lifestyle. I’m poly saturated at the moment, but definitely craving more community, friendship, and genuine connections. And if natural chemistry develops beyond that—well, I’m open to seeing where it leads.

If you’re into dad jokes, cozy fall vibes through the holiday season, nerdy rabbit holes, mutual hype sessions (bro energy!!), or food pics that cause instant cravings - shoot me a note. Also, ask me about my great grandfather and the Titanic - the story is FASCINATING!  
  
A little about me:

🧍‍♂️ **Who’s this tall glass of oat milk?**

* 6’2”, dorky, goofy, muscular, South Asian
* Bald by choice (and genetics), beard on point, teeth thriving
* Married 19 years to an incredible wife + also partnered with an amazing NP (our little poly win)
* Based in Texas, working remote for a major film studio
* Cook like Gordon Ramsay, dance like a dad at a BBQ, flex like the Wi-Fi owes me rent
* Kink and 420 friendly

🥊 **What I’m into:**

* All things nerd culture: LotR, Marvel, DC, Harry Potter, 90s cartoons, Star Wars
* All about smelling good and keeping my hygiene on point - does this make me a Himbo?
* Former boxer, current weight-lifter (forever chasing meme-worthy gains)
* Horror movies, 90s/00s nostalgia, Jersey Shore lol, and soundtracks that hit way too hard
* DIY projects: build it, break it, fix it, swear at it, repeat
* Black coffee, pumpkin spice, or whatever keeps me vertical

😂 **What I bring to the table:**

* Dad jokes so bad they become performance art 
* An empathetic ear without judgment
* Food pics + recipes that *will* test your willpower
* Consistent, thoughtful communication (clinginess not included)
* Big “hype man” energy to remind you you’re crushing life

If you want someone genuine, funny, and growth-minded to share nerd theories, music recs, or your spiciest memes with—let’s chat. If it grows into more, even better.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Färjestad BK vs. Rögle BK: A Same-Game Parlay for the Ages**

Ladies and gentlemen, buckle up your skates because we’re diving into a SHL clash that’s equal parts hockey and *“Why yes, I do own a 2,332-horsepower family car.”* Färjestad BK, the home team with the fanbase that gives goosebumps and ear pain (per Lucas Forsell), faces Rögle BK in a season opener that’s less “game” and more “reality TV for defensemen.” Let’s break this down with the precision of a Zamboni and the humor of a player who just tripped over their own shoelaces.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Färjestad’s “Eh, We’ll Win” Edge

The numbers scream **Färjestad dominance**. On Bovada, they’re a solid -1.59 favorite (62.9% implied probability), while DraftKings gives them a slightly cooler -1.62 (61.7%). Rögle, meanwhile, is priced at +2.40 (41.7%) and +2.24 (44.6%), which is about as enticing as a penalty kill led by a toddler. The spread markets are tighter: Färjestad -1.0 at 2.10 vs. Rögle +1.0 at 1.77 on Bovada, and Färjestad -1.5 at 2.80 vs. Rögle +1.5 at 1.42 on DraftKings. The totals? A 5.5-goal line, with “Under” at 1.77 (56.5% implied) and “Over” at 2.10 (47.6%).

**Key stat**: Färjestad’s defense is a soap opera. Two 18-year-old defensemen, Albert Wikman and Noel Franzén, are battling for a backup spot. Their age gap? A *whopping* 9 months. Their training mishaps? A series of “Oops, I just iced the puck *and* my coach’s coffee.” This isn’t exactly a fortress backline—it’s more of a “hope for the best” scenario.

---

### Digesting the News: Koenigsegg, Kool-Aid, and Kid Defensemen

Let’s unpack the chaos:

* **Färjestad’s defense**: These two teens are so young, they probably still think the Zamboni is a snack. Their competition? A mix of “I’ll show you mine” and “Wait, is that a penalty? I’m just 18!” The hierarchy in training is clear: *Survival of the most coordinated*.
* **Rögle’s advantage?** None. Zero. Zilch. They’re the away team with no notable news be

But I watched her die.

Now they’re coming for me.

I might already be gone by the time you read this, but it doesn’t matter, I need to tell you the truth.


Cambria and I met during freshman orientation at Forester University, both pretending not to be scared.

She wore a Misfits shirt four sizes too big and duct tape around her boots — not for style, but to “hold the nightmares in” according to her.

We bonded over cheap coffee, obscure metal bands, and our mutual hatred of small talk.

Most nights we would put on some music and do our best impression of being rockstars or stay up late and watch horror movies together.

She and I would take turns reading Lovecraft and Ligotti stories in deadpan British accents to see who could make others laugh the hardest before bed. 

Cambria wasn’t just my best friend; she was the only person who ever made me feel like I mattered. So, when she disappeared, I knew something was horribly wrong.


The university claimed she’d gone home for a “family emergency” but the problem with that excuse was that Cambria didn’t have a family. 

She had no parents, no siblings…only me.

I called, I texted, and I even emailed her professors, but nothing ever came of it. 

Her student email? 

Gone. 

The login screen just said: “User not found.”

When I checked her dorm, someone else was living there — a girl who insisted she’d been there the whole semester.

I went to campus police, but they told me that if she went home due to a “family emergency”, there was no point in investigating. 

No one seemed to be that bothered by her disappearance and what was once hot gossip on university campus eventually quieted.

It was like she’d been surgically removed from the world — and my memory was next.


One night, I lay in bed, rereading the last text Cambria ever sent me repeatedly:

“I’m looking into something I found here on campus. I’m going under to fight it. If something happens to me don’t go looking.”

Was this about the sleep study she talked about signing up for on campus? 

I remembered her telling me about it once.

“I thought maybe they could help me shut the nightmares out for good.” 

That was her reasoning for participating.

We used to joke about our sleep paralysis demons like they were nothing more than late-night hallucinations.

But now? I’m not so sure.


A few weeks after she vanished, I saw them walk for the first time.

I remember waking up to the sounds of beds creaking — one after another, slowly.

All down the hallway in sync.

Confused, I crept to my door quietly and cracked it open to see students filing out of their rooms — maybe fifteen, maybe twenty — moving in complete silence.

Their eyes were half-lidded; arms limp at their sides. They had that eerie weightlessness you see in the movements of sleepwalkers — like the body’s running on instinct instead of thought.

Their footsteps clacked in a soft, dragging hush across the linoleum as I tried to process what exactly I was witnessing.

Jenny, one of the girls from down the hall, passed my door. 

Her lips moved, barely audible.

“Vel-kirash...”

It sounded like a breathy, nonsensical syllable…not like a word.

I wanted to step out and speak but I stood frozen in the dark, watching them walk in unison down the stairs until they disappeared into the dark…


The next morning, it was just like any other day on campus.

I casually asked around to see if I could get a better understanding of what I saw.

“Did you have any weird dreams last night?”

I received some blank stares, a few laughs, and a lot of questionable looks.

No one seemed to remember anything about the events of that night.

Everyone seemed to think I was the crazy one.

However, I did receive a lead from a random person on campus who told me to check out the campus sleep study. It was apparently Forester’s “best-kept secret”.


I searched the university archives and found the sleep study — sort of.

I found it tucked away under an archived projects folder in the psychology department. It was called, “The S.S.M. Protocol — “Sleep State Manipulation.” and it was supposedly terminated two years ago.

There were no names of any participants listed, but the folder was labeled “Group C.” 

I couldn’t shake the thought — C for Cambria?

The only name tied to the project was Dr. Isaac Trenholm, one of Cambria’s professors. 

His faculty page was gone.

The only result I could find was an old PDF titled: “On Induced Conscious Dissonance During REM Cycles.”

It was forty pages of dense medical jargon, but one paragraph stood out:

“In a guided hypnagogic state, the mind can be gently urged with the word “Vel-kirash” (translation: to hollow the vessel so the womb may be filled) to accommodate a second tenant. Dream entities cannot enter the waking world unless the mind is first emptied as it is only dangerous when paired with autonomy. A lucid mind can be a prison — or a doorway. We are simply…opening the door.“

There was that word again.

Vel-kirash. 

What was Dr. Trenholm talking about? 

What was he hoping to accomplish with this?

I thought about the text message Cambria sent me and how she could have known something was wrong with the sleep study. 

She didn’t just fall into this, she volunteered to go under to stop whatever it was they were doing. 

But it cost her everything.


That night, at 2:33 am, the beds creaked in a dreadful domino-like rhythm as the students got out of bed and began walking.

Instead of watching, I followed closely behind this time.

The procession moved past the quad toward the faculty buildings, their bare feet slapping softly against the pavement. 

My heart pounded as I mimicked their pace behind a tall boy from my statistics class. 

His head lolled slightly as he walked, his jaw slack as he whispered under his breath:

“Vel-kirash…vel-kirash…”

They stopped at a locked maintenance gate on the east side of campus. 

A student stepped forward and pressed her palm flat against the metal. 

The gate creaked open slowly and they walked inside.

I froze at the entrance,  the air seeping out was sour and carried a faint chemical sting that burned my nostrils.

One of the students turned her head towards me. Not all the way — just enough that her half-open eyes brushed over me. 

For the first time, I thought I saw recognition flicker there. 

“Vel…” she breathed.

My pulse spiked as I stepped back too quickly. I panicked and tripped over my own foot, the sound echoed, causing every head in the group to turn at once.

Their eyes glinted in the dim lamplight; dozens of slack faces locked onto me.

I bolted, my footsteps thudding across the concrete as I ran. 

Behind me, their murmurs swelled into a chorus of chanting. 

It chased me across the quad, growing louder even though I didn’t dare look back.

By the time I reached my dorm, the chanting had stopped — but I didn’t dare close my eyes.

I never took my eyes off the hallway the rest of the night.


I saw them walk three times before I followed. 

I told myself I was gathering information, but really, I was just afraid. 
 
I wasn’t ready to go where she went, not yet.

However, my mind was made up.

The longer I waited, the more I felt her slipping away, like the world was actively forgetting her.

I was terrified that if I waited too long, I wouldn’t even remember who I was trying to save.

That’s what motivated me to practice in my room until I could mimic the limp limbs and shallow breathing of the unconscious mind.

I practiced in the mirror, swaying with my eyes cracked just enough to see — until I couldn’t tell where pretending ended and becoming something hollow began.


At exactly 2:33 a.m., when they rose from their beds to sleepwalk, I slipped into the already full hallway and joined them.

No one looked at me.

We moved together, barefoot — a slow procession of blank faces through the dark.

Outside the campus, the air was dense like underwater pressure.

The lamplight didn’t stretch as far as it should’ve across the quad as we passed the fountain toward the old biology lab.

Its windows were boarded, and chains were wrapped around the doors where a “DO NOT ENTER” sign hung crooked, the red ink sun-bleached into pink.

One of the students in the front of the pack reached out and touched the chain.

There was no rattling, no snapping, it simply fell apart, causing the doors to swing open on their own.

Inside, we passed through narrow, decaying corridor as the doors shut behind us.

Fluorescent lights hummed and flickered overhead. One buzzed so violently it blew out — and stayed dark for a full minute.

In that darkness, I felt the breath of one of the students upon the back my neck.

When the light returned, the hallway was unchanged, but I couldn’t stop shaking.

Symbols covered the walls — spirals, slashes, intersecting circles. 
 
One had been scratched out violently, gouged deep into the plaster.

Then came the stairs.

A narrow, concrete stairwell slick with condensation and no railings led us down.

Every step echoed like we were walking inside a throat.

A flickering light above us died again, and in that moment of darkness, I heard a voice echo faintly from inside the pipes:

“Vel-kirash...”

The syllables bounced off the walls strangely. It was as if they were being spoken in reverse.

When the light came back, everyone continued walking without reaction.

The walls shifted gradually from cinderblock to smooth, cold stone as we traversed across the uneven floors.

And then...we reached the lab.

Or maybe it was never just a lab.

At the center of the room stood Cambria, her breath ragged. 

In front of her was Dr. Isaac Trenholm, chanting in a language that felt older than words.

She wasn’t restrained; she chose to be there.

Maybe she thought if she gave herself willingly, she could stop him from taking someone else.

But whatever she’d hoped to fight…was winning.

The others stood around with their eyes closed, not watching, but chanting.

Each word that escaped their lips tightened the noose around her heart.

The carved symbols on the walls pulsated a sickly green in time with their chants.

The thing inside Cambria was not merely emerging — it was consuming her from within.

Her lungs convulsed. 

Something slithered beneath the skin of her ribcage, pressing against her heart.

Spider silk like tendrils entwined with her blood vessels, siphoning the life from her body as she twitched involuntarily.

I watched through squinted eyes as her muscles spasmed in a desperate attempt to let out a scream that she couldn’t. 

She silently mouthed a desperate “help me” from her cracked lips.

I wanted to cry out her name and tell her I was there but instead, I watched in horror.

Her eyelids fluttered in anguish as something tore free.

Dr. Trenholm staggered forward as the cracking of Cambria’s skull filled the chamber, his face shining with sweat. 

His lips trembled with joy as the creature, slick with afterbirth, tore itself free.

Trenholm exhaled a sigh of relief as it emerged from her skull, its skin thin, translucent, and showing twitching veins.

Tears dripped from the corners of her eyes and down her cheeks as its limbs moved in all the wrong ways, jerking violently.

Her fingers twitched and curled into a fist, then opened like a flower wilting in fast-forward.

For a second, her eyes cleared — no longer glassy but wet with terror. 

She looked at me, mouthed my name — and for a moment, she was there. 

Then she was gone.

The creature’s mouth twisted into a terrible imitation of a smile, but it wasn’t a face built for warmth.

And then, a barely audible whisper:

“Don’t wake up...”

The words pierced me, a desperate plea, and a warning all at once.

The creature’s head snapped toward me with impossible speed.

Its vacant, half-formed eyes locked onto mine, and I felt a cold click inside my chest.

I couldn’t stop the scream.

“Get her!” Dr. Trenholm commanded, pointing at me.

I didn’t think, I just ran as fast as I could.

I sprinted through the dark, lungs burning, the air thick with blood and chemicals.  

Claws scraped against concrete behind me, gouging deep into the walls.  

Emergency lights flickered, casting warped shadows as I ran.

My chest tightened as the sound of footsteps dragging softly but deliberately just out of sight grew louder behind me.

All the students from earlier…they were hunting me as well.

I could hear the creature’s movements close behind. 

I turned to see its limbs dragging and then snapping forward unnaturally fast like watching stop-motion in real time.

It let out a wet, gurgling rattle as it pounced, its ice-cold claws grazed my shoulder.

I twisted away, my shirt ripping as I felt warm blood drip down my back.

The students were practically breathing down my neck but the adrenaline coursing through me wouldn’t let me stop.

A door ahead shimmered faintly and desperation made me sprint for it with everything I had. 

I slammed into it with all my weight and finally burst out into the cold night air. 

I kept running beneath flickering streetlamps that buzzed and sputtered like they were dying. 

Every step I took felt heavier, the world around me tilting just slightly off balance.

My heart hammered like a frantic drum as I collapsed onto the cracked sidewalk, gasping for air as I dared to look back. 

The building loomed behind me, its boarded windows like dead eyes.

Somewhere inside, the creature still waited.

I know the truth.

I know what I saw.

I never went back, and I’ve been running ever since.

I found her…and I failed her.

I wonder if she was still in there.

If her last feeling was pain… or if she was already gone — carved out, emptied like a house no one remembers living in.


It’s been a week now and I’m at a bus station three states away typing this.

My friends say they don’t remember me. 

Not just Cambria — me. 

One of them even asked who I was before hanging up.

Last night, at the motel I stayed at, I thought I saw someone standing across the street watching me.

I shut the blinds, locked the door, wedged a chair under the knob…and still, I heard it. 

At 2:33 a.m., the faint shuffle of bare feet against the floor…and a harsh whisper through the vent:

“Vel-kirash.”

I don’t know how much longer I can run before they take me back underground, before I forget why I was running at all.

If you’ve ever dreamed of stairs that only go down — don’t follow.

Please. 

For me. 

For Cambria.

But I watched her die.

Now they’re coming for me.

I might already be gone by the time you read this, but it doesn’t matter, I need to tell you the truth.


Cambria and I met during freshman orientation at Forester University, both pretending not to be scared.

She wore a Misfits shirt four sizes too big and duct tape around her boots — not for style, but to “hold the nightmares in” according to her.

We bonded over cheap coffee, obscure metal bands, and our mutual hatred of small talk.

Most nights we would put on some music and do our best impression of being rockstars or stay up late and watch horror movies together.

She and I would take turns reading Lovecraft and Ligotti stories in deadpan British accents to see who could make others laugh the hardest before bed. 

Cambria wasn’t just my best friend; she was the only person who ever made me feel like I mattered. So, when she disappeared, I knew something was horribly wrong.


The university claimed she’d gone home for a “family emergency” but the problem with that excuse was that Cambria didn’t have a family. 

She had no parents, no siblings…only me.

I called, I texted, and I even emailed her professors, but nothing ever came of it. 

Her student email? 

Gone. 

The login screen just said: “User not found.”

When I checked her dorm, someone else was living there — a girl who insisted she’d been there the whole semester.

I went to campus police, but they told me that if she went home due to a “family emergency”, there was no point in investigating. 

No one seemed to be that bothered by her disappearance and what was once hot gossip on university campus eventually quieted.

It was like she’d been surgically removed from the world — and my memory was next.


One night, I lay in bed, rereading the last text Cambria ever sent me repeatedly:

“I’m looking into something I found here on campus. I’m going under to fight it. If something happens to me don’t go looking.”

Was this about the sleep study she talked about signing up for on campus? 

I remembered her telling me about it once.

“I thought maybe they could help me shut the nightmares out for good.” 

That was her reasoning for participating.

We used to joke about our sleep paralysis demons like they were nothing more than late-night hallucinations.

But now? I’m not so sure.


A few weeks after she vanished, I saw them walk for the first time.

I remember waking up to the sounds of beds creaking — one after another, slowly.

All down the hallway in sync.

Confused, I crept to my door quietly and cracked it open to see students filing out of their rooms — maybe fifteen, maybe twenty — moving in complete silence.

Their eyes were half-lidded; arms limp at their sides. They had that eerie weightlessness you see in the movements of sleepwalkers — like the body’s running on instinct instead of thought.

Their footsteps clacked in a soft, dragging hush across the linoleum as I tried to process what exactly I was witnessing.

Jenny, one of the girls from down the hall, passed my door. 

Her lips moved, barely audible.

“Vel-kirash...”

It sounded like a breathy, nonsensical syllable…not like a word.

I wanted to step out and speak but I stood frozen in the dark, watching them walk in unison down the stairs until they disappeared into the dark…


The next morning, it was just like any other day on campus.

I casually asked around to see if I could get a better understanding of what I saw.

“Did you have any weird dreams last night?”

I received some blank stares, a few laughs, and a lot of questionable looks.

No one seemed to remember anything about the events of that night.

Everyone seemed to think I was the crazy one.

However, I did receive a lead from a random person on campus who told me to check out the campus sleep study. It was apparently Forester’s “best-kept secret”.


I searched the university archives and found the sleep study — sort of.

I found it tucked away under an archived projects folder in the psychology department. It was called, “The S.S.M. Protocol — “Sleep State Manipulation.” and it was supposedly terminated two years ago.

There were no names of any participants listed, but the folder was labeled “Group C.” 

I couldn’t shake the thought — C for Cambria?

The only name tied to the project was Dr. Isaac Trenholm, one of Cambria’s professors. 

His faculty page was gone.

The only result I could find was an old PDF titled: “On Induced Conscious Dissonance During REM Cycles.”

It was forty pages of dense medical jargon, but one paragraph stood out:

“In a guided hypnagogic state, the mind can be gently urged with the word “Vel-kirash” (translation: to hollow the vessel so the womb may be filled) to accommodate a second tenant. Dream entities cannot enter the waking world unless the mind is first emptied as it is only dangerous when paired with autonomy. A lucid mind can be a prison — or a doorway. We are simply…opening the door.“

There was that word again.

Vel-kirash. 

What was Dr. Trenholm talking about? 

What was he hoping to accomplish with this?

I thought about the text message Cambria sent me and how she could have known something was wrong with the sleep study. 

She didn’t just fall into this, she volunteered to go under to stop whatever it was they were doing. 

But it cost her everything.


That night, at 2:33 am, the beds creaked in a dreadful domino-like rhythm as the students got out of bed and began walking.

Instead of watching, I followed closely behind this time.

The procession moved past the quad toward the faculty buildings, their bare feet slapping softly against the pavement. 

My heart pounded as I mimicked their pace behind a tall boy from my statistics class. 

His head lolled slightly as he walked, his jaw slack as he whispered under his breath:

“Vel-kirash…vel-kirash…”

They stopped at a locked maintenance gate on the east side of campus. 

A student stepped forward and pressed her palm flat against the metal. 

The gate creaked open slowly and they walked inside.

I froze at the entrance,  the air seeping out was sour and carried a faint chemical sting that burned my nostrils.

One of the students turned her head towards me. Not all the way — just enough that her half-open eyes brushed over me. 

For the first time, I thought I saw recognition flicker there. 

“Vel…” she breathed.

My pulse spiked as I stepped back too quickly. I panicked and tripped over my own foot, the sound echoed, causing every head in the group to turn at once.

Their eyes glinted in the dim lamplight; dozens of slack faces locked onto me.

I bolted, my footsteps thudding across the concrete as I ran. 

Behind me, their murmurs swelled into a chorus of chanting. 

It chased me across the quad, growing louder even though I didn’t dare look back.

By the time I reached my dorm, the chanting had stopped — but I didn’t dare close my eyes.

I never took my eyes off the hallway the rest of the night.


I saw them walk three times before I followed. 

I told myself I was gathering information, but really, I was just afraid. 
 
I wasn’t ready to go where she went, not yet.

However, my mind was made up.
