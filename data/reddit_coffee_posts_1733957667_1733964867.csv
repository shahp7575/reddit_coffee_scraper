In 1932, Izaak Killam, then the wealthiest man in Canada and now the namesake of prestigious scholarships, helped facilitate a genocide of indigenous peasants who threatened his business interests in El Salvador.
","[https://www.readthemaple.com/the-imperialist-massacre-behind-one-of-canadas-most-prestigious-academic-institutions/](https://www.readthemaple.com/the-imperialist-massacre-behind-one-of-canadas-most-prestigious-academic-institutions/) (the article is members only, so I will paste everything here)

It was January 1932, and the richest man in Canada had a serious problem.

Nova Scotia-born Izaak Walton Killam had made his millions through pulp, paper and hydro-electric projects across Latin America. His Montreal-based International Power company controlled a monopoly on electrical power in El Salvador and charged extremely high rates on the country‚Äôs exploited workers.

When these Indigenous peasants began an organized uprising, Killam called in a personal favour to protect his capital. This would end in a civilian massacre that would usher in decades of military dictatorship, and ultimately help establish prestigious cornerstones of Canadian arts, culture and academics.

El Salvador‚Äôs economy in 1932 was controlled by colonial coffee, railway and electricity companies that worked the country‚Äôs Indigenous peasants in gruelling conditions for meagre wages. A United States army major stationed there once remarked, ‚Äúthere appears to be nothing between these high-priced cars, and the oxcart with its barefoot attendant ‚Ä¶ there is practically no middle class.‚Äù

This state of affairs that allowed for Killam‚Äôs monopoly was enforced by the military dictatorship of General Maximiliano Hernandez Martinez, who had come to power in a coup d‚Äôetat in late 1931.

As part of legitimizing his rule, Martinez initially invited all parties, including the Communist Party, to participate in open elections at all levels of government.

These started with municipal elections on January 5, 1932, where the Communist Party saw several landslide victories in the face of intimidation tactics. The wins scared the Martinez dictatorship so badly that he not only nullified the results, but cancelled the promised upcoming federal election completely.

Salvadoran workers began an uprising, led by folk heroes like the Marxist-Leninist Augustin Farabundo Marti.

Groups of peasants, many of them from the Pipil Indigenous nation, seized plantations, military barracks and entire villages in a show of rebellion. These Indigenous groups and communists began directly targeting companies like Killam‚Äôs International Power with boycotts, strikes and demonstrations.

Meanwhile, the dictatorship was nearly broke and unable to pay its soldiers, whose morale was so low that they were threatening to defect and even join the rebellion. Killam saw his monopoly in El Salvador was facing a dire situation. And so, after extending a generous loan to the dictatorship, he called in help from a dear friend.

That friend was Canadian Prime Minister Richard Bedford Bennett. Killam asked Bennett if the Canadian military could intervene in the Salvadoran crisis, and recognizing the importance of Canadian capital in the region, Bennett happily obliged. The Royal Canadian Navy deployed the destroyers Skeena and Vancouver to help the Salvadoran dictatorship ‚Äúsafeguard life and property‚Äù against what Bennett called ‚Äúcommunist Indians.‚Äù

Quebec-born Commander Victor Brodeur anchored his ships in the harbour outside the port city of Acajutla, leaving a fully armed landing party on standby while he went ashore to meet Martinez. Upon witnessing Salvadoran Indigenous workers making 12 cents per day, Brodeur remarked in his diary it was ‚Äúhardly to be wondered that Communism made many converts‚Äù of the country‚Äôs workers.

Martinez was reportedly overjoyed to meet Brodeur, seeing the arrival of Canadian gunships as a turning point in the conflict. Not only did it give the army extra firepower, it symbolized a direct endorsement from the British Empire. Brodeur boasted that Canada‚Äôs visible presence in the harbour had a ‚Äúwonderful morale effect‚Äù for the dictatorship‚Äôs soldiers, as well as a menacing warning to the outgunned peasants.

Brodeur enthusiastically offered to land Canadian soldiers and have them directly participate in the crackdown. However, Martinez declined, wishing to establish a strong and ruthless image for his new dictatorship. Brodeur instead helped Martinez‚Äôs army strategize and according to different sources, either had his landing parties fortify on the beach or stand by in the destroyers as potential reinforcements.

In the end, Canadian soldiers did not need to fire a shot.

What followed is known in El Salvador today as ‚ÄúLa Matanza,‚Äù or simply ‚ÄúThe Massacre.‚Äù Between January 23-25, 1932, approximately 25,000 Salvadoran peasants were murdered by government forces, including the public execution of freedom fighter Marti. The overwhelming majority of those killed were Pipil, some of whom were made to dig their own graves before being executed.

The Salvadoran military‚Äôs colonial-financed weapons and training would be a decisive factor, with witnesses describing ‚Äúwaves of Indians, blown away by machine guns.‚Äù Martinez‚Äôs chief of operation proudly informed Brodeur that Canadian troops would not be needed, assuring that ‚Äúcomplete extermination (would) be achieved.‚Äù When Brodeur surveyed the aftermath, he observed that many of the corpses were holding white flags of surrender.

The dictatorship‚Äôs top brass thanked Brodeur with a celebratory luncheon, which he called ‚Äúexceedingly good.‚Äù He even stuck around the next day to play a round of golf with Martinez and other military officials.

Reflecting on the events in his diary, Brodeur blamed the peasants for their own poverty, remarking, ‚Äúit is one of the outstanding characteristics of the Central American Indian that he is incapable of saving money ‚Ä¶ he spends it at once in the nearest cantina.‚Äù Yet the only Indigenous Salvadorans Brodeur met were surrendered corpses on the beach.

The Canadian media played up the navy‚Äôs supposed heroics. In the ensuing days, the Globe published articles claiming that Canada had rescued white women from ‚Äúred hordes,‚Äù and declared in an editorial: ‚ÄúReds making trouble. Foreign population in peril (with) no protection ‚Ä¶ The Dominion (of Canada‚Äôs) fleet is roaming the seas in search of adventure; and finding it.‚Äù

The Royal Canadian Navy had indeed found adventure, aiding a capitalist dictatorship in one of the worst civilian massacres ever recorded on Turtle Island.

La Matanza continued until July 11, 1932, with a final death count of over 40,000. Martinez remained in power for more than a decade afterwards, vocally supporting the fascist governments of Spain, Italy, Japan and Nazi Germany throughout the 1930s.

Salvadorans would endure another 50 years of brutal western-backed far-right military rule, followed by 13 years of civil war during which an estimated 75,000 Indigenous activists, union supporters, communists, Catholic clergy and other leftists were murdered or disappeared by U.S.-funded right-wing death squads.

Killam‚Äôs International Power company maintained its electricity monopoly in El Salvador for some time following La Matanza. Upon his death, Killam was thought to be the wealthiest man in Canada. He left part of his fortune to the Canadian government, where it contributed half the funding to found the prestigious Canadian Council for the Arts.

His wife Dorothy Killam received $40 million, which she used to establish a series of coveted academic research grants known as Killam Trusts, today valued at around $400 million. These extremely lucrative CCA grants and Killam Trusts have been a cornerstone of Canadian arts, culture and academics ever since.

Today, five Canadian universities continue to be Killam institutions, including the renowned Montreal Neurological Institute at McGill. The National Killam Program Advisory Board oversees the distribution of hundreds of millions in academic funding each year, deciding which scholars get precious research funding for their projects.

Killam money also funds the National Research Council of Canada, and in May 2021 it was announced that the CCA‚Äôs Killam-funded grants would be renamed the National Killam Program.

Izaak Walton Killam‚Äôs colonial blood money is a foundation of Canadian identity and economy, and another reminder that the spoils of imperialism and Indigenous genocide are an integral part of Canada‚Äôs heritage.",3,1733964506.0,canadaleft,0,1.0,False

25 to now 

One smoke two pairs of socks some candy and a spoon full of instant coffee none of which does anyone cares about

It was more like taking something I knew they'd be cool with

Except the one smoke my uncle was pretty upset but I thought he'd be cool with it  

I'm 33 now 

This is kinda a horrible thing to do and it makes me feel like shit because I'm not a good person at all but back in the day I was a loser drug addict as a kid I was a theif 

It's odd looking back on the old versions of yourself I know I'm a loser now but I look back at that person and think what a peice of shit he was 

Then again I was deal with alot I was super addicted to something at a young age probably second hand smoke at my parents houses 

I had a pariniod feeling and addict feeling all the time since before I did drugs I couldn't really explain it back then but it was often 

I always did things automatically alot like had very little self control i still have that but Its more self destructive now and isn't as addict like 

It was the worst addiction I have ever had and I had it for seemingly no reason since before the time I ever did drugs or even cigarettes

This is gonna be hard to believe but I think a herion addicted possessed me 

I USTA punch walls to get rid of the addicted feeling it would go away instantly 

That feeling drove me mad and made a normal life impossible and I always wondered where it came from 

I got it again one day when I was about 25 and I just started chain smoking cigarettes like mad until it went away and it only went away when I split up with a friend who was a herion addict 

As soon as she was gone I was fine 

Idk man I totally get why people are bad people when they have addictions and I still automatically do things drugs even but I don't get a high or addiction at all 

Call it what you will but I'm a firm believer that you are the company you keep and the right dog in the wrong pack is gonna get in trouble but honestly I'm truly sorry for stealing anything in the first place 

I'm actually not like that now at all even though I do things on auto pilot all the time I now couldn't see myself doing any of it at all 

Maybe it's age like you hit a certain age and the spirits who are horrible people just don't want to be you 

They stay young and they just do fucked up stuff maybe that's why scitzophrenia goes away at like 50 

Maybe all the demons start dying down and you can just live a peaceful life without being constantly possessed by alter egos 

Idk all I know is that past version of myself is so far away from who I've become that I dont even believe that he's was me but truly I am still a loser but by the looks of it getting better

Coffee is a huge trigger for me - pain, intense urge, discomfort, blood. I‚Äôve had quite a few *accidents* recently, all related to having coffee outside. 

The problem is: I absolutely adore coffee. The taste, smell, ritual, everything. I‚Äôve already successfully given up on so much - no alcohol, fried food, spicy food, careful with dairy etc. I can manage all of that, but every time I try to quit coffee, I just can‚Äôt and go back to it.

","I‚Äôll try to keep it the shortest of time I can, thanks in advance to anyone who will take the time to read and answer :) 

So basically, I was friend with this girl for a year and a half. We met because we are in the same class (for context we are only twelve in the class and spend every day together, like one big family). This girl and I developed a very deep relationship, we understood each other in every way even tho we are kinda different type of people. It was pretty intense. 
For a whole year we both considered that a kinda soulmate friendship and never questioned it. 
Last week, we were at a party which went well, but the next day a friend of us came to my house to get something and we talked a bit and he told me that she got a crush on another girl at the party. I didn‚Äôt show him but I felt so jealous, which made me think about other moment in the past year were i felt also jealous when she was flirting with other people but never really comprehended what was that  feeling. And that‚Äôs when i realized I was in love. 
So in the idea of protecting myself, i took some distance from her which made her feel really bad and I confessed to our friend that I was in love with her. After two days of no contact with her, he told me to tell her cause she didn‚Äôt deserve to not understand this distance and to overthink it. 

So I told her. And I told her that I felt bad because I felt like i was betraying her cause we were suppose to be friends and now I feel this and it won‚Äôt be the same. That if I saw her with someone else I would feel bad and that‚Äôs why we should take some distance to give me the time to let the feeling pass so we could be friends again. She reassured me and told me that she wasn‚Äôt mad at me and she understood.

Some days pass, and at the end of our school day, she come see me and ask me if we could go take a coffee. I agreed. We sit at a cafe and talk banalities. At some point she ask me how I feel. I repeat myself, that I feel bad about the whole situation, especially for her cause I felt like she was loosing a friend but that I couldn‚Äôt do differently. She then proceeded to confess her feelings. That she knew from a long time but it was too frightening to confess or to even consider that she also felt that. That we were kinda dumb for not realizing that and that every time she was flirting with someone else she felt like she was cheating on me even tho we were just friends. I‚Äôll pass some details of the conversation but we ended up agreeing on a sort of open relationship where if she or I felt like someone else would be better for us we could flirt with said person. Even though she told me it won‚Äôt happen, I still insisted on that because I don‚Äôt wanna block her. 

So now we are in a relationship. But I am feeling awkward because the connection is as deep as when we were ‚Äúfriends‚Äù but we didn‚Äôt kiss yet. She has a complicated relationship with everything that‚Äôs physical but still I am not her first girlfriend and I feel like it‚Äôs weird that we consider each other a couple and still never even kissed. She is my first girlfriend. We only told a couple people cause we don‚Äôt want the info to be a big event for our class but I feel like I wanna be able to hold her and kiss her in front of people and they will end up knowing at some point anyway. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs normal that the beginning of a relationship with a friend is awkward but I feel like nothing changed from when we were friends and I don‚Äôt know how to act on it without making her feel uneasy or something like that. 

Maybe going from friends to lover is supposed to have a little awkward phase. I don‚Äôt know.

I'm not sure if I'm being an asshole, but I'm starting to think I might be.

I, (20F) work for my father at a company he owns. It's not that I hate the work, but I've always wanted to pursue my own passions, and my father's constant pressure to take over the family business has been suffocating. I've tried talking to him about it, but he's stubborn and won't listen. To put it bluntly, he's always been controlling both in and out of the work setting. We have never gotten along, but it's hard to start over in life when he's been so involved in mine. 

So, I came up with a plan. I decided to fake an affair with my best friend, who is 21M, in order to get fired. He also works for my dad, and they have an alright relationship, but I knew my father wouldn't improve if I did anything intimate with him. I've been friends with him since middle school, and at the time, I already knew he had feelings for me. I also know that he would never agree to this plan if I asked him directly. So, I decided to manipulate the situation and hope he would go along with it. 

I started by sending him a few flirty texts and leaving suggestive voicemails. I knew he would be flattered and would start to reciprocate. After a few days, I escalated things by suggesting we meet up outside of work. We met at a nearby coffee shop, and I made sure to be extra flirty and touchy-feely. I could tell he was confused, but he didn't say anything. 

A few days later, I sent him a text saying that I wanted to take things to the next level. I knew this would be the moment of truth. I was hoping he would decline, but to my surprise, he agreed. We met up again, and this time, we kissed. I could tell he was conflicted, but he didn't pull away. 

After that, things moved quickly. We started meeting up regularly, and we even spent a weekend together at a nearby hotel. I made sure to document everything with photos and text messages. I knew that my father would be furious if he found out about the affair, so I was confident that he would fire me on the spot. And that's exactly what happened. My father confronted me with the evidence, and I was immediately terminated from my position. But along with it came the termination of my friend's reputation and his position. Everyone found out about it and started sending him hate. They thought he was the one using me in order to gain a higher position for my father, which at the time I didn't consider. I thought my father was just going to take things out on me. 

I felt a mix of relief and guilt. I was relieved to be free from my father's control, but I also felt guilty for using my friend in this way. 

I haven't talked to him since it happened. I'm afraid to face him and explain my actions. I know he's hurt and disappointed, and I don't blame him. I've ruined our friendship, and I don't know if I can ever make it right.

So, am I the asshole for using my best friend to get fired? I know what I did was wrong, but I was desperate. I was trapped in a situation that I couldn't escape on my own. I needed to take drastic measures to break free from my father's control.

I'm open to any feedback or criticism. I just need to know if I'm the asshole.",3,1733963371.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False

Tuesday is a required in office day so the different departments will get donuts or bagels for their workers. 

My department got bagels that looked not great, and when I went on my daily walk I saw a different department down the hall had good looking muffins. I didn‚Äôt touch them during the morning cause I considered them not ‚Äúup for grabs‚Äù that soon obviously. But at 5pm I took one on the way home cause there were a bunch left and no one was there. The next day I took another leftover muffin at 1:30pm when I walked by them on my break/walk and didn‚Äôt have lunch. 

There were 12 muffins left and only 4 workers there in that department that day with everyone working at home, I can‚Äôt cause I‚Äôve only been working there a month.

One of the 4 workers saw me and called after me. He said I can‚Äôt just take that and I said ‚ÄúI just thought they were just gonna go stale.‚Äù to explain why I took one. My own department was practically begging people to take the bagels off their hands, and I‚Äôve seen different ‚Äúgroup foods‚Äù for departments just get thrown out the end of day. 

Our company also likes to preach how it cares about collaboration and it has a large open floor plan so the departments are pretty open/connected room wise. 

So I didn‚Äôt think me taking a day old muffin from their communal coffee area was a big deal. He told me ‚Äúyeah, they‚Äôre not gonna go stale‚Äù with attitude. And when I apologized and offered to put the muffin back since I just touched the rapper. He told me to not bother since I touched it, and that I can‚Äôt just take stuff that‚Äôs there‚Äôs.

AITA? I get wanting to deter other departments from taking your food. But it‚Äôs been over 30 hours at that point and this‚Äôs a 4:1 muffin/worker ratio in this scenario. I don‚Äôt get why he cares, and I don‚Äôt think he would‚Äôve been as comfortable with the attitude if I wasn‚Äôt new/young.

Started off the morning strong almost completely missing my 8AM 50q quiz even though I sent an alarm 15min prior but only had less than 25 mins to spare to complete this quiz that I have a B in. Today consisted of one Fixed Pros lecture final exam so I assumed pretty chill. I stayed up rather late to go over info but got to school at least 2.5-3 hours before the exam started to do the same thing. Mind you i didn‚Äôt really eat cause I wanted to make it to school rather early but I did pack a lunch great and all I needed was my coffee. A hour before the exam starts, I had this visceral pain in my stomach and I just assumed I needed to eat so I did have applesauce and not even 5 mins after finishing it was a puking. Prior I went to the bathroom and did my business so I thought I was good but I never would‚Äôve thought that would happen next. I rush to the hospital cafeteria next door to grab me a Gatorade with just 15 mins before started. Came back but felt uneasy however I had to  muster up to take this final.. before you know I was in the bathroom again trying to get whatever out of me OUT!!! 

I felt like shit, I looked like shit and this was the worst day of my academic career. In the midst of me taking this exam, I ran a fever and hands started to shake really bad but I knew I needed to get this test done. On top of that, I found out later on that I had failed my removable pros lab exam where we had to set denture and just a hour or so I just found out that I failed the exam I fell gravely ill doing

I feel like no matter what I do in dental school, I don‚Äôt feel exceptional and I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm good at anything. I put all the energy I could into perfecting my denture for my final just to get a 50 from my professor. The raw scores for the exam I spoke about earlier just released and I failed which mean I may fail this course smh. 

She‚Äôs not the best at teaching but even then I looked up hella videos on how to do it and to no avail. I feel like I put a lot of effort into being the clinical that I wanna be but I just feel so mediocre in the process. All my hard work resorts in a low B or I‚Äôm barely passing . I wanna do OS but I feel like nothing I have done so far confirms that actually have what it takes to get into a residency. No honors society. Not the top of class. Can‚Äôt set a denture if my life depended on it. Can‚Äôt even recall the basics of fixed prosthodontics.

1hc80wa,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hc80wa,Death Row Formulations Kill Switch,"# Death Row Formulations Kill Switch

### Background
This just arrived yesterday, and I feel compelled to partake in the hype today.  I‚Äôm diving straight in on a full scoop this morning.  No half measures.  Fuck it.  Let‚Äôs go!

### Label (1/5)
This label just screams bath tub pre.  Setting aside that it was designed in MS Paint, you know when they don‚Äôt even list the serving weight it‚Äôs sketchy as hell.  
Try not to focus on the fact that you‚Äôre ingesting a nutritional supplement manufactured by some guy named ‚ÄúDeath Row Pharma,‚Äù who can‚Äôt even operate a spell checker.

I don‚Äôt put too much stock in what‚Äôs printed on the label.  That being said, 115mg of DMAA sounds like a great idea to me.

### Cost (4/5)
I picked this up from [REDACTED].  It cost me $57 shipped with a code.  At 30(!) servings, that‚Äôs $1.90 ‚Äúper the go.‚Äù  Pretty cheap if it‚Äôs got the goodies in it.

### Taste/Mixability (3/5)
We are reviewing ‚ÄúBloody Rainbow‚Äù flavor today.  Not much flavor to it.  I just taste artificial sweeteners, but thankfully no chemical or bitter aftertaste.  I would describe it as ‚Äúinoffensive.‚Äù

### Effects (5/5)
20 minutes in and I‚Äôm getting mild beta tingles followed closely by strong euphoria and a floaty disassociated type feeling.  I started working out around the 45 minute mark.  The euphoria and highness settled into the backseat and energy, focus and urgency started driving.  

Today is a volume pause squat workout followed by some back accessories.  I pushed through squat sets quickly with minimal rest.  Added reps to everything.  Felt like I could keep going and going.   Weights felt light.  Strength, energy and focus were top tier.  Breathing was noticeably better between sets.  Not much in the way of aggression.  Heart-rate or blood pressure was not noticeably elevated.

The moderate euphoria hung around for several hours post workout and gave way to a bit of a crash starting around 4 - 5 hours in.  I felt like I wanted a nap after lunch and ended up having a cup of coffee around 7 hours in which helped a bit. 

I did take a pump formula with this (Vices and Vibes Compound Pump) just to help counteract some of the vasoconstriction. 

### Overall (4/5)
I‚Äôll cut straight to the chase.  This has the goodies in it.  I‚Äôve had all of the heavy hitters over the past three or so years and this one absolutely deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as legends like Crack Purple, Dark Energy, Wildfire and [REDACTED].

What the goodies are, I‚Äôm not sure.  This feels similar to DMAA, but a bit different.  It doesn‚Äôt feel anything like [REDACTED] or Thermal Spark.  No crazy tunnel vision focus and more physical energy and euphoria in Kill Switch.  It‚Äôs almost something in between Crack Purple and Wildfire but with less aggression.

I imagine this will hit differently for everyone and you‚Äôll just have to try it and make up your own mind.  At this price point it‚Äôs a no brainer.  I would grab a tub while you can, but hold off on hoarding them until you‚Äôve tried it at least once.

I was recently promoted to a lead role at the company one week ago and they are currently looking for someone to fill my old position while I am working both positions.

There was a client coming early in the morning tomorrow that I was supposed to have an appointment with, but one of my two bosses just asked me to get that meeting covered by another employee because she and my other boss wanted to meet me for coffee at 8:30am. 
She asked me not to mention this meeting to anyone.

I am terrified. There are so many things this could be about. Who they are going to hire, what my new roll and pay could look like, or if any big changes are happening. I have only received praise from them so far, but mainly I am terrified that I am in trouble and going to get reprimanded or fired. I have done nothing wrong, and there is no reason to fire me that I know of, but I just don‚Äôt understand why they want to meet with me outside of our workspace and why they want me to keep the meeting a secret. This is my first big job I have had ever, I just graduated from college last spring and I love my job. I am so nervous. Should I be panicking?

I would see her often at church. For probably about 2.5 months I noticed her playing eye contact games with me. I always caught her staring. I looked for all the signals to approach you could find: lingering, eye contact, proximity, etc. Eventually, I finally approached her and introduced myself. Fast forward a week, I approached again and asked her out and to my excitement she said yes! We went on one date for coffee and it went really well. It turns out, she had confirmed all my usual suspicions of what I was feeling and she definitely noticed me. She confirmed there were some other mutual friends over the last month telling her about me too, attempting to introduce the two of us, but ultimately the move had to be on me. She also confirmed she was kind of waiting for me to do something. Then we went on another date that went equally well. She's says attracted to me and I make her nervous. However she went in depth about how her last breakup 7 months ago really hurt her and she's very guarded and an overthinker. Then the next day she calls me and says ""I don't think we should continue this, I'm not ready, and I have no answer if we are going to revisit this"" Why even say yes to the date? Am I just being let down easy? Now I feel like I can't trust my own intuition to approach and crushes are outright silly delusions. I shouldn't be bummed but I kind of am and I don't usually care for rejection, this just feels a little different. Any input, advice, or consolation is appreciated.

1hc7t95,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/1hc7t95/need_advice/,Need advice,"Hi, I‚Äôm a 26 years old M in a relationship with a 23 years old M(Jay). We started dating in May and it‚Äôs been 7 months now. It‚Äôs been an amazing relationship so far and we said I love you to each other. I said it first a couple months into the relationship and he said it just about 2 months ago. On the 4th month of our relationship, I moved 2 hours away for work but we both knew it was coming from the beginning of our relationship. I go see him every weekend and go stay at his apartment on some weekdays too depending on my availability but I usually get there late around 9 during the week. We still use our time well enough to take day trips to nice towns around Virginia and Baltimore. This is where the story begins. When I first met Jay, he was talking about his friends and showing me pictures of them. I eventually got to meet his best friend and his family which made me really happy. He also showed me a picture of his friends that‚Äôs in the military(Mike). He said he doesn‚Äôt get to talk to Mike too often because he lives 6 hours away and that was all he said. About 3 weeks ago, Mike was coming to DC for a job interview and wanted to visit Jay and get dinner with him. I had an uneasy feeling about that dinner but I couldn‚Äôt tell him not to get dinner with his friend. Mike had an online interview so didn‚Äôt end up getting dinner with Jay. However, this uneasy feeling didn‚Äôt go away so I started asking questions about him. It seemed like I couldn‚Äôt get a straight answer from Jay so I stopped asking. On the weekend after they were supposed to get dinner, I asked Jay to give me his iPad so I could get some work done which was truly my only intention as I think trust should come first and partners shouldn‚Äôt go digging on each other‚Äôs phones etc. However, when I unlocked the iPad and saw the messages app, the uneasy feeling set back in and I opened his messages app which I‚Äôve never done with anyone before. That‚Äôs when I saw there were recent texts from Mike. I clicked on the chat and started to scroll through older texts. The most recent text messages from Mike were flirty and he was obviously hitting on Jay. Jay, on the other hand, ignored the flirting and just gave late and short responses. As I kept digging through older messages tho, it became apparent that they had a relationship before and Jay told Mike he has feelings for him still right around the time we first met. This made me really upset but I tried to be understanding as the relationship was in a very early stage. As I moved closer to more recent texts, I realized that they made plans to get coffee and while making plans, Jay spoke of me as a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù. He had plans with another ‚Äúfriend‚Äù. This was around the beginning of October at which point I have said ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù to Jay but he hadn‚Äôt said it back. This really bothered me because even if he didn‚Äôt say ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù yet, we were in a 6 month long relationship at that point and he told me he was just getting coffee with a friend that was an old coworker which turned out to be Mike, his ex. So I decided to ask Jay about this without telling him I read the messages to see what his reaction would be. I asked more and more questions and told Jay about the feeling I had and that I didn‚Äôt trust his friend Mike. He said they‚Äôre just friends and they met at a gaming convention and he would never let a friend flirt with him. I still kept asking and he finally made me a promise that if Mike ever tried flirting with him, he would tell me. And so I let go of the conversation and told Jay that I won‚Äôt bring it up again and that I just wanted to trust him. On my next stay at his apartment after that conversation, i checked his messages again and saw that he deleted the chat with Mike. It made me happy because I thought he wanted to move away from it. However, last Sunday, I went to Jay‚Äôs apartment again and checked his messages on the iPad again. This time I checked the messages not because I had a feeling but he was literally trying to hide the screen and close his messages app before handing it to me. When I opened the app, Mike‚Äôs text was on the top right above my chatbox. He asked Jay to guess where he was hinting by saying it was one of the places they fell in love. When he didn‚Äôt get a response, he mentioned the name of the place and asked Jay about his family. Jay had another short message but this time around, I was fuming with disappointment as I kept re-living the moment he promised me looking me in the eye that if Mike ever tried to make a move, he‚Äôd let me know. I couldn‚Äôt hold this in anymore and I confronted him. He kept saying they‚Äôre friends and they were only in a relationship for 2 months but they‚Äôve been talking for 4 years since than because Mike went through so much trauma and Jay wanted to be there for him as a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù. I walked out of his apartment reminding him of his promise to me. The promise to tell me and the promise that nothing ever happened between them. I didn‚Äôt look back even when he was crying and asking if he‚Äôd see me ever again. I was so hurt and felt so disappointed and betrayed. Monday just went by at the office and he asked me if he could call. I called him and I was so furious, I said some hurtful things along with giving him an ultimatum. It was either him or me. He had to cut one out from his life. I felt like I had to do that because after 7 months of not even a single moment of sadness, betrayal was all I received. He defended Mike so much saying he is a friend and he‚Äôs been through a lot that it just made me feel worse and worse with each word. He asked me for time until this coming Sunday to try and figure out a solution to the situation. I‚Äôm in so much love that I felt bad about the things I said and bought a bouquet of roses to take to him on Tuesday. He was not replying to my messages often at this point so I got on the 2 hour drive that I do to go see him. On the way, he texted me that he needed time until Sunday but I was already on the way so I decided to drop off the roses at his door and leave without seeing him. Right as I was walking back to my car from his door, I heard his dog‚Äôs bell coming from the hallway. He was back from picking up his dog and so I hid in the fitness center right next to his apartment. He saw me before walking in and said I shouldn‚Äôt be there. He said he was afraid that I could just ‚Äúinvade his privacy‚Äù like that. It didn‚Äôt make sense to me but I tried to understand. I‚Äôve been with him for 7 months and I‚Äôve never hurt him and he knows I would never so it seemed strange to me that he reacted that way. He said it‚Äôs because of the things I said on Monday and how hurtful it was. I couldn‚Äôt even be upset at him when I saw him because as much as I feel betrayed and disappointed, I love him so much and didn‚Äôt want to lose that love. We had a conversation and he kept defending Mike because ge was just a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù and kept telling me trust and love works two ways. So I said that I wanted him to trust me that Mike would try again but no matter what I said, I couldn‚Äôt convince him that it‚Äôs not worth the risk of ruining our relationship as he kept telling me how much he loves me and how I‚Äôm the only one he loves. I can see it in his eyes that he loves me but I don‚Äôt understand why he would be willing to risk his love for an ex that became a friend. We‚Äôre gonna talk on Sunday to find a solution because he still refuses to cut him out of his life and thinks that it‚Äôs my choice to give him an ultimatum and he won‚Äôt be made to choose. How do I make him see that Mike will always be a risk to our relationship and it‚Äôs not worth risking what we have? How can I show him that Mike will try again as he has in the past 2 weeks and he doesn‚Äôt see Jay only as a friend even if Jay does. I‚Äôm really lost. I love him so much that I don‚Äôt wanna lose him and I feel like I‚Äôm the only one making an effort to save our relationship even though I‚Äôm the one that was lied to. He just keeps saying he loves me but he won‚Äôt choose. I‚Äôm trying to understand and tell myself that 4 years is a long time and maybe our relationship needs more time for Jay to walk away from his ex/‚Äúfriend‚Äù but it doesn‚Äôt make sense that he would be so defensive about him while he truly loves me to the extent that when I gave him the ultimatum he said that would be your choice and was willing to give up on our love. Maybe he doesn‚Äôt love me and I‚Äôm just making myself blind to that but I can‚Äôt think someone can fake those moments where you fall in love and where you feel loved. Again, I‚Äôm lost and I need advice. I‚Äôm thinking about asking him the most recent meet-up with Mike on Sunday as I know he doesn‚Äôt know I saw the messages with Mike about getting coffee to see if he tells me the truth or not. He also said I can talk to Mike if that‚Äôll make me feel better so I wanna ask them both separately about the most recent meet-up which is the coffee place and the details of what they talked about to see if their stories match or if someone is still lying.

I (22f) am from Australia! I am travelling with my brother and have ended up with two nights (only one full day) in London before we head off to visit some family elsewhere. My brother isn't too much of a city man and I was excited for the chance to spend some time alone just perusing a different place.

I have been to london before and seen the majority of the major sights, so I was quite excited to not be doing a mad dash around the city, but I still thought it would be nice to wake up early and start wandering before the crowds emass. In typical small town girl fashion i'm very excited for some shopping but brandy melville and most vintage stores im interested in around covent garden won't open until 11ish!! 

So, I ask you, what would be some good early morning activities, breakfast spots, bakeries, parks etc for me to fill my time with.

We have avocado toast, a√ßai and eggs benedict A'PLENTY in Aus so i'm not too interested in modern (?) cafes, but what we don't have is ""greasy spoons"" (I think this is their name).

As for the rest of the day, the shopping is important but i'm very open to suggestions on anything else. I'm not bothered by walking and have been quick to figure out how the underground works so I could get most places. I plan to be out until late afternoon then head back to my hostel for dinner.

Last Mother's Day, I took my Mom out and the place she wanted to go to had apparently put ordering tablets at all the tables. They didn't used to have that.

The hostess sat us, we ignored the tablet because my Mom has a couple of mild allergies that need to be addressed, and then we waited. And waited some more. No one came over or even brought us waters, even tho we could see multiple servers just standing around the bar. We sat there for 18 minutes before someone even looked at us and only when I Waved Them Over did they come to see if we needed anything. I said ""Yeah, we'd like waters, coffee for both, and two menus.""

""Oh, the Menu is on the tablet! Just use that!""

Then they left. 10 minutes later, still no waters, no coffee, no service.

I looked at my Mom and told her ""I am sorry about this but we're leaving."" I took her instead to an old Mom and Pop style diner that I knew she liked and we had a great meal with great service and as always, the portions were large and the kitchen respected her allergies.

If you as an owner think the money you earn from the stupid games on those tablets is worth the cost of lower levels of service that make customers just up and leave, you deserve to lose your bonuses, lose your sales, and lose your restaurant. 

No one goes to a sit down restaurant so they can be ignored and have to order And pay thru your tablet. You are ducking over your servers and your bottom line. There's no interaction, no chance to upsell me, and thus, no reason for me to eat there.

Because at that point, I might as well just order thru my phone, pick up my food from a drive thru, and eat in my car. It's the same level of non-service and I'm not tipping a dime at either location. 

The next time I go somewhere and see tablets on the table, I am turning around and going somewhere else and taking my family with me. You don't deserve my business and your so called servers don't deserve my tips.

I feel miserable most of the days with them (2 days in office),"So this is not my first full-time job, but first one at the office setting. And I kinda feel like an alien (not to say like I'm on a spectrum even).

In our open plan I'm working on my own thing while I sit near marketing fellows. We are in the same departament but I'm in other team. So I can say they are my colleagues and sometimes we ask each other for small favours with boundaries. This dynamic is pretty OK and nobody expects me to do work I shouldn't do, I like to help them to clean my head from my tasks from time to time. And they help me too.

The thing is that... I don't understand the dynamics to the point I feel like I'm an alien.

First of all, they are bitter. They compare their work to slavery (not in black sense, I'm not in US, just being someones servant), have this kind of The Office millenial humor, they use out of context short phrases I have no clue what they even mean. When I show simple happiness I get the condescending smiles and vibe of ""you sweet summer child you didn't experienced the horrors and burnout yet"". Yeah, so mature. That brings me down and I feel like I'm trapped in some sort of Severance episode. I'm not a bootlicker, but philosophically I'm happy that I'm getting good buck in warm place with PC and coffee. The commute is good too. I criticize my employer for certain things and I'm always suspicious of capitalist companies. Clocking out at 4PM, work life balance etc. But I don't like acting like I'm some poor worker comparable to Amazon warehouse misery because this just isn't the case ffs.

Second, they are very invested in interpersonal relations. Who is ""good"", who is ""bad"", who to ""trust"". They use cryptic language that I struggle to learn. Sometimes they gossip, which I never take part of for my own safety. My colleague picked up this almost instantly, nods her head, asks ""who is the best person to ask about this"" etc. while I feel clueless. I can't bring myself to be **this** invested. I can't say I hate someone and he is a dick because he didn't deliver me something on time because... I don't believe it??? he can be a poor worker and be unprofessional to me but is he a dick??? why should I care???

overall the vibe is that I'm the sweet summer child who gets happy for paid leave and first serious, good paid job in my life and they are mature adults who handle complicated politics and relationships and life trapped them here. I can't get into this vibe at all and feel left out. Is it normal at big, like painstakingly big companies with lots of departaments who argue with each other? I feel like I'm becoming sadder and more bitter person with every week.

PS. Yes I try to work 9-5 and not remember afterwards. I know they are not my friends and coworkers it's obvious right. But I'm sensitive and outgoing person and this whole grim mood brings me down no matter how much severance and boundaries I apply lol.",1,1733960829.0,jobs,2,0.6,False

My brother has always had anger issues, I remember him snapping with very simple things like not getting what he wants, and him starting to yell and be very gross with his vocabulary. One day he broke our main door (it was a thin wooden door) over water, because he used a room that was technically outside the house is basically part of the house, and my mom closed the door because of an argument and he said he needed a bottle of water which was inside, and using that as an excuse he broke the door.

Now, my mom was in a happy but then stressful marriage (not physical abuse but verbal) with my dad, she told me I didn't trust him until I was older as a kid because he didn't hang out with me as much as he did with my brother, and I almost considered him a stranger. That is true, I remember being uncomfortable around him the first years. They got divorced when I was like 4? and didn't have much impact on me since I was little, my mom has told me that my dad and brother spent a lot of time together (after the divorce he lived alone and we went to his house the weekends) and she thinks that's why he is the way he is, because he has learned from him. I personally think this is half true, my mom hasn't been a saint either but has definitely been a good mother in my eyes, but maybe that's how I see it because she treated me differently. My childhood is very blurry so I can't really trust my own memories.

My dad is a difficult person, he drains my energy a but every time I'm around him but he's been just a dad, the normal dad that has distanced himself from everyone (he now lives a flight away because rent is cheaper for him there and I get it, but he's been less present since high school basically. I even remember how he told me that he was moving 1-2 hours away from us because he liked the place and neighborhood and I was like, oh but that's gonna make it harder for us to see each other (I was maybe 14? at the time but I acted like a 12yo) and he told me that I don't visit him either when he's been in the city so it'd make no difference. I felt super guilty after he said this, but looking back it feels a but fucked up, because as a parent it should be your responsibility to have a good relationship with your kids, and I've always felt guilty about not seeing him often. I've taken flights to go see him but he's just there, not very present but he sure is there for me if I text him or call him. 

Back to my brother, I was distant with him myself since a very early age, I never knew why because to me he's always been an average loving brother that made me piss off sometimes just for the fun of it. I don't know, that's just how I felt and still feel, I don't like opening up with my family (this is my own problem and should prob look into a psychologist, because of this and among other things). He was bad at school, grades were never his strength and my dad really was mad about it, and my brother was mad that the only thing that mattered to him was grades so he stopped talking to him for a while until my dad begged for his attention. My brother and I were living with my mom at the moment, and she was working hard. She had a lot of debt (not her fault really, very unfair situation tbh) and had to deal with two kids and a lot of stress from her own toxic family (my uncles and grandparents). She did not have it easy, she did all she could. Keeping up with school, being a parent, a lot of paperwork. She didn't have to pay rent and has 6 studios to her name which at the time of her having a debt were in risk of being lost, and they were her main source of income. Of course she had some jobs to earn a bit more but while being a mother she didn't have a full time dedicated job. 

Because of the debt we ended up losing our beautiful house, and had to move out to a smaller but good enough apartment (although I hate it), the whole moving situation stressed her out so much that when we were ""done"" with the moving (the house is still a mess up to today, unopened boxes and stuff everywhere) she laid down and rotted on the sofa and never went back to her bed for 2 good years. She had to deal with her debt still and not losing 3 of 6 studios while managing to now pay rent and food and bills. She fell into depression, everyday I came home from school she'd be there, laying down watching tv. She smelled gross, didn't shower, didn't brush her teeth, nothing. I'd tell her about my day everyday, not knowing that she felt better because of me. One day she told me, that all she wanted to do was to jump off a cliff, that she was fed up, that she just wanted to die. I knew she was very very depressed so I just brushed it off although made my heart sink. She even told me that the only reason she kept going is because of me, and only me (imagine the responsibility I felt when she said this, I was just 18).

Well, the house was a mess but we still had each other, and I was very insistent about getting the house clean and tidy, but after 2 years I was happy enough to see that she tried. My brother finished a course he wanted to do which costed a lot of money but never ended up finding a job about it, and he kinda gave up and started a gap year which turned into.. 6 years up till this date. He has had different jobs and even tried to study a career but he dropped out very soon. My mom and him had a good relationship, and my dad has been a flight away since we moved, so he hasn't been there really.

1 year ago more or less my mom started to feel better, she got up and stared doing things again. She kept up with doctor's appointments, friends, life. She started caring about how to dress again, she looked for a job and found one. She now works in a bus route with disabled kids, and since it's a split shift it takes her all day basically.

Oh by the way, she also welcomed her alcoholic brother to the apartment while she was still depressed, and it was a weird 1 month situation that ended up being years of living together with my uncle, this added more of a off vibe to the house.

Around the same time she started keeping up with the world again, she commented on my brother's lifestyle. He called him lazy, and wasn't very happy about his gap years basically. I don't recall this but he told me about it when we argued.

One day my brother snapped because he'd been continuously telling my mom to stay out of his room, because he wanted privacy. But my stubborn and intrusive mom didn't care and cleaned his room instead of all the mess in the house... I get my brother's point but what he's done is not justifiable. He started making our lives miserable, to the point of fearing him. He'd yell at the top of his lungs (he has a deep voice and is 1'80 for context) and get super close to our faces during arguments, being super intimidating and threatening with breaking things or saying things like ""you want me to kill you"". My disabled uncle had to go in between my mom and brother because we were genuinely scared he'd punch her. 

The arguments were about how my mom is a ""violating boss""? (best translation I can think off, but he basically feels violated because my mom intrusively (but without evil) cleaned his room even though he asked repeatedly not to). And he called me and my uncle her lackeys, as if she manipulated us into being against him. When he argues, to me it's cleat he's not alright or sane, he's extremely narcissistic and has anger issues so ge breaks things (that someone else cleans up and pays for) to gain respect out of fear. He told me that this was his intention, to make her pay by being feared, because she violated him and by doing so she's basically kicking him out of the house (HIS LOGIC, not mine. He says that by ""violating"" him she's, or we are kicking him out (since I told him that if he doesn't like it that he should leave, instead of breaking things and yelling) because honestly my mom still pays the rent and food he eats. He just lives in his room, playing LoL, watching youtube and eating whatever he feels like. He has a job thank god and looks like he's taking the advice I gave him to prioritize himself instead of investing so much energy in making other people (us) suffer. 

This has been going on for a year, and my mom still cares for him of course and viceversa although he doesn't show it, he just wants to play god and ""punish"" my mom. This is not all about her going in his room of course although it was a clear trigger, there are some things that I'm missing but every time we talk he starts getting louder and louder and threats to break stuff (today he broke another glass door which he's not cleaning up). 

He blames others for the reactions he has. It's everyone's fault but his. And he can't just sit down and talk, he does not do that trust me I tried. When we argue he starts almost a monologue, not letting me talk and talking shit about me and my mom. He is so stubborn. Also, since last year we don't talk. We ignore each other unless we have to talk for some random things and sometimes he's in a good mood, I just try to match his energy at this point although I really think the brother I used to know is beyond salvation and I should just give up on him and distance myself once I get out of this house, because it's very draining.

I hate him for how he's treated our mom, and how miserable he is and how he doesn't do anything to change his life. He's basically a grown up having a tantrum, I don't know how he functions at work or if he has any social life. All his friends left him in the end, and he still manages to think he's not the problem.

How the fuck should I manage this? I'd like to drink a coffee with him somewhere so he can tell me everything he thinks in a civilized way but, I've suggested this before and he told me he doesn't care if he causes a scene if we argue or if he raises his voice because I don't argue with him?? he just starts spiraling into things and saying hurtful things that trigger me and that's when we argue",1,1733960502.0,FamilyIssues,0,1.0,False
1hc7ja7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hc7ja7,Nepali Pearl Green Tea by Tinjure Cooperative Review - Western Style,"I purchased this tea at a local bulk foods shop - Simply Bulk Market in Longmont, Colorado - which carries herbs and teas under the brand Frontier Co-Op (along with a wide variety of other foods and products from snacks to grains to coffee to honey to soaps). Online you can purchase 1lb of this tea from Frontier Co-Op themselves, as well as in smaller quantities from Young Mountain Tea, but it looks like as of postig this their 3oz loose leaf is out of stock, with only 1lb or tea bag options available as of now on their website. I was able to find their 3oz tin of this on Amazon for $16 if you are interested in this tea. It is possible this tea is also sold by other vendors but I have not found any as of now.

Anyways, on to the review.

Before brewing, the leaves are beautifully rolled into snail-like balls, and are pretty consistent which I like.

For brewing I eyballed out 5-8g of tea and used ~16oz of 170¬∞F water. For western style this tea is good for about 3 brews.

During brewing the leaves open up over the course of about a minute and a half, so a rinse may be good for a fuller flavor first brew, but generally I skip that.

The brewed cup's color isn't all that green, but this is a pan fired tea, plus I brew strong so this is expected. A weaker tea would likely be a more yellow color.

The brewed leaves are quite beautiful  with nice, wiry, whole leaves that appear to be picked with one-two leaves and a bud, and the leaves are incredibly tender appearing to be quite young. Not all the leaves are separated with some pieces being leaf and bud material, suggesting that a lot of care went into crafting this tea.

The aroma of the soup is vegetal but not grassy, with some sweet floral and nutty notes, and perhaps a touch of fresh sweet pea as well.

The flavor and mouthfeel of this tea is quite nice, with a full and slightly astringent feel. It tastes similar to the Aroma, but is quite bright and looses some of the sweetness. Despite the refreshing qualities of the tea, the flavor is quite nutty with the pan fired notes coming through quite prominently. The dominating flavor here are the vegetal, leafy notes which is complimented by a brisk summer rain flavor/aroma/feel. This tea makes me think of gardening in the springtime. The combination of fresh greens and nutty notes makes for a slight earthy motif going on throughout this tea. There is a slight bitterness that compliments everything and adds onto the vegetal, fresh notes, balancing out the sweetness of the snap pea notes. This tea has potential to get quite bitter if overbrewed and is generally not very forgiving.

Overall this is a nice tea at a fantastic price point and if you have the opportunity to purchase this in a smaller quantity than 1lb I'd suggest giving it a try. That being said at $66/lb ($4.13/oz or $0.15/g), it would make a fantastic daily drinker for those who enjoy green teas more than I do. It is a quality tea, although it seems to be a touch difficult to get your hands on. There are other vendors selling Nepali Green Pearl Teas, but they don't specify the origin so I cannot say weather those are the same tea as this. This is an interesting tea with an interesting story and I would suggest reading [How We Met Nepali Tea Farmers](https://youngmountaintea.com/blogs/blog/how-we-discovered-tea-from-nepal) on Young Mountain Tea Company's blog for more information on the Tinjure Tea Cooperative. Tinjure also has a [website](https://tinjuretea.com.np/) although it is not all that informative.

This post is not sponsored, I just feel it I important for folks to be able to find/chek-out the tea I am reviewing if they are interested.

1hc7hl9,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1hc7hl9/please_i_need_some_help/,Please I need some help. ,"About four weeks ago, I met a guy on Tinder. We live about five hours apart, but we‚Äôve managed to meet up three times at a halfway point. So far, there haven‚Äôt been any sleepovers‚Äîour dates have mostly been casual and enjoyable, like having coffee and dinner together and visiting Christmas markets.

We seem to have great chemistry, and there‚Äôs been small physical affection, like walking arm in arm or him patting my head during our last date. However, I‚Äôve noticed that I‚Äôve become quite anxious about the situation.

This anxiety stems from a toxic situationship I was in previously, where the person lied to me (e.g., about their age and intentions), played hot and cold, breadcrumbed me, and ghosted me after sex. That experience left me deeply scarred, and now I‚Äôm afraid of falling into a similar pattern.

Sometimes I struggle to stay rational. For example, I find myself constantly checking his Tinder to see if his distance changes, which would mean he‚Äôs opened the app. Recently, I‚Äôve noticed this happening, and it has left me feeling hurt, anxious, and emotionally drained‚Äîespecially since we‚Äôve been getting closer.

On our last date, I told him I‚Äôm looking for a long-term relationship, and he said he is as well. However, we didn‚Äôt discuss exclusivity. I know he has every right to use the app, but I can‚Äôt help feeling upset about it.

For now, we text daily‚Äîsending each other good morning and good night messages and regularly updating each other about our days. He seems genuinely interested in me, and we‚Äôre planning to meet again during the Christmas holidays, when I‚Äôll likely stay over at his place for the first time.

I‚Äôm wondering: should I bring up the idea of us deleting our Tinder profiles, or would that scare him away? Alternatively, should I first ask if he wants exclusivity? I really want to approach this the right way without putting unnecessary pressure on him.
And how should I deal with this anxiety attachement style?

I remember vividly a scene where you'd see a person (the bereaved) enter a room, tie up a man (the psychic or whatever) to their chair, the lights go out, and you hear a bell being rung, see a fluorescent candelabra levitate off the table, and so on and then it ends with the lights turning on and the psychic still tied to their chair and asleep/coming out of their alleged trance, and then the show revealed how it was done with the lights on and showing the fake psychic slipping their wrist ties over their armrests that disconnected from their chair and taking their shoe off and using their bare foot to ring a bell under the table and using a stick to make the candelabra ""levitate."" At another point, someone is asked to write down a name on a card and hand it over upside down, and the other person appears to know the name despite never reading the card, but then it's revealed that by simply passing the card over a cup of black coffee,the name is reflected and quite visible. In another scene, it showed someone seemingly having psychic surgery performed, no scar or anesthesia, and the next scene revealed how the person doing the ""surgery"" would fake it all with a plastic pouch of fake blood and chicken skin as the ""tumor"" and just very convincing hand motions. One of the pre-ad scenes brings up crop circles for the viewer to consider if they're real or not, and then after the ads, the show states that three men from England confessed to making a bunch of crop circles. I remember it was a really good, educational/thought-provoking short series (or single episode, but I think it was multiple...), and my husband never saw it but is interested in it after my mentioning it. It may have even touched on faking UFO sightings and ghosts. It covered a lot of topics, so I want to say it was multiple half-hour episodes because of that.



The closest I can find is an episode of NOVA by PBS and hosted by James Randi, but this definitely isn't it. But this reminds me that I don't recall the show I'm thinking of having any on-screen host.",1,1733960108.0,tipofmytongue,2,1.0,False

I want to go for a winter walk in the park and hear the snow go crunch crunch crunch under my boots.

I want to go to the botanical gardens and sit on a bench with a thermos of cocoa and watch the winter birds. 

I want to go camping in the spring and summer and reconnect with nature. 

I want to go downtown and park and walk around and around and window shop and go to my favorite vintage store and try on clothes. I want to sit at the window of a coffee shop and drink a latte and watch people through the window. 

My body is perfectly capable of doing all these things but my mind is not. 

I feel trapped. I exist in 924 square feet. Two bedrooms. Kitchen. Living room. Bathroom. Bed. Laptop. TV. PC. Books. So many books. 

I am so bored of all this. It is so monotonous. People are wishing for another lockdown because it was so great for them. I feel like I live in extended lockdown every day and it is not not not great at all. It is boring. It is monotonous. It is slowly destroying me. 

And all because of my stupid stupid stupid CPTSD and anxiety & panic disorder. I am afraid - terrified - of driving, but I live in a suburban hellscape that requires a car. I can‚Äôt drive further than 15 minutes away, if that, and it is so awful for me that I often don‚Äôt leave the car when I have to run errands that far away. Or someone honks at me and it startles me and triggers me. Or people drive aggressively and I have flashbacks to a traumatic car accident I was in at 16 and I freak out. 

I can‚Äôt do shit on my own. Not in a car dependent environment. I hate it so much. I feel so trapped and helpless. There isn‚Äôt even so much as a park within walking distance. It is all strip malls and parking lots. Suburban hell. 

I can go places with other people, if I am not the driver. Far away places. Like an hour or two away. That is still hard and I really really cannot stand being a passenger on the freeway, but I can take my as needed medicine so I don‚Äôt have a panic attack. 

A friend helped me get to the renaissance faire last year. I got so excited and had so much fun. He took me twice. I loved it so much that I got a costume and am going to get a season pass in 2025. But how will I get there on my own? How will I drive the hour and fifteen minutes out to the faire grounds? I just don‚Äôt know if it is possible. 

I wish I lived in a city. I wish I could walk places and do things like that. I don‚Äôt even want to do anything special. I want to buy my own groceries instead of needing to use Instacart. I want to go to the hardware store and buy paint and paint a room. I want to do SOMETHING. 

But I live in a suburban hellscape and I am traumatized and scared of everything, no matter how many meds I take (6) or how many years of therapy I do (19).

1hc744d,https://www.reddit.com/r/latterdaysaints/comments/1hc744d/hold_nothing_back_from_god/,Hold Nothing Back From God,"Every Melchizedek Priesthood holder makes a covenant to live by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God. President Nelson has taught that the Oath and Covenant of the Priesthood applies to endowed women as well.

Besides the Oath and Covenant of the Priesthood, all baptized members covenant to keep God‚Äôs commandments. All endowed members covenant to obey all of God‚Äôs commandments, sacrifice anything that may be necessary to follow Christ, and consecrate everything to the Church for the building up of God‚Äôs kingdom.

God wants all of us: our heart, might, mind, and strength. This isn‚Äôt new. He‚Äôs always wanted all of us. There is no part He wants us to hold back from Him.

Of course, none of us are perfect at this. But, it‚Äôs usually pretty clear who has an ‚ÄúI‚Äôm all in‚Äù or a ‚ÄúI am going to hold something back‚Äù attitude.

I‚Äôm not saying all ‚Äúnuanced‚Äù members are like this. However, if someone defines themself as ‚Äúnuanced,‚Äù because they know the commandments taught by the Church and choose purposely to disagree and not to follow them, then they aren‚Äôt giving everything to God. Being disobedient and calling it ‚Äúnuance‚Äù is not approved in God‚Äôs eyes.

If a person decides to drink coffee because ‚ÄúGod isn‚Äôt going to keep me out of heaven because I drink coffee,‚Äù then that person isn‚Äôt giving everything to God. They also haven‚Äôt taken the time to study and pray about the Word of Wisdom, or perhaps the Restoration, sincerely. They think they are better than God‚Äôs prophets - which is a pride issue. I‚Äôm not their judge as to whether or not they‚Äôll go to the celestial kingdom - but I can say that their attitude is not in line with God‚Äôs will.

Now, if there is another person that is unknowingly not following some instruction (maybe someone that didn‚Äôt know about a certain commandment in the scriptures), but later learns about it and resolves immediately to strive to live but it: that‚Äôs the attitude the Lord wants. It‚Äôs an attitude of constant repentance and always seeking to humble one‚Äôs self as a little child.

‚ÄúNot every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.‚Äù - Matthew 7:21

Keep in mind: I‚Äôm not talking about people who consider themselves nuanced in their theology/beliefs.  I‚Äôm talking about what actions come of those beliefs. If you believe the Word of Wisdom isn‚Äôt necessarily inspired and may just be a remnant of the 18th/19th century temperance movements, but you keep it anyway because you promised to follow the prophet - you‚Äôll still be blessed.

I use the Word of Wisdom in my examples here, but this applies to other things too.

For example, I really don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a whole lot of nuance available when it comes to the Sabbath Day. The commandment is clear: ‚ÄúKeep the Sabbath Day holy.‚Äù Are you doing ‚Äúholy‚Äù things on that day? Things that are separate from you from the world? Or are you doing worldly things on that day? Things that bring you closer to the world? The prophets have given us some instruction on what we should and shouldn‚Äôt do. But, they have recently been going away from prescription for our Sabbath practices - not because there aren‚Äôt definite things we should and shouldn‚Äôt do, but because President Nelson has been begging us to get better at seeking revelation and being better Latter-day Saints and followers of God. If you really studied the Sabbath Day in the scriptures in all standard works, and prayed about the Sabbath to know what to do, it‚Äôd be 100% crystal clear to you how God wants you to spend your Sabbath.

Now, God is the only one who knows if you‚Äôve really put that effort in. And you can‚Äôt deceive Him, even if you deceive your Bishop and everyone around you, including yourself. He‚Äôs the judge - not me - as to whether you really are all in or not. 

And I hope that all of us, at that last day, will be able to look God in the eyes and say, ‚ÄúI loved you with my whole life. I gave everything for you and lost my life in service to you, just as your Son, Christ, asked. I wasn‚Äôt perfect, but every time I recognized my actions and attitudes weren‚Äôt aligned with your will, I did my best to repent and rectify that. I always sustained your prophets. I did everything I could to build up your kingdom. I did everything I could to live by all of your words and I held nothing back from you.‚Äù

And then, at that day, He will say to us in return: ‚ÄúWell done, my faithful son/daughter. I too will hold nothing back from you.‚Äù

Remember: it‚Äôs not God‚Äôs love for us that is being tested in this life; it‚Äôs our love for God.",0,1733959105.0,latterdaysaints,19,0.48,False

This past Thanksgiving, I (37M) was over at my Aunt's house and there's 9 of us together, including my great aunt and her ""friend"" who often attends our family get togethers but I actually don't have any idea what his actual status or relationship is. Usually he's just a quiet old man who's happy to eat the food and listen to the family conversation.

This time we started playing a board game after Thanksgiving dinner and at some point, a relative made a simple mistake which led to another jokingly asking if they were high. 

We laughed it off and went to move on but then this Boomer guy says, ""You know, I remember reading a study published by a well known doctor who found that regularly smoking the marijuana will alter the DNA of a woman's baby. And the side effects are really serious because the baby can be born with an exposed spine or be missing organs and need special machines to live if they can't get an immediate organ transplant. All because the mother decided to smoke the marijuana. How crazy is that?""

There was a *ahem* rather pregnant pause at the table before I spoke up and said, ""Is that so? I'd really be interested in reading that study. Who was the doctor that published it?""

To which he replied, ""Oh, I uh, I don't really recall his full name right now. But he was a doctor. And he was very well known in the 70's. His study, I remember, was very well received.""

And I said, ""Really? So, barely 20 years after Watson and Crick ""discovered"" that human DNA was a double helix made of 4 base pairs, this doctor who's name you don't remember was able to determine that pregnant women will change the DNA of their unborn babies so much that they will ultimately be born with horrible and potentially life threatening conditions, if they simply smoke marijuana? I kinda have to say, I'm really skeptical of that. Namely because I've never heard of a single case of that happening. Ever.""

At this point, I was laughing on the inside and also trying hard not to call him an idiot. The rest of my family was exchanging glances at this point and my Mom kicked me under the table, so I knew they wanted me to drop it.

He stammered, ""Well like I said, it was a big study in the 70's. I guess they wouldn't have covered it back when you were in school but yeah, terrible thing to see, I'm sure. Anyway, who's up next? I'm gonna get some more pie real quick.""

And then he jumped up and went to the kitchen, where he stayed for like 10 minutes ""getting pie"" while we all started the next round of the game and just kind of dropped the whole thing. My Mom glared at me but didn't say anything. I smiled and winked at her and she rolled her eyes and we all moved on.

Eventually he came back with a coffee, sat down, and barely said another word the rest of the evening. 

It's just, it was Such a stupid thing to double down on and maybe I was the asshole for basically calling him out on it but... Exposed spines and missing organs? Rewriting your baby's DNA because you smoked a joint? SMH, I guess that old Devil's Lettuce Propaganda really runs deep in the Boomer Generation.

1hc6vwd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hc6vwd/aita_for_stalking_my_nowhusband_and_manipulating/,AITA for stalking my now-husband and manipulating his breakup with his ex?,"When I (28F) was 19, it was my freshman year of university. I‚Äôd taken a gap year to work as an au pair in Japan, so I started a bit later than most of my peers. I didn‚Äôt have many friends until I met Jessi (19F), and we instantly clicked. She became my go-to friend, and one day, she invited me to her birthday party‚Äîa small gathering with close friends.

That‚Äôs when I met Kylin (27M). He was older, gorgeous, and had this presence about him that left me awestruck. But he wasn‚Äôt single‚Äîhe was in a serious, two-year relationship with Niah (25F). Jessi noticed my instant crush on him but told me it was pointless to even think about because Kylin and Niah were rock-solid.

I didn‚Äôt care.

At the party, I talked to both Kylin and Niah, trying to get a feel for who she was and what their relationship was like. I got both of their Instagrams and started keeping tabs on them, stalking every move they made. I wasn‚Äôt looking for anything specific‚Äîjust one slip-up on Niah‚Äôs part that I could use to my advantage.


That‚Äôs when I noticed something‚ÄîNiah had a tendency to overdo it with alcohol when she went out. It wasn‚Äôt extreme, but it was enough for me to see an opportunity. I realized that if I could create a scenario where she made a mistake while drunk, I could push Kylin to see her in a different light.

One night, I invited Jessi and Niah out for drinks, pretending it was just a casual girls‚Äô night. While we were out, I purposefully ordered a lot of drinks for Jess and Ni (I didnt drink since I was the chaperone) this made her act out of character. I encouraged her to take more shots and adivised her to hit it up with this guy who had been eyeing her all night, so I encouraged her to talk to him while I ""Recorded a Snap."" I purposefully filmed myself having a good time, making sure Niah was in the background dancing with the guy, looking a little too friendly.

The next day, Kylin saw the video. They broke up.

It was messy. Niah didn‚Äôt remember much from that night and thought the situation was just a mistake on her part. She didn‚Äôt blame me for anything, assuming I had accidentally caught her on camera. She took the breakup hard but accepted that it was ""her fault.""

That‚Äôs when I stepped in.

I started comforting Kylin, being there for him as a shoulder to cry on. We bonded over coffee dates and deep conversations about his feelings. He helped me with my major (he did the same major as I was) and I took things slow, knowing he needed time to heal. Months passed, and one day, while we were eating at In-N-Out‚Äîof all places‚Äîhe kissed me. It was cheesy, but it was perfect.

We started dating, and over time, things got serious. Niah eventually moved abroad for work, and we lost contact with her completely. Three years later, Kylin proposed. Now, we‚Äôre married, and I‚Äôm 20 weeks pregnant with our baby girl.

Here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm conflicted: I love Kylin with everything I have. He‚Äôs the perfect man‚Äîkind, hardworking, and everything I ever wanted. But I can‚Äôt shake the guilt of how we started. I manipulated things to get him, and while I‚Äôd do it all over again because I love him but, I do wonder if I crossed a line too far.

So, AITA for how I got my husband? Or did I just do what I needed to push fate to secure my happiness?

**10.  Feid -** This one will anger many of you.  In my defense, Feid is a good artist.  Good, not great.  Has the potential to be great but I cannot interpret from a distance what the cause may be that prevents him from creating great music on a consistent level.  I think he may be overworked.  He's writing for countless other artists and is one of the busiest performers traveling the world.  I saw the amount of performances he has lately and I'm guesstimating he's at around 50-60 live events a year +.  He put out 3 full length albums in a year and a half.  Someone at his status should be allowed to take their time.  I know you must strike while the iron is hot but there is such a thing as overexposure and exhaustion.  This guy must drink a lot of coffee...  But the result has been underwhelming projects.  I know he has a joint venture, but those deals can be limiting even though you are supposed to be your own boss sometimes.  Especially if you sign a 360 joint venture which most artists do today.  The labels might still pressure you into doing more than necessary and with the money Feid must be getting now per event (at least 6 figures), maybe you cannot blame him for acquiescing.  The end result has been 3 products that were subpar though Ferxxocalipsis was decent.  And this was after he put out ""Feliz Cumplea√±os..."" which will one day be considered an all-time classic.  He is diluting his own catalog as he does not have the Midas touch every time.

**9.  Karol G -** Another artist who is good and has really a 'Beyhive' kinda thing going on her with her core Latino fanbase.  This has them overrates her work.  Yes, the Academy gave her 'Grammy Album Of The Year' in 2023 on all categories and when you compare ""Ma√±ana Sera Bonito"" to most Latin Pop, she probably deserved it.  But that was not the best Latin Urban of 2023, the Academy just doesn't know better and they never will.  Rap & Reggaeton just isn't their thing and probably will never be save a few occasions.  None of Karol G's albums are even better than Ivy's 3 best in ""The Original Rude Girl"", ""En Mi Imperio"" and ""Diva"".  That's not including ""Flashback"" which is a greatest hits compilation with 5 new songs.  She's good, but her fans overrate her too much.

**8.  J Balvin -** He was good for his time, but if he ever put out an album like ""Feliz Cumplea√±os..."" he would have won every award as Balvin's albums have never been that good quality wise.  But he's the guy you can't hate on and is good enough, but far from great.

How can you go from being one of the most revolutionary artists and a lyrical heavyweight to what he is today where he is 0-4 in all his battles.  His songs have become a parody of himself and sound like he freestyled them while on the toilet.  When he first blew up with the original 'Real Hasta La Muerte Mixtape' (Rating: 9/10) he was something special.  Then he just fell off and got worse every year, though he became more popular than ever.  ""Emmanuel"" had its moments and was a pretty solid effort but was not the classic he could have made (Rating: 8/10).  And afterwards his catalog has just gotten worse every year.  Sometimes he shows a semblance of that special spark from his initial buzz, but often he just ruins it with throwaway lyrics about killing people or pointless sex.  It has gotten boring and an Anuel cosign has almost become meaningless because of it.

**Anuel AA - Las Leyendas Nunca Mueren (2021)  Rating:  6.5/10**

**Anuel AA - LLNM 2 Rating: 7.5/10  too long** 

**6.  Porta -** This guy was hyped as the next Nach in Spain.  And he was nowhere near that.  He tries to sound smart but sounds like that college student who just found out through his professor people have it hard in 3rd world countries.  He tried to be deep but sounded so vain.  Some people loved him, but others hated him more.  Had he not been so hyped up, he might have done ok as he is not a bad rapper.  Boring as F though.

**5.  Mau & Ricky -** These guys suck!  If Camilo wasn't related to them, they would be nowhere.  Dull, meaningless bubble gum pop with at best 2-3 decent songs in their entire catalog and even those are throwaways.  These two are among the worst things that happened to Reggaeton.  They should have just kept their terrible music Pop and gotten the hell out of this music.  They are awful... just awful.

**4.  Piso 21 & CNCO (tie)** \- Good idea... a boyband but in Reggaeton.  But RKM & Ken-Y blew up because they made good music, not just clever marketing and social media tie ins.  The execution was a HUGE failure.  These guys were supposed to be bigger than Menudo and the labels threw millions of dollars behind them just to lose it all.  You won't find a Harry Styles or Justin Timberlake here because unlike N'Sync or One Direction, there is very little talent to find in Piso 21 and CNCO.  They both suck!

**3.  Mike Bahia** \- I hate this guy.  He markets himself as being the Alejandro Sanz of Reggaeton and just makes bad music.  He thinks he is more sophisticated than Reggaeton and has no idea how to write a good Pop song.  No one cares you play the guitar, you still suck!  Generic, vacuous and soulless Pop music is what Mike Bahia creates.  I feel sorry for you if you think he's half as great as he thinks he is.  If he wasn't so pretentious, I wouldn't be half as harsh on him.  I hate when people look down on the Reggaeton and then their music is atrocious.  Just because they play an instrument or make terrible ballads, they think it gives them a right to look down on an entire culture.  Right a decent Pop song first, jerk!

***2.  Residente -*** Great Lyricist and Rapper, but he is so dull musically sometimes and in trying to expand his sound too much, he misses more than he hits.  That is why his only good music lately has been songs where he's dissing other Rappers.  He doesn't focus on his strength.  He can't sing so I don't know why he tries to be the next Silvio Rodriguez or Gustavo Cerati at times.  Visitante's production is also to blame as sometimes they appear to just want to be different for the sake of being different and the result gets mixed reviews.  Sure, the Mercedes Sosa and Pablo Milanes fans who pretend to listen to Residente Calle 13's albums acclaim only because they don't like Reggaeton or Latin Rap and Resident often deliberately is anti Reggaeton and anti Rap... and he might be the best freakin' Rapper in the world!  But he holds it back to experiment often with disastrous and boring results.  I know I am not the only Rap-Reggaeton aficionado annoyed by this.  Why would you refuse to be great just to piss off your fans!?

**1.  Maluma -** Very average artist, but the in the Pop world only Daddy Yankee and Bad Bunny are ahead of him (the Latin Pop world barely know Vico C and Tego though they pretend to sometimes).  One day the rest of the world will see Maluma how the true Rap and Reggaeton connoisseurs do.  The guy sold a lot of records and made his contributions but overall he was.... MEH.  Not bad, but not at all great either.

*\*Bonus  Reviews of the Maluma albums I heard in their entirety.*

I tried to hear ""Papi Juancho"" but couldn't get through it.  I hated what i heard though.  I know he tries hard, but athletes don't earn medals for ""trying"".  Music should be the same, but his fans love the guy for some reason.  I find him a little pretentious, nowhere near as bad as Mike Bahia.",5,1733958256.0,Reggaeton,25,0.61,False

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it‚Äôs you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength‚ÄîI wish I‚Äôd had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There‚Äôs so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it‚Äôs not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian‚Äîyour mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she‚Äôs gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I‚Äôve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I‚Äôm certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup‚Äôs rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn‚Äôt know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you‚Äôll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I‚Äôm deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea‚Äôs trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, ‚ÄúW-what does this mean?‚Äù

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. ‚ÄúNot here, not now. Let‚Äôs get home, then we can talk.‚Äù

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother‚Äôs shrill voice called after them, ‚ÄúLeaving already? You haven‚Äôt stayed for lunch.‚Äù

Sorin‚Äôs jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.‚Äù With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. ‚ÄúDamn it, damn it, damn it.‚Äù

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea‚Äôs gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

‚ÄúD-do you‚Ä¶ think this could really be true?‚Äù Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. ‚ÄúLook, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might‚Äôve signed, we‚Äôll have proof.‚Äù He paused, deep in thought. ‚ÄúDad must have something lying around.‚Äù A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. ‚ÄúWhy did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could‚Äôve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!‚Äù

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. ‚ÄúWe‚Ä¶ we don‚Äôt really know what was going on back then‚Ä¶‚Äù

A sob erupted from him. ‚ÄúI loved him so much, Drea. I don‚Äôt remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end‚Ä¶‚Äù

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another‚Äôs embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, ‚ÄúCall Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.‚Äù

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn‚Äôt rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it! That woman is going to pay today. I‚Äôve tolerated her long enough!‚Äù He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

‚ÄúAdrian, no!‚Äù

We‚Äôve all been there: that fleeting moment of self-consciousness after a garlicky lunch or first-thing-in-the-morning coffee breath. While brushing, flossing, and mouthwash are essential, they only address surface issues. What if I told you the secret to truly fresh breath and optimal oral health might lie within‚Ä¶ your gut? Yep, you read that right! We‚Äôre diving deep into the fascinating world of dental probiotics, those microscopic heroes that can revolutionize your mouth‚Äôs ecosystem. Get ready to discover how these tiny organisms can pack a powerful punch against bad breath, gum disease, and even cavities.

Best Dental Probiotics: A Deep Dive into Oral Health
----------------------------------------------------

Before we unveil our top picks for the best dental probiotics, let's understand why these friendly bacteria are so important. Our mouths, like our guts, are teeming with bacteria ‚Äì both good and bad. When this delicate balance gets thrown off, problems can arise. Think of it like a garden: if you neglect it, weeds will take over. Similarly, an imbalance of oral bacteria can lead to plaque buildup, bad breath (halitosis), gingivitis, and even more serious conditions like periodontitis. Dental probiotics work by introducing beneficial bacteria, crowding out the harmful ones, and restoring balance to your oral microbiome.

### Understanding the Oral Microbiome

Your oral microbiome is a complex and dynamic community of microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses, that reside in your mouth. This bustling metropolis of microbes plays a crucial role in maintaining oral health. A balanced microbiome helps protect against harmful pathogens, contributes to healthy gums, and even influences your overall well-being. Think of your mouth as a gateway to your body; keeping it healthy has far-reaching effects.

### Why Choose Probiotics for Oral Health?

Now, you might be thinking, ""Why probiotics? Why not just stick to regular brushing and flossing?"" Well, while these practices are undoubtedly crucial, they can sometimes miss the mark. They‚Äôre like cleaning your house but forgetting to disinfect. Probiotics, on the other hand, get to the root of the problem by modulating the bacterial population itself. They offer a more holistic and preventative approach to oral health, tackling issues from the inside out.

Best Dental Probiotics: Top Strains for a Healthier Smile
---------------------------------------------------------

So, which strains are the heavy hitters in the world of oral health? Let‚Äôs explore some of the most researched and effective strains, along with their benefits.

1. **Streptococcus salivarius K12:** This strain is a true champion against bad breath. It produces a compound called BLIS K12, which inhibits the growth of volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs), the main culprits behind that dreaded morning breath. Studies have shown that S. salivarius K12 can significantly reduce VSC levels and improve overall oral hygiene.
2. **Lactobacillus reuteri:** This versatile probiotic isn't just good for your gut; it's a superstar for oral health too! L. reuteri has been shown to inhibit the growth of harmful bacteria like Streptococcus mutans, a major contributor to cavities. It also helps reduce inflammation in the gums, making it a valuable ally in the fight against gingivitis.
3. **Lactobacillus paracasei:** Another powerhouse probiotic, L. paracasei, strengthens the body's immune response against periodontal pathogens. It's like having tiny bodyguards patrolling your gums, keeping harmful bacteria at bay. Studies suggest that this strain can significantly improve gum health and reduce bleeding.
4. **Bifidobacterium infantis:** While often associated with infant gut health, B. infantis also boasts some impressive oral benefits. It has been shown to reduce inflammation in the gums and improve overall oral hygiene scores.

Best Dental Probiotics: Choosing the Right Product
--------------------------------------------------

Finding the best dental probiotics can feel like navigating a maze. With so many products on the market, how do you choose the right one? Here are a few key factors to consider:

### Strain Specificity

Not all probiotics are created equal. Look for products that clearly list the specific strains they contain, along with their CFU count (colony forming units). A higher CFU count generally indicates a more potent product. Remember, it's not just about the quantity but also the quality and type of strains.

### Delivery Method

Dental probiotics come in various forms, including lozenges, tablets, chewing gum, and powders. Choose a delivery method that suits your lifestyle and preferences. Lozenges and chewing gum, for instance, allow the probiotics to directly interact with your oral tissues.

### Reputable Brands and Third-Party Testing

Opt for reputable brands that prioritize quality and transparency. Look for products that have undergone third-party testing to verify their potency and purity. This ensures you‚Äôre getting what you pay for and that the product contains the stated strains and CFU count.

Best Dental Probiotics: Beyond the Basics
-----------------------------------------

Probiotics are just one piece of the oral health puzzle. For optimal results, combine them with a solid oral hygiene routine, including:

- **Brushing twice a day:** This is non-negotiable. Use fluoride toothpaste and brush for at least two minutes each time.
- **Flossing daily:** Flossing removes plaque and food particles from between your teeth, where your toothbrush can‚Äôt reach.
- **Regular dental checkups:** Visiting your dentist regularly for professional cleanings and checkups is crucial for preventing and addressing any potential issues.
- **Healthy diet:** Limit sugary drinks and snacks, which fuel the growth of harmful bacteria.

Best Dental Probiotics: A Holistic Approach to Oral Wellness
------------------------------------------------------------

Think about it ‚Äì wouldn't it be amazing to have a smile that not only looks great but also feels fantastic? Dental probiotics offer a proactive and holistic approach to oral health, empowering you to take control of your mouth's ecosystem. By nurturing the good bacteria, you can create a thriving oral environment that naturally combats bad breath, gum disease, and cavities. It‚Äôs time to ditch the quick fixes and embrace a long-term strategy for a healthier, happier smile! What are you waiting for? Jump on the probiotic bandwagon and experience the transformative power of these microscopic marvels! You‚Äôll thank yourself (and your dentist) later.

Conclusion
----------

The journey to optimal oral health is an ongoing one, and incorporating the best dental probiotics into your routine can be a game-changer. By understanding the intricate workings of the oral microbiome and choosing the right probiotic strains, you can equip your mouth with the tools it needs to thrive. Remember that probiotics are not a magic bullet; they work best as part of a comprehensive approach to oral care.

===========================

""Discover the SECRET of Fresh breath for Dog https://freepage.pro/samutores/dogfresh""

Fresh breath might seem like a luxury when it comes to our furry friends, but for many dog owners, bad breath is an unfortunate reality. Just as you might wrinkle your nose at the smell of something unpleasant, dogs can also harbor odors that make us question their dental hygiene. The question then arises: what causes dog bad breath? Understanding the root causes is key to tackling this issue head-on and ensuring that our canine companions stay healthy and happy.

In this article, we‚Äôll delve into the various reasons behind bad breath in dogs, from dental conditions to dietary choices, and everything in between. You‚Äôll learn how to identify the signs and symptoms, preventive measures you can take, and the best practices for maintaining your dog‚Äôs oral health.

The Underlying Causes of Bad Breath in Dogs
-------------------------------------------

Bad breath, or halitosis as the vets like to call it, is often more than just a nuisance; it can be a symptom of underlying health issues. So, what exactly causes dog bad breath? The mouth, much like a garden, requires maintenance. If left unattended, bacteria thrive, leading to not-so-pleasant odors. Let‚Äôs dig deeper into the most common culprits of bad breath in our furry friends, shall we?

### 1. Dental Issues: The Primary Offender

When it comes to dog bad breath, dental problems are often the first culprit that comes to mind. Just like us, dogs can develop plaque and tartar on their teeth, which can lead to gum disease and tooth decay.

#### Signs of Dental Problems

- **Plaque and Tartar Accumulation**: Look for yellowish-brown buildup on teeth.
- **Gum Inflammation**: Swollen or bleeding gums can be a sign of gingivitis.
- **Excessive Drooling**: Is your dog slobbering more than usual?
- **Difficulty Eating**: Reluctance to chew or play with toys can indicate discomfort.

If you notice these signs, it might be time to schedule a visit to the vet for a thorough dental check-up.

### 2. Diet and Nutrition: What Goes In Matters

Ever heard the saying, ‚ÄúYou are what you eat‚Äù? Well, that rings true for dogs too! A poor diet can lead to unpleasant smells wafting from your pup's mouth.

#### Common Dietary Contributors

- **Low-Quality Dog Food**: Cheap kibble often lacks necessary nutrients and may contribute to bad breath.
- **Unusual Treats**: Some snacks, especially those high in sugar or artificial preservatives, can upset your dog's gut and breath.
- **Leftovers and Human Food**: Giving your dog table scraps might seem harmless, but certain foods can wreak havoc on their digestive system.

### 3. Health Conditions: Beyond the Mouth

While dental issues and diet are significant contributors, don‚Äôt forget that other health conditions can also lead to foul breath. Sometimes, bad breath can be a window into the internal health of your dog.

#### Conditions to Watch For

- **Kidney Disease**: A distinct, urine-like odor can be associated with kidney problems.
- **Diabetes**: Sweet-smelling breath may indicate uncontrolled diabetes.
- **Liver Disease**: A rancid, musty odor might suggest liver dysfunction.

If your dog‚Äôs breath suddenly changes, it‚Äôs crucial to consult your veterinarian, as early detection can make all the difference.

### 4. Oral Hygiene: The Key to Prevention

Just like we brush our teeth regularly, keeping our dogs‚Äô mouths clean is essential to avoid that dreaded bad breath.

#### Oral Care Tips

- **Regular Teeth Brushing**: Aim to brush your dog‚Äôs teeth several times a week using dog-friendly toothpaste.
- **Dental Chews and Toys**: These can help reduce plaque while keeping your dog entertained.
- **Routine Vet Check-Ups**: Regular dental cleanings can prevent serious dental issues down the line.

### 5. Aging: The Inevitable Factor

As dogs age, they may become more prone to dental diseases due to wear and tear. This doesn‚Äôt mean we should throw in the towel; instead, let‚Äôs focus on tailored care!

#### Caring for Senior Dogs

- **Gentle Oral Care**: Use softer brushes and dental products formulated for seniors.
- **Regular Monitoring**: Keep an eye on any changes in breath and eating habits.
- **Alternative Nutrition**: Consult with your vet about senior-focused diets that promote oral health.

How to Identify Bad Breath in Dogs
----------------------------------

So, how can you tell if your dog has bad breath? It‚Äôs not always as obvious as one might think! Here‚Äôs a handy checklist that can help you gauge whether your pup needs a little extra TLC in the hygiene department.

### Symptoms of Halitosis

1. **Unpleasant Odor**: If your dog‚Äôs breath smells like rotten eggs or fish, it‚Äôs time for action.
2. **Behavior Changes**: If your furry friend seems reluctant to eat or plays less than usual, pay attention.
3. **Excessive Licking**: Dogs may lick their lips more often if they‚Äôre experiencing oral discomfort.
4. **Visible Tartar Buildup**: Look closely at those pearly whites; discoloration can hint at bigger problems.

Overall, keeping tabs on your dog's dental and overall health is essential to catch any issues early on.

Practical Steps to Freshen Your Dog's Breath
--------------------------------------------

Now that we‚Äôve highlighted the potential causes of dog bad breath, let's focus on actionable steps to keep your canine companion's breath fresher than a spring morning!

### 1. Establish a Routine Dental Care Plan

Creating a dental care routine is the backbone of maintaining your dog‚Äôs oral health. Just like setting a time for your morning coffee, it‚Äôs important to incorporate oral hygiene into your pet care schedule.

#### Suggested Routine

- **Daily Brushing**: Aim for daily brushing, but start slow if your dog isn‚Äôt used to it.
- **Dental Products**: Invest in quality toothbrushes and toothpaste designed specifically for dogs.
- **Water Additives**: Consider adding a vet-approved water additive to your dog‚Äôs drinking water for an extra cleaning boost.

### 2. Choose the Right Diet

Switching to the right diet can have amazing effects on your dog's overall health, including freshening their breath.

#### Choosing Dog Food Wisely

- **Read Labels**: Look for high-quality protein sources and avoid fillers.
- **Incorporate Raw Veggies**: Carrots, apples, and other crunchy treats can naturally clean teeth.
- **Limit Treats**: Be mindful of the quantity and quality of treats you‚Äôre feeding.

### 3. Schedule Regular Vet Visits

Taking your dog to the vet regularly is akin to keeping up with your own health check-ups. Regular professional cleanings can make all the difference.

#### Vet Recommendations

- **Twice-Yearly Cleanings**: Depending on your dog's size and breed, you may need to visit the vet more frequently.
- **Health Assessments**: Don‚Äôt shy away from discussing any sudden changes in breath with your vet.

### 4. Homemade Remedies to Combat Bad Breath

If you‚Äôre feeling adventurous, why not whip up some homemade remedies that can help combat bad breath?

#### Simple DIY Solutions

- **Coconut Oil Rub**: Incorporate coconut oil into your dog‚Äôs diet. It‚Äôs known for its antibacterial properties!
- **Parsley and Mint**: A pinch of parsley or mint can help freshen your dog‚Äôs breath naturally.
- **Apple Cider Vinegar**: Dilute ACV in water and use it as a rinse (make sure it‚Äôs safe and suitable for dogs).

Conclusion: Wrapping It Up
--------------------------

In conclusion, the question ‚Äúwhat causes dog bad breath?‚Äù leads us down an important path of understanding our furry friends' health needs. From dental diseases and poor diet choices to underlying health problems, there are numerous factors at play.

Paying attention to your dog‚Äôs oral hygiene, diet, and regular vet check-ups can go a long way toward preventing bad breath and promoting overall well-being. By implementing practical steps like establishing a dental care routine and being careful with their diet, you can preserve not just their breath but also their health.

Remember, your dog relies on you for every aspect of their care, so taking an active role in their dental hygiene isn‚Äôt just beneficial; it‚Äôs a way to show love and commitment. You'll be rewarded with wet-nosed kisses and wagging tails‚Äînow that's a win-win!

- could the coffee have impacted my score? When I checked in to labs they said I should be fasted but didn‚Äôt seem to care I wasn‚Äôt, and didn‚Äôt get a baseline level.

- anyone else here with that score or similar have anecdotal examples of how things went with you?

- if I do not have gestational diabetes but am having some insulin resistance is it advisable to follow the diabetic diet (if not super strictly) just to help?

Thanks so much in advance!!

That is a bag of whole grain rice that is in a bowl with a lid, that has been in my cabinet below the counter for maybe 5 months. There are so many of them. What are they?? How do I kill them? How do I make sure they never return to my home again?
There were some what I assume to be dead ones in the cabinet. I thought it was like dirt or coffee grounds or something so I just wiped them out. But after I opened the bowl I realized those were, whatever the hell those bugs are, corpses.

1hc6n6f,https://i.redd.it/qb6r6fnwua6e1.jpeg,Nostalgia In A Bottle,"A coworker won this at the company Christmas party last year, I believe our boss was cleaning out her liquor room (yes, _room_). They knew I was a scotch drinker so it ended up in my liquor cabinet. It sat collecting dust for a year. At a recent dusting I decided to glance at values online. They had gone up considerably so I decided the time had come to just drink the darn thing. What‚Äôs the use of having an expensive bottle of whisky it you don‚Äôt know how it tastes? 

First tasting was in a Glencairn but this isn‚Äôt that kind of dram. This is a working man‚Äôs liquor from a simpler time so into the lowball glass it went. 

I‚Äôm more of an Ardbeg and Laphroaig guy my self so my scotch tasting senses are a bit smoked at this point.

Color: The driest hay you‚Äôve ever seen. Pale. 

Nose: Is pale a scent? Really getting your nose in the glass digs up the fading memories of Star fruit and underripe loquat. 

Taste: Still on the pale spectrum. Every aspect of this whisky is so slight and unobtrusive almost to its detriment. More passing suggestions of light fruits and a bit of apricot jam up front followed by a quick hit of Demerara sugar sweetness.

Finish: Olsen twins thin mouthfeel. A quick bit of alcohol heat that fades swiftly into oak and dry coffee creamer.
 
Is this a great old whisky? Absolutely not. Is it overpriced because people just want something out of production‚Ä¶ 100 percent. 

It is one of the most accessible Single Malts (Pure Malt according to the label) ever made and was the reason a lot of us made the leap from blended to Single Malts in the first place.  That fancy sleeve and that sharp triangular bottle just screamed tasteful.

All I‚Äôm saying is drink the stuff you‚Äôve got laying around, it‚Äôs not getting any better. Do I wish I had squirreled away a few bottles of Laphroaig 15? Sure, but I would have missed out on enjoying them when I did.",17,1733957844.0,Scotch,7,1.0,False

I count kilojoules instead of calories as well (helps with not being so obsessed with the amount of calories and has really helped me lose a lot of weight). ",2,1733957825.0,loseit,5,0.67,False

1hc6lud,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1hc6lud/quitting_coffee_after_8_years_for_hopes_of_better/,Quitting coffee after 8 years for hopes of better sleep. Seeking support...,"For the better part of the past 8 years, aside from a few attempts at cutting back and/or quitting, I have finally reached a point where I am attempting to be done as in REALLY done for the first time. I have been sleeping poorly what I'd estimate to be 60% of the time for many years now and while initially anxiety was a big problem, when that issue went away, sleep never quite got back to being 100%. Right around the time my anxiety/sleep issues began though, is when I introduced coffee into my morning routine.

Slowly but very surely, I became a full blown addict. That said, I only consumed one cup a day, on average of around 9am. For years all I read and heard about was that one cup in no way can really have a legitimate affect your sleep. But as well all know, there are cases (albeit more rare) when coffee, even as little as one cup, can in fact be disruptive to ones sleep. This actually isn't a newfound thought of how caffeine could be the culprit in my ongoing sleep troubles. During my previous attempts at quitting, I clearly remember sleeping a little better, but eventually I'd have a few rough nights and would think ok, it can't be the coffee after all. Back to the morning cup I'd go.

My sleep issues range from not being able to fall asleep for up to an hour, to waking in the middle of the night, to simply having weak/broken sleep overall. Even if I do have a good night, a majority of the time I will not feel completely rested. I also rarely and do mean rarely ever get that super tired/drowsy feeling around bedtime like I used to get back in the day. Perhaps for a little more context, I am an extremely thin guy, standing 6'2 and weighing about 145 lbs. Generally speaking from experience in life with regard to being quite prone to side effects from medications and drugs I've taken over the years, I would not be surprised if I had a strong caffeine sensitivity. While only time will tell, I am currently 3 days in and based on all I've read, things will likely get worse before they possibly get better. I had a horrible night of sleep last night and would have killed for a cup this morning. But I know that now at age 40 and having sleep troubles on and off for many years, the time has come to give this a real go.

I guess I'm wondering how likely it really is that my addiction to one cup of coffee every morning is the culprit to my sleep issues and if so, how long people think it might really take to see things take a turn for the better.",2,1733957748.0,decaf,7,1.0,False
