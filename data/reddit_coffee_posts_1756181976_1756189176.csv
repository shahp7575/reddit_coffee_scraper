Book a Free Water Test Today,"When you turn on the tap in your Miami home, the water may look clean—but that doesn’t mean it’s safe. A 2024 report from the Environmental Working Group found PFAS (also known as “forever chemicals”) in parts of Miami-Dade’s water system. These chemicals don’t break down easily and may stay in your body for years.

That’s why getting a [**Free Water Test in Miami**](https://alpineperfect.com/) is more important than ever. It's the simplest way to see if your home's water has problems like chlorine, heavy metals, or hard water minerals. These can impact your health and daily life.

If something’s off, you’ll get clear, no-pressure guidance on choosing the right Water Filtration System in Miami. In this blog, we’ll explore why water purity matters, how to check what’s really in your drinking water, and simple ways to test it at home. 

# What’s Really in Your Tap Water?

What’s in your water might surprise you! Even if you drink water, the water from your taps still touches your life every day, whether it’s for rinsing food, brushing teeth, making coffee, or taking a shower. If that water has hidden contaminants, you and your family may be exposed in ways you don’t realize. A Free Water Test Miami can uncover what’s really coming through your faucet and help you make informed choices. 

Common contaminants in Miami homes include:

• **PFAS (forever chemicals)** that stay in the body and raise health concerns

• **Chlorine, lead, and sediment** that affect taste, smell, and water clarity

• **Hard water minerals** that dry out your skin and leave white buildup everywhere

If you're living in Miami, a water filtration system is more than a convenience. It's a practical way to reduce exposure to chemicals like arsenic, nitrates, trihalomethanes, and chromium, many of which exceed safe limits.

# What are the Water Quality Challenges in Miami

In Miami, tests found PFAS (forever chemicals) at levels as high as 36 parts per trillion for PFOS and 11 parts per trillion for PFOA in some samples, exceeding the level of a single drop in 20 Olympic‑sized pools ([source](https://www.hydroviv.com/blogs/water-quality-report/miami?srsltid=AfmBOoouLyeKMERj2ve5ipYROvkv0PFLb9wRiHEuHFdLBxAy4ppvrYso&utm_source=chatgpt.com)). That number may not sound dramatic, but these substances are persistent and can add up over time in everyday use.

Here are common water issues homeowners might encounter:

* PFAS from firefighting foam, packaging, and industrial sources
* Chloramines and chlorine that affect taste and skin feel
* Lead entering water from older plumbing systems
* Hard water causes scale, spotting, and dry skin
* Emerging contaminants like chromium-6 and arsenic, linked to pipes and soil

# How a Water Filtration System Helps Miami Homes 

Tap water in Miami can carry minerals, chlorine, and other substances that affect its quality. These elements may cause scale buildup on fixtures, cloudiness on glassware, and dryness in skin and hair. Over time, they can also reduce the efficiency and lifespan of household appliances.

It reduces buildup, supports softer skin and hair, and keeps fixtures and appliances clean. Every recommendation is tailored to your water, your home's size, and your family's water usage.

I’m a shy, intelligent, creative, playful, romantic “old-fashioned gentleman” seeking a soulmate to share magnetic connection, engaging companionship, and a feeling of belonging with each other as though we both won an AGT Golden Buzzer for true love.

I live alone in a nice house, and a few things I enjoy are movies & TV shows, gaming (boardgames, card games, chess, video games), crafting & DIY projects, and cruising in my Star Trek themed Corvette. I’ll also love candlelit dinners prepared by me for you …or by us together with flirty mischief, kisses, and soft jazz music. I’ve chosen a healthy lifestyle with no smoking, no drinking, no coffee, and an intermittent-fasting vegetarian diet (except for a few seafoods).

Some of my favorite music artists include Depeche Mode, The Cure, The Smiths, Enya, KISS (with makeup), INXS, 12 Girls Band, and composers such as John Williams, Hans Zimmer, and John Barry. Fashion is important to me when going out, and my style changes with my mood (and the weather) - sometimes ""goth"" studded faux leather, sometimes Asian-inspired silks, other times just casual t-shirt & shorts in summer or cozy sweats (at home only) in winter.

My passions include sci-fi (especially classic Star Trek, and it’s okay if you’ve never watched it - you can discover it together with me), Asian style (as seen in my wardrobe and home decor), model kits (honestly, I’ve got far too many), intimate moments with someone special, and looking forward to sewing authentic Star Trek uniforms with a creative partner.

I’m seeking a sweet, young, affectionate, feminine “girlie” woman who prefers wearing dresses & skirts, has long-ish hair length (up top only…), naturally pretty and smooth complexion without needing makeup, and soft fragrance because as a deep Scorpio I’m very sensitive to scents. Regarding astrology, I’m supposedly most compatible with Pisces, Cancer, Capricorn, Taurus, or Virgo (and Scorpio could work also).

You should be female since birth, petite/slim, honest, faithful, caring, ethical, non-religious, and frequently “in the mood”. Bonus points if you’re clingy and love hand-holding, hugs & cuddles, spooning, stealing kisses in public, artistic hobbies, holiday decorating, snuggling on a couch binge-watching movies & TV shows, gaming, and occasional weekend getaways. You should be serious about wanting a committed relationship based on mutual attraction, shared interests, and genuine respect for each other.

My dealbreakers: Must be at least 18 yrs old, no smoking (includes vaping), no alcohol (includes wine), no coffee, already or willing to be meat-free (except some seafoods), no tattoos at all, no piercings (except maybe earlobes), no kids, no pets, and no circus clowns. (Are you still reading after everyone else has left? Okay, I'm more impressed than Darth Vader seeing Luke's acrobatics...)

If this all seems “too picky”, well I’m quite self-aware and very much know what I want and don’t want with a companion, just the same as you probably having your own personal preferences. And consider this: if we’re both picky and we chose each other, then that right there gives an indication of our compatibility.

I believe in-person dating is crucial for two people to truly get to know each other, but I’m open to temporary long-distance if we’re a good match. This guy has his life in order, and just missing a sweetheart to cherish days and nights with. If any of this has struck a chord with you, contact me and let's turn that chord into a melody.

I’ve been thinking about the softer side of remote and hybrid work. Tools like Slack/Zoom handle tasks well, but when it comes to feeling *connected as humans*, I feel like there’s a gap.

For example:  
– Birthdays/anniversaries get skipped or feel awkward  
– Recognition often disappears into private chats instead of being visible  
– New hires miss the fun/random side of joining a team  
– “Team rituals” (coffee chats, happy hours) sometimes feel forced

I’m curious:  
– If you work remote, what actually makes you feel like you *belong*?  
– What has your company tried that flopped?  
– What’s one idea you wish existed to make remote culture feel less… sterile?

I purchased a coffee table in July, the beginning of July. Me and my fiance didn't end up needing it, and decided to return it for a refund.

The package was unopened, and we followed the instructions (printing the label, etc) and sent it out.

A while back, I could track the package and saw it went back to it's location (somewhere in Poland) (I'm in Germany)

I screenshotted this, but Amazon itself still hasn't updated the option of the return to state that it's been ""returned"".

Nothing about refund pending.

It's almost September, and still no refund, and I'm starting to get increasingly frustrated. 

I tried to contact support, but there's no human to talk to, and since the return process is stuck at ""return has been approved"" there's no option to ask about refund, because Amazon is still waiting for the return.

I've contacted the seller, they made me fill out a document prior, but since then? Nothing, no response from them.

I don't know what to do now, if I wasn't gonna get a refund, I'd have just kept the table, so what now I bought something for nothing?

What do I do? Can I even contact a person?

I've refunded things before and never had issues, but this was a bit of an expensive table, so I'd hate to be at this loss.

And yet, I honestly didn't hate any of my reads today – sometimes the math just doesn't math unfortunately. 

**For those of you that are new here,** I try to do a post-game recap both when we win *and* when we lose... while it's always nice to win together, sometimes it helps to sulk and commiserate together as well. Tonight, we'll be doing the latter 😂🥵 

Funny – **after the Detroit Tigers game ended,** someone in our community sent me a message and asked if losing bothers me. I'm going to be wildly candid about this: the short answer, is no. A loss day doesn't bother me, a losing week doesn't bother me, and hell, even the odd losing month doesn't bother me. Though, the reason losses in the short-term don't bother me is because I know that in the grand scheme, these losses are minimal. 

Let me put this into perspective for you, friends – and let's use baseball as an example because that's what's giving us grief at the moment. **The MLB season is long; bettors literally have 162 games to turn a profit!** And over the course of the year – *an entire year* of major league sports – a bad month is peanuts (assuming you're sticking to your unit sizes!)  

So for those of you that are feeling down and/or discouraged because of a rough stretch, don't be. There will be plenty of opportunities to get your bankroll groove back, so to speak. **Fun fact:** we quite *literally* always recover 😉

On that note, I'm off to plan my revenge on sports book for today's casualties. 

I'll see you all bright and early to conquer the books!

It's not a sure thing, but we have some things to be encouraged about. July was really a drought for flaring. Only 3 days saw M-Class flares. August has had 16 days with at least one M1-M4.56 flare. Not much in the way of earth directed activity though although those eastern and far side eruptions sent some MeV protons our way despite being in one of the least favorable locations to do so. We briefly crossed into S1 Radiation Storm levels and 10 MeV protons remain very close to S1 levels and should slowly taper off based on current conditions.

The active regions associated with the explosive flaring and CME activity of the past week are finally rotating into full view. I am writing this late Monday night but by tomorrow morning I expect we will have a pretty good view of most of the regions. Sunspot number is rebounding nicely and the F10.7 is back into the high range at 175 after a 23 unit jump in the last 24 hours. The X-Ray flux began ramping up on 8/22 with modest but steady increase in background and flaring.

AR4191 has grown over its journey and displayed some nice inter-polarity mixing over the 24th but has taken a small step back in complexity since, but retains beta-gamma status. Despite all this, it is yet to produce an M-Class flare while on our half of the sun. We have a pretty good look at the AR4197 complex and it continues to evolve with some strong development since appearing. Not much flaring happening there either though. The rowdiest of the bunch to this point is AR4199 located near the incoming equator with 8 C-Class and 4 M-Class flares since 8/25, including the M4.56 and in recent hours an M3.4. 

Here is the sunspot emergence and development on the incoming limb. The leading region is 4191 and the trailing region on the same latitude just cresting the limb is 4199. The 4195-4197 complex is in the southern hemisphere.

Encouraging right? Well, it's better than the solar boredom of late. Sometimes the sun has looked more minimum than maximum with a near spotless appearance last week. There is an eruptive pattern in place and I am not sure if it is going to break. All the flaring seems to be confined to the eastern hemisphere of the sun and most of it directly at the limb or behind it. The earth facing portion and the departing western limb have remained mostly quiet. 

Take a look at the sun in 131A since 8/18 and you will see what I mean.

https://reddit.com/link/1n0drgd/video/uf8ma2nyfalf1/player

Everything exciting has been confined to the E limb. You are probably thinking ""but the regions responsible have now rotating to face us!"" This is true and hopefully we see a break in the pattern but even as flaring regions have rotated into view, it hasn't translated into much just yet. We also have to keep in mind that there was significant plasma filament and prominence activity involved with the eruptions last week. It may not have all been driven by active regions and associated flaring. I want to see some more central longitude action before getting too excited.

One other thing sticks out. The beautiful signatures of the flares which have occurred. Part of the reason they look so magnificent is because they are against the backdrop of space on the limb but there have been some unique signatures. I posted a clip of an M1 which got the party started last week because of how it stood out compared to most flares of similar magnitude. The post flare arcades have been stunning as well. Next I am going to show you the same timeline in 193A. 

https://reddit.com/link/1n0drgd/video/s8a6lm27half1/player

When the big far side eruption occurs the entire solar corona appears to pulse. You can see a wicked plasma tornado on the NW appearing darker than its surroundings as well as the big filament snap in the SW. 

The hype is building regardless and I do hope that we get some excitement but I am hedging just a bit. I would like to see more activity and more sunspot development by these regions as they near the central meridian. The stage is set for it. We got lights and we got camera, just waiting for the action here at earth. I will be watching over the coming days. 

I haven't been able to post much the past several weeks due to a ridiculous schedule and demands for time. I hope that looks to be leveling off as the household adjusts to big routine changes with back to school and afterschool activities and the wife's new job at a hospital. I have been working 6 days a week since May and that doesn't look to change any time soon but I will be taking all 3 days this coming holiday weekend and hopefully I have some solar activity to break down to go with the start of college football. Go Buckeyes of course!

**3I/ATLAS - Dirty Snowball, Alien Spacecraft or Electric Comet?**

Comet 3I/ATLAS sure is interesting. It's properties and behavior have elicited everything from perplexity and wonder to reckless speculation. Last week HST estimated the size at no more than 5.6km and likely much smaller. SPHEREx estimates the size at 23 km but stipulates 99% of the perceived mass is from dust scattering. CO2 dominates the spectral analysis. The SPHEREx team says that the lack of water gas coma is puzzling given the observations took place within the 2.5 AU snow line, among other things. Everyone is waiting on the JWST data and I might as well too before going too far into it but I will note that the behavior of this comet has thus far been a very interesting case study for comparison of the dirty snowball model and electric comet model and I am keeping notes. I couldn't be more excited about it. While the debate in public discourse is framed between unusual comet and alien space ship, 99% of people have no idea there is another option which may end up fitting better than both. 

I asked ChatGPT to run a brief analysis on the SPHEREx results. You may find it interesting. You will have to excuse the prompt. I was having trouble uploading the PDF and had to copy and paste the entire paper into it. My commands and parameters are at the bottom. And do keep in mind that I am not here to argue over validity. Who is right and who is wrong is beyond me. I like to understand competing and what I consider credible ideas. Many will dismiss this out of hand, but they will have to do so knowing that no ice is yet to be detected on or in a comet and that there is a perfectly reasonable and recently confirmed mechanism to explain the water vapor we detect and assume is from ice sublimating due to sunlight. If you want to understand the dilemma in comet science better, search comet on this sub and check out the Thunderbolts Project YT page on comets. To get into all the details in this post is beyond the scope of its purpose but I have done so many times on this sub.

And after all, as part of my electric comet observations, I may be the first person to have documented a solar coronal streamer interaction with a comet back in January when G3 ATLAS made perihelion. Something that should not possible be if comets are a a few km sized tiny ice balls sublimating into space. I say may be the first because one cannot rule out coincidence. It's not a sure thing, but you can take a look and see what your own eyes tell you. Watch for the wispy coronal streamers to gently follow the comet at its apex. It's subtle but I was looking for an interaction based on that comet's orbital path around the sun and was not disappointed.

In other electrical astrophysical  developments, I leave you with this article.

[Braided magnetic flux ropes found at both human and light year scales](https://phys.org/news/2025-08-braided-magnetic-flux-ropes-human.html#google_vignette)

*Magnetic flux ropes occur in a variety of situations ranging from the human scale—say, a laboratory experiment—to the absolutely huge: solar flares that are few hundred thousand kilometers long. Astrophysical structures with magnetic flux ropes can also span hundreds or even thousands of light-years.*

*""One of the most exciting aspects of this research is that magnetohydrodynamics, the theory of magnetized plasmas, turns out to be fantastically scalable. When I first started looking into this, I thought the phenomena of magnetic structures at different scales were qualitatively similar, but because their sizes are so different, they couldn't be described by the same equations. It turns out that this is not so. What we see in lab experiments and in solar and astrophysical observations are governed by the same equations.""*

Just a reminder that magnetic fields and the electric currents which are associated with them are integral and foundational in the cosmos. Far from inert, frozen, residual, or side effect, they are important and there is indeed a scalability to plasma from the lab to light years. Much of what we are ""discovering"" now was theorized to be foundational a century ago by Birkeland, Alfven, Langmuir, and others, and often met with scorn. If looking into electric comets makes me pseudoscientific then I guess I am in damn good company. 

It's 1:30 AM and as I close this, another M4.5 just fired off and it's not on the limb. It's at the 4197 complex and it's got a beautiful early signature. I think on that note I will call it a night. Encouraging to see a nice flare closer to a longitude that matters for earth directed activity. Let's hope for some fireworks in the coming days.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to maximizing space and functionality, a barndominium garage with a loft is an exceptional choice. These unique structures blend the charm of rustic living with modern convenience, presenting an innovative solution for homeowners looking to combine their living and working spaces.

Barndominiums are known for their open floor plans, and integrating a garage with a loft takes this to the next level. Not only does it provide ample storage and workspace, but it also allows for creative uses of upper-level areas. Here are some features that make these designs stand out:

- **Spacious Loft Areas:** The loft floor can be used for various purposes, from extra storage to a cozy office or even a guest room. This maximizes the utility of vertical space.
- **Natural Light:** With strategically placed windows and skylights, the garage area can be filled with natural light, making it a pleasant place to work.
- **Versatile Interior Layout:** The open-concept design allows you to customize your space to meet your needs, whether you require a workshop, gym, or hobby area.
- **Energy Efficiency:** Modern barndominium designs often include energy-efficient materials and techniques, reducing overall utility costs.

When designing your barndominium garage with a loft, it's essential to consider the layout carefully. Here are some advanced strategies you should keep in mind:

- **Access Points:** Make sure you design the loft's entry point conveniently located. Consider using a staircase or a pull-down ladder that suits your space and lifestyle.
- **Storage Solutions:** Incorporate built-in shelves, cabinets, or overhead racks to make use of the often-underutilized space. Smart storage helps keep the garage organized and functional.
- **Work Zones:** If your garage also serves as a workspace, designate specific areas for different tasks. This zoning can improve your efficiency when working on projects.
- **Utilities:** Plan for electrical and plumbing requirements in your garage. This can be particularly useful if you want to use the loft space for hobbies that require power tools or water access.

Another great advantage of a barndominium garage with a loft is the possibility of incorporating outdoor elements. An adjoining patio or deck can enhance your living space significantly. Imagine enjoying a morning coffee on a deck overlooking your property while being surrounded by the open countryside.

The aesthetic appeal of a barndominium also plays a crucial role in its popularity. With metal siding and wooden accents, these garages can maintain a rustic charm while offering contemporary features. You can choose from various exterior finishes to match your style, whether modern or traditional.

For those considering a barndominium with a loft, it's essential to think beyond design. Here are a few questions to ask yourself during the planning process:

- What will be the primary use of the garage? (Storage, workspace, etc.)
- How much weight can the loft support? (This will determine its use)
- What materials are you considering for both durability and aesthetics?
- What are your local zoning and building regulations?

With the right garage with a loft floor plan, the possibilities are nearly endless. You can create a professional workspace at home while keeping your living area separate. For example, if you run a small business, having an area for inventory or equipment in your garage means you can work efficiently without disrupting your personal space.

Ultimately, a barndominium garage with a loft is more than just a functional structure. It’s an opportunity to embrace a lifestyle that values space, functionality, and creativity. By carefully considering your needs and preferences, you can design a barndominium that not only meets your practical demands but also reflects your unique personality.

This modern approach to living is quickly becoming a favorite among homeowners looking for clever and stylish ways to utilize their property. Whether you’re building a new barndominium or remodeling an existing garage, adding a loft is a project that promises to enhance your lifestyle and living experience.

The Benefits of Choosing a Barndominium Garage with Loft: A Practical Guide for Homeowners
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Choosing a barndominium garage with a loft can be an exciting and practical decision for many homeowners.

Here are some of the key benefits of opting for a barndominium garage with a loft.

### Maximized Space Utility

One of the most significant advantages of a barndominium garage with a loft is the efficient use of space. The loft area can serve multiple purposes, such as:

- **Extra Storage:** Store seasonal items, tools, and equipment without cluttering your main living areas.
- **Home Office:** Set up a quiet workspace separate from the main house.
- **Guest Quarters:** Use the loft as a cozy space for visitors.

This extra floor space maximizes the garage's utility, making it more than just a place to park your vehicles.

### Cost-Effective Building Solution

When you compare the costs of building a traditional garage with separate living spaces, a barndominium garage with a loft is often more affordable. Combining living and utility spaces in one structure can save you both time and money. The materials used in barndominiums, typically metal and wood, are often less expensive than more conventional materials.

### Design Flexibility

Barndominiums offer incredible design flexibility. Homeowners can customize the interior and exterior according to their taste and needs. Whether you prefer a rustic look with exposed beams or a modern aesthetic with sleek lines, the options are endless. You can also choose different roof styles, colors, and finishes to make your barndominium garage truly unique.

### Energy Efficiency

Energy efficiency is another important factor that attracts many homeowners to barndominiums. These structures can be built with insulation that keeps the internal environment comfortable year-round. With the right windows and doors, you can also maximize natural light while minimizing energy costs.

### Quick Construction Time

Building a barndominium garage with a loft can be significantly faster than constructing a traditional home. Many of the components are pre-fabricated, allowing for quicker assembly on-site. This means you can benefit from your new space sooner. For a busy homeowner, this can alleviate stress and provide a solution in less time.

### Strong and Durable

Barndominiums are built to last. The materials used in construction are durable and weather-resistant. A metal exterior can withstand harsh conditions, from heavy snowfall to extreme heat, providing peace of mind for homeowners. This durability means that fewer repairs and maintenance will be required over the lifespan of your barndominium garage.

### Potential for Increased Property Value

Investing in a barndominium with a garage and loft can increase the overall value of your property. This is particularly true in rural areas where these structures are increasingly popular. A well-designed barndominium can attract potential buyers, serving as both a functional living space and an attractive centerpiece on your property.

### Aesthetic Appeal

The unique design of barndominiums makes them visually appealing. The rustic charm of a barn combined with modern features creates a cozy environment that feels both welcoming and functional. Whether you’re hosting a party or just relaxing at home, a barndominium garage with a loft can be a beautiful backdrop.

### Community and Culture

Barndominiums often appeal to those who appreciate a rural lifestyle. This construction style fosters a sense of community, allowing you to connect with like-minded neighbors who also value open spaces and practical living solutions. Sharing ideas and experiences with other barndominium owners can enrich your living experience.

Ultimately, a barndominium garage with a loft offers endless possibilities. From practicality to aesthetic appeal, the benefits of this innovative structure are numerous. Whether you're considering building a new home or simply expanding your garage, a barndominium may be the ideal choice for you.

### Conclusion

Choosing a barndominium garage with loft floor plans can dramatically transform the way you utilize space on your property. These innovative designs seamlessly blend functionality with aesthetics, allowing homeowners to maximize every square foot. With a loft, you can create additional storage, an office, or even a cozy retreat, all while keeping your main garage area uncluttered and efficient.

Beyond the clever use of space, there are numerous benefits to selecting a barndominium garage with a loft. This approach not only enhances your home's value but also provides lasting benefits for your daily lifestyle. Whether you are a DIY enthusiast, an avid car collector, or someone who needs a workshop, the versatility of a loft space adapts to your individual needs. Plus, building it all under one roof means you capitalize on convenience without sacrificing style.

By investing in a barndominium garage with loft floor plans, you are embracing a modern living solution that prioritizes both practicality and character. With customizable options available, you can personalize your space to reflect your unique taste and lifestyle requirements. This type of structure meets the needs of today’s homeowners, making smart use of resources while fostering an inviting atmosphere.

Ultimately, a barndominium garage with an upper level is more than just a storage solution; it represents a lifestyle choice that harmonizes comfort, convenience, and creativity.

Not just when it comes to deals or pricing, we avoid any conversation. No coffee. No calls. No “are you seeing this trend too?” chats. It is almost built into our reflex.   
  
We have grown up with the idea that protecting information is the same as protecting advantage. That silence means safety. But in SaaS, the real advantage is not what you know, it is how fast you adapt.   
  
Here is the thing. Some of the fastest and most actionable signals you will ever get come from people solving the same problems you are. Often, these are your competitors.   
  
When we do not talk to them: • We make the same mistakes in parallel. • We react late to platform, API, or compliance changes that hit everyone. • We miss chances to shape the category narrative together, which slows adoption.

I am not talking about sharing customer lists or sales playbooks.   
  
I am talking about safe, high-level exchanges on: • Macro shifts in buyer behaviour. • New integration or ecosystem risks. • Early read on regulatory or tax changes. • Platform roadmap changes that could impact multiple players.   
  
These are not secrets. They are market signals. The more we trade them, the faster we move.   
  
The reason we do not do it is not a matter of strategy.   
  
It is behaviour. We have been conditioned to treat competitors as threats to be ignored, not as sources of insight to be filtered and used.  
  
If Indian SaaS wants to play at the top global level, we need to unlearn that reflex. We need more conversations, not fewer.

I can barely contain my excitement lately thinking about no code automation and the way it's upending everything about *how* we work. Just a few years ago, automating even simple workflows required weeks of learning, frustrating debugging, and tons of code. Now? You can build crazy useful solutions with just a few clicks and creative thinking!

Let’s talk:

- The biggest blocks to innovation were always about technical know-how. But no code is like giving everyone superpowers—whether you’re in HR, marketing, customer support, or on the warehouse floor, you can literally automate your own problems away!
- Tools like Zapier, Make, and all these up-and-coming AI triggermen are taking things to a wild new level.
- Open up an app, point, click, drag, drop. You’re GOOD! Build that lead tracker, auto-archive your emails, publish reports, jiggle data between platforms that would never talk to each other. If you can imagine it, you can probably automate it.

What absolutely thrills me is the democratization aspect.

- Suddenly grandma can schedule her newsletters, teens can spin up drip campaigns for their dog-walking biz, and exhausted remote workers can reclaim hours from mindless tasks.
- There’s *zero* gatekeeping; everyone’s invited to this new playground.

**But:**  
It’s not just about time savings or cost savings, as wonderful as both are.

No code automation lets you move so FAST. You can prototype in a coffee break. Want to change your workflow? Adjust a flow in minutes! Found a new tool to add? Plug it in, run, done.

Here’s why it’s seriously game-changing:

- You become the architect of your own efficiency.
- It’s so satisfying watching your workflow hum along in the background. Sometimes I even giggle when I see posts magically surface right when I need them.
- Collaboration across skills and teams has never come this easy.

Of course, there are still challenges—sometimes connections break, or you outgrow a tool’s flexibility, and yes, knowing *when* to automate (and when not to!) is an art in itself. But with this much power just waiting to be explored, learning and sharing are half the fun.

So, what do YOU want to automate?  
What’s the wildest or most unexpectedly delightful no code flow you’ve created?

Let’s drop our favorite tools, mindblowing stories, lingering frustrations, and pie-in-the-sky ideas! This isn’t just a movement, it’s a revolution—and it’s awesome to build it together! 🎉",1,1756186137.0,GPTAppsEngine,0,1.0,False

Okay guys, story time because I seriously need to know if I’m just losing it or if there’s actually something going on here...""
So my little sister (she’s 20) brings most of her friends over to my house, which I don’t mind at all—I'm the eldest (27), and I’ve always kinda been the big sibling that looks out for everyone. I welcome all her friends with open arms.
But there’s this one guy—let’s call him E.
At first, I didn’t pay him any mind. He was just part of the crowd, you know? But over time, there were these little moments—and now I’m sitting here wondering... am I reading into this or is he actually trying to flirt?
Like:
“Let me drive you to work.”
“Can I come over and watch a movie?”
“Any request—if it’s from you—I’ll take it.”
“Wanna go on a road trip with me?”
“Can I bring Copper (his dog) over?”
Now don’t get me wrong—we chat pretty regularly on Instagram, but it’s never overly flirty. Just... steady. Friendly. But warm.
There was this one time I messaged him saying, “Where’s Copper? I miss him, I wanna hug and kiss him.”
And he goes, “He’s busy, I can take over for him.”
Ummm... 👀
Then, out of nowhere, he says he needs to get away—something about being pissed off at home—and invites me on this spontaneous road trip. We went, got coffee, and just sat in the car for hours talking. Like, full-on heart-to-heart vibes. My heart did a little somersault, not gonna lie.
And get this—when we got back, I jokingly brought up that whole “you said you’d take over for Copper” thing and teased him about not hugging me in the car. He goes, “Well, you didn’t ask.”
So I’m like, “I was shy, I didn’t know if you’d want to.”
And then he hit me with:
“I would’ve liked it.”
Like. WHAT.
But then when he’s with the friend group? He’s super chill with my sister. I’ve noticed he leans in when they talk, they laugh a lot, and apparently they even know each other’s phone passwords?? So naturally, my suspicious self had to ask...
“Do you like my sister?”
He flat-out said no.
So now I’m stuck here in this weird emotional limbo. The moments we’ve shared feel real—personal even—but then the mixed signals are making me question everything.
Is he being flirty and emotionally open with me… or am I just misreading a really friendly guy?
Help.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Newcastle vs. Liverpool: A Clash of Titans (or Tired Turtles?)**

Ah, the Premier League’s most *unbalanced* rivalry! Newcastle, the underdog with the heart of a caffeinated hamster, faces Liverpool, the reigning champions who’ve probably already booked their title party venue. Let’s parse the odds, news, and chaos to see who’ll walk away with bragging rights (and maybe a few more points).

---

### 1. Parse the Odds: Who’s the Bookies’ Favorite?

The implied probabilities from the odds (though oddly missing for this specific Newcastle-Liverpool match in your data—thanks, typo?) suggest Liverpool are the clear favorites. For context, if Liverpool were -200 (implied 83% chance), Newcastle’s +400 (20% chance) would make this a lopsided bet. But since we’re working with the Tottenham-Bournemouth odds instead (thanks, data mix-up?), let’s extrapolate: Tottenham’s 1.67 odds imply a 61% win chance, while Bournemouth’s 4.6 odds suggest 18%. But hey, maybe Liverpool’s odds are *worse* than Tottenham’s? Unlikely.

**Key Stats for Newcastle vs. Liverpool**:

* **Newcastle**: 0-0-1 (1 draw, 0 wins) so far, missing Isak, Willock, and Hall. Their attack? A leaky sieve.
* **Liverpool**: 1-1 (win vs. Bournemouth, loss in the Community Shield). Still have Gakpo, Salah, and Mac Allister—though Frimpong’s out.
* **Historical Context**: Liverpool has won 12 of the last 15 meetings. Newcastle’s last win? 2019, when time was on our side and Ronaldo was still in Portugal.

---

### 2. Digest the News: Injuries, Comebacks, and Chaos

**Newcastle’s News**:

* Alexander Isak, their Swedish striker, is out. Imagine a bakery without bread—still open, but the menu’s sad.
* Joe Willock and Lewis Hall are also sidelined. Newcastle’s midfield? A group of accountants fumbling for a coffee machine.

**Liverpool’s News**:

* Jeremie Frimpong is out until

At a 24-hour bookstore in Shenzhen, Lu Da, frustrated in his job search, rekindles his fighting spirit amid the aroma of coffee and books deep into the night, eventually knocking on the door of opportunity. In the commercial buildings of Huaqiangbei, former opera star Sister Fan sheds her costume to become the “Deal-making Queen,” carving out a new world in the arena of electronic products.

Delivery rider Tan Xiaohe, known as the “Queen of Orders,” embodies professional dignity through her work. Drone engineer Zhang Yi and Nuannuan weave a love story through lines of code. A forest encounter between the lost youth Xiaopeng and a stray civet cat inspires the creation of the country’s first wildlife overpass. Planner Wang Pengqian and his daughter spend a decade guarding the mangroves, witnessing the [black-faced spoonbill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-faced_spoonbill) Y075 become a living symbol of ecological transformation.

Just a guy who misses and looking for a girl that is fine with a casual intimacy. A girl who misses being touch, getting dominated, and getting babied in bed. A someone fine with being casual and not ready to commit in relationship. 

A someone that is not too aggressive, just a normal or soft girl that wants to be submissive. A girl that is open for giving blowjobs and hanjobs.

I'm open for inexperienced girls that wants to try getting eaten, fingers, or getting a dick inside you.

It could be a one time thing or a long term casual intimacy. Pero it's much nicer if it's long term.

I am on a scholarship and started right after high school. I have good grades, and am semi-involved. I will be applying to UofT GPLLM in the fall and hopefully get in. I have interned at a medium-large firm in Toronto for the past two summers. I do not feel like I have a chance at getting an articling position with them (I got this out of chance) (but have gotten some really great experience). 

Looking into the future, if i get into UofT:

* How to go about ""coffee chats""? 
   * How do I even go about trying to get them?
   * Will they help me with getting an articlingship?
* What steps do I need to take to make myself an attractive candidate as a llb graduate?

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Eva Lys vs. Francesca Jones: A Battle of Grit, Genetics, and Glorious Gimmicks**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a Grand Slam showdown that reads like a Marvel movie pitch: *Superhuman Resilience: The Eva Lys Chronicles vs. The Unbreakable Francesca Jones*. This isn’t just tennis—it’s a medical marvel, a genetic anomaly, and a lesson in defying the odds, all rolled into one. Let’s break it down.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Who’s the Bookmakers’ Favorite?

The numbers tell a story of cautious confidence. Eva Lys, ranked 59th, is the slight favorite across the board, with decimal odds hovering around **1.65** (implying a \~60% implied probability of victory). Francesca Jones, the 89th-ranked Brit, sits at **2.2** (roughly 45% implied probability). Translating this into human terms: bookmakers think Lys is the more reliable pick, but they’re not *convinced* she’ll win. It’s the tennis equivalent of ordering a “medium” coffee—safe, but not exactly bold.

The spread and total lines add nuance. Lys is favored by 2.5 games, with the total games line set at 21.5. This suggests expectations of a tight, competitive match—neither player is being written off, which bodes well for an entertaining clash.

---

### Digesting the News: Health, History, and Heroism

**Eva Lys** is a medical marvel. Competing with a rheumatic autoimmune disease that forces her to weigh every match as a potential health gamble, she’s a real-life “I, Robot” protagonist. Her recent decision to skip a Cleveland quarter-final to protect her joints? A masterclass in long-term planning. “Gesundheit comes first,” as she’d say. Lys’ nickname, “Lucky Lys,” stems from her 2023 Australian Open run as a lucky loser—a twist that makes her current campaign feel like a sequel with higher stakes.

**Francesca Jones**, meanwhile, is a genetic outlier. Born with ectrodactyly ectodermal dysplasia (EED)—three fingers and a thumb on each hand, seven toes total—she’s a testament to the power of “never let a doctor’s doubt stop your dream.” Doctors said tennis was impossible? Jones said, “Watch me.” She’s coming off back-to-back WTA 125 titles, dropping a set in the process, which is like a rookie driver wi

Hi there,

I am a 33 year old guy from Michigan and I am hoping to meet someone genuine to connect with. I am open to friendship, dating, or just seeing where things naturally go. I am laid back, friendly, and always up for a good laugh. When the weather is nice you will usually find me outside camping, hiking, or spending time by the water. During the colder months I am all about staying in with coffee, a good book, or binging a series.

A little about me. I am 5’10 with an athletic build, green eyes, and brown hair. I do not smoke, and I drink socially. I try to live an active lifestyle and enjoy keeping busy but I also know how to slow down and enjoy the quiet moments.

What I am looking for is someone who is down to earth, fun to talk to, and open to building a steady connection without games or drama. I am very open minded when it comes to age and body type because I believe trust, communication, and a solid mental connection are what matter most.

I think life is better when you have someone to share it with, whether that means grabbing coffee, going for a walk, sharing stories, or even something more if the connection is right. If you are someone who values laughter, honesty, and just enjoying the simple things, I would love to get to know you.

*By \[Your Name\], The Sportswriter Who Still Can’t Serve a Proper Forehand*

---

**Parsing the Odds: The Math of Mayhem**  
Let’s start with the numbers, because even in tennis, *someone* has to make sense. Danielle Collins (-3.5 to -4 set spread) is the prohibitive favorite here, with decimal odds hovering around **1.36-1.40**, translating to an implied probability of **73-74%** to win. Jaqueline Cristian, meanwhile, sits at **2.90-3.28**, implying a **30-34%** chance. That’s the statistical equivalent of me believing I can finally master a proper first serve—unlikely, but not impossible if the ball spontaneously combusts mid-air.

The total games line is **21.5**, with even money on Over/Under. Given Collins’ power game and Cristian’s tendency to fluctuate between “dominant” and “mystery meat,” expect a match that’s either a clinic in efficiency or a third-set thriller.

---

**Digesting the News: Injuries, Comebacks, and Mixed Baggage**  
Danielle Collins, the “veteran” (read: someone who retired and came back like it was a weekend errand), has a resume that includes a 2023 Wimbledon semifinal and a post-retirement “*I’ve been training with a personal coach who’s also a life coach*” vibe. Her return from retirement? Smooth as a freshly pressed dress on the red carpet. Recent form? A 5-2 W/L record, which is about as consistent as my morning coffee routine.

Jaqueline Cristian, on the other hand, is a mixed bag of “what if?” She’s 24, with a 12-10 season record, and has the kind of game that makes you think, *“Oh, she’s having an off-day… or is she just here for the free snacks?”* No major injuries reported, but her results this year are like a tennis-themed Russian nesting doll—open one layer, and you find another

The scent of lilies filled the house.  
  
It was a smell Karissa Simon had grown to hate. It clung to the curtains, the furniture, her clothes. It was the smell of Hettie Lindsey.  
  
Brady Kennedy walked into the living room, his phone pressed to his ear. He didn't look at Karissa. He never did, not really.  
  
Yes, of course, they're your favorite, he was saying, his voice low and soft, a tone he never used with her. ""The whole house will be full of them.""  
  
Karissa felt her throat tighten. An old, familiar allergy, or maybe something else.  
  
For four years, this house had been her gilded cage. Their marriage was a business merger, a cold transaction designed to save his family's pride and chain her to a man who despised her. She was a ghost here, haunting the grand staircase.  
  
He hung up the phone. The silence that followed was colder than his voice had been.  
  
I need you to sign these, Brady said. He tossed a manila folder onto the marble coffee table. It slid across the polished surface and stopped just at the edge.  
  
Divorce Papers.  
  
The words were printed in stark, black ink at the top of the page.  
  
Karissa stared at them. She'd known this was coming. Ever since Hettie, his childhood sweetheart, had resurfaced two months ago, this moment had been hanging over them, a guillotine waiting to fall.  
  
You got what you wanted, Karissa, he said, his voice flat. ""Your family used this marriage to crush the Kennedys. Now, I'm taking back what's mine. The Simon Group will be my compensation.""  
  
She remembered a different Brady, a boy from her childhood, her brother's best friend, who promised to protect her always. That memory was the foundation of a love so deep it had become her life's sickness.  
  
I won't sign, she said, her voice barely a wh\*\*per.  
  
He finally looked at her. His eyes, the color of a stormy sea, were filled with a familiar, chilling contempt.  
  
Don't be pathetic. Hettie is back. She's carrying my child.  
  
Each word was a hammer blow.  
  
Karissa's hand went to her stomach. A desperate, foolish plan had formed in her mind over the last few sleepless nights. A last-ditch lie.  
  
I'm pr\*\*nant too, Brady.  
  
He laughed. It was a short, ugly sound.  
  
Do you think I'm a fool? We haven't shared a bed in three years. Stop this disgusting charade. You've always been a liar.  
  
He picked up a vase of the freshly delivered lilies, inhaling their scent deeply, a smile touching his lips for the first time that evening. It was a smile for another woman.  
  
That was the moment something inside her finally broke. The last thread of hope she had been clinging to for four years, for her entire life, snapped.  
  
The pain in her ch\*\*t was sharp, a physical ache the doctors had warned her about. She knew she didn't have much time left.  
  
But he would never know that.  
  
She would not be his burden. She would not be the reason he was pitied, the widower of a woman he never loved.  
  
If he wanted freedom, she would give it to him.  
  
All of it.  
  
She walked to the table, picked up a pen, and signed her name on the divorce papers. Her hand was steady.  
  
Then she picked up her phone. She scrolled to a number she hadn't called in months. Her lawyer, Darcy Dodson.  
  
Darcy, Karissa said, her voice clear and calm. ""Prepare the paperwork. I'm transferring all of my shares in the Simon Group to Brady Kennedy.""  
  
Karissa, what? Are you insane? After everything he's done?  
  
It's a condition of the divorce, Karissa lied smoothly. ""Just do it. And make it effective immediately.""  
  
She hung up before Darcy could argue.  
  
She looked at Brady. He was staring at her, a flicker of surprise in his cold eyes. He hadn't expected it to be this easy.  
  
She had given him everything. Her love, her youth, her company. And now, her future.  
  
It was the only way to truly set him free. And herself.  
  
  
Chapter 2  No.2  
The next day, Karissa began to erase herself.  
  
She started with the lilies. In thin gloves, she gathered every vase, the cloying, sweet smell a physical assault. She dumped them into the tr\*\*h bins behind the house, white petals bruising against black plastic.  
  
The air inside already felt cleaner.  
  
She moved through the rooms, a silent archivist of a life that was already over. In the master bedroom, she opened the closet. His suits hung on one side, hers on the other. She ran her hand over a silk dress he once said made her look ""acceptable""—the closest he'd ever come to a compliment.  
  
She took her clothes out, folding them neatly and placing them into boxes. Sweaters, dresses, shoes. Each item a ghost of a hope. She sealed the boxes with packing tape, the sound loud in the quiet house. She would have them sent to a charity.  
  
Her jewelry box sat on the dresser. Inside lay the diamond necklace he had been forced to give her on their first anniversary. It was cold and heavy in her palm. She had worn it once, desperate to believe it was a symbol of something real. Now she saw it for what it was: a beautiful, expensive lie. She dropped it back into the box and shut the lid.  
  
The hardest part was the study. This was his space, but she had spent countless nights in here, long after he had gone to bed, secretly working. Using her knowledge of her father's company, the Simon Group, to help him navigate its treacherous internal politics. She had leaked information, guided his strategies, all to help him achieve his goal of taking it over, of getting his revenge. He thought he was fighting her family. He never knew she was his most vital, secret ally.  
  
On the desk was a framed photo. It wasn't of them. It was of Hettie, smiling brightly. Brady must have put it there this morning.  
  
Karissa picked it up. She looked at the woman who had won. The woman who would now have everything. The man, the company, the future.  
  
Her fingers tightened around the frame. For a moment, she wanted to smash it. To see the glass shatter into a thousand pieces.  
  
But she didn't. That was the old Karissa. The one who fought, who hoped, who hurt.  
  
The new Karissa simply put the photo back down, exactly where she had found it.  
  
She heard the front door open. Brady was home early.  
  
He walked into the study, stopping short when he saw the boxes.  
  
What is this?  
  
I'm moving my things out, she said. ""I'll be gone by tomorrow.""  
  
He nodded, his expression unreadable. ""Good.""  
  
He walked over to the minibar and poured himself a whiskey. He glanced at the empty space on the wall where a painting she loved used to hang. He didn't seem to notice it was gone. He didn't notice any of the spaces she had cleared.  
  
He only noticed what was there. Hettie's photo.  
  
He picked it up, his thumb gently brushing across the glass.  
  
Hettie is coming for dinner tonight, he said, his back to her. ""She's allergic to the perfume you wear. Don't wear it.""  
  
Karissa stared at his back. The perfume. It was a custom blend, a gift from her late mother. The last tangible piece of her she had left.  
  
He had just asked her to erase her mother, too.  
  
Okay, she said. Her voice was a flat, dead thing.  
  
She went upstairs. She took the small, elegant bottle from her vanity. She didn't put it in a box. She walked into the bathroom, opened the cap, and poured the fragrant liquid down the drain.  
  
The scent filled the small room, rich and floral. A final, fading wh\*\*per of the past.  
  
Then it was gone.  
  
  
Chapter 3  No.3  
The sound of laughter drifted up the stairs.  
  
Hettie's laughter. Light and carefree.  
  
Karissa sat on the edge of the bed in the guest room, surrounded by packed boxes. She had moved in here to give them the master suite. It felt right. She was a guest in this house now, soon to be a stranger.  
  
She could hear their conversation in fragments. Brady's low murmur, Hettie's excited replies. They were talking about the nursery. Blue or yellow? A mural of stars on the ceiling.  
  
Every word was a confirmation of her irrelevance.  
  
She stood up and walked to the door, her body moving on autopilot. She needed a glass of water.  
  
As she reached the bottom of the stairs, she saw them in the living room. Hettie was curled up on the sofa, her head on Brady's lap. He was st\*\*king her hair, his expression softer than Karissa had ever seen it.  
  
They were a perfect picture of domestic bliss. A picture she had only ever dreamed of being in.  
  
Hettie looked up and saw her. A triumphant little smile played on her lips.  
  
Oh, Karissa, she said, her voice dripping with false sweetness. ""I'm so glad you're here. We were just talking about the company.""  
  
Brady's hand stilled on Hettie's hair. He looked at Karissa, his eyes hardening.  
  
Hettie will be taking a position on the board, he announced. It wasn't a suggestion. It was a decree. ""She has some wonderful ideas for the future of the Simon Group.""  
  
It's not the Simon Group anymore, silly, Hettie cooed, tapping his chin. ""It's the Kennedy Corporation now, isn't it?""  
  
Yes, Brady said, his gaze fixed on Karissa. ""It is.""  
  
He was rubbing salt in the wound, making sure she understood her family's name, her legacy, had been wiped away.  
  
I'm sure she'll be a great asset, Karissa said. The words tasted like ash.  
  
Hettie's smile widened. ""I was just telling Brady, I think you stayed on as a consultant for far too long after the merger. It must have been so awkward for you, working for him. People might think you were trying to sabotage things from the inside, you know? Holding on to the past.""  
  
It was a veiled accusation, a poison dart wrapped in concern. She was painting Karissa as a bitter ex-wife, a potential corporate spy. The very thing Karissa had secretly fought against for Brady's sake.  
  
Brady frowned, not at Hettie, but at Karissa.  
  
Hettie has a point, he said, his voice laced with warning. ""It's better for everyone that you're making a clean break. There can be no question of loyalty.""  
  
He was taking Hettie's side. He was questioning Karissa's integrity, her years of silent, thankless work. He was publicly humiliating her, siding with the woman who was a stranger to the company over the woman who had been born to run it.  
  
I understand, Karissa said, her throat raw.  
  
She turned to go back upstairs, but Hettie's voice stopped her.  
  
Brady, darling, she said, her tone full of manufactured innocence. ""My legs are so sore from all the excitement. Would you mind getting me that special herbal tea? The one Callum recommended.""  
  
Callum. Her brother. Her doctor. The only person in the world who knew the truth.  
  
Brady stood up immediately. ""Of course.""  
  
He walked past Karissa into the kitchen without a second glance. Karissa watched him go. He used to make that tea for her. On the rare nights when the pain in her joints was too much to bear, a symptom of her illness she had hidden from him, he would bring it to her. He had called it ""her special brew.""  
  
Now, that small, private gesture of care was being given to another.  
  
From the kitchen, she heard the clink of the ceramic mug, the sound of the kettle boiling. Then, Brady's voice, full of concern. ""Is this hot enough for you, Hettie?""  
  
Karissa turned and walked back up the stairs. She didn't need a glass of water anymore. She felt like she was drowning.  
  
She closed the guest room door and leaned against it, her body trembling.  
  
This was it. The final cut.  
  
She had been a fool to think any part of their life together had been real. It was all a performance, and now the show was over.  
  
She had to leave. Not tomorrow. Tonight.  
  
  
Chapter 4  No.4  
The purge began with his number.  
  
She held her phone, her thumb hovering over the contact. ‘Brady.' It had been at the top of her favorites for a decade. With a final, decisive tap, it was gone. A small, digital amputation.  
  
She moved methodically through her social media, untagging photos, unfollowing his world, dismantling a shared history one click at a time.  
  
A message notification popped up on her screen. It was from Hettie.  
  
A photo.  
  
It was of her hand, intertwined with Brady's. On her finger was a new, obscenely large diamond ring. The caption read: ""He said it's time to make it official. So excited for our future! ❤️""  
  
Karissa stared at the image. There was no pain. No jealousy. Just a vast, empty numbness. She didn't reply. She simply blocked Hettie's number and deleted the conversation.  
  
Her phone buzzed again. This time it was a call. Callum.  
  
Are you okay? he asked, his voice tight with worry. ""I just heard from Darcy. She said you gave him everything.""  
  
I'm fine, Cal, she said, forcing a calm she didn't feel. ""It's for the best.""  
  
The best? Karissa, he's a monster. And that woman… Remember when you were kids? After my parents died and he swore he'd always protect you? He used to call you his 'little guardian angel.' Now look at him.  
  
The memory felt like it belonged to another person. A naive little girl who believed in promises.  
  
That was a long time ago, Karissa said, her voice flat. ""We were kids.""  
  
It meant something to you, Callum said softly. ""Don't lie to me.""  
  
She couldn't argue with that. It had meant everything.  
  
That night, sl\*\*p offered no escape. Just memories. The cruelty wasn't in the constant neglect, but in the sporadic moments of hope. The crumbs of affection he'd dropped, just enough to keep her starving heart alive.  
  
He hadn't just ignored her; he had given her just enough reason to stay, only to destroy the hope later. That was the real torture.  
  
A knock on the door made her jump. It was Brady.  
  
I'm heading out, he said through the door. ""The movers are coming at nine to clear out the rest of this junk. Just leave the key on the counter.""  
  
Junk. That's what her life's possessions were to him.  
  
Okay, she called back.  
  
She heard his footsteps recede down the hall, the front door closing with a definitive click.  
  
That was it. Her final dismissal. He wouldn't even be here to see her go. He was erasing her from his life as easily as she had deleted his number.  
  
It was the final confirmation she needed. There was nothing left to hold on to.

on Saturday i ate:

- red curry panang with jasmine rice (the ones that are frozen you just pop in the microwave)

- pork chop with rice and curry sauce

- while drinking i ate some blueberries

I got black out drunk for the first time in my life, last i remember it was almost 3 am on the sunday, got home safe (thanks to my friends) and i remember puking a lot. gained consciousness at around 07:30, still sunday, where i went to the bathroom and found where all the puke went… everywhere on the floor of the bathroom. 

my first thought, still being drunk, was that i had to clean, but noted the black spots everywhere and wondered why i had them and what i ate that made the black spots. cleaned up the floor and put my clothes in the laundry and started the machine. 

got to bed and woke up around 11:30 and puked again, this time it was only water (had A LOT of water) and those black grounds again… though maybe not as much? i puked and gagged even though i was completely empty and nothing came up after the water.

my stomach did hurt on that sunday, but i didn’t eat anything except 2 dry biscuits and a bowl of popcorn (was scared of puking as i was still nauseous). 

my stomach have been weird, with a faint stabbing pain on the upper right side of my stomach and bloating. constant bloating and the most bloated i have ever had. i also had a VERY painful period, and my period ended on the friday, 2 days prior to me puking. 

it has now been 8-9 days since i puked and i am fine? my stomach is weird, and i have only been pooping once every two days, and they have been hard and did not feel empty completely after but i also have only been eating once a day (dinner) and haven’t had enough water…

my stomach being weird i mean that i still am bloated and my abs are weirdly sore and i still do get that faint stabbing pain.

1n0cy2l,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n0cy2l,"Still in Love's career story: summary, thoughts and theories","After finishing SiLs career story on JP, I just wanted to write and share this so I can process my own thoughts, and hear from other people that have finished her or is interested in her story. It really was unlike anything I've seen or expected from Uma Musume, thing was written like a 2000s visual novel.

Be warned, pretty much everything below is spoilers;)

Story Summary
SiL is character conflicted from within by traits that simply cannot coexist. She is usually quiet, kind, and rational, the kind of person that helps other people without being noticed, And sometimes enjoys drinking coffee together with fellow connnoisseurs like Manhattan Cafe, Rudolph and Dream Journey. But she has a deeply obsessive side as well, and it was her deep love for racing that birthed a second personality. It appears when she is racing with a strong opponent or when she is under a full moon, losing all restraint and laughing and screaming maniacally about 'devouring' her opponents. This understandably creeped out anybody that saw her in this state, making her rational side restrain it so she wouldn't become completely isolated. A battle between instinct and reason is constantly raging inside her, a battle between wanting to express her love and not losing the love she has.
That is why when SiLs trainer called her raw, unfilitered instinctive sprint beautiful, SiL gained a new obsession for her trainer, caring for them to an excessive ammount, like returning to school late at night just to deliver them an umbrella. This new obsession helped her control herself during races, and she was starting to reach an inner peace. After winning the triple tiara, SiL tells trainer that her burning desire for races have dissapeared, and even though its his job to help umas race, the trainer decides to support her. She races one last time in her senior year, and her trainer will follow her wherever she wants to go from there.
But this is when the trainer starts to go insane. SiLs lust for racing had been corrupting (infecting?) them all this time. They are filled with a desire to see her run and starts pressuring SiL to race against their own will. 
In order to please her trainer, SiL decides to resume racing and fully surrenders herself to her obsessive side. She starts corrupting the trainer even further and the trainer's condition rapidly deteriorates, unable to eat or sleep, and drifting in and out of insanity. It is only just in time that SiL is warned of what she's actually doing by Mejiro Ramonu, the first triple tiara winner. This interaction finally lets her two sides reach an equilibrium, her rational side embracing her obsessions as part of her. But at this point its too late for a happy ending, its clear that her presence will continue to corrupt the trainer, and they're both too far gone. Too late to turn back but too broken for a future, They decide to race until the very end. After winning against ramonu in the Japan Cup, the trainer is hospitalized.

This is when the endings diverge.

In the normal ending, the trainer realizes that SiL is trying to leave them for their own good, and escapes the hospital to be with her. SiL is unable to refuse, and they continue to train for races. (They do this at night too, because at this point trainer is like a vampire with glowing red eyes and extremely sensitive to sunlight, Im not making this up.) Its clear this won't last long as literally nothing has improved about their situation, trainer is still insane and SiL will continue to corrupt him.
 
In the 'good' ending, after taking a long break in the hospital the trainer returns to tracen, only to find out that SiL has left school, and almost nobody remembers her. The trainer goes on a 'long journey' (there was a suspicious ammount of emphasis on this journey being VERY long), to find SiL, and eventually, he finds her alone in the middle of a isolated flower field. SiL explains to them that she is 'no longer herself', she can no longer 'go over to your side', and that this time the trainer really is going to break apart. The trainer responds that in that case, they will go over to 'her side' and fulfill the promise they made to be together after they've raced. SiL expresses sadness, saying she wanted to protect her trainer, that she wanted them to be happy. (past tense, huh?) But she admits that her feeling haven't changed, that she's ""still in love"".

Now here's the interesting thing. usually the hot spring event happens before the ending, but in SiLs case it comes after the ending. Meaning that the hot spring event is the sequel to the good ending. In the event, SiL and trainer go to a hot spring together, but everything feels so strange and... all over the place... like a dream. Everything happens during night time, there are no chirping of insects or faint sounds of people talking in the background like other hot spring events, and locations change from one to the next like a blur, all the while the trainer seems to be extremly tired and is dazing in and out of conciousness. Before he completely blacks out, SiL tells them that she has been and always will be happy, and she will always be with him, 'whatever form she may take'.

Thoughts
As much as I like good endings, I fear the 'good' ending is actually a 'merry bad' ending. There are way too many emphasis and clues that the trainer is in a place that is not our physical world, perhaps a place between our world and the afterlife. SiL is almost literally saying that she nor the trainer are no longer human, that the trainer has crossed the last line by meeting her on that flower field.
The hot spring event was a final nail in the coffin that the two cannot be together, because SiL still seems to be corrupting the trainer judging by how tired they were. SiL knows this and seems to have accepted it, sending the trainer back into the real world at the last minute and reminding him that she'll be with him, in a different form.

Theories
I've been thinking about why the heck SiL became such a tragic character in the game, and like always, the answer seems to lie with the irl horse lore. My knowledge of the horse lore is limited, but from what I've learned, I genuinely think Still in Love's real story is a tragedy to rival that of Suzuka or Rice.
First of all, SiL was a 3x3 inbreed of Hail to Reason, meaning she has Hail to reason as a grandparent on both sides of her lineage. This level of inbreeding is frowned on in horse breeding, and can lead to aggressive behaviors. Indeed, in the game SiL frequently attributes her madness to her blood. 
Secondly, it seems like life made it tough for her in general. She made debut alongside Admire Groove, who consistently seemed to outshine her, even as she was on the road to becoming the second triple crown horse since mejiro ramonu. In fact, Admire Groove placed above her in populality polls in all of the triple crown races, even on the very last one when she had beaten her on all past races. Add the fact that horse racing wasn't meeting much attention when she raced, and her career nosediving after winning the crown due to her aforementioned aggressive behaviors, Still in Love ended up becoming a severely underappreciated horse for a triple crown winner. To this day, she is the only one that doesn't have a poster made for her.
Having your shot at gaining glory suddenly taken away like Suzuka or Rice is one thing, but not being given the proper recognition after showing your talents is a different kind of pain. I think this is also where SiLs insane lust for races and love comes from, there's something in her desperate to gain the glory and admiration she couldn't get in her past life.
And then there's her final tragedy... her death. After retiring, she was able to become a breeding horse, but she suddenly passed away at the age of 7 after only giving birth to one foal. This foal didn't perform very well in races and didn't become a breeding horse, so her lineage is gone as well. A stark contrast to Admire Groove, who became a successful breeding horse and gave birth to Duramente, Kitasan Black's rival.

Well...that was dark, it really surprised me because I was under the impression that Uma was all about happy stories. Im just hoping there will be some redemption when Admire Groove's story gets added, there were some good chemistry there too. So um, happy 4.5th anniversary, yaaay! (at least stay gold got to have fun with his kids in the anniversary story)",24,1756184218.0,UmaMusume,10,1.0,False

1n0cwke,https://www.reddit.com/r/MTHFR/comments/1n0cwke/day_1_starting_tawinns_protocol/,"Day 1 - Starting Tawinns ""protocol""","I have been struggling with fatigue, lack of focus and motivation for almost my whole life. I went into this rabbit hole of health after I started drinking coffee and felt better than in years! I could focus, felt motivated and ecstatic. So it got me thinking why I needed caffeine to get me to feel like that and welp, I got to aminoacids, adrenal fatigue, hormone balancing... all these things helped me feel less like sh*t but I still couldn't do without coffee to be fully functional. Yes my mood was more stable and I could handle stress better but I was still far from my best years, which I then remembered I took Solgars V70 multi during those years, could there be a missing nutrient to get me a better metabolism? So I looked into Iron and starting supplementing as it was low, this got me to a point where I could quit coffee and make it through the day while being productive, not my best but good enough. However I would end the day devastated and with no energy to excercise or do anything else. 

So then I went back to potential nutrients that I could be missing and got to choline, many of the symptoms I had left seemed to be related to deficiency of choline or acetylcholine. I started getting deeper into choline supplementation but saw many people got nasty side effects like deep depression, etc... I found the choline calculator and yep, I need plenty of the stuff. I was close buying masterjohns protocol but found Tawinns and here we are. 

Just got the sups today, I took B2 around noon, 2 hrs later I took about 5g of Glycine and 2 hrs after that I took 1200mg of Choline Bitartrate (500mg of choline). So far feeling sharp and energized, I am tired but I could do a quick workout or finish any errands if needed. I also got vit A drops but did not take today. As well I got some inositol just in case I get the depression symptoms

I have used methylfolate before for separate reasons but didn't get much effect neither good or bad, so I am skipping that one. And I did some research into b12 and I feel like that is within range as well (I am considering getting it tested but for now I invested in the other sups). 

I think in my case the issue is choline, I am probably depleted and not getting enough from diet. Will follow up in the following days how this is working for me 

Edit: thought I attached an image but it didn't. I am homozygous C677T and heterozygous SLC19a1. According to the calculator that's an 88% reduction of the MTFHR pathway and it suggests a daily intake of 9 egg yolks worth of choline",3,1756184077.0,MTHFR,1,1.0,False

Chapter 1

As a corporate drone, the person I envied most was the CEO's sister sitting at the desk next to mine.

I worked insane hours for three grand a month while she pulled in three hundred thousand doing absolutely nothing.

She never had to kiss up to idiot clients. Hell, she could throw wine in an investor's face at a company dinner, and her brother would still make me take the fall for it.

But then one day, the Sullivans discovered that Sophie Sullivan wasn't actually blood-related to them.

I was their biological daughter.

My best friend tried to talk me out of going back. ""Girl dads like that will just think you shouldn't exist. They'll never love you. Plus, your brother's totally obsessed with his sister.""

I waved her off. ""We're all adults here. When you get a ticket into old money, who's fighting over love? I just want what's mine.""

If the Sullivans wanted to accept me, great. We'd make it work.

But if they dared give my shares to Sophie, then we'd have problems.

The Sullivans threw me a press conference.

Sophie, who used to sit next to me sipping coffee while dumping her work on me, was sitting in the main seat with red-rimmed eyes.

I found it weird that I, the real daughter being welcomed back, was stuck in the side seat.

Just as I was about to speak up, Sophie suddenly stood and ran off crying.

The moment she bolted, my former boss—now my brother Samuel—along with Edward Sullivan and his wife, all followed her out.

I was left alone on stage with a thousand people staring at me.

I was cringing so hard my toes were curling in my shoes, wondering if I should crack a joke to break the tension, when suddenly voices came through the sound system.

""It's okay, we're just acknowledging her. You're still the Sullivan family's only princess.""

That was Dad's voice.

Then Samuel's. ""Exactly, sweetheart. She's just an employee under me at the end of the day. If she knows her place, I'll humor her and call her sister. But if she tries to take what's yours, I'll kick her out of the company.""

Someone in the crowd muttered, ""Oh shit, they forgot to turn off their mics!""

I rubbed my forehead in disbelief. I'd worked for this moron Samuel for years, and someone as obsessed with PR as he was wouldn't make such a basic mistake.

This was intentional.

He wanted everyone to hear exactly what my position was—a little show of power.

The people who'd been looking at me with envy now had contempt in their eyes.

Chloe's voice came through. ""Don't worry. We won't let her in. You'll still be the only princess at the estate.""

Everyone's judgmental stares burned into me. Anyone else would've slunk off by now, but I stayed glued to my chair, waiting out the full fifteen minutes until they returned.

When they saw me still sitting there shamelessly, their faces darkened. Clearly, they hadn't expected me to be this thick-skinned.

Please. I'd finally gotten my ticket into old money. Only an idiot would give that up over a few stupid comments.

""Ahem, well, Megan, since you came back so suddenly, we haven't had time to prepare a room at home. You can stay in your rental for now. Chloe will give you living expenses so you can get a nicer place.""

A room in their thousand-square-foot estate needed preparation?

They just didn't want me coming home.

Sophie hid behind Chloe, shooting me a smug look.

I nodded. ""Fine.""

Samuel looked satisfied, like I was being reasonable.

""But since I'm back, you can't just give me living expenses, right?"" I changed my tone. ""I heard you prepared shares for my sister. Where are mine?""

They stared at me in shock.

Chapter 2

Samuel clearly was used to bossing me around, pulling out his boss-to-employee attitude. ""What are you talking about! That's not for you to take!""

I nodded and stood up. ""Alright then, I can see you don't really want me to acknowledge you as family, so I won't.""

I actually started walking away.

Chloe frantically stopped me.

After all, they were old money. News that their child had been switched at birth was already spreading.

If people found out I hadn't actually returned to the family, it would look bad for them.

She said, ""The shares issue needs discussion. We'll give them to you eventually.""

I replied, ""No, give them now.""

Were these adults really trying to stall me?

Samuel frowned. ""Stop being ridiculous!""

""Look, we're blood relatives, you won't even let me come home, and you won't give me any compensation. What's the point of this fake press conference? I bet these reporters are in your pocket anyway. I'm leaving.""

""Megan!"" Sophie called out, her eyes red and watery as she bit her lip. ""You misunderstood! I was just worried you wouldn't adapt to the new environment—that's why I suggested you stay at the rental first.""

I laughed. ""Miss, only rich people can't adapt to poor people's houses. When do poor people not adapt to mansions?""

Sophie's eyes got redder, tears threatening to fall. ""I'm... I'm sorry. I will let you come home...""

Samuel stepped in front of her. ""If you can't speak properly, keep your mouth shut.""

""What's it to you?""

Samuel froze.

I was his go-to person for everything - smiling through gritted teeth while mentally telling him where to shove it.

""Mr. Sullivan, you're my brother now. Is it appropriate to use that employee tone with me?""

Samuel frowned.

I walked past him to look at the still-crying Sophie. ""Miss, you don't need to look so wronged. After all, I should've been coming home since birth.""

Chapter 3

In the Rolls-Royce, the family sat in tense silence.

Chloe kept wiping Sophie's tears.

Only I, riding in a Rolls for the first time, ignored everyone's stares and touched everything, looking around curiously.

Just as I was examining the starlight ceiling, Chloe spoke up, ""The Parker boy is coming to pick you up later. You can get to know each other.""

I caught the hesitation in her voice. ""What's our relationship with the Parkers?""

Samuel said impatiently, ""Arranged marriage.""

I instinctively looked at Sophie. ""Then she should know him, right?""

Sophie bit her lower lip, gripping her dress tightly.

Samuel sneered. ""Of course, they've been friends for 26 years. You can't compare.""

Chloe tried to smooth things over. ""Megan, we respect your feelings. Although the agreement says you're engaged to the Parkers, Sophie and he grew up together all these years. If you don't like him, we won't force you.""

I picked at the car's decorations.

If I couldn't read between the lines of my birth mother's hint, all my years in corporate would've been wasted.

I soon met Preston Parker, who was tall with long legs at six-foot-three - cute and exactly my type.

But Sophie got to the car door first. ""Preston!""

She threw herself into his arms, said nothing, and just cried like that.

Preston looked flustered for a moment before looking up and seeing me, his brow furrowed.

Sophie pulled back from his embrace, seeming to remember something, and pushed Preston toward me. ""Sorry, sis, I... I didn't mean anything by it. I'm not trying to steal Preston from you...""

Preston looked at Sophie in surprise.

Sophie bit her lip, tears falling. ""Go on, She was always meant to be engaged to you... I... I'm just the fake one...""

Watching his former love painfully giving him up, Preston's eyes flashed with heartache as he glanced at me.

His gaze was ice-cold. ""I don't like her.""

""No, Preston."" Sophie shook her head. ""You two are the real arranged couple.""

I raised my hand. ""Um...""

""I don't like her means I don't like her. I only like you."" Preston ignored what I was saying.

I coughed. ""No, I wanted to say...""

""Forget it, Preston, she's back now..."" Sophie cried.

""Hello?""

""So what if she's back? Some bottom-feeder nobody, thinking she can steal from you?""

""But...""

""Are you two done!"" I was genuinely pissed.

Sophie quickly stepped between Preston and me. ""I won't steal him from you, don't misunderstand! I know my place!""

""You really want to give him to me?"" I stared at her.

Sophie froze, sobbing. ""Of course...""

""Fine.""

Sophie's eyes widened.

Preston refused. ""I'm not interested in you.""

""Is that really up to you?"" I lifted my chin. ""I heard we were arranged from birth and there's some agreement? You can marry my sister if you want. Pay the penalty fee.""

The agreement was signed as a joke between the families back then, but the penalty was astronomically high.

Though it was meant as a joke, if I really wanted to enforce it, it would hold up.

Preston gritted his teeth.

I said, ""If you don't want to pay up, just behave and marry me.""

Preston clenched his fists.

I smiled at Sophie. ""Thanks for giving him up, sis.""

Sophie suddenly dropped to her knees with a ""thud!""

Chapter 4

If someone had told me yesterday that the princess next to me would kneel and kowtow to me, I would've thought I was crazy.

But Sophie really did bow deeply, her forehead turning red. ""I'm begging you to let me be with him! Although you and Preston were arranged from birth, you are the real Sullivan heiress. You'll have everything you want in the future. But I only have Preston...""

Preston immediately pulled her into his arms, glaring at me. ""You're going too far!""

Samuel also shoved me hard. ""You're bullying her again!""

My parents rushed forward to hold Sophie, comforting her gently.

Chloe looked at me. ""Megan, don't make things difficult for your sister.""

""I'm not making things difficult for her."" I stepped closer to Sophie. ""You personally said you'd give him to me. Didn't I confirm it with you? Since you decided to give him to me, why are you acting like I stole something from you when I actually take him?""

I crouched in front of Sophie. ""If you don't want to give him up, don't say it. Otherwise, I really will take him.""

Sophie looked scared and shrank into Samuel's arms.

I stood up with a cold laugh, glancing at Preston who was glaring at me. ""Don't worry, I was just messing with you. I'm not interested.""

Preston's breath caught as he gritted his teeth hard.

Weird.

When I showed interest, he didn't. When I didn't, he got upset.

Chapter 5

The next day when I woke up, a Van Cleef & Arpels necklace was sitting in front of me.

Looking at my parents's smiling faces, I understood—when something seems off, there's definitely a catch.

Sure enough, Chloe spoke up, ""Megan, about the shares, we've thought it over. We'll definitely give them to you. But the stock transfer we decided to give Sophie has already gone through. Wait for us to grow the company bigger, then we'll give you your fair share.""

Dad chimed in, ""Yeah, you're our biological daughter. Don't worry.""

So this was their game.

Yesterday the transfer hadn't happened, but after I went to sleep, the shares went to Sophie.

Where was the sincerity in leaving me an inheritance?

But...

I picked up the Van Cleef necklace worth less than a hundred grand and teared up. ""Okay, you're my parents after all...""

Seeing this, Chloe's eyes flashed with sympathy.

I kept wiping my tears. ""I know I wasn't raised by you, so even though I'm your biological daughter, I'll never get the treatment sister gets. I get it. I won't ask for a single share. Don't worry.""

""How can you say that? You silly girl!""

Chloe pulled me into her arms. ""You're our biological daughter, that will never change!""

Dad nodded. ""We're happy you're understanding, but you can't say things like that!""

I sniffled. ""Do you really love me?""

""Of course! How could parents not love their own child!""

""Then... transfer me to overseas operations. I don't want shares, just let me manage the division.""

They both froze.

Chapter 6

I was nervous making this request and afraid they'd see my ambition, but after coming home and witnessing their mindset, I doubted the Sullivan family had decades left anyway.

Samuel managed the domestic market, and I couldn't get in. My parents would never give me real power.

The only breakthrough I could make was overseas—I no longer wanted these Sullivan shares, but real power in my hands.

Maybe my acting was good, or maybe they still had some parental feelings for me, because they agreed.

They even promised. ""Good girl, work hard. If you can develop the overseas market, any extra profits are yours!""

My eyes lit up. ""Really?""

""Really.""

""Then sign an agreement!""

I quickly had someone draft one.

They looked confused but signed it, thinking I was just a low-level employee—they didn't know I hadn't climbed higher because Samuel's cronies were blocking every promotion path.

All I needed was an opening—even the tiniest one—and I'd tear it open at any cost and fight my way out.

But at dinner, when Sophie learned I was leaving, her eyes immediately turned red and she got up to leave, prompting the Sullivan family to frantically pull her back.

She looked at me pitifully. ""Are you applying overseas because you don't want to live in the same place as me? If you don't want to see me, I can move out. I'll live in your old rental apartment.""

""No way!"" Samuel frowned. ""That dump isn't fit for you! If anyone's living there, it should be her!""

I gripped myfork tighter.

This moron boss was as infuriating as ever.

""But if I don't leave, she will leave... I'm just the fake heiress. After being wrongly loved for so many years, how can I take her things?""

My parents immediately dropped their forks and pulled her into their arms.

""Megan, stop making things difficult for your sister. Forget it.""

""Yeah, we'll give you some position domestically. We're canceling your ticket.""

Like hell. I'd fought with these people for so long just for some meaningless position?

""Then I'm leaving."" I put down my chopsticks and actually left.

My parents grabbed me. ""Why are you being so unreasonable? Your sister is so upset and you're still throwing a tantrum!""

I said, ""Do I have the right to throw tantrums?""

They froze.

""You won't give me shares, won't even let me look at some failing overseas market. What's my worth in your hearts that would support me throwing tantrums? You're not sincere, and I won't be shameless."" I pulled away and strode off.

The servants quickly brought me back.

That night, I don't know what my parents, and Sophie discussed.

But Sophie finally stopped making a fuss.

Going to the bathroom that night, I overheard my parents talking, ""If she wants to go, let her go. The overseas market has been losing money for a year. What can a low-level employee accomplish?""

""We'll have to bail her out anyway.""

""Once she realizes she's in the wrong, she won't target our Sophie anymore.""

I laughed coldly and left quietly.

The next day, my parents, and Samuel, who were supposed to see me off, didn't show up.

They called me, ""Sophie's puppy is sick, so we're taking her to the vet clinic. You're more independent, so we won't see you off. Take care of yourself."" Then they hung up.

Standing in the airport, I couldn't help but laugh—good thing I'd arranged my own ride instead of actually waiting for these people to see me off.

But now that I was leaving, they'd never be able to control me again.

Whether I was a low-level employee or someone more qualified than Samuel to hold a high position—they'd find out soon enough.

Chapter 7

The overseas market that had been hemorrhaging money for a year straight not only turned profitable in my third month but exploded globally, with performance rivaling our domestic market.

My mom and Dad, who hadn't contacted me for three months, were stunned.

They called me for the first time, clearly surprised.

I always brushed them off, saying I was busy, and hung up.

Finally, they got annoyed. ""It's been three months. Don't you miss your family? We've all been thinking about you!""

I laughed. ""Your way of thinking about me is not sending a single message for three months? Can't afford plane tickets or data plans?""

""You silly girl...""

""Okay, I have clients to meet. Take care of yourselves.""

I hung up—they didn't bother me for a while after that, but when they suddenly called, it meant they needed something from me, and I wasn't giving them a chance to sweet-talk me.

But I didn't expect them to directly transfer Sophie over.

She parachuted in as CEO, pushing me out of my position, with a transfer order demanding I return home and hand the overseas market to Sophie.

I finally understood why they'd suddenly called me.

I didn't expect them to be this shameless—when I wouldn't take the bait, they forced their person on me.

I tore up the transfer order and ignored Sophie's existence, continuing to work with my team.

Come on, parachute leadership still needs to see who actually calls the shots, right?

My parents called immediately. ""Are you not listening to us anymore? Sophie is crying because you're squeezing her out!""

I sent them a copy of the original agreement. ""You said back then that any overseas profits would be mine. I haven't even sued you for breach of contract yet. How dare you come after me?""

They were speechless.

I thought they'd be more sensible.

But the next day I woke up to my assistant frantically finding me. ""This is bad, Ms. Shaw! They're saying you stole Ms. Sullivan's achievements! That you're workplace bullying!""

I opened the trending topics.

She’s pretty but sometimes I feel like she goes out of her way to make everyone like her and it’s starting to get under my skin.

My best friends are all over the place with interests it's hard to keep score. One of us is a huge Star Wars fan another is really into K-pop another is obsessed with hiking and outdoors bullshit. When any of them mention something if Andy hasn’t seen it she says ""I’ve never tried that but it sounds really cool"" or ""God bless I wish I had the time energy strength for that."" My female best friend Mary likes K-Pop and what Andy does is immediately say the line above then suddenly Mary asks my girlfriend for her phone and she's making a Spotify account for her and making a K-Pop playlist and even my guys are hunched over her pink iPhone and talking about stuff I have never heard them talk about around me.

It happens constantly even with my family. People mention something they like and she starts asking questions and then they’re hooked like whores to money or something. I get that she wasn't that much of a social person in high school because she was focused on getting into a good college and maintaining a 4.2 GPA. And I get that she has to make up for that lost time somehow but her freshman syndrome is showing.

One of my friends mentioned some anime and everyone started talking about Japan. The week after she showed up with homemade onigiri for everyone to try just because. Everyone was touched but I can't help thinking isn’t it a little much?

And I don't think it's normal anymore because my own best friends will message her out of the blue like ""hey I finished my thesis proposal movie whatever and you can see it I can treat you and Jacob to coffee at Capital One."" What the fuck. From their best friend now I'm just ""and Jacob."" And I will be the one to fucking walk just to meet them because Capital One is closer to where she studies.

I’ve noticed when I talk the conversation doesn’t really stay on me. I’ll bring up something about my Discord channel and somehow it gets turned into a group discussion where she’s asking them to share about their jobs. I get that she’s just being nice but I can’t shake this nagging thought that she’s trying too hard to get everyone to like her.

I told her I feel like she’s thrusting herself out there but she acted hurt and said she thought they like her and that she thought she was just caring about other people’s stuff.

My friends and family all really like her which should be a good thing but it bothers me. They’ll even send her memes directly instead of going through me. And I’ll admit I’m not used to people giving someone else this much attention when I’m around but it's as if they've all been hiding all this information about themselves from me and intentionally only showing this side of themselves to my girlfriend.

1n0cr5p,https://www.reddit.com/r/fiction/comments/1n0cr5p/the_smallest_case/,The smallest case,"# The Smallest Case

Detective Frank Morrison had traded his badge for a fishing rod three months ago, and most days, he didn't miss the weight of either one. His small cabin sat perched on the banks of Willow Creek, where the only crimes were committed by bass stealing his bait and the occasional raccoon ransacking his garbage.

This particular afternoon found him in his usual spot—a weathered lawn chair positioned perfectly in the shade of an old oak, his line cast into the slow-moving water. The sun filtered through the leaves in lazy patterns, and for once, Frank's mind wasn't racing through cold cases or replaying the arguments with his captain that had finally pushed him toward retirement.

He was just settling deeper into his chair when something metallic pinged off his shoulder and landed in the grass beside him.

""What the hell?"" Frank leaned over to examine the object. It was tiny—no bigger than a quarter—and unlike anything he'd ever seen. The surface appeared to be made of some kind of brushed metal that seemed to shift colors in the light, displaying patterns that hurt his eyes if he stared too long. It was perfectly spherical except for what looked like microscopic seams running along its surface.

His detective instincts, dormant but never truly dead, kicked in immediately. He'd seen plenty of debris wash up from the creek over the years, but this hadn't come from the water. It had fallen from above, and the nearest aircraft route was miles away.

Frank picked it up carefully, surprised by how light it felt despite its metallic appearance. As he turned it in his palm, he could swear he felt the faintest vibration, like a cell phone set to silent. But that was impossible—nothing this small could have any kind of power source.

*You're retired,* he reminded himself. *Not your problem anymore.*

But even as he thought it, Frank found himself slipping the strange object into his shirt pocket instead of tossing it back into the creek.

That evening, as he fried up the single bass he'd managed to catch, Frank kept reaching up to touch his pocket, feeling the odd little sphere through the fabric. The rational part of his mind—the part that had closed dozens of cases through methodical investigation—told him it was probably just some kind of unusual meteorite or space junk. But thirty years of police work had taught him to trust his instincts, and his instincts were screaming that this was something else entirely.

He went to bed early, the object now sitting on his nightstand where he could keep an eye on it. The last thing he remembered before sleep took him was the faint impression that the tiny sphere was glowing, though when he turned on the lamp to check, it looked as inert as ever.

The dream began in darkness, but not the comfortable darkness of sleep. This was different—vast and cold and filled with pinpricks of distant light. Frank found himself floating, weightless, surrounded by the deep black of space.

*Please,* a voice said, though he heard no sound. The words simply appeared in his mind, carrying with them a sense of desperate urgency. *Please help us.*

Frank tried to speak, to ask who was there, but found he had no voice in this place. Instead, his thoughts seemed to project outward of their own accord.

*Who are you? Where are you?*

Images flashed through his consciousness—not quite visual, not quite memory, but something in between. He saw vast distances compressed into impossibly small spaces, civilizations that rose and fell in the time it took a heart to beat, and creatures of light and thought that existed in scales beyond human comprehension.

*We are the Keth'miran exploration pod Seventeen-Seven-Nine,* the voice continued, and now Frank could sense that it wasn't just one consciousness but many, speaking in perfect harmony. *Our vessel has suffered critical damage. We require assistance to reach the beacon point for extraction.*

*You're... in the ship? The little metal ball?*

A wave of something that might have been amusement washed over him. *Your concepts of size are... limited. What you call a 'little metal ball' contains our entire expedition. We exist at scales your language cannot adequately describe.*

Frank's dreaming mind struggled to process this. *How many of you are there?*

*Our population fluctuates, but currently we number approximately seven thousand individuals.*

*Seven thousand people in something the size of a quarter?*

*Not people as you understand them. We are explorers, scientists, artists. We have been cataloging your world for what you would measure as six of your months. Our mission was nearly complete when our dimensional stabilizers failed. We crashed, as you might say, into your normal space-time.*

Frank felt a familiar stirring in his chest—the same feeling he'd gotten whenever a victim's family had looked at him with desperate hope, pleading for justice, for answers, for someone to care enough to help. It was the feeling that had made him a good cop, and the feeling that had eventually burned him out.

*What do you need me to do?*

Relief flooded through the connection, so intense it nearly woke him. *There is a place—coordinates we will provide—where our people maintain an emergency beacon. If you can transport us there, we can signal for extraction before our life support fails completely.*

*When?*

*Time moves differently for us, but in your scale... perhaps thirty-six hours before our systems shut down permanently.*

Frank was quiet for a long moment, or what passed for quiet in a space where thoughts were the only sound. Finally: *I'm retired. I don't do rescues anymore.*

The aliens—Keth'miran, he corrected himself—said nothing, but he could feel their disappointment like a weight in his chest. In the silence, he found himself thinking about his last case, the one that had finally broken him. A missing child, a family destroyed, and Frank's inability to find answers that made any difference.

*Where?* he asked.

*Approximately four hundred miles northwest. A place your people call Cascade Peak.*

Frank knew it—a remote mountain in the national forest, accessible only by hiking trails and four-wheel-drive roads. It would be a hell of a trip for a man his age, especially with the time limit they were facing.

*I'll need supplies. Transportation.*

*We are grateful beyond measure, Detective Morrison.*

*How do you know my name?*

*We have been observing. We chose you specifically.*

*Why?*

*Because,* the collective voice said gently, *even in retirement, you cannot ignore a call for help.*

Frank woke with a start, his heart racing. Dawn was breaking outside his window, painting the creek in shades of gold and amber. For a moment, he almost convinced himself it had been just a dream—stress, maybe, or too much coffee before bed.

Then he looked at his nightstand.

The small sphere was definitely glowing now, pulsing with a soft blue light that seemed to come from deep within its core. As he watched, the light flickered in what looked almost like a pattern.

Morse code, Frank realized. It was spelling out coordinates.

He was already reaching for his truck keys before he fully understood what he was doing. Thirty years on the force had taught him to recognize the real thing when he saw it, and this was as real as it got.

Besides, he thought as he carefully placed the sphere back in his shirt pocket, he'd been getting bored with fishing anyway.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Brandon Holt vs. Nuno Borges: A Tale of Two Trajectories**  
The 2025 US Open’s second round throws a curveball at Nuno Borges: a matchup against Brandon Holt, a player whose ATP record this year reads like a grass-court ghost story (1-7). Meanwhile, Borges, the seasoned Portuguese pro, is the kind of guy who’d shrug off a Grand Slam exit by saying, “At least I didn’t trip over my own shoelaces like Jaime Faria.” Let’s break this down with the precision of a linesman and the wit of a tennis ball bouncing off a clown’s nose.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why Borges Is the Favorite

The bookmakers aren’t just throwing darts here. Nuno Borges is listed at **1.36-1.38 decimal odds** (implying a 73-74% implied probability of winning), while Holt’s **3.08-3.1 odds** suggest you’d need a time machine to bet on him profitably. The spread (-4.5 games) and total (38 games) further underscore Borges’ dominance: he’s expected to win comfortably, like a tourist in New York who *actually knows* the best bodega for coffee.

Holt’s ATP resume this year? A 1-7 record on grass, which is about as effective as a screen door on a submarine. But here’s the twist: Holt’s Challenger circuit success (30-11) proves he can thrive in lower-stakes environments. Still, the US Open isn’t a Challenger event—it’s a stage where Madison Keys once committed **89 unforced errors**. If Holt’s nerves crack under pressure, he’ll join her in the “Oops, Did I Do That?” Hall of Fame.

---

### Digesting the News: Grass vs. Hard Courts

Borges, meanwhile, is a hard-court veteran. Last year, he reached the US Open fourth round, a feat that says more about his resilience than his rankings. This year, he’s 11-11 on hardcourts, which is roughly the same win rate as a gambler betting on “lucky losers.” But let’s not forget: Borges is one of only two Portuguese players still standing (alongside Francisco Cabral, who’s busy dodging doubles drama). Portugal’s tennis hopes are riding on his shou

No more spending weeks on logos + packaging + websites + even interior decor with designers. You just type a simple prompt—like “Modern minimalist coffee brand: make a logo + website + packaging”—and it spits out a *complete brand kit* in MINUTES.  
And it’s not just basic stuff: supports text/image/multimodal inputs, cranks out vector icons, 3D renders, even animated videos. Covers everything from social media posts to T-shirt designs to VR assets.  
  
Now I’m genuinely curious—let’s debate:  


* For small business owners: Would you trust an AI to build your entire brand identity? Or is the “human touch” still non-negotiable?
* For designers: Is this a tool to speed up your workflow… or a threat to your gigs?
* Anyone tried it yet? Does the output actually look polished, or is it just generic AI clutter?

A simplistic example:

Lily: I like coffee too. Do you drink coffee at night?

So oftentimes what might have been a richer conversation is pretty lame.

I know it’s hard to do this because even in real life if you can’t see someone it can be hard to tell if they are done talking. But it would be nice if I could say something like “give me a moment”, and she would respond with “no problem, take your time” and then wait.

1n0clwd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n0clwd,Your 2025 Budget is Already Obsolete. Here's How to Fix It.,"# Beyond the Spreadsheet: 12 Emerging Trends in Small Business Budgeting for 2025

As a small business owner, you're no stranger to wearing multiple hats. You're the CEO, the head of marketing, the lead salesperson, and often, the chief financial officer. Juggling all these roles is a monumental task, and it's easy to let some things slide. But if there's one thing you can't afford to neglect, it's your **budgeting**.

For too long, small business budgeting has been a once-a-year, set-it-and-forget-it affair. A frantic scramble at the end of the year to pull together a spreadsheet that, more often than not, ends up gathering dust in a digital folder. But the business world of 2025 is a different beast altogether. It's faster, more unpredictable, and more competitive than ever before. And in this new landscape, a static, outdated budget is a recipe for disaster.

The good news? A new era of **financial planning and analysis** is dawning for small businesses. Fueled by technology and a new way of thinking, budgeting is transforming from a dreaded chore into a powerful tool for driving **small business growth**. It's becoming more dynamic, more intelligent, and more forward-looking than ever before.

So, grab a cup of coffee, and let's dive into the 12 emerging trends in small business budgeting that will define 2025. These aren't just abstract concepts; they're actionable strategies that you can start implementing today to build a more resilient, profitable, and future-proof business.

# 1. AI-Powered Forecasting and Automation: Your New Crystal Ball

If you're still manually crunching numbers in a spreadsheet, you're leaving a massive opportunity on the table. **Artificial intelligence (AI)** is no longer the stuff of science fiction; it's a game-changer for small business budgeting. AI-powered tools can analyze your historical data, identify patterns you might have missed, and generate incredibly accurate forecasts for your revenue, expenses, and **cash flow**.

**What this means for you:**

* **Save Time and Reduce Errors:** Automate the tedious task of data entry and reconciliation, freeing you up to focus on strategy.
* **More Accurate Predictions:** AI algorithms can account for seasonality, market trends, and other variables to give you a much clearer picture of what's ahead.
* **Proactive Decision-Making:** Get early warnings about potential cash flow shortages or unexpected expenses, so you can take action before they become major problems.

**Best Practice:** Explore accounting software with built-in AI features or dedicated financial planning and analysis (FP&A) platforms designed for small businesses.

# 2. Real-Time Budgeting and Dynamic Financial Planning: Your Living, Breathing Financial Roadmap

The days of the static annual budget are numbered. In 2025, it's all about **real-time budgeting** and **dynamic financial planning**. Think of your budget not as a rigid set of rules, but as a living, breathing document that evolves with your business.

**What this means for you:**

* **Agility and Adaptability:** Quickly adjust your budget in response to changing market conditions, new opportunities, or unexpected challenges.
* **Better Decision-Making:** With up-to-the-minute financial data at your fingertips, you can make smarter, more informed decisions on the fly.
* **Continuous Improvement:** Regularly review and refine your budget to ensure it's always aligned with your goals.

**Best Practice:** Use cloud-based accounting software that syncs with your bank accounts and other financial tools to get a real-time view of your finances. Schedule monthly or quarterly budget reviews to make adjustments as needed.

# 3. Zero-Based Budgeting (ZBB): Justify Every Penny

**Zero-based budgeting (ZBB)** is a powerful technique that's gaining traction among small businesses. Instead of simply adjusting the previous year's budget, ZBB requires you to build your budget from scratch, justifying every single expense.

**What this means for you:**

* **Cut Waste and Increase Efficiency:** By forcing you to scrutinize every line item, ZBB helps you identify and eliminate unnecessary spending.
* **Align Spending with Your Goals:** Ensure that every dollar you spend is directly contributing to your strategic priorities.
* **Foster a Culture of Accountability:** When every expense has to be justified, it encourages your team to be more mindful of their spending.

**Best Practice:** You don't have to implement ZBB for your entire business at once. Start with one or two departments or expense categories, and gradually roll it out across the organization.

# 4. Scenario Planning and ""What-If"" Analysis: Prepare for Anything

The future is uncertain, but that doesn't mean you can't be prepared. **Scenario planning** and **""what-if"" analysis** are powerful tools that allow you to model different potential futures and see how they would impact your finances.

**What this means for you:**

* **Build Resilience:** By stress-testing your budget against different scenarios (e.g., a sudden drop in sales, a major new competitor), you can build a more resilient business that's better equipped to handle whatever comes its way.
* **Identify Opportunities:** Scenario planning can also help you identify potential opportunities and develop strategies to capitalize on them.
* **Make More Confident Decisions:** When you've considered a range of possible outcomes, you can make more confident decisions, even in the face of uncertainty.

**Best Practice:** Use a financial modeling tool to create best-case, worst-case, and most-likely scenarios for your business. This will give you a much clearer understanding of your potential risks and opportunities.

# 5. Cash Flow-Centric Budgeting: Cash is Still King

Profit is important, but **cash flow** is the lifeblood of your business. In 2025, we'll see a growing emphasis on **cash flow-centric budgeting**, where the primary focus is on ensuring you have enough cash on hand to meet your obligations and invest in growth.

**What this means for you:**

* **Avoid Cash Crunches:** A cash flow-centric budget helps you anticipate and prepare for potential shortfalls, so you're not caught off guard.
* **Optimize Your Working Capital:** By closely managing your accounts receivable and accounts payable, you can free up cash to invest in other areas of your business.
* **Make More Strategic Investments:** With a clear picture of your cash position, you can make more strategic decisions about when to invest in new equipment, hire new employees, or expand into new markets.

**Best Practice:** Create a detailed cash flow forecast that projects your inflows and outflows on a weekly or monthly basis. This will give you the visibility you need to manage your cash effectively.

# 6. Subscription-Based Budgeting for Predictable Revenue: Smooth Out the Bumps

The subscription economy is booming, and for good reason. A subscription-based business model can provide you with a steady stream of predictable revenue, which makes **budgeting** a whole lot easier.

**What this means for you:**

* **More Accurate Forecasting:** With a predictable stream of recurring revenue, you can forecast your income with a much higher degree of accuracy.
* **Improved Cash Flow:** A steady stream of subscription payments can help you smooth out the peaks and valleys in your cash flow.
* **Increased Customer Lifetime Value:** Subscription models encourage long-term customer relationships, which can significantly increase the lifetime value of each customer.

**Best Practice:** If it makes sense for your business, consider offering a subscription-based service or product. This can be a great way to build a more stable and predictable revenue stream.

# 7. Integration of ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) Metrics: Budgeting with a Conscience

In 2025, it's not enough to just be profitable; consumers and employees are increasingly looking for businesses that are also making a positive impact on the world. This is where **ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance)** metrics come in.

**What this means for you:**

* **Attract and Retain Talent:** A strong commitment to ESG can help you attract and retain top talent, especially among younger generations.
* **Enhance Your Brand Reputation:** Consumers are more likely to support businesses that are environmentally and socially responsible.
* **Identify New Opportunities:** Integrating ESG into your budgeting process can help you identify new opportunities for innovation and growth.

**Best Practice:** Start by identifying a few key ESG metrics that are relevant to your business (e.g., energy consumption, employee diversity, community involvement). Then, set goals for improvement and track your progress over time.

# 8. Focus on Cybersecurity Spending as a Core Budget Item: Protect Your Digital Assets

In our increasingly digital world, **cybersecurity** is no longer an optional extra; it's a critical business necessity. In 2025, we'll see more and more small businesses treating cybersecurity spending as a core budget item, right alongside rent and payroll.

**What this means for you:**

* **Protect Your Business from Costly Attacks:** A data breach or ransomware attack can be devastating for a small business. Investing in cybersecurity can help you avoid these costly disasters.
* **Build Trust with Your Customers:** When customers know that you're taking their data security seriously, it builds trust and confidence in your brand.
* **Comply with Regulations:** Depending on your industry, there may be specific data privacy regulations that you're required to comply with.

**Best Practice:** Work with a cybersecurity expert to assess your risks and develop a comprehensive security plan. This should include everything from employee training to data encryption and regular security audits.

# 9. The Rise of Fractional CFOs and On-Demand Financial Expertise: Get the Expertise You Need, Without the Full-Time Cost

Not every small business can afford a full-time Chief Financial Officer (CFO). But that doesn't mean you have to go it alone. The rise of **fractional CFOs** and **on-demand financial expertise** is making it easier and more affordable for small businesses to get the high-level financial guidance they need.

**What this means for you:**

* **Access to Top-Tier Talent:** Get the strategic financial advice you need from experienced professionals, without the cost of a full-time hire.
* **A Fresh Perspective:** An outside expert can bring a fresh perspective to your business and help you identify opportunities and challenges you might have missed.
* **Scalable Support:** As your business grows, you can easily scale up the level of support you need.

**Best Practice:** If you're struggling with your financial planning and analysis, consider hiring a fractional CFO or a financial consultant. They can help you develop a more strategic approach to budgeting and financial management.

# 10. Personalization and Customer-Centric Budgeting: Invest in What Your Customers Really Want

In the age of the customer, a one-size-fits-all approach to marketing and product development no longer cuts it. In 2025, we'll see a growing trend towards **personalization** and **customer-centric budgeting**, where businesses are using data to understand their customers' needs and preferences and then allocating their resources accordingly.

**What this means for you:**

* **Higher Customer Satisfaction and Loyalty:** When you deliver personalized experiences that meet your customers' specific needs, you'll build stronger, more loyal relationships.
* **Improved Marketing ROI:** By targeting your marketing efforts to the right customers with the right message, you'll get a much better return on your investment.
* **More Innovative Products and Services:** By listening to your customers and understanding their pain points, you can develop more innovative products and services that they'll love.

**Best Practice:** Use a customer relationship management (CRM) system to collect and analyze data about your customers. This will give you the insights you need to create more personalized experiences.

# 11. Investing in Employee Wellness and Development: Your Team is Your Greatest Asset

The ""Great Resignation"" has taught us a valuable lesson: your employees are your most valuable asset. In 2025, smart small businesses will be investing more in **employee wellness and development** as a way to attract and retain top talent.

**What this means for you:**

* **Increased Productivity and Engagement:** When your employees are happy, healthy, and engaged, they're more productive and more likely to go the extra mile for your business.
* **Lower Turnover:** Investing in your employees' well-being and professional development can significantly reduce turnover, which can save you a lot of money in the long run.
* **A Stronger Company Culture:** A commitment to employee wellness and development can help you build a stronger, more positive company culture.

**Best Practice:** When you're creating your budget, be sure to allocate funds for things like employee wellness programs, professional development opportunities, and competitive benefits packages.

# 12. Leveraging Data Analytics for Deeper Insights: Go Beyond the Numbers

In 2025, it's not enough to just collect data; you need to be able to analyze it and use it to make smarter decisions. **Data analytics** tools are becoming more accessible and affordable for small businesses, making it easier than ever to go beyond the surface-level numbers and get deeper insights into your business.

**What this means for you:**

* **Identify Your Most Profitable Customers and Products:** Data analytics can help you identify which customers and products are driving the most profit, so you can focus your efforts where they'll have the biggest impact.
* **Optimize Your Pricing Strategy:** By analyzing your sales data, you can identify the optimal price point for your products and services.
* **Uncover Hidden Trends and Opportunities:** Data analytics can help you uncover hidden trends and opportunities that you might have otherwise missed.

**Best Practice:** Invest in a business intelligence (BI) or data analytics tool that can help you visualize your data and get the insights you need to make smarter decisions.

# The Future of Your Business Starts with Your Budget

The world of small business is changing at a breakneck pace, and your approach to **budgeting** needs to keep up. By embracing these 12 emerging trends, you can transform your budget from a static, outdated document into a powerful tool for driving **small business growth**.

It's time to say goodbye to the old way of doing things and embrace a more dynamic, intelligent, and forward-looking approach to **financial planning and analysis**. The future of your business depends on it.

I noticed the issue with my dining area (600 sq ft) is that we can smell the body odor when customers walk inside or when the kids are running around the shop. We generally left the temp at 74-75F, but reduce the temp to 71F if there are a lot of customers. I recently consulted an HVAC specialist about this issue and he recommended to have 2 more supply ducts and 2 return ducts installed near the door since the original 2 return ducts are placed at the back of the shop.

And with less negotiating power than their Fortune 500 rivals to spread the costs across their supply chain, these firms say they have to pass the added expense on to their customers.AdvertisementSmall and midsize businesses make up 96 percent of the toy industry, which includes board games, said Greg Ahearn, president and chief executive of the Toy Association, a trade group. As a low-margin business that relies mostly on manufacturing in China, the toy industry was one of the first consumer goods sectors to increase prices for shoppers. Even publicly traded toy companies, such as Hasbro, Mattel, Spin Master and Jakks Pacific, have warned of price increases. In May alone, the jump in toy prices was six times as high as overall inflation, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.“We’re the canary in the coal mine as an industry,” Ahearn said.While Trump this month delayed the higher levies on Chinese imports another 90 days, Ahearn expects that prices will continue rising. Among Toy Association members, 75 percent of small companies and 94 percent of midsize companies plan to raise prices this holiday season — when the bulk of sales occur — because of tariffs, he said.In a statement, White House spokesman Kush Desai declined to address the specific impact on the toy business but said the president’s “trade deals have unlocked unprecedented market access for American exports.” Because of those agreements and the Trump tax cuts, he added, “American businesses and families alike have the certainty that the best is yet to come.”A custom Clue game by WS Game. (Jake Belcher/For The Washington Post)Industry experts see a much bleaker picture. In particular, inventory for the holidays could be in jeopardy because companies held back with their ordering, fearing they couldn’t afford the steep levy, said James Zahn, editor in chief of the trade publication the Toy Book and senior editor at the Toy Insider. That pushed toy imports from China down by 45 percent in May year over year, according to a report published by economic research firm John Dunham & Associates, citing the U.S. Commerce Department. Imports in June dropped 47 percent.AdvertisementJobs are also at stake: 55 percent of midsize and 45 percent of small businesses have laid off — or plan to lay off — staff as a result of tariffs, according to the Toy Association. Hasbro, Mattel, Funko, Spin Master and Jakks Pacific — the big five in publicly traded toy companies — all cut jobs, Zahn said.“My entire LinkedIn feed is just loaded with green circles of ‘open to work,’” he said. “I’ve never seen this in my lifetime.”‘Absolute survival’Back in Manchester-by-the-Sea, Massachusetts, the family worked through how to manage the financial hit without laying off any of the company’s 22 employees. Jonathan, Kerry and Dana stopped taking pay for five months, froze some retirement benefits, cut back on outside contractors and pulled out of a toy show in Atlanta. They also raised prices twice this year, most recently in early July. Jonathan hopes it’s the final increase for the year.“It’s been a year of absolute survival,” he said.The volatility in Trump’s tariff policy has made it almost impossible to plan, he added. Jonathan was looking at manufacturers in Vietnam, India, Thailand, Malaysia and Brazil. But in the past few months, Trump has slapped steep levies on those countries, too.“You just can’t operate a business when on any given Tuesday your price changes,” Jonathan said.A limited-edition custom Charles Fazzino Monopoly game board adorns one of the offices of WS Game. (Jake Belcher/For The Washington Post)“It’s like whack-a-mole,” Kerry added.China’s dominance is another factor. When they were hit with tariffs in Trump’s first term, many apparel and consumer goods industries moved production to emerging manufacturing hubs in Southeast Asia. But toy-making mostly stayed in China, in part because that sector wasn’t subject to those levies. To this day, about 77 percent of toys and games sold in the U.S. are still manufactured there.AdvertisementChina offers particular “manufacturing expertise and the ethical manufacturing process at the factories,” as well as cheaper labor, Ahearn said. Everything from final packaging to materials like springs, motors and plastic parts “can’t be replicated here in the U.S.”WS Game has worked with its manufacturers in China for decades, Jonathan said, estimating that his father has spent about 100 days every year in the country building relationships with factories. Still, the company is looking for manufacturing opportunities in the U.S., including a factory in East Longmeadow, Massachusetts. But it would make only one of the company’s 110 products domestically.Game boards on the production line in WS Game’s factory in China. (WS Game Co.)Scrabble tiles on the company's production line in China. (WS Game Co.)And the price of the game — a large coffee-table and bookshelf-style Monopoly set that will be released next year — will be “quite high,” Jonathan said. “I don’t know if the quality will be as good as overseas production, but we’re giving it an earnest shot.”It’s been about 50 years since the U.S. had a meaningful toy manufacturing industry, Zahn said. Many toys, including the classics, have never been made in the U.S. But every other aspect of toymaking — including invention, design, research and development, and marketing — happens in the U.S. By imposing tariffs on American companies, the administration is putting those jobs at risk, Zahn said.Advertisement“When you put this unexpected tax on the business, people end up being the first to go,” Zahn added. “The concept of this big boom in American jobs for the toy industry is essentially a myth because those production lines will be robots.”‘The dream is being crushed’It felt inevitable that Dana’s children would wind up in the toy industry — it’s all they knew growing up. Dana started working at Parker Brothers in 1979. The toy and game company, acquired by Hasbro in 1991, produced some of the most enduring board games: Monopoly, Sorry!, Risk, Trivial Pursuit, Scrabble and more.In 2000, Dana, along with his colleague Mike Doyle, left to start their own business, Winning Solutions. The company partnered with Hasbro to make special editions of its games, such as a travel version of Scrabble, as well as fresh designs exclusive to retailers.After Doyle’s retirement in 2023, Kerry and Jonathan took over as co-owners. Dana continues to have some ownership stake. In all, six family members work at WS Game.AdvertisementThe business has moved toward high-end and collectible version of the games. The current assortment includes a collection of pastel-hued game boxes that resemble books; a vintage tin collection; and wall-mounted, wood and glass versions of Scrabble, Monopoly and Clue. WS Game also made a limited-edition LeBron James Monopoly board and partnered with Target on an exclusive collection with Hearth & Hand, the brand from former HGTV stars Chip and Joanna Gaines.Custom board games by WS Game. (Jake Belcher/For The Washington Post)Monopoly game pieces made by WS Game. (Jake Belcher/For The Washington Post)Jonathan isn’t too concerned that price increases will deter his usual mid- to high-income customer who is less likely to blink at an average price increase of 10 to 12 percent — the company’s rough estimate of expected hikes. Hurting the company’s bottom line, rather, is inventory management and planning. The toy industry plans nine to 18 months in advance, he said, making it “absolutely impossible to make any type of deals, to set any type of pricing, to manage what projections will be” when trade policy continually changes. As of now, he doesn’t expect to have enough inventory to meet demand for some of his most popular items in the second half of the year. And with less to sell, revenue will take a hit.AdvertisementIt’s an issue most small and midsize toy companies are facing, because the majority of toys sold during the holidays are manufactured from April to August, Zahn said. Trump’s April announcement essentially meant a “full stop” for the industry, which restarted production and shipments in May only after the administration announced a tariff pause, Zahn said.Jonathan took a similar approach this month, when the administration announced another tariff pause. He immediately placed orders with the hope of the products being made and shipped before Nov. 10. But to ensure the quick turnover, he ordered less than he would need to meet demand and focused instead on their most popular games.He still expects that arrival on shelves by Christmas will be tight, given that the usual cycle of manufacturing to delivery requires 75 to 90 days.Even with products in motion, Jonathan said the uncertainty over inventory and delivery commitments to retail partners is keeping him up at night.“We are a success story. We were started with a folding table in the living room with $5,000 and a dream,” Jonathan said. “That dream is being crushed right now.”",1,1756182941.0,AntiTrumpAlliance,0,1.0,False
1n0cjbo,https://www.reddit.com/r/vibecoding/comments/1n0cjbo/from_vibe_coding_to_launch_how_do_you_get_noticed/,"From vibe coding to launch, how do you get noticed","Hey everyone! I’ve been stalking the posts in here for a little bit, and have appreciated reading the real life experiences and questions you all share. It’s been helpful for me on my journey. For the last while, I’ve been working on building what I hope to be an astounding app that is a collaborative hub for project and task management, support, and payroll to meet seamlessly. 

I come from a cost management and construction background, where I spent years implementing SaaS tools and leading teams. Over the past couple of years, I went on some career side quests (if you want to talk coffee, let’s be friends!) and began coding and started experimenting with AI to bring my own product ideas to life. I’ve found so far with this larger project (about 90% ready for launch now) that with vibe coding, I have been able to build something pretty incredible while only coding about 10-15% of it myself. Of course, many more hours have been spent on testing, reviewing code, and prompting.

Now that v1 is nearly ready, my biggest question is: how do you actually get users on board with a brand-new SaaS platform? I don’t expect overnight success, but for those of you who’ve launched something non-niche that could appeal to broader but more heavily saturated markets, what outreach or marketing methods actually worked to stand out from the crowd and secure users?

* Quality/design matters more than convenience
* Have flexible timeline (3+ months)
* Enjoy the sourcing/travel process

# ❓ MAYBE worth it:

* Mid-size purchase ($5,000-10,000)
* Specific styles not available locally
* Have experience with international shipping
* Can dedicate 4-5 days to the process

* Need furniture immediately (under 2 months)
* Want someone else to handle everything
* Budget is extremely tight
* Uncomfortable with international transactions

# Ready to Take the Plunge?

**My biggest advice:** Don't try to do everything in one trip. Many successful buyers make 2-3 trips - first for research, second for major purchases, third for accessories and finishing touches.

The furniture quality and value in Foshan are genuinely exceptional, but success requires preparation, patience, and realistic expectations about the process.

1n0ccgo,https://www.reddit.com/r/HerOneBag/comments/1n0ccgo/lightest_pack_yet_what_i_missed_vs_didnt/,Lightest pack yet - what I missed vs didn’t,"Had a 3-night trip immediately followed by a 1-night trip and took the opportunity to make the 1-night as slim as possible. Tl;dr it was *great* and I still see room to cut - will definitely be pulling those lessons forward

Trip context: Flew from Northern California to LA, 1 night. Occasion was (unfortunately) a funeral, so I wanted to have a formal outfit and look put-together 

Bag: Coach tote, less than half full

Wore on the plane: 
- Uniqlo black tee
- Uniqlo black merino cardigan
- Athleta Brooklyn joggers
- Nine West Tatiana heels (black)

Clothes:
- Quince silk short PJs in black 
- Black knee-length dress from Verse
- 3 pairs of underwear

- What I took out: Second pair of shoes, casual wear for breakfast at the hotel, warm layer 
 | What I missed: Nothing - wore my pj top and joggers to breakfast instead, wasn’t cold, was fine wearing heels the whole time | What I didn’t use: 1 pair of underwear, but I struggle with UTIs so still felt worth it

Travel items and electronics:
- Phone charger
- Headphones
- Muji 8oz water bottle 
- 5ml laundry detergent
- Oyster crackers, a peach
- What I took out: Fitbit charger, travel coffee mug | What I missed: Mint tea packet for the flight | What I didn’t use: USB to plug block, hotel had a USB outlet, laundry detergent (would probably cut this next time but felt like a good insurance policy in case we needed to stay another day)

Toiletries: 
- Travel toothbrush
- Mini Wet Brush Hairbrush
- 4-in-1 makeup brush 
- Deodorant
- Travel razor w/ silicone cover 
- Small mirror
- Emergency kit (pain meds, band aids, q tips, extra hair tie, paper clip, hotel sewing kit)
- Micro tweezers
- Chella sample eyeshadow palette 
- Black eyeliner
- Brow pencil
- Travel size Anastasia brow gel
- Mascara
- Just Kissed cheek and lip stain
- 5ml face wash
- Sample size Shiseido moisturizer
- Sample size Touch in Sol primer
- 5ml face sunscreen
- 5ml hand cream
- 10ml Oribe Supershine Light hair cream
- Mini floss
- Lanolips overnight lip mask
- Neutrogena face wipe
- Vitamin C serum 
- Contact lens case 1: Serum and toothpaste
- Contact lens case 2: Retinol and cc cream
- What I took out: shampoo/conditioner/body wash, body lotion | What I missed: Nothing | What I didn’t use: black eyeliner - lined with dark eyeshadow instead, pain meds, sewing kit, paper clip, extra hair tie, tweezers, face sunscreen (bb cream has sunscreen), floss (oops), face wipe. Overall I’d try to condense this kit even more in the future, and lean further into contact lens cases, but my full makeup, hair, and skincare routine still fit in a small pencil case - so that feels like a victory.

Regular purse contents:
- Phone
- Cardholder wallet
- Passport (don’t have my RealID yet)
- Lip balm
- Ray Ban sunglasses in soft case
- What I took out: regular glasses | What I missed: Nothing | What I didn’t use: Nothing


Overall reflections:
- Having less meant I was confident I packed the important stuff (crucially, my passport!) even though it was a tight turnaround pack
- I felt free the whole trip, and overall noticed lower stress levels associated with the various transit steps
- There was plenty of room in my bag, which was helpful when my MIL asked me to carry water for her, and when there were funeral items we needed to transport
- All of my clothes were lightweight and quick drying, which was helpful and made me feel confident I could wash them if needed
- Sticking to one pair of shoes seemed like a stretch in theory, but totally worked, and really helped lighten the load
- My bag was small and light enough that I could carry it around as a purse, which meant I didn’t have to worry about leaving luggage anywhere during the funeral 
- Overall, having less helped me be more present and emotionally available, which was the point of the trip
- And there’s still room to lighten!

Thanks to the folks in this community who provided wisdom and inspiration, you’ve really helped me!

I'm a former Roman Catholic who has been attending an Episcopal parish for a number of years with gaps here and there due to health issues. However since the beginning of the year I've been consistent in my Mass attendance, and was volunteering at our weekly food pantry for the local community. Every evening I would pray compline, the Anglican rosary, and listen to hymns before I went to sleep. It was a very peaceful and fulfilling life.

Around March my younger sister began messaging me telling me that her husband was making life intolerable for her. I won't go into details for her privacy's sake, but I can see how she reached that conclusion. I opened my home to her and her three children, my two nieces and nephew, all under 6. I told her I would provide a safe home and take care of financial matters, but things have been much more involved than I anticipated. She desperately needs mental health assistance, but I can't seem to get her to pursue it and I end up spending a good portion of my day caring for the children especially now that she's gone back to school. 
I'm not complaining. I would do it all again tomorrow, but I miss weekly church, being able to socialize at coffee hour, volunteering and helping the community. And by the end of the day I'm so tired that I find it hard to do my old devotions. 

I apologize for complaining. Please pray that I can find a way to attend Mass more regularly, for my family, especially my sister, and that somehow God will use this new way of life to help me grow closer to him. Thank you all, and God bless you.",6,1756181976.0,Episcopalian,4,1.0,False
