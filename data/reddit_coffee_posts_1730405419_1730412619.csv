1ggqec7,https://www.reddit.com/r/adrenalfatigue/comments/1ggqec7/worried_about_phenchromocytoma/,Worried about phenchromocytoma,"Hi everyone. Long time reader, first time writer here. I have exhausted myself reading everything I can on phenchromocytomas. I suddenly starting experiencing this weird sensation over the summer in the center of my chest that feels like a drop or like I went over a rollercoaster. At first I noticed it most after consuming some thc so I thought it was that & have since quit. Then it started happening with coffee so I quit that. Then chocolate & a couple other foods that I seem to react to. I am currently trying to heal my gut but still am getting that sensation. Sometimes it’s more intense than other times & usually is accompanied by me getting hot. My bp usually doesn’t change much & has never been alarmingly high. My pulse rate will go up a little but has only gotten to about 100. It sends me into a panic. I thought it was anxiety but now I’ve been down the road of these phenchromocytomas & am convinced I have it. I also suffer from health anxiety which I’m trying to work on. When these ‘episodes’ happen, a lorazepam helps stop it & meditating makes me feel better. Like it release the energy or something. I am so confused & so scared. I saw new pcp this week & she won’t order the urine test until my ‘basic’ bloodwork comes back. I’m also getting a 48 hour holster monitor put on on Monday. My question is, if it was a phenchromocytoma, would the lorazepam help that or meditating take me out of it or would it persist. I don’t get headaches or excessive sweating or tremors but I do get hot but it goes away shortly after. I am just freaking out & have days to wait. If you’ve read this far, thank you so much. Sincerely, a very worried & anxious mama. Also, I should note that quitting weed was because I thought it was causing it, I smoked pretty regularly for 20 years so idk if this is my brain freaking out & detoxing or something. But like I said, it was happening while I still was so idk. Thanks again. ",1,1730412379.0,adrenalfatigue,1,1.0,False

1ggqb1v,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1ggqb1v/time_looped_chapter_8/,Time Looped (Chapter 8),"Will watched as his friend shattered before his very eyes. Helen had done a good job arriving at the scene in record time, though too good of a job as far as Alex was concerned. The expression of determined vengefulness on her face made the boy glad they were on the same side.

*Knights really do fight well,* he thought.

“Are you okay?” the girl asked.

Given what just had occurred one would think that a small crowd would have started to gather. At least someone should have noticed a girl leaping over a school fence and shattering a boy to fragments of glass. And yet, no one did. People continued to honk, rushing off to some place or other. A local shop worker gave the car lot a general glance, then returned to getting things ready for the day.

“Yeah.” Will tried to move off the spot he was standing. The mirror tile kept on holding him tight.

As he was hesitating whether to try and smash it or not, Helen approached and did just that. On cue, he no longer felt stuck.

“Thanks.” He stepped away. “You got here fast.”

“I’m good at gymnastics,” the girl said, looking at where Alex had been. By now, the glass fragments had all but evaporated as if they had never been.

“Seen anything like this before?”

The girl shook her head. “Are you sure it was Alex?” she asked. “I mean, this wasn’t him, but are you sure he’s the one?”

“Yep.” Will walked up to the mirror pole and tapped it with his hand.

 

**The class has already been found by someone else. Next time, try sooner.**

 

The familiar message appeared on it.

“See?”

“He must have learned some trick.” The boy looked at the ground again. “Or more than a few tricks.”

During his brief speech, the goofball had given Will the impression he had been at this far longer than either of them, possibly even longer than Danny. Catching him was going to be difficult, although Will had gained one huge advantage: he’d found the location of the starting mirror. Still, there was something that didn’t add up.

“Want some mousse?” he turned to the girl.

“What?”

“Chocolate mousse. I know a place.”

Helen tilted her head, arms crossed.

“We’ve got six minutes till the next loop. After what just happened I don't feel like going to class. Why not use the time to chill a bit in a coffee shop?”

The chances of such an offer being accepted were a hundred to one. If this were a date, or there was a chance that it seemed like a date, he’d never be so straightforward. Since it was loop related, and there were only a few minutes left, Will wasn’t going to feel particularly bad if he were shot down.

On her part, Helen, would normally never accept such an invitation. Everything else aside, she liked to know where she’d be going and gathered a few second-hand opinions of the place first. Going to a random coffee shop that served “chocolate mousse” was without question not it. And yet only a minute later both of them were sitting inside, taking advantage of the place’s cocoa.

“Are you sure you’re supposed to be here?” the barista asked with a note of suspicion. “Isn’t it a school day or—”

“First period teacher got stuck in traffic,” Helen interrupted without batting an eye. “We thought we’d go somewhere special.”

“Ah.” The barista nodded, as if the answer made anything clear. “Right. I’ll go check the inventory.” He gave them a sly nod, then discretely wandered off.

“How fast can you get to the parking lot?” Will asked, the moment they were let alone, doing his best to ignore what she had insinuated just then.

“Running, jumping out of windows… ten-fifteen seconds. It’s not that far if you follow a straight line.” She took a sip of her drink. “Straightish.”

“Even after getting the knight?”

“It takes me less than a second to get the knight. I’m already in the bathroom, remember? Wasn’t like that when Daniel was alive. Then, it sometimes took me half a minute.”

“You never said that.”

“Well, excuse me for not discussing things relating to a dead close friend. He wasn’t supposed to die, either.”

Will had an inkling of how she felt, but even so had hoped she’d share such important things. So, a looped’s death caused eternity to change. It sort of sounded logical.

“When you became a rogue, you pulled the loop forward. At least for me. Of course, I did the same thing I did every morning.”

“Get to the mirror and get your class,” the boy said along with her. “That means Alex will be in front of his mirror too.”

There went the idea of catching the goofball by surprise. Still, it was possible to make things uncomfortable for him. It would take Helen fifteen seconds to get there. With a bit of running, Will could reach the spot as well from the other side. Some testing would be required to tell whether it would be faster to get his rogue class first or run directly to the mirror. Either way, it would put pressure on Alex.

“So, that’s your big plan?” The girl didn’t look at all impressed.

“Of course not,” the boy lied. “We know where he starts. We know where he has to be to get Danny’s file—”

“Not that it will do us any good,” Helen uttered beneath her breath.

“We know that…” the boy paused. “A class has three skills, right?”

“Pretty much.”

“I’m serious. Are there any with more?”

“Not that I know of. Daniel said that all the classes were front heavy and started with three at most.”

“Then it’s impossible.”

The girl narrowed her eyes.

“I mean Alex,” the boy continued. “I know one of his skills is to make him faster. I saw that when I chased after the archer. I also know that he can create traps, and we saw that he can make copies of himself.”

“That makes three.”

“How come no one sees him?” Will leaned back triumphantly. “Even if he has a mirror copy of him rushing off to get Danny’s files, how does he get both copies without being seen or raising the alarm? You tried breaking into June’s office. How did that go?”

“Invisibility…” the girl said.

“And lock picking.”

“Please. That’s child’s play. Anyone can pick a lock with a basic set of tools. Daniel taught me how.”

“I still doubt it, but okay. That still makes four skills, which—” the boy raised a finger “—he must have *before* getting to the nurse’s mirror. Otherwise, she’d have seen him as well.” He grabbed his phone from his pocket and started typing a text. “Danny said that there were only four classes at the school, right?”

“Yeah, but he didn’t say anything about outside. There could be more. The parking lot isn’t part of the school either.”

That was true. It was possible that he’d taken a class from elsewhere. If so, that might complicate Will’s plan a bit.

Helen leaned closer to see what he was typing, but the angle remained uncomfortable.

“What are you doing?” she asked.

“I’m texting to Alex. If all goes well, we might not have to fight after all.” The message sent, he put the phone on the table. “We’ll still have to be ready, though. Just in case.”

The girl took the phone. The text read: *Talk after 1 period* , followed by a mirror and hand emoji.

“Mirror and hand?” The girl looked at him.

“Or we’ll break your mirror.”

It wasn’t a very realistic threat, especially considering the nature of the mirror in question. Still, it was a clear threat that they were going to make life difficult for Alex in every loop moving on. The only question was, whether he’d believe them.

With less than a minute left to the end of the loop, the barista returned to check if they wanted anything else. Despite his reluctance, Will ordered a chocolate mousse, telling Helen she had to try it. Before she had the chance, however…

 

**Restarting eternity.**

 

Another loop, another rush through the bathroom. Will didn’t pause to wait for Alex or the daily insult coming from the pair of girls. Getting the rogue right off, he went to the art classroom. Helen was already there, as usual, opening the windows. Silently, the boy assisted, then sat at Daniel’s desk.

One by one, the rest of the class started to arrive. Everyone did the exact same things they had been doing for hundreds of loops. The same jokes, coughs, and nasty comments. Students went to the same places asking the same questions to receive the same answers. In his mind, Will often finished the conversations for them, seconds before they had a chance to do it. Then, something different happened. When the jocks came in, they no longer did so with their usual yell. In fact, they were rather quiet, discussing football strategies. Jace didn’t even pay attention to Will, joining the rest of the group at their desks.

*Huh?* Will thought.

After experiencing the same things so many times, he almost wanted to go to them and start a fight himself. It wasn’t even about extending the loop—he knew precisely what actions he had to do in order to achieve that—but rather out of a sense of tradition.

As for the goofball, there was no notable difference. Ever since he had been discovered, Alex had stopped coming to class, doing his thing elsewhere.

Eight o’clock. The bell rang marking the start of class.

The teacher, barely arrived, told the class to prepare their drawing materials—as he did each loop—then went to close the nearest window. Unexpectedly, the door opened once more. Everyone turned in its direction only to see their very own goofy classmate standing there, carrying a large paper bag of something.

“Should I even ask?” The teacher sighed as his glance fell on the bag Alex was carrying.

“It’s fire, teach!” The boy reached in and took out a muffin. “Muffins, the progressive nature morte!”

The entire class erupted in laughter. Even the teacher found it difficult to remain indifferent. Despite all his other faults, and Will could think of several since the recent revelation, the goofball remained highly amusing.

“While I’m impressed you know the phrase, muffins can hardly be described as a nature morte,” the teacher said once calm was restored.

“But, they’re lit. And I brought enough for everyone.”

“Great. I’m sure your classmates would appreciate that… after class. Until then please put the bag on my desk where it won’t serve as a drawing inspiration.”

Alex shrugged, returned the muffin to the rest, folded the top of the paper bag, then placed it on the teacher’s desk. A few rogue comments followed from other members of class, all attempting to match his humor and failing at it. That didn’t disturb the boy in the least. In his usual swagger, he went straight to Will’s old desk and sat down.

“Brought your muffin, bro,” he whispered as he took out his drawing materials from his backpack. It was subtle, but enough to let him know that the truce had been accepted.

Class continued as usual. Will and Helen finished their assignments first, earning themselves a lot of praise and envy. To everyone’s surprise, so did Alex. Seeing the goofball’s “hidden talent” almost made the teacher get a stroke. It was more than skill, it was mastery that required years of practice to perfect.

While the rest of the class was astonished at the result, Will felt a lump in his throat. Alex was sending him a warning. Being looped for so much longer had also made him a lot more experienced. In both confrontations so far, he had proved to have the upper hand. Although, interestingly enough, not once had he attacked. He could done so have back when Will had no idea what was going on. Helen had, after all, so why hadn’t Alex?

The bell sounded bringing the class to an end.

“And remember,” the teacher said just as everyone started putting away their belongings.

“Practice makes perfect,” the students continued in the most unenthusiastic fashion possible.

“Or something of the sort,” the man said with a smile showing he was accustomed to disappointment. “Alex, Will, I’d like to have a word with you sometime this week.”

“Sure, bro!” The goofball grinned.

“Ok,” Will replied in a quiet tone. If this were outside the loop, he would have been thrilled. Right now, the only thing on his mind was the conversation.

“Great. Oh, and don’t forget your…” The teacher pointed at the paper bag on his desk.

“Nah, keep it, teach. For next time.”

A few bouts of laughter erupted as the people poured out into the corridor.

“Nice sketch,” Helen tore away from her friends. “Must have taken you a while to get the technique right.”

“Nah, bro. I’m lit.” He smiled.

Two of Helen’s friends rolled their eyes, leaving the room with a “don’t take long” glance at her.

“Yard?” Will asked in a whisper.

“Muffin place.” Alex finished packing his backpack. “My treat.”

“Muffin place,” the girl repeated.

It sounded just like something the goofball would suggest. It was also a good move. Open spaces gave him the advantage. Additionally, given that it was his home turf, there was every chance that he had set up a trap or two.

“Fine. Let’s go.” Will tossed the backpack on his shoulder.

“For real, bro?” The goofball arched his eyebrows, surprised.

“If it’s a trap, we can still do what I said in the next loop.” Will paused. “And all the loops after.”

\[no, not exactly *this* medic, just an arbitrary medic on the landship. yes, writing is bad, this thing was *speedrunned*\]

""Right, everything should be in order now...""

Midnight, from Thursday to Friday; another day for ""Sex Reviews"" submissions came to a close. Medical operator stacked the pile of papers and put them into an envelope. This feline was no different from any other on-site medical operators on the ship (of which there were hundreds), except she had one important job: every week she had to print out every single review of every Thursday and bring them to Dr. Kal'tsit for evaluation the next morning. She wasn't told to read them; in fact, she was even discouraged from doing so. She glanced at the terminal's monitor.

""This one sounds ominous..."" - she wrote down the title of the review and name of the author.

While she had a strong curiosity to read one, the memory of Dr. Kal'tsit's face when she was reading one was holding her back. Despite that, she afforded herself to read only one thing in the reviews: ratings made by other operators. And every time, almost like clockwork...

""Ansel - zero points..."" - she muttered to herself, printing out another review.

Recently, Ansel's rating could be seen on each and every one of them, giving either zero or ten points, depending on whether the review was explicit or not. She found it weird - if he didn't like them, why did he keep reading them? The points system was completely arbitrary anyway, Kal'tsit told everyone to rate them ""however they liked"". Some rated the overall narrative and story of the review, others rated the Doctor's state of mind, and Ansel... was giving a fair warning. Anyway, envelope, another review...

""Wait, isn't it..? Right, it's not my job to ask questions..."" - she signed the last review. Now they have to wait for their time in the office. Operator lets out a yawn and closes the door.

...

The next morning, she puts them all into a folder, one by one. Some reviews could appear on the network later than they should, so she always double checked in case she had missed one.

""Wait... One review is missing..."" - she checked the terminal: no signs of the mentioned record. But she remembered how she printed it out...

""...I better report this to Kal'tsit...""

After putting the date on the folder, she now had to deliver it to Dr. Kal'tsit.

...

The door to the office hissed open, making way for the feline medic.

""Good morning, Dr. Kal'tsit.""

""Morning, come in..."" - Dr. Kal'tsit was sitting in her chair. Right beside her were two cups of coffee - it was early morning. She sighed - ""Let's get it over with.""

Kal'tsit opened the folder and started to take out the reviews, one by one.

""Dr. Kal'tsit, there was another work this week but... it disappeared overnight...""

""Its author appeared in my office with a question about whether his work was compliant with 0Sanity's network rules or not. I gave him a short answer and the keys to the office - he should have purged it himself.""

""I see...""

She cut the envelope, examined its contents, wrote something in her paper and set the review aside. And another one. And another one. Sometimes she smirked, sometimes she frowned, sometimes her face cringed so hard she couldn't read the rest of the work, instead marking something in her file. Her hand met with her face once, and, as she was taking a note, she muttered:

""And another one goes to Sami...""

""Something's wrong?""

""No, nothing.""

""...""

""...""

""...Dr. Kal'tsit, why do you not have a 0Sanity account for this?""

""I may not have Sanity as a resource, like Doctors, but I do have it in form of mental and cognitive precaution. I may not lose it in regular sense, but my psyche will suffer some damage if my sanity will have to withstand this for far too long, so I prefer to stay aside from this matter whenever I can, and I advise you to do the same. ""

""But what about other medical operators?""

""They don't have the need to check every single one of them like I do, they can just skip the ones they don't feel comfortable reading.""

""Right...""

""...""

""...""

""Dr. Kal'tsit... Is it really necessary?""

""It's one of few rare opportunities when we can monitor Doctors' mental state in full without actually using brute force. While direct methods are undoubtedly more effective and less straining for me, they are messy and do not exactly fit Rhodes Island's image. Besides, Amiya is strictly against those methods...""

She paused and took a long sip from her mug; operator could feel the strength of the coffee even one desk apart from her. Kal'tsit continued:

""If we know what they're thinking about while being at their lowest, we can accurately predict what they're capable of at their highest. Using this data we can arrange their schedule from here. Some may be able to take command in harder missions, some will require constant monitoring to stop them from slacking off, and some..."" - she paused for a moment, but then shook her head - ""No, there are only two types of Doctors. Anything else should not be too big of a concern.""

Kal'tsit stacked the reviews into one pile and checked her paper:

""Four reviews in total, out of which two should be marked for deletion, and the author of one of them should be prepared for an expedition to Sami. The psychological profiles have been updated; nothing too outrageous, thankfully. We'll put them back into the folder and turn into ash, just as usual-""

""Uhm, Dr. Kal'tsit, there is another review in the folder.""

""Indeed, there is.""

She cut open the envelope, without even checking the title. She was going into it blind, not thinking it could be anything bad. First few sentences were quite normal, before it quickly started to delve further and further into madness. This person no longer had zero sanity, it was in the negatives. She frowned further and further, her eyes were opening more and more in pure disbelief as her pupils were shrinking, trying to save her from this nightmare of a review. It was made by a man who was stuck in the perpetual loop of repeating the same stage again and again and again... Her eyes went faster and faster grazing along the text, no longer recognizing the connection between the forsaken words. Boiling iron rushed onto her face, lighting it on fire for the first time in several years, be it from anger, frustration or embarrassment. The work was riddled with vivid description that could only be produced by the most unhinged of voices in Doctor's mind. It was pure. Unfiltered. Vile... The paper started to crumple under the pressure of Kal'tsit's fingers...

""D-Dr. Kal'tsit... Are you alright..?""

""This is… *beyond* excessive...""

Kal'tsit threw the papers away from her, scattering them in the air. Medic, frightened, began to grab onto the parts of the work - they're not meant to be shared publicly, so leaving even one astray would prove to be troublesome. She was careful enough to not look into the ink, which was neatly arranged into the essence of utter degeneracy itself. Dr. Kal'tsit quickly tapped the phone and pressed it hard against her ear:

""Amiya. Send Mudrock and her team to the Dr. K's office. **Now.**""",0,1730411950.0,0sanitymemes,1,0.5,False

I manage at a Production facility (bakery) that supplies all 9 of our coffee shop/bakeries. 

Currently we make 4-10 batches of scones (~300 scones/batch), all cut and shaped by hand. I'm desperately looking for ways to speed up or automate this system as we spend hours cutting and shaping by hand. We have tried tabling all the dough into an even rectangle and cutting it, however we end up with different thickenesses and sizes depending on which staff table the dough. 

As we cut the scones we weigh them to between 210g-230g, one scone at a time before shaping. 

I feel like there must be some kind of system or something we can do to speed this entire process up.

Etteilla snored softly in the bed, while he had slept atop the wooden floor with only a blanket above him and a pillow under his head. A marked improvement over the rocks and jackets he had been sleeping under the past few days.

*Remember to ask them for a sleeping bag, and to yell at Niccolo for confiscating mine when I left the island. Everything he's done for me, yet he wouldn't let me steal one on my way out. I'm damn lucky he didn't find the bike's mirror.*

He dressed and left the room without waking Etteilla. By the light on the horizon he knew it was six in the morning. He found Diego and Asanina silently eating breakfast downstairs. Asanina still looked half asleep while Diego had clearly gotten none.

""Morning,"" Nerio took a seat facing Asanina, ""Can I have some?""

""You're here aren't you?"" Asanina replied before taking another sip of coffee.

Nerio put a biscuit and a trio of sausage balls on his plate before reaching for the open jar of jelly. He could tell it was cherry from the smell, but he knew what it was from Asanina's presence. She was allergic to strawberries, and she never liked ""that grape shit"" as she called it, ""When are we heading out?""

""An hour,"" Asanina said.

""Soon as the Sun finishes rising,"" Diego interrupted.

*Good luck getting Etteilla up that early.*

A moment of silence passed as Nerio chewed on his meal, ""Niccollo said you had some artefacts you could spare for me. I'm sure he told you about the assassins.""

""I don't, and he did,"" Diego said, ""I owed him a lot, but not enough to give you anything more than a bed.""

""Are you kidding me!? The only reason I'm here is for some protection! I may not be in great standing with the company right now, but I haven't been fired.""

""If the court had any sense you'd be in a much worse state than that."" Diego calmly finished his plate, well aware of the meaning of his words.

Nerio could only stammered out a series of pronouns and ""just""s as the table grew larger.

""What?"" Diego was almost giddy at seeing Nerio so flustered, ""Don't act shocked. Not all of us disagree with the court's decision. How anyone can think you deserve to-""

""Dacian!"" Diego stopped at his real name. It was spoken with a sterness unexpected from such a small old woman, ""We do not speak ill of our guests. Nor do we belittle members of the company.""

Diego petulantly grumbled some insult under his breath, ""I'm still not giving you any artefacts, not unless you gave me something in exchange. Like some information on the woman. Who is she? How did she keep up with a Catalan vehicle? A *stolen* one, I might add.""

*Damn, I'd hoped Niccolo didn't notice that.*

""What's there to say? She's a stranger, I got paired with her at the start, and I had to tell her I was a Catalan because of the teams of assassins sent after us.""

Diego scowled at him, ""We both know she couldn't get that horse down here without some kind of help. She's got something. It sure as hell ain't artefacts or you wouldn't be begging for ours.""

""She doesn't have anything,"" Nerio's voice lowered and angered.

*Belittle your mark and when they're low intimidate the intel out of them. Did you really think I wouldn't recognize a Catalan tactic?*

Diego leaned forward, ""You better start cooperating Nerio. I'm only helping you because Niccolo told me to. The sentencing could come down at any moment, and I don't want to be on the hook for what you do with my weapons.""

""Let the court's judge, Diego. A case like this is often only cause for renegement or firing, not prison. Anyone would have done the same for their friends,"" he visibly recoiled at Asanina's scolding.

Diego remembered he was no longer a school child and returned to his original ego, ""The problem is that they weren't friends. The court's letting that get in the way of their judgment. We know he did it. The fact that they haven't decided his sentence—that they look at who he is and what he's done and are wavering—that disgusts me. Knowing what he is, I wouldn't waver.""

Nerio was quiet, too scared to even reach for more food to fill his hungry stomach. He looked to Asanina for support, but saw only her empty chair.

Diego took advantage of Asanina's absence, ""How many was it that you let die? Six right? Six Catalans killed because of you. *By* you. And you're trying to ask for weapons? They'll just as soon end up in my back as your enemy's.""

*Shut up. Shut up.*

""Hell, even if they don't put you in a prison, once they fire you I'll be sure to be the first one to put a price on your head. Just wish they'd let the bounty maker act as the hunter.""

A loud creak on the stairs stopped Diego's tirade on his lips.

""Good morning,"" Etteilla said. She nervously glanced between the pair of men, ""Oh, don't let me interrupt the conversation, \[Do you want me to break this guy's nose?\]""

Don't rock the boat Etteilla. The last thing I need is more people in the company against me.

""It was already over,"" Nerio didn't use the third arcana to inscribe any further meaning to his words. He had nothing to add, but Ettilla saw more.

He was sunken low in his chair. He stared blankly at his half-full plate, yet his arm remained tight on his chest. He looked smaller than she had ever seen him like he was a moment away from vanishing into nothing.

She grabbed a fistful of sausage balls from the center plate, ""You still need me to help you get your bike ready?""

He blinked and life slowly returned to his body, ""Y-yeah. Thanks for reminding me."" He stood, and Etteilla took the remaining food from his plate before the pair left the room. They stepped on the porch, and Nerio immediately fell into a chair.

Etteilla gave the moment time enough to pass before speaking, ""Are you sure you don't want me to hit him? I'm not with your company, so I don't give a damn about making them mad.""

""I'm fine,"" Nerio lied.

Etteilla stood before him, blocking his view of the rising Sun. His eyes remained unfocused, ""You don't sound fine. Hell, you look worse.""

""It's temporary. Trust me, you get used to it.""

Etteilla eyed the small window in the door. Diego sat alone at the table happily eating his meal, ""There are some things you shouldn't get used to.""

Nerio finally looked at her, ""you also learn to keep some thoughts for yourself, especially when they'll make more enemies.""

""Ugh, you sound like my grandma. At least you aren't old enough to be a lost cause. . . yet."" Etteilla wiped a bit of the cherry jelly from Nerio's stolen biscuit onto her finger and ate the rest.

""Learn what?""

""Sometimes it's okay to stand up for yourself; it's okay to get some revenge.""

""Stand up for myself? I hunt artefacts and shoot people for a living, can't stand much more than that.""

""Stand up for yourself *even* when it's a bad idea, even when the danger is merely social. Observe."" Etteilla drew a circle around the jam with her free hand.

*Which spell was that, the third?*

A fly landed on her jammed finger and took a small bite before walking into her empty palm. She made a fine movement with her hand, some other ritual no doubt, and put her index and middle fingers onto the fly. Surprisingly, the fly calmly accepted the petting.

""That was the communication spell, right? It can talk to animals?""

""It lets you *understand* not talk. This little guy doesn't know a word leaving my mouth; he just knows that if he lands on Diego over there and walks around a bit he'll get this jam.""

""And you want that because?""

The fly returned and Etteilla smeared the jam onto the wall for it, ""The sixty-eighth arcana. It's on the complicated side of spells, so let's just say that he won't be forgetting about the fly any time, well, ever.""

A loud ""Smack"" hit Nerio's ears as Diego slapped his own arm. Nerio's eyes met his through the small window on the door, ""This ain't a house for insects! Shut the damn door!"" Hearing this, Etteilla kindly apologized and gently closed it. All the while a wicked smile rested on her face. For the first time, Nerio was glad he had been stuck with Etteilla. He'd never survive competing against her.

Her sadism satisfied, Etteilla asked Nerio if he was ready to leave. He nodded, and the pair stepped around the corner of the house. There, Etteilla went to the small stables and shrank and sealed Zippy. Nerio found the motorcycle and reached for the bike's mirror.

*Wait, Diego knows I stole it.. he's definitely going to lock it up here to stop it from rebuilding where I am. Shit. I can't take it with me, and there's no way I could keep up with Etteilla on an ordinary bike.*

""Want me to shrink it for you?"" Etteilla asked, no doubt parsing his thoughts thanks to the third arcana. Nerio nodded, and, one casting of the twelfth arcana later he had his motorcycle in his palm. Fearing Diego would notice the missing bike and demand to search him, Nerio gave it to Etteilla to hide within her robe.

They then made their way to the front of the house where they could see Asanina struggling to put half-empty ammunition boxes into her truck.

Her small head peered past the side of the box, ""There you are, I was wondering when you'd get tired of him. Can one of you help me? It seems I'm a bit too old for this part of the job.""

Etteilla helped her heave the box into the truck's bed. Nerio was about to properly introduce the pair when they set it down.

The box lowered, and Etteilla gradually saw more of the old woman's face, ""Jesus Christ!"" Etteilla leapt back and her right arm jumped to her left palm, the fireball ritual she had used to light their camp two nights ago. She took in Asanina's wrinkled visage and relaxed, ""Sorry, you're just so old. I thought you were a goblin.""

Asanina was taken aback by Etteilla's shout and raised a fist to her mouth to stifle a chuckle when she parsed Etteilla's words.

Nerio was mortified, ""I'm so sorry about her. She's. . . vocal.""

""Don't be. I saw you last night, but I don't believe we've been properly introduced. I'm Asanina, I'm a Catalan,"" she held out her hand and Etteilla took it.

""I'm Etteilla, I'm a magician.""

Nerio tightened his lips to stifle a scream \[Don't tell everyone you meet!\].

Etteilla raised an eyebrow, ""Why not? It's not illegal to be a magician. Plus, I'm proud of who I am unlike a certain mercenary that gives weapons to dangerous criminals.""

The three of them made short work of packing the truck. Especially after a quartet of men wearing Stetson hats appeared to help. The four introduced themselves to Nerio, but he didn't bother memorizing any of their names. Once it was finished, the four men climbed into the truck's bed and Asanina told Nerio to sit in the cab with her.

An hour passed, and when Nerio was certain Etteilla wasn't listening he spoke to Asanina, ""Thanks for standing up for me back there.""

""Thanks aren't for the minimum. Surely Rugerro taught you that.""

""I'm sure he did somewhere. How is he?""

""He's doing fine. Teaching keeps him busy, but he's finally taking a break. You can't chain yourself to your job I told him. Never cared to listen to his grandmother. No, he had to wait for the whole damn world to come crashing down and a note from god telling him he can't do a thing about it to even consider a vacation.""

""Really? What finally made him snap?""

""The verdict.""

*Oh.*

""He did everything he could; he kept going to the court even after 'guilty' had been passed down. They eventually got tired of him interrupting their debates on the sentence and barred him from the courtroom. I knew damn well that wasn't enough to stop him. so I told Niccolo to take him to a dinner to ""boost his spirits"" after the news. While they were out I stole his keys, locked his doors, and mailed them to Svalbard.""

""Are you serious? Why Svalbard of all places?""

""I'm always serious. He needed the break. For his sake and your case's. But he's the sort to never take a *real* break. Sending him to Aruba or some other vacation spot would leave him worrying about home more than relaxing. The cold there will give him a challenge to overcome. Work to keep his mind off of work.""

Asanina glanced from the road to find Nerio silently gazing out the window to the blur of vegetation flying past them, ""Don't worry though,"" her words caused him to worry more, ""Rugerro might not be able to defend you to the judges anymore, but *I* can. Do well on this job, and I'll put in every good word I can. Not to mention whatever artefacts we pull from the site.""

""Yeah, I never asked what the job actually was.""

Asanina gave a thin smile, ""You already agreed. Do you really want to spend the next few hours stressing over what you have to do?""

The rear window slid open and Etteilla's head poked through in answer to her question, ""*So*, where are we going?"" She asked. Her tone betraying her eavesdropping.

""Wait, shouldn't we get those guys in on this?"" Nerio motioned to the cowboys behind Etteilla.

The women stared at him, and Etteilla pointed to one of the men. He was sitting on the floor instead of the bench lining the sides of the bed and was repeatedly poking his arm and comparing them. 

""What? He just found out one of his arms is longer than the other. It's normal.""

""They're the same length,"" Etteilla said.

""No, his right arm is clearly at least three centimeters longer than his left. Could be five, but the angle makes. . . What?""

Etteilla looked to the driver, ""Asanina, being the only two normal people here, I don't think we need to share the plan with the rest.""

""Nerio, that was embarrassing. I'm looking through the mirror and I can tell it's no more than four centimeters off.""

This was the seventh time Etteilla regretted being paired with Nerio. Once for each of the two nights he made her sleep outside, once for each of the two mornings he had forced her to wake early, one for cutting her first night in a bed to five hours, and one for the assassins on the train (she didn't regret his help on Navajo Bridge, but he hadn't armed those people. At least, not to her knowledge).

""Back to the subject,"" Asanina began, ""A small sinkhole formed near the Temple of Quetzalcoatl a few days ago. Initial surveys found a tunnel, which we believe goes right under the complex and beneath the temple. A team of archaeologists from the National Autonomous University has already set up a dig site; the company was able to convince the university to delay the excavation until tomorrow. We're going to pose as a geological team testing the stability of the tunnel and retrieve any artefacts that might be hidden there.""

Etteilla nodded, ""So, we're sneaking into an ancient ruin and stealing all the old crap we can find? Er, I mean all the *magical* old crap. Obviously. \[I'm taking anything I can hide in my robe. Nerio, if you tell her about my plan I'll throw your bike out of the window.\]"" Nerio believed her and remained silent.",1,1730411660.0,redditserials,1,1.0,False
1ggq4rs,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1ggq4rs/time_looped_chapter_7/,Time Looped (Chapter 7),"“Hey, Alex!” Will waved the moment the goofball came into view.

Up to now, he’d thought that his friend appeared about ten seconds after the start of the loop. As it turned out, it was closer to half a minute.

“How about we get some muffins?”

“For real?” Alex blinked. This was supposed to be his line. “You into muffins, bro?”

“Everyone’s talking about them, so why not try?”

There was no arguing against that logic. Nonetheless, it still didn’t feel quite right. Despite what Alex claimed, muffins weren’t a real trend. All those talking about them—who were far less than the goofball made people believe—only knew of them through him. Even the corner shop had barely advertised, effectively taking them as a replacement for something else. Thus, the owner was nearly astonished when not one but two students had come before class asking to buy some.

“What flavor would you like?” Spencer asked.

He was a large man with a mustache that had gone out of style in the seventies. The man had been here since Will could remember. In truth, he could almost be considered part of the school. The cornershop was not only the only one on school grounds, but it actually was considered school property. Spencer had made a deal with the previous school administration to transform the small building into a place to sell snacks and drinks in exchange for part of the profit. The arrangement had worked quite well, even if every now and again weird products would make a brief appearance just to be whisked away a week later.

“One of each,” Will quickly said. “For him as well.”

“Bro, I—” Alex began.

“I’m paying.” He ran his phone over the wireless register.

“Two bags, half a dozen each.” The man took a small brown paper bag and started filling it with what looked suspiciously like cupcakes.

“Okay, what’s up, bro?” Alex asked. “You celebrating?”

“Nah. Just decided to start living for a change.”

The other boy narrowed his eyes.

“You ok?” he asked.

Will was just about to say fine when he saw Jace and his group of jocks approach. The timing was terrible. Will hadn’t gotten his rogue skills, making him as defenseless as a balloon in a pin factory. Instinctively, he tensed up.

“Jace, Bro!” Alex said with the suicidal confidence only he was capable of. “What’s up?”

“Beat it, nerds,” the jock replied. “Three cans,” he told Spencer, ignoring the other two boys entirely.

*What the hell?* Will wondered.

In all the loops, they had been so hostile in class, and yet now they didn’t want to have anything to do with him. Jace had every excuse to get into a fight, but instead he couldn’t get the energy drink cans fast enough, disgusted to even be seen in the same place as Alex.

Confused, the boy watched the jocks move away, talking about movies, cars, and movies—in that order. It felt as if this was an entirely different reality altogether.

“Here you go.” Spencer handed the muffin bags with a smile. “Six each. Hope you enjoy. And tell me if you’d like me to order more.”

“Sure thing, Spence!” Alex said, right before biting into one of his muffins without bothering to remove the paper cup. “What you think?” he asked, mouth full.

“I’ll tell you in a bit.” Will kept an eye on the jocks as they moved towards the front of the school.

“Don’t worry about those guys. They’re in a good mood today.”

“How can you tell?”

“My nose isn’t bleeding,” Alex laughed. “You really must try these, bro. They’re lit!”

Will did. After the mousse moments ago, from his point of view, the muffins tasted outright bland. Maybe if he tried them in ten or twenty loops, but even then, there was no guarantee he’d like them.

“Have mine,” he handed the bag to Alex.

“For real?”

“They’re not my thing.”

“Thanks, bro!”

“Yeah…” Now came the information gathering part. “Alex, what have you heard about Daniel?”

“Dead guy?” The goofball chomped another muffing. “Lots of sus stuff. They said he was in some drug program testing crap that can keep you awake all day. Lots of NDAs so his Barents didn’t know and the cops couldn’t ask.”

“Right.” Will had already heard this part. “I mean before that. Was he into anything weird?”

“Why? What have you heard?”

“I’m asking you.”

“Well, he had paper money. That’s mega sus. Who uses paper money?” The boy spat out the paper that came with the muffin, and took yet another. “I think he was in a gang. Like, a real one. He never did any sports, and still could beat up half the football team. That was lit, but also scary. Saw a fight in the gym once. Big oof. They all went at him and he tossed them around like…” he gesticulated, searching for the right word.

“What about him and Helen?”

“Danny and Miss Perfect?” Alex laughed. “Why? What did you hear?”

“She told me they were close.”

That was a bit of an assumption on his part, but not one without merit. Helen hadn’t liked him messing with Daniel’s desk even before she had learned he was looped. The only logical explanation was that they had to be an item. Depending how long the loops had been going on for, it wouldn’t be surprising that they’d become close without anyone else noticing.

“Huh?” Alex almost choked. “No way, bro. Like for real? Nah, no way!”

“Why not?”

“Well… Danny is sus as hell! No rizz, no social life, his grades are worse than mine!” He thought for a moment. “Maybe chicks really dig bad boys?”

“Be serious.”

“I’m serious, bro. Danny was messed up. No way she’d fall for him.”

The comment sounded innocent enough, but Will spotted the nugget of information he had been hoping for. Hopefully, it would be wasting a loop on muffins.

“Messed up how?”

“You know… messed up. Guy was a regular with the school shrink. For real! I saw him there several times per week.”

“You went to the counselor?” Will found that unexpected.

“Hey, it’s not that I need it. It’s just a cool place to hang.”

Everyone Will knew came up with excuses not to go to see the school counselor. He himself had been told so twice since the starting of the loops. At the same time, he could see why his friend would enjoy it. Asking to see the counselor was a certain way to skip any class, no questions asked. He could avoid homework, P.E., even the odd test every now and again. It wouldn’t be a stretch to think that he helped himself to anything edible there as well.

“Danny didn’t like it much. He’d always come out worse than he went in.”

“Did he say what he was there for?”

“Nightmares,” Alex instantly replied. “Told me he kept having nightmares that kept him awake. Must have been pretty bad cause he’d always have them. I think it was a side effect from the meds they were pumping him with. I bet the shrink’s working for big pharma.”

The boy continued with his conspiracy theories, but Will was no longer listening. Thanks to Alex, he knew where he could find some answers. All he had to do was get them.

 

**Restarting eternity.**

 

Unfortunately, as it often happened in life, every solution came with its own set of problems. When Will had gone to the counselor’s office after completing his usual routine, he had found the room to be locked. It had taken him two loops to find out that Mister June had been involved in a traffic accident and would be arriving late. Three more loops were spent finding creative ways to enter the room. There were two sets of spare keys: one held by the janitor, and the other at the principal’s office. The janitor’s set was easy to get, but located too far for Will to make it there and back before the end of the room without attracting attention. In contrast, the set in the principal’s office was merely a few doors away, but not something he was looking forward to.

Twice the boy had tried to break the door open in the hopes of incrementally searching the room. As flimsy as the door was, Will turned out to be flimsier, ending up at the nurse’s office both times. What was worse, his condition prevented him from getting the unknown class even when Helen wasn’t there with him.

After ten unsuccessful loops, and one more spent in the coffee shop to collect his thoughts, and have some free mousse, the boy decided to change approaches again. Since he couldn’t find any leads to what might have caused Daniel’s death, he might as well try and convince Helen without any proof. It was all a matter of timing, correct approach, and very fast reactions.

 

**Restarting eternity.**

 

Holding his backpack like a weapon, Will quickly completed his sequence, then went to the classroom.

“Helen, I—” he began upon entering just to have a desk fly into his head.

 

**Restarting eternity.**

 

Will’s second death was virtually painless. If anything, he felt embarrassed by the whole thing. This was the shortest loop he’d experienced by far. The girl hadn’t even let him explain. By the looks of it, her mind was already made up.

Still dazed by the experience, Will looked around. Everything was just as it had been before, from the pair of annoying girls to the parents dropping off their children. Soon enough, Alex would appear with his standard greeting. For a moment, Will considered dragging him in the whole thing. Maybe going to see Helen with other people would prevent her from charging at him for long enough for him to voice an explanation. On the other hand, it was just as efficient to use the loops to get familiar with her actions and find a counter to it.

That proved to be easier said than done. Suspecting he might do something of the sort, Helen also changed tactics each time. Some loops she’d throw something heavy his way—always from a different position; others she’d wait for him just by the door. The few times he’d managed to make an argument, the girl had completely ignored him, proceeding to crack his neck, or skull respectively. Eventually, it became clear that if Will wanted to make his case; he had to prove he had the strength or will to back it up. For that reason, at his next loop, he decided to play dirty.

“Stone!” the coach yelled as he swung the bathroom door open. “I warned…” his voice trailed off seeing the boy soaking wet. “What the heck happened here?”

One of the sink faucets was broken, spraying water all over the place.

“It just broke off!” Will lied.

“Things don’t just break!” He rushed in, under the common illusion that his presence would somehow make the flow of water stop. It didn’t. “Don’t just stand there! Get out of there!”

The yells quickly attracted a small crowd, which grew even larger when Will took off his shirt. The action wasn’t shocking or even mildly scandalous, but given the strict dress code, many were wondering what was going on.

“Someone get the janitor!” the coach shouted.

While people were recording everything with their phones, Will kept an eye out for Helen. And surely enough, she appeared, emerging from the art classroom as if nothing had happened.

“Coach!” Will shouted. “I think Helen and I should go tell the principal.”

“What do you want? A written request?” the coach yelled at him. “Just do it.”

This was the moment of truth for this loop. If Helen decided to play along, they would have some uninterrupted time to discuss things. That was unless she decided to go all destructor in the school hall.

*Don’t go crazy.* Will kept repeating in his mind. *Don’t go crazy.*

The two glanced at each other. Hatred still filled her eyes. There was no other emotion anywhere on her face, as if she were wearing a mask of marble.

“Let’s go,” she said at last.

In his mind, Will let out a sigh of relief. The two walked along the hallway to the staircase. Students everywhere stared at them—more specifically at the boy, who was still shirtless and mostly wet.

“You can’t win against me,” Helen whispered.

“I just want to talk,” he quickly said. This was a once in a twenty-loop opportunity and he didn’t want to waste it. “I didn’t kill Danny.”

“You have his class.”

*People were assigned classes?* “I got it in the guys’ bathroom over a week after—”

“Liar!”

“I’m telling the truth! Who’d want to be trapped in this hell reliving ten minutes over and over again?”

Helen stopped mid step.

“Ten minutes?” she asked, looking at him. “You’re still at ten minutes?”

“Yeah… I got to fifteen once, but… Why, what’s it mean?”

“You really don’t know, do you?”

“That’s what I’ve been trying to tell you. I tapped a mirror in the bathroom one day, then all this happened. I’ve been trying to figure out how things work since then. The loops, the rogue, the mirrors… Daniel…”

Mentally, he tensed up as he said the last. This was the final test. If this didn’t set her off, little else would.

“And you didn’t kill Danny?” the girl asked.

“I barely knew him.”

“If you’re lying, I’ll make your loops hell. Okay?”

This wasn’t the result Will was hoping for, but he nodded nonetheless. It was something, at least.

“Meet me in class next loop. I’ll tell you the basics.”

I travel a fair amount for work but have a job where I need to still be productive for my other workloads; going from a comfortable office at a perfect (for me) temperature to the small laptop and varying hotel or coffee shop environments drops my productivity to essentially zero.

My productivity comes in very intense waves where I can knock out 10 hours of uninterrupted, high quality work if the conditions are right. Have never experienced it anywhere other than the comfort of my home office, or staying late at the office with nobody around so i can get fully comfortable. It's made me at times incredibly effective, and that work will carry me through bouts where I can't get very productive. That said, being inconsistent is incredibly exhausting when you can see everyone around you gets frustrated with your variable output.

This is gonna be a bit of a vent session, so buckle up. I grew up in a tiny town out here in rural Pennsylvania. You know the type - one stoplight, everyone knows everyone's business. The Catholic Church is basically the center of everything.

For most of my life, I just went along with it. But lately, things haven't been sitting right with me. I started questioning some teachings, and well, let's just say the answers I found weren't what I expected. So, I decided it was time to step away from the Church.

Now, you'd think that would be the end of it. Nope. The whispers started. Sideways glances at the grocery store. Cancelled coffee dates with old friends. It feels like the whole town is judging me.

But the weirdest part? It's happening on the airwaves too. I'm a licensed amateur radio operator, a ham as they call us. It used to be a great escape, connecting with people all over the world. Lately, though, I keep hearing static bursts and cryptic messages whenever I try to reach out on my usual frequencies. It's like someone's jamming my signal or messing with my equipment.

Maybe I'm just paranoid, but it all feels connected. Like leaving the Church has made me a target. I don't know what to do anymore. It's hard to be yourself when everyone's watching, judging, and maybe even trying to silence you.

Anyone else here dealt with something similar? How did you navigate leaving the Church in a small town? Any advice for dealing with potential harassment on the airwaves?

Would love to hear from you all. Feeling pretty isolated right now.

I (25F) got married about 6 months ago, and my best friend (23F), whom I was extremely close to, felt really bad and cried a lot at the time considering that I'll be too busy with my new life, which is very understandable. 

Since after my honey moon, I've been trying my best to spend time with her. I would invite her over or visit her about once a week. However going out daily like our pre-marriage routine has become nearly impossible for me to achieve. Since then (about a month and a half into my marriage) she started making many friends every month from her regular coffee shop, university or even online and I can see that they're friendship is becoming stronger as time goes by.

Now seeing that makes me feel extremely jealous, as if she no longer enjoys my company and my stories have become too bland for her, or that I started developing different hobbies (baking and gardening). I know I can't confront her because if anything it will only suffocate her and make her feel obligated to spend time with me, which is not what I want.

I still love her and see her as my best friend but I'm starting to notice that I might not be hers anymore. 
The other day she wanted to play it takes two ( a two player game) and we did for a few days, I wake up the next day she's playing it with someone else and we haven't even finished ours. Have I become too boring? Do I just pretend to not care and move on or did I do something wrong? Do I just go on about my life and make new friends? 
I don't want to force myself in places I'm not wanted. 

I know it can sound like a silly question, but I've lost too many friendships for no reason and I'd like to at least keep the one genuine friendship I've ever had. 
Thank you in advance. ",1,1730411156.0,FriendshipAdvice,2,1.0,False

I literally started this job last week.
Today I am training at the cash register to be able to take orders and I see a customer coming towards me.
I greet him and I initially try to find one of the shift managers because I don't want to miss his order since I am not yet familiar with the order taking system and all).
There is one of the managers who wants me to take the order anyway. I take the customer's order, he chats a little bit, I answer and smile. He orders a coffee and gives me some coins.

I keyed in his order on the system but the real problem is the coins( A “me-issue”to be honest) I have difficulty counting the ""decimal"" coins properly (0.25/0.50/0.05 that kind of thing).
And when the customer sees me ""struggling"" he says:
""You guys in Africa you don't use coins ? »
I looked at him for 2 minutes. To make sure I heard correctly. That’s like I tried to process the information to be sure I heard it right. Almost like « no, I can’t be victim of racism ». Denying what is happening but I end up accepting reality. The shift leader next to me heards it very well she acted as if both happened. She saw me freez but was more interested in taking the order and even blame me for being confused.
When I come back to my senses, I tell the guy that his remark is racist. He doesn't react and leaves (I don't know if he didn't hear me or  heard me but still choses to ignore me).
Once the guy left, I confronted the shift leader. And she downplayed it «  Meh it happens. It is not good but that’s life ». I confronted her again about that and she started laughing about it, and downplayed it even more. Like this thing was just a silly joke and I am being angry for no reason. Once she realized that I was angry and wouldn’t let it slide, she stopped laughing and didn’t say anything else. 

I was so mad. I didn’t say anything and left. I was about to cross the door and the manager saw me. She asked me if why I seem so angry. 
I explained her what happened and she said that if something like that happens in the future, she wants me to report it to her and she will handle it. 

I am so annoyed. 
I went through so many emotions. « Do I cry ? No I am 26, I am too old for that. That’s the reaction of a toddler »/«  I should have made a scene, I shouldn’t have wait to put this guy in his place »/«  That’s my fault for accepting to work in this place »

The worst feeling was the fact that people acted as if it was nothing, as if I am blowing it up out of proportion. Almost like what happening happened in my head and I am mentally ill for seeing an issue with it. 

I felt like shit.

This said, we met about 6 days ago online on LinkedIn discussing a few business and political topics in the comment section of a post. She then then told me via personal message that she wants to get know me as a ""private person"" not in a professional context.  
So we agreed on a date / meeting for today at 11am in a coffee bar (3 hour train ride away for me one way!) and talked there for over two hours about everything from each others life (childhood to what each of us is doing today), incl. about past trauma, life aspirations and even talked about sex. Hence we shared a lot of very private stuff for a first date.  
Yet in the middle of the date/meeting she mentioned that she has a partner but then also immediately asked me what I want from a relationship. So I told her that I am looking for serious relationship which however could be an open or poly relationship. After I said that she immediately responded that she and her partner are currently, slowly opening up their relationship.

1ggpob7,https://i.redd.it/pely5mqfu5yd1.jpeg,I have a theory about Max Medina...,"I was never really into Max... he always bugged me. I could probably list the reasons, but even without reasons I just got a weird vibe  about him. That said... what would drive Lorelai to leave him right before the wedding and have no desire to talk about it?

In my most recent rewatch, it dawned on me... Max has been manipulating her from the very moment they met. 

1. Lorelai declines his offer to date because she's uncomfortable dating her daughter's teacher. Max's response is to coerce her into a coffee date that he says is not a date.

2. Lorelai dates him and when Max starts bonding with Rory on a more personal level, Lorelai freaks out. She wants to break up with Max but avoids him instead. When she actually comes to him and can't get the words out, Max gets angry. Then he basically tried to make out with her after she actually admitted she wanted to break up. 

3. Lorelai finally decided that breaking up isn't the answer and she wants to be with Max. She then tells this to Max who (for all intents and purposes) breaks up with her because his reputation and job were on the line ... things that he and Lorelai discussed BEFORE and originally dismissed without a second thought. He breaks her heart for the very reasons Lorelai didn't want to date in the first place, at the exact moment Lorelai is ready to fully commit to their relationship. 

4. They later get back together which leads to their eventual engagement... which was first brought up when they were fighting. Lorelai made an excellent point that suggesting marriage (for the first time) should not be brought up as a serious option during an argument and that it should be a grand gesture. Max's response is to take the exact gesture that Lorelai described and use it to propose to her shortly after. It's like she told him the secret to coercing her into marriage, and he used it to reel her in, because by doing exactly what she, Max puts her in a position where she will now feel guilty for saying no to him.

5. When Max moves in with Lorelai and Rory for a weekend to try things out, his first response to Rory and Dean being out late is to try to control Rory. Instead of just having a thoughtful discussion about his role as step-dad, he gets upset with Lorelai for shutting down.

The day Lorelai left with Rory to go on that road trip makes total sense to me, because any time Lorelai tried to confront Max, it always ended with Max somehow coercing her into moving forward in their relationship, or Max making her feel guilty for how she felt. Even when they met up again, Max blames Lorelai for them making out again, and Lorelai was drawn to him because she always sought him out after he manipulated her so many times. She looked to him for some kind of closure and all Max could do was kiss her and then make her feel bad about it later...",3,1730410365.0,GilmoreGirls,4,1.0,False

I used to play music with friends as a vocalist. Recently, I've been having movie nights with one of my best friends, enjoying new movies and showing him some he's never seen.

I've also been hanging out at my local game store recently. I met a bunch of cool people there, and I enjoy playing TCGs such as Magic: The Gathering, Yu-Gi-Oh, and Pokémon.

Her boyfriend (m41) usually spend time at the flat with us and we all get along pretty well. Also my boyfriend and my friend’s boyfriend have been friends for over 30 years.

The issue has arisen when my friend’s boyfriend has begun to spend an increasing amount of time at our living room. Every morning when we get up, he’s there in the sofa, smoking and having his morning coffee. 

Whilst we are not bothered about him spending time at the flat, he has also started working remotely from the dinner table at our flat so it feels like we never get a moment of solitude in the living room because he is always there. I would say he sleeps, dinners and works from home 5 out 7 days a week.

This has started happening since he’s got a new job, so I get he’s spending more time so he gets to spend more time with his gf, but I also feel it’s unfair we’re having to be uncomfortable in our own home when someone’s using like they’re lodgers, but aint contributing the bare minimum.

Is it reasonable to ask him to contribute towards the home? Or at least work from his girlfriends room?

1ggpfr7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harlem/comments/1ggpfr7/some_east_harlem_love/,Some East Harlem love ,"Hi guys! Just wanted to share my perspective on living in East Harlem for the past year or so. I feel like there isn’t as much East Harlem neighborhood representation on the internet, and the representation that there is seems pretty negative. I wanted to share my perspective for someone who chose to live here and is thrilled to do so. 

For context, I’m a native New Yorker, gay, and POC who moved back after a few years working in another state and purchased an apartment in East Harlem. 

Can I tell you something - a year later and I’m still excited to be in this neighborhood! It feels like I used a cheat code to able to live in Manhattan.

I have so much to say so I’ll try and organize my thoughts and start with this: 
The thought process around choosing this neighborhood to purchase in for my return was - okay, I would need to be able to travel both downtown and uptown for work a few times a month (I work in health care) and felt like Manhattan over Brooklyn neighborhoods with name recognition would allow me significantly more options. 

Now Let’s talk: 

Real Estate: 
-Of course, there are great homes all over the city, but what made EH stand out was the sheer size of the apartments at the price point. My goal was to get as much as I could for under a million (respect to all and not trying to sound crass by bringing up numbers) I was spoiled by out of state living where space and amenities are a dime a dozen but can be hard to find in NYC. I did not compromise on a single thing I wanted - over 1200 square feet, two beds and two baths, washer dryer, outdoor space, and multiple southern and northern exposures in a great boutique building. HOA less than a thousand on a gorgeous, tree lined block. 

When I check all of the filters for everything mentioned above on Zillow or RedFin or street easy, there are so many specifically in this neighborhood. 

Transportation: 
So East Harlem is primarily served by the 456 trains, specifically the 6 train. I’m on 116th street and the stop is perhaps a 7 min walk from my house. Not too shabby in the grand scheme of things. 

If I need to get downtown quickly, I realized I could take the 6 train uptown to 125th and take the express from there. I know 125th has a bad rap but really, as a new Yorker are you really getting in as much trouble out there as the internet says you will end up in? Of course not. 125 is turning into a beautiful thoroughfare with tons of glamorous apartments and shopping.  

Also, what a gift to have the select bus M15 on second avenue. If I have to travel downtown, those are the two main modes of transport I’d use. With the M15 (select or not) it’s either a 4 or 6 minute bus ride to the UES (4 min to 96th, 6 min to 86th). 

m60 to LGA is 15 minutes from 125th street. 

And then…I discovered taking the M15 to the Q train on 96th street. After a 4 min bus ride I suddenly have rapid access to the UES, 20 min to time square, 30 min to Penn station, Hell’s Kitchen, Chinatown, and Brooklyn?! I really feel like I hit the jackpot. 

Also, they started breaking ground on the new Q train extension, which will have stops at 106, 116 and 125th. It’ll take a while, I’m sure, but I’m hopeful and already able to get around pretty nicely. 

Dog stuff: 
There’s a great dog clinic called ‘Oliver’s Dog and Cat clinic on 115th. We adore the vet. Also, the park on 114th has a dog run and a grassy area for your little guy to run around in. Also so many great, affordable (read: non Manhattan priced) groomers in the area. 

East River esplanade: 
From the park mentioned above, you can walk over the FDR to get to the East river esplanade. Not only are they redoing the EH river walk in 2025 but it’s great as is to bike down the East side of Manhattan, across the water to Randall’s island and beyond. 

Food: 
Big Mexican presence, which is delicious and fascinating. There’s a smattering of old generation Italian spots, soul food, Indian and tons of bakeries. The iconic patsys,  contento, amor Cubano. A speakeasy just opened on 116th called the terrace which is super underground glam. If you need more, take that 4 min M15 to the UES for glamorous restaurants or groceries. The UES becomes your extension neighborhood. 

This might need an addendum post at some point but I wanted to just mention safety. People are uncomfortable with project buildings. But you know who lives in project buildings? Just regular people living lives like in any other building. It’s literally fine. I’ve never had a problem or seen anything but I’m sure if you carried yourself well you’d decrease the odds of anything bad happening. There’s a lot of older families who are sweet and kind and now a lot of young professionals are joining the fun up here. All the neighborhood natives are so kind and are helpful and supportive. Very old New York. 

Did I mention the Costco, Aldi, Whole Foods, Trader Joe’s at both 125th and the UES? Or if you’re in a rush, 4 mins away by bus on the UES. 

Don’t forget great coffee shops like Don Alejo, Cafe Azalea, el Barrista,Aroma, Dell Aria….

Is bud your thing? How about queer WOC owned Betty Budz? How about a bud cafe called lambs wool? Need more glam? Take that m15 down…

Anyways, just wanted to spread some positivity. I feel so fortunate to live here. And am thankful for everything I’ve discovered and learned about the area. Things work out the way they are supposed to, you know? 

Just appreciate your hood even if the rest of the world doesn’t see its value…yet. ",8,1730409735.0,Harlem,1,0.9,False

**LOS ANGELES, CA, October 31, 2024 —** ALFRED PETS, INC envisions a world where pet care aligns with environmental sustainability. Its latest product, ETICAT+, redefines cat litter by using recycled coffee grounds, offering a green alternative to traditional litters. With Kickstarter as its launch platform, the company is excited to share this eco-friendly solution with a global audience.

Designed with cats' sensitive sense of smell in mind, ETICAT+ prioritizes odor control and cleanliness. Traditional litters, like bentonite clay, contribute to environmental degradation, while other options often fall short in clumping, absorbency, or odor control. ETICAT+ tackles these issues by absorbing 99.5% of ammonia odors through the natural, porous structure created during coffee roasting. Additionally, upcycled pulp by-products enhance clumping and absorbency, providing an effective, sustainable option for cat owners looking to reduce their ecological footprint.(Cont...)

1ggpa6c,https://www.reddit.com/r/SIBO/comments/1ggpa6c/mindset_education_and_food_enjoyment_for_the_win/,"Mindset, education, and food enjoyment for the win!","Hey team!

Firstly what an unreal group where I have learned a ton and gained invaluable support dealing with SIBO.

Although I’m not quite out of the woods (haven’t retested) I’m feeling somewhat normal since the summer where SIBO and leaky gut symptoms were killing me.

My strategy was the usual protocols not wheat, dairy, sugar, coffee, etc and I did two rounds of antimicrobial tinctures then after continued weight loss one round of Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole aka Septra or Bactrim (in USA?).  Of course I also cut out raw foods and followed a more or less low FODMAP diet that I wasn’t strict with but did only eat foods that made me feel half decent.What a wild ride of symptoms from die off and fatigue.  I also have three young kids that still want to be chased down the street on bikes and spend 30 min on trampoline so this was intense.

So after that in my mind I’m done killing things in my body.  And my new mindset is that I’m now in rebuilding and reintroduction mode. 

Yes you read that correctly my new mindset is that I DONT HAVE SIBO ANYMORE.

I do feel that for healing to take place we need to reorient our attention to how amazing our body is and that it can and will adapt and heal.

So now in low and slow fashion I have started reintroducing ALL foods slowly and have been cycling different prebiotic fibre supplements (phgg, soaked flax/chai, ground flax, ground flax/ground fenugreek seed).  Motility is increasing.

Exercise and jumping moving yoga whatever every day in morning.  Meal spacing basically two main meals with a handful of nuts for snack mid day.  

EDUCATION.  It has been fun to fuel my mindset with some great books.  Fibre Fueled has been my favourite.  The good gut also was great.  Gut Check was ok but there was a lot of fear mongering and open ended assumptions about reasons for disease that left me uneasy.  A quick Google search showed the author is a bit of a quack.  My top pic is food as medicine by Todd Caldecott who is a herbalist and Ayurvedic practitioner because the recipes are amazing and I love using all kinds of spices and fermented foods!  Just finished a pot of the kitchari (fermented mung beans/brown rice spiced soup/congee).

Learning has been a big reminder that our guys can adapt and we can literally “flex” our digestive powers by testing them bit by bit to regain health.

SLEEP/REST

luckily of love yoga and have been doing more and especially focusing on relaxation and even just taking savasana daily is a game changer.  Also getting to bed early waking early is helpful on top of the minimum 12-14hr fast every day (6pm-8am sometimes until 10am).

Anyways there is always a light in the dark and as much as having an angry tummy sucks optimism and a healing mentality is super helpful to overcome any ailment.

So here I am one year post full shoulder reconstruction almost back to pushups and chin ups and handstands and 4months post SIBO diagnosis and feeling pretty grateful for this group and the wealth of knowledge and experience.

Holla at me if you have any great books or resources for food reintroduction post SIBO or simply what worked for you post Sibo.

1ggp72m,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNYC/comments/1ggp72m/some_east_harlem_love/,Some East Harlem Love ,"Hi guys! Just wanted to share my perspective on living in East Harlem for the past year or so. I feel like there isn’t as much East Harlem neighborhood representation on the internet, and the representation that there is seems pretty negative. I wanted to share my perspective for someone who chose to live here and is thrilled to do so. 

For context, I’m a native New Yorker, gay, and POC who moved back after a few years working in another state and purchased an apartment in East Harlem. 

Can I tell you something - a year later and I’m still excited to be in this neighborhood! It feels like I used a cheat code to able to live in Manhattan. Dare I say a hidden gem? 

I have so much to say so I’ll try and organize my thoughts and start with this: 
The thought process around choosing this neighborhood to purchase in for my return was - okay, I would need to be able to travel both downtown and uptown for work a few times a month (I work in health care) and felt like Manhattan over Brooklyn neighborhoods with name recognition would allow me significantly more options. 

Now Let’s talk: 

Real Estate: 
-Of course, there are great homes all over the city, but what made EH stand out was the sheer size of the apartments at the price point. My goal was to get as much as I could for under a million (respect to all and not trying to sound crass by bringing up numbers) I was spoiled by out of state living where space and amenities are a dime a dozen but can be hard to find in NYC. I did not compromise on a single thing I wanted - over 1200 square feet, two beds and two baths, washer dryer, outdoor space, and multiple southern and northern exposures in a great boutique building. HOA less than a thousand on a gorgeous, tree lined block. 

When I check all of the filters for everything mentioned above on Zillow or RedFin or street easy, there are so many specifically in this neighborhood. 

Transportation: 
So East Harlem is primarily served by the 456 trains, specifically the 6 train. I’m on 116th street and the stop is perhaps a 7 min walk from my house. Not too shabby in the grand scheme of things. 

If I need to get downtown quickly, I realized I could take the 6 train uptown to 125th and take the express from there. I know 125th has a bad rap but really, as a new Yorker are you really getting in as much trouble out there as the internet says you will end up in? Of course not. 125 is turning into a beautiful thoroughfare with tons of glamorous apartments and shopping.  

Also, what a gift to have the select bus M15 on second avenue. If I have to travel downtown, those are the two main modes of transport I’d use. With the M15 (select or not) it’s either a 4 or 6 minute bus ride to the UES (4 min to 96th, 6 min to 86th). 

m60 to LGA is 15 minutes from 125th street. 

And then…I discovered taking the M15 to the Q train on 96th street. After a 4 min bus ride I suddenly have rapid access to the UES, 20 min to time square, 30 min to Penn station, Hell’s Kitchen, Chinatown, and Brooklyn?! I really feel like I hit the jackpot. 

Also, they started breaking ground on the new Q train extension, which will have stops at 106, 116 and 125th. It’ll take a while, I’m sure, but I’m hopeful and already able to get around pretty nicely. 

Dog stuff: 
There’s a great dog clinic called ‘Oliver’s Dog and Cat clinic on 115th. We adore the vet. Also, the park on 114th has a dog run and a grassy area for your little guy to run around in. Also so many great, affordable (read: non Manhattan priced) groomers in the area. 

East River esplanade: 
From the park mentioned above, you can walk over the FDR to get to the East river esplanade. Not only are they redoing the EH river walk in 2025 but it’s great as is to bike down the East side of Manhattan, across the water to Randall’s island and beyond. 

Food: 
Big Mexican presence, which is delicious and fascinating. There’s a smattering of old generation Italian spots, soul food, Indian and tons of bakeries. The iconic patsys,  contento, amor Cubano. A speakeasy just opened on 116th called the terrace which is super underground glam. If you need more, take that 4 min M15 to the UES for glamorous restaurants or groceries. The UES becomes your extension neighborhood. 

This might need an addendum post at some point but I wanted to just mention safety. People are uncomfortable with project buildings. But you know who lives in project buildings? Just regular people living lives like in any other building. It’s literally fine. I’ve never had a problem or seen anything but I’m sure if you carried yourself well you’d decrease the odds of anything bad happening. There’s a lot of older families who are sweet and kind and now a lot of young professionals are joining the fun up here. All the neighborhood natives are so kind and are helpful and supportive. Very old New York. 

Did I mention the Costco, Aldi, Whole Foods, Trader Joe’s at both 125th and the UES? Or if you’re in a rush, 4 mins away by bus on the UES. 

Don’t forget great coffee shops like Don Alejo, Cafe Azalea, el Barrista,Aroma, Dell Aria….

Is bud your thing? How about queer WOC owned Betty Budz? How about a bud cafe called lambs wool? Need more glam? Take that m15 down…

Anyways, just wanted to spread some positivity. I feel so fortunate to live here. And am thankful for everything I’ve discovered and learned about the area. Things work out the way they are supposed to, you know? 

Just appreciate your hood even if the rest of the world doesn’t see its value…yet. ",4,1730409069.0,AskNYC,1,1.0,False

**Memory Transcription Subject: Tren, Victorious General of the THUMR Rebellion**

*Date (Standardized Human Time): January 24th, 2137*

It was almost done. We had made the last of the Farsul surrender, disarmed every weapon, and even captured the Director of this whole place. We had won. And now, we get to deal with the aftermath of our coup.

I looked over the crowd that had gathered by the entrance. They saw me as their leader, the one who knew what to do. And I had been told that my leadership and personality were the reasons I was down here. But despite these praises, I didn’t get it. 

I wasn’t someone special, how could I be? I didn’t start this with the goal of an active rebellion, I had wanted to just lash out for being trapped here. I didn’t give orders to take charge, just didn’t want any of my other companions to stay imprisoned either and people listened to me when I talked.

I pushed the Farsul Director to keep walking.

A leader. I didn’t want to keep being that. Even if I organized things, I’m just a mining rig operator. I loved these machines, the whirring of motors, and the weight of a good haul. If we hadn’t been imprisoned, I would *keep* being that. Send messages to my family, talk to Vellik, then maybe retire and grow my own backyard farm, spoiling any grandpups as much as I could.

But here I was, guiding a Farsul to an elevator, the leader of a rebellion, and father to none.

I kept my feet moving.

… Vellik…

My tail went limp and my ears fell as I thought of my son. The messages… the *bombing*… I barely gave myself a moment to think of anything beyond the fight since reading those messages.

I hadn’t thought of him since then. Our fights, our separation, his mother’s death… it all started hitting me at once. Each footfall felt heavier than the last, the weight of my weapon a thousandfold to what it was before. To know I’ll never see him again, never apologize for what was said, or see him grow into his own Venlil…

Because of *them*.

My paw’s digit reached the trigger, and for a moment, time slowed.

I considered it.

For just one moment, I thought it, here and now. Why should they get a proper trial? What use would it be? Why should they get to live when so many innocents were wiped out because of their war? Their schemes? Their *lies*?

The Director turned her head back to me, her mouth opening to speak. 

“I’m sorry,” came her quivering voice.

“No you’re not,” I growl, pistol shaking in my grip.

“I… I know I can’t convince you to believe it. I won’t waste your time. But I want to thank you for not killing all of my staff.”

“Hmph, sure. At least one of your kind has some kind of twisted sense of right and wrong.”

“... I can’t fault you for thinking that. But… What’s happening here… Venlil Prime isn’t the only planet with a bunker like this.”

“... what?” I say, barely able to contain my shock.

“Every species’ homeworld has one. A contingency in case the Kolshians became… too zealous in their paranoia. A failsafe to ensure the existence of other species. I’m not trying to justify what we did here to you, I only want our reasoning to be known. We never wanted this war, this eradication of intelligence.”

“Why tell me?” I flicked my ears back. “And why say you never wanted to eradicate intelligence when the whole point of this place was to keep us from figuring things out that were already known by your kind?”

“To keep things in order. If one species were to outpace the Kolshian-Farsul alliance in technology, the Kolshians would reason Predator Disease as the culprit behind a disparity in technology. There’d be chaos, war, and destruction across the Federation. What we did was to ensure stability. Keep everyone on one level field to make the Kolshians happy, and ensure compliance.”

My ears fell flat. “That is the dumbest thing I have ever heard. And frankly, it makes you look even more stupid than I thought.”

Her eyes went to the floor, tail tucking around her artificial leg as her ears hung limp.

“If someone is going to fight and kill people just because someone was smarter in some way, or had some tech, that’s like a pup fighting someone just because they got a shinier data pad.” I huffed, “you don’t act like that kid is right, that’s entitlement.”

“When the pup is flinging around millions of drone ships at anything they perceive as a threat, there’s not much else we can do. The Kolshians’ paranoia has kept them pumping war machines out for \[a thousand years\]. We thought no one could fight them.”

“Except that’s what we are doing right now,” I countered, “and for all this talk of the Kolshians, take a moment and think about what the Farsul did. What *you* did. Do you even know? Or are you still going to talk about how imprisoning us away from our families was a good thing?”

“I… I know, what we did… what we’re doing, is wrong. I just… I kept telling myself it was for the greater good, that we were the good guys for actually secretly caring. But…I remember how they treated him. My assistant. My coworkers, the other Farsul, they got violent with him. Extremely so. They believed he was the one giving information about our operations to your movement. Apparently he had a bottle of alcohol produced in Sector 20, one given to him long ago, and they used that as evidence. I thought… they were going to k-kill him. I couldn’t… couldn’t help him, or stop them. I could only watch.”

Her ears were flat on her head now. “They didn’t care about him, not as a-a person. Someone who had people who would miss them. They… *we,* we thought we were superior. And doing what we did just to keep feeling that way. And I’m no better than the people who were beating my friend. It’s my fault you were all ripped from your families. Kept away from those who care. I just… I hope I can do more to make up for what I have done. Even if I die before ever coming close. I need to try.”

My arm burned as the gun in my hand felt like a thousand tons of nuclear waste, the radiation of conflict beating through every atom in my body. My paw’s digit was still on the trigger, and it felt like a brick stuck in place. In spite of it all, of everything she’d done to us, everything we’d endured, all the fighting I’ve gone through…

I can’t kill her.

My mind can’t decide if it’s because I’m too strong to execute a sad older woman who's given up her life in my paws, or if I’m too weak due to \[centuries\] of indoctrination, and I couldn’t break the chains of this mindset. Or if it was as simple as having seen so much death already that I didn’t want to see another, even from an enemy. Speh.

“Just… open the door,” was all I could muster.

Her tail signed a miniscule signal, obeying the order. Walking up to her desk, she pressed a paw on the scanner and initiated the override. 

All around us, the whirring and clanking of machinery rang out as the lockdown finally lifted after months. Windows were slowly exposed once more, revealing the dark icy waters beyond. There were likely doorways and de facto jail cells being unlocked station wide, and the cheers of hundreds of newly freed people cried out from all sectors. 

It was over. After so many months, our own little war was over. We’d won.

From the office window, I could see the machinery shifting within the elevator shaft, and the terminal pinged with live footage from the topside facility. 

“The humans and their allies are waiting for confirmation,” Shalleen said.

I stepped forward to the console, breathing in to calm myself. I pressed the button.

“Humans. The elevator is open, and the Farsul are disarmed. We are putting a lot of trust in you, so please do not abuse it.”

With a flick of the ear, I signaled for Shalleen to authorize the elevator, and with the push of a button, the path to the surface was finally opened up again.

\\/

As the elevator made its achingly slow descent into the facility proper, I escorted Shalleen back to the holding pen, and made my way to the elevator bay. A massive crowd had formed, mostly beds filled with injured and bloodied people, ready for medical assistance. Those that could stand, however, all turned to me again, and cheered. 

I didn’t want to hear more of this, so I put up my paws and motioned for them to calm down.

“Please, there’s no need for that. We have more important things to worry about. Namely, our inbound… guests,” I said, wracking my brain for the right words. “These humans… they’ve apparently been on Venlil Prime for \[several months\], but they haven’t done any harm to us. In fact, these Predators, shockingly, are our allies out there.”Distress and panic ripped through them in a moment, but I smacked my tail against the floor to draw their attention. I grimaced in pain, my tail stinging from slapping the hard metal. Maybe I should have thought of a better way to grab their attention.

“I understand this is terrifying for all of us! But these humans… I’ve seen the footage. They’re dedicated to doing good, doing the right thing, even if it puts them at risk. My son… m-my son, Vellik, had made friends with one. If he can see past their nature, and become friends, then we can be allies. I’m not asking you to do anything drastic, just cooperate. We’re at the end of our long, torturous imprisonment here, but there’s more of these facilities out in the galaxy!”

Shocked gasps and murmurs returned, now focused on the atrocity of this facility.

“That’s right! But we know, more than anyone, what’s happening in these facilities and where to look! With their help, we can free thousands of innocents trapped like we were! And if you want to turn away from this, and go back to your families, your lives before this, I won’t stop you. Speh, I’ll encourage you! You’ve all earned your freedom, and no one, not the Farsul, not the Kolshian, nor anyone else in the Federation, take that away from you!”

There were a few tail thumps, some whistles of support, sounds of appreciation, but it was still murmurs and tense silence for the most part. The crowd was noticeably calmer, though, and those with weapons had put them down or away. Still within reach, granted, but I couldn’t exactly fault them for that. Overall, I would say my speech had the desired effect. We were all tired, ready to stop, and now looked forward to the elevator as a positive step to that.

Behind me, the doors hissed as pressure within the chamber equalized with the facility. Turning, I looked at the doors, gulping nervously as the crowd shuffled back a bit. The hissing stopped soon after, and slowly, the doors parted to reveal them.

Within the confines of the elevator they came, the bipedal figures wearing mirror-like masks and military uniforms. The reflective plates glinted as they looked around, and the crowd around me fell silent. I fell in line with their silence as well, though the Predators were lost to my sight. A haze of bodies taller than the average rushed past me in a wave as their doctors began tending to the wounded. Gojids and Zurulians accompanied the humans, and a good number of Venlil began speaking to the crowd, urging them to cooperate.

None but one of their voices reached me, as I approached a brown-furred Venlil with a burn mark on his face.

“... and make sure Carly keeps those thrusters running in case we need emergency exfil to the Xenomedical center!” he spoke into his helmet’s microphone. “These people may have minutes, depending on… on…”

The slow swivel of his gaze turned to me as he nearly dropped his datapad. An artificial eye looked me over as the scarred soldier recognized me. But I knew that face. I knew it even with the changes and ages they must have gone through.

“... Tren?”

A sob escaped my throat as I threw myself at my son. The walls of stoicism and professionalism I had used to keep me going these last few months crumbled into dust as I held my pup for the first time in so long. I wailed, trying to apologize to him, but no words came out. Tears shed from his eyes as well as we wept together.

This war had taken so much from all of us for so long. But not this, for once, something was left behind.

I don’t want to let go, not yet. But I knew we would have to, to get all the other families reunited like we were. I leaned back from the hug, choking to try and form the words as my son did the same.

“I think,” he coughed, “I guess we have a bit to catch up on.”

I pressed my forehead against his, bumping his helmet, giving a loving nuzzle. “We do. We do.”

A nearby figure looked over us, a red cross on their uniform. The reflective visor looked between my son and I, and I felt strange.

“Oh, uh… Tren? This is Kevin. Kevin? This is Tren, my dad.”

I looked at the human and realized that we had much more to catch up on than I thought. 

Namely the strange matching golden rings that he and my son are wearing. “You’re wearing jewlery?” I asked, unable to keep my surprise subdued.

My son whistled. “Oh yeah, we have a LOT to go over.”

**\[Transcription Subject Change: Shalleen, UN Prisoner\]**

*Forwarding Transcription Timeline*

\\/

I was surprised how well the Pred- the *humans* were treating my people and I. They handled us Farsul with a calmer approach, even asking if we needed medical assistance, providing it without care. I was even offered some… ‘Coffee’, they called it. They’re treating us better than our own former coworkers were. To think, *these* creatures were the ones staging a galaxy-spanning war against the Federation? The Kolshians?And *winning*?

I sipped up the warm liquid, easing into my seat as I waited for whatever happened next. When I surrendered myself to the UN, told them of my position, my duties and the role of this facility, they kept me away from the rest. Made sure to keep me… comfortable, in a way? 

It didn’t make sense. Why would the humans care about our comfort? The rebels hadn’t, we had tricked and imprisoned them. And the humans had it so much worse with an actual war going on because of what my government had set up. The Farsul had even been part of the fleet that killed a Billion of their kind. They had more right than anyone to be furious with me and every other Farsul.

Well, *almost* every other Farsul.

Jyavven had been taken in with the rest of those in need of medical assistance, though he was shockingly high in priority despite his injuries not being immediately life-threatening. More people entered the room they kept him in from what I saw, watching from the window in this secluded room. It was strange, I never really spent any time in this topside facility compared to the one below. 

A few humans in particular caught my interest. Black suits, no armor or weapons, but they carried themselves in a far different manner. It was uneasy, watching them deftly weave through so many people as though they weren’t even obstacles. They were focused on their goals and indifferent to anyone else. I would call them predatory, but I had enough experience with my own government to remember seeing the exact same behavior in many of them. They must be agents of the human government. Professionals, at that. 

A few were going in and out of Jyavven’s room in particular, tapping their datapads and zipping between that room and another across from it. I could guess what it was for. Jyavven was the only administrator who had sided with the rebels. He had experience with the genetic modifications we put on the Venlil. If I were a gambler, I’d bet my organic leg he wanted to make a deal with them, reverse his work and help undo the edits to the Venlil. So if anyone was going to get a pass for their freedom, it was likely to be him.

But then, what would become of me? 

I didn’t like that question. After all I had done, I had hoped that I would be able to do something, anything to undue even a fraction of the damage I caused. But was I even going to get the chance? If not, then why was I even in this room? Why were they letting me sit here and watch out the window if they weren’t going to do anything with me?

My thoughts were halted by a human entering the room. Silver faceplate, black suit, and a datapad in hand, the UN logo on their breast. This human was quite short, almost to my eye level, and sported bright brown hair.

“Hello, ma’am,” he greeted. “My name is Camilo, I represent some very interested parties from the UN who would like to discuss the terms of your surrender.”

It was sickeningly sweet, the cadence of his words. Like a mother trying to ease her pup into a visit to the doctor with the promise of treats.

“I… my name is Shalleen, former Director for the THUMR Facility.”

“Hmm, THUMR, you say?” he said, pulling up his datapad and taking a seat. “Mining and Research? Seems a bit-”

“Can we please just… get to the point?” I said, tired of waiting. The anticipation was like a needle slowly trying to pierce through my heart. I wanted it over and done with already. “You know what they’ve said already, what that place really was. I know you’ve enough evidence and testimony to put me away for life. The Facility was never a full-scale mining or research center. It was… it was a prison. We kept them here, isolated, enclosed, and trapped.”

“Mmm hmm…” he hummed, tapping a finger on the desk. “Would you care to explain why?”

I sighed, the Founder’s speech echoing in my head.

“The Kolshian… our Conspiracy believes it has just cause to eradicate anything and everything that could taint the ‘sanctity of life’. We… some Farsul did not see eye-to-eye with their beliefs. We spent generations trying to restrain them, hold back their destruction. This facility and those like it are a last resort measure. The Kolshians *dread* the oceans, lakes, any natural bodies of water. We have no idea why, but they loathe the concept of even recreational activities at a beach! So, we had an advantage. Aquatic bases, undersea military compounds, vaults, archives… prisons. We have bases such as these stationed on most of the Federation homeworlds. In the event of anything that could potentially wipe out an entire species, we’d have backups. A reserve of the best and brightest the species had in our pocket, ready to revitalize a new population. To preserve their kinds, protect them from extinction.”

He was quiet for a moment. Typing at his pad with one hand, head locked directly on to me. It was unnerving. Terrifying, even. My tail tucked between my legs as he stayed silent.

“So,” he said abruptly, “you said there are more facilities like this one? Is there a possibility there’s one on the Cradle?”

“The Gojid homeworld? Yes. Yes, one of my old friends from school was assigned there. As Director, I have access codes to contact their facility on a secured uplink node. One used for emergencies. I can… i-if I can contact them, I could try and convince them to surrender. To open up for you.”

More typing. More silence. A wave of dread crashed upon me as the lights flickered, the pad illuminating the human from below.

“Good,” was all he said, standing up and leaving the room.

I wanted to say something to see what he meant, why he was leaving. The words died on my tongue as the door shut. Alone again, I sat and pondered. Had I… had I sold out my kind for nothing? Did some part of my explanation anger him? 

As I thought, the door opened again, another human that was eerily similar in build, appearance, even the sound of his voice to the last one, walked in.

“Hello, ma’am,” he said, nodding his head. “Name’s Antonio, I’m here to congratulate you.”

I blinked a few times.

“I… I-I’m sorry, what?” I stuttered.

“Seems your application to the SC went through some pretty slick channels, you’ve been approved to join the Sapient Coalition’s Recovery Taskforce,” he said. “As of now, you’ll be assigned to recovery operations to help isolated pockets of civilians in distress and in need of emergency relief. Namely,” he stopped, pulling up his datapad, “first on the agenda, meeting up with Captain Alexander up in orbit. You’ll need to debrief everyone on what these ‘Facilities’ are and how to find and contact them.”

“But… b-but-”

“‘Fraid we don’t have time for questions, ma’am,” he said. “If *your* facility was *this* bad, imagine how bad it likely is for those on the *Cradle*,” he said.

I stood up quickly and he guided me out of the room. As I was led out, I saw Jyavven, laying in bed, looking up at me. He gave a limp wave of his paw, a glimmer of hope in his eyes.

I renewed my steps with a new feeling welling in my chest. A fire lit in me. I had a chance. A chance to make things right. To finally do good. 

My pad chimed as I walked, one forwarded to my personal account. I’d only shared it with a pawful of trusted individuals, and the intrigue of who it could be was too much curiosity to bear. Checking my datapad, I gasped and slowed my walk for only a moment, seeing the familiar name on the screen. 

Trelvin.

My paw rushed to the prompt to open the message, and the world around me faded as I read.

***Shalleen,***

***I hope this letter finds you well. The humans have done a lot to help after what happened. I wanted to let you know that I disclosed everything. I heard that you surrendered peacefully, and I’m thankful that we could stop the bloodshed and violence. They told me what we were doing. They expected me to be disgusted or shocked, but they seemed… upset that I knew all along. The others stopped treating me like a friend, and now no one will listen to me. They don’t believe we had any right, any just cause to justify what we did, but I know. I know that before the humans, before this war, we didn’t have a choice. It wasn’t right. It will never be, what we did. But now… we have a better choice to make. A better goal to set our sights on. I’m going to join this Sapient Coalition in the hopes that we can do something worthwhile. Something closer to what we convinced ourselves we were doing in the Facility. I hope you make the same choice, or at least something similar. Maybe one day we can see each other again. If you ever need to talk, you still have my contact.***

***-Trelvin***

I feel invigorated, after so long. Even if we were told we could have chosen differently, Trelvin was right that we could be certain we could choose now. Choose to actually make things better instead of perpetuating the status quo. And there was so much change. So much to make up for. So much to make better…

I have so much work to do…

Beyond the highway, the treetops were gleaming in the beautiful November paint. Cars were rushing by in mid-day madness, and Misty watched them go in blissful repose as she sipped her coffee. This was, by far, the best job she has ever worked. 

“Hi,” a woman about her age in a buttoned blouse and skirt said, “you must be Misty?” 

Misty lowered her cup and held it nervously in her hands. The woman had shorter length blonde hair. 

“Hi,” Misty said as she accepted the woman’s outstretched hand, “yes, I’m Misty.” 

“Good to meet you, and welcome aboard! I’m Kym Runnels. We work on opposite ends of the room, but I heard we had new face. How are you enjoying it so far?” 

“It’s…great, awesome! I’m loving it here.” 

“That’s good. I hope you decide to stay with us for a while. The woman, Jenny, who used to be in your station worked here for 35 years! Can you imagine that?” 

“Wow, that’s some really big shoes I’ve got to fill. I hope I can live up to it. I hope she’s enjoying retirement.” 

Kym grinned, bashfully. Darting her blue eyes to the floor briefly. 

“Well, she didn’t exactly retire I guess.” 

“Oh?” 

“She…passed away. Quite tragically really.” 

This time it was Misty’s eyes that reacted. 

“Oh, oh my goodness. I’m so sorry. I didn’t know that.” 

“No worries,” Kym said somewhat lowly, “it’s not one of those things management likes to talk about. It happened so suddenly. None of us could’ve seen it coming. She had a stroke, and by the time the paramedics got here, she was gone.” 

There was an awkward moment of silence between them. Finally Misty continued. 

“Did she have family?” 

“Very sadly, yes. Two daughters and a husband. Both of her girls are in college, and her husband is fixing to retire, but still very tragic.” 

“That’s so sad. I hope they’ve found comfort though.” 

“I’m sure they have. Well, here I am putting such a drab on your first day. I’m very happy to have met you, and I hope you have the very best to come.” 

“Thank you, I really appreciate it.” 

Kym shuffled her own coffee into her other hand, extending her palm once more towards Misty. When Misty went to meet it though, Kym’s cup dropped to the floor. Coffee exploded everywhere. 

“Oh no, I am so sorry Misty. You’ll have to forgive me, I’m very clumsy at times. Did you get any in you? I’ll pay for some new clothes if you did.” 

Misty shook her hand. “No, I’m fine, but thank you. Are you okay? I hope none got on yourself.” 

“No, I’m fine. I’ll go and grab some paper-“ 

The phone at Kym’s station started to blare. Kym glanced at it, then back at the spilled coffee. 

“Oh…shit. Sorry, I mean dang it.” 

“You can just point me in the direction of the paper towels. I’ll go and get some.” Misty said gently. 

“No, I can’t ask that of you. It’s not your mess.” 

“Accidents happen. It’s totally fine Kym, I promise. I’m on my 20 minute break, so I don’t mind at all.” 

Kym’s phone rang for the third time. 

“Thank you, Misty. It’s your first day and I already owe you one! Thank you so much.” 

Kym dashed towards her station and answered the phone before the fourth tone rang. Misty glanced around for a roll of paper towels. She wasn’t sure where they could be, but the break room at the back of the office was probably a good guess. 

There was only one other person in the break room, slurping down a freshly cooked cup of noodles. He looked up at Misty when she walked in. 

“Hi, I’m new here. Don’t mean to interrupt, but do you happen to know where the paper towels are?” 

“Hey, I’m Darren. I think the dispenser just ran out down here. The supply closet’s upstairs though. The janitorial guy just took the elevator up there. You know where that’s at?” 

“The elevator? Yeah, for sure. What floor is it on?” 

“Fourth floor. Right above us. The janitor guy should still be up there. It’s where all the old computers and stuff are stored at. Do you need me to help you find it?” 

Misty shook her head somewhat anxiously. Too stubborn to ask for help. 

“I’m good, thank you though. Nice to meet you Darren. I’m Misty, by the way.” 

“Good to meet you. If you need help, just come and ask me. I’m on Lunch right now.” 

“I’m sure I’ll be fine. Thanks again though, and enjoy your soup.” 

The doors of the elevator opened up to the fourth floor of the building. It was hard thinking that there were two more even above it. When the dusty aroma of the storage level hit her, she knew she was in the right place. Stepping out, she saw all the computers sitting haphazardly about. 

Dusty flat screen monitors, towers, faded mice, and even the old square ones from when she was a kid. For a moment, Misty had a rush of nostalgia. 

“Looking for something?” A woman called out. 

Misty was somewhat startled. An older woman in a purple shirt stood in the small aisle between the old computers. 

“Hi, um, I’m new here and I just needed to come and get a roll of paper towels. One of the women downstairs spilled her coffee.” 

The lady walked forward, the glow of the humming halogen lights crackling above her dark hair. Her face was oval shaped, and a pair of glasses hung loosely to the crown of her nose. 

“Such a shame. It’s never good to waste coffee. I can come down and clean it for her. Would you like for me too?” 

Misty was slightly confused. 

“No, thank you. I think I can handle it. Just need a roll of paper towels. I was told the janitor was up here.” 

The woman smiled. “I’m the janitor, dear.  I’ll take care of that for you. But I just need you to ask me though.” 

Misty stood in stillness. “It’s…it’s okay. I can handle it. I don’t want to disturb you.” 

“Nonsense, it’s not your job. You can ask me to come, dear. I don’t mind at all.” 

“No, I’m-“ 

“Ask me!” The woman suddenly demanded. 

Trembling, Misty replied. 

“Okay, yes mam! Can you come and clean the floor please? There, I asked you. Can I get a roll of paper towels?” 

The woman’s smile returned. Her green eyes glistened. 

“I have some right here.” She reached behind a computer monitor and brought out a roll of paper towels. “I’ll follow you down there.” 

Misty and the woman stepped into the elevator in silence. Misty wasn’t sure how to act or what to say. 

“It’s beautiful outside isn’t it, dear?” 

Misty falsely grinned. 

“Yes mam, it is. I’ve never worked in a multi-storied building before. It’s nice being able to see the trees across the road.” 

The doors closed slowly. 

“Oh yes, indeed. Did you know that when they were building this place, the construction workers uncovered an old Indian village?” 

“Wow, no mam, I wasn’t aware of that.” 

“It was a remarkable discovery! A whole village, hidden beneath the forest soil. They were supposed to have an archaeological team from the state study and research it, but the greed of progress couldn’t be stalled.” 

The 3rd floor ding tolled. 

“What became of it?” Misty asked. 

The woman turned her head and slowly looked at her. 

“Nothing. They just built this whole building right on-top of it all. Caring nothing about the ancient beliefs and traditions of vanished cultures.” 

The doors opened, and Kym stood in front of them. Her blue eyes widened in shock. 

“Jenny!” Kym cried out in horror. 

In a flash, the woman’s skin became oozy ligaments. Her hands transformed into sharpened animal hooves, and a snout of a white bone animal skull burst from her face. It launched itself towards Kym, jagged teeth cinching down into her neck and flinging her limp body through a nearby row of computers. 

Misty watched, mortified as the creature attacked others nearby. Screams, cries of terror, and terrified voices rocked the room. Bodies were hurtled everywhere, crashing through cubicles and sending electric sparks onto the walls and ceiling. 

With a freshly severed arm hanging from its bloodied jaws, the empty eyes of the beast looked at Misty. In the same elderly voice, it said. 

“Flames always burn upward, dear. I’d get out of this place before it all comes crashing down.” 

Misty rushed towards the stairs. Fleeing as fast as her young legs could carry her. When she burst through the front door, she raced to the edge of the parking lot. Stopping to catch her breath, Misty lifted her head and stared at the trunks of the swaying autumn colored trees across from her.

I have been living on my own for 8 years and for most of this time I felt lonely. Initially I thought if I get a relationship this problem will be solved but I ended up choosing out of desperation, the relationship fall apart after few months and that made me feel worse than before. 

After a year or so I had another small relationship from a girl I met on tinder and it ended up being similar, so again worse than before. 

Then I decided to work on myself and put focus on meaningful work which helped me a lot but is not giving all I need, I feel something is still missing. I do not understand what it is. 

I also have to say that lost contact with some of my friends in the last period. Because they tend to do boring stuff, like meeting at coffee place and talk about meaningless stuff or repeat some of funny stories happened in the past over and over, they also lack ambition so I decided to distance myself. 

I try to bury myself with work and have to big goals for my career, I also try to go to the gym, all these helps but I still feel my life does have something missing, like I wish I could find something to be excited about the day. 

Recently I kept asking myself is this feeling due to the lack of connection?

I understand that whipped cream will melt on hot coffee, but the store brand melted much more quickly than Land O' Lakes.

I understand that some people may not be as particular about their whipping cream, but for those who care about quality and taste, the store brand is not a suitable substitute for Land O' Lakes.

I sincerely hope that Costco will continue to offer Land O'Lakes products alongside their own brand of whipping cream. In a competitive market, sales figures will ultimately determine which product is preferred by consumers.",0,1730408612.0,Costco,6,0.21,False

1ggoyo7,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1ggoyo7/trip_report_vietnam_and_laos_7_weeks_septoct/,"Trip Report! Vietnam and Laos (7 Weeks, Sept-Oct)","Hello! ສະບາຍດີ! Xin chào! I wanted to share my experience from my first solo trip. I spent 7 weeks in Vietnam and Laos.

*Budget*

**I budgeted $2500 USD and ended up spending $2700 USD.** I could have probably saved about $200-$300 if I had thought ahead a little bit more (booked a few flights; would still do again due to the length of the trip) and if I didn't make a few mistakes (I got got a few times, oh well)

My biggest categories for spending were Activities (which I include costs for things like museums, attractions, day trips, overnight trekking trips, etc.), Flights (which can certainly be avoided; I just gave up on buses), Shopping, and Food/Meals.

My daily budget was $50 USD and in the end I averaged $54 USD per day. I used the app TravelSpend which was SO helpful. I highly recommend.

*Trip Length*

7 weeks (Sept 11-Oct 30)

\~4 weeks in Vietnam, \~3 Weeks in Laos

*Destinations*

In Vietnam my route was: Ho Chi Minh City - Hoi An - Hue - Phong Nha - Ninh Binh - Hanoi - Cat Ba - Ha Giang Loop - Hanoi

In Laos my route was: Luang Prabang - Nong Khiaw - Luang Prabang - Vang Vieng - Vientiane

*Accommodation*

I used Hostel World the whole trip to book which was super easy. Granted I think I was there before the high season but I would book a bed only one or two days before arriving. Ceapest beds for dorm rooms were usually between $4 and $9 USD.

Vietnam Hostels (and Rating): **HCMC**: Saigon Rooftops Hostel (10/10); **Hoi An**: Mad Monkey (7/10), iHome Hoi An (9/10); **Hue**: New World Hotel (9.5/10); **Phong Nha**: Central Backpackers Hostel (10/10); **Ninh Binh**: The Banana Tree Hostel (9.5/10); **Hanoi**: The One Hostel (8/10), Hanoi Oldtown Nomad Hostel (6/10), Hanoi Central Backpackers (9/10); **Cat Ba**: The One Hostel (8/10); **Ha Giang Loop**: Mama's Homestay (9/10)

Laos Hostels (and Rating): **Luang Prabang**: Sunrise Riverside Pool Hostel (11/10); **Nong Khiaw**: DK-Camping and ATV Adventure (9/10) (I booked my homestay through Sabou, who manages this tour company and stayed in one of his bungalows); **Vang Vieng**: Chill House (8/10), Mad Monkey (8/10); **Vientiane**: Funky Monkey Hostel (2/10, avoid this place)

*Top Activities*

Ha Giang Loop (Ha Giang, Vietnam): Definitely a peak moment on this trip. I did 4 days, 3 nights with Mama's Homestay (around $200 USD) and had the time of my life. I had an easyrider (local driver) and saw some of the most breathtaking views I had ever seen before. It was like you turn a corner and see the most beautiful thing ever think that nothing can top it, then you turn the next corner and its even better. The food was amazing and the homestays throughout the trip were nice. The drivers are absolutely rockstars. They are so kind and welcoming and just totally enhance the trip. I also had a great group that I was placed with. The happy water stays flowing as well.

Paramotoring (Vang Vieng, Laos): Sunrise paramotoring ($100 USD) was not something I thought I would do on my trip but it was definitely a highlight. Soaring above Vang Vieng and the blanket of clouds so that the mountain tops just barely are peaking above. Insane views and such a cool experience.

Trekking in Nong Khiaw, Laos: I did a one day tour ($30) and a 2 day overnight tour ($40) here. Nong Khiaw is definitely an up and coming spot for eco-tourism. It feels like an authentic experience and you really get a good look at the rural parts of Laos. The one day tour was great and I got to see some rice fields, a water fall, a cave, a lookout point, and take a boat ride. The 2 day overnight was the highlight though. You hike up a mountain and arrive at the top as the sun is setting and get breathtaking views. Then you learn to make some Laotian food, sleep under the stars, and wake up to a beautiful sunrise. Highly recommend getting up to Nong Khiaw; about a 4 hour bus ride from Luang Prabang. I stayed at a homestay with the nicest family and learned lots about Laotian food and culture.

Day cruise (Cat Ba/Ha Long Bay, Vietnam): A day cruise ($25) that leaves from Cat Ba and shows you the beauty of Ha Long Bay. The insane rock formations and blue ass water make for stunning views everywhere. Swimming, kayaking, feeding monkeys, and soaking up the sun.

Hai Van Pass, Vietnam: I spent $15 to rent a scooter in Hoi An to drive to Hue via the Hai Van Pass. It was my first time ever driving a scooter and it was so fun! As you drive up and over the mountain you can make stops at these awesome coffee shops that overlook the pass and make for stunning views. After the mountain you can drive through some cool fishing villages and get a look at what Vietnam looks like outside of the tourist areas like Hoi An or Da Nang. Some parts of the highway were definitely not as fun when driving alongside semi-trucks, but this was still super worth it. Even if you don't drive yourself it is still a great ride (you can book an easyrider). The company I rented the scooter from gave me recommendations for places to stop and shuttled my big bag to Hue. I highly recommend renting a scooter at some point in your time in Vietnam!

*What Went Right*

* I met so many amazing people staying in hostels and going on tours. Even though this was a solo trip, I never really was alone. I even traveled with some people for 2-3 weeks! I made some life long friends :)
* I took it slow. I initially planned to only spend 2 weeks in Vietnam (which now sounds like crazy talk). I could have absolutely spent the whole 7 weeks there. I really learned to embrace the solo traveler/backpacker mindset of taking things slow, not planning too far in advance, and going with the flow. I ended up spending nearly 11 days in Luang Prabang. It can be so easy to get stuck somewhere and I would totally say to allow yourself to get stuck if you really connect with a place or people!
* I am pretty happy with my spending. Definitely could have cut some costs but to be honest I thought I was going to blow my budget by a lot more than $200 so I'll take it!
* Moved hostels if I felt like I needed a change or didn't like something at the current one. Only book for 1 or 2 nights at a time and extend if you want to (not sure if this works in the high season)

*What Went Wrong*

* Definitely got taken advantage of a few times. Always ask prices before you start anything (this includes taking taxis/tuk tuks/scooters, going on an impromptu tour, etc.) and don't be afraid to be stern or walk away.
* Weather was a barrier a few times. Didn't do much research beforehand on when I was arriving, which was near the end of the rainy season. Was confronted with Supertyphoon Yagi and a couple other storms.
* Wish I didn't fly as much. I flew from HCMC to Hoi An to make it in time for a full moon/harvest festival which I don't regret however I did skip Dalat which I want to go back to. Flew from Hanoi to Luang Prabang to avoid a 25 hour bus ride (if you have taken that ride I salute you, my body could not handle that). And flew from Vientiane to HCMC since I booked roundtrip to/from HCMC. Those flights are cheap-ish but they add up. I would try to avoid them.

*Recommendations*

My favorite stops were Hoi An, Phong Nha, Ha Giang, Luang Prabang, and Nong Khiaw. Highly recommend you really spend some time in Laos; many people told me you can do Laos in less than 2 weeks, which you can, but I think it is so worth spending some more time there (I didn't even scrape the south!).

I learned a lot through solo travel. It was such a positive experience overall but there are definitely difficult moments where you feel alone, homesick, tired, or just not 100% and that is okay. For me, the first week was a huge adjustment and I considered going home early so many times; try and stick it out. It is worth it. But also make sure to take care of yourself first and foremost.

Recommendations are just that! Everybody has different perspectives, mindsets, desires, goals, opinions...try to not get absorbed into other people's opinions on things and give everything a try! Ultimately, you'll have an experience that will be unique to you.

*Final Verdict:*

I feel like I've said a lot and there is so much more to say! I had such an amazing time in Vietnam and Laos and am counting down the days until I get to go back. The people in both those countries are so kind and welcoming. Their countries are full of rich culture and history, delicious food, and amazing experiences. Solo travel was such a life changing experience and I think everyone should try it at least once if they can! If you're headed to either country I am happy to share more recs!

I like to eat in the evenings, so I fast for about 20 hours. Obviously, I don't stick too much to it but it is always the goal. My hubs and I do a 5 mile walk on weekends and our reward is always a hot dog (tofu dog for me), so I don't really fast them. Also, I take those days to have some delicious creamer in my morning coffee. I make sure I do 30 min. cardio almost every day, whether it was a routine on the elliptical or a walk on the treadmill.

I drink a protein shakes every day to break my fast, and if I feel like I won't get enough calories in at dinner, I break my fast early to get some snacks in... It's hard for me to eat that much in one sitting.

She’s way out of my league and pretty popular. We talk here and there, and yes, I’ve done some Instagram stalking. She’s got tons of photos, but they’re all with her girl squad or sorority sisters from the most popular sorority in college, she’s a party animal, still no sign of a boyfriend or close male friends. Most of the time, I see her hanging out with other female colleagues.

I’ve tried dropping casual questions like, “What do you do on weekends?” or “Any plans with friends/family?” but there’s never any hint of a boyfriend. I feel like the only way to figure out her relationship status would be to ask directly, which I’m hesitant to do because I don’t want to come across as a creep in a work setting.

I asked her out once, but I kept it casual, like a coffee chat rather than a date. She politely turned me down, saying she already had a girls’ day planned for that day, but suggested we could plan it for another time. But it was vague and not specific. And, it’s legit that she had a girls’ day that day.

1ggottq,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ggottq/i_27m_broke_up_with_my_girlfriend_25f_for_a/,I (27M) broke up with my girlfriend (25F) for a selfish reason. Can I do something to make things better for her?,"I apologize for the long post, but this is complicated. 

My girlfriend (now ex) and I met online during covid. We both had joined a random Discord server where people used to play games at night. Everyone was at home (lockdown), and it was the only way to get social. We connected there and started talking to each other for countless hours. 

A little history about me (for context):
I’m a shy person in real life, and I never really had the chance to talk to girls. Growing up, I went to school with my sibling, who was in my class, and all the girls in my class were friends with her. I was always too conscious to flirt or open up with any of them because I thought my sister would find out and tease me forever. Even in college, I stayed focused on my goals and never opened up socially. I was over-ambitious and wanted to do something big in life (like be the next Elon Musk, lol). So, I kept bunking college and used to keep working on my laptop alone.

Fast forward to the COVID lockdown, I started having long and deep conversations with this girl. She looked pretty, and way out of my league. I was having the time of my life. All things were going well in life, I started earning good on my own, and then her entrance, everything seemed like a fairy tale. I was finally connecting with someone. 

Then, my dad got sick and I needed someone badly. I completely forgot everything, my career, my goal, my purpose.. all I wanted was my dad to recover quickly. So, I'd talk to her for hours, and she helped calm me down during that tough time. I ended up falling for her before we had even met in person.

About six months into talking, we finally met. I traveled to her city after her college reopened, and we had our first date. Things were great, and we started meeting regularly. I used to travel to meet her twice a month. We committed to each other and everything felt like a dream. However, there was one issue: physical intimacy. Despite making out and getting close, we never had sex because she was afraid of penetration. I tried talking to her about it, but she said she needed time. I understood at first, but as more than a year passed without progress, I started getting frustrated. I had fantasies and desires I wanted to explore, but she wasn’t willing to initiate anything or even help me get off. She'd hardly touch my d***. 

On top of that, she wasn’t doing well emotionally. She felt out of place because her college friends were all super rich, and she wanted to do something meaningful, like I did. I encouraged her to start experimenting with freelance work, as she was earning some decent (but unstable) money. 

We had been together for 2.5 years without much change in our physical relationship, which bothered me. I started feeling left out when my friends would share stories about their sex lives, and being 25 and still a virgin started to weigh on me. I know it’s not right, but it got to me.

So, I had a friend in my city, whom I used to meet sometimes. I would share my frustrations with her because I needed to vent. She would tease me about it, but all in a friendly way. Like she would tell her office stories, or about a girl who was caught making out, etc. etc. I started enjoying these talks and would tell my gf whenever I was talking to her or meeting her, because I wanted to be open and honest.

One day, my girlfriend opened my WhatsApp and read some of our conversations. We were talking about some random girl and I had just commented things like ""Oh, that's wild"" and she thought I was cheating on her. I tried explaining, but she labeled me a cheater and broke up. I spent 6-7 days trying to reason with her, but she was too angry to listen. And I was frustrated. I was angry since I never even went out with anyone without telling her (being in a long distance) in those 2.5 years and she broke up so easily calling me a cheater. Out of frustration, I installed Bumble. I wasn’t even sure if I wanted to meet anyone, but then one girl convinced me to go out because she had canceled her plans for me. I decided to meet her for coffee for an hour or so.

While I was on this date, my ex called (after almost a week). I ignored her twice, but when she messaged me that it was urgent, I called her back. She heard a girl in the background and directly asked me who I was with. I told her the truth: I was on a date because she had accused me of cheating and broken up with me.
She started crying uncontrollably. I quickly ended the date, apologized to the girl, and dropped her off. That evening, my ex and I talked for 5-6 hours. I explained my sexual frustration, apologized, and promised I wouldn’t do it again. 

A few months later, she finished her studies and started looking for a job. She wasn’t having any luck and began feeling depressed. All her friends from college went back to their families' businesses, while she felt stuck and isolated. She started feeling worthless and I decided to help her. I told her that she could try to set up a small business and I would help her with all the investment. She took the opportunity but didn't have a co-founder. Meanwhile, my running business was also going down and I decided to take a leap of faith. I wanted to help her get out of that phase, no friends in the city, no one to talk to, and a very bad lifestyle. So, I joined as a cofounder (remote). I thought if the business succeeds, we'd both have a similar lifestyle and despite having a long-distance relationship, we'd both get an equal amount of available time to talk to each other. 

We tried to run the business for 1 year, but it failed. I went into debt and she got into the same phase again. No job, no friends, no one to talk to. She only had me to rely on emotionally. My lifestyle has always been opposite to hers. I live with my parents and have lots of friends here. So, my day is always full of activities while she struggles in a different city. She wakes up and is clueless about her day. She wants someone to talk to at the end of the day, and to hang out sometimes. But after getting into debt, I wanted to focus more on my career. I also find it harder to travel to a different city and stay in a hotel to meet her. I am probably at the worst career phase of my life too. I am 27 now and she's 25. 

I tried very hard to give her time every day, but I started getting more frustrated. I used to get anxious thinking about my debt situation. And I can't share with her either, because it would give her anxiety as well, since she's also struggling with money. Our fights became more frequent, and it was hard for me to be there for her emotionally while trying to fix my own life. She needed someone who could spend long hours with her, but I just couldn’t manage that. Eventually, I suggested we break up. I told her that we both needed space to grow, that I couldn’t give her the time she deserved, and that staying together might hold us both back. She’s heartbroken, and so am I, but I don’t see any other way to fix things.

She's very sad now. I don't know how's she managing, and she thinks all kinds of stuff now. She thinks I’m breaking up with her because we never had sex, and it breaks my heart that she believes that. She’s been a loyal and supportive girlfriend, and it feels like giving up a part of myself to end things. My heart broke down when she called me and said: ""Please don't leave me"". I cried after the call. 

I don't know how to calm her down and help her at the same time, being selfishly focused on my career. I know I have a busy lifestyle and it gives me less time to think about this, I will still manage. But she's alone and it would be eating her. I try to somehow get in touch with her every 2 days just to make sure she's okay. I know she's sad and angry at me, but i have no idea how to deal with it. Neither does she. I am all the time worried about her. I don't know how to calm her down and make her understand things. 

TLDR: Met my ex during COVID, and dated for 4 years (long distance). Career struggles and emotional dependency strained our relationship. I suggested breaking up for both of our growth, but she’s devastated, and I’m torn about how to help her while focusing on my career.",4,1730408085.0,relationship_advice,14,1.0,False

When I was debating switching to Prozac, I came to Reddit for others experiences, so I am here to share my experience now that it’s been a little over 4 weeks.

I was on Celexa 30mg, went down to 20mg during my pregnancy which ended in a miscarriage (not due to meds, just background info) and my sister told me she had a great experience on Prozac. I started on 10 for a week and 10 Celexa then switch after 7 days to 20 mg of Prozac.

The negatives: a few headaches here and there, moderate constipation (went 7 days without a bowel movement, but able to use Miralax), two really bad bouts of diarrhea. But I am back to regular BM’s after the 4 weeks. A little irritable.

Weird symptoms: I don’t enjoy coffee as much anymore. The amount of caffeine I can handle has been reduced by a lot.

Positives: brain fog is gone, Celexa/Citalopram always felt like I was not clear. My sex life has improved with my husband! 
I have some concentration issues still but getting g tested for ADD here soon.

Let me tell you a tale. I work hard... and by ""hard,"" I mean I earn 50k a year. I went to a good university, scored some pretty solid grades, and even helped a friend with his base code that accidentally turned into a successful company (yes, I’ll accept partial blame). 

Three years ago, I took the first job I was offered because, let’s be honest, I was mildly terrified about the future of this whole field. Fast forward to today: I’m the lone QA tester on a sea of projects. And I’m... bored. Bored out of my mind.

I liked to study during my freetime, this habit faded away since I had no use of my knowledge in my current job. But occasionaly I help friends that are developers or testers with their tickets when I'm bored.

I've automated almost everything there is to automate. All my test cases are linked to every requirement, I’ve got CI/CD pipelines running smoother than my coffee machine, and I generate so many reports they’re practically growing their own inboxes. And yet—no one checks my work because no one knows how any of my tools actually work. 

I’ve automated with every framework out there for fun Pytest, Playwright, Cypress. Heck, I’ve even “automated” my wife to find bugs when I’m bored. But, at this point, even my fun ideas are running dry.

On top of that they don't do releases that often so I have built a wall with hidden entrances that only I know of or incase people really need to talk to me about QA.

My coworkers are dinosaurs who spend their days in endless meetings about the tiniest, most irrelevant things. Meanwhile, the systems are all stable, and here I am, the QA ghost in the corner, bored but comfortable.

Could I ask for more work? Sure, and sometimes I do. But I’m also totally comfortable here, doing basically nothing. Could I switch jobs for more cash? Definitely. But the job market scares me, and honestly, I’ve gotten really good at this “doing nothing” routine.

Here’s my daily remote grind: 
8:30 – Wake up
9:30 – Stand-up meeting
10:00 – Breakfast (need those priorities)
11:00 – Check email
12:00 – Gym (or as I call it, “bench testing”)
1:30 – Actually do my job
4:00 – Log off

I do nothing
I feel bored
But I am comfortable.

1ggoouh,https://www.reddit.com/r/disabled/comments/1ggoouh/how_do_i_approach_my_care_workerbest_friend_about/,How do I approach my care worker/best friend about not meeting job expectations ,"So I am wheelchair bound, I live “independently” I guess. Through a waiver I get a personal care worker, and for almost 3 years, my best friend has been doing the job. There have been many obstacles to this situation, and I find myself back at a crossroads of where the job expectations are not being met, and I feel like I’m being taken advantage of. I am a terrible people pleaser, and have horrible boundary setting skills. I don’t like saying the hard things, even when it’s the truth and they need to hear it. 

So this past week my partner has been off work, and my care worker has only shown up once, which was this past Monday. It is a part time job, of 25 hours per week. Normally the help I need is getting up for work (work from home), toileting assistance, and help getting food, coffee, dressed if I need it, etc. My worker continues to ask me what I need done, but then takes no initiative to do the job. I also found out that she clocks in at her house, before she leaves, not when she arrives to my house. And there have been continuous instances of her logging 6-11 hour days, when she is not here, not actively working. 

I just checked today (10/31) and saw she clocked in, when all she did was stop by to pick up something that I borrowed, no work was done at all!
 I think she also clocked in on Tuesday, when she didn’t show up or speak to me at all!

And there has been an ongoing situation of the hours worked on paper exceeding the hours actually worked in person. There was over 15 extra hours on her last time sheet, that were not worked, nor an agreement made for those additional hours. 

I just feel so used, and like I’m constantly being taken advantage of by someone who should care. They expect all the responsibility to fall on my partner, and then act odd towards my partner when we are all around each other. 

How do I politely approach this, and make her see how much she is using me and taking advantage of my kindness?",2,1730407715.0,disabled,9,1.0,False

1ggonqy,https://www.reddit.com/r/debian/comments/1ggonqy/dell_usbc_dock_suddenly_stopped_working_with/,"Dell USB-C dock suddenly stopped working with Debian 12, I've tried everything.","I'm on a Dell Precision 5540 with a Dell WD19TB dock, running Debian 12. This computer previously had Windows 10 but I removed it in September with Debian. It worked perfectly until yesterday, when I had to disconnect the laptop from its dock to attend a Zoom meeting. After I re-connected the laptop to the dock, it no longer identified the monitors. The monitors are connected via DisplayPort and HDMI. Since then I've tried everything. I'd disabled Secure Boot in the BIOS, installed nvidia-driver, ensured that ""No Security"" is set for Thunderbolt in the BIOS, replaced Debian with Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (the version stated as supported by Dell for the dock), and finally tried to use EnvyControl to disable the integrated GPU. This bricked my install of Debian so I've reinstalled it and the monitors are still not detected. I've installed the DisplayLink drivers from Synaptic, and unplugged / re plugged all replaced all cables countless times. I ran the Dell Update Utility for the WD19TB dock, but it crashed with an error about no permissions, even though I ran it as super user.

My laptop has one HDMI port, and any monitor connected from there works, but the USB C dock does not work.

I've tried it with many other docks, including the TB16, which used to work fine with my laptop but now has the same issue. But on the Dell WD15 and WD19 (non TB) dock, I was able to get xrandr to recognize the displays, and even display an output on the monitors momentarily, before they went back to ""No SIgnal."" Both the WD15 and WD19 recognize the monitors in xrandr, but the monitors do not receive any signal.

I have a Lenovo Chromebook with Debian 12 installed, and it is able to produce a signal to my monitors with the Dell WD19TB Dock, but for some reason my main laptop can't. I'm not sure what to do now. I really don't want to have to go back to Windows 10 but I can't see any other option now. Is there anything else I can do to fix this issue? What confuses me most is that it was working just yesterday morning and now nothing works. Thanks so much.

1ggonoz,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1ggonoz/microplastic_controversy/,Microplastic Controversy,"Questions about plastics in contact with hot water pop up on this sub fairly frequently. Comments are almost always very polarized. Some people are positive it's a major issue, others are positive it's not even worth considering. 

I fall somewhere in the middle; I use plastic drippers, I love how cheap and durable they are, but I also have some level of concern that they are yet another source of microplastics entering my body. 

Those of you who are confident there is no risk associated with hot water in contact with plastics, how did you form this opinion? I want to be on team plastic, but the more I read, the more I want to limit my plastic exposure, particularly plastics in contact with hot water. 

While these studies aren't directly related to coffee drippers, and they are not conclusive, with a quick search on Pub Med you can find loads of studies on the topic plastic and hot water. Many highlight the need for concern and further investigation:

This only seems to happen after I make espresso. Today the BOLD button turned on, which was a first, and I had to disconnect the machine. Am I the only one that this has happened to?

I use 1zpresso x-pro grinder and mainly brew Tim Wendelboe coffees (now I'm having October subscription beans).

I first dialed in at room temp and put them into the freezer.

My observations have been:
1. Requires much coarser grind setting: if I dialed in with a single pour recipe at 1:5:0 grind setting, I need to go as coarse as 2:3:0~2:4:0 with the same recipe to get similar cups.
2. Much more sensitive to grind size change: even a few clicks change make a huge difference that makes me quite frustrated.

1ggok6d,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1ggok6d/need_suggestions_for_next_vacation/,Need Suggestions for Next Vacation,"Looking for suggestions on our next family vacation in the U.S. Here are the particulars:

* Myself and husband (both 49), our 14 year old son and probably a friend of his
* Driving only from Southern Missouri area -our limit is probably 16 hour distance. Last year we drove to Amelia Island Florida and year before that Ouray, Colorado.
* Son is insisting on a cabin on a lake where he and friend can go fishing. If this is the case, I need it to be on the lake to where I can sit on a porch and sip coffee.
* My husband wants stuff to do. Now, if I asked him what kind of stuff he would say, ""I don't know...stuff""
   * We're pretty low key and don't like to be on the go all the time.
   * When we went to Amelia Island, we would have beach days, a day in town, a day in St. Augustine, and we did an airboat tour.
   * When we were in Ouray, we went offroading on trails in our Xterra, sightseeing in towns, and went to 4 corners (it was too hot to do much else)
   * My husband and son love motorsports -so if there's anything with a racetrack nearby would be a plus.
* I can't really do much physical as I have issues with my feet (major surgeries in both). We're not really theme park kind of people. I like history and museums.
* Ultimately, I want to relax and decompress.

The Great Lakes were bantered about a bit as well as Minnesota.

We don't need anything fancy inside a cabin or house -tend to do VRBOs. We don't really watch tv when we're on vacation but we do prefer cabins so we don't have to eat out all of the time.

1. **Cookie-Cutter Vibes**: Many listings are straight-to-Airbnb flats, lacking soul and styled like tacky escape rooms with AliExpress decor.
2. **Fake Reviews**: Some places have dozens of glowing 5-star reviews but feel subpar, leaving you wondering if the stars are... bought?
3. **Overhyped Listings**: Every property sounds like ""the best place ever,"" but descriptions gloss over the downsides, and photos are often flattering at best.
4. **Impersonal Management**: Many rentals are run by companies managing multiple properties, making it feel less “local” and more “corporate.”
5. **Hidden Hotels**: Some ""apartments"" are really hotel rooms in disguise, with nothing more than a coffee machine to sell the “apartment” idea.

Airbnb’s promise of an authentic, “live-like-a-local” experience feels like it’s fading. I recently rented a “4.8-star” spot with no windows – something the photos hid too well.

Turns out, a few tiny adjustments made a big difference. Here’s what actually helped:

1. Delay Morning Caffeine: I used to chug coffee first thing, but I started waiting 60-90 minutes after waking. I feel less “wired” and more balanced by afternoon.
2. Brain Dump Before Bed: Used to lie awake thinking about unfinished stuff. Now I just write down anything still on my mind. I don't just sit and think about all those little things anymore.
3. Morning Sunlight: A quick 5-minute step outside in the morning has helped my sleep-wake cycle. Feels like my body's clock is finally working with me instead of against me.

1ggod95,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ggod95/something_left_a_charred_squirrel_in_my_basement/,Something Left a Charred Squirrel In My Basement,"I’ve never been able to smell. Not once, my entire life. I’d been to multiple doctors when I was young about it. Some said it was something with my brain, but CT Scans & MRIs always came back without anything proving such. Some of them said it was something in my nose, a slightly misshapen bone, or something of that nature. But as usual, nothing came out of it. At some point, it just got too expensive for my parents, who already were quite busy sitting on the couch most of the day, to go to the doctors anymore over something that really wouldn’t affect me all too much. And, in all fairness, it really hasn’t. Never had to smell no fart nor a recently deceased skunk. I can still taste funnily enough, despite other people I know constantly saying things such as 

“You can’t taste because your nose receptors are connected to your taste ones!”

But I know I can taste it because I like chocolate milk more than normal milk. Though don’t be mistaken, it’s not all great. I will never smell the scent of a rose, nor smell the freshly baked pie, levitating towards it slowly, nor for me to ever smell the scent of a candle bought for me as a gift by some distant family member that doesn’t know about my condition. Sorry Aunt Rebecca, I really would love the gift if it was anything more than a fire hazard for me. So until recently, I never expected to experience any smell in my life. Yet, something changed.



A few years back I managed to save up enough money to fully move out on my own, with my black labrador, Jessie. It was a small house, only 1 story if you excluded the basement. The entrance door would always bang into the wall next to it when I opened it, but it was no big deal since no one really ever noticed the dent in the wall next to the door. The door opened to the kitchen, which was small. Had a countertop that would barely fit a watermelon, a stove that doubled as an oven, a fridge, and some pantries. I also bought a table that was large enough to house at least 6 guests for when they visited, but I rarely had anyone over except for my older brother, Brandon.



 He would occasionally visit when he or I needed help, or to just spend some time with his bro. He was a taller person, had glasses, a thin beard, and brown messy hair. Next to the kitchen was a long hallway that led to the bathroom, the guest room, and at the very end of the hall, my bedroom. My bed was small, dark purple sheets I got on sale at some thrift store a couple years back. On the other side of the kitchen was yet another hallway, but instead of being straight down like the first, it went sideways either way. One way was to the basement, which was a staircase that had a sudden 45 degree turn half-way through. The basement itself was a long room, I’d say it was about half the size of the house even. Near the end of the stairs was a door that led to a storage room, which was the other half of the house. The light switch was at the bottom of the stairs, so I could only see what was down there when I got to the bottom.



 I renovated it to be a nice living room like space, having a tv, a long leather couch that could recline individual segments, and a coffee table. Though this wasn’t really needed, since the other way the hall went was to the upstairs living room, which had a larger tv, more space, and 4 individual chairs. This room also had a glass back door, with shades and locks of course. It was a nice and cozy house, and Jessie loved it. He was a good boy, when I brought him out back so he could relieve himself he would never try to jump over the fences, or kill the baby bunnies in there like my dad’s dog, Elmer. Elmer was a fat pug might I add, so those bunnies were part of natural selection. But of course Jessie had his problems too, like all dogs. 



When he started barking at something, he would not stop until he had exhausted himself out, and when he had something in his mouth, he would growl at those who tried to take it from him, never would bite though. Other than that, he loved new people, would always jump up on them and try to lick their ears, learned behavior from Elmer. Life was routine. I worked as a mortician, since the smell of bodies never affected me other than making me smell like one according to others. It paid well, good enough to support my lifestyle. The sight of dead bodies, especially in the more gruesome cases, was sickening at first. Made me get plenty of nightmares, and lost me plenty of sleep. But eventually, I got used to seeing dead people nearly every day, and it was no longer a problem for me.



Recently, however, some strange things have happened. It was barely anything at first, small things that I thought were a byproduct of me working at a morgue. House centipedes started appearing in my basement. This was never uncommon in my house, but I mean I would find dozens of them hidden under a shirt I had left on the ground. They would skitter away into the storage room before I had time to squish any of the things. I knew they were good for some situations, since they apparently ate cockroaches and such, but this was too many for my liking. So, after finding almost 100 hiding under my chair, I decided to pack enough clothes for a week, brought dog food and some chew toys, and went to a hotel for a week whilst an exterminator company named ULTRA-EXTERMINATORS dealt with the issue.

“How long will it be?” I asked the receptionist on the phone.

“Well while I cannot say exactly how long it will take, most cases like this take around 4-5 days.” the woman responded, with an overly-cheerful tone that made me somewhat spiteful of her.



The hotel Jessie and I stayed at was quite decent, actually, but was way over-priced in my opinion. It was a small room, the red blankets on the bed strongly tucked in, to the point where I couldn’t get them out of the sides without falling on my ass. There was a small dirty bathroom connected to the room, near the end of the room. The towels, tub, nor toilet seat had been washed in what looked like years. I never used it, I would always use the one in the mini-restaurant at the bottom of the hotel instead.  There was a glass sliding door that led to a balcony that had a lake-side view. It was beautiful, in  all honesty. I could stare at it for hours, wouldn’t I get so bored staring at it. I do art in my spare time, so it made for a decent still life portrait that I would later throw away due to lack of space to keep it.

When I opened my suitcase so I could get out a robe or something else comfortable to sleep in, I was met by a surprise dozen or so house centipedes that had managed to use my luggage to escape certain death. Since I had nothing better to do, and many hours still remained of the day, I chased them all down for the next hour and a half until I was sure every single one was dead. I’m pretty sure Jessie actually managed to find and eat one. After a long day of doing next to nothing but driving and killing house centipedes, I walked over to the barely made bed that the hotel had left me, jumped onto it, laid down, and grabbed the remote next to me. It took me a bit to find something suitable on cable TV, but eventually I found a western movie marathon. I turned it on, and promptly passed out.



 When I awoke, the TV had seemingly turned off by itself. Rather I had done it while half asleep and didn’t remember, or Jessie had turned it off by accident. The lights of cars passing by and other buildings nearby barely were able to illuminate the room, the curtains blocking them. What did light up the room was the still on bathroom light, which I was damn sure I had turned off. For a good minute, I was afraid an intruder had broken in, somehow. But the entrance door was still locked, and there was no way onto the balcony unless someone could climb a flat 7 story brick wall. I slowly arose, grabbing the pen next to my bed, hoping that the pen would somehow threaten the intruder enough for him to leave, or defend me against whatever actual weapon he probably had on him. When I entered the bathroom, there was no human life in there except for me and the shit stains on the toilet seat. I made sure as well to double check every corner of that hotel room and its bathroom, but there was no one there. When I had finally settled down, I looked at the analog clock that glowed a faint red next to the bed I had chosen to sleep in. 4:02 AM, it said. It was late, I was tired and spooked. I wanted to sleep. I used what little energy and consciousness to walk to the bathroom to turn the light off. When I flipped the switch, nothing happened. The switch was broken, which meant even when I shut the bathroom door, there would be a faint glowing white light illuminating almost everything in the room through the cracks of the door. It wasn’t horrible, and I had slept through worse, but that doesn’t mean it wasn’t still annoying. As I went to close the door, I looked at the ground of the bathroom, and saw another house centipede.



When I got home, and the place had been swept in and out by the ULTRA-EXTERMINATORs, I didn’t see another centipede after that.



“By the way, you gots black mold in your basement,” commented one of the employees on their way out. 



He was fat, looked around 40. He sported a brown beard, and brown hair, both were curly. I’d say his hairstyle was between a mohawk and a bowl cut.



“Don’t exterminators usually take care of mold?” I asked the guy, whose name tag read John



“Some do, not our company though. Plus, you only paid for the bugs” he responded



I’d actually never hired exterminators myself, nor been in a house that needed some before this, so I didn’t really know if he was bullshiting me or not. When I went into the basement, there wasn’t a spot of black mold to be found. But, when I entered the storage room next to it, it turns out the company moved much of the things in there, presumably to get all the centipede’s hiding spots. Under where many of the boxes used to be, were indeed splotches of black mold burned into the floor. I didn’t feel like going back to the hotel or spending even more money to get someone to clean it, so over the next few days, I pulled the carpet out and got as much black mold out as I could. The texture was disgusting, it felt like…black mold. But once it was all said and done, I decided while I was at it, I would also reorganize the storage room to be more neat. As it stood, everything was out of place, the Christmas tree was mixed with the Halloween decorations, and bicycles were stabbed with screwdrivers.



 After a while of reorganization and a hundred things I put aside for birthday and Christmas decorations later, I managed to find a few boxes full of sketch books, oil paintings, and sculptures. I decided to sit down and flip through the memories of my arts. I never did it as a profession, but I did occasionally take classes in school. I had become quite good at it, and even occasionally got paid to draw certain things for people in high school. Some of the commissions were still in my possession, one of a person’s pet, one of a couple sitting together, and so on. I also had most of my oil paintings I did for enjoyment when my childhood house lost power during storms. One was of the planet Saturn, lost in the infinite void of space. Another was the snowstorm that cut power to the house itself. I remember I sat outside while I drew it at night, and I got a bad fever for the next couple days. There was a dark blue overtaking the snow, the only illuminance being the light from the lantern next to me. The sky was pitch black, not the moon nor any star managing to bloom through.



 Then there was a painting I didn’t remember creating. Now, I always remember every time I draw something. Even in my early years, in my oldest sketchbooks, I could faintly remember drawing it or being proud of the finished product. But this painting…I didn’t make it. It couldn’t have been mine. The shapes were abstract, but the lighting was very real. It was of some white trapezoid, with black square holes in it occasionally. There were trees around it, red leaves and broken branches. The more I stared, the more I realized the trapezoid looked like the front of my house. The black squares were my windows, and within each and every window was black mold, except for my bedroom window. The sky was completely black. Not black like the winter painting, but complete darkness. I think whoever made the painting had to have had to buy some of that special dark paint that absorbs all light, I'd seen it on youtube once. The grass was all dead, and lying there in the grass was my body, my blood spilling out onto the yellowish dying grass. 



I began to panic. I searched through the rest of the bins, attempting to find any more paintings like this, with no success. A thought crossed my mind that this may have been Brandon’s doing, a bad prank last time he had left. After all, he was known for being a bit of an asshole occasionally when it came to doing things like pranks, but it couldn’t be. The lighting and details were too good for Brandon, hell, they were too good for even me. I searched my mind for even a hint of a memory that I had drawn this, that the memory simply slipped my mind, but nothing. Eventually, I convinced myself I probably did this one while drunk. How else could I have explained it? A person silently broke into my house and drew a detailed and abstract picture of me dead on my lawn and then just left? How silly of me! Plus, I had drawn drunk twice before, but not with as much detail and care as the painting had. But just because I maybe had made the thing did not mean I wanted to keep it around. I got off of my knees, held the painting high in the air, and brought it down to my kneecap, snapping it in half. After which I threw it in a garbage bag by the door of the storage room. 



After I'd say two hours later, I had finished tidying up the room. By the end, I can proudly say it looked slightly better than before. It was still a room with boxes, and a likely awful smell that I had no idea of, and nothing else. I grabbed the trash bags waiting for me at the door, and brought them outside. It was late at night, I could tell by the moon being in the middle of the sky. I had work the next morning at 6, so I frowned at the loss of sleep I already had ahead of me. It was cold for a fall night, the wind blowing unforgivingly and leaves occasionally hitting me. I went around to the side of my house, and threw them into the overflowing trash bin. Before I left, something fell out of one of the bags through a tear. I went to pick it up, and it was the painting I had discovered. This time, I noticed a detail I hadn’t seen before. One of the molds in the window was shaped like a person. At least I think it was a person? It had a long snout, a neck, and the body of a woman. It was strange, sure, but I chalked it up to pattern recognition where there wasn’t any real pattern. When I got back in the house, Jessie was at the top of the staircase. He was whimpering, his tail down, and his ears up.



“What’s wrong boy?” I asked the dog like it would give me an answer.



When all Jessie did was stare back at me with wide eyes for half a second, then immediately stare back at the basement, I thought there must have been an animal that got down there somehow. As I started to walk down, Jessie's whimpering turned into insistent crying, and barking. His feet started to move around like he was getting ready to jump into deep water, but didn’t have the courage to. When I got down there, I only saw the orange lamp illuminating the living room, and one of the basement windows was still open. Had I accidentally left it open while trying to get fresh air? Jessie’s barking was getting louder and more frequent now, occasionally I would hear him try and take the first step down stairs, only to retract his paw and cry like it had been stepped on. When I closed the window, I started searching for whatever critter had scampered down there to escape the cold autumn night. It was only 30 degrees out, and I couldn’t blame a raccoon for wanting out of that. Whatever had snuck down here, I was hoping to release back into the wild at the least. Maybe if it was friendly enough, I would let it stay.

  


 After a bit of searching, I looked under the chair and saw a small figure that wasn’t there before. I tried to use my phone’s flashlight to see it, but it still appeared to be covered in shadow, so I set my phone on the ground, next to me. Thinking this was the animal, I moved the chair off of it to see exactly what it was. But, even with the light of the lamp directly shining on it, I could barely tell what it was. I think it may have been a squirrel due to the long body and small size, but the completely hairless body made it hard to tell. It was charred like coal, stiff, and had curled up into a fetal position. It had no eyes, nails, tongue or lips. I knew it wasn’t there earlier that night because I had moved that chair that very same night earlier so I could get some bigger boxes out. Something brought this in. Something had burnt it.  Killt it. Deliberately hid it. And it got in my house. 

  


My heart was racing, a drumroll in my chest that stinged with each padded beat. My head was hot and the rest of my body was ice cold, as was my blood. Jessie’s barks seemed to get more frequent and louder now that I had uncovered this… desecration of a corpse. A sudden creek behind me echoed through the room, and Jessie went silent. I turned around myself in a frenzy, but only the lamp, the stairs, and the shadows in the room were there. I didn’t know what had left the squirrel in my basement, what it had done to it, but at the moment I didn’t care either. Faster than I ever did before, I ran upstairs, grabbed Jessie, and carried his  70 pound body to my room all in a matter of seconds. I threw Jessie onto my bedsheets, which were messy from a rough night’s sleep, and slammed the door shut behind me. I locked it swiftly, despite my hands shaking. I had to call the police, what else could I have done? I searched both of my pockets for my phone, but I only pulled out a quarter that had a cow skull and “Big Sky Country” engraved next to it on the tail's side. I scrambled around the room, checking each and every place I could have left it. Then it hit me; I had left it in the basement. It was down there, right next to the dead thing that stained my white carpet floor. It was down there with whoever, or whatever, had put the dead thing down there. 

  


I was too scared to leave my room, like when I was young and too afraid to go to the bathroom after I stayed up too late because the creature from my nightmares might get me. So, with nothing else to do, I shut all of my blinds, turned on the ceiling lights, and sat there in my bed. I never fell asleep, couldn’t even if I wanted to. Nearly the whole time me and Jessie stared at the door. He was growling, I sat there, unable to blink. I hadn’t turned on any lights outside of the one in my bedroom, so no indication of movements aside from sound, which was quiet. Not a cricket, or a late night passing car, nor anything else you might hear during the night’s ambience. By morning, light slid through the cracks of the closed curtains, and lights filled the rim of the doorway in front of me. I looked at the digital clock mounted on the side of my bed. In red, bold and bright it read ‘6:06 AM’. My eyes darted back to the door. Right at the bottom, were 2 shadows, barely a few inches apart. After staring at them for a few seconds, They both lifted, making the sounds of naked feet rising off of the wooden floor. They never came back down.

  


I opened the door gently, Jessie at my side. The door wide open, I stared. It was decently bright for 7, the sun and dimly lit blue sky seemingly crashing through the before haunting scenery. Not one unnatural light filled the scene before me save for the bedroom light. I walked around the house, cautiously, exploring each nook and cranny that a person could hide. I had thought of these places myself when bored, exploring where I would hide if some serial killer made a loud front door appearance. When I finished exploring the rest of my house, I went over and looked down the basement stairs. It gave me an uneasy feeling, like I wasn’t welcomed in my own home. Like the feeling you get when you wake up from a nightmare that felt too real. The lights were off. I didn’t do that. I knew someone was in, and very well could still be in my house. I wouldn’t risk going down there to grab my phone. I slowly walked back to my room, making sure to keep direct eye contact with the stairs the whole time.



“Jessie,” I called out towards my room. He decided to sit there the whole time instead of helping me search the house, which I wouldn’t blame him for, “You wanna go for a walk?” I turned around towards my room, facing the doorway which was where he now stood. His ears were perked but his tail wasn’t wagging, almost like he knew this was an escape attempt. It took me a moment to notice, but once I did, my heart just about stopped. Hand prints above my doorway. They were dirty, charcoal like. As an artist, I knew charcoal from dirt or any other black material. It had been smudged above the doorway on the wall and on the ceiling. I froze. I was almost unable to process what I was seeing. A bark from Jessie broke my trance, and I stared at him just as he stared at me, intently.



“Let’s go boy.” I said, and hastefully walked towards the front door. Jessie quickly followed, following me outside onto the front porch. It was still cold, the wind was still blowing, but less harshly now. I opened the back door of the car, and Jessie jumped in eager to leave. I looked back at the house one more time before leaving. My bedroom window curtains were now wide open. Charcoal prints stained the glass, pressed hard, as if trying to push through. I jumped into the front seat, started the car, and drove off.



I drove to Brandon's place, only around 40 minutes away. I told him everything that had happened, and he thought it was 'cool'. He always liked the paranormal, and he said he'd be ""Ready to tackle it with me once I'm ready"". He let me borrow his phone to call the police, and take care of some other things while I was at it. I decided to post this story to see if anyone has any knowledge on who, or what, could this have been. I'll try to update in the future, but for now, goodbye.",4,1730406856.0,nosleep,0,0.84,False
1ggod6b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mononucleosis/comments/1ggod6b/weird_symptoms/,Weird symptoms?,"Hi everyone! Want to preface this by saying that I am talking to my doctor. 

Last week, (Friday, it’s not Thursday) I went to the ER. I was having abdominal pain, throwing up and diarrhea. I went to the er because my throw up was dark? I wish I had a picture, it wasn’t exactly coffee grounds, but dark and strange looking. Not a normal throw up. My fever was low grade when I got there but spiked throughout the day. I had fever and chills too. I vomited multiple times while at the ER. I was also EXHAUSTED. 

I ended up being there for a while. They did a CT scan and said my spleen was a bit enlarged with lymph nodes. The doctor diagnosed me with mono. 

The next two days I have little to no appetite and have some diarrhea. I also am super fatigued. Sunday I start to feel better. It is now Thursday and I’m pretty much back to normal. I’m constipated (probably from taking zofran) and a little tired, but nothing crazy. 

My doctor sent me for bloodwork (normal) and a mono test/EBV test. The EBV test came back high on all of them. I’m not sure exactly what this means but my friend who is a nurse seems to think I am currently fighting off mono and have had it in the past. My doctor also sent me to a hematologist, who basically laughed off the symptoms and didn’t understand the referral. 

Now here’s my thing: I am SUPER stressed because of all of this. I don’t understand the spike in mono symptoms and then just going away? And I also bruised badly from the bloodwork. I am stressed that this is something more serious… specifically I’m worried about lymphoma due to my primary sending me to the hematologist. Am I insane?! I’m literally feeling itchy out of nowhere because I read that this is a sign of lymphoma.

Your parent’s fighting. The screaming. Yelling. Banging. You didn’t know to hide or to watch to make sure things didn’t go too far.

In school, you ate alone. You wanted to fit in, but they knew something was… off. Your step mother meaning well, “there’s nothing wrong with her” trying to avoid a label. Because after all, a label meant disabled. Disabled means you’ll never be able to find a job. Or live alone. Or work. Or get Married. So no, she says, there’s nothing wrong. She doesn’t need smaller classes. Doesn’t need a social worker.

So instead you fell through the cracks. School just didn’t make sense, and you know you’re not dumb, but why do you feel so stupid all the time? 

“Your sister, she has friends! What’s wrong with you?” your father asks. “Why don’t you dress better? Do something with your hair? Why don’t you care about your appearance?” The family taunts, all together.

You begin to cry. It’s 3 against 1. Your cries are met with more critique “why are you crying?? We aren’t even saying anything bad??” So now you feel insane, and crying worse. They don’t stop until you’re a sobbing mess. No hugs, no comfort. Just judgmental looks. You even ask for a hug, they all sit and stare.

So you enter the world with self esteem in the negatives. But the world isn’t even nearly as cruel as your upbringing. It’s odd.

If I needed to do and change so much, why aren’t people asking this of me? My coworkers are happy to see me. They smile at me. One brings me coffee. 
I am so confused and feel lucky, instead of feeling deserving.

Blood is thicker than water, but water is quenching your thirst. You’re not a child but a young woman, and confused by kind people. But you feel good. So you start to do your hair pretty.

1ggoa6k,https://www.reddit.com/r/expats/comments/1ggoa6k/canadian_couple_looking_for_relaxed_rural_life_by/,"Canadian couple looking for relaxed, rural life by the sea","Hi, we are 28F and 33M, looking to leave BC, Canada for a warmer, more connected culture. We are eligible for Youth Mobility Visas (Working Holiday Visas) for many countries, including a lot of Europe, Oceania, Southeast Asia, as well as Chile and Costa Rica. My partner will be aging out of the program soon, so we are looking to take advantage of this starting sometime in 2025 when we can have paperwork and such sorted.

Most of the posts I see on here are city people asking about moving from one large city to another. We are both small town people though, and would prefer to live in another small town (ideally less than 10,000 people - we have lived in towns of 500 people and enjoyed it). Neither of us have done much travelling, nor can we really afford to, so we are trying to do as much research as possible in choosing where to go. For example, we would rather move to Europe for a full year or longer than to visit for 3 months because of expensive flight costs. So visiting a place before deciding to move is not something we want to do, and we're open to moving multiple times within the limited timeframe we have to use this special visa if we don't mesh well with our first choices.

As for work, we are thinking of WWOOFing (World Wide Organization of Organic Farmers) to trade room and board and learning farm skills for working on someone's farm. I am almost finished training to be able to work as a freelance editor, though I know many countries don't allow that on the Youth Mobility Visa, so I would likely end up farming or working customer service jobs until my partner ages out and we have to get a different kind of working visa to stay somewhere. My partner is a 4th class power engineer (maintains boiler systems that produce steam power, such as for hospitals or factories), but he also has his journeyman plumber ticket, gasfitting ticket, and knows some basic electrical and HVAC systems. He wants to ""collect"" trades, so learning a new trade appeals to him a lot too.

What we dislike about Canada: (read first sentence of each only for tl;dr)

* People are polite but disinterested. Making friends is difficult because you could have a great conversation with someone and even exchange numbers, but then they make up excuses to never see you again despite telling you ""we should meet up, go do x together, etc""
* People are too individualistic. When I was a kid, getting to know your neighbours was more common, but now we have so many people from cities or other provinces or other countries who are fine with living next to someone for 5+ years and never know each other's names. It's really isolating and I wish there were more community groups and events that don't revolve around markets to buy things. There is also a common mentality of ""not my problem"" when people see something where they could directly help, like litter on the street or a lost child.
* Parenting is weird now; kids aren't taught life skills. We're not parents, nor do we plan to be, but it's bizarre that children are no longer allowed to walk two blocks down the street between their home and school without an adult anymore. Schools will not allow your child to leave the property unless an adult picks them up, unless they live somewhere they can take a school bus, in which case the parents are expected to take them to and from the bus. Plus many other things like that. It's created this bizarre situation where children don't learn many skills required to function independently anymore, so we have more and more young adults who have never made a doctor's appointment, never cooked a meal, never used public transit, never been grocery shopping, etc etc. I would prefer to live somewhere that treats children as young people with various levels of responsibilities and freedoms, instead of expecting them to be completely useless and incompetent until they're 18 and suddenly need to magically transform into an adult over night. I also think the education system here sucks, but that's a whole other rant.
* Healthcare requires too much time and persuasion to get anything checked out here. If you have a family doctor, an appointment might take 2 months to get. Otherwise you have to wait at the hospital for 6+ hours to be seen, and waitlists to get a family doctor are 4+ years. Then, the doctor is highly likely to say ""oh yeah all these symptoms could be something serious, but it's probably not, so I won't order any tests. If it gets worse, come back and I'll consider running 1 test out of 5 recommended tests for your issues, and if that's negative then I'll declare you healthy and that it's all just in your head."" I have been told I ""probably have"" x, y, z chronic health issues from my doctor but she hasn't run any tests to officially diagnose. I was told at age 11 that I ""probably have low blood sugar"" because I kept fainting, so I've lived my life thinking I'm hypoglycemic, only to find out this year (finally got a blood sugar test) that I don't at all and now it's ""probably"" a heart thing. No heart tests of course, except listening with a stethoscope. I don't need great healthcare, and am fine even with alternative medicine practices, as long as someone is willing to do look into something instead of dismissing me completely.
* People are in too much of a rush. I like laid-back living. I'm used to ""island time"" which means showing up half an hour late is not a big deal, but that culture has pretty much died and been replaced by the city mentality of ""if you're not 5 minutes early, you're late."" We both have ADHD and our time blindness can be rough. I don't mesh well with people who take it as a personal attack that I arrived to a cafe at 2:10 if we said we'd meet for a casual coffee ""around 2.""

Honestly, I could go on and on, but these are the main points I can think of at the moment. We are super open about where we go, we would just like some degree of safety (I like to walk by myself), and a much more connected and friendly culture. Politically, we align decently with Northern Europe, but culturally, I don't think we do (except liking straightforward communication). And we don't really match either politics or culture here in Canada, so gaining one or the other seems ideal. We are both willing to learn a new language to use primarily.

As for weather and geography, I love being by the ocean, I would love to live somewhere I can walk along a beach daily. I also like the rain, I'm used to long and grey winters. I don't like ice, don't mind some snow, but overall prefer an above 0 C winter. My partner likes sunshine and flat fields, since he's from Alberta, whereas I'm a coastal mountainous rainforest kind of person. He cares less about where we live than I do though. I could get used to lots of sunshine and flat land, as long as there's a beach and some trees. I would not be happy somewhere with mostly pavement and no nature trails or natural areas to spend time in.

Okay full TL;DR: Young couple wants to move from rural and coastal BC, Canada to rural and coastal ??? that has warm people who look out for each other, and more of a simple, laid-back lifestyle. Perks if housing is affordable enough to live in a simple shack (we're up for building ourselves) on an acre or more to start a hobby farm - we are okay with off-grid.

Any suggestions where we should look into? Also interested in hearing recommendations about countries not on the list, since we could potentially get into somewhere with a different visa type.

Edit: Since I guess it wasn't clear enough - we are looking to move permanently to another country. The Youth Mobility Visa is just an easy way into one of these countries, and the farming is also a simple way to find initial housing, meet people, spend less money, etc while we sort out getting established in our careers of being a WFH editor and a multi-skilled tradesman. We are looking for opinions on where we might blend well into the culture, and are hoping to hear some recommendations to narrow down the long list of places we've been researching. We have already been researching Spain, Portugal, Denmark, Netherlands, Germany, Croatia, etc etc but would love to hear some opinions from people about RURAL living, because most research has resulted in ""this massive city is great compared to this other massive city"" which is frankly not helpful.

Edit 2: I don't understand where all the downvotes are coming from, I'm following the rules of the sub. If you want more specific questions, here's a list of the many questions I have:

1. Do you find the people in coastal, rural Spain to be friendly and welcoming to new people who make a big effort to integrate? (replace with Portugal, Italy, Croatia, Denmark, Costa Rica, Germany, Netherlands, Chile, Taiwan, Ireland, South Korea, or France and apply to all questions)
2. Do you know your neighbours?
3. Is it common to see people walk by trash on the ground?
4. Are there community groups and festivals where you do more than buy things?

1ggo9rn,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1ggo9rn/friends_and_family_a_new_beginning_chapter_23/,"Friends and Family: A New Beginning, Chapter 23 (Part 2)","Sydney fixed breakfast the next morning.  Jim smelled it as he made his way downstairs.  Bacon and pancakes.  Lauren and Lindsay were already at the table.  The kitchen radio was playing some classic country.  The Bellamy Brothers.  *When I’m Away From You*.  Jim asked Lauren and Lindsay, “Where are your other sisters?”

Lauren answered, “Chelsea’s in her room, and she’s finishing up on packing her bag for her weekend with Natalie and Megan.  Mine’s already packed.  Valerie and Caitlyn are getting showers, and they’re getting ready for school.”

Jim said, “That’s good.  Because I need to ask you girls something.  And you too, Sydney.”

Chelsea, Valerie and Caitlyn showed up for breakfast.  Just as the girls were eating breakfast, Jim said, “Chelsea and Lauren, I know you two will be staying with Natalie and Megan this weekend.  I hope you two have a good time with them.”

Chelsea said, “Thanks, Dad.  We’ll be studying mostly.  But we will make some time for some fun.”

Then Jim asked, “Lindsay, Valerie and Caitlyn, how would you three like to hang out with your Nana Wendy and your aunts Emily and Charlie this weekend?”

Caitlyn excitedly asked, “Can we, Dad?”

Then Valerie asked, “Yes, can we, Dad?”

Jim said, “Yes, girls.  I figured you girls would like to spend a weekend with them.  How about it, girls?”

Lindsay answered, “Yes, Dad.  We’d love to.”

Then Jim said, “Okay, then.  I’ll drive you girls there after school this afternoon.  When you girls get done with your breakfast, I want you three to pack a bag.  Then I’ll drive you all to school.”

After they finished their breakfast, all five girls went upstairs.  While Sydney loaded the dishwasher, Jim said to her, “Sydney, I spoke to your mother last night.  She would like for you to go shopping with her this Saturday morning.”

“Sure, Jim.  It would be nice to spend some time with Mom.”

“Angelina, Quinn and Claire will be going along.  Ariel has to work Saturday.  Your mother’s going to try and get Kendra to go along.”

“Where will we be going?” Sydney asked.

Jim answered, “She said the outlet mall in Gaffney.”

“Good.  I like that place.  I may even buy a few things while I’m there.”

“That’ll be good.  I figured you’d like to spend some time with your family.”

Chelsea walked down the stairs with her bag.  Lauren walked behind her with her bag, and what appeared to be two dresses in clear plastic bags.  Jim asked them, “Are you two about to leave?”

Chelsea answered, “Yes, Dad.  We are.  We’re going to put our bags in my car.  I’m about to drive Lauren to school.”

Then Lauren said, “Dad, I’m carrying my dress and Chelsea’s.  Are you going to be okay here by yourself this weekend?”

“Yes, but Sydney will be here with me some.  She’s going shopping with her family tomorrow.  She may spend some time with her family on Sunday also.  I’ll be here doing some stuff around the house.”

You had to admire Jim Faulkner for being creative.  He darn sure wasn’t about to tell his daughters about his plans for this weekend.  Jim felt he pulled it off quite well.  So far, no one knew a thing.  And that included his five daughters.          

Jim walked outside with Chelsea and Lauren.  They put their bags in the small trunk of Chelsea’s Camaro.  Lauren carefully laid the dresses across the back seat.  Chelsea and Lauren both gave Jim a hug and a kiss on his cheek.  Jim asked them, “Are you two going to be okay this weekend at that apartment?”

Chelsea started up the car.  The radio was playing.  Boz Scaggs.  *Love, Look What You’ve Done To Me*.  Lauren said, “Yes, Dad.  We’ll be okay.  After all, we will be with Natalie and Megan.”

That was when they saw Morgan running to Jim’s driveway.  Morgan gave Jim a hug, and then she asked, “Chelsea and Lauren, can I get a ride to school?”

Chelsea and Lauren both looked at Morgan, and they smiled at her.  Lauren said, “Okay, Morgan.  Get in the back.  But please watch those dresses.”

Morgan gingerly moved the dresses, and she sat down in the back seat.  Lauren said, “Dad, we best get going or we’ll be late for school.”

Then Chelsea said, “Yes, let’s get going.  Dad, I may call you on your cell phone when I get to the apartment.”

“Sure, Chelsea.  Do you have to work at Walgreen’s today?”

“Yes, Dad.  Eleven to four.”

“Okay, honey.  You two have a good time with Natalie and Megan.”

“Okay, Dad.  We will.”      

“Chelsea, you best be going before that traffic gets bad.”

Jim stepped back, and Chelsea backed her car onto Bethany Street.  Then Jim watched Chelsea drive to East Morehead Street.  Jim walked back to the house.  Just as he got inside, the other three girls walked into the living room.  They announced they were ready to go to school.  Then Sydney said, “I best be getting on to work.  I know Rachel’s about there, and she’ll be waiting on me.  She counts on me to have the coffee ready.”

“Okay, honey.  I’ll see you this evening.”

Jim and Sydney gave each other a kiss.  Sydney left the house in her red Camaro.  Jim said, “Okay, girls.  Let’s roll.”

Lindsay, Valerie and Caitlyn walked out of the house first.  Jim locked up the house.  He told them to get into the Cadillac Escalade.  Caitlyn said, “I get to sit in front next to Dad.”

Valerie said, “No way, Caitlyn.  I’m riding shotgun.”

Then Jim said, “Lindsay’s sitting in the front.  You two sit in the back, just like you always do.”

After the girls got in and buckled up, Jim drove to East Morehead Street.  His first stop was Dilworth Elementary School, where he would drop off Valerie and Caitlyn.  Valerie said, “Dad, you know our bags are at the house.”

“Yes, Valerie.  I’ll take you to the house to pick up your bags after school.”

Valerie and Caitlyn gave Jim a kiss before they got out of the Escalade.  Jim told them he would be leaving work early and that he would pick them up as soon as he got off.  From Dilworth Elementary, Jim drove Lindsay to Radcliffe Middle School by way of East Boulevard and Queens Road West.  As Jim turned onto West Boulevard, Lindsay asked, “Dad, is there something me and my sisters need to know?”

“Why would you ask me that?”

“I don’t know.  We’ve all noticed how you’ve been acting a little strange lately.”

“Lindsay, there’s nothing for you and your sisters to worry about.”

“Then why are you sending me and my two younger sisters to Nana Wendy’s house?”

“I just figured you girls would like to spend some time with her and your aunts.  Besides, I’ve been wanting to do some stuff around the house.  I figured this would be a good time to get it all done.”

Lindsay looked at Jim some.  Then she said, “Okay, Dad.  But if there’s something we need to know, you would tell us, would you?”

“Yes, Lindsay.  I would.  As I said, there’s nothing for you and your sisters to worry about.”

Jim made the turn from Queens Road West to Radcliffe Avenue.  Jim and Lindsay did not speak from the time he crossed Kenilworth Avenue on East Boulevard to the time he dropped Lindsay off at Radcliffe Middle School.  When he dropped her off, Lindsay finally said, “Bye, Dad.  You will pick me up after work, won’t you?”

“Yes, Lindsay.  I’ll pick up Valerie and Caitlyn first.  Then I’ll come here and pick you up.  We’ll stop by the house and let you get your bags.”

“Okay, Dad.  See you then.  I best go, or I’ll be late to my first class.”

Lindsay headed inside the school.  Jim drove back to East Boulevard.  On the way to Queen City Chevrolet, Jim wondered if he broke the hearts of his five girls.  After all, he did not tell them the truth.  Just as he wanted to keep his plan to propose to Sydney a secret from his friends, he wanted to keep it a secret from his family as well.  And that included his daughters.  The only ones who knew about his plan were Autumn and her kids (except for Sydney, of course).  Jim hoped Autumn and her three oldest have been keeping that secret. 

Jim arrived at the dealership.  He went straight to his office.  From his office, he saw Mark, Simon and Jonathan at the door.  He let them in.  It was already opening time, so Jim left the door unlocked.  He turned on the music for the loudspeakers.  As soon as Jim got settled behind his desk, he got a call on his cell phone.  It was Autumn.  She said, “Jim, I just got to work.  We’ll be getting our first patient of the day in about a few minutes.  I just figured I’d use this time to call you and ask you if Sydney would be joining us tomorrow.”

“Yes, Autumn.  I asked this morning.  She said she would be happy to join you.  It sounds like she’s looking forward to it.”

“Okay, Jim.  That’s good.  And just so you know, I have been keeping your secret from everyone.  I’m sure Mark, Simon and Alex have also.”

“Thanks, Autumn.  And I need to ask you something else.  Can you please have Sydney back at my house around five or six tomorrow evening?”

“Jim, I think that’s a can do.  We’ll leave Gaffney around four.  We may get something to eat at one of the restaurants in the outlet mall.”

“That’s great, Autumn.  But please don’t let Sydney fill up.  Try to remember that I am fixing a special dinner.”

“Yes, Jim.  We’ll probably get something small like nachos, chicken tenders or cheese sticks.”

“Okay, Autumn.  That’ll sound good.  I’m going to let you go.  Please remember to continue keeping my secret, okay?”

“Yes, Jim.  I will.  I’ll talk to you some more later.”

Just as Jim ended the phone call, Mark stepped into the office.  Jim told him to close the door and take a seat.  Jim said, “I just got off the phone with your mother.  She’s taking Sydney to Gaffney so that I can get the house ready for our special evening.”

Mark said, “Yes, Jim.  I’ve been keeping your secret.  Even Kendra and the girls don’t know about it.”

Jim said, “Thanks, Mark.  I’m glad you and Simon are off tomorrow.  You two and Alex and a few of our friends are going to spend tomorrow helping me get everything ready, including that thing in the utility room.”

“You mean with the die-cast metal cars.”

“Yes.  That.”

Mark said, “Jim, I know you’ll pull this thing off well.  Sydney will be so happy.”

Mark left and went back to work.  Jim saw a deputy from the Mecklenburg County Sheriff’s Department walk into the dealership.  The deputy spoke to Jonathan, and he directed the deputy to Jim’s office.  The deputy told Jim that his patrol car, which was a Chevy Caprice, had been making a terrible noise and it would probably need a new serpentine belt.  Jim directed the deputy to the service department.  He called Joseph Daniels in the service department, and he told him the deputy was coming with his police car.  The deputy thanked Jim and shook his hand.

Jim took his lunch hour a little early.  He ate at a nearby Jersey Mike’s Subs.  He had a Big Kahuna with potato chips and a large iced tea.  There was smooth jazz playing on the loudspeaker, which seemed to brighten Jim’s day.  During his lunch hour, Jim video chatted with Sydney.  She was on her lunch hour also.  Sydney was at a Burger King in Huntersville, just north of Charlotte.  Jim told Sydney about how his day was going.  Sydney told Jim she was with the president of the Charlotte Pet Food Company, who was one of her clients.  Jim cut the video chat short, and Sydney went back to work.  A few minutes later, Jim went back to the car dealership.

During the next four hours, Jim sold a new Chevy truck and a used Buick, and he also tried to catch up on some paperwork.  Just before Jim left, he checked his computer.  Facebook.  He got a friend request.  It was from Charity Donovan (but it was under the name Charity Donovan Loudermilk).  The female drag racer Jim and Simon were talking about recently.  From what was on her profile, Charity did more than drag race.  She was also a Christian singer.  Charity also raced at smaller racetracks around Charlotte.  Charity was currently living in Charlotte.  There were pictures of Charity with two race cars, her black 1966 Chevy Nova drag car and a mid-eighties Monte Carlo, which she used for dirt track racing.  One of the photo albums on her Facebook page featured some “glamour shots.”  Charity was in all of them.  Another photo album showed Charity racing, and some of the photos were taken at various dirt racetracks and drag strips.  There were also photos of her two kids, a little boy and a teenage girl.  Charity was already friends with nearly all of Jim’s friends and relatives, so that prompted Jim to accept Charity’s friend request. 

It was now three o’ clock.  After Jim got done with his Facebook page, he turned off his computer and locked up his office.  Jim left Mark in charge for the rest of the day.  On the way out, Jim told Mark and Jonathan about his Facebook request from Charity Donovan Loudermilk.  Mark and Jonathan were also friends with Charity.  Mark said, “Jim, that’s good.  You know Charity always thought highly of you.”

Jim said, “Yes, Mark.  She did have a crush on me when I was younger.”

Jonathan said, “Really, Jim?  I didn’t know that.”

“Jonathan, that was before you and your bunch came to Charlotte,” Jim said.

Jonathan said, “Yes, Jim.  I guess there were a lot of things that happened here before we came to Charlotte.”

Jim laughed a little, and then he said, “Okay, Mark and Jonathan.  You guys close and lock up the place.”

Mark and Jonathan agreed.  Jim got in his Cadillac Escalade, and he drove onto South Tryon Street.  The radio was playing top 40 and classic soft rock.  Just before he made the left turn onto West Boulevard, Jim heard a song that sounded familiar to him.  John Lennon.  *Imagine there’s no heaven*.  That was the song Jim heard when he and Candi started going steady.  That was back on Easter Sunday of 1984.  Jim thought he would shed a tear.  He didn’t.  Instead, he smiled.  And he thought of Sydney.  Tomorrow evening, Jim would play some music when he had his special dinner with Sydney.  The DJ on Lite ‘N Easy 102 (the station Jim was listening to) announced that the station was playing classic soft rock all weekend.  Jim seemed pleased with that.  Jim thought, *That sounds like a winner.  Maybe I’ll play some music like that for Sydney tomorrow evening*.           

Jim got ready to turn right onto South Boulevard.  But before he could, he had to wait on a Charlotte Lynx Blue Line train to pass.  After the train passed, he saw the Walgreen’s where Chelsea worked.  He wondered if Chelsea was there working, stocking shelves and tending to the checkout.  Jim tried to see if Chelsea’s dark gray Camaro was in the parking lot.  But before he could, the light turned green and he had to make the right turn onto South Boulevard. 

Jim drove straight to Radcliffe Middle School to pick up Lindsay.  Jim wondered if Lindsay was upset with him.  Just before he dropped her off, she asked him if there was a secret she needed to know.  Of course, Jim was about to propose marriage to Sydney.  But he still did not want anyone knowing about it right now, including his daughters and his other relatives.  But right now, the only relative who knew about Jim’s plan to propose to Sydney was Wendy, and she agreed to keep it a secret.  Jim told Lindsay there was nothing to worry about, and that she and her two younger sisters should spend some time with Wendy, Emily and Charlie.

Jim stopped in front of Radcliffe Middle School.  Lindsay was already sitting on one of the benches, waiting for him.  Lindsay got in the Escalade.  She sat in the front passenger seat.  He asked her how her day went.  She said it went okay.  Then Jim asked her, “Lindsay, you’re not upset with me, are you?”

“No, Dad.  Why would you ask me a question like that?”

“Oh, nothing.  After you asked me about this weekend, you didn’t speak to me until I dropped you off at school.”

“Oh, Dad.  It wasn’t you.  You’ll just have to forgive me.  I guess I got a lot on my plate right now.”

“Is everything okay at school?”

“Dad, there’s some turmoil at school.  One of our best teachers is about to be fired for reasons we’re still not sure of.  And one of my fellow students in my math class has cancer and there’s some talk he may not be back in school, or even make it.”

“Is it that serious?”

“Yes, Dad.  He’s in Carolinas Medical Center.  From what I’ve been hearing, his cancer is getting worse.”

Jim stopped at the traffic light.  Just before he made the turn onto East Boulevard, Jim said, “Lindsay, I just hope it doesn’t get any worse.  I don’t think I can imagine being that young and being sick like that.”

Then Lindsay said, “Dad, you still didn’t tell me the real reason why you wanted me and my two younger sisters to stay with Nana Wendy and Aunt Emily and Aunt Charlie.”

“Lindsay, it’s just like I said to you girls.  I just thought you would like to spend some time with them.  I know you all haven’t been spending a whole time with them.  Chelsea and Lauren have some studying to do and they’re staying with Natalie and Megan.”

“Is that the only reason?”

“Sydney has to work for a special client, and I’ve been wanting to get some stuff done around the house.  I figured this could be a good weekend to get it all done.”

“Okay, Dad.  If you say so.  I trust you.  So do my sisters.”

“Thanks, Lindsay.  That’s good to know.”

Then, an old R&B song with a beautiful sound came over the radio.  Lindsay wanted to change the station.  Jim gently touched her hand, and he said, “Whoa, Lindsay.  Don’t change it.”

“Why, Dad?”

“That sounds like a beautiful song.  I’d like to hear it.  I don’t think I’ve ever heard it before.”

Jim was right.  He had never heard that song before.  That song played the whole time he drove from the bridge crossing Little Sugar Creek to Dilworth Elementary School.  Jim wondered two things.  What was the name of the song, and who sings it?  Maybe he’d download it onto his iPod.  When Jim got to Dilworth Elementary, both questions were answered.  The Manhattans.  *There’s No Me Without You*.  It was beautiful, and he felt he would play it for Sydney tomorrow evening.  Jim felt he would make a choice between two songs to play when he popped the question.  That one, or maybe “Imagine” by John Lennon.  He would answer that question tomorrow morning or afternoon. 

When Jim got to Dilworth Elementary, Valerie and Caitlyn were already at the curb, waiting for him.  He asked them how their day went.  Valerie said, “It was okay.  We had pizza, fries and salad for lunch.  Me and my best friend, Ella, played on the swings.  We talked about how cool it was to see the Charlotte skyline when we swung.”

Jim said, “That’s nice.  But did you learn anything in school?  After all, you do go to school to learn.”

Valerie said, “Oh, yes.  I’m finally getting the hang of division.  And my teacher said starting Monday, we’ll be learning about all the states, their capitals, and their main industries.  Starting with North Carolina, of course.”

Then Caitlyn said, “I had my spelling test today.  I made a hundred.  I also had a math test, and I got a ninety on it.”

“Honey, that’s good.  You just keep doing your best,” Jim said.

Jim pulled into his driveway.  Just before everyone got out of the Escalade, he said, “Girls, we got a little time on our hands, so get everything together you are going to need.  We’ll leave for your Nana Wendy’s shortly.”

Jim went into the house first.  The three girls went in behind him.  Jim went into the kitchen.  He checked the answering machine.  There were two messages.  The first one was from Chelsea.  *Hi, Dad.  It’s Chelsea. As soon as I get off work, I’ll go to Queen Charlotte High and get Lauren so you won’t have to.*  *I’ll take her to the apartment from there.  Please call me and let me know you got this message.  Bye.  I love you, Dad*. 

The next message was from Emily.  *Hey, Jim.  This is Emily.  Mom and Charlie and I are looking forward to seeing Lindsay, Valerie and Caitlyn.  I need you to call me on my cell phone as soon as you get this message.  Hope to hear from you as soon as possible.  Love you.  Bye.*

Jim returned the calls.  He called Chelsea first.  She said, “Hi, Dad.  I picked up Lauren.  We just got to the apartment.”

“That’s good.  I just thought I’d call you and let you know I got your message.  I just got home with your three youngest sisters.”

“That’s good, Dad.  Are they looking forward to their weekend with Nana Wendy and our aunts?”

“Yes, they are.  I got a message from Emily.  I got to call her back.”

Chelsea said, “Okay, Dad.  Thanks for calling me back.  I’ll let you go so you can call her.”

Jim said, “Yes, sure.  Take care and please call me if you and Lauren need anything.  Say hello to Natalie and Megan for us.”

Chelsea said, “Yes, Dad.  I will.”

After he ended the phone call with Chelsea, he called Emily.  She said, “Hi, Jim.  I’m still at work but you’re lucky you caught me on break.”

“Yes, Emily.  You told me to call you.”

“Yes, Jim.  I’ll be getting off work at six and I'm wondering something.”

“Sure, Emily.  What is it?”

“I was wondering if you would like to bring those girls to where I work.  I would like to take you all to dinner if that’s possible.”

“Sure, Emily.  I guess that’ll be okay.”

“I’ll ask Mom and Charlie if they’d like to join us.”

“Sure, Emily.  What restaurant have you got in mind?”

“Whatever we have in mind.  I may let Mom decide.”

“Okay, Jim.  Are Chelsea and Lauren going to be joining us?”

“No.  Chelsea and Lauren are spending the weekend with Natalie and Megan McClendon at their apartment.”

“Oh, okay.  Jim, I’ll see you and your three youngest daughters soon.”

Jim ended the phone call just as he saw Lindsay walking down the stairs, carrying her guitar.  Lindsay looked at Jim, and she said to him, “Dad, I just figured I’d take my guitar and practice on it some.”

Jim said, “That’s good, Lindsay.  Everyone loves to hear you play your guitar.”

Then Lindsay said, “I’ll be back to get my clothes and my bag.”

Then, Caitlyn walked down the stairs.  She was wearing one of prettiest dresses, a pink dress with puffed sleeves and a big bow.  Jim smiled as she saw her.  Right away, that song he heard earlier from The Manhattans played in his head.  Jim felt a lump in throat, and he thought it was about the size of a tomato.  He tried his absolute best to fight back tears, maybe because he knew he wouldn’t be seeing his daughters during the weekend.  With a few deep breaths, Jim got his composure back.  Maybe seeing Caitlyn in that pretty dress gave Jim those feelings of sadness.  Jim said, “Caitlyn, honey.  You do look pretty in that dress.”

“Thank you, Dad,” Caitlyn said.

Then Valerie showed up.  She was wearing a T-shirt.  She was also wearing a denim skirt.  But this time, she put it on voluntarily.  No one told her to put on that skirt.  Jim said, “Valerie, you look good.  I cannot believe you put on a skirt without anyone having to tell you.”

Just as Lindsay was making her way upstairs, Valerie said, “Thanks, Dad.  All my pants are dirty.  Lindsay gave me this skirt a while back.  It’s all I had to wear.”

Jim said, “Okay, Valerie.  I’m just glad you are wearing a skirt.  But I wish you had left your dirty clothes in the laundry room for Svetlana to clean.”

Valerie said, “Dad, that was my fault.  I guess I forgot to leave them out.”

Then Jim said to all three of them, “Okay.  Why don’t you girls get your dirty clothes together?  I’m sure Nana Wendy will be happy to wash them.”

Valerie said, “Okay, Dad.  I’ll head back upstairs and get my clothes together.”

The girls had everything together and loaded into the Escalade.  They left the house.  Jim got onto Interstate 77 south.  Even though it was now the evening rush hour, Jim had no trouble driving the fifty-five mile an hour speed limit on I-77.  He also had no trouble on Interstate 485, which he took to the exit for Johnston Road, which took him to Ballantyne.  Just as he got off I-485, Emily called him on his cell phone.  Jim put it on speakerphone and said, “Hi, Emily.  Have you all decided on where to have dinner?”

“Yes, Jim.  Can you meet us at McAlister’s Deli?”

“Yes, Emily.  That sounds good.”

Jim pulled into the shopping center where the restaurant was located.  It was a place Jim had eaten at before, and usually when he was in Ballantyne when he was Wendy and his half-sisters.  In fact, it was Wendy who introduced him to it.  It didn’t take Jim long to find Wendy’s BMW.  He parked next to it. 

Jim and the girls went inside.  Wendy already had a table ready.  Emily and Charlie were at the table with her.  They had yet to order their food.  Jim got kids meals for Valerie and Caitlyn.  Lindsay wanted a salad with a vinaigrette dressing, a bag of chips and a Coke.  Jim chose a cheddar broccoli soup in a bread bowl, a small salad with blue cheese dressing and a Coke (Jim thought it was perfect weather for the soup since it was rather chilly outside).  Wendy got her a club sandwich and chips.  Emily and Charlie each got a salad.  Wendy got an iced tea, and Emily and Charlie each got a Diet Coke.

Jim said grace, and then everyone ate.  Jim said, “Mom, I hope you and my half-sisters are okay with my three youngest girls staying with you this weekend.”

Wendy said, “Yes, Jim.  You know you are all welcome at my house.”

Then Emily asked Jim, “How are things going between you and Sydney?”

Jim tried to find an answer to that question.  But he did not want to reveal his plans for this weekend to anyone at the table.  He did say, “Oh, everything’s going great.  Sydney’s been quite a help around the house.  She cleans up after herself.  And she’s really good around the girls.”

Charlie said, “That’s good.  It’s good when someone loves kids.”

Jim said, “You bet it is, Charlie.  I always said this.  If anyone cannot love kids, it can be a sorry world.”

“You bet it is,” Wendy said.

They continued to eat.  About an hour later, they went back out to the parking lot.  Lindsay, Valerie and Caitlyn put their stuff in the trunk of Wendy’s car.  The three girls did ask Wendy if they could have their laundry done this weekend at her house.  Wendy said she would be glad to do her laundry as soon as they got there.  Jim did not know Charlie’s car was there also.  She was now driving an early-nineties model Mercedes, a car she bought only four weeks ago.  There was not enough room in Wendy’s BMW, so Charlie asked at least one of the girls to ride with her.  Two of them agreed.  Valerie and Caitlyn.  Lindsay would ride with Wendy and Emily.  Wendy asked Jim if he wanted to come to her house.  Jim said, “Thanks, but I best be getting on to my house.”

“Okay, Jim.  But please call me and let me know you got home okay.”

“Okay, Mom.  I will.”

Wendy’s BMW was the first one out of the parking lot, followed by Charlie’s Mercedes.  Jim drove behind Charlie.  It was dark, so Jim was not able to see Caitlyn in the back seat.  Valerie was in the front seat beside Charlie.

Jim drove back to Dilworth.  He had a lot on his mind, so he decided to take Ballantyne Commons Parkway and Rea Road instead of I-485.  He also took Providence Road until it turned into Queens Road.  Queens Road eventually turned into East Morehead Street.  During the time he drove from Ballantyne to Dilworth, Jim kept the radio on Lite ‘N Easy 102, listening to the music he grew up with.  Nearly all the songs made Jim feel good.  A few didn’t.  But Jim knew he had to keep his equilibrium because he had a girlfriend to propose marriage to tomorrow evening.",2,1730406598.0,writers,1,1.0,False

It seems fine when I add the hot water, and I finish preparing it with whatever my milk of choice is that day and sugar. Then when I'm drinking it, I see some of the coffee powder(?) at the bottom of my mug. I stir but it eventually happens again, so now I stir before every sip just in case. I've never had that happen with instant coffee from other brands, so I was surprised.

I love helping the kids enjoy holidays with special activities, but they get SO wild on special occasions and I always end spending so much extra time getting last minute things in order like special treats or decorations. I feel like I don’t even really get to enjoy the celebrations when the parents come cause I’m just running around keeping things running smoothly. 

And then when I have to be firm with the kids who are going nuts I look ridiculous trying to be all serious in my costume! (Not really a problem but I do find it funny)

Up until recently I thought we were getting along great, until one of them called a meeting that apparently 3 of them were in on in which she sat on our coffee table and told us to shut up while she presented a PowerPoint. She proceeds to then chew us out for like 30 minutes. First, there was a picture of our used period products in the proper disposal bin because she saw one that may have fallen out of the wrapper. Gross and violating. Then she got upset about a paper towel that had been used when someone probably had a bloody nose or something was in the trash because how dare that person not bury it. Because digging through the trash is definitely less gross. Then she goes on to complain about how she and the two others that were there on the weekend deep cleaned everything (we weren't around to physically help). Keep in mind, the space was not kept gross, it was mildly cluttered like we agreed was ok early in the year. And if they had an issue, it could have been a civil discussion instead of this childish PowerPoint. Then she made a slide about how if you aren't hygienic then ""we're the ones who have to deal with you"" and another about ""what flew at home doesn't fly here"". She is not anyone's mother. Also, if someone suddenly stops taking care of themselves, I personally would be concerned about them. They could be depressed or something else could be happening. One of the slides also included her simping for Art the Clown and that was just odd to include in there. Ever since that power point I've noticed them getting into groups and whispering about each other and it feels so high school. Then the PowerPoint girl brings in some guys I've never met and just tell them ""We have this chore chart because some people don't know how to clean"" which is so weird. Another one also made a really odd text message that was basically a tutorial for washing your hair. Apparently it was targeted at a specific person, and I don't understand why you wouldn't ask them how they're doing if they aren't taking care of themselves. Idk if I'm reading too far into this but it's really left a bad taste in my mouth. I don't feel comfortable in the suite anymore because it feels like I'm under constant surveillance. But I don't want to cause unnecessary conflict. AITA? Does anyone have any advice on how to go about addressing this? (I've also gotten confirmation the hygiene comments were not about me but I'm still uncomfortable.)",1,1730406444.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False

1ggo5sx,https://i.redd.it/pw7nujwbi5yd1.jpeg,M26 with newly detected hypertension ,"Hi guys, just found this subreddit and wanted to share my side. Couple weeks ago my doctor cousin measured my pressure just because, i got 190/110… she reminded me a few years ago we did the same and i got 160 and ignored it at the moment. 

From that, my family, mostly her, basically gave me a intervention. On that i need to better my life habits, food, activity, the following that may come with this all, we have hypertension in our family, but she told me it was really worrying at this age, later that week i went to a cardiologist and she emphasize more on that.

For context, im 192mts tall and over this last year i got a lot of weight, ive been like this for the last couple of years but this was the worst, i went from what i recall 90kg, that was already fat in my head, to 120kg… ive been doing homeoffice for the last 4 years now, and I used to be a cook, so i go deep into that, although again, this last year i was getting a lot of trash food, so me and my girlfriend of two years gained a lot of weight. Doctor said my heart was ok, she explained the issue was my habits, metabolic something.

I thought i never saw a symptom, for example that day i got 190 they asked me if i felt something but I didn’t, but today I realized that for a couple of months (lets say aprit to august) i got really bad headaches daily, but i thought it was the need of coffee or the HVAC at my house (southern hemisphere so it was cold).

This thing got me really stressed and sad, i feel like a child crying about not being able to use salt, the doctor prohibited it, and said i would get used to it but idk, all tastes bland, and i come from a depressive couple of months, I usually get a lot of happiness from cooking, even healthy food, but no salt was like a bullet for me hahaha, but ill do it, i know is for my good and will keep it that way as long as necessary. I’ve felt really bad from trowing tantrums at my gf that is just trying to help me. 

I’ll take a look at the subreddit, it looks interesting, i just wanted to share my story and talk a bit about it all, if you got any guidance on this im all ears!

I am so far behind and one class in particular is completely online which means there are no meetings on zoom or in person. I am completely failing that class and have given up. 

Getting started specially on the reading and keeping up with it is one of the reasons I never got caught up. And I do not want to mess up again because I feel like they’re going to think I am just lazy. I don’t know what to do but if anyone has any advice. I don’t know if the Disability office could help because they gave me accommodations but told me that I had to be responsible for keeping up with my work which is fair but I’m struggling.

Some side notes: 
- the other classes I’m behind but not too bad and because I can record them, I can go back and listen.

- I am the head of household and a caregiver and I’m in my very early 20’s.

- Because I don’t have proper meds, I sometimes rely on coffee and it really helps with focus however I can’t continue drinking it because I get really nauseous even if I eat. ",1,1730406190.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False

(҂°ロ°) Halloween: 80's Edition  ༼◕_◕༽
Tonight, let's take a trip to the radical 80's to witness the wonders of Halloween, back when strangers were danger and Rainbow Bright and Go-Bots ruled the night! Come with me, won't you?

Before we get started on this trip to yesteryear, we'd better make sure you look the part. Most unfortunately, we couldn't find an actual 80's child's costume in an adult size. But don't worry! It won't be hard to approximate one. 

We begin, with the cheapest sweatpants and sweatshirt from Goodwill. Layer over that, a large plastic yard trashbag, which we shall fashion into a rather fetching pantsuit. Don't worry if it doesn't look like anything, no one's going to see it anyway. If you really must have a character, just draw their face right on your chest for some reason. Put on a giant puffer coat. Get a plastic plate. Cut out eyeholes, a negligently small nose hole and a tiny slit where your mouth goes just to make sure you can breath or talk at all. Attach this to your face using the snagging-est hair tie ever made. Now, moon boots lined with Nerf foam for your feet, just the thinnest cloth mittens you've ever seen, and maybe some ear muffs and/or a hat. 

Got all that? Good. Now, let's spend a chunk of the night fumbling around dark neighborhoods unable to really see. Feel your breath and, yes, snot start to condense on your plastic mask, making it that much harder to breath—until it finally freezes and you realize you're breathing out your eye holes (bonus points if you wear glasses).

Alright, enough of that! It's time to visit family. What are you doing?? No. The costume stays on. Yes, for the entire trip! Oh. Looks like Dad's not enjoying himself. Just... try not to make any noise. Maybe eat some more candy.

Great, we're here. Just listen to the old aunt's ooh and aww at your ""Trick or Treeeeeat!!"" You must be extra adorable tonight. Of course no one knows who you’re supposed to be, Coatboy! And, yep! Time for hugs. Yeeeah... That was definitely Aunt Doris' boob against your face. Just be glad Dad made you keep the mask on and try not to think about it until the inevitable therapy sessions.

Now go sit your plastic butt on the plastic cover on the velvet couch. Comfortable? Good! The possibility of scooting will not be making an appearance on this doubly protected upholstery tonight!

What? Sorry? Oh. Thank GOD! The aunts want to ""see your smiling face!"" 

Let's just get that mask... Oh. Hold on. You're a mess! Nothing Aunt spit on a wadded up kleenex pulled from her sleeve for some reason can't fix!

And there. You. Are! NOW, let's see that smiling face!

Good. The aunties are pleased. Go ahead and put that mask down and, whoa! That's nasty. It really all just POOLS in there, doesn't it.

You know what? It's fine! Why don't you try some ribbon candy. It's in that glass candy dish between the half dozen Crystal swan figurines on the glass coffee table. Wow. You really could break this entire living room in ten minutes' time if you had a mind to.

Whew! Is it hot in here? 

Let's see if you can make out the thermostat. Oh, it's only... also in the 80's? Now you see why you're in sweats—and why they call them that! Something's gotta catch all your prepubescent boy drippings before they funnel out your every plastic orifice!

It's okay. Dad's standing up. Go on and stumble down the stairs. Oops! Forgot your mask. Dad looks unhappy. Better run back up the... Ow! ...and back down. Wait! Don't forget your bag of old dirty coins and loosely wrapped Hershey's kisses!

At least it's cool outside... Cold... So COLD! Cold and WET! Maybe if you put your mask on. Oh! THAT'S wet! Wet and STICKY!

Good thing there's only 5 houses left to visit. Better fuel up on candy.

And there you go! You made it through the entire night. Not only did you only puke twice, you managed to survive the elements with only minor frostbite. This was a good Halloween!

-easy sea jelly! Fishing at the beach farm gives mostly shells, seaweed, and sea jelly which makes getting fish smokers much easier.

-very early crab pot bundle/ field research bundle. The crab pots bring in at least 225ish gold a day and with the free recycling machine you can get free iron, cloth, coal, wood, refined quarts, etc. It made me like an extra 5k in my first spring and was easy loved gifts for elliot.

-free coffee, bombs and burgers. While you dont get a ton of them, they're really useful for getting through the mines quickly and help with skull cavern in the early days.

-forage. Not just beach forage, seasonal forage in the grass areas. Perfect for early tea saplings. Also tons of exp! Foraging always takes ages to max out so the extra exp really makes a huge difference and can get you mastery quicker.

-so much hardwood! Which also gives tons of foraging exp

-the map is huge and pretty. Sand might not support sprinklers but its so much nicer to look at than the mud on the other farms.

-no weird layout! Im coming for whoever made the meadowland so awkward! Those random patches that ruin my perfect layout, i truly hate it!

TLDR: while you cant do mega crops until you get the deluxe retaining soil/ginger island farm, it amazing for literally everything else. Good money options, exp, size, looks pretty.",1,1730405845.0,StardewValley,2,1.0,False

My question is, what do you change when approaching such a delicate coffee? How do I get the most of those floral and tea like characteristics? Do you lower your temperature to keep the volatile compounds in the cup or is my thought here wrong and should I go for a higher temp to boost extraction?
I usually brew fairly light coffees but I expect this to behave differently from the usual things I drink.
