1g7vaf5,https://www.reddit.com/r/MotoUK/comments/1g7vaf5/rospa_3_year_retest_report/,RoSPA 3 year retest report,"I had my 3 year RoSPA retest on Friday. After a cold and foggy ride up to the meet point the weather soon improved and by the end it was warm sunshine.

The examiner was one I've net before, although previously it was for my car test rather than bike. He's a retired traffic officer and knows this area well while taking tests for both IAM but mainly RoSPA. He said a lot of his work is testing blood bikers who have to keep their qualifications up to date.

We met at Countess Services in Amesbury as it's convenient for both of us and after chatting about life in general, my bike and where we'd be going we headed off.

Initially we were straight out onto the A303 but only for a mile or so before turning left towards Bulford Camp. As you come down towards the village it's a fairly steep downhill and as I crossed into the 30 limit I was a bit fast, despite braking quite heavily to reduce speed. I should have anticipated the speed change from further out and have made sure to be doing exactly 30 mph as I crossed from the national speed limit road to the reduced section.

From there the road heads out towards Tidworth and although it was 10am there was very little in the way of other traffic so nothing of note happened along here. As I entered Tidworth I made sure to be at exactly the right speed - I didn't want to keep making the same error.

In Tidworth itself I took a wrong turn and we ended up in the town rather than leaving south on the A338. My fault but it's not a navigation test and we were eoon back on track heading out towards the A303 underpass. I know this road well so was able to ride it with confidence although always mindful of course that ""knowing a road"" does not allow you to see round corners or to spot where grip levels might have changed. 

Once through the S bends we caught up with a van doing 50 in the 60. A test is very much a demonstration of what you can do so I knew I'd need to at least demonstrate a safe overtake even if I couldn't complete it due to other traffic. In the event though it went perfectly. First close the following distance, then move sideways into the oncoming lane, then check the view ahead and get past safely if it's clear. Finally don't cut in too soon and make sure you return to 60 mph (if you have gone over it) as quickly as possible. The examiner shouldn't be checking their speedometer through an overtake but you do have to be sensible, especially on a faster bike.

As we passed through Porton I noticed another rider was now behind the examiner. This was a new concern as I didn't know how they would react to us riding to the speed limits. If they decided to ""make progress"" and overtake one or both of us then I would need to be fully aware. However thankfully they held back and at the next roundabout they turned left and we went straight on towards Salisbury.

This road leads through Old Sarum and then eventually onto the A345 to take us into Salisbury. By now there was more traffic around so it becomes more of a consideration when riding. The only thing of note on this stretch was that I was waiting at a red light to enter a junction when I realised that there was an emergency ambulance coming towards us. Due to the traffic flow on their side I could see that they would want to move out into my lane to get past the traffic and through the lights. I therefore waited when the lights turned green, holding my position to give the ambulance the space to complete their manoeuvre which was rewarded with a thank you wave from the driver. Hopefully it aided their progress towards whoever needed them just a little quicker!

Then we were into Salisbury city centre as the examiner had said he wanted to see my city riding skills. Thankfully there were not too many pedestrians around although you have to be switched on and assume people will be there. There was a brief opportunity to filter at one point which I took, again to demonstrate I could do it, although usual conditions I'd probably have held back as I'm not normally in much of a rush when riding. The examiner hadn't followed me so I slowed until he'd caught up again as there's no point in losing him completely!

We then left the city to head up the hill to a nearby garage which was the end point. It was a good point to stop before I headed off to work and he went on with his day. I bought him a coffee while he wrote up his notes and then we had a chat about the ride. I firmly believe that while the examiner will have a grade in mind already at this point it's perfectly possible to talk yourself into a different one if you  couldn't explain why you'd done certain things or what your thought processes had been. So it's an important part of the process as a whole.

RoSPA is graded into bronze, silver and gold and during my last test 3 years ago it had been silver. I really didn't know what his thoughts were - I'm quite hard on myself and some silly mistakes in the ride were playing heavily on my mind. It hadn't been a shocker but I was sure I could have done much better. I was absolutely amazed and very pleased though to find that I'd been awarded gold and that it's not so much that I'd made mistakes (we all do) but that they hadn't upset me or caused me to lose focus, plus I could explain my thoughts and actions throughout the ride.

I will in due course receive a full test report and a certificate to hang on the wall and then the hardest thing is maintaining those standards for the next three years!",2,1729418301.0,MotoUK,0,1.0,False

I cannot, for the life of me remember where I heard/saw this. I remember I fell asleep listening to stories and waking up to this specific story. Not sure if it's hidden in a complilation of scary stories or not though :/
What I remember: 


Someone was working a closing shift when a coworker was sick(?), said they were in the mountains, middle of nowhere type of deal. They spotted a deer that was near their car, it chased after them after stepping out to look closer. They locked one of the doors behind them and the deer thing started to lick the windows across the shop, trying to get in. I vividly remember there was a race to the secondary door that was unlocked. It somehow got in and chased them around the shop? The next thing I do remember is they ran out onto the road where they were found by a guy in a truck that they waved down?

Does it depend on what kind of party, how long you've been together, how much you trust them , etc. just your personal opinion and experiences?
 
And now thoughts on this situation: for context my partner and I have been together for almost 2 years. My biggest internal conflict atm is that I feel like I have made it very clear what my boundaries are and I don't feel they are being respected. They didn't usually go to parties in the beginning because ""they didn't want to"" but now it seems most of the parties they are invited to , I am not. If they don't want to go they don't and if they do they usually go with their same sex friend. I told them I don't have to do everything with them, I understand them wanting to have their own life, and after a little spat of me being uncomfortable with them going on a coffee date with someone of the opposite sex , with someone they hadn't known long, I did question whether it was my trauma and insecurities making me feel this way as opposed to how they have made me feel. I decided I did have to give them more trust to believe they would not knowingly put themselves in a situation where they would be questioned or felt there were was something more going on, I did not have to go to every outing; ie drinks after work, work friends get together, girls/guys night was obviously not a partner thing, etc. but that if they were going to a big party where it was just a social gathering my feelings would be hurt , because, why wouldn't you want me there? I do invite them to every party I've been to but they have always said no. Now fast forward, we are in a tough spot in our relationship where it's kind of a make or break moment, which I won't get into. They said they didn't even want to go to this party but they might go with their friend they usually go with. I was not invited. I did make a passive aggressive remark because they knew how I felt and I had told them I was free , they said if I wasn't going to do anything then they would just stay home with me. I said it was obvious to me they wanted to go, just not with me, and they'd rather not go then feel they had to invite me which was met with a ""you Can come if you want."" The spat just made everything worse to where we said we needed space and a breakup came up. They said we should give it about a week and i said why, so you can just go the party? Even though I told them to just go. They said no, I'm not even going to the party. Now before the week was up, I accidentally turned off my location for a few hours and when I realized I turned it off i turned it back on immediately and though we weren't talking I contacted them saying I'm so sorry I didn't realize it was off, I didn't want you to think anything bad and wanted to explain , they had also turned off their location at this point. They kept saying it wasn't a big deal. I said it was a big deal to me and made it seem like the breakup we had talked about was final. They kept saying ok or how much it wasn't a big deal and how we hadn't alwaaays shared our location. I asked them if they were going to the party and they said yes, with the same friend they usually go with. I said they said they weren't and they said they were talking about a different party we were going to go to (which I feel is bs because that party was in 2 weeks , not the one week we weren't going to talk) I ended the conversation there before I said things i was going to regret. I haven't really spoken to them since aside from telling them I feel like I wasn't respected and haven't been when it comes to me voicing what I am and am not comfortable with. My boundaries are usually met with an ""ok"" and no compromises or willingness to have been made. I'm usually the one meeting them half way or having to adjust. I told them I really had to reevaluate everything because things where I once felt I was just trying to grow as a person and be in a healthier relationship with them I now see as them just constantly pushing to get their way and not wanting to take me into consideration when I don't respond to things that make them uncomfortable that way, I again am the one to meet them halfway. I'm really struggling because I usually trust my gut and while I did feel I could trust them this whole situation put a sour taste in my mouth and made me for the first time feel doubt. They said they did end up feeling bad about it at the party and tried to turn it back on but because I wasn't on their ""friends list"" they couldn't figure it out (which I also feel is bs because you just turned it off a day ago, how did you forget) and that if that's how ""I wanted to feel about it"" then they understood but that wasn't their intention. I told them if they cared they would have responded with more than an ""ok"" and the way they handled it changed everything. We both ended it there for now and still intend to talk when we had originally planned but honestly - I'm pissed. For more context the friend they usually go with and I get along great, they have been invited to my parties. And when I originally asked my partner why they don't want me to go to parties they said they didn't want to feel basically like they had to entertain me(not their words but you get the point) , I said but they usually leave me alone at parties lol, I make my way and make friends and have never said or done anything that made them feel I was bored, annoyed or jealous.

Things have been good, and whenever there were any issues, he would be very open to discussing them and improving on them. In fact on that day itself we went for coffee and spent a good time.
And then suddenly things spiraled into the need for him to put more efforts into this since we said previously that we are more in the serious phase now, especially with my involvement with his family.
I wanted things to work out, but he decided its better we break up because he doesn‚Äôt want to be a hurdle to someone who could actually provide me that. What i wanted from that conversation was pinpoint exactly what kind of effort i needed to feel loved.
But he is so sure of his decision even if he himself told me he isnt sure it is the right decision.
I told him we should calm down and discuss later and we did yesterday. I told him about the things we could do and that i hoped he changed his decision, but he is so adamant. I asked him if he wanted to breakup before that conversation, and he said no. I also asked him if he loved me any less, he said no.
Then he completely switched. Like he said he‚Äôd like to be a friend and there was some food festival going on near my house, he mentioned how if its okay with me we could have gone there today. I, ofc, denied.
 He texted me last night with a picture of alcohol joking that he is in his drunkard era and then talked about football.
I just dont understand this. Ive spent yesterday processing my emotion, talking about the hurt with my people and its still not ok. I know he is pretending to be okay, but the fact that he wants to continue texting normally and meeting regularly is not sitting well with me.
Im having issues comprehend the break up because it is not making sense to me.

Context: he has a lot of repressed emotions, low self esteem and a lot of unresolved guilt stemming from his familial situation. Last week was rather tough on his because of his family but im having difficulty understanding how could he sabotage us like that.",1,1729416861.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

the jealousy isn‚Äôt necessarily bc of my (19f) bf (21m) but i just get jealous when i see people able to be with their significant others and go on dates while my bf is a 10+ hour flight away from me. 

specifically, one of my coworkers always talks to me abt her love life bc she‚Äôs recently single and she‚Äôs on dating apps, so she‚Äôd update me on guys she‚Äôd have sex with, guys she makes out with, receives hickeys, flowers, will go out of their way to get her coffee. idc abt the personal details, something i told her straight up and i rlly don‚Äôt care, but it‚Äôs just a little frustrating to me that i can‚Äôt have those same things with my bf that i‚Äôve been dating for a couple of months now (we haven‚Äôt met yet) 

this also just adds on to the fact that i‚Äôve just generally been feeling a little lonely in my relationship. me and my bf still text pretty frequently, we still have lively conversations and gems still very lovey and cutesy, but lately we haven‚Äôt been calling.

for context:my bf joined the military during our relationship but only stayed for a month and got medically discharged for mental health reasons. it‚Äôs been almost a month since he got back and we‚Äôve only called twice since then and before he left, we called and slept on ft pretty frequently. 

he has expressed to me that readjusting after the military‚Äôs been tough on him, i offer to give him space but he does say that having me around helps him. we have a 6 hour time difference and his sleep. schedule has changed in that he‚Äôs been conditioned to sleeping/waking up early due to the military, whereas before he had no problem staying up til 2-5 in the morning calling me and waking up later. 

i rlly have been trying not to be pushy abt this, i don‚Äôt like complaining and nagging at ppl, but the few times i do ask if it‚Äôs okay to call, he always says he‚Äôs tired or just doesn‚Äôt feel like it. it makes me really sad, even though we text a lot, long distance is harder when you can‚Äôt talk or see your partner in real time and it just makes me feel rlly lonely and a lil sad. 

i have expressed this to him, he‚Äôs reassured me that he does still love me and it‚Äôs just things he‚Äôs going through mentally. but even when he knows that i‚Äôve been wanting to call, he never takes the chance to ask me first or initiate calling. it‚Äôs always me that has to (try) ask him.

i don‚Äôt rlly expect anyone to read this or care enough to comment, i just rlly needed to write and vent out some of my feelings. i love my bf very much, ik he loves me, i just wish long distance wouldn‚Äôt be so hard sometimes ",3,1729416261.0,LongDistance,0,1.0,False

Despite the miles separating them, Jenna Thompson and Emma Carter were bound by a common desire for change and a quest for a healthier lifestyle.

**A New Chapter Begins in Seattle**

Jenna Thompson, a 38-year-old graphic designer, was constantly juggling her busy career and the demands of parenting her energetic seven-year-old son, Noah. Life in Seattle was often chaotic, and the weight around her midsection felt like an anchor holding her back from truly enjoying it. As she scrolled through social media, watching friends share their fitness victories, Jenna couldn‚Äôt help but feel a pang of envy. Each post served as a reminder of her own struggles with failed diets and workout plans.

One rainy Saturday morning, as she savored her usual cup of coffee, Jenna stumbled upon an intriguing blog post titled ‚ÄúJava Burn Coffee ‚Äî A Game-Changer or Just Hype?‚Äù Her curiosity piqued, she delved into the details. The article described Java Burn Coffee, a weight-loss supplement that effortlessly blended into her morning coffee, boasting a blend of natural ingredients like chlorogenic acid and green tea extract. It promised to enhance metabolism and aid weight loss without the dreaded side effects of traditional weight-loss pills. Encouraged by the 60-day money-back guarantee, Jenna decided it was time to take a leap of faith.

**The Taste of Transformation**

Meanwhile, in Chicago, Emma Carter, a marketing executive in her late thirties, faced her own set of challenges. The long hours at work left her little time to prioritize her health, and the stubborn weight clinging to her midsection felt like a relentless foe. One fateful evening, while scrolling through a health blog, Emma stumbled upon the same Java Burn Coffee post that had caught Jenna's attention. The prospect of easily incorporating a supplement into her morning routine resonated with her desire for change.

With a mix of excitement and skepticism, Emma ordered Java Burn Coffee. Within days, she was stirring the powder into her morning coffee, finding comfort in its unchanged flavor. Almost immediately, subtle changes began to surface. Her energy levels surged, cravings diminished, and she felt lighter both physically and mentally.

**Finding Support in Sisterhood**

As fate would have it, Jenna and Emma‚Äôs paths would soon cross, igniting a beautiful friendship. During a coffee catch-up with her friend Lisa, Jenna shared her Java Burn Coffee success story. Inspired by Jenna‚Äôs progress, Lisa decided to join her on the journey. Emma, too, was buoyed by the encouragement of her friend Sarah, who was wrestling with similar weight challenges.

As weeks turned into months, the support from their friends became vital in their respective journeys. Jenna lost 25 pounds, becoming more engaged with her family. She initiated outdoor activities with Noah and discovered a newfound love for cooking healthy meals, encouraging her son to try new foods. Meanwhile, Emma shed ten pounds, feeling empowered and revitalized, ready to tackle life head-on with the energy that Java Burn Coffee provided.

**A Celebration of Change**

Despite their progress, both women faced moments of doubt. Jenna struggled when the scale didn't budge as quickly as she hoped, while Emma encountered similar frustrations. Yet through laughter, tears, and unwavering support, their friendship flourished. Their morning coffee rituals transformed into cherished moments where they celebrated small victories and reminded each other that health was about progress, not perfection.

Eventually, Jenna and Emma decided to organize a gathering to celebrate their transformations. Surrounded by supportive friends and family, they shared their inspiring stories, emphasizing the importance of community and simple solutions that fit into daily life. Their journeys weren‚Äôt just about losing weight; they became a testament to empowerment and the strength found in sisterhood.

**A Final Reflection**

Today, Jenna and Emma continue to thrive, living healthier and more fulfilling lives. They‚Äôve embraced their journeys, understanding that transformation is a marathon, not a sprint. The laughter and support shared over countless cups of coffee have left a lasting impact, reminding them that every small step counts.

In a world filled with quick fixes and fleeting diets, Jenna and Emma's stories serve as a beacon of hope for anyone struggling with their weight. With determination and the right tools, like Java Burn Coffee, anyone can achieve their health goals‚Äîone cup of coffee at a time. So, if you find yourself standing at the edge of your own journey, take a leap of faith; you never know what beautiful transformations await. **Start your transformation today with Java Burn, which will make a difference in your way of life.**¬†[https://javaburn.com/](https://freezegluco.com/Javaburn.html)",1,1729415889.0,healthysupplement_,0,1.0,False

I (31, male, let's say my name is Bob) have recently started my new job. It took me 3 weeks to meet the first weirdo.

She is a 31 yo woman, who absolutely lacks any sort of control over what she says or does. 

When we first met, she was super anxious about having to go to a meeting with her boss. Like nealy fainting levles of nervous. So obviously, I started to comfort her. I told her that she has absolutely nothing to worry about. A) I'm sure she has done a good job. B) Even in the off chance that she made a mistake or two, she is also relatively new here, so I'm sure it's gonna be fine, as people don't give newbies tasks with a life-or-death level of importance. C) Whatever happens in the workplace has no meaning on one's value as a person. 

This made her visibly ease up.

After she came back from the meeting, she asked me to grab a coffee with her in the break room. Apparently, the meeting went well. Then she started talking about how toxic her boss is, and how toxic every single one of her previous workplaces were. She asked me about my experiences, and I told her that my previous workplace was pretty nice, and I liked working there, although there were some serious misunderstandings in the end, which made me quit.

At this point she spotted one of our coworkers, and started screaming from the top of her lungs: ""Hey, Joe, come here, we are Gossiping about how both of us had only had toxic workplaces before!""

I was shocked, and corrected her on the spot that this is not at all what I said. Still, she put me in a very uncomfortable situation.

Later on we had lunch with my collegaues, where she kept bitching about how toxic her current boss is. (She works in a different team.) This was already uncomfortable to listen to, but then she continued saying: Yeah, Bob was so nice to me this morning, he told me not to worry about my job, because neither of us are the CEO of the company, so it doesn't really matter if we mess up. 

Again, I was shocked, and I corrected her on the spot. Still, it was a very uncomfortable situation.

Couple of weeks later she walks in  the office one morning and tells me that we have a common friend. Apparently it's my ex girlfriend whom I broke up with a couple of moths ago. Great... She kept talking about it for weeks until one of my colleagues intervened and shot her down, as she wouldn't listen when I told her that I would like to let the whole story go. (I was at fault here too, because at first I was interested, so my mistake there, lesson learned.)

There were still other wierd things, but I gotta get off the train now. What do you think?

So the most annoying thing might be the 1/10 coffee which did shine actually when I used the 4:6 kasuya method. So it has to be working right? Besides that I was a broken man. I got everything but the success. But I got suspicious how nothing changed drastically with temp, pour, recipe, water, filters, brewer, coffee and whatnot.

I‚Äôve been making my own cold brew for a year or 2 and am still dialing it in to get the best results. Would love to hear what you think of my method and general recipe. The following is what I would do for 1 serving:

- 36g beans total (2x normal brewing serve). Of that, I will usually do 4-6g espresso roast and the rest filter roast, both single origin. I find that 100% filter roast brews is very tea-like and lacks the roasted backbone that I like, hence a sprinkle of espresso roast.

- medium-coarse grind. I have one of those $100 bodum grinders, I put it about 1.5 notches above the midpoint (pour over icon), which is closer to pour over than French press

- ~325g water. Slightly more than double for 2 servings.

- all in the French press, pop it in the fridge with foil over the top for 12-15 hours and plunge!. Still figuring out optimal brewing time. Right now, it‚Äôs however long until I wake up and am too excited to wait longer. I find that anything longer than 16 hours can only hurt. 

- Bonus: where I am in Melbourne, AUS, we have a roaster who does a Nicaragua filter roast decaf (Swiss water), the best decaf I‚Äôve ever had. So if I feel like a tasty treat but don‚Äôt want to get kicked out of places for acting psychotic while running my weekend errands, I‚Äôll sub in the decaf for regular filter roast. 

Now roast me if you will. Cheers!

Apologies if bit of a personal question, but when on the carnivore diet should you be going daily or is it less frequently than if you were eating all normal meat,plant, processed crap?

I'm exactly one week in and had one in 7 days.
I'm strictly on meat, eggs, butter and some tasty cheese, salt/pepper and garlic powder, not eating anything else.

Usually 300 - 400gms of ground mince and 3 eggs for lunch,
Then a 300ish gram streak for dinner and 3 eggs, 4 slices of block tasty cheese.

Current weight was 108.5kg and now down to 105.4kg.

I fast after diner for roughly 17 hours besides a morning black coffee.

Water is usually around 3 - 4lts a day, and 1 - 2 cups organic bone broth.

History seems to sleep here. What drew me was the name‚ÄîTranquebar. I‚Äôm the kind of person who travels without much prior research, just going with the flow, and that‚Äôs how I ended up here. I took a bus from Pondicherry to Karaikal and got down at Tharagambadi‚ÄîTranquebar‚Äôs old name during colonial times.

I‚Äôm still learning about the history here, so I won‚Äôt comment too much on it yet. Coming from Pondicherry, maybe my expectations were a bit high‚Äîit‚Äôs nothing like the French colony. Tranquebar is just remnants of what was once a strong trade center. This place holds significant historical value, but it‚Äôs poorly maintained, perhaps due to the tsunami that hit here. It would‚Äôve been great if a township like Pondicherry existed here, blending both foreign and Indian culture.

The main attraction is the Danish fort. It‚Äôs a great spot to learn about the area and take pictures. They have some interesting artifacts on display, including whale bones. Like most forts in India, this one hasn‚Äôt escaped the naivety of young couples scribbling their names‚Äîplease don‚Äôt do it, and if you see someone, kindly ask them to stop. These sites have stood for hundreds of years; they deserve to remain untouched.

The fort overlooks the sea, offering a breathtaking view in the evenings. There‚Äôs a small temple near the beach, a short walk from the fort. I didn‚Äôt catch the name, but if anyone reading this knows, please add it in the comments. There are churches here too, including the first Protestant church in Asia, and Zion Church, both likely dating back to the 1700s.

If you‚Äôre interested in learning more about the history of Tranquebar, I‚Äôd recommend the Maritime Museum just outside the fort. They have a small collection of books on Tranquebar and Indian history. They also serve tea and coffee. In fact, I‚Äôm writing this while sipping tea here‚Äîit's great!

I introduced myself (M29) to her and we added each other on social media. At the time she was just in town visiting friends and family, but she told me she would be moving there. We messaged each other for months before she moved back. We always talked about hanging out or getting coffee, but we never did.

The only time I get to see her is at that bar, because she goes like every weekend. She'll hug me and say ‚ÄúI miss you, I care about you, and sorry for not responding to your messages.‚Äù I get to talk to her for maybe five to ten minutes and then she'll say ‚ÄúI need to go to the bathroom and I will be right back,‚Äù but then she'll go talk to some other guys for like thirty minutes before she come back to me.

When she was drinking she started telling me that she feels like I'm too good for her and that I deserve better. In her past she has some felonies and she's sold drugs to people, but she says she doesn't anymore. She told me that she knows I'm a Christian and she feels like she would be dragging me down. She also says that she didn't have a good experience with church growing up and so she said it has made her somewhat distant to me sometimes. This is all stuff she said when she was drinking though.

I tried to tell her that she's I'm important to me and that I want her on my life, but she just says I'm a terrible person and I've made a lot of mistakes. When she's drinking she‚Äôll kiss on me and put her arms around me and get all close, but when she's sober she mostly just talks to me for a few minutes and then comes up with a reason to leave and go talk to other guys. I don't know what to think about all this.

I'm ok with her talking to other guys. Were not even in a relationship, but it just makes me wonder how much she actually values me when she‚Äôll leave mid conversation to ‚Äúgo to the bathroom‚Äù and then just go hug on and talk to all these different guys.

1g7tyox,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1g7tyox/whisper_in_the_bloodline/,Whisper in the Bloodline,"On my twenty-fifth birthday, my dad told me about a unique family tradition passed down all the way from the 17th century.

‚ÄúOur family has a book that's been passed down many generations,‚Äù he began.

‚ÄúThe first entry was written by your twelfth great-grandfather Edward in 1655. When Edward was thirty years old, he hand-wrote a long, detailed book of wisdom and life learnings for his eldest son, your eleventh great-grandfather William, and gave it to him to read at the age of twenty-five. After William finished reading, Edward then instructed William to write his own life learnings in the next pages before he turned thirty, then hand it down to his oldest son when he turned twenty-five with the same instructions. William‚Äôs oldest son Harold, your tenth great grandfather, did the same.‚Äù

I listened in awe.

‚ÄúOver time the collective wisdom of the books from each first-born sons of our ancestors were passed down through the generations,‚Äù He continued. ‚ÄúWhen the book was damaged during the Napoleonic war, your sixth great grandfather diligently restored the book to the best of his ability. By the time of the first world war, the pages were so worn that your great-great grandfather recreated it with a typewriter before passing the new copy down. When your grandfather passed it to me, that copy was falling apart, so I copied it into a Google Doc.‚Äù

He paused. *Comically tech savvy, but efficient*, I thought.

‚ÄúNow that you‚Äôve turned twenty-five, I‚Äôll be sending it to you.‚Äù

‚ÄúWow, that‚Äôs mind blowing!‚Äù I exclaimed, ‚ÄúWhat other family has something like that?‚Äù

‚ÄúRight? No family like us.‚Äù He smiled and patted me on the back, as he sent me an email from his laptop. ‚ÄúRead it carefully. It contains the wonderful experiences and wisdom from the youths of our past grandfathers. To carry on the tradition, you‚Äôve got five years to write your own message to pass onto your oldest son, along with the rest of them. Might as well start thinking about it early.‚Äù

‚ÄúWait, I can‚Äôt write stuff in it after I turn thirty?‚Äù

‚ÄúAfraid not,‚Äù dad shook his head, ‚ÄúNot sure why, that‚Äôs how the tradition goes. Each entry is an account of youth, written between the ages of twenty-five to thirty. We must respect it.‚Äù

‚ÄúFair enough.‚Äù

I opened the email with the link to the Google doc that dad had transcribed, containing thirteen generations of wisdom. The entries were fascinating and emotional. That night, I stayed up until dawn reading.

Edward, my twelfth great-grandfather who started our book, was a wealthy estate owner who lived through the English Civil War. I was impressed by his writing, even though I had to try and decipher some of the old English.

To quote, ‚Äú*I commence this tome to chronicle the youths of mine sons. As long as they draw breath, I shall not meet my end.*‚Äù

I was sure my future grandsons would be disappointed at my entry after reading a banger like that.

His eldest son William, my eleventh great-grandfather, was similarly a hard-working tradesman. One of his gems of wisdom: ""*A man‚Äôs worth is not measured by his fortune, but by his steadfastness when the world shifts beneath his feet.*""

His son Harold, a soldier who fought during the War of Spanish Succession, seemed like the total opposite type to his dad and grandad. ‚Äú*My dear son and grandsons, to charm a lady and shoot a pistol are but two arts of precision; both require a steady hand and a heart unflinching. For while bullets may fly true, it is the spark in her eye that captures a man's soul.*‚Äù

*He must‚Äôve gotten all the ladies,* I thought. Unfortunately, it seems like I never inherited any of those pickup genes.

Each entry was as captivating as the last. It was as if I could envision the spirited youths of my grandfathers standing in front of me, speaking to me directly. In their stories, I discerned reflections of my own character and glimpses of their shared essence within one another. It was an emotional experience ‚Äì they were all well written and captured the highest highs and lowest lows of their lives.

Well, all except for *one*. I was left confused by my fourth great-grandfather‚Äôs entry.

All my other grandfathers, my dad included, had written dozens of pages, full of stories, teachings and advice. But my fourth great-grandfather had only written one page. I couldn‚Äôt even understand the meaning of his entry.

‚Äú*He is the whisper that directs you to verity. Is it sagacity or artifice that you discern in his utterances? Not all connections possess the strength they purport, nor the sincerity. Your heart perceives more than your eyes are willing to acknowledge. Father-hood is a role most sacred. When the stars align, fate weaves its intricate design. You are the author of your own unfolding tale, brave and unyielding. Turn your gaze to the horizon, where dreams dance on the edge of dawn. Thirty echoes with the laughter of youth, yet whispers of wisdom draw near. You must delve deeper, beyond the well-known fa√ßade. Are you prepared for what lies hidden beneath? Next arrives the instant when your destiny shall reveal.*‚Äù

Perhaps he was trying to write a poem, I thought. I asked dad, but he had no idea what it meant either. He suggested the war made my fourth grandfather go mad, and perhaps those were his ramblings.

For the next two years, I periodically opened up the Google Doc and read through the entries, while thinking of what I would write in my own. I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about my fourth great-grandfather‚Äôs entry. Like my dad, I concluded that it was most likely gibberish. Either he was trying to sound overly artistic, or he had really gone mad during the war. PTSD was no joke. However, my fifth great-grandad‚Äôs entry about his son, and my third great-grandfather‚Äôs entry about his father, my fourth great-grandfather, were both bothersome to me.

According to the context, my fifth great-grandfather finished his entry at the age of twenty nine, and had my fourth great-grandfather, his first son at the age of nineteen. He describes his oldest son:

‚Äú*As I observe my ten-year-old son, a quiet lad with a contemplative brow, I am continually astounded by the brilliance that resides within him. Though he speaks little, his mind dances with the complexities of numbers, effortlessly unraveling the most intricate mathematical conundrums that baffle even seasoned minds. His remarkable ability to discern subtleties in behavior and read the hearts of those around him fills me with confidence that he shall one day be a genius of great renown. I cannot help but envision a future where he is celebrated not merely for his intellect, but for the profound understanding he brings to the world‚Äîa light among many, illuminating paths previously obscured*.‚Äù

Basically, he clearly thought his son was exceptionally intelligent as a boy. Having read that description, I couldn‚Äôt help but think there was a deeper meaning to my fourth great-grandfather‚Äôs book entry, which seemed nonsensical at first glance.

My third great-grandfather describes how as a child, he witnessed his father, my fourth great-grandfather, trying to take his own life several times. A notable quote reads:

‚Äú*As an eight-year-old, the memory is etched into my mind like a scar that time cannot heal. I recall the day vividly, the sombre atmosphere hanging heavy in the air, as I witnessed my father, a man of strength and resolve, grappling with a darkness I could not comprehend. His actions, born of despair, unfurled before my young eyes like a cruel nightmare, shattering the innocence of my childhood in an instant. In that moment, I felt a chilling blend of fear and confusion, a child's heart struggling to understand how the very anchor of our family could be so lost, leaving an indelible mark on my soul that would forever shape my understanding of sorrow.*‚Äù

I deciphered from the rest of his entry that my fourth great-grandfather would have been about twenty-six at the time this happened.

After much consideration, I eventually came to the conclusion that the PTSD theory seemed to fit ‚Äì perhaps he was a highly intelligent man struggling mentally around the time he wrote his entry, so it made little sense. But I could never shake the feeling that my fourth great-grandfather was trying to convey something deeper.

For the past five years, I had taken extensive notes about my most important life experiences and was finally ready to gather them into prose to complete my chapter of the family book. I took a vacation from work to visit my parents at their house, and to complete my entry, something I had now considered was to be one of the most important events of my life.

Dad came downstairs to find me typing away on my MacBook in the morning.

‚ÄúHard at work leaving your legacy,‚Äù he beamed, as he sat on the couch with his morning coffee.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre gonna love this,‚Äù I smiled, eyes fixed on the screen. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs gotta be my oldest son I give this to, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs correct.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, what if I never have a son?‚Äù I asked nonchalantly. I wasn‚Äôt even married.

‚ÄúOh, you will.‚Äù He smiled.

I raised an eyebrow.

‚ÄúOkay... lot of confidence you‚Äôve got in me there.‚Äù

I took a break from typing to flick back up through the Google Doc for inspiration and found myself staring at my fourth great-grandfather‚Äôs entry again. I stared for a couple of minutes in deep thought, until the words were floating into each other across the screen.

My eyes started scanning the first word of each sentence.

‚ÄúHe Is Not Your Father When You Turn Thirty You Are Next‚Äù

I blinked.

I read the first word of each sentence again. Was that... a message?

After a minute, I realized it made some sort of sense as a message. I began to think about it. Was my fourth grandfather trying to convey the message to someone else who would receive the book after him? If he was, what was that message even getting at? Then it started to click.

My heart began to race as I looked at my dad, without turning my head. He sat still on the couch, watching the morning news. I looked back at the screen.

‚ÄúDad,‚Äù I said, my voice shaking slightly. He looked up at me.

‚ÄúYes?‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you remember when I was about six or seven, you and mom would read me a story in my room every night?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù he said, after a pause.

‚ÄúDo you remember *which* stories?‚Äù

He scratched his head.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt remember all those stories, that was a long time ago,‚Äù he said.

It was *Goodnight Moon*. I had asked them to read the same story to me every night for three years. There was no way he would forget that. I started shaking as the background noise of the television faded, replaced by the sound of my racing pulse filling my ears.

An unfathomable thought popped into my head. My mind pieced the jigsaw together into an unbelievable but logical conclusion.

‚ÄúEdward?‚Äù I said quietly, without hesitation. My mouth moved on its own.

Dad stared at me, a surprised look on his face. Our eyes met.

His surprise slowly faded, and was replaced by a wide grin. He stood up and suddenly moved in my direction, then crouched down beside me, staring up maniacally into my eyes as he smiled. I was terrified ‚Äì all I wanted to do was scream and run from this thing that was not my dad, but I was paralyzed.

‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt heard that name in four and a half centuries,‚Äù he whispered.

All I could do was stare, sweat dripping down my forehead.

‚ÄúYou see, I like to know a bit about my sons before I inhabit them,‚Äù he continued, in a hushed voice, ‚ÄúI look back at my book of the last words of my sons, and sometimes I feel sorry for them. How oblivious they were.‚Äù

‚ÄúW-what did you do to dad?‚Äù I cried.

‚ÄúWhen he turned thirty, I unlocked his body. Then I simply entered.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe fuck you mean you ‚Äòunlocked‚Äô‚Ä¶ what the actual fuck is going on?‚Äù My voice trembled.

‚ÄúI lived on through him, and I‚Äôll live on through you, too. When you turn thirty, I‚Äôll leave this body and inhabit yours. Don‚Äôt worry, it doesn‚Äôt hurt. You won‚Äôt even feel it. But you‚Äôll no longer be here, which is a shame, so I‚Äôd like to keep a little memoir of your existence. You‚Äôd better hurry ‚Äì wouldn‚Äôt want the rest of my sons reading an unfinished entry.‚Äù

My mind flashed back to a doctors‚Äô appointment I had as a child, which I attended with my mom. When the doctor asked if I had any family history of medical conditions, my mom mentioned that my grandad, my dad‚Äôs father, had died young at fifty-two, having collapsed from an unknown cause. The doctor advised my mom that I should get tested for a condition called hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, or HOCM, a condition that can cause sudden unexplained deaths in fit people. The test came out negative, which I was glad about at the time, now not so much.

Dad stood up, placed his empty coffee mug on the kitchen counter, and made his way upstairs. I turned to look at him, his mouth still stretched into a wide, toothy, demonic grin as he walked up the staircase.

I snapped out of my shellshocked paralysis and promptly left my parents‚Äô house, packing up as soon as dad was out of sight. My heart was in my mouth, and I couldn't catch my breath. Panic had taken over my entire body.

It‚Äôs been two weeks since the incident, and I‚Äôve been awake almost every night. While the terror hasn't subsided, I‚Äôve accepted my likely fate ‚Äì that my body will soon be possessed, and I know there isn‚Äôt much I can do about it.

Mom will be alone soon, so I‚Äôve spent some time making sure all my assets are assigned to her name. If my shrewd fourth grandfather wasn‚Äôt able to find a way out, I doubt I‚Äôll be able to in the two weeks I have before my thirtieth birthday.

But I‚Äôm hoping someone will.

It seems like he didn‚Äôt catch onto my fourth grandfather realizing his scheme. I‚Äôll write something generic for my entry, but I‚Äôll edit my third grandfather‚Äôs entry and hope he doesn‚Äôt notice.

‚Äú*I have perused the prior entries in this book, and while each brims with remarkable wisdom, none resonate with me quite like my father's. A man of exceptional intellect, as my grandfather noted, his powers of perception are unparalleled. At first glance, his entry may appear muddled or the ramblings of a troubled mind, but I implore you to read it with care; the truth lies hidden within. It is imperative that you grasp its meaning, for your very life may hinge upon it. Though we were unable to find a way out, we are compelled to issue this warning, hoping that one day, one among you might find the path to freedom. I love you dearly. Your life holds immense value, and I earnestly wish for you, out of all of us, to be the one who prevails when the time* *comes.*‚Äù
