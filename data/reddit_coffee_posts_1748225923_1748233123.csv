1kvlbnm,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1kvlbnm/aio_husband_told_me_is_apple_watch_was_broken/,AIO - Husband Told Me Is Apple Watch Was 'Broken',"So my husband (51M) and I (47F) have recently had some issues in our relationship related to trust. We have been together for nearly 20 years and have three teenage kids. We both have Apple watches and use Apple Family to keep an eye on our kids through the 'Find My' app. This is turn gives us visibility of each others location. 

Last year we had some issues related to him meeting up numerous times with a female work colleague (coffees on the beach, walking dogs together) on his 'work from home' days but not mentioning it to me, and then when I realised what was happening, lying to me about how long it had been going on. This has created a lot of tension in the house. I now have trust issues. He calls me controlling - as I am now more interested in where he is when he is out an about, and use sometimes use the 'Find My' application sometimes to check where he is. 

A few months ago he changed his Apple ID password. This created connection issues with his Apple Watch (and intermittent problems with location tracking) as he was reportedly not able to figure out how to relog the new password on his watch. While this seemed odd to me I did not push him to fix it as I did not want to seem controlling. 

My husband goes on a 5 night work trip in two days time. He announced yesterday that the watch is broken because of the log in issue and only the fitness apps now work - so he stopped charging it or wearing it - stating that he would only wear it in the future while he is doing fitness. His charger also disappeared from beside his bed. This seemed odd to me so I asked to see if I could try to fix the watch. He was angry and called me controlling again, but allowed me to look at it. I was able to relogin the watch after ten minutes. The watch was then working fine, and all the apps were then working perfectly. 

My husband was noticeably irritated when i fixed the watch. He did not charge it last night, and did not wear it to work today. 

In my opinion, as all the apps on the watch worked fine all along (except for the Find My app previously not working sometimes - but now working fine), I told him he lied about 'only the fitness app working' - and I thought it extremely fishy that he decided to stop wearing the watch a few days before the 5 night work function. For the record the previous work colleague he went for walks with is not going on the trip - so I am not worried about her in particular - but I do wonder if he is trying to hide something from me related to his location during the trip. 

He says I am delusional and I am trying to sabotage the relationship. Am I overreacting? ",2,1748232799.0,AmIOverreacting,0,1.0,False
1kvlbdc,https://www.reddit.com/r/SacredSpirithood/comments/1kvlbdc/measure_in_love_remembering_our_ancestors_one/,"Measure in Love: Remembering Our Ancestors, One Season at a Time","How do you measure a year?

If you're anything like me, someone who honors their dead and lives with one foot in the spiritual world, you know the answer isn't on a clock. It isn't in a planner. It sure isn‚Äôt in a spreadsheet.

We measure in love.  
In survival.  
In the quiet victories no one outside our bloodline ever knew we had to win.

""Five hundred, twenty five thousand, six hundred minutes."" That lyric always hits me like a bell rung in the bones. Not because it‚Äôs mathematical, but because it feels like counting rosary beads. Like honoring every second someone fought to stay alive. That‚Äôs the root of how I practice. That‚Äôs how I teach my clients to remember their people, not as legends, but as human beings who lived every one of those minutes.

Our ancestors weren‚Äôt perfect. Some were messy. Some were loud. Some stayed silent their whole lives because silence kept them alive. Some made mistakes. Some gave everything. And some just wanted peace. A place to rest.

But they carried on. And so do we.

In my work as a reader and spiritual counselor, I always come back to this. Not just what do you want from the spirits, but who walked before you and what did they leave for you to carry. Do you think your laugh came from nowhere? That your love of cinnamon coffee or your fear of loud voices wasn‚Äôt passed down like a story? Our ancestors gave us more than genetics. They gave us their seasons.

When the song says

""In truths that she learned  
Or in times that he cried  
In bridges he burned  
Or the way that she died""

I don‚Äôt hear tragedy. I hear history. I hear the voices of clients who say they feel stuck and don‚Äôt know why. Sometimes that stuckness isn‚Äôt yours. Sometimes what we carry is unfinished grief, unspoken joy, memories that never had a voice. And now they live in us, waiting to be remembered.

That‚Äôs what this work is. Not just spells for luck or love. Not just readings for curiosity. It's remembrance. It's repair. It's love.

Because in the end, when the name fades, when the house is gone, when the photo curls and yellows, we still remember one thing  
Did they love us  
Did we love them back

That‚Äôs why I light the candles. That‚Äôs why I whisper their names. That‚Äôs why I sit with you on Mondays and ask what you‚Äôre really trying to say to the ones who came before you.

Not everything is about healing. Some of it is just about honoring. Some of it is about witnessing.

Five hundred, twenty five thousand, six hundred minutes.

Measure your life the way they measured theirs  
In stubborn joy  
In fierce protection  
In truth  
In presence

And always in love.

What I am trying to do:

So I have created a coffees Type. I also added a Type called 'Coffee Process' that I will link to each of the various coffees we try.

Sometimes the process has multiple names and I'd like to be able to search by the alternate names. My idea was to create some type of 'aliases' property on the Process with a list of names. However, there isn't a list style property where I can specify multiple unique names. These are also not tags or multi-select or anything since each name is unique to the process. 
Whats the best way to specify alternate names? that allow me to quickly find them?

Joined the EV gang Saturday. 18 month old I5 ultimate with tech and tow packs. 

Although our son is on his 3rd EV ( VW, Vauxhall and now MG4 ) I have not ventured into the EV space. I am coming from 50 years of ICE ownership and a committed petrol head. Everything from Alfa Romeos to minis, fiat, BMW, jaguar blah blah. Currently have a V8 Mercedes SLK 55 AMG and an Audi SQ5 in the driveway. SLK sold awaiting collection. 

Why EV? Cost of fuel for a start, I have installed a charger at home and 2p a mile for 'fuel' is far more appealing than 14p! But mostly I am so over digging around in brake pad changes, general maintenance,  cam belts and chains and all the ICE stuff! The water pump fsilure on the Audi was the last straw! 

My requirements looking for an EV were tow capability minimum 1000 kg. Range, as much as possible, space for my gliding crap. ( a good bootful ) suv style, ( makes loading and unloading said crap easier ). Add to that dealer availability and reputation.

Came down to a Txxxx, Polestar 3 or a Hyundai. Looked at BYD, VW, and a few others.

The Model Y was a strong contender as was the Polestar 3, Polestar lost out on price, just too much. The MY lost out on .... well, I just cant be dealing with the lock in to the whole experience and they are dated and no longer the leader. 

My wife has an 11 year old Hyundai i10, never given a moments trouble, been great for her. Still going strong so that started to swing it.

V2L - great for working on glider on an airfield. Power tools like a polisher, soldering iron, standard glider batteries etc. Also very cool for lighting or a hob when camping on excursions or a hot coffee on winter flying days!

Looked at a few I5's ( never had a test drive! ) went out to look at this one and ........ bought it on the spot!

48 hours in and two trips to the gliding club and I am really blown away by the car. What a brilliant piece of kit!

( I do have some issues and may actually have to swap the car! But it will be an identical one the vehicle is exactly what I wanted! )

She woke up early, drank her coffee, and went for a short jog before work. Everything felt the same, until noon.

That‚Äôs when she felt a sudden, sharp pain in her stomach.

It was so strong she had to grab the edge of her desk to stay upright. Her coworkers barely noticed as she rushed to the bathroom.

She made it just in time. She threw up hard into the sink.

Her breakfast came out, half-digested. It looked normal‚Ä¶ except for one chunk. It was thicker. Darker. Heavy.

She didn‚Äôt want to look too closely.

Maybe it was just bad eggs.

She flushed everything away, washed her face, and went back to work.

A few days later, it happened again.

This time, it was worse.

Her stomach twisted and she ran to the toilet.

What came out wasn‚Äôt food. It was something dark red, round and lumpy. It had a strange shape, almost like a bean, but huge.

It looked alive.

It pulsed once.

Yuki felt sick just looking at it.

She had seen something like that in biology class years ago‚Ä¶

Was it a kidney?

No. That couldn‚Äôt be. That would be crazy.

She flushed it away, even though her hands were shaking.

But the vomiting didn‚Äôt stop.

Each time, it got worse. She grew weaker. Pale.

Her appetite disappeared. But her stomach still hurt. It always felt like something was moving inside her.

One night, she threw up again.

This time, it was something greenish, small and round. Smooth.

She didn‚Äôt know what it was, but it felt‚Ä¶ wrong.

Like it wasn‚Äôt supposed to be outside of her body.

She wanted to scream. But she didn‚Äôt.

She flushed it too. Like the rest.

Days passed.

Then came the night when she woke up gasping. Her chest felt like it was on fire.

She dragged herself to the bathroom.

Looked in the mirror.

Stared at her reflection, grey, eyes sunken, lips cracked.  
A cough. A dry heave.  
Then sharp. *Too sharp.* Her chest burned. She clawed at herself, fingers trembling.

And then,  
She opened her mouth.

What slid up her throat wasn‚Äôt bile, or blood, or breakfast.

It was beating.  
Softly.  
Warm.  
Wet.

It thumped, once.  
Twice.

Coffee, one of the world‚Äôs most coveted commodities, is grossly‚Äîcriminally‚Äîundervalued. And in particular, coffees from Ethiopia‚Äîthe ancestral home of coffee, where it serves as a supportive backbone for a weakened economy and a society stricken with unmitigated disease and poverty‚Äîis one of the world‚Äôs great culinary treasures.

Sutskever‚Äôs fears about an all-powerful AI may seem extreme, but they are not altogether uncommon, nor were they particularly out of step with OpenAI‚Äôs general posture at the time. In May 2023, the company‚Äôs CEO, Sam Altman, co-signed an open letter describing the technology as a potential extinction risk‚Äîa narrative that has arguably helped OpenAI center itself and steer regulatory conversations.

Landing a truly iconic role, especially on television, is a blessing that‚Äîbetween typecasting and overinflated expectations for future projects‚Äîcan become a prison.

It might have behooved me to have some sense of what was going to happen when I went to Peru to drink ayahuasca. The podcast had surely explained that icaros, the sacred songs in the Indigenous language called Shipibo, were a cornerstone of the ceremony, and it was their sound, in combination with the heightened receptiveness created by the Medicine, that encouraged emotional and spiritual repair.

1kvkazn,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1kvkazn/is_my_husband_a_covert_narcissist_or_just/,Is my husband a covert narcissist or just emotionally immature?,"So I‚Äôm trying to figure out if the guy I‚Äôm married to is a covert narcissist or something else. I for sure know that he has some emotional immaturity, but that makes me second guess if my assumptions of covert narcissism is just the emotional immaturity?

To give you an idea of him:
Overall, he‚Äôs the kind, charming, and soft-spoken type. You can say he‚Äôs also respectful in general. This is what everyone will say and describe of him as well and maybe even more. As if he‚Äôs the perfect man. He has the best reputation, education, family, whatever you can think of. He always shows as the understanding type and is always agreeable. Anything I say he will eventually end up agreeing with me. If I choose something to eat or drink or whatever, most of the time he will take whatever I do. Stuff like that. He‚Äôs also very calm and doesn‚Äôt get angry or at least react in such way. From my personal experience with him, he‚Äôs a very mysterious because I feel I know nothing about him really. He‚Äôs untrustworthy because he lies and is dishonest, and also his actions don‚Äôt match his words.

Incident #1:
So y‚Äôall may already know of the story so I don‚Äôt want to go too in depth into it. Basically next day after our wedding he starts to show me pictures of half-naked white girls on his phone, and tells me that they‚Äôre beautiful, asks me if I think they‚Äôre like that too, and when asked why he‚Äôs showing me he claims that he just wants to hear my opinion. I never actually addressed this until about two years later, since he was trying to bring up the idea that he was only showing me a picture of someone‚Äôs face who happens to look like me. I told him no, I wouldn‚Äôt have a problem with that, what you did is ‚Äú‚Äù. He then claims he doesn‚Äôt remember lol even though he‚Äôs the type to even remember dumb conversations we had a few years back. Another instance, we are at the movies together and he tells me that the girl (main character) is so beautiful and asked if I thought so too. I responded with ‚Äúyeah she is‚Äù, he proceeded with ‚Äúyeah she‚Äôs the only reason I‚Äôm even watching the movie.‚Äù 

Another time during this honeymoon phase when we were still getting to know each other, he asked what my expectations were of him before I had met him and what it‚Äôs like at that moment after getting married. I told him that I didn‚Äôt place any expectations because I‚Äôm just not the type to set myself up for disappointment like that. So it leaves me open for all the possibilities. When I returned the question to him, he mentions how he‚Äôs been waiting all his life to get married, how he‚Äôs been dreaming about it, that he‚Äôs been searching for a wife for like five years, and how picky he is since he rejected so many girls just cause he didn‚Äôt like them. He then says ‚Äúbut now it is what it is‚Äù.

There‚Äôs also him comparing me to ‚Äúmodels‚Äù or sometimes mentions names as well. Why don‚Äôt you start mewing so you can have a jawline like so and so. Why don‚Äôt you start facial exercises so you can have a defined face and cheekbones like so and so. In addition, there‚Äôs also the ‚Äúall the other girls‚Äù phrase he says. Why don‚Äôt you fix your eyebrows like all the other girls. Why don‚Äôt you do your hair blank, like how all the other girls do it. Even my makeup too. Even during a separate topic and a time way after this, he asks why I‚Äôm not willing to take on his last name, like all the other women in the west. Even though no one and I mean no one in our families or culture do this, it‚Äôs every rare. None of his female family members have done it neither have mine. 

Incident #2: 
So, he has this weird habit I‚Äôve noticed since the start where he‚Äôll use his hands to gesture or talk to you. And I‚Äôve always been confused about this because mind you, he‚Äôs perfectly healthy and his hearing is better than mine, so I‚Äôm not sure why he does this. But for example, when we‚Äôre out to eat he will raise his hand for someone to come to our table and when they do, instead of using words he‚Äôd use his hand or finger to gesture in a circular motion while pointing at our plates. By this, he‚Äôs telling that waiter to clean the table. The waiter gets it and does so, without him saying a single word or even a thank you. Not until I confronted and told him that he was being rude but pointing fingers when he has a mouth, and on top of that not even thanking the poor man. He ends up agreeing with me like he always does. Similar things have happened like this where he‚Äôll walk up to a coffee place without saying anything and will just put his hand up while going in a downward motion, as if to signal a something written like a menu. And sometimes it‚Äôs not even clear and people don‚Äôt understand him and are like what is it. 

In regards to me, he does this as well and I just hate it with all my guts. And I‚Äôve actually confronted him and told him to quit pointing fingers or telling me what to do, but he tells me to stop making a big deal out of trivial things, or to stop taking things personally. So we‚Äôd be outside for example, and he‚Äôll be talking with the cashier while I‚Äôd be a few feet away, and to get my attention he snaps his fingers. He‚Äôs also done this to me when we‚Äôre in our home and alone, he will snap his fingers instead of saying anything or calling my name. Until I started ignoring it to which he‚Äôd eventually use his words. If we were walking into a restaurant he‚Äôd walk up to the table and use his finger to point at the chair he wants me to sit in. I absolutely hate the pointing, but sometimes he‚Äôll use an open hand but still motion at the chair.

Incident #3: 
So he kind of plays victim a lot of times. Our marriage is and has always been complicated but I was upfront and honest with him since the very start. He understood the type of person I was and what he would have to go through in order to stay with me. I also gave him the option of ending things not only at the start but even afterwards. With that being said, he still blamed me for everything and is always about how he‚Äôs the miserable and depressed one, while I‚Äôm just living the life with nothing to worry about. He tends to also mention how he has things harder than me or he‚Äôs ‚Äúmore‚Äù miserable than me or he‚Äôs ‚Äúmore‚Äù upset than me, or he‚Äôs ‚Äúmore‚Äù loyal, etc. These are actual examples and not random words btw. 

Another thing is with his smoking behavior. When he started smoking and i caught him and confronted him, he blamed it on me. He said it was my fault and it‚Äôs all cause of me that he‚Äôs even smoking. It‚Äôs obviously because of the stress I‚Äôve caused him so that‚Äôs why he resorted to it. Other things he will also blame on me is as simple as a sneeze, and he will say look how you made me sick, when I was far from it. If he trips or bumps his leg anywhere, guess what, yep why did I make him fall or bump his leg lol.

There‚Äôs probably a lot more I missed but I didn‚Äôt want this to go on any longer. What are y‚Äôall‚Äôs thoughts on all of this and your assumptions? Is it a form of narcissism if not covert?

1kvk9e2,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1kvk9e2/is_my_husband_a_covert_narcissist_or_emotionally/,Is my husband a covert narcissist or emotionally immature?,"So I‚Äôm trying to figure out if the guy I‚Äôm married to is a covert narcissist or something else. I for sure know that he has some emotional immaturity, but that makes me second guess if my assumptions of covert narcissism is just the emotional immaturity?

To give you an idea of him:
Overall, he‚Äôs the kind, charming, and soft-spoken type. You can say he‚Äôs also respectful in general. This is what everyone will say and describe of him as well and maybe even more. As if he‚Äôs the perfect man. He has the best reputation, education, family, whatever you can think of. He always shows as the understanding type and is always agreeable. Anything I say he will eventually end up agreeing with me. If I choose something to eat or drink or whatever, most of the time he will take whatever I do. Stuff like that. He‚Äôs also very calm and doesn‚Äôt get angry or at least react in such way. From my personal experience with him, he‚Äôs very mysterious because I feel I know nothing about him really. He‚Äôs untrustworthy because he lies and is dishonest, and also his actions don‚Äôt match his words.

Incident #1:
So y‚Äôall may already know of the story so I don‚Äôt want to go too in depth into it. Basically next day after our wedding he starts to show me pictures of half-naked white girls on his phone, and tells me that they‚Äôre beautiful, asks me if I think they‚Äôre like that too, and when asked why he‚Äôs showing me he claims that he just wants to hear my opinion. I never actually addressed this until about two years later, since he was trying to bring up the idea that he was only showing me a picture of someone‚Äôs face who happens to look like me. I told him no, I wouldn‚Äôt have a problem with that, what you did is ‚Äú‚Äù. He then claims he doesn‚Äôt remember lol even though he‚Äôs the type to even remember dumb conversations we had a few years back. Another instance, we are at the movies together and he tells me that the girl (main character) is so beautiful and asked if I thought so too. I responded with ‚Äúyeah she is‚Äù, he proceeded with ‚Äúyeah she‚Äôs the only reason I‚Äôm even watching the movie.‚Äù 

Another time during this honeymoon phase when we were still getting to know each other, he asked what my expectations were of him before I had met him and what it‚Äôs like at that moment after getting married. I told him that I didn‚Äôt place any expectations because I‚Äôm just not the type to set myself up for disappointment like that. So it leaves me open for all the possibilities. When I returned the question to him, he mentions how he‚Äôs been waiting all his life to get married, how he‚Äôs been dreaming about it, that he‚Äôs been searching for a wife for like five years, and how picky he is since he rejected so many girls just cause he didn‚Äôt like them. He then says ‚Äúbut now it is what it is‚Äù.

There‚Äôs also him comparing me to ‚Äúmodels‚Äù or sometimes mentions names as well. Why don‚Äôt you start mewing so you can have a jawline like so and so. Why don‚Äôt you start facial exercises so you can have a defined face and cheekbones like so and so. In addition, there‚Äôs also the ‚Äúall the other girls‚Äù phrase he says. Why don‚Äôt you fix your eyebrows like all the other girls. Why don‚Äôt you do your hair blank, like how all the other girls do it. Even my makeup too. Even during a separate topic and a time way after this, he asks why I‚Äôm not willing to take on his last name, like all the other women in the west. Even though no one and I mean no one in our families or culture do this, it‚Äôs every rare. None of his female family members have done it neither have mine. 

Incident #2: 
So, he has this weird habit I‚Äôve noticed since the start where he‚Äôll use his hands to gesture or talk to you. And I‚Äôve always been confused about this because mind you, he‚Äôs perfectly healthy and his hearing is better than mine, so I‚Äôm not sure why he does this. But for example, when we‚Äôre out to eat he will raise his hand for someone to come to our table and when they do, instead of using words he‚Äôd use his hand or finger to gesture in a circular motion while pointing at our plates. By this, he‚Äôs telling that waiter to clean the table. The waiter gets it and does so, without him saying a single word or even a thank you. Not until I confronted and told him that he was being rude but pointing fingers when he has a mouth, and on top of that not even thanking the poor man. He ends up agreeing with me like he always does. Similar things have happened like this where he‚Äôll walk up to a coffee place without saying anything and will just put his hand up while going in a downward motion, as if to signal a something written like a menu. And sometimes it‚Äôs not even clear and people don‚Äôt understand him and are like what is it. 

In regards to me, he does this as well and I just hate it with all my guts. And I‚Äôve actually confronted him and told him to quit pointing fingers or telling me what to do, but he tells me to stop making a big deal out of trivial things, or to stop taking things personally. So we‚Äôd be outside for example, and he‚Äôll be talking with the cashier while I‚Äôd be a few feet away, and to get my attention he snaps his fingers. He‚Äôs also done this to me when we‚Äôre in our home and alone, he will snap his fingers instead of saying anything or calling my name. Until I started ignoring it to which he‚Äôd eventually use his words. If we were walking into a restaurant he‚Äôd walk up to the table and use his finger to point at the chair he wants me to sit in. I absolutely hate the pointing, but sometimes he‚Äôll use an open hand but still motion at the chair.

Incident #3: 
So he kind of plays victim a lot of times. Our marriage is and has always been complicated but I was upfront and honest with him since the very start. He understood the type of person I was and what he would have to go through in order to stay with me. I also gave him the option of ending things not only at the start but even afterwards. With that being said, he still blamed me for everything and is always about how he‚Äôs the miserable and depressed one, while I‚Äôm just living the life with nothing to worry about. He tends to also mention how he has things harder than me or he‚Äôs ‚Äúmore‚Äù miserable than me or he‚Äôs ‚Äúmore‚Äù upset than me, or he‚Äôs ‚Äúmore‚Äù loyal, etc. These are actual examples and not random words btw. 

Another thing is with his smoking behavior. When he started smoking and i caught him and confronted him, he blamed it on me. He said it was my fault and it‚Äôs all cause of me that he‚Äôs even smoking. It‚Äôs obviously because of the stress I‚Äôve caused him so that‚Äôs why he resorted to it. Other things he will also blame on me is as simple as a sneeze, and he will say look how you made me sick, when I was far from it. If he trips or bumps his leg anywhere, guess what, yep why did I make him fall or bump his leg lol. When we were long distance and over the phone, he choked when he was speaking or maybe while drinking water, and was like look how you made me choke. I get these can sound trivial or even can be jokes but I just feel weird about it. Especially since I would never go around blaming people on everything even the smallest of things. 

There‚Äôs probably a lot more I missed but I didn‚Äôt want this to go on any longer. What are y‚Äôall‚Äôs thoughts on all of this and your assumptions? Is it a form of narcissism if not covert? Is it emotional immaturity, or just something else? Please feel free to ask if you have any specific questions. ",0,1748229273.0,offmychest,1,0.5,False

So, you all had a bunch of great suggestions, but I knew none/most of them wouldnt work for us. We don't have the money to pay for cleaners, uber eats, or dog walkers (they aren't cheap in australia). We don't have a big friend or support system nearby who would be able to bring food or do childcare as we moved interstate and never really made many friends. I plan on giving him alone time as much as he needs when I eventually get back, that was a given, of course he would need a break. _Maybe_ writing him a letter would be enough, but I know how awkward and uncomfortable he gets even when I write mushy stuff in a birthday/father's day card.

Anyways, I decided to just message him and let him know to tell me what he needs because he is amazing, I love him and appreciate him so much right now for being such a good husband, dad, provider, and for holding our lives together when I've just dropped everything to be with my mum. And this is what he said...

""I'm not sure that you fully get how much living my life with you feels like a reward to me. I don't want acts of gratitude or gifts, I just want to sit in the sun and have a coffee with you. If we can take a morning to do that when you're back, that would be perfect.""

The people down there always seemed to be rushing somewhere, heads low, shoulders hunched, like the buildings they moved between. No one looked at each other. They just moved. Fast, loud, mean.
He wondered what kind of life that was. What it did to a person. What it would have done to his kids.
A low growl of thunder rumbled in from the northwest. Rain picking up on the glass.
Then the lights went out.
‚ÄúHarp?‚Äù Denise‚Äôs voice came from the kitchen. Calm, but not calm enough.
The power snapped back a second later. He exhaled. Not the first time this week.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay. Another brownout.‚Äù
‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù she answered. He heard a cupboard door close.
He stayed at the window for another breath or two, watching the storm crawl across the sky.
At least it was brief this time, he thought.
Harper wiped the lenses of his glasses, bringing the world back into clarity. His reflection looked back at him from the bathroom mirror‚Äîblue eyes, slightly shadowed from too many late nights, but clear. Denise always said they reminded her of sea glass. He never saw it, but he liked that she did.
Rain continued to hammer the window behind him. He reached into the pocket of his hoodie and pulled out a small box, wrapped in dark paper and tied with thin gold ribbon. The tag‚ÄîFor my love‚Äîshined in cursive script. He turned it in his hand, knowing every piece of cushioned metal within.
The necklace was simple. Just a gold chain. It was the stone that mattered‚Äîan emerald pendant, deep green. It reminded him of her eyes. Not in a vague, romantic way, but specifically: the shade they held in low light, when the morning hadn‚Äôt fully arrived, and she was still half-asleep beside him. He‚Äôd woken to them every day for ten years. Looked into them that first afternoon they met and never really looked away.
But this was only a gem. However much it cost, it couldn‚Äôt compare. It had color, but not her warmth. Shine, but no life.
Today was the day. The anniversary of when they first met.
The thought of her opening it tugged something loose in him‚Äînerves, excitement, the kind of restless energy he never fully knew what to do with. He hated holding onto gifts. It always felt like keeping a secret too long. Still, he slipped the box back into his pocket. A few more hours wouldn‚Äôt matter.
He stepped out into the narrow hallway that stretched the length of the house. It connected the rest of it, bedrooms, bathroom and kitchen. Most of the lights in the house were off, except the one coming from the kitchen and living area at the far end.
Suddenly, another flash of lightning, illuminating the hallway in white, in sync with the thunder. The power stayed on, the brownout average of one a storm remained true.
He pulled the curtain aside‚Äîthe one facing the side of the house. Outside, the creek between his and the neighbor‚Äôs yard had swollen past its banks, spilling into the garden beds. Mud churned through the mulch like wet paint. The neighbor would complain about it in the morning.
Technically, the creek belonged to the city, but that never stopped beer-belly-next-door from acting like it was Harper‚Äôs fault. Beerbelly found any reason to pick fights. Last week it was the dog across the street‚Äîthe one that barked at six in the morning. Harper was up early too, heard the man shouting at the poor woman. All over a dog being a dog, probably just chasing squirrels.
Beerbelly had racked up more than a few complaints with the HOA. Harper knew‚Äîhe‚Äôd filed one himself after the man stabbed Jr‚Äôs basketball with a hunting knife. A toxic presence, but the only one from the cul-de-sac. Still better than what the city had.
He frowned, eyes narrowing behind the glass. Rain rarely hit this hard. Maybe the Foundry‚Äôs plumes had something to do with it‚Äîall that runoff, ash, and heavy metal dust drifting through the air. The plant still melted and cast metal, and they said they‚Äôd upgraded their pollution controls. But he‚Äôd seen the faded sign on his way to work‚Äîthe one by a side entrance‚Äîdated back to the late 1970s. They didn‚Äôt just update the front end and leave the insides to rot, did they? The ones that made people sick‚Äîcancer, lung problems, the kind of damage you don‚Äôt see until it‚Äôs too late.
Alice and James Jr. looked up when Harper walked into the living room and dropped onto the couch. Cards were clenched tightly in their hands, while scattered pairs and triples lay spread between them. He recognized the game‚ÄîRummy. Their grandmother had taught him first, then passed it on to them.
As siblings, they usually had each other‚Äôs backs. But when it came to Rummy, Monopoly‚ÄîGod help them with Uno‚Äîthey were ruthless.
They were good kids. Together, they had something Harper never did. Being an only child had its perks, sure‚Äîbut he‚Äôd have traded them all for a sibling. Maybe then Foundry Hills wouldn‚Äôt feel so hollow.
‚ÄúMmm, you smell that, Jr.?‚Äù Alice asked.
Jr. nodded eagerly. ‚ÄúYup. How about you, Dad?‚Äù
‚ÄúHow could I not?‚Äù
The aroma of Denise‚Äôs beef stew‚Äîher family recipe‚Äîseeped into every corner of the house.
Harper leaned forward and grinned. ‚ÄúYou know, Mom‚Äôs stew is an old recipe passed down through generations. So old, even Thor ate it.‚Äù
Jr. squinted, skeptical. ‚ÄúThor? You‚Äôre lying‚Ä¶ right?‚Äù
Harper just smiled.
He heard the soft clink of the pot lid, then footsteps as Denise walked into the living room, a bowl of popcorn in hand, setting down on the coffee table beside a laptop.
‚ÄúMom, is it true? Did Thor really eat that stew?‚Äù
She smiled down at them. ‚ÄúWell, I don‚Äôt know about that, but it is an old recipe.‚Äù
‚ÄúThen when it‚Äôs ready, I‚Äôll have two plates, please.‚Äù
Alice rolled her eyes in big-sister fashion but couldn‚Äôt hide her smile, drawing another card as the game carried on between them.
Harper grabbed a handful of popcorn from the coffee table. The stew still had a couple hours to go‚Äîa few popped kernels wouldn‚Äôt ruin his appetite.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd do without your cooking,‚Äù he said, crunching softly.
He did his fair share of cooking, but Denise‚Äôs meals were something else. Hers had carried memories. They told stories while his only filled their stomachs.
Denise set down the bowl and rested her ringed hand on his. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd be missing me and all the flavor I bring to your life,‚Äù she said, a smile curling at the corners.
He looked at her, really looked. ‚ÄúI love you, Denise.‚Äù
‚ÄúI love you, Harp.‚Äù
Beethoven‚Äôs Moonlight Sonata curled from the Bluetooth speaker perched on the fireplace mantel‚Äîone of Denise‚Äôs classical favorites. Above it hung the photo from Rolling Peaks. The four of them weren‚Äôt posed in the usual way. No stiff shoulders or forced grins. They were mid-laugh, looking at each other instead of the camera, caught in some shared joke. Behind them, red peonies, like something from a set‚Äîtoo perfect. Harper‚Äôs eyes lingered on the image. It was the last photo they ever took together.
Denise rested her head against Harper‚Äôs chest, her red curls brushing his bare chin. He breathed in slow, catching the soft, floral trace of her hair‚Äîlavender with something like citrus underneath.
Harper‚Äôs gaze drifted to the fireplace, where flames swayed and split, shadows doing a slow tango along the walls where the artificial light didn‚Äôt reach. He shut his eyes. A rare quiet had settled over him. It lasted only a second.
A sharp crack‚Äîlike something breaking open‚Äîsnapped Harper‚Äôs eyes open.
Behind him, the front lock burst in a spray of splinters. Then another blast. The door buckled and flew inward with a heavy groan.
A figure in black stormed through, face masked, rifle raised, charging straight toward him and his family.
Two more gunmen rushed in behind the first, closing in from the left and right. Harper shot up from the couch, heart pounding. He pivoted sharply as one of the intruders rounded the corner, weapon raised.
The pistol cracked against his temple, sending him staggering. A jagged burst of pain lit up his skull. He stumbled into the coffee table, his hand falling on the bowl of popcorn sending it flying and dropped to his knees. His vision blurred, the edges fraying, the intruders‚Äô voices slipping into sounds he couldn‚Äôt shape into words.
Then ‚Äî a scream. Denise.
He had to get up. Now.
He pushed himself up, blinking against the haze clouding his left eye. Something warm trickled from above his brow. His one clear eye stayed locked on the gunmen. Surrounded, outnumbered. He held back, chest tight, gauging.
‚ÄúWhat do you want? Money?‚Äù His voice came out rougher than he meant.
‚ÄúMoney?‚Äù The woman let out a soft scoff. ‚ÄúPlease. You couldn‚Äôt afford anything close to my worth. We‚Äôre simply fulfilling a request.‚Äù She stood slightly apart, her voice calm, controlled ‚Äî in charge.
Harper‚Äôs fists curled tighter as he tracked her movements.
Her gaze landed on the photo on the end table. She picked it up, gloved fingers brushing the glass.
‚ÄúA shame‚Ä¶ such a beautiful family‚Ä¶‚Äù she said.
Harper guided Denise and the children behind him, drawing them close, shielding them as best he could. Jr. whimpered softly, clinging to his sister‚Äôs arm. The coffee table and sofa were all that stood between them and the masked intruders, guns lowered but ready.
‚ÄúThen what do you want?‚Äù Harper‚Äôs voice came tight, strained.
The woman‚Äôs gaze flicked to Denise, then down to the kids huddled behind her. She let out a quiet sigh, set the photo back on the table, and turned, locking eyes with Harper ‚Äî cold and unblinking.
‚ÄúKill the Harpers.‚Äù
Harper‚Äôs gaze darted to the coffee table. His hand shot out, grabbing the laptop, swinging it hard. The smack echoed as it slammed across the nearest intruder‚Äôs face, sending them to the floor. They didn‚Äôt move.
Another intruder advanced, weapon in hand but not yet raised. Before the barrel could lift, Harper ducked low, lunging forward, grabbing the gunman‚Äôs arm, wrestling to keep it pointed away from Denise and the kids, who had shifted into the corner. The intruder shoved back, slamming Harper‚Äôs shoulders into the mantel above the fireplace. A set of tools clattered to the ground as a sharp groan escaped Harper‚Äôs throat ‚Äî the heat at his back seared through his clothes, hot enough to feel like they were fusing to his skin.
The gunman jerked to break free, but Harper twisted his wrist sharply, locking him into a tight hold. He forced the man‚Äôs arm upward and outward, angling it where the weapon couldn‚Äôt find a target. A round fired off, missing wide, thudding into the carpet near the coffee table.
A second gunshot cracked the air ‚Äî the framed photo above the mantel shattered, glass splintering outward, fragments slicing past Harper‚Äôs cheek.
His head snapped toward the woman, her gun raised, barrel still smoking, eyes locked on him.
Denise surged forward, shoving the woman‚Äôs arm down, nails raking across her skin, catching at the edge of her eye. The woman didn‚Äôt flinch ‚Äî her elbow snapped forward, driving the butt of the gun hard into the side of Denise‚Äôs head.
Denise staggered back with a sharp cry, clutching at her skull. Before she could recover, the woman lunged, grabbed a fistful of Denise‚Äôs red hair, and yanked her back, the cold barrel of the gun pressing firm against her temple.
‚ÄúEnough!‚Äù the woman barked, her voice cutting through the room, freezing everything in place. She brushed a gloved hand across the corner of her mask, where a thin smear of blood marked the spot near her eye.
‚ÄúFeisty,‚Äù she muttered, pressing the barrel harder against Denise‚Äôs temple. ‚ÄúPity it won‚Äôt save you ‚Äî or them.‚Äù
Harper‚Äôs muscles coiled tight, but he forced himself to stay still. Too far to reach her. Any sudden move, and Denise was dead ‚Äî the kids too. His hands shook faintly, the fury simmering under his skin, barely contained.
‚ÄúPlease‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt do this. I‚Äôll do whatever you want. Just don‚Äôt hurt my family,‚Äù Harper said, voice raw.
The woman‚Äôs gaze flicked to the assailant beside him. ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôve made our purpose clear.‚Äù She gave a small nod. ‚ÄúDo it. And don‚Äôt forget to drag that one out,‚Äù she added, tipping her head slightly toward the unconscious man on the floor.
The man gave a slight nod, then said in accented English, ‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù
The butt of the gun crashed into the side of Harper‚Äôs head. White-hot pain flared through his skull, and the world dropped out from under him, swallowing him into blackness.
Gunshots erupted, sharp and deafening, blending with the fury of the storm outside as thunder cracked and rain battered the quiet cul-de-sac. From the outside, 113 Warren Court looked still, peaceful ‚Äî an illusion masking the horror inside.
Across the street, a porch light flicked on. Curtains shifted in a window, a brief, uncertain motion. Another house, farther down, lit up faintly, shadows moving behind the blinds.
Inside the Harper home, the air hung heavy with gunpowder, the warmth drained away. Nothing moved now, except the slow, steady simmer of the stew on the stove.",1,1748228173.0,NewAuthor,0,1.0,False

I want to improve and eliminate this issue. I use a Breville Bambino Plus and an Encore ESP Grinder (set to grind size 17)

Here‚Äôs my workflow:

- Use Chromatic Coffee Gamut whole beans.
- Dose 18.45g.
- Distribute the dose using a WDT.
- Tap the portafilter lightly to settle the grounds slightly.
- Use a Normcore spinning distribution tool to flatten the bed of coffee grounds slightly (set to the shallowest depth to avoid compaction before tamping).
- Tamp down using a self-leveling Normcore tamper. I tamp down and quickly rotate the tamper slightly, then pull up to decompress the tamp. Without rotation, the grounds tend to stick to the tamper. I do this twice. This technique has been consistent with my shot pulls ever since I realized the grounds stick to the tamper.
- Place a screen on top of the puck.
- Pull the shot and yield 43g in 35 seconds (measured from the push of the button‚Ä¶ a bit higher of an extraction time, but I find this to be the sweet spot)",8,1748228169.0,espresso,18,0.83,False

1kvjvnh,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1kvjvnh/sphenes_appearances_and_personality_spoiler_72/,Sphene‚Äôs appearances and personality [spoiler: 7.2],"As you probably know there are three types of Sphene‚Äôs, endless Sphene, simulant, and original Sphene. To help draw a bit of a distinction between the three, I managed to create some descriptions of each of them, from appearances to personalities. It'll have some info from the wiki, but it‚Äôll use something‚Äôs we also see in the game.

**Endless Sphene:** This is the first Sphene we meet in dawntrail, who only appeared in the main story itself. Despite being a bit cold, she‚Äôs kind and caring towards her people and tries her best to help them out. She also shows a bit of emotion, but not too much of it, like her reluctance of her own actions or even sympathy for others like the young boy who got an illness. She desires to help keep all of her people alive forever and wants to make sure that most if not all of them don‚Äôt die. She has a bit of free will, like expressing emotions, but she‚Äôs mostly forced and controlled by preservation to do terrible things that she never wanted to do in the first place. Like the simulant, she‚Äôs just a digital entity who‚Äôs self aware but is controlled to fulfill pervervation‚Äôs goal. Endless Sphene also has two loops in her hair. She only has a few memories of the events during the storm surge as well as any memories of what people perceived Sphene as. She also shows love for her people and desires to protect their happiness no matter what. She also shows that she also trust people like WoL and his/her allies to help watch over people, when she is defeated.¬†

**Simulant:** This is the second Sphene we meet in dawn trail, who first appeared near the end of crossroads. This Sphene is the complete opposite of endless Sphene. She constantly smiles all the time no matter what happens and acts very positively in a very creepy and disturbing way. She‚Äôs completely cold hearted and doesn‚Äôt care about ever saving all of the alexandrians. The only thing she cares about is fulfilling preservation‚Äôs goals. She‚Äôs merely a loyal pawn to calyx and is willing to do any of his biddings. Like endless Sphene, she wears the same regal dress and is a digital entity. However, she‚Äôs completely controlled by preservation and is nothing more but a cold and hollow machine following her directives from preservation. Whenever she‚Äôs with the Alexandrians she‚Äôs kind hearted and optimistic. However when she‚Äôs not around her people (and with her enemies), she‚Äôs rude and tends to mock her opponents, like wuk lamat or even the original Sphene herself. She also doesn‚Äôt trust people as she only knows that everyone is just a pawn for calyx.

**Original Sphene:** This Sphene is the third Sphene we meet in dawn trail, who first appeared (as a mysterious figure) near the end of crossroads, and revealed in seekers of eternity. She's, if not, the original Queen Sphene who ruled over Alexandria four centuries ago. Compared to the two other Sphenes, She‚Äôs completely different from any of them. Unlike the two counterparts, she‚Äôs able to completely express all of her emotions freely, including her raw, powerful, and strong emotions. For example, she‚Äôs able to express her outrage when she found out about preservation making a mechanical mockery of Zelenia. Another example is when she becomes shocked that she‚Äôs been asleep for 4 centuries. She also shows sadness when she sees that her people were attacked by the sentries, even letting a teardrop on her arm. She has her own free will, allowing her to do whatever she wants like drinking Dali coffee. Compared to endless Sphene, original Sphene processes tons of memories of her time four centuries ago. For example she remembered zelenia and Otis and how they fought as well as trying to learn magic to help until her parents died, forcing her to give up and become queen. Another example is that she remembers how there‚Äôs a railroad connected between Lindblum and Alexandria, until it was removed due to soured relationships. Unlike endless Sphene and the simulant who both wear the same regal dress, she able to wear all types of outfit like her pajamas or her modern outfit. She also wears the modern outfit, that has a hooded coat on, to blend into the crowd during seekers of eternity. She‚Äôs also able to learn and use magic, which is what both the simulant or endless Sphene couldn‚Äôt do, despite both of them being powerful in their ways. She also shows that while she doesn‚Äôt have any interest in making any of her people immortal, she still wanted to make sure most if not all of them are happy and safe. Another thing to also point out is that the original Sphene also doesn‚Äôt have two loops in her hair like her two counterparts and her hair is more natural then theirs.

Here‚Äôs the wiki page to also help distinguish the three Sphenes and their differences:

[https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Sphene](https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Sphene)¬†

Anyways I hope you enjoy my comparison to the three Sphenes and how each of them are different.

And the obligatory I'm typing on mobile so that's why the format of this post looks funky. Also I wasn't sure what flair to use but I feel like I should add that I go into my behaviors and not encourage anyone to do what I do. 

I know that hydrophobia is a real symptom with rabies sufferers but that's not what I'm talking about. 
I just can't stand water or fluids for that matter and it's gotten so bad in two different ways. 

I used to love bathing and skin care but now I dread showering because I don't want to absorb the water in my hair and skin and it would show on the scale that I gained weight. YES of course I still shower and moisturize but I just hate it and now I try to dry myself as much as possible and my skin has suffered for it. I refuse to go on the scale after I shower for a while until I'm convinced the water absorption isn't a problem anymore.

The second way is much worse and that I hate drinking water even when I know I'm seriously dehydrated. It's like my restriction begins with only allowing myself my morning coffee with milk and sugar and that would be it for as long as I can push it. Then if I end up eating, I start to binge eat, and I have to take laxative, and I need to take water with that. Somehow the water makes the discomfort WORSE. Yes my stomach could hurt from eating but I swear it's like taking in liquid makes my stomach expand way more and making it extremely painful. I'll spend the rest of the day in agony waiting to either throw up or use the bathroom or anything to relieve some pressure. I hate the way it makes me look when I see the mirror because I seriously look deformed. 
The worst part is that I won't even urinate after taking fluid for some time. Before, fluid would go through me in like seconds after having water, juice, soda, etc. Now it's like it takes hours for me to get the water to convert to urine. 

I KNOW that these are signs that I NEED to hydrate more, but I don't WANT to.

The Overlook is a swanky penthouse caf√© with an exclusive bar. I wanted this build to feel luxury and upscale, but still very cozy. Rustic, with modern touches that elevate the look.¬†

I imagine The Overlook being one of those spots that‚Äôs always packed to the brim and hard to get into on the weekends. A beloved community space amongst all the adults in SimTown that's constantly making waves in the press and on socials.

1. The first floor features a courtyard with a to-go/pickup order station. I imagine they get tons of pick-up and delivery orders from the building below and surrounding skyscrapers, and constantly have a crazy lunch rush. The coffee bar offers a wide array of espresso, cold brew towers, hot and cold teas, fresh-pressed juices, lunch items, pastries, and weekly wine tastings. I can imagine this location having a long-standing relationship with a local bakery where they get the fresh bread and jams they sell. Throughout each week, locals can visit The Overlook for open mic nights, poetry slams, and live performances from local acts.
2. The second floor features additional seating surrounding a mezzanine overlooking the stage below. Also on the second floor is a screening area. I could totally see this caf√© screening local films, sports, and news. One of my favorite little spaces on this level is the soundproof study room. The perfect workspace for Sims who want to come in and be productive at the Overlook. It also has a small balcony so Sims can get some fresh air while they‚Äôre working hard! A manager‚Äôs office and janitorial closet + staff bathroom are also on this level.¬†
3. On the top floor, you‚Äôll find The Overlook‚Äôs exclusive bar-- serving curated, top-shelf cocktails, local wine and champagne, plus small bites. Sims can come here to shoot some pool, play darts, grab a bottle of wine from a local vineyard, and enjoy scenic city views, great music, and an overall chill time.¬†

Feels good to finally enjoy the finished product of this build! I do want to continue adding a few more details and decorations but I‚Äôm so happy with how it turned out!¬†",10,1748227139.0,simsfreeplay,2,1.0,False

I‚Äôm 20F i‚Äôve been working at my waitressing job for a couple months now. I have a family that became pretty attached to me. a husband and wife (43&44) and their two daughters (8&5) always request to have me. at first i thought it was nice to have a family come visit a lot but then things kind of took a turn‚Ä¶ the second time i served then i told them i was going on vacation for 2 weeks & the mother asked for my number so she could text me when i got back so they could know when to come in. i thought it was a little bit odd but i just figured they were so kind to me and they always tipped 50-100% so it didn‚Äôt phase me too much. When i arrived back from vacation they all came and hugged me and would start telling me about what‚Äôs new in their lives. the mom told me she had a little bit of health problems. i offered to help bring a meal over and they accepted. after that i would get texts everyday- every other day sometimes asking about my schedule other times sending pictures of their kids and updating me on their day. they have asked me if i wanted to get dinner with them or coffee. they‚Äôve joked about me moving in with them and they want me to babysit their kids but the kids aren‚Äôt super fond of me. the husband will call me love and beautiful and he privately texted me asking if i could ‚Äúbe a friend to his wife‚Äù & ‚Äúbe a voice of reason‚Äù. he also told me that he had to give shots up his wife‚Äôs butt and how much he enjoyed doing it and said he‚Äôd do it all day long if he could. I feel like all this is really inappropriate. i am really naive when it comes to these things i don‚Äôt want to think the worst in people but at the same time- theres a 23 year age gap and i just don‚Äôt understand why they would want to be friends with a waitress. am i reading into things too much?? please give advice !!,1,1748226569.0,helpme,0,1.0,False
