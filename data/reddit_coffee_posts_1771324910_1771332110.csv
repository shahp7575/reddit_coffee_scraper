1r74x96,https://i.redd.it/67z4c7sev1kg1.jpeg,Headhunter II,"The sorcerer had a funny thought, as he gazed down on all of the neon squalor glow of the Fallen Angel City below him from the rooftops edge.  

The Nazis were right. You are a degenerate species…

It was all of it a swollen pustule sac. A land of green milk and curdled cheese, cockroaches swam in the stew of discharge and mire and laughably called it a metropolitan. A cultural hub. 

A blade of a smile formed amongst a tumult of dark and ageless hair, a wizard's haggard beard. Blasted by sand and sun just like the rest of the white robed man. White robed death. 

Some say he is the mad author of the Necronomicon. He has authored the destruction of countless cities, countless places… before this one. 

Jericho. Troy. Münster. Constantinople. Alexandria. Roanoke. Ikeshima. Rome. 

And many others… great and small. He doesn't care. He only loved to watch as the red hand of Iblis crawled across the blackening surface of all things dying in its embrace, turning the whole of the world into its killing floor. 

But that wasn't all with this place. No. He was sent here not just to burn but to gather intelligence for the order. 

And to contest. 

…

Homicide was scrambling. They had nothing. What commonalities they did find between the victims was interesting… but it only led to more bafflement. More flummoxed minds in the busying police departments all across the city. All bullshit pretension had been dropped, all departments across all counties and neighborhoods were working together on this one, to bring the crazy fucking bastard in. 

But still they had nothing. Except that he liked to chop off heads. And leave them at churches for some fucking reason. 

And one other thing. One oddity that more than a few of the sharper minds amongst the rank and file of criminal investigators found to be interesting. 

But did it mean anything? 

All of them. Every head found belonged to someone with a rap sheet that read more like a tome. Miles long some of em. Each and every one of em had a history. 

Mob hits! that was the popular running theory around the suits and their steaming white paper cups of coffee. 

It wasn't a bad one, most thought. 

Could be. Could be.

…

Azræl leapt from the dark and charged into the man as he was making his way to his car. Slamming him into the driver's door as he tried to open it and catching him by surprise. 

This was the one. This was one of the faces the goat-shape demanded be brought before her feet. 

His hand, clenched tightly round the hilt of his great sword came up and bashed the maggot across the mouth with the metal pommel of the weapon. A crack, and a splurt of hot blood and teeth out the mouth and the maggot went down to his knees, mewling. 

Where he belonged. 

The maggot struggled to speak and beg as the headhunter raised his great blade above his head. Readying to strike. 

“Not at all for you or yourself. Swear to her. Pray to me.” said Azræl as he brought the blade down and cleaved the head free from the rest of the meat. It tumble-jumped with a ropey-cord tail of thick black red that the stump continued to produce and shoot in dark gouts for a moment before the headless body collapsed to the street. 

And then the night was quiet again. All around.  Lights buzzed and mock heaven glowed. 

The peace was relative, conditionary. You could still hear the ghost song of sirens in the distance. Wailing away in flight, in search, in search of anything. 

Azræl picked up the head and said his prayers to the goat-shaped lord of his house and order. He tied it to the belt of his hulking black leather visage to join two others and went on his way. 

The sorcerer watched. The sorcerer was impressed. 

…

He heaved. Spewed. Decorated the sidewalk and gutter in more bile, blood and stomach lining as another sharp stab in his stomach racked his guts and his convulsion threatened to roll over into a seizing tear in his brain. 

Homeless and well past his last leg, Elton prayed for death as his sickened body worsened on the pavement, alone at the bus stop. Underneath the flickering glow of a dying bulb, a failing light. 

It was not death he received but something more spectacular. Elton, Grabby to his friends and scum and fellow urchins of the street, was made audience and thus unwitting chronicler to a chapter in a shadow conflict centuries upon centuries old, perhaps the oldest conflict in all of man's time. Perhaps even older than that. 

Grabby/Elton looked up from his own bloody spew of booze and lining and watched a giant titan walk into view. Destroying his solitude on this witching houred boulevard. 

He knew he must be fucked. The guy looked massive and he looked like Mad Max or the Terminator or someone like that and he looked like he was carrying a huge fucking sword. 

And along his belt were a buncha fuckin heads…

No fucking way. The dying urchin refused it. No fuckin way am I actually seein that fuckin thing. 

But real or not, the giant of myth and flesh and chained leather continued to march up and then past the druggie’s view, crossing to and then down the opposite side of the street. 

But then something made the headhunter stop. 

Elton heard it too. 

A note.  Notes. Music. 

A wind pattern series flurry of intricate and delicate notes whispered and alternate sharp-stab blasted through the nighttime witching air. Filling it. Dominating the scene. 

Azræl tensed cat-like coiled as his hair stood on end. The music was flute-like. Middle Eastern flavored…

Goddamit. No.

The headhunter was filled with dread. 

The music stopped. An ancient voice, bold, cut through the night. 

“How are you, German? Been long time."" 

His stance shifted to battle ready as his blade came up raised. His voice, louder, cut through the night as well to the speaker unseen. But he knew who it was to whom he spoke. 

""What do you want, snake?”

Laughter. Real. The knight Azræl always was good for a laugh as far the sorcerer was concerned.

“So funny?"" Azræl said to the night all around him. “Come out and show me what's so funny, witch."" 

More laughter. 

“Have we not shared many things over the long years, my friend? Such a long time. A great deal.”

A series of images flicker-shot through the headhunter's mind then. Whether put there by the devilry of the sorcerer or memories of his own from one of many possible past lives, Azræl was not sure. If he lived through this encounter he would meditate and pray on the matter later. 

If he lived through this encounter. 

His mind's eye:

The forests and the forest people and their villages are burning. There is much bloodletting. The ground is gorged, it cannot possibly drink up all of it. It sloshes about the ankles of the soldiering and the marching and the frantic frightened running. The pursuers too. The blood that chokes the earth sloshes mire-like about the furnace steps of them all. Charlemagne has demanded these pagan northmen be put to kneel before the cross or be put to the sword. Slavery for their women and children…

… and the knights were thus dispatched thither…

The headhunter severed the line of thought or memory or whatever it was with brutal sudden cunning and roared into the empty silent night.

“Show yourself, mongrel!"" 

His laughter never seemed to cease. It stood in place of a physical person. Almost attaining its own physicality.

“You hurl insults because you've nothing else to throw! Nothing else to attack! You are hilarious, German! I've always liked you but you should not be so easy, not after all this time, no?"" 

He had to be careful. The sorcerer was dangerous. He could bend and weave reality seemingly at will, like a djin. None of his brotherhood nor the high priest could discern his source of power. Nor its limits. 

“I insult you, witch, because you and your kind are garbage."" 

Laughter that became a cacophonous crack! It dominated the world, the soundtrack hell to the neon witching scene. The music somehow came to life and began to play again, a wicked untethered horde flurry series of scaling and wild notes in wild man tandem with the laughter of the sorcerer, a corruption duet.

A ney. The headhunter remembers what it is that the instrument is called. A ney. 

Its sound and the sorcerer's laughter were a whirlwind maelstrom expansion sound swell within his skull. For a moment he considered taking his own blade and driving it into his own face, bashing it in and freeing that which was trapped within and growing, threatening to burst like the milk of green infection.

He stopped himself at the last moment. His training saving him. He recognized what was happening, what it was…

… bewitchment. 

He regained his focus against the tumult wave of sound storm wielded by the sorcerer, who once again cried out from nowhere. 

“Garbage! We are all garbage for the earth, German. We are all meat detritus for the watering jaws of the starving soil, we all return to it, are all reduced to ruin and returned to the sour womb to feed the indifferent planet. You know! You know! Only our petty Gods care! And so they fight! And, we, their moving pieces!”

And with that, the pieces did move. 

 Hand of Iblis. The mad sorcerer. 

Against champion of the goat-shape, Azræl.

And this modern Sodom of steel and human woe was to be the chess board for their latest match. A contest of secret champions. 

He did not see, but felt… 

Behind him. Movement. Killing stance. 

The headhunter whirled round with sudden animal speed in a counter slash. Roaring. 

But he roared… and slashed… at nothing. 

Nothing there. Only thin night air. 

Laughter/voice. Behind him again. 

“The same tricks always work on all of you."" 

He whirled once more. Nothing. 

The laughter again. Across the street. 

Azræl drew throwing dagger and with a lunge and a flick/turn of the forearm and wrist, threw the quivering blade. 

It struck pavement next to a dying drunk in a splatter burst of caveman fire spray. Grabby yelped. But there was no sorcerer of the sands over there. 

Or anywhere. 

Goddamit. 

""Up here.”

The headhunter whirled once more, a dancer upon my stage thought the sorcerer but kept it to himself. The German would not appreciate such an observation. 

""Why do you hide in a tree?” asked the black knight of the goat-shape order impetiously. 

The sorcerer grinned, balanced on the branch of a starving sapling oak. Running alongside a dark and quiet apartment building. 

""I've always appreciated a wider view, German. Always. Up here, I see more and I am closer to heaven and therefore I can see more like God. You… and your brothers… you stay down there in the dirt because you cannot know anything more."" 

Azræl raised blade. 

“Come down here and show me what I know, mongrel. Perhaps I can show you a thing or two as well."" 

The sorcerer shrugged. 

“Eh."" 

Azræl drew once more and threw. The throwing blade of ornate seven pointed star flew unabated, cutting through the nighttime chill like a deadly bird of sharpened stabbing steel. 

But when the piercing blade found the place in the tree where the heart of the sorcerer was, it no longer was there. 

It never had been. 

""I'm always behind you, German.” 

He spun on his booted heels and his great arms carried his tireless steel down in another great chop. But it was already too late. 

The sorcerer raised the ney and blocked the blow as if the wind instrument was an iron bar. He then flew in, swift movement that was not at all human or natural, stepping in close and bringing the long cylindrical body of the instrument down in a cracking blow across the headhunter's crown, splitting it and knocking consciousness from his mind's failing grip. 

But as he sent the headhunter's mind on a journey into darkness, he gave it another vision. A vision of flames. 

…

Jerusalem. 

Burning Jerusalem. 

where will you turn when it all goes wrong…?

The holy city is a cinder shrieking thousands as one. The holy city is in flames. 

… and you're on the run

And all around the city is a newly erected manmade hellscape forest grove. All around the city are the impaling lancing sticks. On them are the impaled. All of them are still screaming, screaming with their burning city. Man. Woman. Child. Animal. The warriors that have done this like to crucify lions for fun but for now, this will suffice. The people of the Lord's precious city will make satisfactory sport. 

And they do. As the forest of the impaled. All of them beg for death, they are the only words left, the only ones they can remember now in the throes of this special agony. Thousands upon thousands of shrieking lanced through but still living souls. Bodies skewered every which way, up through the groin, behind the genitals, upside down and through the tissue of the back, up the ass, gravity pulls savagely as if hungry and they slowly sink lower and lower along the stabbing spire body of the impaling lances as the time drags by with sadistic cruelty. The sheer heart attack torture of the sensations of tearing and rupture and bodily invasion and ruin as all and one horrible coalescence is all that any of them are capable of knowing in their last drawn out hours. For many it is days. 

And beside the forest of the impaled and all of its mindless shrieking, the burning city. 

Jerusalem. 

…

When the headhunter returned from darkness he was lying alone in the street. 

He sat up quickly, Panicked! 

His great sword was still clutched tightly. 

But when he looked around, the drunk that had been watching them was dead now. Blood foamed from his eyes and mouth like a hot porridge stew of thick sudsy pink. 

Worse yet, the sorcerer was gone. 

Worse than that, so were the heads. 

So was his offering…

Goddamit.

Was standing with my friend after a talk; he was speaking to a lecturer, then she approaches out of the corner of my eye, stands very close to me (elbows almost touching) and we both stand in silence for 2 mins waiting for the lecturer to be ready. She checks her phone briefly but apart from that we just stand there. She’s very bubbly and chatty, nearly always see her talking to people; not sure what to make of the silence. 

When the lecturer starts talking to us, she is chatty again, but only makes eye contact with the lecturer and my friend, despite being closest to me and having space to move into ahead of her to get closer to the lecturer.

I leave with my friend, she goes back to the classroom to get her bag. Tell my friend I’m gonna go study in the lab; while we’re talking, she passes us out heading through the corridor. When I say goodbye to my friend, she’s turned around and smiles quite sheepishly saying that she thinks she’s left her coffee at home and is gonna check the classroom, but that she’ll see me in the lab (I only told my friend I was going to the lab). She said this part more confidently than the coffee part. 

In the lab, I sit down, 30 seconds later she comes up smiling, no coffee, on my side of the room despite an empty lab. I say “that’s devastating” jokingly, ask why she can’t order one in the cafe and she says she has to have oat milk. I say “oh you’re one of THOSE”, she chuckles, sits down on the chair behind me (her back now to me), and we both study. When I get up, she (with no earphones) looks up and says bye before I do.

What do you make of this? I did sense some possible interest but she is very bubbly and social; never really assumed she’d like me. I thought she would talk to me more overall if she was interested? ",1,1771331942.0,Crush,0,1.0,False

The maggot struggled to speak and beg as the headhunter raised his great blade above his head. Readying to strike. 

“Not at all for you or yourself. Swear to her. Pray to me.” said Azræl as he brought the blade down and cleaved the head free from the rest of the meat. It tumble-jumped with a ropey-cord tail of thick black red that the stump continued to produce and shoot in dark gouts for a moment before the headless body collapsed to the street. 

And then the night was quiet again. All around.  Lights buzzed and mock heaven glowed. 

The peace was relative, conditionary. You could still hear the ghost song of sirens in the distance. Wailing away in flight, in search, in search of anything. 

Azræl picked up the head and said his prayers to the goat-shaped lord of his house and order. He tied it to the belt of his hulking black leather visage to join two others and went on his way. 

The sorcerer watched. The sorcerer was impressed. 

…

He heaved. Spewed. Decorated the sidewalk and gutter in more bile, blood and stomach lining as another sharp stab in his stomach racked his guts and his convulsion threatened to roll over into a seizing tear in his brain. 

Homeless and well past his last leg, Elton prayed for death as his sickened body worsened on the pavement, alone at the bus stop. Underneath the flickering glow of a dying bulb, a failing light. 

It was not death he received but something more spectacular. Elton, Grabby to his friends and scum and fellow urchins of the street, was made audience and thus unwitting chronicler to a chapter in a shadow conflict centuries upon centuries old, perhaps the oldest conflict in all of man's time. Perhaps even older than that. 

Grabby/Elton looked up from his own bloody spew of booze and lining and watched a giant titan walk into view. Destroying his solitude on this witching houred boulevard. 

He knew he must be fucked. The guy looked massive and he looked like Mad Max or the Terminator or someone like that and he looked like he was carrying a huge fucking sword. 

And along his belt were a buncha fuckin heads…

No fucking way. The dying urchin refused it. No fuckin way am I actually seein that fuckin thing. 

But real or not, the giant of myth and flesh and chained leather continued to march up and then past the druggie’s view, crossing to and then down the opposite side of the street. 

But then something made the headhunter stop. 

Elton heard it too. 

A note.  Notes. Music. 

A wind pattern series flurry of intricate and delicate notes whispered and alternate sharp-stab blasted through the nighttime witching air. Filling it. Dominating the scene. 

Azræl tensed cat-like coiled as his hair stood on end. The music was flute-like. Middle Eastern flavored…

Goddamit. No.

The headhunter was filled with dread. 

The music stopped. An ancient voice, bold, cut through the night. 

“How are you, German? Been long time."" 

His stance shifted to battle ready as his blade came up raised. His voice, louder, cut through the night as well to the speaker unseen. But he knew who it was to whom he spoke. 

""What do you want, snake?”

Laughter. Real. The knight Azræl always was good for a laugh as far the sorcerer was concerned.

“So funny?"" Azræl said to the night all around him. “Come out and show me what's so funny, witch."" 

More laughter. 

“Have we not shared many things over the long years, my friend? Such a long time. A great deal.”

A series of images flicker-shot through the headhunter's mind then. Whether put there by the devilry of the sorcerer or memories of his own from one of many possible past lives, Azræl was not sure. If he lived through this encounter he would meditate and pray on the matter later. 

If he lived through this encounter. 

His mind's eye:

The forests and the forest people and their villages are burning. There is much bloodletting. The ground is gorged, it cannot possibly drink up all of it. It sloshes about the ankles of the soldiering and the marching and the frantic frightened running. The pursuers too. The blood that chokes the earth sloshes mire-like about the furnace steps of them all. Charlemagne has demanded these pagan northmen be put to kneel before the cross or be put to the sword. Slavery for their women and children…

… and the knights were thus dispatched thither…

The headhunter severed the line of thought or memory or whatever it was with brutal sudden cunning and roared into the empty silent night.

“Show yourself, mongrel!"" 

His laughter never seemed to cease. It stood in place of a physical person. Almost attaining its own physicality.

“You hurl insults because you've nothing else to throw! Nothing else to attack! You are hilarious, German! I've always liked you but you should not be so easy, not after all this time, no?"" 

He had to be careful. The sorcerer was dangerous. He could bend and weave reality seemingly at will, like a djin. None of his brotherhood nor the high priest could discern his source of power. Nor its limits. 

“I insult you, witch, because you and your kind are garbage."" 

Laughter that became a cacophonous crack! It dominated the world, the soundtrack hell to the neon witching scene. The music somehow came to life and began to play again, a wicked untethered horde flurry series of scaling and wild notes in wild man tandem with the laughter of the sorcerer, a corruption duet.

A ney. The headhunter remembers what it is that the instrument is called. A ney. 

Its sound and the sorcerer's laughter were a whirlwind maelstrom expansion sound swell within his skull. For a moment he considered taking his own blade and driving it into his own face, bashing it in and freeing that which was trapped within and growing, threatening to burst like the milk of green infection.

He stopped himself at the last moment. His training saving him. He recognized what was happening, what it was…

… bewitchment. 

He regained his focus against the tumult wave of sound storm wielded by the sorcerer, who once again cried out from nowhere. 

“Garbage! We are all garbage for the earth, German. We are all meat detritus for the watering jaws of the starving soil, we all return to it, are all reduced to ruin and returned to the sour womb to feed the indifferent planet. You know! You know! Only our petty Gods care! And so they fight! And, we, their moving pieces!”

And with that, the pieces did move. 

 Hand of Iblis. The mad sorcerer. 

Against champion of the goat-shape, Azræl.

And this modern Sodom of steel and human woe was to be the chess board for their latest match. A contest of secret champions. 

He did not see, but felt… 

Behind him. Movement. Killing stance. 

The headhunter whirled round with sudden animal speed in a counter slash. Roaring. 

But he roared… and slashed… at nothing. 

Nothing there. Only thin night air. 

Laughter/voice. Behind him again. 

“The same tricks always work on all of you."" 

He whirled once more. Nothing. 

The laughter again. Across the street. 

Azræl drew throwing dagger and with a lunge and a flick/turn of the forearm and wrist, threw the quivering blade. 

It struck pavement next to a dying drunk in a splatter burst of caveman fire spray. Grabby yelped. But there was no sorcerer of the sands over there. 

Or anywhere. 

Goddamit. 

""Up here.”

The headhunter whirled once more, a dancer upon my stage thought the sorcerer but kept it to himself. The German would not appreciate such an observation. 

""Why do you hide in a tree?” asked the black knight of the goat-shape order impetiously. 

The sorcerer grinned, balanced on the branch of a starving sapling oak. Running alongside a dark and quiet apartment building. 

""I've always appreciated a wider view, German. Always. Up here, I see more and I am closer to heaven and therefore I can see more like God. You… and your brothers… you stay down there in the dirt because you cannot know anything more."" 

Azræl raised blade. 

“Come down here and show me what I know, mongrel. Perhaps I can show you a thing or two as well."" 

The sorcerer shrugged. 

“Eh."" 

Azræl drew once more and threw. The throwing blade of ornate seven pointed star flew unabated, cutting through the nighttime chill like a deadly bird of sharpened stabbing steel. 

But when the piercing blade found the place in the tree where the heart of the sorcerer was, it no longer was there. 

It never had been. 

""I'm always behind you, German.” 

He spun on his booted heels and his great arms carried his tireless steel down in another great chop. But it was already too late. 

The sorcerer raised the ney and blocked the blow as if the wind instrument was an iron bar. He then flew in, swift movement that was not at all human or natural, stepping in close and bringing the long cylindrical body of the instrument down in a cracking blow across the headhunter's crown, splitting it and knocking consciousness from his mind's failing grip. 

But as he sent the headhunter's mind on a journey into darkness, he gave it another vision. A vision of flames. 

…

Jerusalem. 

Burning Jerusalem. 

where will you turn when it all goes wrong…?

The holy city is a cinder shrieking thousands as one. The holy city is in flames. 

… and you're on the run

And all around the city is a newly erected manmade hellscape forest grove. All around the city are the impaling lancing sticks. On them are the impaled. All of them are still screaming, screaming with their burning city. Man. Woman. Child. Animal. The warriors that have done this like to crucify lions for fun but for now, this will suffice. The people of the Lord's precious city will make satisfactory sport. 

And they do. As the forest of the impaled. All of them beg for death, they are the only words left, the only ones they can remember now in the throes of this special agony. Thousands upon thousands of shrieking lanced through but still living souls. Bodies skewered every which way, up through the groin, behind the genitals, upside down and through the tissue of the back, up the ass, gravity pulls savagely as if hungry and they slowly sink lower and lower along the stabbing spire body of the impaling lances as the time drags by with sadistic cruelty. The sheer heart attack torture of the sensations of tearing and rupture and bodily invasion and ruin as all and one horrible coalescence is all that any of them are capable of knowing in their last drawn out hours. For many it is days. 

And beside the forest of the impaled and all of its mindless shrieking, the burning city. 

Jerusalem. 

…

When the headhunter returned from darkness he was lying alone in the street. 

He sat up quickly, Panicked! 

His great sword was still clutched tightly. 

But when he looked around, the drunk that had been watching them was dead now. Blood foamed from his eyes and mouth like a hot porridge stew of thick sudsy pink. 

Worse yet, the sorcerer was gone. 

Worse than that, so were the heads. 

So was his offering…

Goddamit.

The Nazis were right. You are a degenerate species…

It was all of it a swollen pustule sac. A land of green milk and curdled cheese, cockroaches swam in the stew of discharge and mire and laughably called it a metropolitan. A cultural hub. 

A blade of a smile formed amongst a tumult of dark and ageless hair, a wizard's haggard beard. Blasted by sand and sun just like the rest of the white robed man. White robed death. 

Some say he is the mad author of the Necronomicon. He has authored the destruction of countless cities, countless places… before this one. 

Jericho. Troy. Münster. Constantinople. Alexandria. Roanoke. Ikeshima. Rome. 

And many others… great and small. He doesn't care. He only loved to watch as the red hand of Iblis crawled across the blackening surface of all things dying in its embrace, turning the whole of the world into its killing floor. 

But that wasn't all with this place. No. He was sent here not just to burn but to gather intelligence for the order. 

And to contest. 

…

Homicide was scrambling. They had nothing. What commonalities they did find between the victims was interesting… but it only led to more bafflement. More flummoxed minds in the busying police departments all across the city. All bullshit pretension had been dropped, all departments across all counties and neighborhoods were working together on this one, to bring the crazy fucking bastard in. 

But still they had nothing. Except that he liked to chop off heads. And leave them at churches for some fucking reason. 

And one other thing. One oddity that more than a few of the sharper minds amongst the rank and file of criminal investigators found to be interesting. 

But did it mean anything? 

All of them. Every head found belonged to someone with a rap sheet that read more like a tome. Miles long some of em. Each and every one of em had a history. 

Mob hits! that was the popular running theory around the suits and their steaming white paper cups of coffee. 

It wasn't a bad one, most thought. 

Could be. Could be.

…

Azræl leapt from the dark and charged into the man as he was making his way to his car. Slamming him into the driver's door as he tried to open it and catching him by surprise.

His hand, clenched tightly round the hilt of his great sword came up and bashed the maggot across the mouth with the metal pommel of the weapon. A crack, and a splurt of hot blood and teeth out the mouth and the maggot went down to his knees, mewling.

The maggot struggled to speak and beg as the headhunter raised his great blade above his head. Readying to strike. 

“Not at all for you or yourself. Swear to her. Pray to me.” said Azræl as he brought the blade down and cleaved the head free from the rest of the meat.

Elton, Grabby to his friends and scum and fellow urchins of the street, was made audience and thus unwitting chronicler to a chapter in a shadow conflict centuries upon centuries old, perhaps the oldest conflict in all of man's time. Perhaps even older than that. 

Grabby/Elton looked up from his own bloody spew of booze and lining and watched a giant titan walk into view. Destroying his solitude on this witching houred boulevard. 

He knew he must be fucked. The guy looked massive and he looked like Mad Max or the Terminator or someone like that and he looked like he was carrying a huge fucking sword. 

And along his belt were a buncha fuckin heads…

No fucking way. The dying urchin refused it. No fuckin way am I actually seein that fuckin thing. 

But real or not, the giant of myth and flesh and chained leather continued to march up and then past the druggie’s view, crossing to and then down the opposite side of the street. 

But then something made the headhunter stop. 

Elton heard it too. 

A note.  Notes. Music. 

A wind pattern series flurry of intricate and delicate notes whispered and alternate sharp-stab blasted through the nighttime witching air. Filling it. Dominating the scene. 

Azræl tensed cat-like coiled as his hair stood on end. The music was flute-like. Middle Eastern flavored…

Goddamit. No.

The headhunter was filled with dread. 

The music stopped. An ancient voice, bold, cut through the night. 

“How are you, German? Been long time."" 

His stance shifted to battle ready as his blade came up raised. His voice, louder, cut through the night as well to the speaker unseen. But he knew who it was to whom he spoke. 

""What do you want, snake?”

Laughter. Real. The knight Azræl always was good for a laugh as far the sorcerer was concerned.

“So funny?"" Azræl said to the night all around him. “Come out and show me what's so funny, witch."" 

More laughter. 

“Have we not shared many things over the long years, my friend? Such a long time. A great deal.”

A series of images flicker-shot through the headhunter's mind then. Whether put there by the devilry of the sorcerer or memories of his own from one of many possible past lives, Azræl was not sure. If he lived through this encounter he would meditate and pray on the matter later. 

If he lived through this encounter. 

His mind's eye:

The forests and the forest people and their villages are burning. There is much bloodletting. The ground is gorged, it cannot possibly drink up all of it. It sloshes about the ankles of the soldiering and the marching and the frantic frightened running. The pursuers too. The blood that chokes the earth sloshes mire-like about the furnace steps of them all. Charlemagne has demanded these pagan northmen be put to kneel before the cross or be put to the sword. Slavery for their women and children…

… and the knights were thus dispatched thither…

The headhunter severed the line of thought or memory or whatever it was with brutal sudden cunning and roared into the empty silent night.

“Show yourself, mongrel!"" 

His laughter never seemed to cease. It stood in place of a physical person. Almost attaining its own physicality.

“You hurl insults because you've nothing else to throw! Nothing else to attack! You are hilarious, German! I've always liked you but you should not be so easy, not after all this time, no?"" 

He had to be careful. The sorcerer was dangerous. He could bend and weave reality seemingly at will, like a djin. None of his brotherhood nor the high priest could discern his source of power. Nor its limits. 

“I insult you, witch, because you and your kind are garbage."" 

Laughter that became a cacophonous crack! It dominated the world, the soundtrack hell to the neon witching scene. The music somehow came to life and began to play again, a wicked untethered horde flurry series of scaling and wild notes in wild man tandem with the laughter of the sorcerer, a corruption duet.

A ney. The headhunter remembers what it is that the instrument is called. A ney. 

Its sound and the sorcerer's laughter were a whirlwind maelstrom expansion sound swell within his skull. For a moment he considered taking his own blade and driving it into his own face, bashing it in and freeing that which was trapped within and growing, threatening to burst like the milk of green infection.

He stopped himself at the last moment. His training saving him. He recognized what was happening, what it was…

… bewitchment. 

He regained his focus against the tumult wave of sound storm wielded by the sorcerer, who once again cried out from nowhere. 

“Garbage! We are all garbage for the earth, German. We are all meat detritus for the watering jaws of the starving soil, we all return to it, are all reduced to ruin and returned to the sour womb to feed the indifferent planet. You know! You know! Only our petty Gods care! And so they fight! And, we, their moving pieces!”

And with that, the pieces did move. 

 Hand of Iblis. The mad sorcerer. 

Against champion of the goat-shape, Azræl.

And this modern Sodom of steel and human woe was to be the chess board for their latest match. A contest of secret champions. 

He did not see, but felt… 

Behind him. Movement. Killing stance. 

The headhunter whirled round with sudden animal speed in a counter slash. Roaring. 

But he roared… and slashed… at nothing. 

Nothing there. Only thin night air. 

Laughter/voice. Behind him again. 

“The same tricks always work on all of you."" 

He whirled once more. Nothing. 

The laughter again. Across the street. 

Azræl drew throwing dagger and with a lunge and a flick/turn of the forearm and wrist, threw the quivering blade. 

It struck pavement next to a dying drunk in a splatter burst of caveman fire spray. Grabby yelped. But there was no sorcerer of the sands over there. 

Or anywhere. 

Goddamit. 

""Up here.”

The headhunter whirled once more, a dancer upon my stage thought the sorcerer but kept it to himself. The German would not appreciate such an observation. 

""Why do you hide in a tree?” asked the black knight of the goat-shape order impetiously. 

The sorcerer grinned, balanced on the branch of a starving sapling oak. Running alongside a dark and quiet apartment building. 

""I've always appreciated a wider view, German. Always. Up here, I see more and I am closer to heaven and therefore I can see more like God. You… and your brothers… you stay down there in the dirt because you cannot know anything more."" 

Azræl raised blade. 

“Come down here and show me what I know, mongrel. Perhaps I can show you a thing or two as well."" 

The sorcerer shrugged. 

“Eh."" 

Azræl drew once more and threw. The throwing blade of ornate seven pointed star flew unabated, cutting through the nighttime chill like a deadly bird of sharpened stabbing steel. 

But when the piercing blade found the place in the tree where the heart of the sorcerer was, it no longer was there. 

It never had been. 

""I'm always behind you, German.” 

He spun on his booted heels and his great arms carried his tireless steel down in another great chop. But it was already too late. 

The sorcerer raised the ney and blocked the blow as if the wind instrument was an iron bar. He then flew in, swift movement that was not at all human or natural, stepping in close and bringing the long cylindrical body of the instrument down in a cracking blow across the headhunter's crown, splitting it and knocking consciousness from his mind's failing grip. 

But as he sent the headhunter's mind on a journey into darkness, he gave it another vision. A vision of flames. 

…

Jerusalem. 

Burning Jerusalem. 

where will you turn when it all goes wrong…?

The holy city is a cinder shrieking thousands as one. The holy city is in flames. 

… and you're on the run

And all around the city is a newly erected manmade hellscape forest grove. All around the city are the impaling lancing sticks. On them are the impaled. All of them are still screaming, screaming with their burning city. Man. Woman. Child. Animal. The warriors that have done this like to crucify lions for fun but for now, this will suffice. The people of the Lord's precious city will make satisfactory sport. 

And they do. As the forest of the impaled. All of them beg for death, they are the only words left, the only ones they can remember now in the throes of this special agony. Thousands upon thousands of shrieking lanced through but still living souls. Bodies skewered every which way, up through the groin, behind the genitals, upside down and through the tissue of the back, up the ass, gravity pulls savagely as if hungry and they slowly sink lower and lower along the stabbing spire body of the impaling lances as the time drags by with sadistic cruelty. The sheer heart attack torture of the sensations of tearing and rupture and bodily invasion and ruin as all and one horrible coalescence is all that any of them are capable of knowing in their last drawn out hours. For many it is days. 

And beside the forest of the impaled and all of its mindless shrieking, the burning city. 

Jerusalem. 

…

When the headhunter returned from darkness he was lying alone in the street. 

He sat up quickly, Panicked! 

His great sword was still clutched tightly. 

But when he looked around, the drunk that had been watching them was dead now. Blood foamed from his eyes and mouth like a hot porridge stew of thick sudsy pink. 

Worse yet, the sorcerer was gone. 

Worse than that, so were the heads. 

So was his offering…

Goddamit.

1r74smh,https://www.reddit.com/r/podcasts/comments/1r74smh/pick_one_true_crime_podcast_they_all_cover_the/,"""Pick one true crime podcast, they all cover the same stuff."" I transcribed 220 episodes to check. That's not what I found.","I transcribed 220 episodes from 11 true crime podcasts (every episode published in the last 30 days) and mapped every criminal case mentioned. I wanted to see exactly how bad the redundancy problem has become in the genre.

I built an overlap matrix, and the Brendan Banfield murder trial was the massive outlier. It showed up in **43 episodes** across Court TV, Nancy Grace, 48 Hours, and Dateline.

That looked like a redundancy nightmare. So, I went back and read the transcripts for all of them closely.

The result? They are barely telling the same story.

Here is the breakdown of what each show covered (and what the others missed):

**48 Hours: The ""Why""**  
They recorded one episode after the verdict. Two journalists talk through the case like colleagues having coffee.

* **Unique Detail:** They pinpointed the exact moment the defense fell apart: a premature 911 call that didn't match the timeline.
* **The Vibe:** They were the only show to spend the final minutes discussing Christine as a person - who she was and what her daughter lost.

**Nancy Grace: The Forensics (and the yelling)**  
She ran two episodes. One was a forensic walkthrough; the other was classic Nancy shouting. But if you stripped away the noise, she had the biggest scoop.

* **Unique Detail:** She was the only one to mention the **triple-glazed windows**. The killer installed soundproof glass and tested it by having his lover scream upstairs while he stood outside to ensure neighbors couldn't hear.
* **The Vibe:** High information density masked by theatrics.

**Court TV: The Sportscast**  
They treated the trial like a sporting event. 37 episodes across five sub-shows.

* **Unique Detail:** A body language expert (Janine Driver) sat three rows behind the defendant's father and took 27 pages of notes. She identified ""temporal distancing"" in his testimony - specifically how he used the phrase ""at that point"" over 50 times to psychologically separate himself from the stabbing.
* **The Vibe:** Pure strategy. Zero narrative.

**Dateline: The Slow Burn**  
Covered across three weekly roundups.

* **The Vibe:** It was a slow escalation from a 40-line mention in Week 1 to the lead story in Week 3. Good for suspense, but they weirdly kept referring to the male victim as ""a stranger"" long after his identity was known.

**The ""Zero Overlap"" Surprise**  
Here is the part that actually shocked me: The storytelling podcasts had **zero overlap**.

I tracked Criminal, Crime Junkie, Casefile, Generation Why, Rotten Mango, and Sword and Scale. They produced 43 episodes covering 39 unique cases in the same 30-day window. Not a single shared story between them.

**My Takeaway:**  
If you listen to ""News"" pods (Dateline/Court TV), you aren't getting the same story - you're getting a specific lens (Legal vs. Forensic vs. Emotional). If you listen to ""Storytelling"" pods, the redundancy problem basically doesn't exist.

Has anyone else noticed this? I always assumed the big shows were just copy-pasting each other, but the ""lens"" seems to matter way more than the facts.",2,1771331596.0,podcasts,0,1.0,False

The Nazis were right. You are a degenerate species…

It was all of it a swollen pustule sac. A land of green milk and curdled cheese, cockroaches swam in the stew of discharge and mire and laughably called it a metropolitan. A cultural hub. 

A blade of a smile formed amongst a tumult of dark and ageless hair, a wizard's haggard beard. Blasted by sand and sun just like the rest of the white robed man. White robed death. 

Some say he is the mad author of the Necronomicon. He has authored the destruction of countless cities, countless places… before this one. 

Jericho. Troy. Münster. Constantinople. Alexandria. Roanoke. Ikeshima. Rome. 

And many others… great and small. He doesn't care. He only loved to watch as the red hand of Iblis crawled across the blackening surface of all things dying in its embrace, turning the whole of the world into its killing floor. 

But that wasn't all with this place. No. He was sent here not just to burn but to gather intelligence for the order. 

And to contest. 

…

Homicide was scrambling. They had nothing. What commonalities they did find between the victims was interesting… but it only led to more bafflement. More flummoxed minds in the busying police departments all across the city. All bullshit pretension had been dropped, all departments across all counties and neighborhoods were working together on this one, to bring the crazy fucking bastard in. 

But still they had nothing. Except that he liked to chop off heads. And leave them at churches for some fucking reason. 

And one other thing. One oddity that more than a few of the sharper minds amongst the rank and file of criminal investigators found to be interesting. 

But did it mean anything? 

All of them. Every head found belonged to someone with a rap sheet that read more like a tome. Miles long some of em. Each and every one of em had a history. 

Mob hits! that was the popular running theory around the suits and their steaming white paper cups of coffee. 

It wasn't a bad one, most thought. 

Could be. Could be.

…

Azræl leapt from the dark and charged into the man as he was making his way to his car. Slamming him into the driver's door as he tried to open it and catching him by surprise. 

This was the one. This was one of the faces the goat-shape demanded be brought before her feet. 

His hand, clenched tightly round the hilt of his great sword came up and bashed the maggot across the mouth with the metal pommel of the weapon. A crack, and a splurt of hot blood and teeth out the mouth and the maggot went down to his knees, mewling. 

Where he belonged. 

The maggot struggled to speak and beg as the headhunter raised his great blade above his head. Readying to strike. 

“Not at all for you or yourself. Swear to her. Pray to me.” said Azræl as he brought the blade down and cleaved the head free from the rest of the meat. It tumble-jumped with a ropey-cord tail of thick black red that the stump continued to produce and shoot in dark gouts for a moment before the headless body collapsed to the street. 

And then the night was quiet again. All around.  Lights buzzed and mock heaven glowed. 

The peace was relative, conditionary. You could still hear the ghost song of sirens in the distance. Wailing away in flight, in search, in search of anything. 

Azræl picked up the head and said his prayers to the goat-shaped lord of his house and order. He tied it to the belt of his hulking black leather visage to join two others and went on his way. 

The sorcerer watched. The sorcerer was impressed. 

…

He heaved. Spewed. Decorated the sidewalk and gutter in more bile, blood and stomach lining as another sharp stab in his stomach racked his guts and his convulsion threatened to roll over into a seizing tear in his brain. 

Homeless and well past his last leg, Elton prayed for death as his sickened body worsened on the pavement, alone at the bus stop. Underneath the flickering glow of a dying bulb, a failing light.

Any insight of advice?,"My boyfriend and I have been dating for quite some time now. We moved in together at the end of 2025 and plan to get married in the near future. As our relationship has grown more serious, I have noticed an increase in passive aggressive comments and underlying resentment from my future father-in-law. 

The most recent (and most severe) example of this happened a couple weeks ago while we were all out on a walk with my future sister-in-laws newborn baby. I was taking my turn to push the pram when he blatantly stated that I wouldn't make a good mother one day (I don't even remember his exact words - I think I blacked out). My BF was stunned by this and said something like ""why would you say that?"", to which my FIL said it was just a joke. The whole family seems pretty put off by this though, and we left pretty soon after. The comment was incredibly hurtful since my BF and I are really looking forward to starting our own family one day, and everyone knows that. Pretty much the whole family was upset with him over this, with my BF's sister and her husband telling him to apologise to me. Apparently my BF's mom was also on the verge of tears about what he said. He called my BF a couple days later to ask if the two of us could meet him for coffee, which we did and he then apologised to me. I could tell that he genuinely wishes he didn't say it, but I don't think it because it hurt my feelings. I don't know... he's not a bad guy and I used to get on really well with him before I started dating his son. 

I just don't know where this is all coming from. I also feel myself growing a distaste for him in response to the way he treats me, and I don't want that. My BF has a very tight-knit family and they mean a lot to him. I don't want to be the one to come in and cause disruption and drama. Why can't it be like it was when we first started dating?

The maggot struggled to speak and beg as the headhunter raised his great blade above his head. Readying to strike. 

“Not at all for you or yourself. Swear to her. Pray to me.” said Azræl as he brought the blade down and cleaved the head free from the rest of the meat. It tumble-jumped with a ropey-cord tail of thick black red that the stump continued to produce and shoot in dark gouts for a moment before the headless body collapsed to the street. 

And then the night was quiet again. All around.  Lights buzzed and mock heaven glowed. 

The peace was relative, conditionary. You could still hear the ghost song of sirens in the distance. Wailing away in flight, in search, in search of anything. 

Azræl picked up the head and said his prayers to the goat-shaped lord of his house and order. He tied it to the belt of his hulking black leather visage to join two others and went on his way. 

The sorcerer watched. The sorcerer was impressed. 

…

He heaved. Spewed. Decorated the sidewalk and gutter in more bile, blood and stomach lining as another sharp stab in his stomach racked his guts and his convulsion threatened to roll over into a seizing tear in his brain. 

Homeless and well past his last leg, Elton prayed for death as his sickened body worsened on the pavement, alone at the bus stop. Underneath the flickering glow of a dying bulb, a failing light. 

It was not death he received but something more spectacular. Elton, Grabby to his friends and scum and fellow urchins of the street, was made audience and thus unwitting chronicler to a chapter in a shadow conflict centuries upon centuries old, perhaps the oldest conflict in all of man's time. Perhaps even older than that. 

Grabby/Elton looked up from his own bloody spew of booze and lining and watched a giant titan walk into view. Destroying his solitude on this witching houred boulevard. 

He knew he must be fucked. The guy looked massive and he looked like Mad Max or the Terminator or someone like that and he looked like he was carrying a huge fucking sword. 

And along his belt were a buncha fuckin heads…

No fucking way. The dying urchin refused it. No fuckin way am I actually seein that fuckin thing. 

But real or not, the giant of myth and flesh and chained leather continued to march up and then past the druggie’s view, crossing to and then down the opposite side of the street. 

But then something made the headhunter stop. 

Elton heard it too. 

A note.  Notes. Music. 

A wind pattern series flurry of intricate and delicate notes whispered and alternate sharp-stab blasted through the nighttime witching air. Filling it. Dominating the scene. 

Azræl tensed cat-like coiled as his hair stood on end. The music was flute-like. Middle Eastern flavored…

Goddamit. No.

The headhunter was filled with dread. 

The music stopped. An ancient voice, bold, cut through the night. 

“How are you, German? Been long time."" 

His stance shifted to battle ready as his blade came up raised. His voice, louder, cut through the night as well to the speaker unseen. But he knew who it was to whom he spoke. 

""What do you want, snake?”

Laughter. Real. The knight Azræl always was good for a laugh as far the sorcerer was concerned.

“So funny?"" Azræl said to the night all around him. “Come out and show me what's so funny, witch."" 

More laughter. 

“Have we not shared many things over the long years, my friend? Such a long time. A great deal.”

A series of images flicker-shot through the headhunter's mind then. Whether put there by the devilry of the sorcerer or memories of his own from one of many possible past lives, Azræl was not sure. If he lived through this encounter he would meditate and pray on the matter later. 

If he lived through this encounter. 

His mind's eye:

The forests and the forest people and their villages are burning. There is much bloodletting. The ground is gorged, it cannot possibly drink up all of it. It sloshes about the ankles of the soldiering and the marching and the frantic frightened running. The pursuers too. The blood that chokes the earth sloshes mire-like about the furnace steps of them all. Charlemagne has demanded these pagan northmen be put to kneel before the cross or be put to the sword. Slavery for their women and children…

… and the knights were thus dispatched thither…

The headhunter severed the line of thought or memory or whatever it was with brutal sudden cunning and roared into the empty silent night.

“Show yourself, mongrel!"" 

His laughter never seemed to cease. It stood in place of a physical person. Almost attaining its own physicality.

“You hurl insults because you've nothing else to throw! Nothing else to attack! You are hilarious, German! I've always liked you but you should not be so easy, not after all this time, no?"" 

He had to be careful. The sorcerer was dangerous. He could bend and weave reality seemingly at will, like a djin. None of his brotherhood nor the high priest could discern his source of power. Nor its limits. 

“I insult you, witch, because you and your kind are garbage."" 

Laughter that became a cacophonous crack! It dominated the world, the soundtrack hell to the neon witching scene. The music somehow came to life and began to play again, a wicked untethered horde flurry series of scaling and wild notes in wild man tandem with the laughter of the sorcerer, a corruption duet.

A ney. The headhunter remembers what it is that the instrument is called. A ney. 

Its sound and the sorcerer's laughter were a whirlwind maelstrom expansion sound swell within his skull. For a moment he considered taking his own blade and driving it into his own face, bashing it in and freeing that which was trapped within and growing, threatening to burst like the milk of green infection.

He stopped himself at the last moment. His training saving him. He recognized what was happening, what it was…

… bewitchment. 

He regained his focus against the tumult wave of sound storm wielded by the sorcerer, who once again cried out from nowhere. 

“Garbage! We are all garbage for the earth, German. We are all meat detritus for the watering jaws of the starving soil, we all return to it, are all reduced to ruin and returned to the sour womb to feed the indifferent planet. You know! You know! Only our petty Gods care! And so they fight! And, we, their moving pieces!”

And with that, the pieces did move. 

 Hand of Iblis. The mad sorcerer. 

Against champion of the goat-shape, Azræl.

And this modern Sodom of steel and human woe was to be the chess board for their latest match. A contest of secret champions. 

He did not see, but felt… 

Behind him. Movement. Killing stance. 

The headhunter whirled round with sudden animal speed in a counter slash. Roaring. 

But he roared… and slashed… at nothing. 

Nothing there. Only thin night air. 

Laughter/voice. Behind him again. 

“The same tricks always work on all of you."" 

He whirled once more. Nothing. 

The laughter again. Across the street. 

Azræl drew throwing dagger and with a lunge and a flick/turn of the forearm and wrist, threw the quivering blade. 

It struck pavement next to a dying drunk in a splatter burst of caveman fire spray. Grabby yelped. But there was no sorcerer of the sands over there. 

Or anywhere. 

Goddamit. 

""Up here.”

The headhunter whirled once more, a dancer upon my stage thought the sorcerer but kept it to himself. The German would not appreciate such an observation. 

""Why do you hide in a tree?” asked the black knight of the goat-shape order impetiously. 

The sorcerer grinned, balanced on the branch of a starving sapling oak. Running alongside a dark and quiet apartment building. 

""I've always appreciated a wider view, German. Always. Up here, I see more and I am closer to heaven and therefore I can see more like God. You… and your brothers… you stay down there in the dirt because you cannot know anything more."" 

Azræl raised blade. 

“Come down here and show me what I know, mongrel. Perhaps I can show you a thing or two as well."" 

The sorcerer shrugged. 

“Eh."" 

Azræl drew once more and threw. The throwing blade of ornate seven pointed star flew unabated, cutting through the nighttime chill like a deadly bird of sharpened stabbing steel. 

But when the piercing blade found the place in the tree where the heart of the sorcerer was, it no longer was there. 

It never had been. 

""I'm always behind you, German.” 

He spun on his booted heels and his great arms carried his tireless steel down in another great chop. But it was already too late. 

The sorcerer raised the ney and blocked the blow as if the wind instrument was an iron bar. He then flew in, swift movement that was not at all human or natural, stepping in close and bringing the long cylindrical body of the instrument down in a cracking blow across the headhunter's crown, splitting it and knocking consciousness from his mind's failing grip. 

But as he sent the headhunter's mind on a journey into darkness, he gave it another vision. A vision of flames. 

…

Jerusalem. 

Burning Jerusalem. 

where will you turn when it all goes wrong…?

The holy city is a cinder shrieking thousands as one. The holy city is in flames. 

… and you're on the run

And all around the city is a newly erected manmade hellscape forest grove. All around the city are the impaling lancing sticks. On them are the impaled. All of them are still screaming, screaming with their burning city. Man. Woman. Child. Animal. The warriors that have done this like to crucify lions for fun but for now, this will suffice. The people of the Lord's precious city will make satisfactory sport. 

And they do. As the forest of the impaled. All of them beg for death, they are the only words left, the only ones they can remember now in the throes of this special agony. Thousands upon thousands of shrieking lanced through but still living souls. Bodies skewered every which way, up through the groin, behind the genitals, upside down and through the tissue of the back, up the ass, gravity pulls savagely as if hungry and they slowly sink lower and lower along the stabbing spire body of the impaling lances as the time drags by with sadistic cruelty. The sheer heart attack torture of the sensations of tearing and rupture and bodily invasion and ruin as all and one horrible coalescence is all that any of them are capable of knowing in their last drawn out hours. For many it is days. 

And beside the forest of the impaled and all of its mindless shrieking, the burning city. 

Jerusalem. 

…

When the headhunter returned from darkness he was lying alone in the street. 

He sat up quickly, Panicked! 

His great sword was still clutched tightly. 

But when he looked around, the drunk that had been watching them was dead now. Blood foamed from his eyes and mouth like a hot porridge stew of thick sudsy pink. 

Worse yet, the sorcerer was gone. 

Worse than that, so were the heads. 

So was his offering…

Goddamit.

The Nazis were right. You are a degenerate species…

It was all of it a swollen pustule sac. A land of green milk and curdled cheese, cockroaches swam in the stew of discharge and mire and laughably called it a metropolitan. A cultural hub. 

A blade of a smile formed amongst a tumult of dark and ageless hair, a wizard's haggard beard. Blasted by sand and sun just like the rest of the white robed man. White robed death.

Jericho. Troy. Münster. Constantinople. Alexandria. Roanoke. Ikeshima. Rome. 

And many others… great and small. He doesn't care. He only loved to watch as the red hand of Iblis crawled across the blackening surface of all things dying in its embrace, turning the whole of the world into its killing floor. 

But that wasn't all with this place. No. He was sent here not just to burn but to gather intelligence for the order. 

And to contest.

But still they had nothing. Except that he liked to chop off heads. And leave them at churches for some fucking reason. 

And one other thing. One oddity that more than a few of the sharper minds amongst the rank and file of criminal investigators found to be interesting. 

But did it mean anything? 

All of them. Every head found belonged to someone with a rap sheet that read more like a tome. Miles long some of em. Each and every one of em had a history. 

Mob hits! that was the popular running theory around the suits and their steaming white paper cups of coffee. 

It wasn't a bad one, most thought.

The blood that chokes the earth sloshes mire-like about the furnace steps of them all. Charlemagne has demanded these pagan northmen be put to kneel before the cross or be put to the sword. Slavery for their women and children…

… and the knights were thus dispatched thither…

The headhunter severed the line of thought or memory or whatever it was with brutal sudden cunning and roared into the empty silent night.

“Show yourself, mongrel!"" 

His laughter never seemed to cease. It stood in place of a physical person. Almost attaining its own physicality.

“You hurl insults because you've nothing else to throw! Nothing else to attack! You are hilarious, German! I've always liked you but you should not be so easy, not after all this time, no?"" 

He had to be careful. The sorcerer was dangerous. He could bend and weave reality seemingly at will, like a djin. None of his brotherhood nor the high priest could discern his source of power. Nor its limits. 

“I insult you, witch, because you and your kind are garbage."" 

Laughter that became a cacophonous crack! It dominated the world, the soundtrack hell to the neon witching scene. The music somehow came to life and began to play again, a wicked untethered horde flurry series of scaling and wild notes in wild man tandem with the laughter of the sorcerer, a corruption duet.

A ney. The headhunter remembers what it is that the instrument is called. A ney. 

Its sound and the sorcerer's laughter were a whirlwind maelstrom expansion sound swell within his skull. For a moment he considered taking his own blade and driving it into his own face, bashing it in and freeing that which was trapped within and growing, threatening to burst like the milk of green infection.

He stopped himself at the last moment. His training saving him. He recognized what was happening, what it was…

… bewitchment. 

He regained his focus against the tumult wave of sound storm wielded by the sorcerer, who once again cried out from nowhere. 

“Garbage! We are all garbage for the earth, German. We are all meat detritus for the watering jaws of the starving soil, we all return to it, are all reduced to ruin and returned to the sour womb to feed the indifferent planet. You know! You know! Only our petty Gods care! And so they fight! And, we, their moving pieces!”

And with that, the pieces did move. 

 Hand of Iblis. The mad sorcerer. 

Against champion of the goat-shape, Azræl.

And this modern Sodom of steel and human woe was to be the chess board for their latest match. A contest of secret champions. 

He did not see, but felt… 

Behind him. Movement. Killing stance. 

The headhunter whirled round with sudden animal speed in a counter slash. Roaring. 

But he roared… and slashed… at nothing. 

Nothing there. Only thin night air. 

Laughter/voice. Behind him again. 

“The same tricks always work on all of you."" 

He whirled once more. Nothing. 

The laughter again. Across the street. 

Azræl drew throwing dagger and with a lunge and a flick/turn of the forearm and wrist, threw the quivering blade. 

It struck pavement next to a dying drunk in a splatter burst of caveman fire spray. Grabby yelped. But there was no sorcerer of the sands over there. 

Or anywhere. 

Goddamit. 

""Up here.”

The headhunter whirled once more, a dancer upon my stage thought the sorcerer but kept it to himself. The German would not appreciate such an observation. 

""Why do you hide in a tree?” asked the black knight of the goat-shape order impetiously. 

The sorcerer grinned, balanced on the branch of a starving sapling oak. Running alongside a dark and quiet apartment building. 

""I've always appreciated a wider view, German. Always. Up here, I see more and I am closer to heaven and therefore I can see more like God. You… and your brothers… you stay down there in the dirt because you cannot know anything more."" 

Azræl raised blade. 

“Come down here and show me what I know, mongrel. Perhaps I can show you a thing or two as well."" 

The sorcerer shrugged. 

“Eh."" 

Azræl drew once more and threw. The throwing blade of ornate seven pointed star flew unabated, cutting through the nighttime chill like a deadly bird of sharpened stabbing steel. 

But when the piercing blade found the place in the tree where the heart of the sorcerer was, it no longer was there. 

It never had been. 

""I'm always behind you, German.” 

He spun on his booted heels and his great arms carried his tireless steel down in another great chop. But it was already too late. 

The sorcerer raised the ney and blocked the blow as if the wind instrument was an iron bar. He then flew in, swift movement that was not at all human or natural, stepping in close and bringing the long cylindrical body of the instrument down in a cracking blow across the headhunter's crown, splitting it and knocking consciousness from his mind's failing grip. 

But as he sent the headhunter's mind on a journey into darkness, he gave it another vision. A vision of flames. 

…

Jerusalem. 

Burning Jerusalem. 

where will you turn when it all goes wrong…?

The holy city is a cinder shrieking thousands as one. The holy city is in flames. 

… and you're on the run

And all around the city is a newly erected manmade hellscape forest grove. All around the city are the impaling lancing sticks. On them are the impaled. All of them are still screaming, screaming with their burning city. Man. Woman. Child. Animal. The warriors that have done this like to crucify lions for fun but for now, this will suffice. The people of the Lord's precious city will make satisfactory sport. 

And they do. As the forest of the impaled. All of them beg for death, they are the only words left, the only ones they can remember now in the throes of this special agony. Thousands upon thousands of shrieking lanced through but still living souls. Bodies skewered every which way, up through the groin, behind the genitals, upside down and through the tissue of the back, up the ass, gravity pulls savagely as if hungry and they slowly sink lower and lower along the stabbing spire body of the impaling lances as the time drags by with sadistic cruelty. The sheer heart attack torture of the sensations of tearing and rupture and bodily invasion and ruin as all and one horrible coalescence is all that any of them are capable of knowing in their last drawn out hours. For many it is days. 

And beside the forest of the impaled and all of its mindless shrieking, the burning city. 

Jerusalem. 

…

When the headhunter returned from darkness he was lying alone in the street. 

He sat up quickly, Panicked! 

His great sword was still clutched tightly. 

But when he looked around, the drunk that had been watching them was dead now. Blood foamed from his eyes and mouth like a hot porridge stew of thick sudsy pink. 

Worse yet, the sorcerer was gone. 

Worse than that, so were the heads. 

So was his offering…

Goddamit.

1r74o2v,https://i.redd.it/95z9u887t1kg1.jpeg,Headhunter II,"The sorcerer had a funny thought, as he gazed down on all of the neon squalor glow of the Fallen Angel City below him from the rooftops edge.  

The Nazis were right. You are a degenerate species…

It was all of it a swollen pustule sac. A land of green milk and curdled cheese, cockroaches swam in the stew of discharge and mire and laughably called it a metropolitan. A cultural hub. 

A blade of a smile formed amongst a tumult of dark and ageless hair, a wizard's haggard beard. Blasted by sand and sun just like the rest of the white robed man. White robed death. 

Some say he is the mad author of the Necronomicon. He has authored the destruction of countless cities, countless places… before this one. 

Jericho. Troy. Münster. Constantinople. Alexandria. Roanoke. Ikeshima. Rome. 

And many others… great and small. He doesn't care. He only loved to watch as the red hand of Iblis crawled across the blackening surface of all things dying in its embrace, turning the whole of the world into its killing floor. 

But that wasn't all with this place. No. He was sent here not just to burn but to gather intelligence for the order. 

And to contest. 

…

Homicide was scrambling. They had nothing. What commonalities they did find between the victims was interesting… but it only led to more bafflement. More flummoxed minds in the busying police departments all across the city. All bullshit pretension had been dropped, all departments across all counties and neighborhoods were working together on this one, to bring the crazy fucking bastard in. 

But still they had nothing. Except that he liked to chop off heads. And leave them at churches for some fucking reason. 

And one other thing. One oddity that more than a few of the sharper minds amongst the rank and file of criminal investigators found to be interesting. 

But did it mean anything? 

All of them. Every head found belonged to someone with a rap sheet that read more like a tome. Miles long some of em. Each and every one of em had a history. 

Mob hits! that was the popular running theory around the suits and their steaming white paper cups of coffee. 

It wasn't a bad one, most thought. 

Could be. Could be.

…

Azræl leapt from the dark and charged into the man as he was making his way to his car. Slamming him into the driver's door as he tried to open it and catching him by surprise. 

This was the one. This was one of the faces the goat-shape demanded be brought before her feet. 

His hand, clenched tightly round the hilt of his great sword came up and bashed the maggot across the mouth with the metal pommel of the weapon. A crack, and a splurt of hot blood and teeth out the mouth and the maggot went down to his knees, mewling. 

Where he belonged. 

The maggot struggled to speak and beg as the headhunter raised his great blade above his head. Readying to strike. 

“Not at all for you or yourself. Swear to her. Pray to me.” said Azræl as he brought the blade down and cleaved the head free from the rest of the meat. It tumble-jumped with a ropey-cord tail of thick black red that the stump continued to produce and shoot in dark gouts for a moment before the headless body collapsed to the street. 

And then the night was quiet again. All around.  Lights buzzed and mock heaven glowed. 

The peace was relative, conditionary. You could still hear the ghost song of sirens in the distance. Wailing away in flight, in search, in search of anything. 

Azræl picked up the head and said his prayers to the goat-shaped lord of his house and order. He tied it to the belt of his hulking black leather visage to join two others and went on his way. 

The sorcerer watched. The sorcerer was impressed. 

…

He heaved. Spewed. Decorated the sidewalk and gutter in more bile, blood and stomach lining as another sharp stab in his stomach racked his guts and his convulsion threatened to roll over into a seizing tear in his brain. 

Homeless and well past his last leg, Elton prayed for death as his sickened body worsened on the pavement, alone at the bus stop. Underneath the flickering glow of a dying bulb, a failing light. 

It was not death he received but something more spectacular. Elton, Grabby to his friends and scum and fellow urchins of the street, was made audience and thus unwitting chronicler to a chapter in a shadow conflict centuries upon centuries old, perhaps the oldest conflict in all of man's time. Perhaps even older than that. 

Grabby/Elton looked up from his own bloody spew of booze and lining and watched a giant titan walk into view. Destroying his solitude on this witching houred boulevard. 

He knew he must be fucked. The guy looked massive and he looked like Mad Max or the Terminator or someone like that and he looked like he was carrying a huge fucking sword. 

And along his belt were a buncha fuckin heads…

No fucking way. The dying urchin refused it. No fuckin way am I actually seein that fuckin thing. 

But real or not, the giant of myth and flesh and chained leather continued to march up and then past the druggie’s view, crossing to and then down the opposite side of the street. 

But then something made the headhunter stop. 

Elton heard it too. 

A note.  Notes. Music. 

A wind pattern series flurry of intricate and delicate notes whispered and alternate sharp-stab blasted through the nighttime witching air. Filling it. Dominating the scene. 

Azræl tensed cat-like coiled as his hair stood on end. The music was flute-like. Middle Eastern flavored…

Goddamit. No.

The headhunter was filled with dread. 

The music stopped. An ancient voice, bold, cut through the night. 

“How are you, German? Been long time."" 

His stance shifted to battle ready as his blade came up raised. His voice, louder, cut through the night as well to the speaker unseen. But he knew who it was to whom he spoke. 

""What do you want, snake?”

Laughter. Real. The knight Azræl always was good for a laugh as far the sorcerer was concerned.

“So funny?"" Azræl said to the night all around him. “Come out and show me what's so funny, witch."" 

More laughter. 

“Have we not shared many things over the long years, my friend? Such a long time. A great deal.”

A series of images flicker-shot through the headhunter's mind then. Whether put there by the devilry of the sorcerer or memories of his own from one of many possible past lives, Azræl was not sure. If he lived through this encounter he would meditate and pray on the matter later. 

If he lived through this encounter. 

His mind's eye:

The forests and the forest people and their villages are burning. There is much bloodletting. The ground is gorged, it cannot possibly drink up all of it. It sloshes about the ankles of the soldiering and the marching and the frantic frightened running. The pursuers too. The blood that chokes the earth sloshes mire-like about the furnace steps of them all. Charlemagne has demanded these pagan northmen be put to kneel before the cross or be put to the sword.

Laughter that became a cacophonous crack! It dominated the world, the soundtrack hell to the neon witching scene. The music somehow came to life and began to play again, a wicked untethered horde flurry series of scaling and wild notes in wild man tandem with the laughter of the sorcerer, a corruption duet.

A ney. The headhunter remembers what it is that the instrument is called. A ney. 

Its sound and the sorcerer's laughter were a whirlwind maelstrom expansion sound swell within his skull. For a moment he considered taking his own blade and driving it into his own face, bashing it in and freeing that which was trapped within and growing, threatening to burst like the milk of green infection.

He stopped himself at the last moment. His training saving him. He recognized what was happening, what it was…

… bewitchment. 

He regained his focus against the tumult wave of sound storm wielded by the sorcerer, who once again cried out from nowhere. 

“Garbage! We are all garbage for the earth, German. We are all meat detritus for the watering jaws of the starving soil, we all return to it, are all reduced to ruin and returned to the sour womb to feed the indifferent planet. You know! You know!

And with that, the pieces did move. 

 Hand of Iblis. The mad sorcerer. 

Against champion of the goat-shape, Azræl.

And this modern Sodom of steel and human woe was to be the chess board for their latest match. A contest of secret champions. 

He did not see, but felt… 

Behind him. Movement. Killing stance. 

The headhunter whirled round with sudden animal speed in a counter slash. Roaring. 

But he roared… and slashed… at nothing. 

Nothing there. Only thin night air. 

Laughter/voice. Behind him again. 

“The same tricks always work on all of you."" 

He whirled once more. Nothing.

Azræl drew throwing dagger and with a lunge and a flick/turn of the forearm and wrist, threw the quivering blade. 

It struck pavement next to a dying drunk in a splatter burst of caveman fire spray. Grabby yelped. But there was no sorcerer of the sands over there. 

Or anywhere. 

Goddamit. 

""Up here.”

The headhunter whirled once more, a dancer upon my stage thought the sorcerer but kept it to himself. The German would not appreciate such an observation. 

""Why do you hide in a tree?” asked the black knight of the goat-shape order impetiously. 

The sorcerer grinned, balanced on the branch of a starving sapling oak. Running alongside a dark and quiet apartment building. 

""I've always appreciated a wider view, German. Always. Up here, I see more and I am closer to heaven and therefore I can see more like God. You… and your brothers… you stay down there in the dirt because you cannot know anything more."" 

Azræl raised blade. 

“Come down here and show me what I know, mongrel. Perhaps I can show you a thing or two as well."" 

The sorcerer shrugged. 

“Eh."" 

Azræl drew once more and threw. The throwing blade of ornate seven pointed star flew unabated, cutting through the nighttime chill like a deadly bird of sharpened stabbing steel. 

But when the piercing blade found the place in the tree where the heart of the sorcerer was, it no longer was there. 

It never had been. 

""I'm always behind you, German.” 

He spun on his booted heels and his great arms carried his tireless steel down in another great chop. But it was already too late. 

The sorcerer raised the ney and blocked the blow as if the wind instrument was an iron bar. He then flew in, swift movement that was not at all human or natural, stepping in close and bringing the long cylindrical body of the instrument down in a cracking blow across the headhunter's crown, splitting it and knocking consciousness from his mind's failing grip. 

But as he sent the headhunter's mind on a journey into darkness, he gave it another vision. A vision of flames. 

…

Jerusalem. 

Burning Jerusalem. 

where will you turn when it all goes wrong…?

The holy city is a cinder shrieking thousands as one. The holy city is in flames. 

… and you're on the run

And all around the city is a newly erected manmade hellscape forest grove. All around the city are the impaling lancing sticks. On them are the impaled. All of them are still screaming, screaming with their burning city. Man. Woman. Child. Animal. The warriors that have done this like to crucify lions for fun but for now, this will suffice. The people of the Lord's precious city will make satisfactory sport. 

And they do. As the forest of the impaled. All of them beg for death, they are the only words left, the only ones they can remember now in the throes of this special agony. Thousands upon thousands of shrieking lanced through but still living souls. Bodies skewered every which way, up through the groin, behind the genitals, upside down and through the tissue of the back, up the ass, gravity pulls savagely as if hungry and they slowly sink lower and lower along the stabbing spire body of the impaling lances as the time drags by with sadistic cruelty. The sheer heart attack torture of the sensations of tearing and rupture and bodily invasion and ruin as all and one horrible coalescence is all that any of them are capable of knowing in their last drawn out hours. For many it is days. 

And beside the forest of the impaled and all of its mindless shrieking, the burning city. 

Jerusalem. 

…

When the headhunter returned from darkness he was lying alone in the street. 

He sat up quickly, Panicked! 

His great sword was still clutched tightly. 

But when he looked around, the drunk that had been watching them was dead now. Blood foamed from his eyes and mouth like a hot porridge stew of thick sudsy pink. 

Worse yet, the sorcerer was gone. 

Worse than that, so were the heads. 

So was his offering…

Goddamit.

Of course I went all in: bottomless portafilter, Kingrinder K6, fresh beans, scale, the full home barista starter pack.

I’ve pulled a lot of shots. I tried to learn the basics. After a few months I can get something objectively decent. But I never found a coffee that made me think “this is really good” without spending a small fortune on beans. The frustrating part is that on paper everything looks right: ratios, shot time, dose but the taste is always off. Too bitter, or too acidic. I never seem to hit that balance in the cup. So I’m pretty sure I’m doing something wrong.

The other day I felt like having an Americano. I bought a €30 drip machine on Amazon and a bag of pre-ground Starbucks Veranda because I used to drink it at the office.

I brewed it. It tasted good. Easy, balanced, finally.

Now it’s been days and I’m only drinking that.

My Dedica and the Kingrinder are sitting there, silently judging me. I started this whole espresso journey chasing perfection and ended up happy with pre-ground filter coffee.

1r74mbl,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1r74mbl/headhunter_ii/,Headhunter II,"The sorcerer had a funny thought, as he gazed down on all of the neon squalor glow of the Fallen Angel City below him from the rooftops edge.  

The Nazis were right. You are a degenerate species…

It was all of it a swollen pustule sac. A land of green milk and curdled cheese, cockroaches swam in the stew of discharge and mire and laughably called it a metropolitan. A cultural hub. 

A blade of a smile formed amongst a tumult of dark and ageless hair, a wizard's haggard beard. Blasted by sand and sun just like the rest of the white robed man. White robed death. 

Some say he is the mad author of the Necronomicon. He has authored the destruction of countless cities, countless places… before this one. 

Jericho. Troy. Münster. Constantinople. Alexandria. Roanoke. Ikeshima. Rome. 

And many others… great and small. He doesn't care. He only loved to watch as the red hand of Iblis crawled across the blackening surface of all things dying in its embrace, turning the whole of the world into its killing floor. 

But that wasn't all with this place. No. He was sent here not just to burn but to gather intelligence for the order. 

And to contest. 

…

Homicide was scrambling. They had nothing. What commonalities they did find between the victims was interesting… but it only led to more bafflement. More flummoxed minds in the busying police departments all across the city. All bullshit pretension had been dropped, all departments across all counties and neighborhoods were working together on this one, to bring the crazy fucking bastard in. 

But still they had nothing. Except that he liked to chop off heads. And leave them at churches for some fucking reason. 

And one other thing. One oddity that more than a few of the sharper minds amongst the rank and file of criminal investigators found to be interesting. 

But did it mean anything? 

All of them. Every head found belonged to someone with a rap sheet that read more like a tome. Miles long some of em. Each and every one of em had a history. 

Mob hits! that was the popular running theory around the suits and their steaming white paper cups of coffee. 

It wasn't a bad one, most thought. 

Could be. Could be.

…

Azræl leapt from the dark and charged into the man as he was making his way to his car. Slamming him into the driver's door as he tried to open it and catching him by surprise. 

This was the one. This was one of the faces the goat-shape demanded be brought before her feet. 

His hand, clenched tightly round the hilt of his great sword came up and bashed the maggot across the mouth with the metal pommel of the weapon. A crack, and a splurt of hot blood and teeth out the mouth and the maggot went down to his knees, mewling. 

Where he belonged. 

The maggot struggled to speak and beg as the headhunter raised his great blade above his head. Readying to strike. 

“Not at all for you or yourself. Swear to her. Pray to me.” said Azræl as he brought the blade down and cleaved the head free from the rest of the meat. It tumble-jumped with a ropey-cord tail of thick black red that the stump continued to produce and shoot in dark gouts for a moment before the headless body collapsed to the street. 

And then the night was quiet again. All around.  Lights buzzed and mock heaven glowed. 

The peace was relative, conditionary. You could still hear the ghost song of sirens in the distance. Wailing away in flight, in search, in search of anything. 

Azræl picked up the head and said his prayers to the goat-shaped lord of his house and order. He tied it to the belt of his hulking black leather visage to join two others and went on his way. 

The sorcerer watched. The sorcerer was impressed. 

…

He heaved. Spewed. Decorated the sidewalk and gutter in more bile, blood and stomach lining as another sharp stab in his stomach racked his guts and his convulsion threatened to roll over into a seizing tear in his brain. 

Homeless and well past his last leg, Elton prayed for death as his sickened body worsened on the pavement, alone at the bus stop. Underneath the flickering glow of a dying bulb, a failing light. 

It was not death he received but something more spectacular. Elton, Grabby to his friends and scum and fellow urchins of the street, was made audience and thus unwitting chronicler to a chapter in a shadow conflict centuries upon centuries old, perhaps the oldest conflict in all of man's time. Perhaps even older than that. 

Grabby/Elton looked up from his own bloody spew of booze and lining and watched a giant titan walk into view. Destroying his solitude on this witching houred boulevard. 

He knew he must be fucked. The guy looked massive and he looked like Mad Max or the Terminator or someone like that and he looked like he was carrying a huge fucking sword. 

And along his belt were a buncha fuckin heads…

No fucking way. The dying urchin refused it. No fuckin way am I actually seein that fuckin thing. 

But real or not, the giant of myth and flesh and chained leather continued to march up and then past the druggie’s view, crossing to and then down the opposite side of the street. 

But then something made the headhunter stop. 

Elton heard it too. 

A note.  Notes. Music. 

A wind pattern series flurry of intricate and delicate notes whispered and alternate sharp-stab blasted through the nighttime witching air. Filling it. Dominating the scene. 

Azræl tensed cat-like coiled as his hair stood on end. The music was flute-like. Middle Eastern flavored…

Goddamit. No.

The headhunter was filled with dread. 

The music stopped. An ancient voice, bold, cut through the night. 

“How are you, German? Been long time."" 

His stance shifted to battle ready as his blade came up raised. His voice, louder, cut through the night as well to the speaker unseen. But he knew who it was to whom he spoke. 

""What do you want, snake?”

Laughter. Real. The knight Azræl always was good for a laugh as far the sorcerer was concerned.

“So funny?"" Azræl said to the night all around him. “Come out and show me what's so funny, witch."" 

More laughter. 

“Have we not shared many things over the long years, my friend? Such a long time. A great deal.”

A series of images flicker-shot through the headhunter's mind then. Whether put there by the devilry of the sorcerer or memories of his own from one of many possible past lives, Azræl was not sure. If he lived through this encounter he would meditate and pray on the matter later. 

If he lived through this encounter. 

His mind's eye:

The forests and the forest people and their villages are burning. There is much bloodletting. The ground is gorged, it cannot possibly drink up all of it. It sloshes about the ankles of the soldiering and the marching and the frantic frightened running. The pursuers too. The blood that chokes the earth sloshes mire-like about the furnace steps of them all. Charlemagne has demanded these pagan northmen be put to kneel before the cross or be put to the sword. Slavery for their women and children…

… and the knights were thus dispatched thither…

The headhunter severed the line of thought or memory or whatever it was with brutal sudden cunning and roared into the empty silent night.

“Show yourself, mongrel!"" 

His laughter never seemed to cease. It stood in place of a physical person. Almost attaining its own physicality.

“You hurl insults because you've nothing else to throw! Nothing else to attack! You are hilarious, German! I've always liked you but you should not be so easy, not after all this time, no?"" 

He had to be careful. The sorcerer was dangerous. He could bend and weave reality seemingly at will, like a djin. None of his brotherhood nor the high priest could discern his source of power. Nor its limits. 

“I insult you, witch, because you and your kind are garbage."" 

Laughter that became a cacophonous crack! It dominated the world, the soundtrack hell to the neon witching scene. The music somehow came to life and began to play again, a wicked untethered horde flurry series of scaling and wild notes in wild man tandem with the laughter of the sorcerer, a corruption duet.

A ney. The headhunter remembers what it is that the instrument is called. A ney. 

Its sound and the sorcerer's laughter were a whirlwind maelstrom expansion sound swell within his skull. For a moment he considered taking his own blade and driving it into his own face, bashing it in and freeing that which was trapped within and growing, threatening to burst like the milk of green infection.

He stopped himself at the last moment. His training saving him. He recognized what was happening, what it was…

… bewitchment. 

He regained his focus against the tumult wave of sound storm wielded by the sorcerer, who once again cried out from nowhere. 

“Garbage! We are all garbage for the earth, German. We are all meat detritus for the watering jaws of the starving soil, we all return to it, are all reduced to ruin and returned to the sour womb to feed the indifferent planet. You know! You know! Only our petty Gods care! And so they fight! And, we, their moving pieces!”

And with that, the pieces did move. 

 Hand of Iblis. The mad sorcerer. 

Against champion of the goat-shape, Azræl.

And this modern Sodom of steel and human woe was to be the chess board for their latest match. A contest of secret champions. 

He did not see, but felt… 

Behind him. Movement. Killing stance. 

The headhunter whirled round with sudden animal speed in a counter slash. Roaring. 

But he roared… and slashed… at nothing. 

Nothing there. Only thin night air. 

Laughter/voice. Behind him again. 

“The same tricks always work on all of you."" 

He whirled once more. Nothing. 

The laughter again. Across the street. 

Azræl drew throwing dagger and with a lunge and a flick/turn of the forearm and wrist, threw the quivering blade. 

It struck pavement next to a dying drunk in a splatter burst of caveman fire spray. Grabby yelped. But there was no sorcerer of the sands over there. 

Or anywhere. 

Goddamit. 

""Up here.”

The headhunter whirled once more, a dancer upon my stage thought the sorcerer but kept it to himself. The German would not appreciate such an observation. 

""Why do you hide in a tree?” asked the black knight of the goat-shape order impetiously. 

The sorcerer grinned, balanced on the branch of a starving sapling oak. Running alongside a dark and quiet apartment building. 

""I've always appreciated a wider view, German. Always. Up here, I see more and I am closer to heaven and therefore I can see more like God. You… and your brothers… you stay down there in the dirt because you cannot know anything more."" 

Azræl raised blade. 

“Come down here and show me what I know, mongrel. Perhaps I can show you a thing or two as well."" 

The sorcerer shrugged. 

“Eh."" 

Azræl drew once more and threw. The throwing blade of ornate seven pointed star flew unabated, cutting through the nighttime chill like a deadly bird of sharpened stabbing steel. 

But when the piercing blade found the place in the tree where the heart of the sorcerer was, it no longer was there. 

It never had been. 

""I'm always behind you, German.” 

He spun on his booted heels and his great arms carried his tireless steel down in another great chop. But it was already too late. 

The sorcerer raised the ney and blocked the blow as if the wind instrument was an iron bar. He then flew in, swift movement that was not at all human or natural, stepping in close and bringing the long cylindrical body of the instrument down in a cracking blow across the headhunter's crown, splitting it and knocking consciousness from his mind's failing grip.

Here's my tried-and-true method for finding legitimate online deals without the fluff (saved $250+ last quarter on home goods) 💸,"Alright, let's talk about deals. You know that feeling when you think you snagged a great discount, only to find out later it was either the regular price, or worse, cheaper elsewhere? Yeah, I've been there too many times. Especially around ""sale"" seasons like Black Friday where it feels like 90% of the offers are just smoke and mirrors.

I got fed up with it. So, for the past few months, I've been actively tracking prices and doing my homework before buying anything significant, and honestly, the difference is pretty wild. It takes a bit of effort, but finding *real* savings feels way better than falling for a phantom discount.

Here's a few things I've actually saved money on by putting in a little legwork:

*   **Wireless Earbuds (Specific Brand X, Model Y):** Saw these advertised for $129 almost everywhere. After about 30 minutes of digging through price trackers and smaller authorized resellers, I found them for **$85** on an obscure electronics site. That's a solid **34% off** the standard price, not some marked-up ""original."" *Caveat:* Shipping took an extra week, but for $44, I didn't mind.
*   **Kitchen Mixer (Brand Z, 5qt model):** Needed a new one. Major retailers had it at $349. I set up a price alert on a few different sites and waited. Within two weeks, a lesser-known kitchen supply store had a flash sale – got it for **$275**. Saved **$74**, just by being patient and not buying impulsively.
*   **Monthly Coffee Subscription:** I love good coffee, but the prices add up. Instead of just sticking with the first subscription I found, I spent about an hour comparing per-ounce prices, shipping costs, and reviewing different roasters. Ended up switching to one that gives me slightly better beans for about **15% less** overall per month. Small, but it adds up over a year.
*   **Computer Monitor (27-inch 1440p):** Best Buy had it for $399. I used a browser extension to check historical pricing and saw it often dropped to $320-$350. I waited a week, and sure enough, it hit $330 at Amazon. Saved **$69**.

Now, don't get me wrong, this isn't a magic bullet. You're not going to save 50% on everything you buy, and sometimes, the best deal *is* just the regular price. It also takes *time*. I probably spend an extra 15-30 minutes per significant purchase, and sometimes I come up empty-handed. Stock can be limited on the really good finds, and some lesser-known stores might have slower shipping or stricter return policies. You need to verify the seller, especially if it's a site you haven't heard of.

But for me, that effort has consistently paid off, and it feels good to know I'm not just falling for clever marketing.

I’ve been messing around with crypto for a couple of years now, mostly dipping my toes into DeFi and some staking, but GoMining has really caught my attention lately. It’s like they’ve taken the hassle out of Bitcoin mining and turned it into this accessible, fun ecosystem that actually feels rewarding without needing a garage full of noisy rigs. I figured I’d share my personal experience and thoughts here maybe spark some discussion since I’m still learning the ropes myself.

Let me start with the digital miners. These things are basically tokenized shares of real mining power in their data centers. I picked up a modest one with about 5 TH/s a few months back (nothing crazy, just testing the waters), and it’s been chugging along, dropping small but steady BTC rewards into my virtual wallet every day. No upfront hardware costs, no dealing with skyrocketing electricity bills it’s all handled on their end. I love how transparent it is; you can track your hashrate and efficiency right in the app. The payback period isn’t instant, but based on current BTC prices, it’s looking like 27-30% annual returns in rewards, which beats a lot of traditional savings options. Plus, if you’re holding GOMINING tokens, you can slash maintenance fees by up to 20%, making the whole thing even more efficient. It’s given me a nice passive income stream that fits right into my busy schedule I check it during coffee breaks and withdraw whenever I want, zero fees.

Speaking of the GOMINING token, it’s the glue that holds the ecosystem together. Beyond the discounts, it’s got real utility: you can use it for in app purchases, stake it on their launchpad for up to 30% APY (which is insane in this market), or even get royalties and boosts. I staked a chunk of mine recently and it’s already earning me extra perks. It’s listed on major exchanges like Uniswap and HTX, so liquidity isn’t an issue. The token’s backed by actual business value from their mining ops, which makes it feel more stable than some meme coins out there. I’ve seen the price fluctuate, but the utility keeps me holding it’s not just hype.

Now, the part that’s got me hooked: Miner Wars. This is their play to earn game that turns mining into a competitive battle royale. You join or create clans, upgrade your miners, and compete to “capture” the next Bitcoin block simulation. My clan (a small group of friends I roped in) has been grinding through ranks, and we’ve snagged some BTC rewards from clan wins, plus GOMINING tokens from personal battles. It’s strategic you have to think about power efficiency, team coordination, and even boosts from the token. Last week, we hit a top 10 spot in a round and split a decent BTC payout. It’s free to play if you own a digital miner, and it adds this gaming layer to crypto that makes it way more engaging than just watching charts. If you’re a gamer like me, it’s a perfect blend; reminds me of old school strategy games but with real crypto stakes.

Overall, the rewards system ties it all together beautifully. Daily BTC from miners, game winnings, staking yields it’s designed to keep you involved and growing your holdings. I’ve probably earned back my initial investment already, and it’s motivating me to scale up. But hey, I’m no expert what about you all? Have you tried Miner Wars, and what’s your go to strategy for clans? Any tips on optimizing rewards with the GOMINING token, or stories about big wins? Or if you’re new like I was, what’s holding you back from jumping in?

He came up to me  - and the part I caught was something like  ‘Behalten Sie Ihre Gedanken für sich’

I just replied ‘Das ist von der Meinungsfreiheit gedeckt’ to which he said something under his breath and walked off. I just decided to leave as it was a really unpleasant interaction.  Nobody around said anything either. I tried to get eye contact with another guy opposite but he just looked down. 

The one who was offended looked quite normal tbh- well groomed and not thuggish at all. Like a 30 something papa in a decent job you’d see sipping a coffee somewhere. I know there’s stereotypes but somehow I’d never have pegged this guy as a person would take offence to a sticker like that - which says a lot about books and covers.

1r74ao5,https://i.redd.it/44j86lxlp1kg1.jpeg,Awkardly Shaped Lounge,"Just bought a new place. 

Nice enough but the lounge is shaped weirdly with 3 entrances/exit points 

I currently have two Sofas (three seater and two seater) and a potentially even a dining table, I'm trying to fit in here, but can't for the life of me work it out. 

Tempted to go down to one sofa. Feels like a TV would be useful, but not a must-have. 

I'm limited due to 3 entrance/exit points (stairs, kitchen and hallway). 

The hallway isn't used for anything other than mail, but it still looks a bit odd blocking off a door. 

This lounge isn't going to be used much (I barely watch TV) but it would be nice to relax and read a book/work from the sofa. 

Does anyone have any ideas how to lay everything out? 

Also have an armchair that could fit somewhere and some bookshelves / long coffee table. 

Dining table isn't a must as can go elsewhere. 

Can add/remove furniture easily, but would like to make the most of the sofa I already have. 

Interested to see if anyone has any good ideas. Literally will chuck $10 to a charity of your choice to whoever can find the solution at this point",1,1771330136.0,DesignMyRoom,0,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

I'm in the process of setting up a fish tank room. I have 4 tortoises that also live in the fish tank room until I build them an outside enclosure. I also have one cat and one dog too. I love chatting about plants and fish. I breed and propagate fish/plants, so I'm always down to trade, too.

I've been drinking a lot of tea and coffee lately. Always like new suggestions for both. I'm trying to slowly get into doing more and more homesteading. I've started making my own breads and want to start making different jelly when it's warm enough for my berry bushes to produce

I'm into video games, too. I mainly play Overwatch, Marvel Rivals, Valorant, and Ark Suvival Ascended. Love playing Pokemon games and doing some Pokémon card collecting, too. I've been getting into playing more survival games than shooting games lately. I also built my PC to play on a couple of years ago.

I'm down to chat about any random stuff you like to chat about. Always up to try or learn about new hobbies. ",1,1771329679.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

1r744ii,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToxicWorkplace/comments/1r744ii/working_for_small_companies/,Working for small companies,"My last experience with a temp agency to a ""family run business,"" should have had me running for the hills immediately. I'm kicking myself for even taking the job. 
So that was my first mistake. The next thing to overcome was the 90-day probationary period. After this, I was told they would sign me on. But  strange things started to begin to happen. 
First, hazing is still apparently a thing. My second week on the job (the office had a rotation of who would load the dishwasher/stock fridge with water/etc. and it WAS NOT my week to do it) I put my coffee mug in the sink and was told to put it in the dishwasher (it hadn't been cleared in the morning from the clean dishes). 
Second, I began to realize that these people had no concept of camaraderie or even having a backbone. There was a time where (less than 2 months in at this point) a patient was upset about not getting an order and began to yell at me over the phone. What happened was I did not get the necessary information for this patient's order and the person who trained me was supposed to have worked on it. This, turned out to be so much more. I ended up crying in the bathroom for 30 minutes. After this, I was silent for weeks and people started to feel ""uncomfortable."" 
Third, after this event a few weeks later (my only time ever having a feedback session with my boss) we discussed what happened and she let me in to the fact that it was her who messed up. 
Fourth, there was different times just in passing hearing the words, ""well if you want to work here."" Clearly, I didn't. 
Fifth, more gossip floating around and hearing the employees say they have been told on different occasions that they are not allowed to talk about their pay. I promptly said, ""that's illegal and they can get in trouble for that."" Boy should I have known then to keep my mouth shut.
Now there are other minute details that also probably contributed to it. But one day on my way home, I was called my the temp agency (well over my 90 days or hours) saying that I had been let go and she was unsure of the specifics. Apparently, I had been making ""too many mistakes,"" to which I was not privvy of. And that the manager had sent a 2 sentence email stating that apparently. 
Now I was willing to put up with a lot, apparently, but working for a company like this, tip toeing on the line, is not my forte. Also, coming off of an SSRI that made me incredibly moody, didn't happen to help. 
If you take anything away from this, make sure they check all of YOUR boxes as well and when they say stuff like, ""we're a family here,"" ""that's was (x) fault,"" be wary and step away. ",2,1771329634.0,ToxicWorkplace,0,1.0,False

[#4],"Peter stirred awake with bruises all over his body, an ear-splitting headache, and a bandage around his left bicep. He was back in his Yancy Street apartment, the moon bright and up. In a corner, Alex was preparing coffee. Herman and Otto were discussing something among themselves. Aaron had just returned home with groceries, and Felicia was right by Peter’s side. He eventually realised what had happened: they knew what he was doing, and quite possibly his employment under Joseph.

Nobody confronted him. No raised voices, no judgement, nothing. Instead Otto and Herman presented something: it was Peter’s suit, mended for any tears or holes, with the addition of bulletproof padding and a spider insignia with two holes. Those holes, Otto explained, were there because the insignia was actually a pair of brass knuckles. Aaron, the most people-smart of them all, asserted that everyone in the Streetside Six were on his side, and would help him no matter what. He barely had time to say anything before the call came in: it was Joseph.

The Hammerhead had called to inform Peter of a major withdrawal from one of the accounts under his custody, a sum of ten million dollars they would use to bribe this new vigilante into staying away. Peter, maintaining an enthusiastic façade, agreed to the plan, and listened as Joseph, still on the call, accidentally instructed his men to prepare “the signal”. Soon enough, Peter noticed it: a searchlight on an old construction building. He quickly slipped into the new suit and was about to leave before Felicia stopped him. She told him that Otto had developed high-velocity wrist shooters so he could pull away from any situation fast, but that he needed some sort of wire.

Peter arrived on the rooftop hours later, having snuck into the site’s back entrance and stolen some tensile wiring from the storeroom. He tested the shooters on the rooftop of the building with the money in a large pile; they worked perfectly, and he slung himself onto the rooftop with ease. He took a long look at the money, contemplating his options: either take it and live a life blind to Hammerhead’s injustices, or leave it and risk his life and the lives of his friends. It took a while, but he had his decision.

Detective Stacy and Morris had followed the searchlight, hoping to bag both Joseph and the vigilante. They saw the latter on the rooftop ledge calling several people, who arrived within the hour with duffle bags. Detective Stacy volunteered to track the vigilante, while Morris would track the friends, who had taken a silver van from Mystery O. Little did both of them know, things were about to erupt into chaos, with only a web to hold everything together.",1,1771329537.0,WhatIfMarvel,0,1.0,False

There's also lots of other gadgets here. I work from home; most of my meetings are on Zoom. I also record videos for YouTube, but this is what the behind-the-scenes looks like.  
  
I've got:

* four displays
* some new Yamaha speakers
* two stream decks
* a stream deck pedal
* an Elgato prompter
* a nice coffee plate warmer
* Amaran Verge Max
* Neewer 660 Pro

Everything runs off a MacBook M4 Max. There's also a thunderbolt dock and everything else hiding in the cable tray for the Magnus.

The one problem I am giving up on solving is the wobblyness of the Elgato prompter which has my Sony A7III attached to it. I just don't think there is any way to stabilise it enough so will probably put that on a C-stand with wheels at some point.

I went with a black and white theme, mostly, with a hint of silver.

1r742fw,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1r742fw/16_year_old_brother_has_no_goals_in_life_more/,"16 year old brother has no goals in life + more, advice","He watched breaking bad at 14 and started idolising it. Stopped studying and says that 'he's too stupid anyway' while our brother (18) encourages those thoughts and berates him at every chance, completely destroyed all of his self esteem. 18y old brother was super insecure (too skinny and not social) and takes it out on him.

When I try to compliment fairly (like I used to) he brushes it off with 'shut the fuck up' 

Both are super emotionally unstable nowadays and latch out (physically and verbally) at asking to wear a coat instead of a hoodie when going outside at -5 celsius or when trying to wake them up for school.


We had other family issues too but the 16y old brother was super bright and lively all his life. Always super social and kind. Became a shut in, his room is like a nuclear site and all he does is game 24/7 or insult our younger sister and everyone else. I asked him to hangout so many times for months now and tried asking about what he wants to do, how can I help but nothing. He pushes me or shouts or mocks or insults. 

I feel guilty for not being able to protect him while I was away. 

Parents divorced (father used to hit me and mother and shout at everyone) but nowadays dad bought them pcs and takes them out to teach them how to be 'real men' while they make mother pour them boiling water into the instant coffee or do all their laundrg etc.

I used to talk to our parents about the negative consequences that'll follow but they brushed me off with 'what do you know about raising kids anyway'

I don't think either of them are concious of how they're 'parenting'

I begged my mother not to keep the pc and games when father bought them but she said 'it's their fathers gift, i have no rights or claim' 

Our father was a gaming addict all our life too, had no friends.

Idk what to do. Was an 'easy child' (grandparents quote), top 2-3 at school, lead few clubs and did sports too all my life but bombed final exams (and entirety of the last year of school) since I couldn't get a grip and became suicidal but because of that weakness didn't get to uni, nevermind scholarship.

Have no future now, turning 20 with invalid credentials and the only dream of attending a uni for mechanical engineering and student socialisation gone. Because of this my brothers ask for help when they don't understand school material but rest of the time dismiss me as a failure.

One moment it's 'help with calculus, I got 13% on a test' while the other is 'stupid whore know your place' 

Still don't shout at them, unless they're hitting our mother, stay calm. I'm genuinely lost",1,1771329462.0,family,2,1.0,False

*If you can't see the text correctly (all in one block), go out of the post, and click the text, not the photo.   

Here's [part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/fragranceclones/s/GsMoQtm5zt), [part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/fragranceclones/s/r8fni1Sxqp), [part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/fragranceclones/s/nNDN4FT3kK), and [part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/fragranceclones/s/Tb3EafyuKd).    

*All decants are 10-12 weeks old, and the bottles they came from are *who knows* how old. So all aged enough.   

**PLEASE READ THIS Disclosure**: This isn't a full review of each one. Full reviews in my profile. Go into my profile, tap the search bar, and write the name of the fragrance. You'll find my full review on it. My reviews are very thorough.  

**Preface**: while I'm a clone advocate, I am not a shill, and will never claim they're all ""1:1"". All of you probably already saw me making fun of people who say ""CDNIM is just like Aventus"". No, not even remotely the same. But because most of my comparisons to OG's come from memory of me testing them in a store, and not applying them along with the clone, each on a different wrist... I didn't fully earn the right to make that distinction with 100% accuracy. Fortunately, I saw ScentsWithSense has decant packages that include the OGs+clones, so I decided ""let's do this. Let's show people that clones can be just as good, but you need to filter through LOTS of hyped/shilled crap to know what's REALLY good and close to 1:1"". These battles will be rated differently, so please take notice.  

This is a well loved profile, that I just ""like"", not ""love"". A very complex and hard to describe profile. It's fruity and sweet, but also earthy (patchouli) and coffee injected... And of course, a bit boozy. 

I'm this review, because it's my first time reviewing the profile, you'll get both a full scoring AND a comparison scoring!  



**Closeness to OG**: They're only about 75% close, but I actually PREFER Nebula! 
The patchouli in nebula is less earthy and a bit more chocolaty, the whisky note is a bit sweeter (less alcoholic), and the malt is less sharp. My wife thinks they're only 50% similar, and was repulsed by the OG, while she enjoyed Nebula. I actually enjoy both.   

**Quality Differences**: Not as high as I thought they'd be. Maybe 15% better for the OG, with very slightly more blend depth and note separation. This is very surprising for me, as Mugler is one of those designers I love the most.  

**Performance difference**: Both are good performers. But there's about 10% advantage to the OG.

**Subjective Scent Score**: OG 8.1. Nebula 8.5.  
 **Longevity**: OG 10 hours, Nebula 8-9 hours.   
 **Projection**: OG medium-strong for 1-2 hours, then a medium scent bubble for another 2-3 hours, and skin scent only at hour 6. Deduct 30-60 minutes from these for Nebula.  
 **Blind buy safety score**: 7.8. it's a unique profile, but not *very* challenging even for the average newbie nose.  
 **Unisex Score (0=fem, 5=unisex, 10=Male)**: Both 7.0  
 **Versatility Score**: 6.5. winter-fall only, but good for almost any occasion you'll throw at it.    
 **Blend Quality Score**: OG 8.1 (designer quality, not higher than entry designer like Paco or Azzaro and such), Nebula 7.3 (above average clone quality).  
 **Value Score**: OG 1.5. Discontinued and now cost $180 instead of $50-$60. Nebula 9.8. $15 for a tester bottle on Jomashop right now, and you get above average quality and performance. Can't ask for a better value than that.   
 **Should cost**: OG $50-$60. Nebula $23-$27.  
 **Bottle design**: OG 8.0. Nebula 6.0.  
 **Atomizer Score**: N/A  
 **Conclusion**: Now I REALLY need to try Posh Malt, as that one is supposed to be better than Nebula.

Thoughts?,"I’ve had this instructor since January last year. She cancelled my first test saying she was unwell, had headaches or something. I thought ok, fair enough it happens. Second test was fine but the amount of times she’s cancelled or rescheduled is ridiculous. She cancels like half an hour or an hour before my test. I asked them to pick me up from a car park and was stood there like a fool for 15 mins before I noticed she’s messaged me sorry can’t make it with a reason I won’t say but again I thought fair enough. 

But when we have lessons she’s sat on her mobile not really saying anything. They even take calls with friends and so I have to assume we’re going straight on. Then I make a mistake and she starts shouting “what are you doing????” Lessons length has also annoyed me. She only does an hour lessons and almost half of it is spent driving the previous pupil home. Like yeah I can do some good driving in half an hour but I’ve paid for an hour and I’ve seen other instructors who only offer 2 hour lessons. It feels like she’s trying to get as much money as possible. 

What annoyed me more was they have other commitments which I first thought fair enough but it feels more and more like driving is second priority. They had me PULL INTO THEIR HOUSE so they could pick their dog up for a vet appointment. I was like ffs why not book the appointment at a time that’s more convenient. Trying to focus on driving with a whining dog in the back was so infuriating like what if I was allergic to dogs😭 I know a bit extreme but still. They’ve also had me pull into their house just so they can use the loo. First time I thought yeah ok it happens but then I’m like why not schedule breaks to allow for getting fuel or bathroom breaks or lunch or whatever. 

My instructor has had me pull into the Maccies drive thru so many times for a coffee or the best one was when they went in to use the loo and came out 15 mins later with a hot chocolate. 

What broke me was today, didn’t think I was ready for the test but she convinced me that yes I was ready. Personally, one hour a week assuming it wasn’t cancelled wasn’t enough I felt. Unless that’s the norm???? My instructor turned up 20 mins late saying traffic was bad I thought right ok, then we had to get fuel. I thought ffs go the night before for fuel.

I love Santa Muerte, i genuinely love her and will be forever grateful for her, i look up to her as a mother and a best friend, recently with my mental health and with it being winter i’ve been very unmotivated so i’ve been late with getting Santisima’s fresh water and coffee and daily prayers, which i know isn’t great, but the biggest problem for me lately has been intrusive/impulsive thoughts, i sat down at the altar recently with Santisima and apologised for being late most days and for slacking and i talked to her about how much i love her and that me being late isn’t because i love her any less, that these last two years of getting to know and love her have been the best, and after that long talk i felt so connected to Santisima, genuinely so deeply connected, but for a while i’ve been having intrusive or impulsive thoughts, which i’ve never experienced before and they’re always surrounding Santisima, i know some people might think “how can you think something by accident” but i don’t even try to think these thoughts, they genuinely cause me so much distress, these are thoughts that literally pop into my head when I’m thinking about Santa Muerte or even just thinking about praying or going to the altar, things i do not purposefully think or things i would ever think, i genuinely love and care for Santa Muerte so deeply, and am in this for life, i love her, the thoughts are things like cussing or stuff like that in my mind when I’m thinking about her, i have never dealt with intrusive thoughts before and i would NEVER speak to Santisima like that, it’s to the point where it distresses me, and i think about medicating myself so they don’t happen, i blame myself for the thoughts because they’ve been happening so long and i have no past experience with intrusive thoughts, when it happens i’m not scared of “being punished” for them, i’m scared of pushing Santisima away, because i really do blame myself for the thoughts since they’re in my mind, i can’t stress this enough, these are things i would \*never\* so much as think about Santisima or say to/about her, when i go to the altar and pray or apologise i just feel worse because they’re still happening and it’s like apologising for something that i’m not changing but i don’t know how to navigate them, I just don’t want to push Santisima away with these thoughts, when i prayed to her recently about it, i told her that i’m worried about upsetting her or pushing her away, there’s no part of me that would ever intentionally think these things, i’m not scared of being punished for them, i just care for and love her so much and would never do anything to upset her",2,1771329222.0,SantaMuerte,1,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )

and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.

The centers of decision-making are not in Ljubljana, nor are they truly in the hands of the people. The agenda is shaped elsewhere, under the influence of central banking structures that determine the direction regardless of which party is in government.

Anyone who believes that changing political parties through elections will significantly transform the system does not understand how deeply that system is entrenched.

That is why our path is different.

Spread LANA. Become LANAcoin Knights. Develop yourself through Lana8Wonder.

When more than 50% of us stand together, we will be able to assume authority legitimately through elections. There will be no need for televised debates. No need for coalition compromises. The majority will be clear, unified, and independent.

Until then, our focus must remain clear: expanding LANAcoin.

If you choose to vote, treat it as entertainment — like filling out a lottery ticket. If you must cast a ballot, do it casually on your way to Sunday coffee. But your real vote is cast every day when you spread LANA. That is where your power lies. That is where your decision truly matters.

LANAcoin is not merely a currency. It is an alternative to the central banking system.

It is a path toward financial sovereignty and individual responsibility.

Your true vote is cast when you contribute to the growth of the LANA community.

I’ve got a 2014 S6 that I’ve been chasing codes on for a week now. Long story short, I got a deal on the car knowing it had this issue, from an auction. The car was dumped on its face at auction, clearly bad front bags, so u replaced. This was confirmed when lifting the car & audibly hearing the leak blah blah blah. After words I calibrated the system, and it seems to sit fine now. 

However every morning when I leave, it get the codes above. Once I drive 13 mile to my coffee spot, restarting the car seems to clear the fault on the dash. This has been consistent, everyday, all week long. If I clear with VCDS it’ll stay out all day & wont return until the next morning. My compressor works, the valve block looks squeaky clean & there are no leaks that I’ve found by spraying soapy water on my he various suspension parts. 

Now, I do park on an incline, everyday at my home. I’ve read that this could be an issue, although I personally doubt it is but also haven’t tried otherwise yet. On a tender the battery reads 12.3 volts and that’s after driving 23 miles into work. My voltage to the supply block is sporadic via VCDS, I’m talking 0-14-1.5-14.6 etc. Where as voltage everywhere else seems normal. If the cars on the ground (this is all in auto drive mode also) and I raise it the voltage seems to hold at 14v but once it’s raised it goes back to being sporadic.

Now removing the trunk components to access the battery I clearly can see that someone has been in there as the hold down bolts were just laying in the spare tire well, and there are non factory nuts holding the pressure tank in place. 

If anyone’s bought from auction, cars die all the time, are jump started etc. I live in a cold climate where the lows right now are 13° F. I’m now onto thinking voltage is a problem & that maybe after sitting all night in the cold weather, the car isn’t getting enough voltage to run the suspension system properly & starts throwing codes\^ 

I feel as though I’ve checked everything else. It’s a Georgia car, so the sensors were all in good shape, none were stuck, eliminated it having a leak somewhere. Calibration didn’t seem to fix it, although it was way out of spec from sitting on its face.

At a lose here, not sure where to go next. If anymore information is needed I’m sure I can provide, just looking to see if anyone else has delt with this",0,1771329024.0,Audi,2,0.5,False

Her first landing was in **Mumbai**, where she somehow ended up as an extra in a Bollywood remake of *Speed* on day one (because… India 😂). After that she traveled across the country — from beaches to mountains to coffee estates — and kept realizing she’d barely scratched the surface.

Some takeaways that hit hard:

**1) You WILL feel overwhelmed (and that’s normal)**  
Especially in big cities like **Delhi** or Mumbai — traffic chaos, nonstop noise, crowds, smells, colors everywhere. It’s sensory overload.

**2) Culture shock is real**  
Even experienced travelers get it. The advice wasn’t to hide in your hotel or run to McDonald’s, but to lean into curiosity instead — explore food, art, neighborhoods, conversations.

**3) There is no “one India”**  
Different languages, religions, landscapes, lifestyles — it’s more like many countries packed into one. She quoted writer **Shashi Tharoor** saying you can only speak of India in the plural.

**4) Expect the unexpected**  
From Tibetan settlements to French colonial towns to Himalayan deserts — every region feels like a different world.

Honestly, as someone planning a trip (or just fascinated by the country), this made me realize preparation isn’t about itineraries — it’s about mindset.

If you’ve been to India:

**What’s something you wish you knew before going?**  
Or what shocked you the most when you first arrived?

Would love to hear stories — good, bad, chaotic, magical.

obviously just spitballing instead of writing actual prose, but moments like this when characters are thinking about or discussing a past event gets flagged as a lapse or ""needing to decide between present and past tense"" when the rest of the work is clearly written *in* present tense, and is made clear that the event being described is *not* happening in the present. like, i'm not sure what they expected. writing ""one time he does XYZ"" is grammatically and contextually incorrect, even if it's consistent with present tense.

are you just not supposed to do this ***ever*** or am i getting people who just aren't reading closely enough? the thing that puzzles me is, not everyone complains about this...",4,1771328601.0,writing,9,0.75,False

I won’t go into my long backstory of insomnia, but basically, I’ve been on trazodone for 10+ years and overall it’s worked well. A little over four years ago, in the middle of grad school, I stopped being able to sleep more than 2-3 hours a night. I’d fall asleep fine, but then wake up. My psychiatrist put me on Klonopin with no real guidance, and I ended up becoming dependent to the point of tolerance. I had to move back home and didn’t finish my grad program until last year.

It used to be that my problem never was falling asleep, but rather staying asleep. That’s changed in the last few years. My nights of bad sleep aren’t happening quite as often (although my sleep isn’t where I’d want it to ideally be), but now I have nights when I struggle to fall asleep until the wee hours of the morning, or—like this past night—I just don’t sleep at all. Even with 100mg trazodone, plus melatonin, plus magnesium. Last winter I was awake for two whole nights, which was terrifying (I even posted about it here). I managed to get myself out of that spiral thankfully. 

Something else I now struggle with is the ability to fall asleep anywhere that’s not my bed at home. I’ve had multiple restless nights at friends’ houses and hotels. This really puts a damper on things, because I enjoy roadtrips and exploring and being with friends, but not at the expense of my sleep.

I guess this post is part rant, part reassurance seeking, part wondering if anyone has any advice. I’m frustrated and scared. I’m off to work after a night of no sleep with my coffee and a prayer. Tonight I’ll have to take my trusty hydroxyzine, which will knock me out cold but leave me with a hangover for two days. I wish this wasn’t my life.",1,1771328205.0,insomnia,0,1.0,False

1r73mll,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dads/comments/1r73mll/couvade_syndrome/,Couvade Syndrome?,"Hello all,

 A couple of weeks ago I started to notice my abdomen would hurt on my left side. Went to urgent care, they determined I was constipated even though I was still going atleast twice a day. I went back a few days later as the pain was still there and they gave me antibiotics for dysuria which I did not have. 

A week later I was instructed by my PCP (VA) to go to the ER if symptoms didn't improve. I went Monday to which they did a CT of my abdomen showing I was constipated even though I was regular and stated everything looks good even my labs. I hadn't slept Sunday night and took melatonin after the ER visit and slept a little Monday night. Felt great Tuesday so I went for a run as I am usually a pretty healthy and active person and felt great. Went for a walk in the evening with my wife and started to have a panic attack because I was overthinking about the Metamucil I took to which I have never struggled with anxiety and or had any mental health issues at all. Went to the ER again on Wednesday as I had chest pains and the EKG and chest X-ray were all good and showed no bad signs. That Friday I slept great but I had noticed that throughout the whole week I would either fall asleep and then awaken in the middle of the night or have a hard time falling asleep and then pass out but both instances I would be sweaty and heart racing and my mind on thoughts of my own health.

Fast forward a week and my sleep has improved a touch as I started to take Zzzquil and noticed that has helped to get me to sleep and stay asleep. Now it seems as though I cannot enjoy the foods I wouldn't normally think twice about as I have diarrhea most days and last night my stomach kept me up for most of the night. I usually drink beer on the weekends but have had to limit myself to 1 or 2 as im unsure if it'll make my sleep and stomach worse. I usually have 2 cups of coffee black in the am with no issues in the past but now have struggled to find my normal food and beverage likes.

I state all of this as I have never had such issues at all and they started when my wife was around 22 weeks pregnant and she is now about 25 weeks pregnant. Im genuinely curious to see if any of you have experienced these issues with Couvade Syndrome or if its something bigger. This will be our first child and im a 33 year old male. It just sucks as I want to be the best version of myself to support my wife and our soon to be child and it is a challenge to do that while all of this is ongoing. Any help and support is welcome. Thanks. ",2,1771328023.0,Dads,1,1.0,False

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

We had a very robust, free-flowing conversation and both achieved what we wanted to, however she commented as we were leaving about how I seemed distracted during the conversation. I was really taken aback and couldn’t get anything out to defend (?) myself before she said something else entirely unrelated. 

I’m feeling a bit shaken by this, it’s never been something that has been brought up by anyone before. I don’t want to have to ‘perform stillness’ because that will completely dominate my focus. Just looking for solidarity, thoughts or advice. Thanks!",10,1771327693.0,AuDHDWomen,2,0.92,False

I sit in the 1/2 game for the table minimum $60 (bankroll management or something) and greet the dealer that has been dealing me for 15 years: “Good morning, Mike!”

My buddy George is already there. We discuss weather patterns and knee pain while I patiently wait for good holdings.
First orbit:

- 88 UTG? Small pair, out of position, fold

- QJo on the button? Not suited, can’t make high hand, fold

- 87s in the BB facing a $6 raise? Too expensive for 8 high, fold

You can’t just play hands in poker. That’s how they get you.

After about an hour I finally picked up a real holding: A8o. It has an ace so it is a good hand to limp with. I limp from early position for pot control. A young maniac raises to $10. But I have an ace, so I call. Pot odds or something.

We go 5-ways to a flop: A 9 2 

Top pair. Time to protect it. I immediately jam my remaining $45. Everyone snap folds. Perfect result. I win the pot without letting them catch up. I am now up $25 (from $60 to $85). I start racking up to lock the win for the day. No need to gamble. bankroll management.

While racking, I’m dealt one last hand: AA. Unbelievable. I limp from early position to be sneaky, they’ll never suspect I have aces because I limped. The same young maniac makes it $10 again. Action gets back to me. I say “well, I was gonna go home anyway” and jam all-in. Table sighs. I think someone said “here we go again.”. Everyone folds. Exactly what I wanted. I’d rather win a small pot than let my aces get cracked. You just have to win the pot before they get lucky.

I cash out and head home. See everyone tomorrow at 8.

1r73cv9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Beatmatch/comments/1r73cv9/first_gig_report_i_cant_believe_how_much_the/,First gig report. I can't believe how much the crowd loved exploring different genres!,"TL;DR: Sunday 11am coffee bar gig. Was advertised as a ""daytime rave"", whatever that is. I prepared a bunch of different genres and set out to play whatever made sense once I saw the crowd. Spent 2 hours exploring different genres to what must've been the most welcoming crowd in the world. 

I was ready 30 minutes early and began testing some tunes early (with permission from bar staff, they were happy to start). Tested out everything from funky-bassy tracks to downtempo, people just vibed with all. Great. The crowd was a mix of all ages between 20 and 50 having their morning coffee.

Around 11am, as the bar started to fill up, I settled for some upbeat house tunes which I played for around 45 minutes. At this point there were around 30 people in the bar, 20 of which were on the dance floor. The place is small, so it was completely packed. The vibe was solid for the first 45 minutes or so; then as I felt the crowd's energy levels decreasing, I decided to change it up a bit.

I played [Waxcap - DjRUM ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQtvKD-h7bs)at this point because it creates great suspense, allows dancers to catch their breath, and breaks off into a nice DnB vibe bringing the dancers right back into it. It worked like a charm, exactly as I imagined it'd work. When it started off, the piano intro got them curious, and as the track built up tension I could feel the crowd's hype for the drop. I hadn't mixed in any DnB up until that point, so when the drop hit, the crowd went nuts. What an epic moment. This track does this exactly twice: slow, drum-less buildup and drop into DnB. The second time it happened, the crowd knew what to expect and welcomed the drop with some more dancing. What a moment. 

I continued with a couple of acid house tunes and was surprised to feel the crowd wanting something harder. Tried out [Villalobos' Dexter (Kollektiv Turmstrasse's remix)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y385G_wn60I), a personal favorite of mine and got to see some people experience it (presumably) for the first time. I remember discovering this tune and how much I felt it back then. Glad some others felt it the same way. In hindsight, I wish I'd played the original version of the track, but I was afraid the sound system lacked the depth needed to feel the track properly. Regardless, it wasn't the right selection for this moment, but not terrible either.

Wanting to go brighter but still hard, I took a risk with.. psy-techno of all things and got a bunch of stank faces back. This was an interesting point. While the crowd got noticeably more engaged with the harder stuff, I also saw a couple of people leaving, presumably because psy-techno was too much for them on a Sunday 12h00. Can't blame them tbh. 

With the crowd's engagement but the need cool off, I pulled up some organic downtempo tracks. [Be Svendsen's Day 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAeuYlc2gQk) kept the stank faces going while taking the noise down a notch. Spent the next half hour playing a mix between organic downtempo and acid house.

  
I finished off with a joke track: [Bo Burnham's FaceTime with My Mom (Tonight)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChgFo74WxZ8). The reaction was mixed; I think surprisingly few people knew the track and it didn't land very well. This was probably the worst track selection of my set.

  
The amount of genre change sounds unreasonable here. I never planned to do it this much, but I swear the crowd loved it! After the way Waxcap landed, the crowd trusted me with the genre changes. After 3/4 tracks of a genre, changing genre really captured their attention. Genre change made the set about the music, about the expectation and discovery, and the crowd was actively engaged and listening for most of the set.

Got a bunch of compliments at the end. The top two being:

1. ""Thanks for the DjRUM!"" and  
2. ""That was a musical JOURNEY!""

I still can't believe how great this felt!",3,1771327122.0,Beatmatch,4,1.0,False

My local café is a bit far for a daily morning coffee, so I'm looking to set up at home. I've narrowed it down to Breville but not sure which model to go for — would love to hear what's worked for you.

My main question though: can you actually get café-quality results at home? I appreciate good coffee and I'm willing to put in the time to learn and dial things in, but I wonder if there's a ceiling with home machines vs commercial gear. Has anyone made the jump and been happy with the results?

I’m a 2nd-year Biomedical Engineering student from Vietnam, currently visiting Singapore. I’ve been following SUTD for a while and I think the people here and the vibe that this school gives off is very inspiring to me. It’s exactly the kind of environment I’ve been looking for. I'm planning to drop by the campus for a solo tour soon.

A couple of questions i want to ask:

1. Is there a store or place where visitors can buy SUTD-branded merchandise? I want to grab a little something to “manifest” my dream of coming back here for my future studies. If there is, where should I head to?
2. Since I’m here alone. I’d love to connect with anyone interested in BME, Robotics, or Mechatronics…  I’m a big hardware geek and currently working with custom PCBs and embedded systems. I’m really curious about the maker culture at SUTD and would love to hear about the projects you guys are building here! (人´З\`)

If you're free to grab a coffee at the campus or just want to chat about engineering and life in Singapore, please let me know! It would be great to make some new friends here.

Thx alot guys!

About a year ago I posted here about skipping my best friend’s US destination wedding because it would have cost me and my boyfriend around 4–5k, which just wasn’t financially realistic for us.

Here’s the **original post** for context: [https://www.reddit.com/r/bridezillas/comments/1ff2gau/should\_i\_feel\_guilty\_for\_skipping\_my\_friends/](https://www.reddit.com/r/bridezillas/comments/1ff2gau/should_i_feel_guilty_for_skipping_my_friends/)

I wanted to update because I genuinely don’t know if I lost one of my closest friendships over this.

**For background:** We all live in Paris. She’s American, big family, wedding in a beautiful wine region near where her parents live. Very aesthetic, very Instagram, very curated. The groom is French. My boyfriend actually introduced them years ago.

We weren’t casual friends. We were see-each-other-every-other-day friends. Wine nights. Random weekday dinners. Group chats constantly. Trips. Real-life closeness.

When the US wedding was announced, I did the math. Between flights, hotels, activities (boat day, wine tours, etc.), it would have been close to 4–5k for us if we stayed a week. That’s a huge amount of money for us. And the entire Paris friend group felt the same. No one here has family in the US to combine it with.

Before the US wedding, she came to us with a big bouquet and a bottle of wine and asked us to be bridesmaid and groomsman. It was filmed. Very emotional. Very “moment.” The thing is, I had already told her it was almost impossible for us to go. It felt like being emotionally cornered on camera. We didn’t say no in that moment because… how do you? It was awkward. But a few days later I met her alone and told her clearly we couldn’t commit because of money. We wouldn’t be able to travel or do anything else that year if we went. She brushed it off. “Yeah I know.”But something shifted.

**Important detail:** before the US wedding, we organized and fully paid for a Portugal stag/hen weekend for both of them. It was amazing. We put effort, money, time into celebrating them. So it’s not like we didn’t show up in other ways.

Then, 2 months later, came the small French wedding (yes, we got the invite!). It was beautiful. Intimate. So fun. But she was different. Distant. Polite. Surface level. Not the person I used to sit with for hours talking about everything.

Now it’s been about 6-7 months since that wedding. I’ve maybe seen her 5 times.

Every time the group tries to meet, she makes excuses. Or insists we come all the way to their place (45 minutes outside Paris) instead of just meeting centrally where all of us live. It feels like a subtle barrier.

Meanwhile, she messages my boyfriend weekly for work advice. “Let’s meet soon!” texts. Professional warmth. But with me? It’s cold. How’s work. How’s life. End of conversation.

I’ve tried reaching out. A few “let’s get a coffee and chat” messages. Always “yes soon!” but it never happens. After a while, I stop chasing.

And I can’t help but feel like I didn’t fit into the wedding storyline she imagined. The American bridesmaids flew in, the Instagram content happened, the dream aesthetic was fulfilled. The Paris girls didn’t. Did we get quietly downgraded?

I don’t know if she consciously resents us for not going. Or if weddings just reorganize people’s emotional priorities. But it feels like I lost someone who used to be one of my closest friends and that makes me really sad. Am I overthinking this? Did I underestimate how much not going would hurt her? Or is this just what happens when expectations don’t match reality?",125,1771326980.0,bridezillas,24,0.98,False

1r73adh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticAdults/comments/1r73adh/dealing_with_mess_and_chores/,Dealing with mess and chores,"I've been having some issues with my partner recently due to levels of mess in the house and 'pulling their weight'. 

I really benefit from systems and routines, including in the household such as certain things living in their home and needing a baseline level of cleanliness. This is something that brings sense to my life and I can easily communicate the importance and impact of my house being 'in order'. I'm not the tidiest person myself so not every single bit of mess bothers me, but there's a level that contributes to my psychological wellbeing.

My partner is suspected ADHD. We do feel this plays into their ability to maintain levels of tidiness - namely the ability to forget that things exist and time management. I understand that this is likely how their brain works, however there have been times where the mess gets so overwhelming. For example... 

\- Toothpaste cap left off or toothpaste taken in shower so it gets watery (I've asked multiple times for this not to happen)

\- Crumbs/coffee beans all over the kitchen counters after they make toast/coffee

\- Packets not being put in the bins, sweet wrappers randomly scattered about

\- Never scooping/cleaning cat litter boxes

\- Leaving plates and mugs on the floor (I hate this because we have a kitten)

\- Not cleaning off toothbrush and letting brown gunk get all over the bathroom cabinets

\- Leaving clothes wherever they're taken off. Socks currently in living room, cap in our bathroom

\- Not rinsing out recycling/leaving it for me to do

\- Putting empty jars back in the cupboard

  
One that's really weird - they moved our bins into the kitchen to empty them. Then they didn't bother moving one of them back. They just started using it as a regular bin... even though there's the kitchen bin DIRECTLY behind it. I found it disgusting tbh.

We have a chores chart in our kitchen and every major housework task was last completed by me except one. 

I'm at a loss and it's putting a strain on our relationship. I find it hard to just accept it's the ADHD, as it's completely unmanaged. I've said many times that I understand they can't help how their brain works, but that doesn't mean just letting it go unchecked. Especially if you're hurting your SO by doing so. I've proposed and implemented some systems but it feels like I have to fix it for them.

I don't know if I just have high standards, and if it's even valid for me to have these complaints. They tell me that I'm too inflexible due to being autistic and that most people would just pick up after others, no complaints. I've said to them that it's not fair to expect me to lower what I'm comfortable with since it's important to me, but they say that people in relationships are willing to overlook these things out of love.

I don't feel like that's true? I don't know if anyone else is told that their standards are too high in this regard? How do you cope with it? Am I wrong for being upset? Am I being excessive?

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Photo: State Department \/ Freddie Everett](https://preview.redd.it/t10alqpyc1kg1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=0308ffa556c91d40b9f197317fe65c5d3d50ba5e)

The Trump administration is pushing to build a 55-country critical minerals alliance to coordinate supply and pricing for niche metals vital to technology and defense. The initiative aims to reduce reliance on China, but Beijing remains confident that it will still dominate the market for years to come.

Speaking at the Munich Security Conference on February 14, United States Secretary of State Marco Rubio [called](https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2026/02/secretary-of-state-marco-rubio-at-the-munich-security-conference/) on allies to form a coordinated framework to secure supplies of rare earths and other strategic minerals, claiming some nations used subsidies to undercut Western producers.

He argued that the end of the Cold War in 1991 created a “dangerous delusion” that Western-style liberal democracy was inevitable worldwide.

“The euphoria of this triumph led us to a dangerous delusion: that we had entered ‘the end of history’, that every nation would now be a liberal democracy, that the ties formed by trade and by commerce alone would now replace nationhood, that the rules-based global order, an overused term, would now replace the national interest and that we would now live in a world without borders where everyone became a citizen of the world,” he said. 

Rubio said the West embraced a dogmatic vision of free and unfettered trade even as some countries protected their economies and subsidized companies to undercut Western industries, forcing factory closures, deindustrialization, the loss of working- and middle-class jobs overseas and the transfer of control over critical supply chains to adversaries and rivals.

Rubio urged European countries to join the US in building a Western supply chain for critical minerals that would not be vulnerable to coercion from other powers. He said such cooperation would allow the West to regain control of its industries and supply chains and prosper in sectors set to define the 21st century.

He said the West must form a reinvigorated alliance that does not outsource, constrain or subordinate its power to systems beyond its control and does not depend on others for the critical necessities of its national life.

Throughout his speech, Rubio did not overtly mention China, as he also avoided doing at the 2026 Critical Minerals Ministerial conference on February 4. Rubio, joined by US Vice President JD Vance and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, [hosted](https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2026/02/opening-remarks-of-the-critical-minerals-ministerial) representatives from 54 countries and the European Commission, including 43 foreign and other ministers, at the conference in Washington. 

“Mining is less glamorous than building computers, cars or airplanes. But building computers and cars and airplanes is also less glamorous than designing them,” Rubio said on February 4. “As we embraced what was new and glamorous, we outsourced what seemed old and unfashionable.”

“And then one day we woke up and we realized we had outsourced our economic security and our very future. We were at the mercy of whoever controlled supply chains for these minerals,” he said.

David Copley, special assistant to the US president and senior director for global supply chains, said at the conference that Washington had been investing in mining projects, stockpiling minerals, protecting domestic mining companies and rebuilding its mining ecosystem.

The US [said](https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2026/02/2026-critical-minerals-ministerial) it signed new bilateral critical minerals frameworks and memorandums of understanding (MOUs), announced US government financing opportunities to support strategic minerals projects and celebrated the launch of the Forum on Resource Geostrategic Engagement, or FORGE, a new platform to coordinate allied policy and investment in strategic minerals.

On February 2, President Donald Trump [announced](https://www.whitehouse.gov/videos/introducing-project-vault-a-critical-mineral-stockpile-for-american-businesses-%F0%9F%92%8E%F0%9F%87%BA%F0%9F%87%B8/) Project Vault, led by the chairman of the US Export‑Import Bank (EXIM), to create a domestic reserve of critical minerals. The EXIM board approved a direct loan of up to $10 billion to shield manufacturers from supply shocks and expand US production and processing.

# Chinese calm

While Washington pushes to build a rare‑earth alliance, Beijing has so far remained calm. China currently holds about 60% of the global niche-metals market.

“An open, inclusive international trade environment beneficial to all serves the common interests of all countries,” Lin Jian, a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, [said](https://www.mfa.gov.cn/eng/xw/fyrbt/lxjzh/202602/t20260205_11851974.html) on February 5. “All parties have the responsibility to play a constructive role in keeping the global industrial and supply chains of critical minerals stable and secure.”

Lin said China opposes any country setting up exclusive blocs to disrupt the international economic and trade order.

Some Chinese commentators said the proposed 55‑country alliance could prove fragile, arguing many participants would be reluctant to give up access to China’s market even if they joined the bloc. They pointed to Argentina as a recent example illustrating the tensions facing countries balancing Western initiatives with economic ties to China.

“Washington had not expected cracks to appear so quickly after the Critical Minerals Ministerial conference on February 4,” a columnist at the state‑owned Shangqiu Times [wrote](https://baijiahao.baidu.com/s?id=1856979697387729190&wfr=spider&for=pc) on February 15. “Argentina said its critical minerals agreement signed with the US does not exclude Chinese investment. This punctures the illusion of an exclusive alliance.”

“As a major lithium producer, Argentina counts China as its second‑largest trading partner and a key investor in energy, lithium and infrastructure projects worth billions of dollars,” the writer said, adding that Argentina’s stance [reflected](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/argentinas-minerals-deal-with-us-does-not-rule-out-chinese-investment-minister-2026-02-06/) pragmatic national interests.

“In today’s deeply interconnected global economy, no country can develop independently of China’s manufacturing ecosystem,” he added. “Resource‑rich countries, especially in Latin America, see stable cooperation with China as a necessity, not a choice. Some European countries have also signaled reluctance to commit to US supply chains that fully bypass China, given the uncertainty surrounding long‑term US financial commitments.”

A Shaanxi‑based columnist writing under the pen name “Starry Night” says South Korea was pursuing a dual‑track strategy despite hosting the alliance discussions.

“As a US ally and chair of the new alliance, South Korea plans to set up a critical minerals hotline with China to ensure continued imports of key raw materials from China,” [sa](https://baijiahao.baidu.com/s?id=1856758664860859589&wfr=spider&for=pc)id the writer. “This reflects a balance between political alignment and economic interests.”

“Market realities make Washington’s strategy difficult,” he says. “China controls about 60% of global rare‑earth mining and more than 90% of processing, while around 70% of US rare‑earth imports in recent years have relied on China. These structural facts cannot be changed by a few meetings or agreements. The US may need 10 to 20 years to build a fully independent supply chain.”

# Countercurrent extraction technology

Public data show that China holds about 34% of global rare‑earth reserves but accounts for roughly 92% of output and more than 80% of heavy rare-earth supply. Across mining, smelting and deep processing, China maintains a dominant influence, with over 90% of global smelting and separation capacity concentrated in the country.

A writer at China Mining Club [noted](https://finance.sina.com.cn/roll/2026-02-05/doc-inhkuccm3005091.shtml) China’s strategic advantage lies in midstream separation and refining, a complex system that combines chemical engineering and production management.

“China’s countercurrent extraction technology allows multiple purification cycles at a fraction of overseas costs,” he wrote. “In deep processing, advanced magnet technologies and other innovations have secured a leading global position.”

He said that China holds about 222,000 of the world’s 470,000 rare‑earth patents, describing the technological moat as the result of four to five decades of development that cannot be overcome quickly through US policy announcements.

The latest moves by Washington to build a strategic reserve of critical minerals followed a [report](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2026/01/adjusting-imports-of-processed-critical-minerals-and-their-derivative-products-into-the-united-states/) submitted to Trump last October by US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, which said processed critical minerals and their derivative products are essential to US national security.

The report highlighted a wide industrial reliance on critical minerals:

* The chemical sector uses lithium, fluorite and bromine for synthesis and industrial processes.
* The communications sector uses gallium, germanium, indium and yttrium in fiber‑optic networks and satellite systems.
* The energy sector relies on cobalt, nickel, uranium, praseodymium and terbium for battery storage, nuclear fuel, generators and electric‑vehicle motors.

The report said that, as of 2024, the US was 100% net-import-reliant for 12 critical minerals and at least 50% net-import-reliant for another 29. It added that even where domestic mining exists, including cobalt and nickel, the country lacks sufficient processing capacity to avoid downstream import dependence.

Trump said on January 14 that he would take necessary measures to adjust rare‑earth imports and eliminate related threats to national security.

https://preview.redd.it/m097sotbrwjg1.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=079eb9becd585d09e969a296dd4393a9a98be9d2

President [Donald Trump](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/tag/donald-trump/)'s new [critical minerals](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/tag/critical-minerals/) stockpile is aimed at safeguarding the U.S. supply chain from market disruptions, furthering the administration's push to bolster domestic supply chains and reduce reliance on [China](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/tag/china/). 

China controls the global supply of critical minerals and has used it as leverage against the United States and other countries by imposing restrictions on exports of rare-earth minerals needed for build applications in the energy and defense sectors. 

As part of a broad effort to address supply chain vulnerabilities, the White House last week announced ""Project Vault,"" a new critical mineral stockpile. Here's what to know about it. 

# What is the stockpile?

The purpose of Project Vault is to ensure there is uninterrupted access to critical minerals for industry during market disruptions and to reduce reliance on foreign supply chains. 

The stockpile is similar to the U.S.'s existing crude oil stockpile, known as the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which is considered the largest supply of emergency crude oil.

But rather than storing crude, the Project Vault stockpile would store minerals deemed ""critical"" by the Department of the Interior's U.S. Geological Survey. The department has listed [60 minerals](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy-and-environment/3877665/interior-department-critical-mineral-list-coal-copper/) as critical, including lithium, boron, copper, lead, and uranium. 

Dan McGroarty, a critical mineral consultant and member of the Graphite One advisory board, told the Washington Examiner that Project Vault underscores the need for metals and minerals not only for military use but also for advanced commercial technologies, data centers, artificial intelligence, and more.

The Department of Defense currently has the National Defense Stockpile, which reserves critical minerals and materials to reduce reliance on foreign sources for national security.

But, unlike the National Defense Stockpile, Project Vault would support industry, rather than the military, as it creates a public-private partnership. The project has brought more than a dozen major tech and manufacturing firms to purchase rare earths and minerals to fill the reserve, including General Motors, Stellantis, Boeing, GE Vernova, and Google. It is part of an effort to stabilize and mitigate prices to the supply chain during geopolitical disruptions.

The minerals will be sourced both at home and abroad. The minerals will also be stored in a network of warehouse facilities in the country.

Still, McGroarty noted that operating the stockpile will be a ""big challenge,"" as participants will need to identify which materials are critical and at what grade and volume. 

""If the vault is supposed to face and serve private companies and innovators. It should involve them in the conceptual phase that we're going to enter now ... so that they create a system and an inventory that is actually what the private sector entrepreneurs, innovators will actually need,"" McGroarty said. 

# Who is funding the stockpile?

The U.S. [Export-Import Bank](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/tag/export-import-bank/), which authorized the program, provided a $10 billion loan and nearly $2 billion in private capital to purchase and store critical minerals. 

Manufacturers participating in the program will make long-term commitments and pay a fee to access those minerals during times of maker disruptions. 

Eric Robinson, special counsel at Baker Botts, said the stockpile could offer the mineral industry a price guarantee for commercial offtake.

# Stockpile beneficeries

Trump has noted that the stockpile would benefit taxpayers because it would generate profit from interest on the loan used to start the program. 

The stockpile could benefit multiple groups, including taxpayers, Robinson of Baker Botts said. Since the financing is a loan from Ex-Im, he said, taxpayers should earn a return through interest payments. 

He added that companies receiving the loan would face lower borrowing costs, allowing them to build critical minerals stockpiles more affordably. Robinson said suppliers seeking commercial offtake agreements would also benefit, as more industry participants would have financial flexibility to make purchases. 

Anthony Huston, CEO of Graphite One, a mining company in Alaska, told the Washington Examiner that the benefit of Ex-Im offering nearly $12 billion in stockpile financing is essential for smaller companies that can't afford to ride out market disruptions. 

""It's a very impressive combination of a lot of time getting put into this by some very smart people that are looking at this as a long-term solution to a problem that's been occurring over the last 25 years,"" Huston said. 

# Market distortions

The stockpile is meant to ensure industries have access to minerals during market volatility, but it could inadvertently distort markets if not managed properly.

McGroarty said there will need to be careful thought given how they sell minerals 10 or 15 years later to ensure it doesn't distort the markets. He noted that the National Defense Stockpile sells materials that are no longer needed and receives funds to finance materials that are more in demand

""The vault will one day start to dispose of materials that it has bought, and that's going to have to be done very carefully or that could upend \[the\] market,” McGroarty said. “There are ways to do it well. And there are ways to do it without the fine grain.”

Robinson noted that the stockpile is ""absolutely"" designed to cause market distortions, adding that ""all of this federal lending causes market distortions."" 

""Everything we're seeing around this kind of programmatic is a deliberate market distortion. But it's deliberate market distortion that's supposed to be favorable for the American taxpayer, for the companies who are operating, and ultimately for the national security establishment,"" Robison said.

# Feb. 16th, 2026~The US is merely the latest to join the global rush to hoard critical minerals

[The US is merely the latest to join the global rush to hoard critical minerals | Critical minerals | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2026/feb/16/critical-minerals-shortages-jd-vance-trading-bloc-analysis)

[A farmer in the Democratic Republic of the Congo holds tantalum, one of the technology-critical minerals in short supply globally. Photograph: Kuni Takahashi\/Getty Images](https://preview.redd.it/he3rl35wbvjg1.png?width=3800&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3e95e9b029412ff74bb6e77d90c692a2be60af2)

The announcement by the US vice-president, JD Vance, that the country is seeking to create a new critical minerals “trading bloc” is a final, exotic, nail in the coffin of the old global trading system. The era of mass abundance, as supplied by unfettered free trade and global markets – “neoliberalism” – is over. We live in a new world of strategic competition between states over scarce but essential resources, with shocks to supplies from human activity and natural disasters an ever-present risk.

This means recalibrating how we think about our economy: the new economic fundamentals today are resource constraints and climate and nature crises, and these, rather than human activity, will increasingly shape the world we inhabit. Flows of finance and stocks of wealth will matter less than stocks and flows of real material resources.

There are two drivers of this shift. The first is the surge in demand for electricity across the globe. After a decade and more in which electricity demand in the developed world was stagnant or even falling, the last few years have seen an extraordinary resurgence in rich-world electricity demand – matching the continuing industrialisation and consumer booms of the fast-growing global south countries. The electrification of transport, and the [datacentre build-out powering artificial intelligence](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/dec/19/data-centers-ai-investment), along with continued strong demand for industrial production, are all at the cutting edge of shaping what the International Energy Agency calls a new “[Age of Electricity](https://www.iea.org/reports/electricity-2026)”.

For the first time since the Industrial Revolution, demand for coal, the filthiest of fossil fuels, is set to peak and then decline. “Peak coal” is being brought about by massive investments in renewable energy across the globe, led by China, which has seen renewable electricity overtake coal-generated for the first time. Even with rising demand, the IEA forecasts a cleaner future global electricity system. The transition is real – whatever Vance or Donald Trump may wish for.

But this transition, the product of deliberate choice by governments and investors, is only half the story. The other half is being forced on us by the Earth’s changing climate. As temperatures rise, [with last year yet again one of the warmest on record](https://wmo.int/news/media-centre/wmo-confirms-2025-was-one-of-warmest-years-record), so, too, has demand for airconditioning. This is adding major strains to electricity systems: at the height of the 2023 heatwave, factories in Sichuan province, China, were shuttered by its regional government [to preserve scarce electricity supplies for a sweltering population running their aircon units at full-tilt.](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/16/economy/sichuan-factories-power-crunch-china-heat-wave-intl-hnk) In India, [electricity demand surged 9% during 2024’s heatwaves](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/energy/heatwaves-drive-9-of-indias-electricity-demand-surge-in-2024-study-warns-of-deepening-heatpower-trap), forcing the country to lean more heavily into coal and gas generation – directly threatening progress on reducing emissions in a terrible example of climate blowback.

And that electric surge is reshaping the demand for raw materials. Below the Age of Electricity is an Age of Copper – and graphite, lithium, cobalt; neodymium for magnets; yttrium for smartphone screens; scandium, europium, tantalum … A kaleidoscope of rare earths and critical minerals that make the transition possible, but whose supplies across the world are limited, and increasingly jealously guarded.

If, for example, you want to build electric vehicles on a massive scale, you need batteries. And batteries, with current technologies, need lithium. World Bank projections suggest that global production of lithium must rise by 450% by 2050 to match projected demand. This is creating a bonanza for countries in the “Lithium Triangle” of Chile, Argentina and Bolivia, [where 75% of known global reserves are found](https://hir.harvard.edu/lithium-triangle/).

Electrical goods also need wiring. Demand for copper is already surging – but usable supply is lagging behind. [Copper prices surged 20% over 2025 to all-time highs](https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/global-research/commodities/copper-outlook), as demand raced ahead of supply, leaving a “copper deficit” of 200,000 tonnes. This imbalance is set to worsen. [S&P Global forecast a 10 million tonne “copper deficit” globally by 2040](https://press.spglobal.com/2026-01-08-Substantial-Shortfall-in-Copper-Supply-Widens-as-the-Race-for-AI-and-Growing-Defense-Spending-Add-to-Accelerating-Demand,-New-S-P-Global-Study-Finds).

It is decades of patient investment and deliberate policy that has led to China being in the dominant position across essential mineral supply chains. [Chinese companies control more than 50% of the globe’s refined copper production](https://discoveryalert.com.au/chinas-strategic-copper-processing-control-2025/), with four of the world’s largest smelters located inside the country. Chile, which has the world’s largest reserves of the metal, [produces around a quarter of the world’s unrefined copper](https://plusmining.com/en/2025/02/24/chiles-share-in-the-global-copper-market-drops-from-30-to-24-in-a-decade/), and [about three-quarters of this is sold to China](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/chinas-pursuit-copper-changing-latin-america-210171). Hefty investments in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are [projected to give Chinese firms control of 46% of the world’s cobalt supply by the end of this decade](https://source.benchmarkminerals.com/article/how-much-cobalt-production-is-owned-by-chinese-companies). China is the [dominant supplier of 19 out of 20 critical minerals surveyed by the International Energy Agency](https://www.iea.org/commentaries/with-new-export-controls-on-critical-minerals-supply-concentration-risks-become-reality), commanding 90% of global refining capacity in some cases.

It is this, above all else, that is concentrating minds in Washington. The pressure of competition for scarce but essential resources is forcing the US to ape its geopolitical rival. State ownership has become fashionable in the land of free enterprise: the US took equity stakes in five mining and refining companies last summer, [concentrated in critical minerals](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/11/17/investing/equity-stakes-government-stock-market), and is [arranging the government-backed buyout of 40% of Glencore’s cobalt-copper mines in DRC](https://www.mining.com/web/us-government-plans-new-mining-house-to-tap-africas-copperbelt/). Trump’s animosity to renewables isn’t only prejudice: the drive to “drill, baby, drill” at home, or the seizure of oil in Venezuela, is the self-interested US response to the creation of a Chinese “[electrostate](https://www.ft.com/content/e1a232c7-52a0-44dd-a13b-c4af54e74282)”.

But control of production is only part of the response. Control of existing stocks also matter, especially where there are real threats to fresh supplies. Leaks from China’s National Food and Strategic Reserves Administration last year detailed plans for the bureau, which oversees the country’s reserves of key commodities, from oil to pork bellies, to buy “[cobalt, copper, nickel and lithium](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-21/china-to-add-cobalt-copper-in-boost-to-state-metal-reserves)” and other metals. Total amounts bought, and current reserves held, are confidential, but estimates suggest that China’s stockpiles of industrial metals have ramped up significantly over years, and now come to [several million metric tonnes in total](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/what-china-keeps-its-secretive-commodity-reserves-2021-08-05/). Stockpiles of non-ferrous metals were boosted after the pandemic to take advantage of a price slump, [including a record purchase of 15,000 tonnes of cobalt](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/china-state-stockpiler-aims-buy-up-15000-t-cobalt-sources-say-2024-05-23/), essential for electronics, while significant purchases over the last 12 months almost certainly contributed to rising global prices.

Japan and South Korea both maintain similar[ robust](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/issue-brief/critical-minerals-in-crisis-stress-testing-us-supply-chains-against-shocks/) official metal stockpiles although on a smaller scale. [Resource-poor Japan established its rare metal stockpiling system as far back as 1983](https://www.questmetals.com/blog/how-japan-prepared-for-rare-earth-mineral-squeeze), but it was China’s slashing of its own rare exports by 40% in 2010, provoking a price spike and shortages, that drove a step-change in national strategy. Dependent for more than 90% of its rare-earth imports from China, Japan both invested heavily in exploration and refining for new sources, and rapidly built up its own stockpiles. [Its 2020 critical minerals strategy targets 60 days’ supply for most metals](https://www.questmetals.com/blog/how-japan-prepared-for-rare-earth-mineral-squeeze), while high-risk materials, such as those sourced from politically unstable countries, targets 180 days.

India, which has long maintained wheat and rice reserves, [approved plans in January 2025 to establish its own strategic reserve as part of a national critical minerals mission](https://india.mongabay.com/2025/02/india-approves-mission-to-bridge-critical-mineral-gap-in-energy-transition/). Australia announced its own version in January this year, focused initially on antimony, gallium and [rare-earth metals](https://www.industry.gov.au/news/strategic-reserve-secure-australias-critical-mineral-supply). [The European Union is urging member states to develop coordinated stockpiles](https://www.ft.com/content/48216c51-a784-48f0-8420-d4165f7c80a6), as “rising geopolitical tensions, the mounting impacts of climate change, environmental degradation, and hybrid and cyber-threats” imperil the bloc’s supplies.

When the US announces, as it did last week, that it will be investing $12bn (£9bn) in building a “strategic minerals reserve”, [with the first depot at Hawthorne army base, Nevada](https://www.fastmarkets.com/insights/meeting-the-critical-minerals-stockpile-challenge-fast-forward/), it is responding to the same logic. When it signs reams of critical mineral deals with other countries to create Vance’s “trading bloc”, it is scrabbling around for security in a world where championing free trade no longer hands it an automatic advantage.

Nor are the threats to supplies only from other states. The natural world is a growing source of instability. Summer 2024 was one dramatic version of this when Spruce Pine, a mining town of 2,000 in North Carolina that also happens to be the world’s primary source of ultra-high quality quartz for semiconductor production, [was battered by Storm Helene, closing its mines](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/30/nx-s1-5133462/hurricane-helene-quartz-microchips-solar-panels-spruce-pine). For a few days, the world’s silicon chip production hung in the balance. [PwC estimates that 70% of the world’s production of copper, cobalt and lithium will be at risk](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/news-room/press-releases/2024/pwc-2024-climate-risks-nine-key-commodities-report.html) of drought over the next few decades; [already, water-intensive copper mining and refining operations in Chile have been hit by the country’s mega-drought.](https://mine.nridigital.com/mine_jun25/chile-mines-water-use)

The rush to hoard precious metals is not the action of states secure in the knowledge that a vast, globalised market will always be ready to supply whatever is needed. This is what states do when they realise resource pressures are real – and other states have an incentive to carve them out. It’s a world of state versus state competition, on behalf of their national businesses. One tonne of copper stockpiled in Nevada is a tonne that can’t be used in Shenzhen, and vice versa. This is the new, zero-sum logic of the global shortage economy.

IMHO\~ The chatter out of Washington and Munich this week isn’t just geopolitical flavor — it’s **a strategic pivot in the global minerals economy** that directly lines up with what we’ve been calling for years: the U.S. recognizes that *material sovereignty matters*. With Secretary Rubio pushing a 55-nation critical minerals bloc and the launch of Project Vault — a $10+ billion strategic reserve financed by EXIM to create a domestic stockpile of critical metals — you can finally see Washington’s playbook shift from talk to execution. This matters for projects like Elk Creek and the seven minerals it hosts because it means the U.S. isn’t just talking supply chain security — it’s *backing it with capital and coordinated policy*.

On the rare earths front, the headlines about China’s dominant position and its strategic calm are exactly why the U.S. and its allies are breaking out new frameworks like FORGE and Project Vault. China still controls roughly 90%+ of deep processing for rare earths and heavy elements like dysprosium and terbium, but global industrial strategy is now explicitly focused on diversification and risk reduction. **For Elk Creek, which includes heavy rare earth potential alongside scandium, niobium, titanium, and REEs, this shift from import reliance toward domestic capability is a seismic long-term demand signal — not wishful thinking.**

**The stockpile strategy behind Project Vault is particularly enormous** because it goes beyond military stockpiling to include **commercial supply stabilization**, inviting major manufacturers — from automotive to aerospace and even tech players — into the ecosystem. That’s a literal *cash-flow support mechanism* for domestic projects and a hedge against geopolitical shocks. For Elk Creek and future downstream partners, **it means a potential built-in offtake or price support framework, which dramatically de-risks financial models and makes buyers more comfortable signing long-term contracts.**

This broader macro backdrop also confirms why we’ve seen cautious precision in corporate communications so far. **NioCorp’s DFS being focused on mining and processing right now doesn’t weaken the thesis — it aligns with what regulators and lenders look for: a** ***bankable core project first***\*\*, with the downstream integrations queued as strategic upside\*\*. The U.S. critical minerals policy narrative is now about *building integrated domestic supply chains*, not just individual projects. Elk Creek is positioned at the nexus of that shift — with seven critical elements that span defense, EVs, aerospace, and energy transition value chains.

**So as we wait for catalyst triggers like DFS, EXIM FID, portal & construction announcements, and downstream validation events. Remember that the global policy context has just expanded in our favor!** Washington is now treating critical minerals supply as a **national strategic priority**, and that creates real structural support for projects like Elk Creek and its upstream + downstream ecosystem. If the Saud Arabia analogy for scandium still feels bold, it’s only because we’re beginning to see the *policy and capital frameworks align with that vision* — and that’s the real story behind today’s headlines.

[NioCorp is Engaged & Rolling.. \\""The Elk Creek story is about to hit the catalyst stack like a freight train...All Aboard!!\\"" 🚂🔥](https://reddit.com/link/1r738w1/video/ij4bycr1f1kg1/player)

**And if you’ve been following the story…** this is exactly why the U.S. just went from “we should” to **“we are.”** Project Vault, FORGE, EXIM, stockpiles, pricing frameworks — it’s the 1950s titanium playbook being rebuilt in real time for **Sc + REEs + Nb + Ti.** That’s why Mark Smith hasn’t been shy about what’s happening behind the scenes, because he knows what Elk Creek represents in this new era. As he said flat-out: **“Yes — we’re talking to the Department of War as we speak.”** Pair that with his other line — Elk Creek is **“A National Strategic Asset”** — and the roadmap becomes crystal clear: **DFS → off-takes → EXIM/FID → buildout → mine-to-manufacturing by 2028–2029.** The market can ignore it at $5–$6… right up until the government and industry can’t. 🔥🚂

TL:DR - Sports addicted housemate not sleeping long enough, housemates unsupportive and landlord hands off

My new housemate seems to be a sports addict. He goes to badminton most nights and gets back around 11. He then gets up at 6am and makes breakfast. He was previously using a food blender in the kitchen at 6am the first month he lived here despite me immediately asking him in person to his face not to and telling him previous housemates had caused me to have to intervene with them when they used a coffee grinder at 6am without consulting anyone. He seemed to view this as a 'soft' 'see how it goes' request despite me sounding upset when I spoke to him in January. He then was confused when I asked for a sit down meeting a month later to explicitly ask again that the 6am blending should stop as it was waking me. My friends believe he is autistic and the communication styles need to be adapted as a result and need to be ultra clear. In my past experience if a housemate is making a seemingly polite request about sleep it is probably already an issue to them. I let slide that nobody else in the house cleans etc. but sleep is important to me. 

I would like to propose he doesn't do so much working out and doesn't wake up early if he has been out late the night before as I need eight hours sleep to function properly. He came into the kitchen on Friday and announced he would get up at 4am to go to Sheffield to play badminton. I then woke up with anxiety at 4am as I now can't rely on sleeping at the weekend. 

I questioned whether he'd carried on with the 6am blender routine when I found the blender on the drying rack downstairs this morning but he said he used it last night. He says ""you must stop making things up"" and me ""making things up...worries him a lot"". I feel he is questioning my sanity publicly in our group chat. I am just questioning his actions as I do not trust him based on past form and because my anxiety has been spiked by his ignoring the initial request on the 6am food blending. 

  
I asked the landlord to fix our doors - a front door which has no proper handle and an internal bathroom door which is swollen from water and very loud. The housemate accused me of being ""passive aggressive"" for making these mitigating enquiries about the door.

The other housemates don't really live in the house and are not willing to arrange a time for us all to meet and are being highly avoidant. The landlord says we need to sort it as adults but I am getting non-engagement from the other two housemates and no support. What do I do?

Before I get into it, yes, I know I should have been more direct with him instead of faking an emergency. I know that now. I knew it then, honestly. But there's a difference between knowing what you should do and actually doing it when you're sitting across from a man who smells like a cheese factory built on top of a mass grave. Fight or flight doesn't come with a ""have a mature conversation about boundaries"" option... At least mine doesn't.

To the people who think I was being shallow and that Theodore deserved a chance: respectfully, you were not there. You did not see the wall. You did not smell the smell. You did not witness a man eat tempura out of his own beard and lick a plate clean in a public restaurant. I promise you, this was not a case of me being superficial. This was a case of basic biological self-preservation.

Okay. Part 2. Buckle up.

So after I blocked Theodore on everything, I had about four days of peace. Four beautiful, quiet, tonsil-stone-free days where I almost convinced myself the whole thing had been a bad dream. I went to work. I hung out with Marissa. I went on a normal date with a normal dude who used utensils and did not wipe anything biological on any surfaces. Life was good. Life was normal.

Then Theodore showed up at my job.

I need to set the scene here. The brewery where I work, Millstone Brewing, is this chill little taproom in a converted warehouse. Exposed brick, string lights, the whole hipster aesthetic. We get a decent crowd on weekends but weeknights are pretty mellow. It was a Tuesday. I was behind the bar, wiping down glasses, talking to my coworker Jake about absolutely nothing important, when I looked up and felt my entire body go cold.

He was standing in the doorway. Fedora and all. Different shirt this time, a red button-up that was somehow in worse shape than the black one from our date. There was a visible stain on the front that could have been anything from mustard to something I refuse to speculate about. He was just standing there, scanning the room, and when his eyes found me, he SMILED. This big, wet, excited smile like a dog who just spotted its owner after a long day.

He waddled up to the bar and sat down on a stool, and the guy sitting next to where he chose to park immediately got up and moved. Just stood up, grabbed his beer, and relocated to the other end of the bar without a word. I understood. I envied him. I wished I could also simply leave.

""Danny!"" Theodore said, like we were old friends. Like we'd known each other for years and this was a happy reunion. ""I was in the neighborhood and I remembered you work here! What a coincidence!""

It was not a coincidence. Nothing about this was a coincidence. I lived fifteen minutes from the brewery and he lived, as I would later find out, on the complete opposite side of town. He did not just happen to be in the neighborhood. He came here on purpose, to my workplace, after I blocked him on every platform known to man.

But what was I supposed to do? He was a customer in my bar. I couldn't refuse to serve him. I couldn't call the cops because a guy sat down and ordered a drink. He hadn't technically done anything wrong, and that's the insidious thing about guys like this. They know exactly where the line is and they tap dance right up to it without ever technically crossing it, so if you complain, YOU look like the crazy one.

""Hey, Theo,"" I said, keeping my voice flat and professional. ""What can I get you?""

""What do you recommend? I usually drink Mountain Dew, but I'm trying to broaden my horizons."" He said this like it was charming. Like admitting your primary beverage is neon green sugar water was an endearing quirk and not a red flag the size of a football field.

I poured him our lightest beer because I didn't want him here long enough to get through anything heavy. He took a sip, made a face like a toddler trying lemon for the first time, and then proceeded to sit at my bar for THREE HOURS.

Three. Hours.

He nursed that single beer the entire time, talking at me whenever I came within earshot. And I do mean talking AT me, not TO me, because a conversation requires two participants and I was giving him absolutely nothing. One word answers. No eye contact. The energy of a man who would rather be literally anywhere else on planet Earth. And he either didn't notice or didn't care. I think it was the second one.

He told me about his anime collection. He told me about the three Discord servers he moderated and the ""drama"" on each one. He told me about his theory that society was collapsing because people didn't appreciate ""classical masculinity"" anymore, which was a wild thing to say while sitting in a brewery with a Mountain Dew palate and a stained shirt. He told me, at one point, that he was ""between living situations"" and was currently staying at his mom's old apartment that she'd left him when she moved to Florida. He said this like it was temporary. Like he had big plans right around the corner. I would later learn it was not temporary.

Jake, my coworker, pulled me aside at one point. ""Dude, is that guy bothering you? He keeps staring at you when you walk away.""

""It's a long story,"" I said.

""Is it the Grindr guy? The tonsil stone guy?""

I had made the mistake of telling Jake about the date. Jake had told approximately everyone.

""Yeah. It's him.""

""You want me to say something?""

""No. No, don't engage. That's what he wants. He wants a reaction. Just let him sit there and eventually he'll leave.""

He did leave. Eventually. But not before paying his tab (he tipped zero dollars, for the record) and saying, ""Same time next week?"" with a wink that made my skin crawl up my back and try to escape through my collar.

He came back the next Tuesday. And the Tuesday after that. And the one after that.

Every single Tuesday, Theodore parked himself at my bar and sat there for hours, nursing a single beer, talking at me about whatever crossed his mind while I tried to work around him. He never did anything technically threatening. Never raised his voice. Never made a scene. He was just... there. Constantly, oppressively, inescapably THERE. Like a mold you can't get rid of. Like a smell that's seeped into the walls.

My manager, Chris, noticed after the second week. ""Who's the guy in the fedora? He's freaking out the other customers.""

I explained the situation. Chris, to his credit, was sympathetic. But he also said, ""I mean, he's buying a beer. He's not being aggressive. I can't kick him out for being weird, Danny. We'd lose half our regulars.""

He wasn't wrong. But he also wasn't the one being slowly psychologically suffocated by a man who smelled like a gas station bathroom in July.

Marissa, predictably, was furious. ""This is stalking, Danny. This is textbook stalking behavior.""

""He's coming to a public bar and buying a drink. That's not stalking.""

""He's coming to YOUR bar, every week, on the same day, at the same time, after you blocked him on everything. That is stalking. The fact that he's doing it in a way that's hard to prove doesn't make it less stalking. It just makes him smarter than the average stalker, which should terrify you MORE.""

She had a point. She always had a point. Marissa was the kind of friend who was almost annoyingly correct about everything, and I was the kind of friend who nodded along and then did whatever I was going to do anyway.

The Tuesday visits went on for about a month. Each time, Theodore would sit a little closer to wherever I was working. Each time, his comments would get a little more personal. He started referencing things from our first date that I'd said, little details I didn't even remember sharing, proving he'd memorized our entire conversation. He once quoted something I'd said about liking hiking and asked if I wanted to go on a hike with him that weekend. I said no. He looked hurt. Then he looked angry. Then he looked hurt again. It was like watching a slot machine cycle through emotions.

But the real problem wasn't the Tuesdays. The real problem was what I didn't know was happening between the Tuesdays.

Because while Theodore was playing the long game at my bar, he was also playing a completely different game online. One I didn't find out about until it was almost too late.



About six weeks after the original date from hell, I decided to give Grindr another shot. I know, I KNOW. But I'd been single for months, the Theodore situation seemed to have stabilized into a manageable annoyance (he shows up, I ignore him, he leaves, repeat), and I was lonely. Lonliness, as I mentioned in Part 1, makes you dumb. I was about to prove that theory for the second time.

I matched with a guy named Marcus. His profile was... actually good? Like, normal. Recent photos, clear face, regular bio. ""28, graphic designer, into hiking and bad horror movies."" That's it. No thesaurus language. No ""intellectual conversation."" No ""GentleSir"" anything. Just a regular dude with a nice smile and good taste in movies.

We talked for about a week. The conversation was easy. Natural. He used normal words and made me laugh and didn't once bring up the age of consent or any other topic that would get you put on a watchlist. He asked about my job, my hobbies, my taste in music. He shared his own stuff. It felt like talking to an actual human being, which shouldn't be a notable achievement but after Theodore, the bar was underground.

After a week, Marcus suggested meeting up. And here's where he was different from Theodore in a way that should have been a red flag but my dumb lonely brain read as a green one. He suggested his place.

""I'm a great cook,"" he said. ""I'll make dinner. Way more relaxed than a restaurant.""

Now, look. I can already hear you screaming at your screen. ""DANNY NO. DANNY YOU ABSOLUTE WALNUT."" And you're right. Going to a stranger's apartment for a first date is not smart. It's not safe. It is, in fact, the kind of thing that after-school specials warn you about. But here's the thing: in the gay dating world, going to someone's place isn't unusual. It's actually pretty common. The whole culture is a little more... accelerated than straight dating. Not always, but often enough that an apartment hangout for a first meeting didn't trip my alarm bells.

What tripped my alarm bells, or what SHOULD have, was that Marcus didn't want to video chat first. I suggested it twice and both times he deflected. ""My camera's broken,"" then ""I'm not really a video person."" I let it go. I shouldn't have let it go.

He gave me his address on a Saturday evening. It was across town, in this older apartment complex that looked like it hadn't been updated since the early 90s. The parking lot had that particular neglected look where the lines were barely visible and there were weeds growing through the cracks. I parked, texted Marissa the address (she'd insisted), and walked up to the second floor.

The hallway outside apartment 2B smelled weird. Not terrible, not yet, but weird. Like old takeout and something vaguely chemical, like nail polish remover mixed with sweat. I figured it was just an old building thing. Old buildings smell weird. That's just life.

I knocked. And for about three seconds, everything was fine. I heard footsteps approaching the door. I straightened my shirt. I ran a hand through my hair. I was nervous in the normal, butterflies-in-your-stomach way that you're supposed to be nervous before a first date.

Then the door opened.

And the world ended.

It was Theodore.

Theodore. In his doorway. In a different shirt than usual, a blue one, like he'd DRESSED UP for this. He was beaming. This enormous, triumphant, ear-to-ear grin like a villain who'd just revealed his master plan. Like a chess player saying checkmate. Like he'd won something.

""Danny!"" he said. ""I knew you'd come.""

I stood there. My brain was doing that thing where it tries to process information but the information is so fundamentally wrong that it just... buffers. Like a loading screen. I could feel my mouth hanging open. I could hear my own heartbeat in my ears. I could smell him, that smell, that SMELL, rolling out of the apartment behind him like fog.

""You..."" I started.

""I knew if I just had the chance to show you the real me, you'd come around. You just needed to get to know me in a comfortable setting."" He stepped aside and gestured into the apartment like a real estate agent showing a listing, except no real estate agent in history has ever tried to sell what I was looking at.

I should have turned around. I should have walked away immediately, gotten in my car, and driven to the police station. That's what a smart person would have done. That's what Marissa would have told me to do. That's what every single one of you would tell me to do.

But I didn't.

Because standing there, looking past Theodore into that apartment, I was hit with a wave of something beyond disgust. It was morbid fascination. The same instinct that makes people slow down at car wrecks. The same part of your brain that makes you click on a link that says ""you don't want to see this"" BECAUSE it says you don't want to see it. I looked into that apartment and some broken, masochistic part of my brain said: you need to see this. You need to understand the full scope of what you're dealing with.

So I stepped inside. And Christ Almighty... I saw.



How do I describe Theodore's apartment? I've been sitting here for twenty minutes trying to figure out how to put it into words and I keep deleting what I write because nothing captures it. Language wasn't designed for this. Human communication has limits and Theodore's apartment existed beyond those limits, in a realm of filth that no combination of letters was ever intended to convey.

But I'm gonna try.

The living room was the first thing you saw when you walked in, and it set the tone for everything that followed. The carpet, which I think was originally beige, was a dark brownish-gray. Not from a design choice. From years of accumulated grime, spilled drinks, dropped food, and what I can only describe as general biological seepage. It was STICKY. My shoes made a soft peeling sound with every step, like walking on tape. There were paths worn into the carpet where Theodore clearly walked most often, darker and more matted than the rest, like animal trails through underbrush.

The couch was a disaster. It was one of those big overstuffed sectionals that might have been nice at some point, maybe in 2008, maybe before Theodore happened to it. Now it was sunken in the middle from years of bearing his weight, the cushions compressed into permanent body-shaped craters. There were stains everywhere. Not like ""oh I spilled some coffee"" stains. Deep, mysterious, multi-layered stains that told stories I didn't want to read. The armrests were darkened and shiny from skin oil. There was a permanent grease outline on the back cushion where his head rested, a perfect silhouette like a disgusting Shroud of Turin.

Around the couch was a perimeter of trash. Not scattered trash. STRUCTURED trash. It had built up over so long that it had formed geological layers, like sedimentary rock. The bottom layers were compressed and flattened: old pizza boxes, crushed chip bags, flattened soda cans. The middle layers were more recent: takeout containers with dried sauce still visible, empty energy drink cans, wadded up paper towels that I didn't want to think about too hard. And the top layer was fresh: a half-eaten bag of Doritos, three open Mountain Dew bottles in various states of fullness, and a plate with what appeared to be the remains of chicken tenders that had been there long enough to develop a fuzzy green coat.

The smell in the living room was bad. It was a thick, sweet, rotting smell layered with body odor and stale grease. But it wasn't THE smell. The living room was just the opening act. The headliner was waiting down the hall.

""Let me give you the tour!"" Theodore said, with the enthusiasm of a man who genuinely believed his apartment was impressive. And I think that's what got me. He wasn't embarrassed. He wasn't apologetic. He was PROUD. He was showing me his home the way you'd show someone a new renovation. He pointed out his anime figure collection (displayed on shelves that were somehow the cleanest surfaces in the apartment, like he'd allocated all his care and attention to these plastic figurines while the rest of his life rotted around them). He showed me his gaming setup, three monitors surrounded by a fortress of empty cans and snack wrappers, with a gaming chair that had a visible body-shaped sweat stain on the seat. He showed me his ""collection wall"" which was covered in anime posters, some of which featured characters that looked uncomfortably young in uncomfortably little clothing, and I felt my skin try to leave my body.

Through all of this, Theodore was talking. He was always talking. A constant stream of words about his interests, his plans, his ""projects"" (none of which seemed to involve cleaning). He was narrating the tour like a museum docent, pointing out items of alleged significance while I walked through his apartment in a state of dissociative horror.

And then we got to the hallway.

The hallway was where things shifted from ""disgusting"" to ""genuinely disturbing."" The walls, which were painted that standard apartment off-white, had marks on them. Not just scuff marks. Streaks. Yellowish-brownish streaks at roughly hand height, like someone had been wiping their hands on the walls as they walked by. Some of them were fresh. Some of them were old and darkened. There were dozens of them. Maybe hundreds.

I stopped and stared at one of the fresher streaks and a horrible realization clicked into place. I knew what these were. I'd seen Theodore make one of these before. At a restaurant. On the wall next to our booth. At Koi Pond.

""Theodore,"" I said, and my voice was very quiet, ""are these tonsil stones on the walls?""

He glanced at the streaks like he was seeing them for the first time. ""Oh. Yeah. I mean, I get them a lot, you know? I have really deep tonsil crypts. The doctor says it's genetic."" He shrugged. Shrugged! Like we were discussing a minor inconvenience. Like the walls of his apartment weren't plastered with calcified throat pellets.

""You just... wipe them on the wall,"" I said. It wasn't a question. It was a statement of fact that my brain was trying to accept.

""Where else am I gonna put them?"" he asked, genuinely confused.

WHERE ELSE AM I GONNA PUT THEM. A trash can, Theodore. A tissue. The toilet. Your pocket, even, you unbelievable gremlin of a man. Literally ANYWHERE other than the walls of your home. I wanted to scream this. I didn't scream this. I was too deep in shock to scream anything.

He kept walking. I kept following. I don't know why I kept following. Trauma response, maybe. Morbid curiosity run amok. The sunk cost fallacy of horror.

And then we reached the bathroom.



I need you to understand something before I describe this bathroom. I need you to understand that I have seen things. I worked as a janitor in college. I've cleaned up after frat parties. I've dealt with things that would make most people gag. I have a strong stomach and a high tolerance for gross.

This broke me.

Theodore opened the bathroom door with a casual ""oh and here's the bathroom"" and a wall of smell hit me so hard I actually staggered backward. It was like walking into a physical object. The smell was WET. It had TEXTURE. It was this unholy combination of raw sewage, mildew, ammonia, and something sweet and rotting that I couldn't identify and didn't want to. My eyes watered. Not from emotion. From the actual chemical composition of the air.

The bathroom floor was covered in a thin layer of... moisture. Not water. Not exactly. It was this grayish, slightly viscous film that coated everything from the base of the toilet to the edges of the tub. I could see footprints in it. Theodore's footprints, bare, preserved in the film like fossils. The bath mat, which was originally white (I think), was now a deep yellowish-brown and looked like it hadn't been washed since it was purchased. It squelched when I accidentally stepped on it. SQUELCHED. I felt moisture seep through my shoe and I made a sound that wasn't quite a word.

The shower was growing things. The tile grout, which was probably once white, was now black with mold. But the mold had graduated beyond just the grout. It had spread onto the tiles themselves, creeping upward in fractal patterns like some kind of alien vegetation. The shower curtain was translucent enough that I could see the inside was coated in a pinkish-orange slime, that bacterial biofilm that grows in perpetually damp spaces. There was a washcloth hanging over the faucet that looked like it had been there since the Clinton administration and had achieved a level of stiffness that suggested it could stand up on its own.

The sink was caked with toothpaste residue so thick it had formed stalactites on the rim of the basin. There were beard trimmings everywhere, not just on the counter but on the walls, on the mirror, stuck in dried globs of soap or toothpaste or something I couldn't identify. The mirror itself was so spotted and smeared that you could barely see your reflection, which was honestly a mercy because I didn't want to see what my face was doing.

But the toilet. Oh God, the toilet.

I need to take a break here. I need to steel myself.

Okay.

The toilet.

The bowl itself was stained in a way that suggested it hadn't been cleaned in years. Not months. YEARS. There was a ring of buildup around the waterline that was so thick it had changed the interior geography of the bowl. The seat was up (of course it was) and the underside of the seat had a coating of dried something that I'm not going to describe in detail because I want you to be able to eat again someday.

But the thing that caught my eye, the thing that would haunt me forever, was the tank.

The top of the toilet tank was slightly ajar. Not a lot. Just enough to notice. And there was a smell coming from it that was distinctly different from the general bathroom apocalypse. This smell was sharper. More concentrated. More... fecal.

""Hey, uh, Theo?"" I said, and I'm not proud of the fact that I was still here, still in this bathroom, still on this tour of human failure. ""What's up with your toilet tank?""

His face did something weird. For the first time since I'd arrived, he looked almost sheepish. Almost embarrassed. In a sea of wall tonsil stones and carpet sediment and shower mold, THIS was the thing that gave him pause.

""Oh. Yeah. So the handle broke like a year ago, and I can't flush the regular way. So I have to, um. I have to manually lift the flapper in the tank to flush.""

""Okay...""

""And sometimes, you know, if I'm in a rush, or if the water's not filling right, it's just easier to... go in the tank.""

He said this quickly, like ripping off a bandaid. Like if he got the words out fast enough they'd hurt less.

""Go in the tank,"" I repeated.

""Yeah.""

""You poop in the tank of your toilet.""

""Not EVERY time. Just sometimes. When the bowl is being difficult.""

WHEN THE BOWL IS BEING DIFFICULT. As if the toilet bowl was a stubborn employee who sometimes didn't cooperate. As if there was a valid scenario in which a grown adult man looks at a malfunctioning toilet and says ""you know what? I'll just shit in the back part."" As if this was a SOLUTION to a PROBLEM and not a whole new category of problem that I don't think has a name.

I lifted the tank lid. I don't know why. I'd already been told what was in there. I already knew. But some part of me needed to see it with my own eyes, the same way some part of me had walked into this apartment in the first place. The same broken, self-destructive curiosity that had been driving my decisions all evening.

I lifted the lid and I looked inside.

I'm not going to describe what I saw in detail. I can't. I physically cannot type the words. What I will tell you is that the tank was not functioning as a toilet tank anymore. It was functioning as something else entirely. The water was not water-colored. The mechanical parts were coated in a substance that had fundamentally altered their function. The smell that came out when I lifted that lid hit me like a punch to the face and I GAGGED. Actually gagged. The first real, physical, involuntary gag of the evening, which is remarkable considering everything else I'd already seen.

I put the lid down. I stared at Theodore. He stared at me. There was a moment of silence that felt like it lasted a thousand years.

""It's really not as bad as it looks,"" he said.

It was exactly as bad as it looked. It was possibly worse than it looked.

""I need to go,"" I said.

""What? But I was going to make dinner! I got stuff for pasta!""

The idea of Theodore making pasta. Theodore, with his hands, the hands that produced tonsil stones and wiped them on walls, the hands that opened a toilet tank he'd been defecating into for a year, those hands touching pasta, COOKING pasta, serving it to me on a plate that lived in this apartment. My stomach did a full revolution.

""I have to go,"" I said again, already moving toward the door.

""Danny, wait. Don't leave. Not again."" His voice changed. That desperate, needy quality from the Grindr messages was back. ""You just got here. You haven't even seen my bedroom.""

I DID NOT WANT TO SEE HIS BEDROOM. I did not want to see any more of anything. I wanted to leave this apartment, get in my car, drive to the nearest hazmat facility, and have them hose me down with whatever they use to clean up nuclear waste.

""Theodore,"" I said, and I stopped at the door, and something in me finally snapped. Not in an angry way. In a tired way. In a ""I am done being polite about this"" way. ""You catfished me. You made a fake profile. You pretended to be someone else to get me here. That's not okay. That's not romantic. That's not you showing me the 'real you.' That's manipulation. That's lying.""

His face went through the cycle. The Theodore cycle. Hurt, anger, self-pity, rationalization. I was getting good at recognizing the stages.

""I had to!"" he said. ""You blocked me! You wouldn't give me a chance! I knew if I could just get you here, if you could see how I live, you'd understand me!""

""Theodore, I can SEE how you live. I can see it and I can SMELL it. You have tonsil stones on your walls. You have mold in your shower. You poop in the tank of your toilet. This is not a 'get to know me' situation. This is a 'call the health department' situation.""

""You're just like everyone else,"" he whispered. And his eyes were wet. And for one terrible second I felt bad. For one tiny, stupid, empathy-poisoned second I felt guilty for saying these things to a person who was clearly struggling.

Then I remembered he'd created an entire fake identity to lure me to his apartment, and the guilt evaporated like water on a hot pan.

""Don't come to the brewery anymore,"" I said. ""Don't message me. Don't make fake profiles. Don't contact me in any way. We are done. There is no 'us.' There was never an 'us.' I am asking you, clearly and directly, to leave me alone.""

I left. I walked out the door, down the stairs, across the parking lot. I got in my car. I locked the doors. And I sat there, shaking, for a very long time.

Then I called Marissa.

""Marissa,"" I said, ""I need to tell you something and I need you to not say 'I told you so' until I'm finished.""

""Oh God. What happened?""

So I told her. Everything. The fake profile, the apartment, the trash strata, the anime figures, the tonsil stone hallway, the shower ecosystem, and the toilet tank. I told her all of it, and when I got to the part about the tank, there was a silence so profound I thought the call had dropped again.

""He shits in the tank,"" she said, very slowly, like she was trying to process each word individually.

""He shits in the tank.""

""Of his toilet.""

""Of his toilet.""

""The TANK part.""

""The tank part.""

Another silence. Then: ""Isn't that called an upper decker?""

And that, my friends, is how Theodore earned his name. From that moment on, in all conversations between me and Marissa, and eventually among our entire friend group, he was no longer Theodore. He was no longer Theo. He was no longer GentleSir\_Seeks\_More.

He was Upperdeckerbeard.

And he was about to get so, so much worse.



After the apartment incident, I did what I should have done weeks earlier. I went to the police.

I sat in a fluorescent-lit office at the station and explained everything to an officer named Rodriguez who was clearly trying very hard to maintain a professional expression and failing. I showed him the Grindr messages. I showed him the 47-message barrage from after our first date. I told him about the Tuesday visits to my workplace. I told him about the catfish profile and being lured to the apartment.

Rodriguez took notes. He asked good questions. And then he said the thing that every stalking victim hears and every stalking victim hates: ""Has he explicitly threatened you?""

""He showed up at my workplace repeatedly after I blocked him on everything.""

""That's concerning, but it's a public establishment.""

""He made a fake profile to trick me into coming to his apartment.""

""That's dishonest, but it's not technically illegal.""

""He sent me 47 messages in one night.""

""On a dating app, which is designed for messaging.""

I could feel the frustration building in my chest like a pressure cooker. Everything Theodore had done was wrong. Everything he'd done was scary and invasive and boundary-violating. But none of it, individually, was illegal enough. None of it was dramatic enough. It was all in that gray zone where stalkers live, where every individual action can be explained away but the pattern adds up to something terrifying.

Rodriguez, to his credit, could see my frustration. ""Look,"" he said, ""I believe you. I can see this guy is a problem. But for a restraining order, I need documented evidence of a pattern of harassment that a judge would consider threatening. Keep saving everything. Screenshot every message. Document every time he shows up. If he escalates, and unfortunately guys like this usually do, come back and we'll have a stronger case.""

""So I just wait for him to escalate?""

""I know that's not what you want to hear.""

It was not what I wanted to hear.

I left the station feeling defeated and exposed. I'd done the ""right thing."" I'd gone to the authorities. And the authorities had basically said ""yeah this sucks but our hands are tied until he does something worse."" Which meant I was living in this limbo where I knew something bad was coming but couldn't do anything about it except wait and document and hope that when it finally happened, it happened in a way that was provable enough to matter.

Marissa was livid. ""That's insane. He CATFISHED you to get you to his apartment. How is that not enough?""

""I went voluntarily. Nobody forced me through the door.""

""He tricked you!""

""Yeah but I still walked in.""

""Under false pretenses!""

I know. I know. But the law is the law, and the law, as it turns out, is not great at handling situations where someone is being systematically terrorized by a man who poops in his own toilet tank. There's no checkbox for that on the police report.

I went home that night and did the only thing I could do. I documented everything. I made a folder on my computer called ""UDB"" (Upperdeckerbeard, obviously) and started filling it with screenshots, dates, times, descriptions. Every Tuesday visit. Every message. Every piece of evidence that this man was orbiting my life like a smelly, fedora-wearing satellite.

I changed my Grindr settings. Made my profile unsearchable. Removed any identifying information. I told my manager Chris to let me know immediately if Theodore showed up on a day other than Tuesday. I told Jake, I told my other coworker Sam, I told everyone at the brewery what he looked like and what to do if he came in and I wasn't there.

I was building a fortress. A real one this time, not just digital. I was preparing for war.

But Upperdeckerbeard, as it turned out, wasn't done being creative. The catfish had worked, in his mind. He'd gotten me to his apartment. He'd shown me his ""authentic self."" And in Theodore's twisted version of reality, my horrified rejection wasn't a rejection at all. It was just another test. Another obstacle in the quest.

The messages found a way through. They always find a way through. New profiles. New platforms. Even, at one point, a handwritten letter slipped under the door of the brewery after hours. I still have it. It's three pages long, front and back, written in surprisingly neat handwriting that somehow made it worse. It called me his ""soulmate."" It said he'd been ""patient"" and that he knew I'd ""come back"" when I was ""ready to accept real love.""

I added it to the folder.

Part 3 is where it all comes to a head. And I'll be honest with you, writing this has been hard. Part 2 has been sitting in my drafts for a week because every time I think about that apartment, about that bathroom, about lifting that tank lid, I feel the nausea come back like muscle memory. But you all deserve to know how this ends. And it does end. I promise you that.

It ends.



**TL;DR: Upperdeckerbeard started showing up at my job every Tuesday. Then he catfished me with a fake Grindr profile to lure me to his apartment, which was a biohazard site featuring tonsil stone walls, shower mold that could qualify as a nature preserve, and a toilet tank he'd been using as a backup toilet for a year. I confronted him, told him to leave me alone, went to the police, and started building a documentation folder. He responded with new fake profiles and a handwritten love letter. Part 3 is the finale.**

**Part 3 coming soon. The ending is satisfying. I promise.**",1,1771326456.0,ReddXReads,0,1.0,False

While an undergraduate degree rewards technical knowledge, an MBA rewards networking, time management, and the ability to make decisions with imperfect data.

To truly ace your MBA, you need to shift from a student mindset to a ""C-suite"" mindset.

  


**1. The 80/20 Rule of Academics**

In an MBA, you will face ""The Firehose""—a volume of reading that is physically impossible to complete.

* **Prioritize the Case Study:** Don't read every page of the textbook. Focus 80% of your energy on the **Case Method**. Understand the ""pivot point"" where the business succeeded or failed.
* **The ""Good Enough"" Grade:** Unless you are aiming for a PhD or a highly technical role in Quantitative Finance, a 4.0 GPA is often less valuable than the relationships you build.

**2. Network as a Job Description**

Your classmates are your future board members, co-founders, and investors.

* **Be the Connector:** Don't just attend events; organize them. The person who brings people together is perceived as a natural leader.
* **Vertical Networking:** Reach out to alumni while you are still a student. The ""student card"" is a superpower—people who would never answer a cold call from a salesperson will almost always take a 15-minute coffee chat with an MBA candidate.

**3. Build a ""T-Shaped"" Skill Set**

The best MBA candidates are broad generalists with one deep specialty.

* **The Breadth:** Understand enough Accounting, Marketing, and Operations to hold a conversation in a boardroom.
* **The Depth:** Become the ""go-to"" person for one specific thing (e.g., Data Analytics, ESG Strategy, or Supply Chain).

  


**The MBA Success Matrix**

**4. Optimize for the ""Pivot""**

**An MBA is the best time to fail**. Use the safe environment of the classroom to test business ideas or leadership styles that would be too risky in a real job. If you leave your MBA exactly the same person you were when you entered, you’ve wasted your tuition.

Like many of you, I’ve dealt with the nightmare of finding a decent apartment/condos in Addis Ababa. Between unreliable listings, ""ghost"" properties, and the absolute chaos of finding a truck/man-with-a-van to move your appliances on short notice, the process is broken.  
I decided to stop complaining and built [**Hidmo.app**](https://hidmo.app).  
  
**What is Hidmo?** It’s not just another listing site. We are a ""Home Transition"" platform.

1. **Verified Rentals:** We’re working on getting boots-on-the-ground verification for listings to kill the ""fake photo"" culture.
2. **Integrated Movers:** You can book a verified truck/pickup directly through the app the moment you find your home. No more haggling on the street for a truck while your fridge sits on the curb.

**Where we are now:** The app is live and functional. I’ve started manually onboarding the first batch of high-quality properties and moving crews.

**Why I’m posting here:** I’ve taken it as far as I can as a solo founder. To turn this into a standard for how people move in Ethiopia, I’m looking for:

* **Strategic Partners:** People with deep roots in the Addis real estate market or logistics/transportation sectors.
* **Early-Stage Investors/Angels:** Those who see the potential in modernizing Ethiopia’s ""last-mile"" home services.
* **Feedback:** If you're a renter or a landlord, what is the #1 feature that would make you use Hidmo over a Telegram group or a random Delala?

Till now, I have only tried coffees from Blue Tokai and tbh I think I'm starting to appreciate a good cup of joe. Since, I'm just getting started I'm using the Channi method, as I want to see whether speciality coffee is my cup of ~~tea~~ coffee. 

My brewing method is as follows:-

* Water at 90-92 degree Celsius
* \~2 tbsp of coffee for 120-150mL of water
* 3:1 coffee to milk ratio so \~40-50mL of milk
* I brew it for 3:30 mins then press the crust and leave it for another 4-5 mins before filtering it using Channi

Until now I have tried:

Attikan Estate - bought from Swiggy instamart so I got September 2025 roasted beans (I was a noob); Still it was good

13th B'day blend (bought from the website so got recently roasted beans; Initially it was surprisingly good but I was struggling to taste different notes w/ milk after a couple of days. 

I want to try medium to dark roasts with milk but I'm open to good light roasts as well. I read that due to VC funding Blue Tokai's price has seen a hike and maybe quality has dropped. I'm running out of the B'day blend so I was thinking of buying a customised sampler pack from Blue Tokai with Dhak Blend, BasanKhan Estate and Amruthavarshini Estate. 

Although considering the recent reviews I'm reluctant, shall I buy this particular sampler from BT or Would you recommend any other coffees from BT? 

OR 

Would you suggest any other roasters apart from BT who deliver online?

He (20M) has been genuinely nothing but chronically miserable since he met her (19F), last week was the last straw. It was the 3rd time he asked for me for advice on his doomed relationship. The first time was her ditching him to go hang out with her co workers on a planned date night, alright shitty thing to do, otherwise whatever, the second time was her accusing him of trying to cheat on him, as that's what she would do (Make up a story of going for coffee with a friend) to cheat, (Wtf) she was proven wrong via a snapchat.

This most recent time? He caught her with one of her co workers PLAY FIGHTING IN THE STREET WITH HER PHONE. When he confronted her, she just smiled and said, babe he's a friend. Bare in mind, she finished work and was SUPPOSED to meet him halfway onto the path to his house, she went a different route with thjs co worker, knowingly to a bus stop, that goes to hers. She reluctantly gets on a bus with him to go to his place. This is all by what I have been told.

He asks me for advice on this then calls me bias and jealous when I say she treats you like dirt, and that he deserves better, he has turned into a abhorrent miserable thing. Going as far as to tell me to ""pack it in"" when I liked a fucking INSTAGRAM NOTE of hers. Honestly, I'm thinking of cutting my hair a bit and leaving it round his so she can find it, genuinely cannot stand him or her anymore.

1r72zj3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sakartvelo/comments/1r72zj3/impressions_of_georgia_for_americans_first_timer/,"Impressions of Georgia for Americans, First Timer","I just finished a month trip to Tiblisi and Batumi. These are the impressions if an old retired American who is familiar with Geogian history and culture {from books}. I have mostly been in Asia for the past years, with some significant time in Baku.

1. The Tblisi airport was adequate. I did not have checked baggage so I zipped right through. I used an ATM at the airport and called a Bolt, I wasnt hassled by touts.
2. Slums are slums everywhere. My driver in from the airport zipped down some back streets it  was a gnarly as Khlong Toey in Bangkok or the back roads of Cambodia. This was my general view in all the places I methave been, there are some folks who live like crap everywhere. You guys can discuss the poverty rate etc, but unquestionably its 3rd World MEANING IN APPEARANCE AND PROBABLY INSIDE THE BUILDINGS.
3. Scenery. World class from what I could see. Im sad Im too old to take advantage. Batumi reminded me of Anchorage Alaska with a sea right there. The mountains are incredible. I have seen vids from agile friends and family, and with the cost of everything compared, I can see why Georgia is a rapidly growing tourist destination.
4. Did I mention that Tblisi is gorgeous scenery wise?
5. Cool buildings in Tblisi, the old city is so fine and historical keeping the slum factor in mind, the Cable car is fantastic. The food is incredible and cheap and I ran all sorts of foods from varying places into my gut. Street food was soooooo handy, $2 katchapuri heaven. The old City in Baku is a lot less slummy though
6. Good coffee and tea culture, but if you are asianized Yank, you will miss Coffee with Condensed milk or even milk. Its always cappucinos everywhere in little cups. Now $1 7-11 cups, 20oz with creamers. On the other hand, the Hot Chocolates are fanstic.
7. Staying at home for folks doesnt work, the cafes are packed in Tblisi and so are the promenades when the weather in nice in Batumi.
8. I didnt really party in Tibilis, but in Batumi I enjoyed the young crowd in the bars. I made a few friends to the extent I got invites to family homes and whats app numbers from dudes. The dreaded herb was non existent for me in Tbilisi but found in Baku, but bunky, no 50% like the infused flower I am indulging here in NY
9. The transport from Tbilisi to Batumi is excellent, I went by bus. Great scenery. The part of Kutaisi where the Bus station is at is a slum. The bus station in Tiblisi is a disgrace.
10. The casinos all over are cheesy and not really worth visiting. I won some at the Iveria in Tibisi but if you are a westerner, there are far better gambling options. Batumi is the pits on that regard, the clientele is cross border and local area tourists.
11. The Heart of Batumi has great Georgian food. If you think you are going to get a real Kosher Pastrami like you get in NYC, forget it it, its all stupidly priced yucky Israeli food. Great Ukrainian food at At The Sisters in the Old City of Batumi
12. The graffitti is disgusting and a disgrace to your country. In America, we call it ghetto and it is worse than Third World Cambodia. Its worsest in Tbilisi. A young man told me it was young people protesting. etc. I dont care why, one doesnt poop in the diapers to piss off daddy.
13. Georgians hate Russians. Good for you guys. Me too, they are terrible tourists. You guys need to get rid of your old Russian coldness like they have in Baku, Azeris are friendlier
14. The construction standards suck, not your fault though. Soviet buildings suck, not your fault though.
15. If I was to live there, it would be Old City Batumi in an old pre revolution building that has been rehabbed. I need to go back and check the tourist trade first. The weather sucks in Batumi in February, although better than in Baku. I dont mind actual snow like in Batumi
16. The Batumi Airport is pretty efficient and the security easy (unless you are on a Tel Aviv flight}. If going to NYC, take a layover in Istanbul, nice efficient Airport but a second security check if you are a non US passport holder.
17. Stay away from the Protests. Dont pay attention to the American flags waved. Their problems are their problems. If they want to make real money they will figure it out. Most Georgian folks like Americans. Dont try to say anything other than thank you and hello, its too complicated, plus speaking English marks you as an American. I tip even when they add the service charge. Remember the slums. Stalin socks are for tourists.
18. Im going back in a few months. The no visa thing is cool

To help out those who dont speak English as a first language. I do not consider Georgia to be a : Third World or a Second World Country, or a sh\*thole. I am referring to the appearance of the slums or unrestored buildngs.",0,1771325860.0,Sakartvelo,13,0.37,False

Buckle up, because this is a long one, and it gets so much worse than you think it will. I promise you that. Whatever you're imagining right now? Multiply it by a thousand and add a smell.

Some background on me: I'm Danny. I'm 27, I'm gay, I live alone in a mid-sized city in the midwest, and I work at a pretty chill craft brewery. I'm not like, a model or anything, but I take care of myself. I shower daily (this is going to be a relevant detail later, trust me), I go to the gym a few times a week, and I have a healthy relationship with basic hygene. I hope ReddX hasn't dug into me yet because I say all of this not to brag, but to establish a baseline of normalcy so you understand the absolute CHASM between my world and the world I was about to step into.

Like a lot of gay dudes, I'm on Grindr. If you don't know what Grindr is, first of all, bless your innocent heart. It's basically a hookup/dating app for men who like men. It's about as classy as you'd expect. You see a lot of things on there. Unsolicited pics, guys who open with ""looking?"" at 3am, blank profiles that message you like they're the CIA. Torso pics that are clearly from 2012. Bios that just say ""no fats no fems"" like that's a personality. Married dudes whose profile picture is their dog because they think that provides plausible deniability. It's a jungle out there, is what I'm saying. But it's the jungle we've got, and sometimes you meet a normal person in the jungle and go on a nice date and everything's fine. And sometimes the jungle introduces you to a man who will haunt your waking nightmares for months. Guess which one happened to me.

I thought I'd seen the worst Grindr had to offer. I was a fool. A sweet summer fool.

So about three months ago I matched with this dude. His profile name was ""GentleSir\_Seeks\_More"" and honestly? That should have been red flag number one. Red flag number one through ten, actually. But his profile pics were... okay? Like, clearly filtered to hell and back. We're talking beauty mode cranked to maximum, the kind of smoothing that makes your skin look like a fresh stick of butter. But the general shape of a person was there. He said he was 30, into anime, gaming, and ""intellectual conversation.""

I know. I KNOW. But listen, I'd just gotten out of a thing with a dude who ghosted me after three months, and my self esteem was in the toilet. (Not THAT toilet. We'll get there.) I was lonely, okay? Lonliness makes you dumb. It makes you swipe right on profiles that your sober, well-rested brain would run screaming from. So I swiped. And he messaged me almost immediatly.

**GentleSir\_Seeks\_More:** Greetings! I must say, your profile is quite refreshing. Most guys on here are so vapid, but you seem like someone capable of actual discourse :3

Now look. I get it. Reading that now, every alarm bell in the world should have been going off. But at the time, I was like, ""oh that's kinda sweet, he's a little formal but maybe he's just nervous."" DANNY YOU ABSOLUTE WALNUT.

We chatted for about a week. And I'm gonna be real with you, the conversation was... not terrible? Like, it was weird. He had this way of talking that was like a thesaurus had a baby with a manga subtitle. Everything was overly formal and peppered with words nobody uses in actual human conversation. He'd say things like ""I find your perspective quite scintillating"" when I'd say something basic like ""yeah pizza is good."" But I chalked it up to social awkwardness.

He told me his name was Theodore. ""But you can call me Theo,"" he said, like he was granting me some great honor. He said he worked from home doing ""freelance consulting"" which, as I would later learn, meant he moderated three Discord servers and occasionally sold anime figures on eBay.

After about a week of chatting, he suggested we meet up. He picked the restaurant, this little Japanese place downtown called Koi Pond. Not a bad choice, actually. I figured hey, maybe this won't be so bad. Maybe the filters were just him being insecure and he's actually a decent dude underneath the weird vocabulary.

I want you to remember that optimism. Hold it in your heart. Because it's about to be murdered.



I got to Koi Pond about ten minutes early because I'm the kind of anxious person who'd rather sit alone awkwardly than risk being late. I grabbed a booth, ordered some water, and waited. Five minutes passed. Ten. Fifteen. I was about to text him when the door opened and I watched my evening, and a small part of my soul, begin to die.

Let me paint this picture for you. And I want you to really sit with it, because I need you to understand what walked through that door. Close your eyes. Actually don't close your eyes, you're reading this. But mentally prepare yourself. Get a glass of water. Maybe open a window. You're gonna need fresh air.

The door opened and this... presence entered the restaurant. I say presence because the smell arrived about three seconds before the man did, like an advance scout warning the rest of the senses what was coming. The hostess, this sweet little college-age girl, physically took a step backward. Not subtly either. She full-on retreated like the man had pulled a weapon. I watched her face cycle through confusion, recognition, horror, and then that dead-eyed customer service mask that food workers develop as a survival mechanism.

Theodore was... not what his pictures suggested. That's the diplomatic version. The honest version is that his profile pics must have been from 2015, taken from the one angle that God intended, with enough filters to qualify as fraud. The man who walked into Koi Pond was easily 350 pounds. He was wearing a black button-up shirt that was working OVERTIME. I mean those buttons were hanging on for dear life, doing the structural work of a suspension bridge. The shirt was tucked into cargo shorts, and not in a fun ironic way. In a ""this is genuinely how I dress myself as an adult"" way. He had knee-high black socks with sandals. SANDALS.

But the pièce de résistance, and God help me I'm not making this up, was the hat. It was a fedora. Not a trilby that people call a fedora. An actual, full-brimmed, Indiana-Jones-if-he-gave-up-on-life FEDORA. It was dusty. Like visably dusty. Like it had been sitting on a shelf between uses and nobody had thought to maybe give it a wipe.

He spotted me, and his face lit up like a kid on Christmas morning. He waddled over to the booth with this huge grin, and that's when the smell hit me.

Oh God. The smell.

You know how sometimes you walk past a dumpster in August and you get that wave? That hot, wet wall of funk that seems to have weight and texture? Imagine that, but mixed with what I can only describe as fermented cheese and old pennies. It was LAYERED. Like an onion of stink. You'd get the initial blast of body odor, that sharp, acidic, ""I haven't worn deodorant since the Obama administration"" funk, and then underneath it there was something deeper and more sinister. Something biological. Something that suggested multiple systems were failing simultaniously.

It hit me in a wave as he slid into the booth across from me, and I physically had to fight the urge to lean back. The couple at the next table looked over. The woman made eye contact with me and I watched her soul leave her body in real time.

""Danny! A pleasure to finally meet in the flesh!"" He reached across the table to shake my hand and I noticed his fingernails were long. Not like, ""I forgot to trim them"" long. Like, intentionally long. With visible grime underneath them. I shook his hand because I was raised with manners and sometimes manners are a curse. His palm was damp. Not sweaty. DAMP. Like he'd been holding a wet sponge. I resisted the urge to wipe my hand on my jeans under the table. (I failed. I absolutely wiped my hand on my jeans under the table.)

""Hey, Theo! Nice to finally meet you,"" I said, because lying is a survival skill.

He took off the fedora and set it on the table. ON THE TABLE WHERE FOOD WOULD BE. And I got a full view of the hair situation. It was long, greasy, and pulled back into a ponytail that looked like it had the texture and moisture content of a used mop. His beard, and I use that term loosly, was patchy, wispy, and appeared to have... things in it. I didn't look closely enough to identify them. Some mysteries are better left unsolved.

""I must confess,"" he said, leaning forward conspiratorally, ""I was quite nervous about tonight. I've been on several dates from the app, but most men are so superficial. They can't see past the exterior to the mind beneath."" He tapped his temple and gave me this knowing look, like we were both in on some secret about the shallow nature of the gay community.

I smiled and nodded because what the hell else was I gonna do? I was trapped in a booth. The smell had formed a barricade. I was a prisoner of war at Koi Pond Japanese Restaurant.

We ordered food. He ordered three entrees. THREE. For himself. The waiter didn't even blink, bless that man's professionalism. While we waited, Theodore launched into a monologue about how most people couldn't appreciate ""true intellect"" and how society was designed to marginalize people who ""think differently."" I'm sitting there nodding along, doing that thing where you say ""mmhmm"" and ""oh totally"" every thirty seconds while your brain is running escape route calculations.

And then it happened.

The thing.

THE thing.

Theodore was in the middle of explaining to me why actually, if you think about it, the age of consent is ""a more nuanced topic than people give it credit for."" MASSIVE red flag, absolutely enormous, I know. Then he stopped mid-sentence. His face did this thing, like a small internal earthquake. His eyes got wide, his jaw shifted, and he made this sound. This awful, gutteral, deep-throat HKKKKKK sound. Like a cat hacking up a hairball, but wetter. More productive.

I watched in paralyzed horror as he coughed something up into his mouth. He worked it around for a second. I could see his jaw moving, his tongue probing. And then he reached into his mouth with his thumb and forefinger and extracted something.

It was small. Yellowish-white. About the size of a small pea.

A tonsil stone.

Now, if you don't know what tonsil stones are, I envy you. They're these little calcified chunks of bacteria, dead cells, and food debris that form in the crevices of your tonsils. They're relatively common and most people who get them discreetly deal with them in private, like a normal human being. They also smell like actual death. Like, concentrated, weaponized bad breath compressed into a tiny pellet of biological warfare.

Theodore did not discreetly deal with his in private.

Theodore held it up between his fingers and EXAMINED IT with a look of mild curiosity, like a scientist observing a specimen. And then, with the casualness of a man brushing lint off his sleeve, he reached over and wiped it on the wall next to our booth.

On. The. Wall.

He just... smeared it there. On the wall of this restaurant. This restaurant where people eat food. Where humans come to nourish themselves. He left a small yellowish streak on the paint and went right back to talking like absolutely nothing had happened.

""As I was saying, the problem with modern dating is""

""I'm sorry,"" I said, and my voice sounded like it was coming from very far away, ""did you just... put that on the wall?""

He looked at me with genuine confusion. ""Put what?""

""The... the thing. From your mouth. You just wiped it on the wall.""

""Oh, that?"" He laughed. LAUGHED. Like I'd pointed out he had sauce on his chin. ""Don't worry about it, it's just a tonsil stone. I get them all the time. They're totally natural.""

""On the WALL though?""

""It's fine, they clean the walls.""

THEY CLEAN THE WALLS. As if there's a guy at Koi Pond whose specific job is to go around scraping strangers' tonsil deposits off the dining room surfaces. As if this is an expected and accounted-for element of restaurant maintenence. I wanted to scream. I wanted to flip the table. I wanted to go back in time and slap the phone out of my own hand before I ever swiped right.

But I didn't do any of those things, because I am cursed with politeness and also I was in full fight-or-flight and my stupid body chose freeze.

The food arrived, and watching Theodore eat was its own circle of hell. He didn't use chopsticks. Fine, lots of people don't. But he used his fingers for things that were clearly meant to be eaten with utensils. Sushi? Fingers. Miso soup? He DRANK it straight from the bowl, and it dribbled down his beard in rivulets, mixing with whatever ecosystem was already thriving in there. He talked with his mouth full, spraying little particles of rice and fish across the table. I watched a grain of rice arc through the air in slow motion and land on my arm. I felt my whole body recoil.

At one point he picked up a piece of salmon sashimi, and I watched a strand of something stretch between his fingers and the fish like a tiny bridge of nightmares. Mucus? I don't know. I'm not a forensic scientist. He didn't notice. Or if he did, he didn't care.

He chewed with his mouth open, making these wet, smacking sounds that I can still hear if the room gets too quiet. Like someone stirring mac and cheese. But wetter. God, everything about this man was WET. How was he so damp?? It wasn't even hot in the restaurant!

At one point, a piece of tempura fell into his beard and he just... left it there. It hung there like a Christmas ornament for a solid five minutes before gravity claimed it and it fell onto the table. He picked it up and ate it. The woman at the next table had been sneaking horrified glances at us all night, and this was apparently her breaking point because I heard her whisper ""check please"" to the waiter with real urgency in her voice.

He ordered dessert. Mochi ice cream. He ate it in one bite. The whole thing, all three pieces, one after another. And then he LICKED THE PLATE. In the restaurant. In public. Where people could see him. Where God could see him. The waiter came by and Theodore handed back the plate which was now polished to a shine and glistening with saliva and said ""my compliments to the chef!"" with absolutely zero self-awareness that he had just committed a crime against dining.

I pushed my food around my plate and tried to figure out how to extract myself from this situation without being a complete asshole. Because despite everything, the smell, the tonsil stone, the fingernails, the tempura beard, some stupid part of my brain was still trying to be NICE. To not hurt his FEELINGS. I hate that part of my brain. That part of my brain is why I'm writing this story right now.

""So,"" Theodore said, bits of edamame visible between his teeth, ""I feel like we have a real connection. I don't open up to people easily, but there's something about you, Danny. You're not like other guys.""

Oh no.

""That's really sweet, Theo, but I""

""Most people can't handle me. I'm too intense, too intelligent. It intimidates them. But you... you GET me. I can tell.""

He reached across the table and put his hand on mine. The damp hand. The long-fingernail hand. I felt something gritty on his palm, like sand, except it wasn't sand. I don't know what it was. I don't WANT to know what it was.

""I think this could be something really special,"" he said, and his eyes were doing this intense, unblinking thing that made my skin crawl. ""I haven't felt this way since my last relationship.""

""When was that?"" I asked, gently extracting my hand.

""2016. She was a girl I met at a convention. We dated online for three months but she turned out to be a liar. Said she was moving to Japan and blocked me. Women, am I right?"" He paused. ""I mean, obviously I'm into men too, I'm on Grindr. I'm actually pansexual, because I don't believe in limiting my love to arbitrary constructs."" He said this with the energy of someone who'd rehearsed it in a mirror.

""Cool, cool,"" I said, already mentally composing my escape text to my friend Marissa. We had a system. If I texted her the eggplant emoji followed by the ambulance emoji, she'd call me with a fake emergency. I pulled out my phone under the table. Sent.

Thirty seconds later, my phone rang.

""Oh no, I gotta take this,"" I said, trying to look concerned. ""Hello? ...What? Oh my God. Yeah, yeah, I'll be right there.""

I hung up and gave Theodore my best ""devastated"" face. ""I'm so sorry, my friend just got in a car accident. I have to go.""

The look on Theodore's face went through about seven emotions in two seconds. Concern, suspicion, hurt, anger, and then the worst one. Understanding. Not actual understanding. The performative kind. The ""I'm going to be SO gracious about this because I am a GENTLEMAN"" kind.

""Of course, of course. Your friend needs you. That's what I love about you, Danny. You're so caring."" He stood up, and I realized he expected a hug. He was moving towards me with his arms open, that smell leading the charge like a medieval army's first wave.

I did the side-pat. You know the one. The quick, one-armed, minimal-contact side pat that says ""I acknowledge your physical presence but I'd rather be anywhere else."" Even that brief contact transferred enough odor onto my jacket that I had to wash it twice when I got home. My JACKET. From a SIDE PAT.

""Let's do this again soon!"" he called after me as I speed-walked to my car. ""I'll text you!""

I got in my car, locked the doors like he was going to chase me, and sat there for a full minute just breathing through my mouth and processing what had just happened. My hands were shaking. Not from fear exactly, but from the sheer overwhelming sensory assault my body had just endured. I looked at my hand, the one he'd shaken, and I swear I could still feel the dampness. The phantom moisture of Theodore's greeting. I fumbled through my glove compartment until I found an old bottle of hand sanitizer and used approximately half of it.

Then I drove home. I drove home with the windows down even though it was forty degrees outside because I could still smell him in my jacket. The odor had clung to me like a desperate ex. It had permeated the fabric on a molecular level during that brief side-pat and now my car smelled like a preview of what his apartment probably smelled like. Spoiler alert: I would eventually find out exactly what his apartment smelled like. But we're not there yet. We're not READY for that yet.

I got home and stripped at the door. Threw my jacket directly into the washing machine, set it to hot, and then stood in the shower for twenty minutes at a temperature that could be classified as ""punishment."" I scrubbed. I scrubbed like I was trying to remove a top layer of skin. I used an entire loofa's worth of body wash. And even after all that, standing there pink and raw and steaming, I could STILL catch phantom whiffs. My therapist would later tell me this was probably psychosomatic. My nose would beg to differ.

After the decontamination shower, I sat on my couch in clean sweatpants with my wet hair dripping onto a towel, and texted Marissa.

**Danny:** I need you to know that was the worst experience of my life and I am including the time I broke my arm in 4th grade

**Marissa:** that bad???

**Danny:** He wiped a tonsil stone on the wall of the restaurant Marissa. ON THE WALL.

**Marissa:** I'm sorry WHAT

**Danny:** Like a booger. But worse. So much worse.

**Marissa:** oh my god danny

**Danny:** I can still smell him. I think the smell is IN me now. I think it's part of me.

**Marissa:** block him. Block him right now.

And she was right. She was so right. I should have blocked him right then and there. I should have blocked him, deleted the app, thrown my phone into the river, and started a new life as a hermit in the mountains.

But I didn't.

Because I'm an idiot.

I told myself I'd do it in the morning. I was tired, I was traumatized, and I just wanted to go to sleep and forget the whole thing happened. I figured one night wouldn't matter. He'd probably move on to someone else by morning anyway, right? Guys on Grindr have short attention spans. He'd find some other poor soul to subject to his tonsil stones and his damp hands and his three-entree orders and his ""nuanced"" opinions about consent laws.

I fell asleep telling myself it was over.

I woke up to 47 messages.

FORTY. SEVEN.

They started normal-ish:

**11:47 PM** GentleSir\_Seeks\_More: I had such a wonderful time tonight. I hope your friend is okay! <33

**11:52 PM:** I just wanted you to know that I felt a real spark between us. I don't say that lightly.

**12:03 AM:** Are you still at the hospital? I could come bring you coffee if you need support!

Then they started to shift:

**12:34 AM:** Hey, just checking in. You haven't responded and I'm getting a little worried.

**12:51 AM:** Danny?

**1:15 AM:** I know you're probably busy but a simple response would be courteous. I gave you a really nice evening and I think I deserve at least an acknowledgment.

**1:33 AM:** Fine. I see how it is.

**1:34 AM:** You know what, no. I'm not going to be passive aggressive about this. I'm going to be direct. I thought we had something real and the fact that you can't even text me back is honestly really hurtful.

**1:47 AM:** I looked up your friend on Facebook and I can't find any posts about a car accident. Interesting.

Oh. Oh no.

**2:15 AM:** I'm not accusing you of lying. I'm just saying it's suspicious.

**2:16 AM:** Actually you know what, I AM accusing you of lying. Nobody's friend got in a car accident. That was an excuse. I've seen this before.

**2:30 AM:** Do you know how hard it is for someone like me to put themselves out there? Do you have ANY idea? I was vulnerable with you tonight. I shared my authentic self and you THREW IT IN MY FACE.

**2:45 AM:** I bet you're one of those guys who only cares about looks. Typical. You're all the same. You want some muscled up airhead who can't even discuss philosophy? Fine. Go ahead. See how that works out for you.

**3:00 AM:** I'm sorry. That was harsh. I didn't mean it. I'm just hurt. Please talk to me.

**3:01 AM:** Danny please.

**3:15 AM:** I've been crying for an hour.

**3:22 AM:** You made me feel like I mattered and then you just left.

**3:30 AM:** I can't believe I wasted my one nice shirt on you.

(It was not nice. For the record. It was not a nice shirt.)

**3:45 AM:** This is your last chance. If you don't respond by morning I'm going to assume you're just like everyone else.

**4:00 AM:** Fine.

**4:01 AM:** FINE.

**4:15 AM:** I hope you know that you are a genuinly terrible person.

**4:30 AM:** I gave you EVERYTHING and this is what I get.

**4:31 AM:** I even wore my good fedora.

His GOOD fedora. The dusty one was the GOOD ONE. That implies the existence of a BAD fedora and I cannot even begin to imagine what that looks like. I don't WANT to imagine it. My therapist is already earning her money as it is.

**5:00 AM:** You know what, I forgive you. I'm a bigger person than this. (No pun intended.) When you're ready to apologize, I'll be here. I'll always be here for you Danny.

**5:15 AM:** <3

**5:16 AM:** Also I should mention that I saw your workplace listed on your Instagram. Cool brewery! Maybe I'll stop by sometime to say hi :)

I stared at that last message for a long time.

A very, very long time.

My workplace. He found my Instagram. He knew where I worked. And he'd phrased it so casually, so lightly, with that little smiley face, like it was a totally normal and not at all threatening thing to say after sending someone 47 unhinged messages between midnight and dawn. That's the thing about guys like Theodore. They weaponize casualness. They say something that would make a restraining order lawyer's ears perk up, and they tuck it inside a smiley face so if you call them on it, they can say ""I was just being friendly! God, why is everyone so paranoid?""

I blocked him.

Finally, FINALLY, I blocked him on Grindr. Then I went to Instagram and blocked him there too. Then Facebook. Then Twitter. Every platform I could think of. I went through my privacy settings on everything like I was preparing for cyber war. I set everything to private. I removed my workplace from my bio. I even googled my own name to see what came up and went through the first three pages of results making sure there was nothing that could lead him to my door. I felt paranoid. I felt crazy. Marissa would later tell me I wasn't being paranoid enough.

I built a digital fortress around myself and I genuinley, naively, STUPIDLY thought that would be the end of it. That a normal human being, upon being blocked on every platform, would get the message (pun intended) and move on with their life. That even someone as socially oblivious as Theodore would understand that a block means ""leave me alone.""

But Theodore, as I was about to learn, did not operate by the rules of normal human beings. Theodore operated by the rules of Theodore. And in Theodore's world, a block wasn't a rejection. It was an obstacle. A test. A quest, if you will, that a true gentleman must overcome to prove his devotion.

Marissa called me that morning and I read her the messages. She was silent for so long I thought the call had dropped.

""Danny,"" she said, in that voice she uses when she's about to say something I don't want to hear. ""This isn't funny-weird anymore. This is scary-weird.""

""It's fine,"" I said. ""I blocked him. It's over.""

""Danny, he found your Instagram in the middle of the night after one date. That's not normal behavior. That's not even close to normal behavior.""

""People stalk people's socials after dates all the time,"" I said, which is true, but even as I said it I knew this was different. Checking someone's Instagram is one thing. Mentioning their workplace at 5 AM in the middle of a 47-message spiral is something else entirely.

""Just... be careful, okay? And if he shows up at your job, you call the police.""

""He's not gonna show up at my job, Marissa. He's just a weird dude who can't handle rejection. He'll find someone else to fixate on by next week.""

She made a sound that communicated more doubt than words ever could.

It was not over.

It was not even close to over.

But that, my friends, is a story for Part 2.

**TL;DR: Went on a Grindr date with a man who wiped a tonsil stone on a restaurant wall, ate tempura out of his own beard, had opinions about age of consent laws, and then sent me 47 messages in five hours when I escaped the date early. He found my Instagram and knows where I work. I blocked him but I have a bad feeling about this.**

**Part 2 coming soon. It gets worse. So much worse.**",1,1771325644.0,ReddXReads,0,1.0,False

In today’s digital world, customers don’t search randomly. They search with purpose. When someone types “best bakery near me” or “digital marketing training institute in Pune,” they are not just browsing—they are ready to take action. This is where [**Local SEO**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/pcKaSXEFm7eBMgxN9) becomes powerful.

Local SEO is not just about ranking on Google. It is about connecting your business with people who are actively looking for your products or services in your area. These people are called **high-intent leads**—and they are more likely to convert into paying customers.

Let’s understand how Local SEO works and how it can help your business generate high-quality leads.

# What Is Local SEO?

Local SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is the process of optimizing your online presence so your business appears in local search results.

For example:

* “Best salon in Pune”
* “[Digital marketing courses in Pune](https://victoriousdigital.in/)”
* “Digital marketing training institute in Pune”
* “Restaurant near me”

When someone searches like this, Google shows:

* Google Map listings (Local Pack)
* Business profiles
* Reviews
* Website links

If your business is optimized properly, you can appear in these top positions.

# What Are High-Intent Leads?

High-intent leads are people who:

* Are actively searching for a solution
* Have a clear buying intention
* Are ready to contact, visit, or purchase

For example, someone searching:

* “Enroll in digital marketing courses in Pune”
* “Affordable dentist near me”
* “Best gym membership in my area”

These searches show buying intent. These users are not just researching—they are ready to act.

Local SEO helps you capture these ready-to-buy customers.

# Why Local SEO Is More Powerful Than Traditional Marketing

Traditional marketing like flyers, newspaper ads, and hoardings reaches a broad audience. But not everyone is interested.

Local SEO is different because:

* It targets people already searching
* It brings organic traffic
* It builds trust through reviews
* It gives long-term results

Instead of chasing customers, customers find you.

# How Local SEO Generates High-Intent Leads

# 1. Optimizing Your Google Business Profile

Your Google Business Profile (GBP) is the foundation of Local SEO.

When someone searches locally, Google shows business listings with:

* Name
* Address
* Phone number
* Reviews
* Ratings
* Photos
* Directions

If your profile is:

* Fully updated
* Has accurate details
* Contains business keywords
* Has positive reviews

Then your chances of getting calls and inquiries increase.

Many training institutes get daily calls just from an optimized Google profile.

# 2. Targeting Local Keywords

Keyword research is important in Local SEO.

Instead of targeting general keywords like:

* “digital marketing course”

You target local keywords like:

* “digital marketing courses in Pune”
* “digital marketing training institute in Pune”
* “best SEO classes in Pune with placement”

These keywords have:

* Lower competition
* Higher conversion rate
* Local buyer intent

When your website content includes these keywords naturally, Google understands your location relevance.

# 3. Ranking in Google’s Local 3-Pack

The Local 3-Pack is the top 3 business listings shown in Google Maps results.

If your business ranks here:

* Visibility increases
* Trust increases
* Clicks increase
* Calls increase

Most users click on businesses in the top 3 results. If your business appears there, you automatically generate more high-intent leads.

# 4. Building Local Trust Through Reviews

People trust reviews more than advertisements.

When someone searches for:  
“Best digital marketing training institute in Pune”

They check:

* Star rating
* Number of reviews
* Student feedback
* Photos
* Responses from owner

Positive reviews increase:

* Credibility
* Trust
* Conversion rate

Encouraging satisfied customers or students to leave reviews is a powerful Local SEO strategy.

# 5. Mobile Search Growth

Most local searches happen on mobile phones.

Examples:

* “Coffee shop near me”
* “Marketing course near me”
* “Digital marketing courses in Pune with placement”

Users searching from mobile are often:

* Nearby
* Ready to visit
* Ready to call

If your website is mobile-friendly and loads fast, you get more inquiries.

# 6. Location-Based Landing Pages

If your business serves multiple areas, you can create location-specific pages.

For example:

* Digital marketing course in Pune
* Digital marketing course in Pimpri
* Digital marketing course in Hinjewadi

Each page should:

* Include local keywords
* Mention local landmarks
* Show testimonials from that area

This improves your visibility in different locations and increases high-intent inquiries.

# 7. Local Content Marketing

Creating local content helps you rank better.

You can write blogs like:

* “Why Choose Digital Marketing Courses in Pune?”
* “Career Opportunities After Joining a Digital Marketing Training Institute in Pune”
* “Top Skills You Learn in SEO Training in Pune”

Local content:

* Improves authority
* Brings targeted traffic
* Builds trust with local audience

When content answers real local queries, Google ranks it higher.

# 8. Local Backlinks

Backlinks from local websites improve trust signals.

Examples:

* Local news websites
* Business directories
* Local event websites
* Educational portals

When Google sees local links pointing to your website, it understands that your business is relevant in that city.

# 9. NAP Consistency

NAP means:

* Name
* Address
* Phone number

Your NAP must be consistent across:

* Website
* Google profile
* Justdial
* Sulekha
* IndiaMart
* Other directories

Inconsistent information reduces trust and rankings.

# 10. Voice Search Optimization

Voice searches are increasing rapidly.

People now ask:

* “Which is the best digital marketing training institute in Pune?”
* “Where can I learn digital marketing near me?”

Voice searches are:

* Conversational
* Location-based
* Intent-driven

Optimizing your content in a natural question-answer format helps you capture voice-based high-intent leads.

# Benefits of Local SEO for Businesses

Here are some key benefits:

# 1. Higher Conversion Rate

Local searches have high buying intent, so conversion rates are higher compared to general website traffic.

# 2. Cost-Effective Marketing

Local SEO is more affordable than paid ads and gives long-term results.

# 3. Better ROI

Because leads are targeted and ready to act, your return on investment improves.

# 4. Competitive Advantage

Many small businesses still ignore Local SEO. If you optimize early, you stay ahead.

# 5. Strong Brand Authority

When your business appears multiple times in search results, users trust your brand more.

# Real-Life Example

Imagine a student in Pune searching:

“Best digital marketing courses in Pune with placement”

If your website:

* Is optimized
* Appears in Google Maps
* Has 4.8+ rating
* Has detailed course information
* Shows testimonials

There is a high chance the student will:

* Call you
* Visit your website
* Fill an inquiry form
* Enroll in your course

That is the power of Local SEO—it brings people who are ready to take action.

# Local SEO vs Paid Ads

Many businesses depend only on paid ads.

But:

* Ads stop when budget stops
* Cost per lead increases over time

Local SEO:

* Gives long-term traffic
* Builds organic authority
* Reduces dependency on ads

The best strategy is combining both—but Local SEO should be your foundation.

# How to Start Local SEO Today

Here is a simple action plan:

1. Create or optimize Google Business Profile
2. Add correct business details
3. Collect genuine reviews
4. Use local keywords in website content
5. Create location-based blogs
6. Build local backlinks
7. Ensure mobile-friendly website
8. Maintain NAP consistency

Consistency is key. Results may take a few months, but once rankings improve, leads grow steadily.

# Final Thoughts

Local SEO is not just about ranking higher on Google. It is about attracting people who are already looking for your services.

High-intent leads mean:

* Better conversion
* More inquiries
* More sales
* Strong business growth

If you run a local business, coaching institute, or service company, Local SEO can transform your lead generation strategy.

Especially for businesses targeting specific areas—like digital marketing courses in Pune or a [digital marketing training institute in Pune](https://victoriousdigital.in/)—Local SEO is not optional anymore. It is essential.

Start optimizing today, stay consistent, and watch how quality leads start coming to your business naturally.

Local SEO doesn’t just bring traffic.  
It brings customers who are ready to say **yes**.",1,1771325613.0,u_Complex_Oil_772,0,1.0,False
1r72wrd,https://www.reddit.com/r/WidowsMovingForward/comments/1r72wrd/turnaround_an_ongoing_story_of_coming_back/,"Turnaround, an ongoing story of coming back.","I have kept a journal ever since I found myself mired in the muck of the brain tumor diagnosis and I lost my wife to glioblastoma going on 4 years now. The following is my writing, cleaned up concerning this wonderful, new and exciting relationship that came out of nowhere. I tell this special person we are writing a new love story. I write in this in my style as I do not follow grammar or spelling rules too well. 

This pretty much all from day to day journaling and is a mere fraction of the story that is unfolding. I want to give all widows and widowers a sense of hope that life can come back to us. Often unexpectedly. Each day we add to this story.



The Story Unfolding:

All it took was five seconds of our lips touching. Five seconds of feeling each other’s breathing interrupted. Five seconds of lips meeting lips for me to know that this woman was all I ever could ask for in life. In less than a week after meeting in person for the first time, 5 days to be exact, I felt a connection I never thought possible. I felt such comfort, such ease in the presence of a woman I could measure hours on my fingers that would normally take weeks and months and perhaps even years to do so otherwise. Only 9 days since she sent me a friend request on Facebook and I accepted. Our text sessions that seem to never end, for several days in the row. We began to share personal info, share pictures of loss and heartache, pictures of excitement and happiness. Pictures and words in getting to each other’s lives. Those first few magical few days that were indeed timeless as if time had stopped and we could not wait to begin again, each morning.



I knew of her for years. I would see her on occasion at the bar restaurant she and her late husband had started. I would stop by for an occasional lunch with my guy friends and she be there, in the background. Her silver white hair flowing around her head as she wisp around the place. I admit it outright, I have a fondness, a weakness of silver hair, likely back to childhood with my great aunts who both had such hair. She always dressed in her own style, often with custom altered pants and tops she sewed herself, some she bought. A calm, poised presence I could see and sense from across the room. She moved elegantly around the room, the Grand Dame of her domain. I noted this and moved on with my life. A fantasy at best, as men do, not knowing how years later our very paths would cross.



Years passed and I persevered thru caring and losing my wife to glioblastoma. The ordeal drained my heart and soul where I could not see myself in a relationship. Life was even harsher for her. This wistful beauty of poise and grace having her heart and soul ripped out by a loss of her only daughter and in same year, a terrible heart attack on her husband, her partner in life. He had been burden with diabetes that was growing worse each year and she remained a stalwart partner, a loving and supportive partner at his side, and in time losing him piece by piece and until finally succumbing to the disease years later. Nearly eight years until his last breath in their living room, a day before hospice was being contacted.

She sat alone with him before calling any one. Holding his hand, kissing his forehead. Saying her last goodbyes in privacy. Similar to my own good byes to my late wife after I sent the supportive friends from our bedroom where she layed in the hospital bed. I said the same words to this woman I loved for 30 yrs, who took her last breath in my arms. Five minutes alone to hold and kiss her for the very last time. 



She still had her son and now two businesses to concentrate on along with a circle of faithful and caring friends, many many lifelong who saw all these assaults on her heart and soul. Friends that always be at her side whenever needed. Friends who loved her and her late husband. She settled in a routine of her own making, her plan and began to live life as herself and not as a partner of her late husband. She became more carefree and happy in her own way with the confidence that she can indeed live alone and find contentment with life, content with being able to live it alone and still smile and still laugh. She has the confidence of KNOWING.



One night in the business she owned she overheard a friend talk about “Poppie” and how he may walk her down the aisle at her wedding. Being curious she asked about this Poppie and her friend said, well its Bob. This new friend of mine also cleans my house. I was not aware that we had a mutual friend with her. She goes on to tell her that I find her to be really attractive. She asked to see my photo and our friend complied. For life of me, I do not recall that conversation or noted she knew her as well. So later that Sunday night she sent me a friend request.



I woke up early that Monday morning as I always do, near 4am. Take care of cats, make a cup of coffee, check email and Facebook where I saw a friend request from her. I nearly snorted my coffee in surprise, in shock totally unexpected. No way I thought. Time froze. I was shocked, perplex, a bit nervous, no definitely nervous. I hit confirm. A couple hours later, perhaps no later than 6am, her first Facebook messenger text hit me. I had posted a photo of no-bean chili on my Facebook and she inquired about my recipe. I responded and then the text floodgates open up. Hours and hours of texting that day and several others that followed. Often starting early in the morning and some lasting until 10pm at night.

I was overwhelmed, shocked, happy that some how we began this level of communication with such a degree of closeness. We opened up about out lives, we sent pictures, some going back as far as high school. We shared our moments of grief and pain, we shared our moments of happiness. We talked about our losses at such a high level of trust and calmness. Like we have known each other for years. I finally suggested we exchange phone numbers. No hesitation on her part. The the first call was made between us. I am not sure who called first. I was still in awe and in shock.

Then I heard her voice, a fairly deep toned voice for a woman and then I heard her laugh. A wonderful laugh, almost immediate laugh, a haughty laugh.  We talked and talked. She told me right off we shared the same birthday but a year apart as she is one year older. Coincidences happens but not in my world, I do not believe in coincidences. Not really. Too many stars have to align to pull it off. I am not sure how late we talked that night or the next day. Again, it was timeless. Magical.",3,1771325583.0,WidowsMovingForward,1,1.0,False
1r72wm2,https://www.reddit.com/r/WiiParty/comments/1r72wm2/whats_purpose_of_life/,what's purpose of life ?,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

However there is a one issue so far and that is my best friend, she is 23f and we have been friends since I was in my second year of college. We have been through a lot together and helped each other through tough times, I consider her one of my closest friends and confidants and I trust her with my life. Ever since the outset my girlfriend has been visibly uncomfortable with her around, she claims it was because I described her as very attractive to my other male friends, which is true, my friend dated one of my best friends and current housemate for 3 years, and has had advances from most of my male friends - however this was mentioned only for contextualising her relationship with some of my other friends, not me just out of nowhere mentioning that point. Now, there has never been, nor will there ever be anything of that nature between us because she is A) my friend and B) another good friends ex, so I have no interest in anything romantic with her at all. My girlfriend references a previous situationship she was in where the guy told her not to worry about a female best friend with the same colour hair as my friend, and then cheated on her or ended the situationship to be with that best friend, and she wants to set boundaries around my friend with me now as a result, i.e letting her know if we stay in the same place (there was a party at my friends house that my girlfriend was not in attendance of where my friends and myself stayed over, I slept on the couch in the living room and the best friend in question was in one of the spare rooms) now don't get me wrong I can understand this in a situation like that, but everytime I even so much as mention her name, my girlfriends demeanour visibly changes, and she very clearly is suspicious of me and her even though, aside from a throwaway comment, I have been completely transparent with her and told her over and over again that I do not have a romantic interest in this woman, she is my friend and thats the end of it. I have told her she is free to look at my phone at any time as I have nothing to hide, although she always says she doesn't need to do that as she trusts me. I find myself more and more just not mentioning my friend whenever there is news because my girlfriend gets cold and aggravated anytime I even mention her name. She also mentioned wanting to accompany me anytime I am going to be in my friends company which like, if the situation allows I of course have no issue with, but I am enrolled in and commute to a part time masters degree in the same area as my friend works, its weird to me that I would have to turn down, say, a coffee with her when I am waiting on my train, just so I can arrange for a time when my girlfriend is free to come with me.

I don't think its strange to think this is unfair on me to transplant baggage from a previous situation and apply it to me when it couldn't be further from the truth. I want to be able to mention my best friend and stuff that is happening with her, and I hate how her behaviour makes me want to not talk about her, mention her, tell stories featuring her. Its been really bothering me and I am planning on having a discussion with her surrounding this, because I hate the insinuation that I would cheat on her, or would even enter into a relationship with her if I had feelings for my best friend, but I wanted to sanity check with some other folks so that I could make sure I wasn't going crazy? and and all feedback/criticisim welcome.",2,1771325372.0,relationship_advice,9,1.0,False

He (20M) has been genuinely nothing but chronically miserable since he met her (19F), last week was the last straw. It was the 3rd time he asked for me for advice on his doomed relationship. The first time was her ditching him to go hang out with her co workers on a planned date night, alright shitty thing to do, otherwise whatever, the second time was her accusing him of trying to cheat on him, as that's what she would do (Make up a story of going for coffee with a friend) to cheat, (Wtf) she was proven wrong via a snapchat.

This most recent time? He caught her with one of her co workers PLAY FIGHTING IN THE STREET WITH HER PHONE. When he confronted her, she just smiled and said, babe he's a friend. Bare in mind, she finished work and was SUPPOSED to meet him halfway onto the path to his house, she went a different route with thjs co worker, knowingly to a bus stop, that goes to hers. She reluctantly gets on a bus with him to go to his place. This is all by what I have been told.

He asks me for advice on this then calls me bias and jealous when I say she treats you like dirt, and that he deserves better, he has turned into a abhorrent miserable thing. Going as far as to tell me to ""pack it in"" when I liked a fucking INSTAGRAM NOTE of hers. Honestly, I'm thinking of cutting my hair a bit and leaving it round his so she can find it, genuinely cannot stand him or her anymore. I cleaned his house for him, so she could move in, of which she changed her mind because her co worker can just drive her around, and I've had nothing but shit recently.",1,1771325232.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

Thanks to Deskflow, I only need to jiggle one mouse, but I need to jiggle it (or press a key) to wake up the three systems I work on every day.  
I've got a PIR sensor by my desk, so being able to send a wake signal to my systems should be easy - why shouldn't I have the screens fully woken by the time I sit down at my desk?

Turns out it's a bit complex - I've got Windows and Ubuntu systems here, and the HA Desktop Companion and HA Linux Companion didn't offer much in the way of simulating a mouse jiggle. There's also the logic in terms of when those systems might be turning off their displays, and avoiding annoying extra jiggles when the sensor updates while working.

So I ended up making [ha-display-wake](https://github.com/joes3029/ha-display-wake) \- a simple listener for Linux and Windows that will connect to MQTT, listen to the sensor you specify, and then decide whether to simulate a mouse jiggle based on the screen timeout parameters it read and you confirmed when running for the first time, invoking the setup process.

It'll install itself as a service or scheduled task, and quietly just... turn the screens on  when the sensor updates. No need to wake anything up manually anymore.

I've tried to keep it as simple as possible and it's under an MIT license. I'd love to hear if this is useful for others, and your feedback.",6,1771324971.0,homeassistant,4,0.88,False
