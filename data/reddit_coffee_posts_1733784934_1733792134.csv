--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Teeth whitening has become a popular choice for those looking to enhance their smiles. Many people turn to professional treatments or at-home kits in search of brighter, whiter teeth. The impact of teeth whitening before and after results is striking and can significantly alter a person’s confidence and appearance. Let's explore what these transformations look like and what expectations you might have when undergoing this treatment.

### Understanding Teeth Whitening

Teeth whitening involves whitening products that help remove stains and discoloration from the enamel. The most common methods include:

- **Professional Whitening:** This is done in a dental office and typically gives the quickest and most dramatic results.
- **At-Home Kits:** These kits, available at pharmacies, often contain lower concentrations of whitening agents and may take longer to show results.
- **Whitening Strips:** These are small, flexible strips coated with a gel that adheres to the teeth.
- **Whitening Toothpaste:** These products might contain mild abrasives and gentle chemical agents for stain removal.

### Transformations: What to Expect

When people undergo teeth whitening, they often share their before and after photos. The differences are usually clear. You can see brighter, more radiant teeth which can enhance overall facial aesthetics. Some transformations include:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Brighter Smile:** Many individuals experience a noticeable increase in the brightness of their teeth, making their smile appear healthier and more vibrant.
- **Boost in Self-Confidence:** People typically report feeling more confident and ready to smile after their treatment.
- **Younger Appearance:** Whiter teeth are often associated with youthfulness, contributing to a fresher look.
- **Improved Social Interactions:** Many find that smiling more frequently leads to better social interactions and a more engaging personality.

### Managing Expectations

While the results of teeth whitening can be impressive, it's essential to manage your expectations before undergoing treatment. Here are some critical points to consider:

- **Results Vary:** Not everyone will achieve the same level of whiteness. Results can depend on the initial color of your teeth and the method chosen.
- **Duration of Whiteness:** The effects of whitening treatments are not permanent. Depending on your lifestyle choices, you may need to maintain your results through touch-ups.
- **Possible Sensitivity:** Some people experience tooth sensitivity after whitening. It’s essential to consult your dentist if this occurs.
- **Stain Prevention:** After whitening, eating certain foods and drinks can lead to staining. Avoiding coffee, tea, red wine, and smoking can help maintain the results longer.

### Before and After Considerations

Communicating with your dentist is vital before your whitening treatment. They can assess your dental health and let you know what to expect in your before and after results. Here are a few things to keep in mind:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Dental Health Assessment:** Ensure that your teeth and gums are healthy to get the best outcomes.
- **Realistic Goals:** Understand your natural tooth color and what whitening can realistically achieve.
- **Photo Documentation:** Take before and after photos to visually track your progress and make the transformation more concrete.


The impact of teeth whitening can be transformative, enhancing both your smile and confidence. It’s essential to approach the process with clear expectations and an understanding of what whitening can achieve. With a variety of options available, you can find a method that suits your lifestyle and goals. Just remember, a brighter smile can lead to a brighter you!

Natural vs. Professional Teeth Whitening: Comparing Results and Methods
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to achieving a brighter smile, many people find themselves torn between natural teeth whitening methods and professional treatments. Both options have their pros and cons, but understanding the differences can help you make the best choice for your needs. Let's compare these two approaches, focusing on their methods and the results you can expect.

### Natural Teeth Whitening Methods

Natural teeth whitening has become increasingly popular. The allure of using everyday items draws many people in due to their low cost and simplicity. Here’s a list of some common natural methods:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Baking Soda:** This common kitchen ingredient can effectively remove surface stains. By mixing it with water to create a paste, you can gently scrub your teeth.
- **Activated Charcoal:** Some individuals swear by this black powder. It’s thought to absorb toxins and stains on your teeth.
- **Hydrogen Peroxide:** Often found in household first aid kits, hydrogen peroxide can serve as a natural bleaching agent. Diluting it with water can make it safer for use on your teeth.
- **Coconut Oil Pulling:** This ancient practice involves swishing coconut oil around in your mouth for about 15-20 minutes. It may help reduce stains and improve oral health.
- **Fruits and Vegetables:** Certain fruits, like strawberries and oranges, have enzymes that may help whiten your teeth, while crunchy vegetables like apples can help scrub away plaque.

Despite the appeal of natural methods, the results can be subtle and often take longer to materialize. Depending on the severity of your stain, you may not achieve the bright smile you hope for.

### Professional Teeth Whitening Techniques

On the other hand, professional teeth whitening treatments are conducted by dentists and typically yield more noticeable results in a shorter amount of time. Here are some popular professional methods:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **In-Office Whitening:** Using high-concentration bleaching agents along with specialized lights, this method can lighten your teeth several shades in just one visit.
- **Take-Home Kits:** Many dentists provide custom-fitted trays and whitening gel that you can use at home. These kits can still achieve significant whitening, but the results take longer than in-office procedures.
- **Zoom Whitening:** This is a specific type of in-office whitening that uses a branded light technology to enhance the whitening effect, potentially lightening teeth in about an hour.

Professional whitening typically offers immediate and more dramatic results compared to natural methods. However, they can be more expensive, so consider your budget when deciding.

### Comparing Results

When it comes to teeth whitening, the end result is essential. Here’s a comparison of what you can expect from both methods:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
<table> <tr> <th>Aspect</th> <th>Natural Whitening</th> <th>Professional Whitening</th> </tr> <tr> <td>Cost</td> <td>Low cost (usually less than $20)</td> <td>Higher cost (avg. $300 - $1000)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Time to See Results</td> <td>Weeks or months</td> <td>Immediate (1-2 hours)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Effectiveness</td> <td>Subtle changes</td> <td>Significant changes</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Overall Safety</td> <td>Generally safe but may cause sensitivity</td> <td>Very safe when supervised by a professional</td> </tr></table>

Ultimately, the choice between natural and professional teeth whitening depends on your preferences, budget, and how quickly you want results. If you prefer a simple and low-cost solution, natural methods might be your best bet. However, if you want immediate and astounding results, investing in professional whitening could be worth it.

As you make your decision, consider what matters most to you. Whether you choose natural or professional methods, maintaining proper oral hygiene will help keep your smile bright and beautiful over time.

### Conclusion

Teeth whitening can significantly alter your smile, providing a boost in confidence and enhancing your overall appearance. The transformations seen in before-and-after photos are not just striking; they often highlight just how effective the treatment can be, which is why many individuals pursue this cosmetic option. Understanding what to expect from teeth whitening is crucial. The degree of change varies based on original tooth color, selected method, and even the individual's unique dental structure.

When comparing natural and professional teeth whitening methods, it’s clear that both possess distinct advantages. Natural options, often involving home remedies like baking soda or coconut oil, can be gentle and safe but may deliver more gradual results. On the other hand, professional treatments provide quicker and more noticeable outcomes due to their stronger formulations, though they require a monetary investment and should be performed under dental supervision for optimal safety.

Ultimately, whether you opt for a natural approach or seek professional assistance, it’s essential to consider your personal goals and oral health. Choosing the right method can help you achieve the smile transformation you desire while aligning with your lifestyle. Regular maintenance and good oral hygiene post-whitening can help you sustain your results longer. Armed with the right knowledge, you can make an informed choice that leads to a brighter, happier smile, enhancing not just your appearance but your self-esteem as well.

I stumbled across a post by someone who had a way of writing that felt personal, raw, and oddly magnetic. The post wasn’t particularly remarkable—some musings about modern dating—but it drew me in. Something about their tone and the small glimpses of their personality made me curious.

Their account wasn’t filled with selfies or explicit personal details, but it told a story. They wrote about their love for music that speaks to the soul, their thoughts on politics and how it shapes identity, and their frustration with how surface-level connections often feel. Their comments were thoughtful, sometimes biting, but always eloquent. It was like reading the diary of someone I was sure I’d want to know.

The post that caught my eye might even be deleted by now—it wasn’t the post itself but their Reddit history that kept me glued. Over time, I pieced together little breadcrumbs they’d left. They shared stories about moments that mattered to them, commented on threads that revealed their sharp sense of humor, and occasionally posted snippets of introspection that hinted at a deeply creative mind.

I don’t know what compelled me to keep digging. It wasn’t about finding out who they were, exactly, but more about wanting to see if someone who expressed themselves so beautifully online could be real. Eventually, with a little detective work, I found their Instagram.

They were stunning. Not in the “model perfect” way, but in the way their photos radiated warmth and authenticity. Their bio was short, their captions funny and thoughtful, and their pictures of sunsets and candid moments added texture to the person I’d imagined. I couldn’t help myself. I sent them a DM.

From Reddit Curiosity to Real-Life Connection

When I messaged them, I didn’t overthink it. I started with something casual, like I’d stumbled on their profile randomly. To my surprise, they replied almost instantly, and our conversation flowed effortlessly. Within a few days, we agreed to meet for coffee.

The date was… something special. We talked about life, dreams, and the strange ways we try to navigate this chaotic world. The topics were all over the place—art, society, music, love, even the absurdities of our daily routines. They had a way of speaking that made everything sound like poetry, even the most mundane observations. I found myself captivated by not just what they said but how they said it.

It felt like we had known each other for years, even though I’d only been following their Reddit posts for weeks. I didn’t mention Reddit, of course. How could I? It felt too surreal to admit, and I didn’t want to ruin the moment.

The Reddit Post That Changed Everything

A day after our date, I logged onto Reddit and saw a post that made my stomach drop. It was from them. They didn’t name me or give away specific details, but the title made it clear: they were rating our date. And it wasn’t exactly glowing.

They described it as “nice, but maybe too nice.” They mentioned feeling like something was missing, like I wasn’t quite the adventurous type they were looking for. Reading their words hurt, but it also made me laugh. Here I was, thinking we had just shared one of the best evenings of my life, and they were posting about how I seemed “too safe.”

Still, I wasn’t ready to give up.

Proving Myself Beyond “Safe”

Over the next few weeks, I focused on building something real with them. I didn’t try to “prove” I wasn’t safe—whatever that meant—but I made sure to show up as my truest self. Our conversations deepened, and we started spending more time together, exploring not just the city but each other’s minds.

They started opening up in ways that felt even more intimate than their Reddit posts. We talked about our fears, our ambitions, the things that make us laugh, and the things that break our hearts. It wasn’t always easy, but it was always worth it. Slowly but surely, I realized the “meh” they had posted about was evolving into something more.

Four Months Later—and a Confession

Now, after four months together, I can confidently say we’re happy. They’ve deleted that old Reddit post about our date (or maybe it’s just buried under newer posts), and they don’t post on the platform as much these days. We’ve built something solid, and I’ve never felt closer to anyone.

But there’s one thing they don’t know. Until now.

This post is the first time they’ll learn that I found them on Reddit before ever messaging them on Instagram. I never intended to keep it a secret; I just didn’t know how to bring it up without sounding creepy. But now, after everything we’ve shared, I hope they’ll understand.

If you’re reading this: Yes, I knew about you before we met. Yes, I sleuthed my way to your Instagram. And yes, I knew about that post. But I also knew—long before that first date—that you were someone worth knowing.

And I was right.

TLDR: I found someone’s Reddit posts, connected the dots to their Instagram, and asked them out. They later gave our date a “meh” review on Reddit, but we kept talking and have now been together for four months. This is the first time they’ll learn I knew them from Reddit all along.",1,1733790407.0,Kenya,0,1.0,False
1haoxec,https://www.reddit.com/r/DragonAgeVeilguard/comments/1haoxec/lucanis_romance_analysis_bc_it_is_driving_me/,Lucanis romance analysis bc it is driving me insane how people are jealous of neve,"First of all this is my understanding of it and i just need to let it out. I legit think this whole love triangle is good 😭😭😭

The nevecanis thing adds a layer of complexity to rookanis romance because lucanis has to choose between “something comfortable (neve)” and “something he is scared of (rook)”

This is not me putting down neve, but rather my interpretation of how lucanis takes their different interactions. Nevecanis flirting is easy, fun and lighthearted which is most of the time just expressing admiration. I think thats something lucanis can handle bc he’s used to people feeling at awe with him. He is a “genius assassin” to put it frankly.

Rookanis flirting is different. We can see lucanis aggressively flirting back the first flirt in the coffee shop, because again it is easy lighthearted flirting. The moment rook’s flirting becomes that of concern, he pulls back. Why? He’s afraid (“when i was afraid to want you”). He probably doesn’t know how to process someone actually caring for him bc all his life he’s known the stick vs a carrot due to caterina’s ways. “Oh shit rook might be serious about me… and i might like rook back too?” Is how i can summarize his behavior. Denial of feelings “take your feelings, file it down. Make it useful” because thats what he was told to do by caterina for all his life. 

We go to neve being in lucanis mind. First of all i think it is weird that people are jealous of neve for this bc 1) she’s talking shit about lucanis to lucanis, 2) lucanis uses her as a way to hurt himself. Why would u guys want rook to be there talking shit about lucanis? “Rook cant be here, rook opens doors” that came off to me as rook is someone that can save him by opening his prison (breaking down his walls). like i said rook not being there meant to me that rook never gave lucanis a chance to be insecure about himself.

“Lucanis feels guilty about neve” again i take u back to my opening point. I think lucanis IS guilty about neve precisely bc he is torn between neve and rook. He might feel guilty he’s entertaining the idea of just going the comfy route with neve rather than the scary route with rook.

Finally, at the end of the day when lucanis comes to term with his feelings, there is no alternative route in dav that at the moment you commit exclusively to lucanis, he turns you down and goes with neve. He chooses rook always all the time, given you don’t let him down first. (Maybe the dev should do this just out of spite lmao. Id pay for that 😂😂😂)

Make sense of that how you will. 

I legit think this nevecanis is one of the few nuanced things in this otherwise simplistic game and you guys want to take it away 😭😭😭

Other notes:
On nevecanis being intimate immediately: 

“no talking. When her hat comes off. Play with wisps.” Is not the same as “the curtain is blue” when it comes to being interpreted literally.

Spite may not even know what sex is. And neve literally has no hat AT ALL in the lighthouse. So how can people come to the conclusion no hat = sex?

My interpretation might be influenced by me being demi so it didnt come off as anything sexual. but If the dialogue is something like “her shirt comes off” then i’d agree it’s fucking sex. But a hat is just a piece of clothing on the head that most people dont even wear 😭😭😭 it’s just a clever way of telling me neve is decompressing with lucanis! 😭😭😭 

Im not saying it being interpreted as something sexual is not valid, it’s just that if you are left at that level WHEN YOU DONT LIKE HOW IT MEANS, then it is a you problem bc there are other ways the text can be valid and youve taken the one you hate as the only true interpretation.

Anyway all i want to say is, if you find yourself engaging in any form of media, get stuck on one meaning when there are multiple ways to interpret the scene or line, and youre not having a good time BC OF HOW YOU UNDERSTAND THEM, it IS a skill issue and not the fault of the writer.

If the author wanted it to be taken as literally as possible they’ll definitely write it that way (the curtains are blue). 

Addt: it is nuanced to me because no one was demonized to uplift the other party. Neve even acknowledges thay rook is good for lucanis, which to me meant she was just really being flirty and a good sport abt their flirting. Lucanis is the first one to have feelings afterall.",1,1733790399.0,DragonAgeVeilguard,15,0.56,False

Let's stop food waste!

**Post has three recipes.**

Each year we do a different theme for a holiday party.

Last year it was Asian Fusion and I never really made Asian food except for basic stir fry or fried rice.

I discovered it was super easy and even the ones that required specialty ingredients could easily be swapped out.

A lot of them are also super easy to convert to low carbohydrate or sugar-free.

With ginger powder, don't get the store stuff in the shaker, you can get a 1 lb bag of organic ginger powder. Keep the bag sealed and it will retain its flavor.

**Sweet And Sour Sauce**

It is simple to whip up and doesn't require any odd ingredients for a simple sweet and sour sauce that can be used as a dipping sauce or even as a glaze.

I modified the recipe using an allulose / stevia blend.

Do not use erythritol, it will crystallize.

I used unsweetened curry ketchup, I've also made this with unsweetened Primal Kitchen Ketchup.

Since I used unsweetened ketchup I added a little bit more sweetener than the recipe calls for. 

I mix 1 tsp stevia with 1 cup of allulose as my blend.

**Ingredients**

* 3/4+ cup sugar substitute blend
* 2/3 cup water
* 1/3 cup white vinegar 
* 1/4 cup soy sauce
* 1+ tsp xanthan gum or guar gum
* 1 tbsp ketchup

**Preparation**

1. Take your 3/4 cup sweetener and grind it to a confectioner blend in a coffee grinder or smoothie blender. 

2. Add all ingredients to a pot except the thickener. 

3. Stir together. 

4. Taste and add any additional sweetener.

5. Slowly whisk in xanthan gum 

6. Bring to a slow boil and stir constantly until it starts to thicken. 

7. If not thick enough, slowly sprinkle and whisk additional xanthan gum. 

That's it.

**Notes**

Does not work with gelatin 

You can use rice vinegar but it will make it a little bit sweeter tasting.

It will thicken further as it cools.

Stores for roughly a week in the fridge.

If you want a little bit more kick, you can sprinkle in some ginger powder.

Can add 1 tsp of molasses.

Can add more ketchup If it is too weak.

Can use sweetened ketchup like Heinz Sugar Free Ketchup, just add the recipe amount.

**Egg Drop Soup**

This is a simple recipe that took just a little tinkering.

It does not have any hard to source ingredients.

If you want to make your own garlic salt:

3 parts garlic powder to 1 part salt, I make mine with Himalayan pink salt.

**Ingredients**

* 32 oz chicken broth or chicken bone broth 
* 3 large eggs
* 1/2 to 1 tsp xanthan or guar gum
* 1 tsp ground ginger
* 1/4 tsp garlic salt
* 1/8 to 1/4 tsp black pepper (I use 1/4 tsp) 
* 3 green onions (thin sliced)

**Preparation**

1. Whisk eggs and set aside

2. In a pot, add chicken broth and slowly whisk in xanthan gum. 

3. Add ground ginger, garlic salt, black pepper.

4. If too thin, slowly whisk in more xanthan gum.

5. Bring to a boil while stirring and add green onions and continue stirring.

6. Bring to a roaring boil.

7. Use a non slotted spoon, stir the soup in clockwise or counterclockwise circles, do not change the stirring direction.

8. While stirring in circles, slowly add the eggs. The eggs will cook while you are stirring.

9. Turn off the heat and enjoy, don't overcook the eggs.

**Notes**

Can add additional vegetables or protein, after step 2, add your ingredients and let it simmer until the vegetables or protein get to desired tenderness.

Top with additional green onion.

I like to add a little bit of fresh ginger slivers into the soup when I add the green onion.

**Hot And Sour Soup**

This is another simple soup that I like to make when I have leftover vegetables or leftover meat and I want to avoid food waste.

Because I throw in leftover vegetables it's not traditional. 

I will include a traditional recipe and then you can add or subtract whatever to your taste.

**Ingredients:**

* 64 oz chicken or vegetable broth (or bone broth)
* 8 oz shiitake mushrooms thinly sliced
* 8 oz can bamboo shoots (drained) 
* 1/4+ cup rice wine vinegar 
* 1/4 cup low sodium soy sauce 
* 2+ tsp ground ginger 
* 1+ tsp chilli garlic sauce
* 1+ tsp xanthan or guar gum 
* 2 large eggs (whisked) 
* 8 oz firm tofu cut into 1/2 inch cubes
* 1 tsp toasted sesame oil 
* Salt and pepper to taste

**Ingredient substitution**

* Can use baby bella mushrooms for shiitake mushrooms.
* Can use white vinegar for rice vinegar but it will make it a little more sour. 
* Can use regular soy sauce but will make it more saltier.
* Can use Sriracha sauce or red pepper flakes and minced garlic instead of chili garlic sauce 
* Can use extra firm tofu 
* Can substitute avocado oil or peanut oil for toasted sesame oil
* Can add a little tahini or a bagel seasoning with the avocado or peanut oil.

**Preparation:**

1. In a large stock pot, sprinkle in and whisk xanthan gum with 64 oz broth.

2. Add mushrooms, bamboo shoots, rice wine vinegar, soy sauce, ginger and chili garlic sauce.

3. Heat over medium high heat while stirring until it reaches a simmer. 

4. If too thin, sprinkle and whisk more xanthan gum. Stir soup in a circular motion.

5. Continue stirring the soup in a circular motion, then drizzle in the eggs in a thin stream (while still stirring the soup) to create egg ribbons.

6. Stir in the tofu, sesame oil and half of the green onions.

7. Add additional salt and pepper for taste. 

8. If you’d like a more “sour” soup, add in another tablespoon or two of rice wine vinegar as well.

9.  If you like a spicier soup, add in more chili garlic sauce.

10. Garnish with additional green onions and serve immediately. 

Can eat as is or serve on cauliflower rice or zucchini noodles.

**Notes:**

What I added to the soup in the picture: 

* Was out of bamboo shoots so it was omitted. 
* Used regular white mushrooms. 
* Since I'm sick, I wanted it very spicy. I used red pepper flakes, cayenne powder and jarred minced garlic in water (drained).
* Used 2 tbsp ginger powder.
* I used dark soy sauce.
* Used 1 tsp avocado oil + 1 tsp bagel seasoning.
* Used fresh vegetables that I had in the fridge. 
* Used leftover chicken breast.

Served on cauliflower rice.

**How to add fresh vegetables**

After I added the 64 oz of chicken stock and whisked in the xanthan gum, I added my fresh vegetables

I let it simmer for an hour until the vegetables were al dente.

After that I continued with step 2.",3,1733790309.0,ketorecipes,1,1.0,False

My grandfather, his wife, one of my aunts, and one of my uncles live in the Atlanta area. I will call them T, S, A, and K. T cares about me, i think, or rather he at least sounds sincere when we speak on the phone. his health isnt good, exposure to agent orange during his time serving in Vietnam ravaged his body and has left him rather infirm. S is physically capable, but has severe vision issues, A is a nurse, and K is an executive in a tech firm and has been for my entire life. K has a sister, U, she lives in Arizona if memory serves. A used to live in New York, not far from my Paternal Grandmother P and formerly my late Great Grandmother W alongside her ex husband and their two daughters H and V. S also has stated in the past to not wanting anything to do with P or anyone related to her.

My parents finalized their divorce in 1997, but my mother filed for divorce in 1995 due to my fathers habitual domestic abuse and spousal sexual assault. (Mom gave permission for me to state this, I asked her as I wrote this.)  I dont remember a time where any woman on my fathers side of the family has ever treated me well and meant to do so, excepting W who i met in august 1997 shortly before my parents finalized their divorce. P has spent my entire life demeaning and belittling me. I have never been good enough for her, and she has made that clear. The last time I recieved a gift from A was christmas 1997. I recieved a coffee mug... I was 4, a coffee mug wasnt remotely on my list of presents. P at least bought me legos that year. The last present I recieved from P was Christmas of 1998. It was a joint present for my brother and I, a $99.96 talking battleship game from walmart, on rollback, with the little round yellow rollback sticker still on it. My cousins H and V were gifted a stake in a timeshared horsefarm. I've been told it was for $100,000 at the time, but that could be wrong. They say that how much someone spends on you doesnt show how much they love you, but there are times when its obvious by the discrepency that you arent remotely as valued or loved. 

My maternal Grandfather and Grandmother B and J, as well as my Uncle and Aunt R and E all lived in Vermont. my other Maternal Uncle D lived in Florida for most of my life. B had 8 siblings (4 sisters and 4 brothers) spread across the United states. Most in New Hampsire, but a few in other states as well. J had one stepsister X who was also her best friend during childhood.

I have never met K or U. They have never made any attempt at contact more than a generic christmas card and a picture of each of their children when they were born. I have expressed my desire to meet them for more than 20 years, but i have never been financially stable enough to make a trip to Georgia or Arizona to visit them on a whim. Since I was a young child vacations were a mythical thing that only the wealthy could afford. Biennial weekend trips to the coast of Maine and the occaisional trip to our family owned camp at a small pond were the closest to a vacation i ever had. 

J died in 2001 of breast cancer. It broke me, I was 7 and not remotely prepare to lose one of the few women in my life to cared about me. W died in her sleep in 2021. From 1997 to the time of her death I was not permitted to contact her by P and A. When my brother and I tried to reach out in 2017 we were told by A ""I cant give that phone number out to people I dont trust""

B's siblings have never done more than hug me at reunions and greet me in passing. X loved me dearly, even moreso after the passing of J as I was considered by most of my maternal family as J's favorite grandchild. X has been suffering from dementia for the last 7 years. 

After the birth of her first child R monopolized B's time at every moment she could and ran over anyone attempting to do anything with him by scheduling events for them to do at the same time and dates. B went from visiting me several times a year and taking me to the family camp to visiting me on holidays as he drove back from R's and dropped off whole frozen chickens and me only seeing him at the family camp once a yearfor the annual 4th of july celebration.

This past summer B passed in his sleep, I asked my surviving grandfather T if I could spend christmas with him, as I have enough money and the time off from work and wanted to spend a week with him in atlanta and meet my uncle K. He readily agreed and offered up a room in his house. he has owned the same three story house since the 70's. I arranged and paid for a flight down there and was ready to fly out in a couple weeks. Last night I recieved a call from U, she made it clear that she didnt believe that it was a good idea for me to fly down and spend the Christmas with my only surviving grandparent (I stopped considering P to be a grandparent in 2010 when she told me that she expected me to be the grandchild to drop out of high school and not my older brother.) Today I called T and got S instead, she reiterated the exact argument U made and claimed that both her and T had asked U to make the call. 

So, yeah... thats it... thats the women in my family... to my fathers side im unwanted baggage and to my mothers i just exist... im good for physical labor and not much else.

Sorry if it rambled on... im just trying to process my emotions and come to terms with the likelyhood that i will never have any relationship with anyone on my paternal side unless its through a phone screen.",1,1733790183.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

(I’ve been doing HVAC for roughly 1 year this month) and I work for a super small company where it’s just the owner and one other guy who’s going for his second year schooling next month but is a ticketed gas fitter.

I’m currently able to do my own single zone and two zone installs and ducted installs like the back of my hand along with maintenances on ducted and mini split units.

Im currently making $22/hr and where I live the average living wage is $25-$28/hr… as of the past 3 months the guy I work with (who makes 3x more than me due to being a ticketed gas fitter) has been slacking and doing nothing as far as what he should be doing…

For example, today we’re doing a 4 zone mini split install and I’ve done far more work than he did. I taped and pulled a 94 ft lineset and 87 ft lineset through the attic, strapped it and made it all neat, levelled the heat pump pad as well as did flares on two of the units and wired the two units in. What he did today was cut slim duct….. and helped me pull the linesets from outside while I was in the attic….

It’s been going on like this for awhile now where I’ll either be the one in the crawl space all day for ducted units wiring it all and doing all the bends and flares inside (I have absolutely no problem being in crawlspaces and attics) as that’s my job… 

The issue im having is, is this normal as an apprentice to do considerably more work than the “journeyman” I know me being the apprentice I get the “shit work” but it seems like I do a lot more than I should be with the pay I’m getting… especially when it comes to maintenance days where I do absolutely everything and he just sits there and drinks his coffee and watches me…

Would I be in a good position to ask my boss for a raise due to the amount of work I do and how hard I work? I understand that schooling is a big thing when it comes to getting raises but at the moment I can’t even afford to go to school let alone change my lunch from tuna sandwiches since that’s all I can afford lmfao…

1haorb8,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1haorb8/my_brother_runs_a_podcast_its_starting_to_get/,My brother runs a podcast. It's starting to get creepy ,"       My brother Jedidiah started a podcast three years ago with his best friend Hanson. They called it ""freakcast"", and they'd read creepy stories from the internet. Lazy naming convention aside, the podcast was pretty good. They had a large following (not larger than the hawk tuah girl) and people seemed to enjoy the commentary that was added through the episodes. That was until Hanson died after getting in a car crash, being stabbed, and suffering three consecutive heart attacks. Everyone mourned in their own ways. His family held an open casket in their backyard before burying Hanson next to his beloved dog that had been shot by his grandpa. I bring this all up because after Hanson's death, Jedidiah had been acting very strange.


       It was a cold autumn day when I got the message that sparked it all. At 3:59, Jedidiah's wife sent me a message along the lines of ""Jedidiah has been acting strange lately. Could you come check on him?"". It made sense to me. Me and Jedidiah have always been close, and I went through training to be a psychiatrist so it would make sense to ask me to check on someone's mental well being. I packed my things, hopped in my car, and drove down to their place. Little did I know this would be the biggest mistake of my life. I'll transcribe what happened in this post.




                               **Day 1**   

       I drove for hours and hours but finally arrived. Jedidiah lived in our old family house. mmom and dad moved out when me and Jedidiah turned 18, but I guess he couldn't let go of the old place. Jedidiah's wife, Kate was waiting at the door for me. She seemed to be attempting to hide her concern, but she never was good at covering her emotions.


       Kate let me in and we got to talking. ""He's been locking himself in his office a lot. I listen and he doesn't seem to be working, just.... muttering."" She said. That was the first odd thing I noticed. Jedidiah wasn't usually the type to talk to himself, but I digress. As she continued it all just kept getting weirder and weirder. She told me how he's started to become essentially a hermit, staying in his office unless absolutely necessary. I got all the info I needed, and decided it was time to start my evaluation, or whatever I should call it.


     Kate guided me to Jedidiah's office and knocked on the door. ""Honey, Luke is here to see you"". There was a long pause before I heard the distinct sound of a door unlocking. As I entered it was obvious Jedidiah wasn't doing well. His usually nice, black hair grew greasy and matted. His abnormally large lips had grown dry and chapped. I was debating whether or not this person i was looking at was even my brother.


       As I sat down and began speaking with him, his demeanor wasn't anything like how Kate described it. He was happy, spoke very clearly, and was full of energy. It was nothing like the sheltered, neurotic man Kate claimed he had become. I began asking basic questions. ""Are you feeling well?"" ""Have you been feeling depressed at all?"" Basic questions like that. He seemed completely fine, so I thought the case was closed. That was when he asked something that I should've never agreed to.


       ""Hey wanna see the new podcast episode?"". It was strange seeing as I thought he'd have quit ever since Hanson died. Nevertheless I agreed, and he booted up his computer to show me the video. It seemed to start out fine, the intro playing as per usual, but it got strange from there. 


     Jedidiah sat in the usual setup, and seemed to be talking to someone. The one problem was that no one responded. ""Who are you talking to?"" I asked him. ""What do you mean? I'm talking to Hanson."" He replied as if he were a child, naive to what was going on around him. ""That's not funny man."" I said. Hanson was a good friend of mine, so i was upset at such a disrespectful joke. ""What do you mean?"" Jedidiah asked, a look of confusion plastered on his face. ""Hanson's dead and you think it's funny to joke about talking to him."" I responded to him, trying to control my temper. His demeanor completely changed, the look of confusion changed to that of anger. ""Get out."" He said, anger dripping off his every word. ""Jedidiah wa-"" I tried to say but was cut off by a sudden outburst. ""I said get out!"" Jedidiah yelled, his voice now filled with rage. Not wanting to cause more problems, I left the office and shut the door, followed by him locking it.


       That was about it for day 1. Kate let me stay the night, not wanting me to go through the hastle of driving back and forth. I don't skip on the opportunity to save gas money. The house is way more easy than I remembered. I could've sworn i heard whispering, but I chalked it up to my nerves getting the better of me, or Jedidiah's rambling I'd heard so much about.




                               **Day 2**

       Day 2 started off pretty well. Kate made me eggs and coffee. I scarfed down those eggs like they were my last meal. Jedidiah always told me about Kate's culinary skills, and he wasn't lying. Although I just had to ask one thing.


       ""Why didn't you tell me about the Hanson thing."" I asked. The question seemed to fill her with dread, a scowl spreading across her face. ""I thought you would react poorly."" She said, her voice slightly shakey. ""So you left out that crucial detail?"" I replied, I admit I was getting a bit heated. I couldn't get a response because I was interrupted by a loud laugh coming directly from Jedidiah's office.


       I walked to the door, wondering what it was that made him laugh so hard. Luckily he had the door unlocked, so I entered to see him at his desk, recording something. ""What are you doing?"" I asked. ""What do you mean? I'm recording."" He said, the same childish naivety. ""What had you laughing?"". ""Oh Hanson made a joke."" He responded. I tried to hold my tongue, but i couldn't justify his delusions. 


       ""Jedidiah, Hanson is gone. You're in an empty discord call"". This seemed to confuse him. He checked the call he was in, and to no surprise, he was alone. This seemed to break him. His emotionless eyes filled with tears, his weirdly large lip quivering. He then completely broke down. Not wanting to make anything worse, I left the room and called it quits for the day after three hours of cries coming from the office.


       As I tried to fall asleep that night, the whispering became louder, sounding like it was coming from the walls. I was finally able to fall asleep, but when I woke I found I was in the yard.




                                **day 3**

       I woke up with the feeling of grass covering me. I rubbed my eyes and sat up finding myself in the yard. Next to me was a small piece of paper, I read the message scrawled on which said ""don't come back in here"". The part that horrified me was that the note was written in Hanson's handwriting. I tried to cover my thoughts of supernatural events under a veil of reason. Jedidiah already is taking this too far, it's not out of reason for him to learn Hanson's handwriting.


       I entered the house to see Kate sitting on the couch, seemingly surprised to see me. ""Why do you look so confused?"" I asked. ""Jedidiah said you left. Something about work."" Kate answered. That was it. I was done with this bullshit and stormed to Jedidiah's office, swinging the door open only to find Jedidiah sprawled on the floor asleep. I called Kate from the other room and told her to help me tie Jedidiah to the upstairs bed. She reluctantly agreed and followed my lead to tie Jedidiah down.


       Jedidiah woke up, squirming around slightly as he realized his situation. ""What's going on?"" He asked, that stupid naivety in his voice that I had grown tired of. I jammed the note in his face. ""What the fuck is wrong with you? You really wanna take this stupid delusion so far that you take me outside and write this?!"" He kept that stupid naive look and replied calmly. ""Hanson wrote that"". ""No he fucking didn't! I'm done with this bullshit!"" I yelled back, seething with rage. ""I'm not lying. Well... he told me to write it."" He replied, stammering as he spoke. ""He's been asking me to do things."" He continued ""record new episodes, keep people away. I know you hear him, in the walls"". 


       That caused my rage to falter slightly. I had been hearing those voices in the walls, but i could never make out a voice. ""When did you hear him last?"" I asked. ""Right now. He's right behind you."" He answered. I looked behind me to see no one. ""What is he telling you to do?"" I continued my questioning. ""He said you're trying to take him away from me, and thay there's only one way to stop you"". ""And that is?"" I questioned. ""He said I have to kill you."" He answered. I felt my heart rate pick up. I couldn't believe the situation I was in. My own brother was having delusions of our dead friend telling him to kill me.


       I immediately left the room to tell Kate to call the police, but after a minute I heard a rope being cut, and a window smashing. Me and Kate rushed to the window, only to see Jedidiah on the ground limping into the woods, leaving a trail of blood.




       I wish this story had a happy ending. I wish the police would find Jedidiah and get him the help he needs. I wish Kate could have her husband back. I wish I could get a good night sleep, but all those are practically pipe dreams. It's been a month since then, and still nothing. Thay was until I received a letter in the mail, all it read was ""See you soon"" in Hanson's handwriting.",1,1733789922.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

Light brown discharge with coffee ground first 3-4 days and mild cramps. Also passed the big clumpy liquid bandages and some heavy dark clumps. Last 2 days after slightly being active again(grocery store, unloading dishwasher, making the bed ect) I randomly get gushes of bright red blood. ALSO THO: I’m on the birth control pill and was due to start my white pills 3 days ago but decided to skip them and start new pack. I saw a slight difference after taking 2 of the pink pills to help get ahead of the period/ post leep bleeding. I thought that helped since today I only have moderate brown blood again… But tonight while making dinner I started with the heavy bright red blood again. 
Has anyone else experienced this? I’ve called after hours twice to the md and they were helpful. They said I could come in today to be checked but I’m a week out and couldn’t ask off more for work/ also I’m still a little traumatized and cant imagine going in and being cranked open again so soon. The nurses and md said this could all be normal especially having my period due right now but usually my period is not super heavy. I know I can go in tomorrow if needed but what will they do? I’m scared. I also hope this is just normal. I guess what I’m asking is did anyone else have this bright red after light activity, and it’s heavy but not soaking a super heavy pad every hour… just filling a medium pad plus panty liner I’ve been adding on top to help with quick changes for cleanliness. About every 1.5-2 hours but only in evening and after activity.

1haoorj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1haoorj/i_hate_that_my_family_cant_wake_up_early/,I hate that my family can't wake up early ,"I (19 F) have a family of four. My dad, mom, and younger brother. 

No one in my family except me is a morning person, and I hate it. And I hate it because it causes them to push everything back last minute or be late to things.

Here are a few experiences in just the last month. 

My family had some friends from out of town staying with us for a long weekend. They had plans to go out for brunch and spend the day together and show them the city. They woke up late and missed their brunch reservation, on top of having to cancel two other events because their schedule was now off by two whole hours. I felt really bad for them because my parents could barely get out bed in the mornings to make breakfast or coffee like good hosts, so I was left to do that for almost the whole weekend.

Another time was when my younger brother had a school event he needed to get to. My parents weren't awake yet, and neither was he. I only remembered because I saw a reminder for the event on my calendar. I immediately woke him up and drove him to his event, and was luckily only a few minutes late. When I told my parents about it, they just said, 'thanks'. Just thanks, nothing else.

And one last time was when we went on a weekend trip and we're staying in a hotel that had strict free breakfast hours between 6-10am, meaning no breakfast was served after that time. I tried waking my brother up, since we were sharing a room, but he said he didn't want any. So I went over to my parents room and knocked on their door, no answer. I knocked a few more times and louder, but still no answer. So I decided to call and text them a few times but still got no answer from them. I decided to screw it and just went by myself. They finally woke up around 11, and noticed that it was past breakfast hours and started asking me why I didn't wake them up. I showed them the proof, and they just told me to try harder next time. 

I'm so fucking done, it's unbelievable. At this rate, I just don't care. They don't even stay up late either, they go to bed at around 10, so I don't know how they can sleep for like 16 hours straight.",2,1733789719.0,Vent,1,0.75,False

(I have a shitty circle saw for occasional use.) I have made side tables, kitchen tables, coffee tables, full wall bookshelves, etc etc. But all of my projects take a good while. I got a thickness planer about a year ago and it changed the game. Recently, I inherited a benchtop bandsaw (needs a new blade still) and a Bosch plunge router (already made a table with it - incredible.)

All that to say, I can true up lines and do all the hand tool work, but am looking to make things faster. Primarily rip cuts, but some joinery maybe? (Idk, between the router and the hand tool skills, I’m largely fine there.)

Not sure which direction to go. I have two hand tool benches and am thinking of converting one to a MFT-style tracksaw bench, using a cbd-printed template to cut the holes perfect, etc. it seems the best fit.

BUT there is so little info online. Will I be throwing $1k down the drain only to wish I had a table saw later?

1haol9p,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1haol9p,"Light Roast & Coarser Grind - Huge Improvement, but Some Questions","Previously, I used a medium roast with a fine grind in my 3-cup moka pot, but the coffee always turned out unpleasant—super bitter with a drying mouthfeel in the aftertaste.

This time, I switched to a light roast and a coarser grind (see attached photos), and the difference is incredible! The coffee is smoother and much more enjoyable. However, I’m curious: is this improvement due to the lighter roast, the coarser grind, or possibly both? Could I get even better results by grinding it a bit finer?

I’m also considering upgrading to a 9-cup moka pot, and I’ve heard that the larger the moka pot, the coarser the grind should be. If that’s true, does it mean my current grind size might be ideal for a 9-cup pot?

One thing I’ve noticed with the coarser grind is that my 3-cup moka pot tends to “over-gurgle” more easily. I have to lower the flame much earlier compared to when I was using the finer grind with the medium roast, just to maintain a steady flow and avoid that aggressive gurgling at the end.

Any tips would be greatly appreciated!


TL;DR: Switched from medium roast + fine grind to light roast + coarser grind in my 3-cup moka pot. Coffee is much better, but I’m wondering if it’s due to the roast, grind size, or both. Considering upgrading to a 9-cup pot—would my current coarser grind be ideal for that? Noticed “over-gurgling” happens faster with the coarser grind. Any advice?

I built an auto-slicer for you on web,"I created a tool that automatically detects onsets in audio files and prepares them for the Make Noise Morphagene module, inspired by Ableton's Simpler auto-slice feature.

[https://ericxgao.github.io/morphaweb-self/](https://ericxgao.github.io/morphaweb-self/)

Based on the excellent [Morphaweb project](https://github.com/knandersen/morphaweb) by Kevin Nørby Andersen

Essentially, put in your favorite songs and loops and make some slices - then you can CV the Organize input to get well-timed chops to playback, which can be amazingly inspiring. This opened my Morphagene a ton for me after I built this, so hoping it does the same for you too.



https://preview.redd.it/iir766axxw5e1.png?width=1137&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8fe4b95cdf3e64bf9cdb88203cbe8519d74f0b3

# Features

* Automatic onset detection based on transients or pitch
* Exports Morphagene-compatible .wav files with embedded slice points
* Handles files up to 2.9 minutes (automatically truncates longer files)

Default onset detection parameters (which I found work well for most content):

* Frame Size: 3072 samples
* Hop Size: 50% of frame size
* Sensitivity: 50%
* ODF Ratio: Default balances between detecting high frequency content and pitch changes. Good for both drums and melodic content.

# Quick Tips

* Too many markers? Use the ""Divide by 2"" option to quickly reduce marker count
* Want evenly spaced markers instead? Use the ""Slice into equal chunks"" option
* Processing large files can temporarily freeze your browser tab - don't worry, just let it complete!
* Want generally more or less markers? Adjust frame size (lower = more slices, higher = fewer) - though be mindful that calculating the onsets will take longer if you have a very low frame size.

# File Naming

The output files must be named according to Morphagene's SD card convention:

* mg1.wav through mg9.wav
* Then mga.wav, mgb.wav, mgc.wav etc.

# Limitations

* Maximum audio length: 2.9 minutes (Morphagene hardware limit)
* Maximum 300 slices per file (Morphagene hardware limit)

Before he started radiation, he had to have a 3 inch abdominal aortic aneurysm operated on (very invasive surgery and he had complications). I know, not from my own experience, but from close friends, that the second half of radiation can be very hard on the body. 

My dad is having bad, painful digestive upset and his doctor recommended a special, limited diet. Add to that, food doesn't taste the same to him. He doesn't even like coffee anymore. My mom does most of the grocery shopping and cooks dinner 70% of the time. He has given her the good guide his doctor gave him and she refuses to read it or try to understand. She even referred to it as stupid. She questions him every night at the dinner table when he can't finish his dinner and blames his digestive upset on eating out (which I know he is careful about).

So, she is stubborn (always has been), and it's just not getting through to her that he feels very different right now. I don't know how it feels, but I can relate to your body, appetite, taste changing after my own battle for life in the ICU from an infectious disease. For months after, I had no will to eat, particularly because everything tasted like Cajun spice. So, I am happy to support and accommodate him however I can.

Does anyone know of any resources I could share with my mom to help her empathize with my dad a bit better? The way she speaks to him and treats him is only adding to his stress and fatigue :(   Any advice for something he or I could say to her or show her?

Any tips on how to improve my day to day so that things are manageable? I have been roaming by myself in the dark for so long...,"I (25F) was diagnosed with GP at 14. I also have Diverticulitis, IBS, PCOS, and Endometriosis. I have tried all of the usual medications (and any laxative I can think of), which had no effect, and the typical diets, which only helped with figuring out what I can't eat or drink. As it is now my options are fairly limited. 

I went from being anorexic-ly skinny, to being obese. I dont know if it's because of another undiagnosed issue or what. I know most people with this disease struggle to have weight... I barely eat since it is so painful and honestly at this point my body has lost its ability to let me know when it is hungry anyway. I struggle to even have 1 actual meal a day. Usually I drink applesauce a couple times a day and have a couple spoonfuls of yogurt... I know I need to try more, but it is so hard to motivate myself to do so.

It's effecting the rest of my health, especially my mental health. I am on the verge of a breaking point with my current ""diet"" that doesn't give me any actual energy, happiness, or real nutrition. All I can think about is how I really should try to do better but how hard it is to do so. How much work I would need to put in to do it, and how there doesn't seem to be much of a point to do so... and then I just go back to bed. This disease, especially with the others I have, is absolutely debilitating most of the time. I am miserable 98% of the time in one way or another, as I'm sure the rest of you can relate.

I need your help to try to figure out a ""healthy"" reasonable diet I can do with my restrictions, and I need some tips on how to try to keep it consistently. I have to state, I can't handle liquidated food. And what I mean by that is food that should not normally be liquefied, like breaded things, pasta, meat, etc. I was a CNA for a few years at a small rural hospital and I helped in the kitchens for our long-term care patients and just can't handle even looking at liquefied food without vomiting. The food and drinks I cannot ingest without consequences are:

Raw or even half cooked fruits and vegetables (must be thoroughly well cooked) and I can't stomach them juiced without it being cooked first either.

eggs, including egg whites, unless throughly broken down (it must be so broken down you don't even fully know they're there. Like an egg wash, or baked into something so there are no chunks)

beans of any kind

anything carbonated

rice (or anything small and loose like quinoa)

nuts of any kind (but stuff like non-chunky peanut butter is fine)

oats (whether they are soaked or not, but I can do cream of wheat and/or malt-o meal)

shredded wheat

seeds (like sunflower, pumpkin, etc.)

broccoli, brussel sprouts, asparagus

tomatoes in any form

citrus of any kind

coffee

spicy foods (I can't even handle the ""mild"" sauce at Taco Bell)

energy drinks

corn

popcorn

fish/ other seafoods 

Red meat is not something I can do often, but once in a great while is okay. Most things high in sodium, carbs, or fiber hurt like hell after I eat them but they are not restricted because of my other conditions nor do they induce vomiting so I can handle them occasionally.

If you can help at all I would greatly appreciate it... I feel like I got swallowed by a black hole with no light at the end of the tunnel. I see no way out, just this constant day by day darkness that keeps turning my entire world more and more grey... 

I have also talked to a few different nutritionists or dietitians in my area and they have all turned me away for lack of experience with my conditions. I just need.... a way to not feel like shit about what I put into my body, to not hate myself for it. I need ways to help improve my day to day life, so that I can maybe enjoy it again. Something that doesn't feel so overwhelming. I have been alone for about 8 years through this and it is too hard now. I figured if anyone could help, it would be the people of this community. 

I hope some of you will be willing to help with suggestions. Thank you so much to everyone that does.

***Tuesday***

Pepper stretched and yawned as her alarm beat out its regular high-pitched noise that went close to mimicking the emergency siren of the Miami lifeguards: one of the few things in the world to wake her up in the mornings. Ironically, the other was her phone, for although she had it set for *‘Favorites Only’,* Dispatch, along with her parents, her partner and her boss, was part of that list.

She preferred the beach siren to that of her boss or her parents, as any of them would mean a disaster had occurred, and she’d have hit the ground running in search of said disaster. If it were Dobson, she’d have to think about waking up.

She reached over and turned it off, only to sense she wasn’t alone in her room. With her hand edging towards her weapon, she glanced at the chair she had in the far corner. The outline sitting there barely registered as her roommate before Sararah launched out of the chair and raced across the room to land with a whomp on the bed beside her.

“Finally! You’re awake!” she squealed, her usual morning enthusiasm hitting nuclear levels for some unfathomable reason. She even went as far as to clasp Pepper’s wrist and give it a shake for emphasis. “I thought you were never going to wake up!”

Pepper twisted her head so her bleary eye could focus the time on her phone (that doubled as an alarm clock to save space on her bedside table for other things, like her gun). Due to her broken sleep, it took several seconds for the numbers to make sense, and when they did, she scowled back at her roommate. “What are you talking about, you crazy demon?! This is the same time I always wake up.”

“Well, it took too pucking long today. Lookie, lookie, lookie!” she waved her right hand in front of Pepper’s face as if she'd just been engaged.

Still in the throes of waking up, Pepper caught the hand, halting it long enough to see the plain ring on her roommate’s ring finger.

It was too early in the morning for games. “Can whatever it is you’re dying to tell me wait until I go to the bathroom? In fact, having a coffee ready while I wake up would be even better.”

Sararah pouted but slid from the bed. “Fine, but as soon as you’re done, come and find me in the kitchen. I have something for you too!” As she took a dancing step towards the door, she vanished, and Pepper let out another deep sigh and stared at the ceiling. Now that she knew about the teleporting thing, it looked like Sararah was done *walking* around the apartment. *Is this the sort of shit Lucas has to put up with at home?* she wondered to herself.

Twenty minutes later, dressed for work, Pepper emerged from the bathroom and headed into the living room.

“Girl, what have I told you about your hair?” Sararah groused, holding out a cup that smelled of pure Heaven.

“Hey, someone wanted me to hurry,” she reminded her, rather than get into the whole, *‘my hair’s fine, leave it alone…’* that ended in Sararah doing it for her while she drank her latte and ate her breakfast toast. Honestly, the way the colours shifted in the layers was gorgeous, but the upkeep on it sucked ass.

“Okay, fine.” Sararah relinquished the latte with extra cream and two sugars, then produced something from behind her back with a magician’s flair, holding the tiny picture in both hands for Pepper to see. “Look!”

The bright blur of blue on the blotting paper covered by a transparent film was a pretty shade, but other than that, she failed to see what the hub-bub was all about.

“Guess what that is?” Sararah asked, her eyes shining as she jiggled it in excitement.

Knowing she could not deduce why it was so special while Sararah waved it like a sporting pennant, Pepper put her coffee down to avoid being bumped by her roommate’s agitated state and took the film from her. “It’s a kid’s flower tattoo,” she stated, still lost as to the relevance.

*“This* … is a permanent tattoo that you’re going to wear from now on.”

Pepper made a dismissive snort and tried to hand it back. “Try again.” She didn’t do tattoos. *Ever.*

Sararah’s excitement was tempered by annoyance for a second, but then she was back to bouncing. “No, I’m super-dooper-uber deadly serious. It’s a veil blocker! You put this on, girl, and the phrase that’s been hanging over your head this whole time stops working on you!”

Pepper’s eye widened and widened again as the reality of what her roommate was saying sank in. “What?” she finally gasped, staring at the flower. *This was the shield Lucas wore to fend off all things divine?*

Sararah’s excitement finally overtook her, and she grabbed Pepper’s hands, dancing her in circles around their tiny kitchen. “I’m a Nascerdios now! I get to stay forever and ever, and you get to be safe as my Plus One!”

Pepper laughed at her enthusiasm, right up until her detective brain kicked in and she processed exactly what Sararah had said. “Wait,” she said, pulling away from her friend. “Go back to the *‘I get to stay’* part and explain to me why that was ever in jeopardy.”

Sararah waved both hands as if she were clearing the room of smoke. “Don’t focus on that bit! It doesn’t matter anymore.”

“The hell it doesn’t. What did you do?”

Apparently realising she wasn’t about to budge without a full accounting, Sararah huffed out in frustration. “Look, can you put the barrier on first, and I’ll explain *everything* after that? It doesn’t work if it’s on this piece of plastic and not your skin.”

Pepper doubted something would happen in the next five minutes to destroy her memory of the divine, but she could understand the stupidity of not taking on the protection as soon as possible. “Fine, how do I put it on?”

Sararah lost a little of her confidence. “Lady Columbine and Sexy Beast said it was like a child’s tattoo. I was never a kid, but it can’t be that hard, can it?”

In other words, Sararah had no idea. Fortunately, Pepper had possessed her share of the temporary images growing up (especially during her time in the junior lifeguard competitions) and knew how to affix them. She stepped around her friend and headed over to the sink, where she grabbed the dish sponge and ran it under the water. “It’s permanent, you said?” she asked, for clarification.

Sararah nodded, watching her every move carefully.

“Okay, nowhere obvious then.” She put both on the draining board, then unbuttoned her jacket and shrugged out of it, followed by her silk blouse. The tattoo was retrieved next, where she peeled the plastic film away from the picture and passed it and the wet sponge to her friend. “Put the picture face down on my left shoulder blade,” she said, turning her back to her friend. “Then press the sponge on top of it. Hold it there for a minute, just to be sure, and then peel the paper away.”

Sararah followed her instructions, and when it was done, she tossed the sponge and the now clear blotting paper into the sink.

“How does it look?” Pepper asked, wishing she had a mirror.

Sararah put a hand in front and another behind her, shifting her palms into a reflective surface angled for her to see.

Instead of looking at the tattoo, Pepper’s narrowed gaze all but skewered her friend. “You and I are going to have a loooong talk about what you’re really capable of, girlfriend,” she said, for this amount of shifting was also a new development.

Which, of course, had Sararah jiggling on the spot and shaking the reflection in the process. “That’s the whole point, Pep! I get to tell you everything! I’m a Nascerdios now!”

“Okay … okay…” Pepper laughed, grabbing hold of the wrist mirror in front of her and trying to see the tattoo for herself. “Stand still so I can see.”

The moment Sararah did, she saw the gorgeous little flower on the top right of her shoulder blade, next to her spine. “And you’re serious? This teeny thing is the god-shield Lucas talked about?”

Again, Sararah nodded. “I don’t know how he qualifies for a ‘Plus One’ status, but who cares?! You’re mine! Lady Columbine said, and no one argues with her! Not even the crown prince of Hell!”

Pepper turned to her friend and hugged her, only to pull away a moment later. “But what if … I mean, if you only get one, what’ll happen if you fall in love…?”

Sararah placed a finger against Pepper’s lips. “I’m a sex demon, gorgeous. Sex for me is nothing more than a food source. I don’t know if what I feel for you is love since I’ve never felt it before, but you’re special to me, and I can’t picture anybody else meaning more to me than you.”

Pepper was torn. She did love her friend *as* a friend, but she definitely didn’t swing that way beyond that. And it must have shown on her face, for Sararah smiled and kissed the tip of her nose. “I know it’s not the same for you, silly. I know your beau is probably out there somewhere, pining over your absence in his life. I’m just saying how it is with me. Even if you do move out to go and live your life with Doofus-Maximus, we’ll always be best friends, and I need you as my confidante.”

Pepper still wasn’t completely convinced of that, but there was something else she wanted clarification on. “And if I do get a significant other, he’ll have the phrase hanging over his head if I let anything slip, right?”

“But you can use it now too, even if you make the slip, and he’ll never know.” As if realising that wasn’t what she meant, worry crept into Sararah’s eyes. “Is that okay?”

Pepper hugged her again. “I’m a detective, you idiot. My entire job consists of things I can’t tell people, and I only *wish* I had a phrase that would erase some of the stupid things my partner says on the job! Look at how much I don’t tell *you* about work? And I still have Lucas to bounce things off from a human perspective.”

Sararah huffed and returned her hug. “Ram, girl. Scare the spit out of me, why don’t you?”

Pepper stiffened and pulled away just enough to look at her face. “What did you just say?”

I’m scared of ending it as I have no support system and suffer from loneliness, otherwise. What should I do?","My girlfriend (X) and I have had a tumultuous 3-year relationship with multiple breakups. During a rough patch, my close friend Z (26F), who was originally closer to X, got into an accident while trying to help us (she tore her ACL and now has a permanent limp). After that, Z and I became closer while X and Z drifted apart, especially after one of our breakups when Z chose to stay friends with me but not X.

To add context, X was incredibly kind and helpful to Z after her accident—she scratched Z’s bandaged leg, brought her coffee, and supported her during her recovery. However, since Z distanced herself from X after our breakup, X now feels disrespected and used. Z has made efforts to include X in plans since then, but their relationship hasn’t repaired, and X feels hurt that Z never reached out to reconcile or apologize.

Z has been a consistent support for me, and we’ve never had romantic feelings. I hang out with her and her boyfriend often, and I always invite X to join, but she declines. I don’t hide my hangouts with Z, but I also avoid mentioning them unless X asks, as it upsets her.

Recently, X demanded I end my friendship with Z, claiming I emotionally cheated by sharing relationship updates (like breakups or reconciliations) with her. Meanwhile, Z has been dealing with her own struggles, like her brother’s recent death, so I’ve avoided asking her to apologize to X to avoid adding to her stress.

Last night, X accused me of disrespecting her, hit herself, and insisted I cut Z off. I care deeply about X, but I also have no strong emotional support system outside of Z. I’ve struggled with loneliness and have even been on the verge of relying on edibles to cope. Losing a consistent, supportive friendship like the one I have with Z feels overwhelming, especially given the ups and downs in my relationship with X.

TL;DR: My girlfriend (29F) feels disrespected and used by my close female friend (26F) after helping her during a tough time. She now wants me (29M) to cut off my friendship with Z, claiming emotional cheating and unresolved tension between them. I’m torn—my girlfriend is hurt, but I rely on my friendship with Z for emotional support. How do I navigate this?",2,1733788861.0,RelationshipIndia,2,1.0,False

I (23M) was seeing this guy (35M), and we’ve only had two “dates,” which were just sitting in his car, kissing, and making out. We were supposed to have a proper date to see Christmas lights, but it never happened because he kept complaining about being short on money.

During our last hangout, he stopped at a gas station, and I offered to help with some gas money. Instead, he filled up his whole tank with $25 of my money. What made it worse is that I was planning to use that $25 for the Christmas lights, which were $30. On top of that, I’ve been paying for fast food and coffee during our meetups, while the only thing he’s ever paid for was lunch once.

He always talks about wanting kids, how he’d work two jobs to provide for them, and says “I love you” constantly, but he can’t even afford to take me on a proper date. When I told him I was disappointed and needed space, he apologized, said he was short on money, and promised it wouldn’t always be this way. Then he kept texting me like nothing had changed.

Now he’s trying to make me feel like I don’t know how to deal with “sensitive men,” for being vulnerable but I feel like he’s all talk and no action. AITA for cutting him off when he clearly wasn’t contributing or putting in effort?


Update I told him that I decided not to talk to him anymore and that he should look for somebody else.
He said that he didn’t know how to respond other than OK .. 
He’s asking me if I want the money back what should I say?  (it’s not that I need the $25. It’s just about the principal. Like I’ve never actually had a man want money from me)

Life’s been a fun mix of work, travel, and journaling (yes, I’m a stationery nerd), but I’m starting to think it’d be even better with someone to share it all with!

 **About Me:**

* Fun-sized at 4’11” but full of personality.
* On the heavier side, but working on it—I’m on a holistic journey and loving the process.
* A Slytherin (because ambition is hot), bookworm, and true crime aficionado.
* Travel junkie who can craft an itinerary better than a tour guide.
* Into cozy movie nights, good food, and conversations that make time fly.
* I have my own career and love what I do—so I’m looking for someone who’s equally driven.

 **Looking For:**

* Someone tall (not a deal breaker, but bonus points if ya cute).
* Career-driven and passionate about what they do.
* A conversationalist who knows how to keep things fun and real.
* Someone who’s also been bitten by the travel bug—because exploring the world is always better with a partner-in-crime.
* Open to exploring serious dating without skipping the “getting-to-know-you” phase.
* Preferably around my age or slightly older.

Here’s a fun twist: I’m also on the lookout for a wedding date. Don’t worry, it’s not my wedding—it’s happening next year, and I’d love to have a charming plus one by my side. Bonus points if you’re nearby, open to exploring Pampanga’s amazing food scene, and can keep up with my off-tangent convos and random musings.

Over that time, she’s brought over her three younger siblings one by one to live with us, because her parents are very toxic/abusive. I agreed to this although I knew it wouldn’t be ideal. They were 16, 17, and 18 at the times they each came to live with us. My girlfriend and them are all in school. 

I graduated college at 20 and have been working for almost 3 years in a stressful office job, making good money. I pay most of the bills (my gf works a couple nights a week) and it’s tough sometimes I’m not going to lie. The siblings weren’t raised with the best role models and are often rude to me, although I think they do it without thinking. I do not like the city where I live and the only reason why I am still here is my girlfriend. On top of this I have for a long while believed myself to be some sort of neurodivergent, probably ADHD. Stimulants or depressants of any kind immediately have me feeling more stable and so I’ve been lightly medicating with coffee and alcohol for a few years. I know it’s not the healthiest or safest way to do this but it works fairly well for me. When my girlfriend met me I drank much more, but she got me down to 1-2 days a week pretty easily. My safe place is feeling comfortable in my own home and right now that is difficult, considering I don’t want to live in this town even. At my age I want to start experiencing other places with my girlfriend and start working up, FOMO is eating me alive. 

Recently my girlfriend has told me she doesn’t want me drinking at all, and when I asked her why she said it’s because she feels scared and alone when I do drink, because it feels like a different me. This was a surprise to me because I’m not sure how I could be scaring her, I’ve never raised a hand against her (she’s hit me before though) and given her no indication that I would. She also has no bad history with alcohol, her parents never drank. When I drink I love to listen to music, read, play video games, or watch a movie. I am at my most passive when I drink and always invite her to be with me. As for being alone, SHE is the one who brought almost her whole family to the house, people that I don’t particularly care for. I feel like I am entitled to my safe place and a little booze to block out some of the negativity that life in general is filled with. She admits that my relationship with alcohol has gotten better, but last Sunday night, after spending the rest of the weekend taking her on dates and spending time with her, I asked if I could get some beers since I was feeling a little overwhelmed and wanted to relax before work in the morning. She said flat out no and that’s when i started feeling how unfair this was. I told her that I am not the happiest in this situation and she tells me immediately just to leave if I am unhappy. I feel like drinking some nights should be a good middle ground but she does not seem to think so. 

What do you think? Does alcohol really hurt my partner or is she being overly controlling about something that shouldn’t be an issue? ",2,1733788349.0,relationship_advice,8,1.0,False

During the teasers in the trailer and in the current season in game I had a lot of hype about this mysterious character both because he was linked to the Phreak faction (present since the first OW trailers) and because the icon presented at the previous Blizzcon in combination with the imagery of glitched graffiti created in my mind a unique visual impact compared to the rest of the Overwatch 2 roster.

https://preview.redd.it/snf51j2ltw5e1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=4dc7be14dc7c61267a2dad1f5370fe721acf3fa3

But everything changed (for the worse) with Hazard's official announcement.  
Hazard from a gameplay standpoint has nothing to envy of the latest heroes added to OW as his kit easily makes him one of the most fun heroes to play in the entire game; his design, however, is a whole other story.

https://preview.redd.it/nobqs92ttw5e1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f41d6fd924155549ccb3159e2e6c17dfd467d58

At first glance, it immediately stands out that he almost seems like a secondary character of the brand's C-series (like the members of Los Muertos in the cinematic trailer of Soldier 76) and not the new hero added to the roster, but looking at him carefully, things only get worse...  
To better understand what I mean, let's start by analyzing two old heroes, Hanzo from OW1 and Sojurn from OW2.

https://preview.redd.it/r97wobmutw5e1.png?width=1019&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff4bb6fa0f223a5787c8e5176131c39fb940c7e0

Hanzo has some fundamental rules in the construction of his design that are visible in every hero of the game:

**1)** He has 2 main colors and a tertiary one that give him a unique visual identity within the roster (Black, blue and yellow).

**2)** He has one or more elements that refer to his skill kit (bow and quiver for the primary fire and his abilities and the dragon tattoo that represents his ultimate).

**3)** He also has other small details that reinforce the concept of the character itself and his archetype (Hanzo's archetype is the samurai and thanks to his clothes, the patterns on them, his ponytail and the hilt of his bow, even just at first glance you already know what character he is).  
**4)** An extremely recognizable silhouette thanks to the proportions of each element of the hero.

These four points are present in every other hero of both OW1 and those added in OW2, except for Hazard; let's see what these 4 points are for Sojurn and what they want to tell us:

https://preview.redd.it/xn83i7mwtw5e1.png?width=1051&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a61e070ac1674a5adfe478f6a1407908ad47bf9

**1)** Brown for her skin, white and red for her clothing.

**2)** Railgun and bionic body parts (more focus on her legs).

**3)** Military patch, wiring, cyberware on her face.

**4)** A good silhouette?✅

What does all this tell us about Sojourn?

Just from her design it is easy to understand that she is a soldier of high importance for her country and that she tries in every way to improve her performance both with the cybernetic implants visible in her concept art, and with coffee to always be awake as seen in her characterization in her cinematic trailer.

What can we read about his gameplay style from his design instead?

Given the visual weight of her weapon, Sojourn will necessarily be a DPS that will have a gameplay style similar to more classic shooters (given its soldier-like elements) with some twists in her movement abilities (given her implants and the visual weight of her legs).

Every hero in the game, up until Hazard, has always had these 4 distinct points, very different from the rest of the roster in order to make each new entry in the brand unique and iconic.

Let's go back to the 42nd hero of OW2 **in his final form as he will be in game**, how does he behave in front of these points?  
**(Spoiler, bad)**

https://preview.redd.it/eau9054ytw5e1.png?width=855&format=png&auto=webp&s=941816ee4c74f1ebcecfca9ee72f43f5b63b4a6d

**1)** Purple of two different shades (one for the cybernetic implants and the other for the crystals on the back) and yellow.

**2)** The spikes on the back, the bionic legs (even if not well highlighted) and his rifle(?)

**3)** A dog as a belt(?), some pins(?)

**4)** A good silhouette?🫤

Let's analyze why these points are very weak and why they clash with the visual identity of what has already been told in the Overwatch brand universe.

**Point number 1.**

Purple in visual language is used to represent **corruption** and this can also be seen within the OW roster in characters like Moira (cellular corruption) or Sombra (she is a hacker so a data corruption).

https://preview.redd.it/bk29qp53uw5e1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=8793fca200e0f90754773e8e236941ccf5dfabf4

It therefore makes sense that this color was used to highlight the character's spikes since Hazard has been corrupted by the strange element present in Oasis.

The problem comes to the fore when purple is used for cybernetic parts, why?

https://preview.redd.it/trbi7fo9uw5e1.png?width=242&format=png&auto=webp&s=433ed63dc5bf9a357c1beb4149e1d4801f100a58

Because the **only** purple cybernetic elements in the OW brand are those related to the Null Sector.

https://preview.redd.it/6ys112kbuw5e1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=d970c0db1256ef18e7aa9dad5c99b1df947f96a0

https://preview.redd.it/p9wuvs3euw5e1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=6bee29b62634a333c2073253ac01272cccebe2b7

This in my opinion is a very serious mistake given the importance of the Null Sector for the entire narrative universe of the game and the enormous narrative weight it has.

Furthermore, given that other already iconic OW characters have purple as their main color and what I will say in point 4, we can safely say that Hazard has a weak visual identity that does not stand out from the rest of the roster...

**Point number 2.**

The spikes on his body are quite highlighted and as for their color I have nothing to say; the problem lies in the other elements.

The bionic legs are an important element for Hazard's skill kit, both for his huge jumps and his ability to climb; but then, why are these not highlighted enough? I swear, I have no idea :C

And the same thing can be said for his weapon since both in terms of design and silhouette it is almost identical to Orisa's weapon, once again guaranteeing Hazard a small dose of uniqueness...

https://preview.redd.it/ngzi0glfuw5e1.png?width=425&format=png&auto=webp&s=180c03203bd7826795c8bcaeb1308b428e45bce7

**Point number 3.**

Unlike all the previous heroes, point number 3 does not unite the character's concept and his archetype with his gameplay, having in the case of Hazard only a narrative value (the dog in his belt represents his love for animals and the pins reinforce his rebellious side but are not at all useful in explaining how the character is played in the game).

https://preview.redd.it/7ewg4dkiuw5e1.png?width=557&format=png&auto=webp&s=551c10bf1a0feed4d62a3e073df22fc7235d55d0

**Point number 4.**

Once again the only functional and recognizable elements, even in the silhouette, are the spikes on his back.

Every other point of the silhouette is bland and not very recognizable, for example, as said before the weapon or even just his body...

https://preview.redd.it/ifrfk2zjuw5e1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=7360c302e4ee9864e5aac38e5d8d6957a61d087b

**Beta version of the character.**

https://preview.redd.it/x0nfnc4luw5e1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=26376b4449eee3b26ea9dcc92f8ef860a85b572c

Do you want to know the **saddest** thing about all this?

Even its beta version was better than its current design; more iconic in terms of silhouette, with unique colors among the OW roster (acid green and lava red), unique weapon and not similar to Orisa's, unique bionic pieces and not similar to those of Null Sector and finally his bionic legs also feature hydraulic springs that highlight his kit.

This version of the character literally eliminates any trace of blandness within the character or any narrative error regarding the Overwatch universe, the problem?

That this design will **PROBABLY** never see the light of day...

Probably since in the past some beta designs have been inserted into the game but only as skins (beta lucio).

**FINAL THOUGHTS.**

This post turned out to be longer than expected to write, but what I have inside and that pushed me to write it is not anger, but sadness.

As a lover of the narrative universe presented by Blizzard and a player since **2017**, it really breaks my heart to see that for the first time a character has been presented that is absolutely forgettable and not very appealing in its design.

Especially with the release of the first real competitor of OW, the next season was supposed to be the swan song of OW and instead, at least for now (apart from the 6v6 test), it seems to be totally passable and nothing sensational...

1hao5ql,https://www.reddit.com/r/DatingStory/comments/1hao5ql/my_unforgettable_dating_experience/,My Unforgettable Dating Experience,"It all started on a rainy Thursday afternoon. I had just wrapped up a busy week at work and decided to swipe through a dating app for the first time in months. I wasn’t expecting much just looking for some light conversation to distract me from my hectic schedule. But then I came across his profile. There was something about his smile that caught my attention. It was warm, genuine, and instantly made me feel at ease.

We exchanged a few messages that day, and to my surprise, our conversation flowed effortlessly. We talked about everything our favorite books, movies, and the random quirks that made us who we were. By the time we’d wrapped up our chat, we’d already planned our first date: a coffee date at a cozy café downtown.

The day of the date, I was nervous nervous in the way you only get when you’re excited and unsure at the same time. I put on my favorite dress, one that made me feel confident, but still casual enough for coffee. When I arrived at the café, he was already there, looking exactly like his pictures tall, with that same warm smile that had caught my eye. We immediately clicked, the kind of click that happens when two people feel like they’ve known each other for years, even if they’ve just met.

We spent hours talking, laughing, and sharing stories about our lives. It felt effortless, like we had been friends forever. I found myself losing track of time, completely immersed in the moment. When we finally left, I felt a sense of excitement I hadn’t felt in a long time. We agreed to meet again soon.

As the weeks passed, our dates became more frequent, and I found myself looking forward to each one. We explored new places, tried new things, and even tackled challenges together. Through it all, there was an undeniable connection that deepened every time we saw each other. The butterflies were always there, but they didn’t feel nervous anymore they felt comforting.

Fast forward to today, and I look back at that first coffee date as the start of something truly special. That day wasn’t just about meeting someone new it was about finding someone who truly got me, someone I could share my life with. Our story isn’t perfect, but it’s ours, and every moment has been unforgettable. Looking back, I can’t help but smile, knowing that sometimes, the best connections happen when you least expect them.",1,1733788233.0,DatingStory,1,1.0,False

1hao2ks,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticSpouses/comments/1hao2ks/am_i_the_narcissist/,Am I the narcissist?,"I’ve been with my wife for 18 years. We’ve been married since 2018 and have two adorable children, a 4-year-old and a 5-year-old. She’s an incredible mother, always patient and caring towards our kids. However, that patience ends.

I’m not sure if I’m the narcissist, but at this point, I feel so disconnected and uncertain about what’s real anymore. I used to be optimistic that my issues were valid, but now it feels like a blur. Perhaps it’s because I feel detached and checked out. Many of my problems seem trivial, and it’s frustrating to get upset about them, only to be thrown for a loop again. Why am I even bringing it up, and why are you letting it bother you?

My wife is a stay-at-home mom, and I’m semi-retired, spending my days at home. However, she doesn’t contribute to household tasks. I should clarify that when I say “never,” I don’t mean the proverbial “never” that’s most of the time. I mean NEVER. Like 0%. She doesn’t grocery shop unless she brings the kids over to her mom’s house and then does it for show for her parents. Bringing home three Trader Joe’s bags isn’t considered grocery shopping, and even then, it’s only done twice a year. She rarely leaves the house unless it’s absolutely necessary because she knows I’ll handle it eventually. She doesn’t run errands, take the kids to school, buy groceries like milk or toilet paper, or replace toilet paper rolls in any of the bathrooms. She simply spends her time playing with the kids. All the “picking up” is done by me which means I don’t get any actual family time just clean up behind her time. 

I’ll see my wife step over garbage on the way to the kitchen and ask why she ignores it. This usually starts a fight. She’ll scream for hours or until I walk away, and even when I do, I hear her relentless comments about me to the kids. She’ll also text her mom and tell her I started a fight, but she’ll leave out any details and make me out to be the bad guy. Since I don’t have any other family, this was especially hurtful, and I’ve asked her to stop doing it over a decade ago. Now, as I reflect on it, I can’t help but wonder why I let it bother me and if I’m being unreasonable. Dishes pile up in the sink for days until either I or the cleaning lady comes to clean them. For instance, she’ll let the kids bring something dumb outside, like an umbrella and my wife will leave it on the lawn. She’ll be outside with them and return empty-handed. The next day and so on, she completely disregards the umbrella. Last summer, during a heat wave, she opened five windows. The first day, I came upstairs and started closing them. I explained to my then 37-year-old wife that she couldn’t leave five windows open in 93° heat with the air conditioner set to 68° for eight or more hours. The next day was the same, and this pattern continued for four days until I got frustrated and told her to “close the fucking windows if you want to run the air conditioning.” This led to her screaming at me for hours in front of the kids, which is her usual behavior. When I walk away, I hear her comments from the basement. This has caused me to resent her. Regardless of what I ask, she’ll scream at me until I walk away or explode, and then she’s instantly the victim. 


I’ve never asked her to be a “perfect stay-at-home wife.” I just expect her to pick up trash when she’s on her way to the kitchen and help me pick up after her and the kids so that it’s not just me doing everything. I’ve asked her to at least tell me if there are fumes in her truck that we both drive, especially with the kids, so that I don’t break down on the highway a few minutes after leaving. If she has enough gas to get home, she absolutely refuses to stop at a gas station, even though she knows I’ll have to drive the kids to school in the morning. We both make our coffee at home, and I buy the pre-made ice coffee mixes we like. When we run out, I go to Target and buy the mix, i make sure she has milk for when she wakes up. Most of the time, I also make her coffee. She has never done this. She has left a few times to get coffee, but she always gets Starbucks drive-through. She never gets me a coffee and I still need to buy coffee for tomorrow. The most frustrating aspect is that she’ll deny any of this which makes me feel lost . I’m absolutely certain that all of this has happened, but she adamantly refuses to acknowledge it. Am I wrong for suggesting that my wife be more mindful and close the dryer door after she uses it, given that she’s never closed it? She’ll open the dryer door, get a pair of socks or something she’s searching for, and then leave the door open. I’m just lost and losing sense of reality. Am I wrong?

As a child, I was always taught that any type of processed food was bad for you, and I couldn't even have it on occasions, since it was never in the house. That lead to me developing an ED.

Eventually, I had to move in with my sister(f33) and her husband(m36) for a few months, as it was difficult for me to find an internship at the countryside, let's call him, Dan. When I started my internship, I had just gotten out of a shitty relationship and a depressive period, so I said enough is enough, and made a real and also realistic change. I started walking a lot and weight training at the gym as that was what I enjoyed. That made me gain a bit of muscle, and also lost like 10kg of fat in the last 9 months. The change might be slow, but I realise that it's much more sustainable than quick fix diets. 

One night I was cooking, and since I didn't have a bunch of energy to cook from scratch, I made some frozen beef gyoza I had in the freezer, I didn't consider this a cheat meal in any way. Dan came up to me while I was cooking, and he just said something along the lines of ""That looks tasty but you shouldn't have this type of food since you are making an attempt to lose weight"". At that moment something in me just flipped, and I simply answered ""No one asked you"". The conversation continued with me trying to explain it's really not as many calories as he thinks, and even if it was, he didn't have to comment on it.

For some context on why I feel cold toward him, Dan owns a few coffee shops, and for a pretty big period of time 4 years ago, I was working there with both of them and some employees. At the beginning everything was fine, except for the time he'd feel immense amount of pressure and snap at my sister, and later on me as well, or even walls etc. To clarify, he did have a lot of reasons to feel stressed, but I don't think that makes snapping at people and using them as a punching bag ok, especially if we weren't even the ones that caused his anger in the first place. One night we were closing the registers, and something came up.  As it's been some time since then, I don't remember the exact reason he snapped and started shouting and hitting furniture, but I do remember his problem is i'd talk back to things he was saying, not in the sense of not doing things I needed to do while working, but just, answering? I started crying, and my sister was also shouting back to defend me, which ended in them being distant for a few days, and me being distant for a few weeks. He eventually did apologise about it, even though he told my sister he thought I was acting immature. Bare in mind he was 32 and I freshly 18 at the time, and to this day I don't remember what I said to trigger him this much.

That and all the other instances, brought me into a pretty bad stage in my life and I started some therapy. The biggest subject in therapy, was how unfair it felt that this guy would use us as a punching bag for his other issues and stress. After that night, I never talked back or answered him when he got angry to avoid conflict altogether, until I suppose, when he didn't want to mind his business. I may have forgiven him for that, but it doesn't mean it didn't leave a scar, and that I don't subconciously think he is more flawed than the avg human being, even if it's not all his fault. This type of thing is only the tip of the iceberg on why I don't like this guy, as when we talked about the instance where he commented on my choice of food a few days later, he said that if anyone else had answered the way I did, he would have snapped and beat them up? Should I feel threatened by that??

I have a stupid question. My kids are now at that age where they can entertain themselves more and more, and that means I occasionally have a bit of time to myself. We're talking 20-30 minutes, till I hear yelling and building bricks flying. And in those times I honestly don't know what to do. The past few years I came home from work, sat down with a coffee for a few minutes and then the kids kept me busy till we finally got them both to sleep. After that, I'd watch TV with my wife or play video games. But now, we have longer periods of time where the kids don't completely occupy us. Sounds nice at first, but honestly... I don't know what to do with that time.

I have a couple of days off from work, relatively unplanned but not unwelcome. Sounds nice, right? But somehow it isn't. I still can't sleep in, because we have to get the kids to school, so that perk is not there. Then we have a few hours to ourselves, and frankly, after having a nice breakfast and watching a show or two, I get to doing chores around the house. Because a) it has to be done and b) I don't know what to do with myself. Then we have to start picking up the kids again. And when they're happy and busy with themselves, I just... keep doing chores. Not because they absolutely need to get done right now, but what else am I gonna do in 20 minutes? My wife seems perfectly happy with her phone in those times. I browse Reddit / YouTube for 10 minutes and get _so mad_ at myself because I have a little time at my hand and waste it doomscrolling.

Fosterer told me he is less than 4-5 years old. First 5 days together were a dream. He was so chirpy and talkative. Always closeby, cuddling, loving, constantly lying down next to my feet while I did my chores. He even would sometimes chill on my shoulder while I do chores. Took him to vet and groomer's, both fell in love with him because he's so chill and trusting. 

Saturday (5 days after I adopted him), he was sleeping next to me while I was playing video games. Had been for an hour. Then, out of nowhere, he leaps up, lands on my lap, freaks out and catapults himself into the coffee table where he hit himself pretty hard. needless to say it scared the shit out of me because it was so unexpected. The next day he did the same thing except I was holding him the same way I had held him a lot of times those past five days. It is a completely seemingly random trigger. I've had cats all my life so I know how to handle them and I know I wasn't hurting him.
Today marks the first week that he was with me. Now, it's like he is terrified of me. He flinches when I touch him. Sleeps all day too. Won't respond to me calling him.

He is spending all day either sleeping or looking out of windows. Seriously he is obsessed with windows (and mirrors). He looks depressed like he wants to escape.

What did I do wrong?   
All I did so far was buy him toys and treats, feed him good food and cuddle and love him.  I play with him too. He was such a cute loverboy. Never even took his claws out once. Or hissed.. even though he barely knew me.

During the teasers in the trailer and in the current season in game I had a lot of hype about this mysterious character both because he was linked to the Phreak faction (present since the first OW trailers) and because the icon presented at the previous Blizzcon in combination with the imagery of glitched graffiti created in my mind a unique visual impact compared to the rest of the Overwatch 2 roster.  
  


https://preview.redd.it/zq4qgowezv5e1.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f455410b23f223d29db95e06b9af88487c7e3d3

But everything changed (for the worse) with Hazard's official announcement.  
Hazard from a gameplay standpoint has nothing to envy of the latest heroes added to OW as his kit easily makes him one of the most fun heroes to play in the entire game; his design, however, is a whole other story.  


https://preview.redd.it/170qj5mo0w5e1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a85654f9b291af16ecc880484ef921990e51e1f

At first glance, it immediately stands out that he almost seems like a secondary character of the brand's C-series (like the members of Los Muertos in the cinematic trailer of Soldier 76) and not the new hero added to the roster, but looking at him carefully, things only get worse...  
To better understand what I mean, let's start by analyzing two old heroes, Hanzo from OW1 and Sojurn from OW2.  


https://preview.redd.it/0ufkodlf2w5e1.png?width=1019&format=png&auto=webp&s=46d17a0c1634c7c679c99886e5ca55216851014c

Hanzo has some fundamental rules in the construction of his design that are visible in every hero of the game:

**1)** He has 2 main colors and a tertiary one that give him a unique visual identity within the roster (Black, blue and yellow).

**2)** He has one or more elements that refer to his skill kit (bow and quiver for the primary fire and his abilities and the dragon tattoo that represents his ultimate).

**3)** He also has other small details that reinforce the concept of the character itself and his archetype (Hanzo's archetype is the samurai and thanks to his clothes, the patterns on them, his ponytail and the hilt of his bow, even just at first glance you already know what character he is).  
**4)** An extremely recognizable silhouette thanks to the proportions of each element of the hero.

  
These four points are present in every other hero of both OW1 and those added in OW2, except for Hazard; let's see what these 4 points are for Sojurn and what they want to tell us:

https://preview.redd.it/fr6s0wah5w5e1.png?width=1051&format=png&auto=webp&s=5143d461012b4408ebe0386820e2e5796c7428cc

**1)** Brown for her skin, white and red for her clothing.

**2)** Railgun and bionic body parts (more focus on her legs).

**3)** Military patch, wiring, cyberware on her face.

**4)** A good silhouette?✅



What does all this tell us about Sojourn?

Just from her design it is easy to understand that she is a soldier of high importance for her country and that she tries in every way to improve her performance both with the cybernetic implants visible in her concept art, and with coffee to always be awake as seen in her characterization in her cinematic trailer.

What can we read about his gameplay style from his design instead?

Given the visual weight of her weapon, Sojourn will necessarily be a DPS that will have a gameplay style similar to more classic shooters (given its soldier-like elements) with some twists in her movement abilities (given her implants and the visual weight of her legs).

Every hero in the game, up until Hazard, has always had these 4 distinct points, very different from the rest of the roster in order to make each new entry in the brand unique and iconic.

  
Let's go back to the 42nd hero of OW2 **in his final form as he will be in game**, how does he behave in front of these points?  
**(Spoiler, bad)**

https://preview.redd.it/20sfososkw5e1.png?width=855&format=png&auto=webp&s=d2a515a314d8a3f7bafe37539377bf2d9c15340f

**1)** Purple of two different shades (one for the cybernetic implants and the other for the crystals on the back) and yellow.

**2)** The spikes on the back, the bionic legs (even if not well highlighted) and his rifle(?)

**3)** A dog as a belt(?), some pins(?)

**4)** A good silhouette?🫤

Let's analyze why these points are very weak and why they clash with the visual identity of what has already been told in the Overwatch brand universe.



**Point number 1.**

Purple in visual language is used to represent **corruption** and this can also be seen within the OW roster in characters like Moira (cellular corruption) or Sombra (she is a hacker so a data corruption).

https://preview.redd.it/mou69zz3gw5e1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=84a2525551db422a4cfa56d2c45ded952289df93

It therefore makes sense that this color was used to highlight the character's spikes since Hazard has been corrupted by the strange element present in Oasis.

https://preview.redd.it/fr6foisngw5e1.png?width=1112&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd960e4c1c5d2a28a1f90cd8da00c4fdbb00040a

The problem comes to the fore when purple is used for cybernetic parts, why?

https://preview.redd.it/y5eoyk3yhw5e1.png?width=242&format=png&auto=webp&s=133ff9c47a848188b04eb07f3e838460fc593d31

Because the **only** purple cybernetic elements in the OW brand are those related to the Null Sector.

https://preview.redd.it/rphqgq7hhw5e1.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=3dac5d912df62d31ec4336aa98125714da16130b

https://preview.redd.it/t4sstqpihw5e1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=662aef16c171784ec91f71f73e77753f16aaff96

https://preview.redd.it/v23eapzrhw5e1.png?width=1596&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6948e93ef9b8b5b21ae94c6b3bad8fc0696c554

This in my opinion is a very serious mistake given the importance of the Null Sector for the entire narrative universe of the game and the enormous narrative weight it has.

Furthermore, given that other already iconic OW characters have purple as their main color and what I will say in point 4, we can safely say that Hazard has a weak visual identity that does not stand out from the rest of the roster...

**Point number 2.**

The spikes on his body are quite highlighted and as for their color I have nothing to say; the problem lies in the other elements.

The bionic legs are an important element for Hazard's skill kit, both for his huge jumps and his ability to climb; but then, why are these not highlighted enough? I swear, I have no idea :C

And the same thing can be said for his weapon since both in terms of design and silhouette it is almost identical to Orisa's weapon, once again guaranteeing Hazard a small dose of uniqueness...  


https://preview.redd.it/zmn6ganwkw5e1.png?width=425&format=png&auto=webp&s=6ca7e78f76cc9f154329b8e7b5907907b6f54ac4

**Point number 3.**

Unlike all the previous heroes, point number 3 does not unite the character's concept and his archetype with his gameplay, having in the case of Hazard only a narrative value (the dog in his belt represents his love for animals and the pins reinforce his rebellious side but are not at all useful in explaining how the character is played in the game).

https://preview.redd.it/51wqobaxmw5e1.png?width=557&format=png&auto=webp&s=7fcb233615327ac4d931932a960e688e193b63dc

**Point number 4.**

Once again the only functional and recognizable elements, even in the silhouette, are the spikes on his back.

Every other point of the silhouette is bland and not very recognizable, for example, as said before the weapon or even just his body...

https://preview.redd.it/g110n5wdnw5e1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=0218ee9ca21b6f8530aee9b3270b4cdb935a93b8





**Beta version of the character.**

https://preview.redd.it/8r64xxbknw5e1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=56f82ceb926f8a4591d012a105ad65ce512f62af

Do you want to know the **saddest** thing about all this?

Even its beta version was better than its current design; more iconic in terms of silhouette, with unique colors among the OW roster (acid green and lava red), unique weapon and not similar to Orisa's, unique bionic pieces and not similar to those of Null Sector and finally his bionic legs also feature hydraulic springs that highlight his kit.

This version of the character literally eliminates any trace of blandness within the character or any narrative error regarding the Overwatch universe, the problem?



That this design will **PROBABLY** never see the light of day...



Probably since in the past some beta designs have been inserted into the game but only as skins (beta lucio).

  
**FINAL THOUGHTS.**

This post turned out to be longer than expected to write, but what I have inside and that pushed me to write it is not anger, but sadness.



As a lover of the narrative universe presented by Blizzard and a player since **2017**, it really breaks my heart to see that for the first time a character has been presented that is absolutely forgettable and not very appealing in its design.

Especially with the release of the first real competitor of OW, the next season was supposed to be the swan song of OW and instead, at least for now (apart from the 6v6 test), it seems to be totally passable and nothing sensational...

Hi, first time posting but I really need some advice! If there are any dads who’s been in the same position please help! 

My daughter’s mum is absolutely insane. I’m sure many co parenting fathers say the same but this girl is something else. 

We have a 4 nearly 5 year old together, me and the ex spilt up over 2 years ago. It’s been 2 years of hurtful lies and abuse from her. She wont let my dad see my daughter through some bs lie she came out with. My ex has accused me of abusing her physically (I’ve never laid a hand on her but she has physical punched me a couple of times during the relationship) and mentally and accused me of cheating (we spilt up as she cheated on me which I found out after she left me). She still with that guy (they’re on and off constantly) and my ex suggested he might beat me up as I was talking to my friends about the spilt when it all happened.
Countless arguments in this time which would make this post 6 paragraphs longs so I’ll leave out a lot 
I have no control in my daughter’s life really, from nurseries to school meals I really don’t have much say. 
Use to have her Thursday to Sunday, Friday to Sunday, Friday to Sunday and every Wednesday, so basically we’ve tried to spilt it equally which equates to me having her at minimum every weekend for 2+ years and more so 

I’ve been with my current partner 1 year and 1/2 and she’s incredible with my daughter and me. She does stuff with her that I wouldn’t even think to I.e crafts and games. She adores her.

Issue being my ex is getting worse abuse wise and just outright cause us stress. They were really good to begin with, met for coffee to discuss our daughter’s routine and things (although my ex spent this time saying how horrible I was). Current gf has help the ex offering support for her mental health issues, we’ve taking my daughter on days which aren’t ours as she was struggling. But now she’s lied about her, and said she has “concerns” about my current gf looking after our daughter and a load of nasty comments 

It’s got to the point where my gf has been in tears. And I don’t know how much longer I can do this. We have a 5 month old together and it’s ok now cause she doesn’t know anything but when she gets older I’m worried this stress will affect her. 
I love my eldest like any other parent loves their child but we are both so mentally drained. It’s every week there’s something new she’s kicking off about. 
Not to blow smoke up our ars*es but we’re good parents. We spend our days messing around making them laugh taking them out and treating them but the stress of my ex is starting to crumble us. As much as we’re good parents I think anybody in the right mind would be struggling here 
Has anyone else been in this position before? Given up their child because they just can’t take the abuse from the ex? 

I can’t fight for full custody, or even go get a custody arrangement order I don’t have the money or means. Besides a custody arrangement wouldn’t change anything.

Like I said there’s so much stuff I could say, so many lies and abuse that we’ve received I just can’t write it all down, but this is the general grasps of what’s happening

It’s at a point where I don’t think we can do this anymore, feel like I’m forced to give up my daughter for a happier future for my family! Am I wrong for feeling like this? ",1,1733786913.0,DadAdvice,1,1.0,False

1hanlk9,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1hanlk9/adhd_and_depression/,ADHD and depression? ,"
I finally want to seek help but also want some insight and others personal experiences to help me better understand.

I am battling what i think is a mix of adhd and depression. I have always struggled a bit with school, work, and relationships due to motivation and focus. I’ve also battled with my fair share of depression which mainly contributes to self confidence issue which inhibs me to perform (examples: shutting down in some social situations from getting in my head and confidence issues). It feels like a lot of it can be self confidence driven. i never think i am doing “enough” and sometimes question my value to others. I want to be able to do well in these situations. I have tried adderall (not prescribed but from a friend during college) before and found it to help resolve some of those symptoms. What i found with adderall is it seems like it really helps me focus to get something done. It keeps me driven but more on a “chemically” driven sense not internal. It can even help in the social settings to help make me feel more confident and talk more. The similar effect can be seen with coffee but at much smaller scale. Due to this i am a heavy caffeine drinker and when i do get myself to go out or hangout  i always try to consume caffeine to give myself more energy.

So i know i have adhd symptoms and can be helped with stimulants. The part that i wonder is if my adhd is depression driven or if my depression is adhd driven. For example, sometimes it can be hard to do things i like to do like hanging out, going out to places and even things like playing video games. I struggle with motivating myself to want to do these things sometimes even though i know i like them and enjoy. I always feel bad when i don’t do these things and say no because i know im missing out and not spending time with the people i care about. Like even on the weekends when i finally get a break from work it’s so hard to get myself to do the things i wanna do. I sleep in all day, barely get anything done, and barely hang out with people i love. At night before bed sometimes i get depressive thought loops. Nothing super serious but i just tend to overthink a lot which is negative. I tend to overthink all the time which leads to negatives. Im not sure if it’s due to a mix of mental and emotional exhaustion but either way it damages my mental even more, my relationships and my overall wellbeing. 

This is something i feel like i have dealt with for a while. I think i can be considered a “sensitive person”. I guess it can be hard to regulate my emotions especially if im upset it’s really hard to even function and focus on other things tbh. Or even if im not necessarily upset and im in a social setting and get confidence issues and shut down it’s hard to come back from that after getting in my head. 

I always thought i needed to be put be put on stimulants like Vyvanse or adderall but wonder if my issues is more depression driven and something like Wellbutrin would be more advantageous in terms of helping me more as a “whole” rather than just being able to focus and get work done while a stimulant is in my system. 

I am going to talk to my doctor about all of this but any input is appreciated.

TLDR: Showing signs of adhd and depression symptoms but not sure what’s more of the underlying problem.

1hankgy,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingadvice/comments/1hankgy/love_note/,Love note,"For some context, I fell for this girl I met on 11/11/24. I actually caught feelings for her on the 12th. We are coworkers up until the 12/12/24 which is this Thursday. Everyday it has been so difficult to get through when she is not there. She has the most beautiful smile that lights up a room. I try to compliment her here and there. I asked her for coffee last week on Thursday and I got a weird response in which she asked after 4pm which is when we get out. To which i replied when ever you are free, then we proceeded to talk about different coffee shops and types of coffee. Usually I would take that as a no, but since she started talking about the coffee shops I don't know how to take that answer, so I plan on asking again this Wednesday the 11th. I have never felt this way about someone, but besides the point I want to give her a parting note/letter that states how i feel and regardless of the outcome she is a special woman. My question is even if she rejects the coffee Wednesday or gives that im busy answer should i give the letter for my closure. Its been very hard to not be able to express whats on my mind. I am not very emotional but meeting her has opened that side of me. Im usually known as heartless by my friends and other coworkers. I am also a comedian in the sense that i can say out of pocket things that usually make people laugh including my boss. for some context on her, we are very similar, we drive the same car, similar ideals as in trying to find someone in person rather than a dating app. she can pick up when im joking. Some people told me that im coming off as desperate, but I dont know as i have never been though emotions like this before. She is away on a business trip and i cant stop thinking about her/missing her. im optimistic, but she is kind of a dry texter. i feel like i should prep for the worse. Any advice is greatly appreciated.

I reached out to reconnect, not thinking she would ever talk to me again and to my surprise, she responded. I was excited, nervous, scared and out-right feeling like I could conquer my world. 

I asked if she wanted to meet up to grab some coffee (nothing crazy, I wanted to have a setting where we could reconnect without any sort of suspicion for bad intent) and she agreed. I planned the time and place then I asked when she was free and she gave the date that she was available. 

  
We spoke over text with small conversations just to have some conversation under our belts for when we meet up. 

  
Everything was going smoothly until my work came up. She asked me what I did and I thought I could evade by giving a ""meaty enough"" answer but that didn't work. She went on and asked where I work, I did my best to casually mention where I work then I naturally directing the conversation to another topic. 

  
She hasn't responded since then and I'm lowkey getting nervous and afraid. 

  
Now the reason I hesitate to bring up my job to her is because there is evidence that suggest that with the industry that I work in, that she might very much be against. Which is what I am afraid of. She could have read that and gone ""oof, dodged a bullet there"" and ghosted me. 

  
I could have lied but that's how I lost her the first time, with lies (from other people, and me not setting the record straight and letting the lie get out of hand) and I don't want to reconnect and start things off with lies. So I was honest and I'm afraid that it cost me. 

  
Sure I could be overthinking this, and being too emotional and irrational, but I really want to be back in each others' lives. I miss her... I miss her a lot dude. ",1,1733786380.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

# The Path to Guilt

**normal people**: i need to study, * grabs coffee* alright let's study.

**ADHD people**: i need to study, * grabs coffee* alright let's study, 30 seconds later, oh what is the etymology of this word?
oh it might help if i watch this 30 minute on it. but first i need music,
oh shit new album just dropped, * forgets they were studying *

problem is we forgot what we should be doing and just go on endless side quests

**your problem is** you can't focus on the problem.

# The Cause

let's say you want to lose fat so you ask:
> ""what is the best way to lose fat?""

you can't change up your diet to accommodate all the latest news reports, you’d run into a lot of contradictions, there is hundreds of valid ways people have lost fat.
there may not be one ""best"" way. you could spend years researching this topic and you would still be fat

learning something new feels like progress but in fact, real progress is you going to the gym.

you don't know when you should stop researching and start implementing.
the worst part is you have a good logical reason: ""what if there is a better way? or a more efficient method"" and you might be right.

- there is a more efficient way.
- there is something you don't know that is helpful to know.

so you keep going deeper...

# The Root Mistake
if you looked at the above scenario what was the root mistake?
keep in mind you can't really change the way you are wired.

it was the question you asked yourself in the beginning
> ""what is the best way to lose fat?""

that question will only lead you to learn about _ways_ to lose fat but what you actually want _is_ **TO LOSE FAT**

^(thankfully this is easy to fix)

# An Alternative path

here is a better question to ask yourself:
> ""what is the ONE thing I can **do** such that by doing it everything else will be easier or unnecessary?""

Employing this question, you won't even need to open Google to figure out you should quit sugary drinks. Once that's done, you can ask the above question again.

no need to read a single article.

1han82y,https://www.reddit.com/r/endometriosis/comments/1han82y/pain_when_stretchingbefore_bm/,Pain when stretching/before bm?,"For some context, I was diagnosed with endo after a laparoscopy when I was 19 after years of my OBGYN putting me on birth control after birth control to manage symptoms. I had excruciating cramps that were debilitating when they’d hit. I wish I had paid more attention back then and asked more questions - she said I “only had a little bit” that she excised, but I’ve searched for the records of the surgery several times over the last 7 years and it’s like they’ve disappeared. The hospital it was done at can’t find them and the practice that my OBGYN was at looks like it shut down, and I have no idea where she went. 

I’m 26 now and there is now and endo specialist about 20-30 minutes from where I live. I did a call with an endo specialist in another state about two years ago and he told me that my present symptoms sound like they could be adenomyosis but that I should consult with the specialist near me if I’m worried. I think I would like to at this point, but honestly my flare ups don’t happen as much as they used to and I think I tend to gaslight myself into thinking it’s not important and I’m just being dramatic. 

I’ve tried googling the symptoms I have but I haven’t been able to find much information, so I figured asking those who also have endo might give me better results. 

I’ve wondered if I have bowel endo because around my period I’ll get very condtipated for a couple of days, and then it goes to the other end of the spectrum and becomes diarrhea. Occasionally I’ll get extremely intense cramps that usually tone down a bit once I’ve finally had a bowel movement. It doesn’t hurt when I go, but I’ve learned to recognize that the worse it hurts the more backed up I usually am (tmi lol). This doesn’t happen every month, but I wasn’t aware of flare ups before today (after lurking through some other posts) and I did have coffee this morning (a known inflammatory/intolerance that I still indulge in) and I just stopped bleeding from my period yesterday. 
Additionally, sometimes when I stretch or sometimes when I am carrying things (they don’t have to be especially heavy, but I think probably around 10-20 lbs is when I start to notice it) it feels like my uterus is being torn in half, like it’s attached to something above or around it and being ripped away. I’ve often wondered if this could be from endo but have never thought to pay attention to if I notice it more around my cycle or not. 

Long post, I’m sorry, but has anyone else experienced similar symptoms? Mainly the pain when stretching or carrying things. I’m trying to convince myself that it’s worth it to go this specialist, but I hate feeling like I’m wasting time and money or being dramatic over nothing.

1han7l6,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1han7l6/the_weirdest_thing_happened_yesterday/,The weirdest thing happened yesterday.,"I've been struggling a little bit in the last month and a half since my ex officially ended our relationship, and about 4 months since the beginning of the end. It's been tough seeing her move on at a faster pace than me, suspecting she's ""dating around"" and/or sleeping with others (this is because she moved away and had literal horseshoes for luck in finding a job and a place to live) while I sit here trying to piece my life back together wondering what my future looks like, losing everything and gaining nothing.

Yesterday morning I went to IKEA to find some more home decor stuff (that's what I've been hyper-fixating on as a distraction) and as I was walking through the isles, I saw a gorgeous brunette about my age walking toward me. We both looked at each other with a strange look like we both knew each other from somewhere. She asked ""Do I know you from somewhere?"" and I said ""I don't know, but I'm wondering the same thing"" and as it turned out we went to the same high school together (she was actually a high school crush) and graduated the same year, 13 years ago. We talked for a little while and she asked if I'd like to go for a coffee to catch up. I said sure, I've got nothing else on the go today. So we went for coffee and the conversation flowed for hours. Old memories, what we've been up to since. We laughed and talked and afterwards we walked around the plaza for a little bit. We exchanged numbers, hugged and carried on with our days.

We're meeting up next week again. I haven't felt this positive in months and I didn't even connect physically with this person. It's literally like someone literally spawned her into my life when I literally needed interaction from someone outside of my circle that \*could\* lead to something great some day. We talked for hours after and I was totally up front about my situation being just out of a 5 year relationship and how I am absolutely not prioritizing another one, not going to rush into anything, but that there was chemistry and I'm beyond okay with taking it slow and seeing where it goes. She agreed, and that she's in the opposite boat, single for 5 years and dealing with some other priorities in life like home & career, just gonna let the chemistry flow and maybe it'll lead to something some day.

1han6gr,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1han6gr/my_entire_home_town_decided_to_threaten_me_and_my/,My entire home town decided to threaten me and my family cause I got covid,"This is my first post here, even thought I’ve had reddit for years. Also, i’m sorry for my spelling, i’m dyslexic. 

So, in 2021, I was in high school in a small town. A bit of background, my family (my parents and I, i’m an only child)moved there 2 years previously (technically 2018 but in late 2018), so i was definitely an outsider in this new, very small high school. we went from the biggest city in the country to a tiny town, allowing my parents to retire. they are older, had me much later in life. 

Anyways, the town does not like outsiders (not many small towns do), but i made friends. Some of them I liked and some of them scared me. in fact, all of them scared me. Back in the city, i was able to walk away and go sit with other friends if there was too much happening, here i sorta had to deal with it face on (good life lesson, hard to deal with at 15) and it was very tiring. i also felt separated from them, they grew up together and here i was out of nowhere. i get it, and the people i still talk too now did not have this mindset but it was hard to find them in the mix. 

back to the main story, in spring of 2021, I tested positive for covid. my high school was doing in person cause it was so small and i car pooled with some friends due to it being much faster then the bus. I was not as careful with covid as i should have been and i was in the wrong, but i think the reaction was too far. I felt sick and decided to stay home from my job at a local coffee shop and school. I told my parents and we all went to get tested. my test was positive. i felt terribly guilty and at this time, in my country, when you tested posted the local health department was notified and they needed you to tell them everyone you had come in contact with in the last 24 hours. i called my friends, and my friends brother told EVERYONE. 

I was on the phone with public health and people just started calling and texted me. these where people i thought where my friends, people i had in my house and fed on the regular when they stayed in my house. i always welcomed them in, no matter what. i look at the texts and it’s nothing but insults, threats and accusations. my friends mom was our principal and even she was being rude. in a group chat created, i said yes, i had covid. people started blaming my family, telling me i was reason their family would die and that i should ‘off myself.’ they threaten to kill my parents. few people said anything helpful.

as a reminder, i was not the first sick. actually, when everyone else was sick and still going out, i stayed home. the major spread started at the church and i was the first person to actually get tested, luckily. the nurses said they where glad i did cause it prevented it from getting much bigger. yet, the messages and phone calls didn’t stop. i eventually deleted socials cause i couldn’t take it. teachers posting on facebook about me, people i looked up too at one point. i think the worst part is how supportive they where of each other, sending food, texting nice messages, i couldn’t believe it. the same people i thought were my friends texting me to kill myself then turning around and being so nice to each other. an example, one guy texted me threatening me about me being sick and then called a girl who i was friends with at the time and made sure she was fine, she was mad at me too but i suppose behind my back is better then the alternative. 

it was heartbreaking. made me realize that im an outsider to be them, no matter how close i thought we were. ah yes, turn on the person you don’t grow up with just cause you can. 

my work even called me in for a meeting and blamed me for them losing 2,500 in revenue because they had to close down for 2 days (i’m calling bullshit). as soon as i was done school that summer, i left for college. haven’t really been back other then to be in my house. 

I don’t trust people anymore. not that i did before, but now im resentful. it’s been 3 years and Im not over it. i’m very successful now, but still thinking of this makes me angry. my father and i don’t talk much due to the fact he also turned on me, said my mom’s death was my fault (she’s alive and well). i understand high tension but i can’t look him the same anymore. 

I’ll probably be angry forever. might be unhealthy but oh well. my parents still live there and even though i don’t feel comfortable there anymore, i don’t want them to move. they have such good friends and have their own community there. so i just stay away because sometimes i could just scream.

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it’s you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength—I wish I’d had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There’s so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it’s not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian—your mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she’s gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I’ve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I’m certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup’s rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn’t know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you’ll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I’m deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea’s trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, “W-what does this mean?”

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. “Not here, not now. Let’s get home, then we can talk.”

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother’s shrill voice called after them, “Leaving already? You haven’t stayed for lunch.”

Sorin’s jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. “I’d rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.” With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. “Damn it, damn it, damn it.”

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea’s gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

“D-do you… think this could really be true?” Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. “Look, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might’ve signed, we’ll have proof.” He paused, deep in thought. “Dad must have something lying around.” A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. “Why did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could’ve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!”

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. “We… we don’t really know what was going on back then…”

A sob erupted from him. “I loved him so much, Drea. I don’t remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end…”

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another’s embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, “Call Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.”

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn’t rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

“That’s it! That woman is going to pay today. I’ve tolerated her long enough!” He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

“Adrian, no!”

So for her birthday this year, I bought a Gaggia machine (plus tamper, wdt, fancy grinder, water filter, cups). Since then, I've been making lattes for her weekend mornings and the occasional evening. Plus, whenever we have guests over I usually offer an espresso based drink!

She's been telling me recently how she's excited to get ""[my name] coffee"" on the weekends, so I'm on cloud9 from that haha.
