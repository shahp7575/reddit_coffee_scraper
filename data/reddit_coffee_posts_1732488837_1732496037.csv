Sex isnt the first thing on my mind i in fact view it as a job. Im not repulsed by it but pretty annoyed by it at times. I also go about sex...not the usual way per say.
This may sound dumb but its a dream of mine to have a nice chat over a drink or something with a guy i find not only physically attractive but mentally stimulating. Even if its just once. Ive tried but guys just flake or like i said ..just want a hook up and then discard me. Whats even more frustrating is that I propose the idea and give them space. I dont insist or scare them off. I try to be self aware. I even propose to go wherever they find convenient and i tell them its on me. Yeah maybe i wont be able to take him to a nice place but its the intention that matters? I wont take him to a place like white castle though unless he wouldnt mind lol.
 Im just so tired i gave up on all the apps ive tried. Even just to find friendship its hard. Whyy?! Seems everyone has their own clique of friends and they see a new guy to the group as a threat? ",0,1732495421.0,askgaybros,1,0.5,False

1gz6a16,https://imgur.com/a/iEpl9Vc,What pesky fly do I have?,"
I have stared at so many pictures and still can’t figure it out for sure. Here is an album of macro phone pics and phone pics through my son’s magnifying glass. It’s a pretty cheap one and I couldn’t adjust it enough to get it all in one shot. 

By visual my guess was fruit fly but only because of the lack of long segmented antennae and reddish brown eyes. 

Behavior: This makes me question fruit fly. They weren’t hanging out by the apples I had on the counter (I did put those in the fridge in case). They don’t care about the apple cider vinegar traps I put out. They mainly hang out on the ceiling, cabinet doors, door frames, and near the coffee maker. I do occasionally see them by the garbage can or near the sink if someone left food on a plate. 

I have mostly been vacuuming them off the ceiling. If I approach slowly, it’s pretty easy but if I get close too fast, they fly off. I’ve been able to swat them with my hand and even sucked one or two out of the air with the vacuum. 

At one point I got down to two in a day and then I got sick and wasn’t getting them and the first day I felt better I counted close to 16. ",1,1732495210.0,whatsthisbug,3,1.0,False

The wind whipped through the air as the sun took the sky by surprise. Amber rolled over as her hand slapped Amber awake. Amber pushed her friend off as she sat up in the van. The light from the sun blinded her through the small opening it pushed itself through in the windshield. Amber pulled her glasses on as she took a swig of her water. Amber climbed into the passenger seat as she started the car turning on the heater. And just like that Amber awoke. Her purplish pink hair fell over her face as she stretched. The van filled with smoke as Amber filtered her herb through water. Amber just scoffed as she leaned back in her seat.

“Don't be such a prude.” Amber coughed up smoke as she got ready for another hit. “It's good for the soul dude.” Amber was not about to taint her lungs with such filth. She just watched her friend in the rearview mirror as smoke filled her lungs. After her wake and bake Amber crawled into the front seat starting the car. As the van hit the road Amber leaned on her hand looking out the window. The dirty street zoomed by as Amber flicked on the blinker. Before a word could be shared between them they pulled into the self storage. The van stopped in front of rows of storage units. The lock was removed as the door raised. The room was small. Hiding inside was a couple boxes of stuff and a rack of clothes standing off to the side. An electric guitar and bass laid against the wall behind the rack. The girls each pulled together an outfit before leaving the unit. 

“I really need a shower,” Amber said, climbing into the passenger seat. Small conversation picked up as they got back on the road. “You gonna call him back?” Amber scoffed at her words as she eyed the road 

“Pft no thanks, he was weird, what about you, hanging with your boy toy today?” Amber nudged Amber making a kissy face. “Come on I’m just messing with you, I like Brian.” Amber liked Brian too a lot. He was nice and kind. And he was always thinking of her first. 

The pair finally got to the gym. Amber pulled her friend close as they tried to ignore the eyes on them. The gym didn’t freeze but some did let their eyes wander. The Ambers took their time under the hot water as they cleaned themselves. Once the showers were done they got smoothies at the bar. 

“Hey why don't we go see that boy of yours?” Amber asked, pushing Amber a bit. Amber's cheeks blushed thinking of Brian. They piled into the car racing across town. Amber couldn't help but feel embarrassed as Amber hung out the driver side window screaming at other drivers. “Nothing but assholes today am I right.” The car finally reached its destination. Another car sat in front of them. A familiar pick up truck sat on the street. Amber slipped out of the van undetected as she crept over to the truck. “Gimme your shit bitch this is a robbery!” Amber's voice rang loud as she popped up by the driver side window.

A silent scream shattered the invisible window over the real window as Doge almost had a panic attack. Her eyes dilated as she froze in fear. Amber couldn't help but feel bad as she attempted to open the door apologizing to her. Amber quickly ran around to the car.

“Doge are you alright?” Amber tried to open the passenger side door but the car was locked up right. During all the commotion another voice called. 

“What's going on here?” Sofia entered the scene with a raised brow. The Ambers quickly tried to explain themselves as Sofia circled the car. She stopped at the driver side window pushing Amber away. Doge was holding herself tight as she tried to control her breathing. Sofia tapped on the window. Doge’s eyes shifted as Sofia's soft voice spoke to her. “Hey, will you unlock the door?’ Doge shakily reached out her hand unlocking the door. Sofia just slowly pulled her door open as she crawled inside the truck. Sofia climbed into her lap as she ran her hands through Doge’s hair. The Ambers could not hear the whispers between them as they watched. 

“What's going on?” Brian's voice shook their attention. Amber and Amber turned. Brian just looked at but confused at the girls in the truck.

“I wanted to see you before class, looks like someone else had the same idea.” Amber shifted looking back at the girls kissing in the driver seat. Brian ran his hand through Amber's hair before he kissed her. While they were sharing an interment moment Amber decided to tap the glass like she was watching fish swim around. Sofia shouted a lot of naughty words through the muffling of the truck. Amber wanted to stand in the open air with Brian's embrace forever but that was impossible. Brian said his goodbyes as he left for class. As Amber tossed her keys in the air catching them Amber cut in front of her. “Can I drive?” 

“Right like I'd let you drive my car, the day I do that is the day I die.” Amber ruffled her friends' hair as disappointment and anger combined on her face. “Ok tell you what, I'll let you drive if you can take me.” Amber backed up as she tossed the keys onto the hood of the van. She pulled her short hair back out of her face as took a wrestling position. Amber wiped the emotions from her face as she took the same position. An tussle to the floor and an armbar later and one Amber had the other in a headlock. “Say uncle! Say it!” Amber struggled to break free. Amber had a good grip that would not loosen. She had no choice.

“Uncle!” She was released as Amber swiped up her keys.

“Looks like I won again, now get in the car.” She did as she was told as Amber started the car. They pulled onto the main road as Amber marked out their next destination. “You're too dainty, you know that.” Amber didn't want to listen; she just gazed out her window. “You can't let people push you around, one day I might not be around to take care of you and you'll need to be strong.” Amber was barely listening as she was thinking of the man she left behind. Amber's potent words soon waded as she flipped off the driver next to her. As Amber's mind trailed off she noticed Amber took her eyes off the road as she tried to grab something behind her seat. Amber quickly grabbed the wheel pulling them back into the center of the road as an argument started between them. 

Ten years later……

“And if I'm everything you want me to be then why'd you leave me in this endless sea, I think this red rose is the key to everything, I've got a snake bite on my left wrist I've got a bone to pick so I suggest you never go away, meet me after summers line.” Brian's soft words came to a stop as he muted the strings on his guitar. Amber ran her hands along the neck of the guitar until her fingers touched Brian's hand. 

“Is that song about me?” Amber tilted her head as she shifted on the bed. Brian just kissed her hand.

“Yeah it was the first thing I wrote.” Brian set down the guitar as they laid back on his bed. The pair held each other softly. 

“I'm sorry I just left you.” Brian silenced her with a kiss. The pair clang to each other as they shared the moment. Amber pulled back a bit, breathing heavy. “My parents want to meet you.” Amber climbed onto of Brian as she stared into his eyes.

“I'd be glad to meet them.” Brian's words slipped off his tongue as it entered Amber's mouth. Amber dragged her body up his.

“Good because they have invited us to dinner tonight.” Their eyes locked as a knock hit the door. Liam knocked on the door. There was silence as he waited.

“Dad…Dads not there.” Sofia kept her eyes on the oven as muffins grew. 

“He's probably busy Li, why don't you come help me with breakfast.” Sofia's words pulled Liam into the kitchen as he propped him up on a stool. Sofia showed Liam had to roll dough into little triangles. Sofia tucked little bits of meat and eggs into the dough. Sofia's eyes shifted as Doge walked across the hall into the bathroom. 

It didn't take long before the oven beeped. The breakfast rolls still needed some time but the muffins were ready. Before long Amber popped out into the open. Dressed still for bed she hopped into the living room as she scooped up a muffin. Sofia grit her teeth as Amber through her feet up on the coffee table. 

“We eat there.” Sofia's words pulled Amber's feet to the floor. Amber quickly sat up. 

“Oh sorry, look I don't want to intrude, so just tell me if I'm being too much.” Sofia's mind snagged on her last two words. She exited the kitchen with a spray bottle and paper towel. 

“You’re not too much, you're just right, just no feet where we eat,” Sofia said, cleaning off the coffee table. Doge quickly joined Amber on the couch as they decided what to watch. The girls quietly fought over programming as Brian left his room. Food pulled him into the kitchen.

“I helped makes food.” Liam's bright voice brought a smile to Brian's face as he ruffled Liam's hair. Brian sat next to him as he scooped up a muffin. “Like like muffins.” Liam's feet swung as he chomped on his food. Sofia leaned in so only Brian could hear her. 

“How is she doing?” Brian's eyes shifted to see Amber and Doge content on the couch. Brian shifted as he moved around the bar. A wrapped breakfast roll took up space in Brian's mouth before he spoke.

“She hasn't mentioned it yet, but I've been invited to meet her parents.” The conversation continued in the kitchen as another took place on the couch. 

“No no, it isn't real, that's just a recording device that sucks.” Amber was trying her best to explain how foolish it was that anything in these ghost shows are real while Doge was completely brainwashed into the show.

“Blah blah blah, it's real I've heard them.” Amber pulled up on her knees debating Doge. Amber and Brian couldn't help but watch them argue the realism of ghost hunting. 

Once everyone had eaten the sun was hitting its peak. Liam locked himself down in front of his TV as the girls piled on the couch. Brian opened the door for Sugar as she greeted everyone pulling herself inside. Amber introduced herself as she swapped herself for Sugar. Brian leaned Liam's room watching play video games.

“Hey, I'm taking off but we will be back tonight.” Brian was sure Liam's attention span was taken up by the TV and he couldn't even hear him. That was until Liam ran to Brian hugging him. 

“Have fun Dad.” Brian hugged his son back before leaving the room. Amber let her eyes scan the room before Brian pulled her outside into the hall. Amber slipped her hands into her pockets as they made their way to the stairs. Once outside Amber took a big deep breath soaking in the sun's rays. Brian grabbed her hand pulling her through the parking lot. 

Once on the road Brian just kicked back. They drove in silence as Amber tried to dodge the sun. Her torn visor did its best but it wasn't enough. 

“So is there anything I should know before we get there?” Brian's question seemed to add a little friction to her driving. Before she could answer she rolled down her window shouting at the driver in front of them as they stopped abruptly. 

“I swear everyone is trying to piss me off today, no you of course.” Amber relaxed her nerves as she pulled off the highway. “Well my parents are very overprotective, umm they seem to like you from what I've told them, they are very condescending and like to get under my skin, and sometimes I hate them.” Amber's hands gripped the wheel tight. “But they're my parents.” Her voice softened as she relaxed her grip. 

The conversation stopped as they pulled into what seemed to be a very rich neighborhood. Every house was two stories with a yard as green as a forest. Amber slowed down her driving as the bright neighborhood took over. Brian scanned all the perfect homes until the car stopped. A bright white suburban stood tall in front of them. Two electric cars were parked in the driveway. Amber pulled right in front of the house as she turned off the car. They sat motionless before Amber pulled Brian to her lips. Once Amber was satisfied she popped open her door. The pair stepped out onto the asphalt as they closed their doors. Amber took Brian’s hand as led him up the sidewalk path. Garden gnomes greeted them as they walked to the door. Before Amber could even knock the door opened.

“Ahhh you must be Brian!” Brian was immediately scooped up into a hug. He couldn't do much as a three-way hug was issued. “I'm Janice and this is my husband Greg.” Janice was about Brian's height with short black hair pulled behind her ears. Greg was tall with short gray hair shaved on the side. They were both dressed like they were entertaining the governor. 

“Oh very friendly, obviously yes that's me.” Amber rolled her eyes as they were led inside. Their house was immaculate. Brian couldn't find anything out of place no matter how hard he tried. As they passed by the first living room his eyes stopped. A trophy case caught his attention. Brian bent down as he noticed a picture of Amber. And then another. There was a picture of her standing with her second place swimming trophy, a picture of her with a first place math liege trophy, a picture of her with the marching band. In all the photos Amber looked alone and as the years moved up the happiness seemed to leave her face.

“Ahh you see our prized cabinet, you see our daughter was gifted at almost everything.” Greg ran his hand along the glass describing everything Amber was good at as he prefaced the word was. There was certainly one thing not mentioned at all.

“Let's not forget she could put the pros out of business with her guitar playing.” As Brian pulled himself up with his words they fell on silence. Janice just interjected, leading them to the dinner table.

“Well yes, but that kinda music doesn't do anything for anyone dear.” Amber crossed her arms as she sat down at the table.

“What do you mean? It calms the mind, I play myself, infact Amber got me into it, you know she plays other instruments too, she's teaching my son to play the trumpet.” His words froze them. Amber just stood quickly spreading food onto plates. Greg and Janice just looked at each other with worried faces.

“You know Amber didn't tell us you had a daughter, single dad?” Brian turned to Amber who was keeping her head down at her mother's question. 

“Not exactly, I raise him with my best friend who is the mother.” Her parents locked up. Amber just made Brian's plate quickly not wanting to talk one bit. “She's gay, and she wanted to have a child so I said I would be the father.” And just like that she spoke.

“You don't have to say she gay.” Everyone turned to Amber. Her eyes darted around at everyone.

“Well she is, I just think context is important.” Amber pulled herself up more.

“What context? That there is no worry of you cheating on me with her?” Brian froze. He didn't know how to respond. 

“Are you worried that he might?” Janice chimed in, drawing attention to herself.

“No, I just think it's dumb to say she's gay, that has nothing to do with the story, I'm straight, is that in the story?” Brian again didn't know what to say.

“Well people don't say ‘look at this straight woman that won all these awards’ do they?” All eyes turned to Greg. “I'm saying when you're gay it helps.”

“Oh so if I was gay I would have achieved more?!” Amber grabbed the table as her voice raised. 

“So Brian we understand you're a teacher.” Amber just sat back down as her mother turned the conversation. “The pay isn't the best but it's noble work, Amber I'm sure you could take cue from Brian.” Amber's foot kicked the table making the food bounce. The tension was thick so Brian tried to cut through it.

“Yes I teach history to six graders, it is rewarding enough.” Amber kept her head down as she quietly ate. The conversation continued as Liam was brought up and then Brian asked what they did. Talks of academia flooded the table as they told the story of meeting as college professors. Just as things seemed to settle down Greg changed the subject.

“Amber I noticed a large sum dumped into the account, you picking up extra work?” Amber's hands rolled into fists on the table. 

“Actually I paid you guys back for helping her.” The pair looked at each other as they discussed the money sink Amber's apartment is. “Actually her lease is up, she's living with me.” 

“Good, as long as you still have your job, I tell you apartments are not what they used to be.” Janice’s words seemed sincere and relaxed. Amber's face stuffing caught the side of her father as he stabbed his steak.

“Slow down hunny, what is he not feeding you? Christ, are you in the habit again?” His voice roared as Amber shot up.

“You want to check my arm? Better yet why don't you drug test me right here! I'm sure you wouldn't mind right Brian.” The table turned into a quick frenzy.

“I was only asking!” Greg stood leaning over the table.

“Yeah the question you've been waiting to ask!” Janice stood quickly jumping in.

“We only worry dear.” Brian let his blood relax as he ate. He blocked out everything as the steak melted in his mouth. Brian finally stood up with everyone.

“Wow that food was amazing, but look at the time, gotta put Liam to bed, babe let's go.” Brian swiped Amber's arm as she turned away from her parents. Amber walked towards the door as Brian turned to her parents. “She's something isn't she?” They said nothing, just waiting for his next words. “I love her, you know that, and when she's with me she's happy, don't worry I'm taking care of her.” They both locked up as Brian followed Amber out. Brian walked out the door before walking right back in. “Swimming is bullshit!” And like that he left with a smile on his face. Brian just climbed into the van next to Amber. “So you really swam?” Amber just rolled her eyes as she started the car. “I mean I saw that cute little butt tucked into that swimsuit, do you still..” Before he could finish his sentence she started hitting him repeatedly. 

“OMG shut up gross, let's just go.” And like that they were off.

1gz65pe,https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/1gz65pe/has_anyone_heard_of_overlanding_if_so_what_are/,"Has anyone heard of overlanding? If so, what are your thoughts on it?","**MY THOUGHTS**

Overlanding is exploding in popularity. Mainly in help of the pandemic. I think Overlanding is glorified car dependency and a materialism trap, that prays on more outdoorsy people, and another way for the auto industry to make profit, and the whole culture is honestly green washed as it promotes eco tourism in a completely wrong way, that only profits oil and auto industries. The worst part is the activity, isn't much of an activity.

**Definiton(to me)**

Overlanding is similar to van life, except it is primarily ""offroad driving""(I say in quotes because its normally just fire roads a corolla can drive through) and they normally don't live full time in them(usually weekend trips) and they camp, except everything is connected to the car. The ""community"" defines it as vehicle based travel that is about the journey not the destination. Makes me wanna puke.

**The Stupid Youtubers**

Anyways my Youtube algorithm sends me a lot of these overland videos and they are heinous and boring to watch. Its literally dudes with brand new 4x4s that they shove 60k of modifications(crap) and overpriced camping gear(more crap) on. They drive to national forests or scenic BLM lands take these drone shots with horribly cringe narration about how they are finding their spiritual awakening or some bullshit.  Then they drive on these boring(yet I'll admit beautiful) dirt roads as if they are going to die at any moment. They pull up to a lake and camp, make a stupid asmr video of them making a cup of coffee with a $200 jetboil. Then proceed with more drone shots and Boom, that's the video. Literarily every single video is like this that I've clicked on. I don't understand how they get so much views because your just watching a guy camp.

My point is overlanding in its self isn't much, its just car camping. I think it needs another activity to justify its existence like canoeing, hiking, fishing, mountain biking, painting, Hell even off-roading because most barely do that. Probably because they don't want to risk damaging their 60k emotional support vehicle. Without anything else its boring, trust me I've tried it. And often most people that are into this don't do any another activity with it. I just get a feeling that they are more obsessed with the ""rig"" (the object) than the actual activity. The recovery gear and mods they do to the cars are totally unnecessary because they are driving on roads that they will never need to use them on. But the industry is so good at fear mongering that is uses ""what ifs"" or the classic ""better to have it and not need it, than to not have it and need it"" tactic to rob you. Lots of the gear you don't need even if you were on a crazy 4x4 trail. The proper 4x4 community, although has its own flaws, hates and dogs on Overlanders all the time for the mindless consumerism, lack of experience, and going on wimpy trails.

**Destroying the Environment**

I also think the Overlanding Trend is drawing in a lot of people that are into cars, because Its more about the vehicle than the going into nature, just watch any Overland Expo video. These car enthusiasts people tend to not have a lot of education regarding the environment or climate change (that should be self evident because they like the exact thing that's perpetuating both). Therefore when they go out to nature they treat it like trash. They illegally forage, litter, pollute waterways, disrupt habitats or wildlife and potentially cause forest fires. All while creating a massive carbon footprint. Combine that with the lack of forest service in the US to maintain and educate the growing overland community, it creates a recipe for disaster.

**Conclusion**

I like to call Overlanding ""lets get fat and destroy nature"" because you are driving 90% of the time and when your not driving your either eating or sleeping. Anyways I am looking for ways to camp and enjoy nature that are healthy for me and nature. Sadly this trend is not American specific and is exploding all over the globe. I want to soon try bike backpacking. I do own a very old 4x4 but sparingly use it, I really only use it for trail running(with my legs), surf trips where I bring buddies and very difficult offroad trips. And when I do drive it, I try my best to be a steward of the land. Other than that I mainly ride my bike. Aware of my own hypocrisy, I am on lots of these ""overland online groups"", how should I go about educating people this is kind of bullshit and ruining the environment?

1gz64uv,https://imgur.com/a/iEpl9Vc,Which pesty fly do I have?,"I have stared at so many pictures and still can’t figure it out for sure. Here is an album of macro phone pics and phone pics through my son’s magnifying glass. It’s a pretty cheap one and I couldn’t adjust it enough to get it all in one shot. 

By visual my guess was fruit fly but only because of the lack of long segmented antennae and reddish brown eyes. 

Behavior: This makes me question fruit fly. They weren’t hanging out by the apples I had on the counter (I did put those in the fridge in case). They don’t care about the apple cider vinegar traps I put out. They mainly hang out on the ceiling, cabinet doors, door frames, and near the coffee maker. I do occasionally see them by the garbage can or near the sink if someone left food on a plate. 

I have mostly been vacuuming them off the ceiling. If I approach slowly, it’s pretty easy but if I get close too fast, they fly off. I’ve been able to swat them with my hand and even sucked one or two out of the air with the vacuum. 

At one point I got down to two in a day and then I got sick and wasn’t getting them and the first day I felt better I counted close to 16. ",1,1732494792.0,pestcontrol,2,1.0,False

I guess it’s on me for growing complacent around Iolo and not taking the necessary precautions. I mean, don't get me wrong, I *know* how dangerous he is, but somehow, after spending so much time with him, I grew used to the danger.

That's why when I got to work the morning after my little drinking party with Iolo, I didn’t tell anyone about our deal to have dinner together. Dumb, I know. Trust me, I'm not going to make such a mistake again. But at this point I just felt didn't feel like dealing with all the “he likes you” jokes that were sure to come my way (by the way I don't want to hear *anything* from your lot in the horny jail,I still blame you for all this). Plus, while I’d have loved to taunt Wes and Victor about how good the bottle was as punishment for having me deliver it alone, it didn’t seem worth facing whatever revenge they would have planned for not sharing with them. And more than anything, I knew Dreidre would insist to come, and Iolo had made it clear her presence wasn’t welcome. Hence my brilliant idea to keep the whole thing secret until it was over and bring Dreidre to Dillon's afterward as an apology. You know this stupid girl in horror movies that always seems to make just the wrong choice? Yup, that's me.

That's how I ended up standing before Dillon's at 8 o’clock, waiting for possibly the worst neighbor I knew with no weapons, no back up plan, and no one knowing where I was. At least I didn’t have to wait long, as not even two minutes After I arrived, I saw an all-too-familiar blue truck pull up in the parking lot. At least, for all his flaws, the banjo bastard was punctual. 

“Howdy” the smile on his lips appeared genuine, but the look on his eyes made me uneasy.

It wasn’t his usual sharp glance, but it somehow was even more predatory. I barely suppressed a chiver.

“We should go in.” I said, moving toward the entrance to escape his gaze. 

Before I could open the door, Iolo beat me to it.


He motioned for me to enter with a mocking smile “After you.” the scene strangely similar to the first time we got there’

“What a gentleman.” This time I didn’t make an effort to sound sincere, the smile on Iolo's face growing crisped. Good. I saw no reason to be the only one spending an awful evening. My resolution to ruin Iolo dinner put me in a far better mood, and I made my way inside with a smile on my face.

To my surprise, we were seated by the same girl as last time. To my bigger surprise, she still blushed when looking at Iolo. I was both glad he hadn’t decided to take advantage of her crush and appalled at how well he hid being a complete bastard. It made sense in a way. With such a small town, it wouldn't have taken long for rumors to spread if he started acting evil in public.

Since I was paying, I decided to at least try to enjoy the food despite the company and ordered the biggest and greasiest burger on the menu. The kind of item I always dreamed of ordering while never actually doing it because there was absolutely no way of eating it without looking like a pig. But hey, at least being with Iolo meant I didn’t have to care about my image. As for Iolo he ordered french fries and some vegetable thing named Tofu Scramble. I.kid.you.not. Of all things, I never imagined fucking Iolo to be a vegetarian. I mean, what's the use of such big ass teeth if he is just going to eat vegetables? At least, I guess that means I'm not going to have to worry about him eating *me* so that’s good.

I rapidly calculated the cost of what he took in my head. French fries were 4$ and the Tofu Scramble 15$ (I still can’t believe this thing was almost twice the price of my burger. Crazy). Even if we added drinks and coffee, it was still going to be too far off from the 50$ we had agreed on. 

“You sure you don’t want anything else? ”. I asked carefully, “I still owe you.”

He snorted, laying back lazily on his chair. “Don’t worry Puppydog, you’ll pay me in due time. I intend to order more.”.

His words didn't sit well with me. I didn’t want to be dragged back for a second dinner because he considered I hadn't paid my due.

“I’d rather if you're ordered now. No need to leave it hanging.” I insisted, my jaw tensed.

Bastard winked at me. 

“Well, if it makes you feel better, I’ll order some more.”.

Calling back the waitress, Iolo added some onion rings and garlic bread, as well as some silly sounding smoothie. Keeping track of price in my head I frowned, it was better but still not 50.

Iolo watched me with a mocking smile, still relaxing on his chair “I’ll also take some waffles, bagel and pancakes for desserts since you so nicely offered.”.

Of course the bastard would know what I was thinking about. But with his additions, I'd be just above 50$, which meant my debt would officially be paid back. Asshole could choke on a mountain of sugar and die of diabetes for all I cared, at least I'd be free.

The news relaxed me so much that I somehow managed to pass the rest of the dinner in a pleasant mood. Iolo also seemed to enjoy the meal, as he actually managed not to be too much of an ass. I’m not gonna lie, if I didn’t know him better I'd probably have found him charming. And given the looks our waitress gave him, I know for a fact *she* found him charming. By the time she brought us dessert, I saw her slip a paper under his cup of coffee and felt myself grow pale. If she had written her name on it… 

Not knowing what to do, I panicked and grabbed Iolo hand, attempting to play the part of the affective girlfriend. He raised an amused eyebrow in answer.

“How rare of you to be so affectionate, Nessa.” He whispered, a smirk tugging at his lips. 

His hand cupped at my jaw, and leaning over the table, he kissed me. Not just his usual peck on the lips, but a true lasting kiss. I tensed but didn’t dare to resist him, both for fear of angering him and for worry it would encourage our poor waitress to give him her number. To my relief, from the corner of my eyes I saw her take back the paper and crumple it before hastily posing out desserts on the table and leaving. Good. A kiss was a little price to pay compared to a life. 

“Oh, so you made up. It's good news.” a vaguely familiar-sounding voice interrupted from behind. 

Turning around, I felt myself grow pale. Of course, with my luck I’d run in the Pruitts. The wife looked at me with a beaming smile. 

“I was worried given what you told us last time, but it’s reassuring to see everything worked out.”. She gave me an encouraging smile, not realizing every word she was saying was digging my grave deeper.

“Yes.” I answered curtly, hoping to cut her off before she let something even more incriminating slip. “yes everything is better now. I overreacted.”

Her husband rolled his eyes before taking her arm to lead her away “You see, I told you you worried too much. Young people will be young, now let them be. Can’t you see you’re bothering them?”.

I turned toward Iolo, praying to every deity into existence he wouldn't have looked in the Pruitts eyes and would somehow just think the whole thing was about the Jeep. One glance at him let me know my prayers were in vain. He was absolutely livid.

“I can explain.” I beginning.

He didn't let me finish “ Not now.”. His voice was so cold that for once I didn't try to talk back. I hadn’t seen him this mad since I named him.

The rest of the dinner was silent. Not even the sweetness of the deserts managing to relax Iolo tensed form.

When the time came to leave, I exited the dinner feeling as though I was walking to my funeral. I hadn’t even taken a weapon with me. Only some salt. Maybe if I threw it at him I could win some time and make it to the Jeep to grab my shotgun or *Ratcacher*? Doubtful. And somehow it didn’t seem like a good idea to make Iolo even madder than he was.

He opened the door to his truck.

“Get in.”

I protested. If I got into this truck, I was dead.

“We agreed to come separately and leave separately.”.

Before I could react, my ass was thrown inside. Disoriented, I scrambled to open the door but Iolo caught my hand. He was already seated in the driver seat.

I tried not to let the panic pierce into my voice 
“ We agreed to come separately and leave separately!”.

He turned the engine on, ignoring me.

“We had a deal!” This time I couldn't keep the desperation off my voice.

He chuckled “Oh don't worry Puppydog, I'm not taking you home. Well leave separately alright *after* we talked.”

This didn't reassure me in the slightest.

“Where are you taking me?” I asked, my mind working at full speed to find an escape plan.

He gave me a nasty stare. “You didn't think you were gonna escape training, did you Puppydog ? And oh boy, do you need training. I sure didn’t educate you well, did I? Spreading *lie* and whatnot about me.”

I felt my heart drop. Oh God. Of course he wouldn't just find the fact I spread a rumor about him being a crazy ex insulting, he would take it as a lie. A lie about him. Oh God. 

“I’m… I didn't mean it that way.” I begged barely catching the apology before it slipped from my lips. “ I’ll go and correct them. I'll make sure everybody knows the truth.”

“So what?” He spat “So you get to just lie and not pay the price? It doesn't work like that Puppydog. You don't lie about me and get away with it.”

That's it, I thought. That was how I was going to die.

“I didn't mean to *lie*.” I said honestly. I hated how my voice just cracked at the last word, almost a sob, but the idea I was just going to die without even a fair chance to fight was just too awful “What can I do to make it right?”.

Iolo stayed silent for so long that I thought he was just going to ignore my question. When he talked, his voice was thoughtful. “I won’t have to punish you if it’s not a lie.”

I looked at him, not understanding what he meant. “What?”

He gave an annoying sight “I’m mad ‘cause you spread all over the town that I was your asshole ex, now reconciled, boyfriend. Thing is,  we never really dated Puppydog. But if you date me now, I'll be lenient and overlook chronology and consider what you said as truful. Anyway, you owe me quite a few dinners, I'm sure rumors would have spread on their own.”

My burger lurched in my stomach and I almost threw up right there. By some miracle, I managed to hold it in. “I…I have a girlfriend” I 
stuttered. “And I just bought you dinner.”.

He had the nerve to laugh “Ah two timing Puppydog? Not a good idea. I don’t like to share. I can overlook you playing along with *caoineadh* before, but if we’re to be together it’ll have to stop. As for dinner you paid back *one* sip but I remember you having quite a few. 28 to be exact. You should be glad. It was a nice bottle, yet I let you have way more than me. Guess I'm a better boyfriend than expected.” He winked at me, offering me a satisfied smile.

Realization hit me like a brick. He tricked me. He offered me more drinks, but he never specified it was free. Why did I assume it was free? I *knew* better. And now I owned him 28 dinners. My paycheck was never going to survive. It was going to take me *months* before I could pay it back. How was I going to announce to Dreidre that I'd have to go out 28 times with him? How was I going to announce to Deidre he expected me to *date* him?

“Of course, it’s up to you Puppydog.” Continued Iolo “I'm not gonna force you, if you prefer to be a *liar* you can just pay the usual price. So, what’s it gonna be? ",2,1732494580.0,atypicalpests,0,1.0,False

She tends to lean towards romance, fiction, and thriller books and I lean more towards science fiction, fantasy, and horror. For the most part, a lot of our tastes overlap, which I love, since growing up I didn’t have many friends that were really into books and reading. In fact, I love reading and books so much I went into a lot of student debt to get a BA in publishing (which I’ve yet to be able to use at any work place but this is relevant.)

However, over the last four or so months, I’ve noticed a pattern of conversation when we’ve talked about reading and books specifically. It’s been rubbing me the wrong way, and me pointing it out has led to a bit of a disagreement between us. 

The majority of the time that I’ve noticed this pattern is when we’re out at a restaurant or cafe together or with other friends from the various book clubs that we’ve attended. I’m not the talkative type of person so I tend to take a back seat in the majority of the conversations that happen around me, and I genuinely enjoy listening to others talk about their passions. Here’s the thing, every time I do jump in and talk about a book that I love or am currently reading, Leslie specifically, will either cut me off and/or talk over me or she will change the subject mid way through me speaking. It’s disheartening when I noticed it the first few times, but Leslie tends to talk over others a lot and do most of the talking. But it just keeps happening. 

At first, I thought I was just being overly sensitive, which in full transparency, I do sometimes take things to heart when I shouldn’t. However, as time went on and I noticed it more and more, I also noticed that she didn’t do it as much to others when we were with friends, letting them rant and rave about whatever book they were reading. Her comments always came off as pointed at me, even when more than one person was talking at the table. Again, I would jump in and talk about what I was reading, and these are just some of the remarks I’ve been met with: 

“That’s cool, but I want to talk about (a different book). Have you read it? You really should because it has X,Y, and Z in it…”

“Oh yeah, I heard about that book, it didn’t sound any good but I’m glad you liked it,” 

“Okay, we get it, you really liked that book.” 

“Sorry, I stopped listening half way through you talking, but I was reading this great book the other day that you just have to read…”

“Oh no, I could never read something like that, that just sounds like too much…everything.”

“Ugh, that book was so boring, I couldn’t even finish it…”

“Okay, hun, I love you but I literally have no idea what you’re talking about right now. So why don’t we figure out what we want to order for food,” ( while saying this, she was waving her hand in front of her and shaking her head to get me to stop talking.)

That last one kind of stung because I was telling her about a science fiction series that meant a lot to me and was a story that I held close to my heart, and this is coming from someone that I see as a close friend. 

I had mentioned these instances in passing to her as nothing serious, but she brushed them off, not understanding what I was saying. So I pushed the issue to the side and kind of held my tongue on the matter and told myself I would wait for a better opportunity to bring it up and discuss it in a more private setting. Besides, at the time, I was still having fun being there and listening to everyone else talk.

Well, weeks went by and nothing really changed in this pattern but I did connect a lot with two other women in one of the book clubs that love a lot of books that I adore. We would often break away from the greater conversation and have side conversations with each other and get excited when we realized we had the same books on our tbr (to be read) lists. We mesh really well together and I’m really happy to consider them friends! 

I guess me gravitating towards the other group was noted and Leslie questioned why I opted to sit closer to them and chat rather than my other friends and her. (Granted, I would still move back over to them at some point as well and make small talk with my friends. It wasn’t like I was completely ignoring them.) I told Leslie that me and the other two women loved a lot of the same books that I knew she didn’t like and didn’t want to bore or annoy her with our conversation. 

She told me we didn’t have to do that, which in a way, she did have a point. 

Up until a few weeks ago, this pattern continued whenever I started talking. Leslie would talk over me or cut me off, I would just give up and stop talking to the group in general and would have short, side conversations with others closer to me. Again, still trying to make the most of the conversation and time at hand. 

The turning point in this pattern was when, a book I had suggested was picked as next month’s book club read. I was super excited at first, since I had already read it and given this book 5 stars. Leslie made it known to the group that she already knew she wasn’t going to like the book and probably wouldn’t even bother to read it. Since our tastes in books were so similar, her saying that hurt a little bit but I didn’t say anything about it. Similar as our taste in books are, we don’t like what we don’t like. I told myself not to take it personally (even though I had told her how much I loved this books and I hoped it would be a book club pick in the future.) 

Whenever I talked about the book with others in front of her, she would very obviously be disengaged with the conversation. Taking out her phone and ignoring us. My (sort of) final straw, was when Leslie, another friend from the book club, and I went to get coffee and read together. Myself and this friend were having a very in depth conversation about the book club book. We talked about the themes that were in the book, the author’s writing style, etc. Leslie sighed heavily and told us that she was tired of hearing us talk about the book. 

“We get it, you went to college for reading, you don’t have to be so pretentious about everything you read,” Leslie said. 

I didn’t know how to respond to her, truly, but my other friend did. 

“She’s not being pretentious? We’re literally just talking about shit that was in the book?” Was her response. 

I was dejected and hurt so I didn’t know what to say. I had never been called pretentious before and it bothered me a lot. 

Leslie huffed and said whatever, rolling her eyes and pulled out her phone. There was obvious tension in the air after that and we just stopped talking and started to read our books. I did leave to use the restroom, because, yes I did cry about that. 

It was awkward after that and we sort of just parted ways once the check came. 

It’s been about two weeks since that happened and I just never brought up books around her. We’ve still hung out but I noticed that she also didn’t bring up anything related to reading either. She also didn’t acknowledge her comment that she made to me, but then again, I also didn’t bring it up to her again, waiting to see if she would bring it up and talk about it. 

I’ve never been in a situation like this but honestly, since we stopped talking about books and reading, I’ve found myself taking a sigh of relief. It does suck a little bit because I do miss some of the conversations that we’ve had, but I think it’s for the best.

It gets to 6pm and I begin sweeping my bedroom. Most people do it to music etc but I was just having a quick sweep to bring the week in. I then start to hear the most ridiculous banging so I start to record. I was literally shaking by this point. I live alone in a one bedroom flat I’m black work in a school 34 bellow me are two white guys. 

As you can hear in the video the noise is me sweeping you hear the banging me called a c word and a n word. He then called his sister on the phone to intimidate. 

While the sister was outside shouting as loud as she can I’m here I’m here then banging. I asked the lady on the phone if she heard and she said yes all recorded. I told them I have the recording of them calling me a n word. The banging and I feel intimidated and unsafe. I was told they will get back to me. Personally I’ve never called the police and just usually prepared to defend myself/legally and safe 

To my shock it’s now 00:13 and the police didn’t call me back and the banging laughing trying to provoke me continued. 

Is this right? Anyone else had anything similar? 


August 29th 8am I was woken to Ibiza music full volume (constant parties drugs people in and out. Them singing the words to racist songs all recorded) I shouted shut the f up, I was told to shut the f up I’m a rat the usual banging whatever, when I went to make my coffee I saw the police arriving and heard him making a statement about me, could mainly hear the words her and she but I had it recorded ready to defend but didn’t hear from the police(I do wonder what was said)To my shock the police leave and less than 5 mins they have a drug drop off over the gate and I record this.

Looking at the way things are I most likely am lesbian (a very lonely one 😭) and I am fine with that but it just all happened so fast one day and hasn't stopped and that's what made me so confused. It doesn't help that I do already look and act like a stereotypical lesbian (short dyed hair, wears mens clothes, I love coffee, etc.) and many people always ask me if I am lesbian I am just scared of people reacting badly too it as many people joke about lesbians were I live and many guys have said they love watching lesbians (gross ik).... 

I am just really stuck atm with all these thoughts and feelings and I am craving a relationship so bad I feel so alone and I am so jealous of the lesbians I see happy together (WHY CANT THAT BE ME 😭💔💔). I want to live my life as the person I truly am (I try my best to in a range of different ways) and part of that is most likely that I am infact a lesbian.

I've been on quite a journey trying to find the perfect coffee machine, and I thought I'd share my experience to help others who might be in the same boat. After trying countless machines and spending way too much money, I think I've finally cracked the code.

First off, let's be real - there's no one-size-fits-all when it comes to coffee machines. What works for a busy family might not work for a single person who just wants their morning fix. But there are definitely some standout options that I've discovered.

After months of research and testing, I found some amazing deals on coffee machines here: https://athometouch.com/coffeemachine. They've got everything from basic drip brewers to fancy espresso makers.

Here's what I've learned:

For beginners or those who want something simple:
- Drip coffee makers are reliable and easy to use
- Pod machines are super convenient but can be pricier in the long run
- French press is great for rich flavor but requires more effort

For the coffee enthusiasts:
- Semi-automatic espresso machines give you control over your brew
- Bean-to-cup machines are amazing but can be expensive
- Pour-over setups offer incredible flavor clarity

I personally started with a basic drip machine but upgraded to a semi-automatic espresso maker. The difference in taste is incredible! My morning routine has completely changed - I actually look forward to making coffee now.

Some key features to consider:
- Brewing capacity (how many cups do you need?)
- Counter space (some machines are huge!)
- Maintenance requirements (some need more cleaning than others)
- Extra features (milk frothers, programmable settings, etc.)

If you're feeling overwhelmed by all the options, I'd recommend checking out the selection here: https://athometouch.com/coffeemachine. They've got detailed reviews and comparisons that really helped me make my decision.

Pro tip: Whatever machine you choose, investing in a good grinder and quality beans makes a massive difference. Trust me, I learned this the hard way!

Remember, the best coffee machine is the one that fits your lifestyle, budget, and coffee preferences. Don't feel pressured to buy the most expensive one - sometimes simpler is better.

But I have an issue with getting overly excited and attached to people like it's a ""crush"" even if it's purely platonic, and so I have a tendency to overstep my boundaries and just generally being kinda smothering (eg always try to talk to them). What makes things even more complicated is that I'm older (M, ""late-20s/early 30s"" range) and she is college-age. She's also a seasonal staff with unpredictable schedule, while I'm permanent FT, so I'm constantly worrying that I won't see her again and that makes me even more anxious and pushy.

It was super awkward and I just sat there quietly eating lunch beside her, but thankfully it gave me some time before I felt comfortable starting a conversation. It was a lovely chat, but not long after she had to go back to her shift, and in that brief moment when she was leaving I asked if she'd be comfortable exchanging contacts while scrambling to tell her a bunch of gibberish explaining that it's been really difficult making friends with people especially cuz I never know when ppl will suddenly stop having shifts. She was kind enough to exchange numbers with me, but I feel she only did it because she felt bad/pressured.

Anyway, since then I've decided to pull back on initiating convos to give her some space that I'm pretty sure she needs (especially with increasing exam stress). I'm trying to focus back on my own things, but in the back of my mind I'm still kinda anxious about what to do next. I'm super grateful for her contact and that has eased my anxiety a ton. I've asked some folks on reddit and looked up things online and people seem to say it'd be chill to ask ppl out to grab a coffee/lunch to establish friendships and ""what do you have to lose!"", but I dont know... I don't want to just go back to being pushy and make her uncomfortable/annoyed, but also I doubt there will be much ""natural opportunities"" that arise that magically gives us time together to chat and get to know each other. In my experience most acquaintances stay acquaintances, so I feel I'd have to do \*something\* if I want to establish an actual friendship with this person. I could just passively ""see how it goes"" but I'm so darn impatient.

1 - My name is Sean.

B - I’m 40 years old 🎉

3 - I’m Scottish! I was born in a small town in Scotland. I've travelled a lot and was lucky enough to have a fun job when I was younger that let me see the world.

4 - I’m currently working as an engineering technician. I accidentally fell into this job and I really can’t complain too much. I spend most of the week working from home, drinking tea/coffee and lurking in the background of Zoom meetings while trying to figure out how to do something a little bit more exciting for work. I feel like I need to be doing something more creative with my time on this planet.

E - It’s not unusual to find me lost in a Spotify hole with my headphones on, hunting for new music and creating playlists. If you have any music suggestions, I'd love to hear them. In turn, if you are looking for a suggestion, i'm here to help.

F - I love to draw/sketch/doodle and I’ll ALWAYS be up for drawing something for the people I chat with. I thrive when someone gives me an idea and its also a great way to see what goes on in someone’s head 😊

7 - I like to go to the gym. I've seen a few people post recently that they were looking for someone to effectively be their gym friend. I quite like this idea and would happily do that. Routine advice, encouragement and just someone to keep each other company in-between sets.

8 - I also like to sink some time into games. I have a backlog that I’m never ever going to get through. I've just started Stardew Valley again so that's me doomed.

But I have an issue with getting overly excited and attached to people like it's a ""crush"" even if it's purely platonic, and so I have a tendency to overstep my boundaries and just generally being kinda smothering (eg always try to talk to them). What makes things even more complicated is that I'm older (M, ""late-20s/early 30s"" range) and she is college-age. She's also a seasonal staff with unpredictable schedule, while I'm permanent FT, so I'm constantly worrying that I won't see her again and that makes me even more anxious and pushy. And knowing my anxious pushiness makes me even more anxious and worried I'd annoy her and scare her away (rejection sensitivity on max).

He gave me chocolates din and nalaman niya I love Ferrero so yun ang binigay niya. 

The things is, he has a partner and two kids. Very No-No and I don’t shit where I eat. 

I don’t usually join sa mga “team building” na yan but this time I did kasi kasama naman kumare ko. Sinubukan niya lumapit, ako na lumalayo ng pwesto. Nag videoke. Ganda ng boses ni mokong. He chose a song for me to sing. I don’t sing sa harap ng ibang tao. Pero napilitan ako. And he requested another one. “Shit bagay na bagay sa boses mo, madam” yan ang tawag niya sa akin. 

Sigeng tagay nila sa akin pero ang ending sila ang nalasing. Lol. Nagulat nalang sila come the next morning malinis na yung dinning area. Sabi ko “Dalawang mommies ang naiwan what do you expect?” Bagsak lahat ng men. Naiwan kami till 5am ng mare ko umiinom. Sorry siya ng sorry na hindi daw siya nakapag stay up ng matagal because this and that. “I don’t mind really.” Sabi ko sa kanya. 
At least I get to enjoy the pool na walang iniisip. 

Tagal niya hindi nakaharap sa akin after that. Nahiya ata. 

Over the weekend may “meeting” with all the bosses including him. Sa malayo sa kanya ako umupo. May seat na available sa tabi ko where I put my bag. Para di maupuan. All night long, hindi siya mapakali lipat ng lipat ng upuan. 

I’m wearing a dress na may slit. Hindi ko napansin na naka drape na yung one side sa floor. Nalaman ko nalang nung lumapit siya then biglang “madam itago mo muna ang legs mo. Mamaya na.” sabay hinawi yung dress ko ni tuck niya between my legs. Nagulat ako. I told my friend na wag na ko masyado bigyan ng drinks. I need to stay alert. 
Pero yung pinaka boss namin laging nagpapatagay. Kesyo daw di naman ako nalalasing. Jusko kumalat na nga na malakas ako uminom. Grabe sila. 

Mukang may amats na siya nung he suddenly transferred na talaga sa seat beside me. Alam mo yung sadyang knees touching ganun. Iniiwas ko na lang legs ko. Pero siya lalapit kunyari bubulong pa pero halos nasa leeg ko na. Tapos kunyari magjo-joke tapos makikipag high five pero hahawak na talaga at tagal bitawan ng kamay ko. (gaspang ng kamay niya). 😅
Tunalikuran ko nga. 

Around 1am “bumulong” na naman, sa leeg 🙄

He said “Ano na?” 

“Anong ano na?” Confused ako ng slight. 

“San tayo after nito?” He asked. 

“What do you mean?” 

“Gusto mo mag Tagaytay? Diba gusto mo magpunta dun last time?” 

“Silly. You’re drunk. You think you can drive that far? Dapat nga di na kayo nagdala ng car eh.” Inis na ako. Kasi ayaw ko talaga ng drunk driving. 

“Ito naman. Kaya ko noh! So saan tayo?” Slur slur na magsalita. 

Sa inis ko inannouced ko sa lahat yung question niya. Kala siguro niya. Hmp. “Guys saan daw tayo pupunta after nito?” Hahaha kamot ulo siya. 

Well lumipat pa rin naman kami ng venue. And naka 5 buckets pa. Until nagkayayaan ng umuwi. He offered to drive me home. Pero mahal ko pa buhay ko. Hahahahaha.

I [40F] once had a really good friend [35F] I’ll call her Sally for the story. Sally and I met through our children going to the same school and we hit it off. Sally would often come over after school drop off and we’d have a coffee at my house and she’d help me clean up the house as it’s something I struggle with sometimes.

My husband [34] and I like to have a drink at the weekends at the house and normally invite people over. We started inviting Sally and it was that way for years. She had a really traumatic upbringing and had no family (apart from her children) so my family took her in. We all treated her like family. In her own life she was successful and worked from home. Everybody was obsessed with her. 

I will admit I have my insecurities surrounding the way my husband and I met (he cheated to get with me) so I’m quite strict that he is fully open with me (including his phone and sharing social media etc). He doesn’t have any hobbies or go out with anyone unless I’m with him too. This is relevant later. 

I absolutely loved Sally, she would bend over backwards to help us wherever she could, including help with our little one. After about a year my husband started trying to flirt with her. She is 5’10 and absolutely stunning. This made me so angry. Sally made it quite clear she wasn’t interested and it was making her uncomfortable. A lot of the people that were around her at the time behaved in a similar way to her so I suppose she was used to it. 

Fast forward a couple of years and Sally comes over for her morning coffee. I start crying and tell her that my husband and I were arguing the night before and he tells me (his wife!) that he is in love with Sally. She is so taken aback by it and says maybe it’s best if we only hang out together away from my house. I don’t really like going out anywhere if I’m honest so it isn’t really an option. 

She then says she doesn’t think he loves her, he just doesn’t have any friends so he’s stuck to her which makes me really angry. 
Then she says at least it’s her and not somebody else because I know nothing will ever happen between him and her. 

I was in such a bad situation. I was angry at my husband, but I loved my friend too. I don’t work so I’m wholly dependant on my husband. I had asked him that out of anybody why did it have to be Sally and he said “it just is”.

To my shame, I decided Sally had to go as I had my family to think about. I told my parents (who adored Sally) that she had been making me feel bad about myself and thought she was after my husband. They cut her off quite quickly and told her why. Everybody fell out with Sally pretty much including most of our mutual friends. She moved away. People would ask me if it was true and I didn’t say they were, but didn’t deny it either. I was in a desperate situation. 

This led to a huge fight between Sally and I. She asked me when had she ever been anything but nice to me. I told her I couldn’t remember but that she had. She stopped speaking to me and we stopped being friends. There were a few nasty messages where she said I treat my husband like a prisoner and if I let him go out other than to work then he wouldn’t “fall in love” with other people. She also told me to stop being toxic and to get a job which made me so angry. 

She said she knew it was because of my husband apparently “falling in love” with her which is why I was behaving that way and she’d have respected me more if I just asked her to stop coming round rather than making up lies. 

I later received a message on my birthday off her and my husband received a happy birthday off her on his birthday. He didn’t tell me this so I texted her to stay away from my husband then blocked her on his phone. We had a huge row after and the rows have continued over the years even with her not around. It’s like her memory is haunting us. I blocked her from my life. This was a few years ago now and I miss her but I’m still angry. We don’t have many friends left and the ones we do were nothing like her.

It’s got me thinking recently because I spoke to one of our mutual friends who said Sally has become hugely successful. I’d love to reach out to her and apologise for my behaviour, but I’m worried my husband would fall in love with her again especially now she’s successful too. I’m struggling a lot right now with my children being difficult and I just know she’d know all the right things to try. I miss the friendship. It’s times like this you realise what you lost. I know I haven’t been a good friend.

Like… where could I find these lonely old people. I guess I could volunteer at an old folks home or something like that? I don’t know. I just watched a video where a guy approached a random old man and asked to take his pictures and then the old man asked him to coffee and I cried because I wish more old people had someone to go to coffee with.

The older folks in my life are fortunate to have good social circles and good enough health that they can get around, but I know not all people are that lucky. 

Can anyone think of a way I can hangout with older people and give them some company every once in a while? In the past I’ve thought of making some kind of internet advertisement offering services to hangout with an old person in your life, but I just worry about the safety risks of complete strangers contacting me.

I'm reading through Capital vol 1 and trying to break through the chapter 3 bottleneck. As I read through it I wonder how it is applicable to today because Marx is operating on the gold standard. Aside from this, I was having a debate with my father who is not a marxist (he's a ""liberal"" zionist) and he claims Marx's works are outdated because we are moving towards a model in which data is the most valuable asset a company can own. I will admit I am somwhat unfamiliar with the data economy. However, I understand that the data we produce is a commodity, it has a use value and a value. It's use value is its ability to target us with adds and its value is...something I don't fully understand just yet. Going back to the story, my father argues that now that the greatest asset companies own is data, marx's theory is irrelevant. I assume his logic follows a similar line to Varoufakis in that he thinks we are moving beyond capitalism in some way. However, I pointed out that that data requires massive servers to be built. He then argues that third party companies can be hired to build/hold the servers. I then point out that the servers still need to be built, and the rare earth minerals needed to create said servers are still mined in the African Continent (such as the congo) and Latin America, not to mention many products we still use today from clothing to coffee. Based on my conversations with him he seems to generalize the data economy as a worldwide phenomenon rather than another front in the abstraction of relations and alienation of commodities from workers. What books should I read, or what could I say to make my larger point that the core relations of capitalism still remain, the core contradiction between workers and the owners of private property, the contradiction between the monopolist banks and syndicates, the contradiction between the various bourgeoisie of capitalist nations as they seek to expand their empire, and the contradiction between the handful of ""civilized"" countries and the numerous imperial colonies (or rather neocolonies)?",6,1732492039.0,DebateCommunism,7,0.88,False

Embracing an Attitude of Gratitude That Can Transform Your Life  
  
  
  
Thanksgiving is a beautiful tradition—a time to reflect on what we’re grateful for. But why limit it to just one day? When practiced daily, gratitude can transform your life, helping you live with more joy, resilience, and purpose.  
  
  
  
When you intentionally focus on the good in your life, no matter how small, you create a ripple effect of positive change. Let’s explore how gratitude can transform your life and three simple practices you can start today.  
  
  
  
Five Ways Gratitude Can Change Your Life  
  
Improves Mental Health  
  
 Focusing on gratitude shifts your mindset away from stress and negativity. It helps you embrace positive emotions, reduce anxiety, and foster a greater sense of peace.  
  
  
  
Strengthens Relationships  
  
 When you show appreciation to others, you deepen your connection with them. Gratitude nurtures trust and builds stronger bonds with family, friends, and colleagues.  
  
  
  
Increases Resilience  
  
 Life is full of ups and downs, but gratitude helps you find the silver lining. It strengthens your ability to face challenges with hope and determination.  
  
  
  
Boosts Physical Health  
  
 Gratitude reduces stress, leading to better sleep, improved energy, and a more robust immune system. It’s like a natural prescription for wellness.  
  
  
  
Enhances Your Purpose  
  
 When you practice gratitude daily, you see life’s blessings more clearly. This clarity fuels your sense of purpose, helping you make decisions that align with your values.  
  
  
  
Three Gratitude Practices You Can Start Today  
  
Gratitude Journal  
  
 Take five minutes each morning or evening to write down three things you’re grateful for. Whether it’s the warmth of your coffee, a kind word from a friend, or the roof over your head, this practice will help you start or end your day with positivity.  
  
  
  
Gratitude Letters  
  
 Write a short note, text, or email to someone who has impacted your life. Please share why you appreciate them and the difference they’ve made. Not only will it brighten their day, but it will strengthen your connection with them.  
  
  
  
Mindful Moments  
  
 Pause throughout your day to reflect on what’s going well. Take a moment during a walk, meal, or quiet time to appreciate the beauty around you—whether it’s nature, a smile, or a sense of peace.  
  
  
  
Take Action to Transform Your Life  
  
Gratitude is a powerful tool, and when practiced daily, it can bring extraordinary changes to your life. These changes include improved mental health, stronger relationships, increased resilience, better physical health, and enhanced purpose. But sometimes, it helps to have guidance on your journey.  
  
  
  
Schedule a Complimentary Discovery Call with me, and together, we’ll create a personalized roadmap to help you cultivate gratitude and live with boldness, clarity, and joy.  
  
  
  
Bring Thanksgiving into every day so you can live with purpose and intention.  
  
  
  
Be Extraordinarily Bold!

The days stretch before me, not as a blank slate, but as a canvas already painted, layered with memories, emotions, fragments of life lived. How strange it is to live twice through pain: once in the moment, sharp and searing, and then again in the quiet cruelty of recollection. To write is not to escape, but to make peace—to sit beside these feelings, these specters of what was, and give them a voice.

They come, as they always do, without warning or permission. In the morning, as I sip my coffee, there they are, pulling at the edges of my thoughts. In the bath, they float up, unbidden, with the steam. During conversations, they whisper over the words of others, drowning them out, stealing my presence, my now. They are with me at the streetlight, just before the abrupt, jarring horn of the impatient driver behind me. They linger as I speak on the phone with clients, their obliviousness pressing against my own quiet discontent.

And when I speak with my son, they remain, lingering in the shadows, nudging my words. And I wonder, is this really me speaking, guiding, or is this anxiety made into words? 
Every interaction with him feels like an echo of something unresolved within me, as though I am nurturing not only the boy before me, but also the child I once was. His laughter, his worries, his questions—each stirs something in me, a quiet reckoning between who I was and who I am.

They are even with me when my eyes close for the night. They seep into my dreams, taking shape as long-buried memories, unbidden and unwelcome. Resurrected to haunt me, to remind me, to keep me chained to the past. I wake heavy, as though each memory is a boulder that has pressed against my chest through the night, leaving me gasping for the lightness of day. But morning does not bring reprieve.

These companions of mine—always whispering, always present—refuse to be ignored. And so, I write. Not to silence them, but to give them shape. These words are not mine; they belong to them, the uninvited guests who haunt and hold me. This is their voice.",0,1732491236.0,writingcritiques,1,0.5,False

I am wanting some help with my fitness goals and how to achieve them. I am a 25 year old woman who is 95kg, looking to lose 20kg. I do not have access to a gym (I live on a farm very far out of the nearest town. 

I have set what I believe are realistic goals, but when it comes to researching how to achieve them I get very very overwhelmed. I am wanting to lose 20+kgs, and I acknowledge that this will be a slow and steady progress, likely over 12-24+ months of consistency. I am also wanting to create strength and stamina within my body. I have 2 very active little nieces that I would love to be able to pick up and hold for extended periods of time and run around with without getting puffed really easily. 

I eat relatively healthy, with a focus on whole foods (I am also experimenting with calorie counting but I often forget); my town doesn't have mainstream takeaways like Maccas so I don't really eat them - maybe once every 2 months or so? I do have a big sweet tooth but I try limit it to once a week when I have a town day and I go out for a coffee with friends. 

I try to get my daily steps in, I aim for around 6000 steps as that's easily doable in an hour for me but on days that I don't go for a dedicated walk I average around 3000steps. 

It's also worth noting that I have Endometriosis and PCOS so I am Insulin Resistant, which makes it harder to lose weight - I have heard that for Endo weight loss you need a mixed bag of healthy hormone diet + steps + strength training, so I'm specifically looking for help creating a weekly workout plan to help me achieve my goals.

As follows and more than happy to connect via comments or PM:

Kauai:

5 Days. We stayed at Koa Kea in Poupu and couldn’t recommend it more. It was absolutely gorgeous and the staff and amenities were fantastic. 

-Go see the Turtles 🐢 Beaching at sunset. Walk to the beach and take a left. Amazing how many there are
-Beachside Luau right near the beach. The hostess, food, dancing, and history was a 10/10. Pay for premium seating to eat first and be closest to the stage
-Hit up Little Fish across the street for coffee and açai bowls. Beware of the chickens 🐔 trying to steal! 
-Drive up and hike at Halele’a. Two miles to the private beach (don’t even put your toes in the water so many people have died in those currents with zero help available) and another ~2 to an incredible waterfall. 
-We did a guided Kayak/Hike up the Wailua River and to another secret waterfall. Was one of our favorite activities 
-Nepali Coast/Niihue Boat toar and snorkel. Holy shit was this beautiful and fun. We snorkled right off the coast of Niihue and saw highly endangered Monk Seals in the water and amazing fish. 

Big Island:

-Started off staying at Volcano 🌋 Villange near VNP. Our little hut 🛖 <literally looked just like that emoji, was so perfect. Volcanoes National was my favorite of the many NP’s we’ve been, it feels like you’re on Mars and is an otherworldly experience. You go from The Jungle Book to being on Mars in the middle of a crater in minutes. We didn’t even see Lava, and it blew us away. 
-After two days near VNP, we took an entire day to drive around the Big Island from VNP to Kona and spontaneously stopped on the way. So many amazing places, one out of favorites was the Waipio Lookout and Waipio fruit shack to get exotic Hawaiian fruit
-we then spent the remainder of our time at Lava Lava Beach Club. Holy shit was this cool. You open your door and are on the beach, have a restaurant steps away, an outdoor shower, and are about ~30 min from Kona. 
-IF YOU DO ANYTHING ON BIG ISLAND OR TAKE A SINGLE THING FROM THIS POST: NIGHT SNORKEL WITH MANTA RAYS. THIS WAS A LIFE CHANGING NATURE EXPERIENCE YOU CANT DO HARDLY ANYWHERE ON EARTH. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO THIS. I recommend Sea Paradise Adventures. The boat, crew, and experience was 10/10. 
-We also went deep sea fishing. Had a marlin on the hook :(!!!! But was so fun regardless. 
-We ended our trip with stargazing on Mauna Kea, the world’s tallest volcano. If you’re into stars and questioning what life is… please do this. Unless you’ve been somewhere similar, you’ve truly never seen the stars in your life. Mauna Kea is renowned for this globally and many countries have telescopes and scientific domes on the summit specifically for its astrological perfection. We just drove to the visitors center in our car, but tours are offered. It’s worth the ~hour drive from Kona once the sun goes down

There’s about 101 other little things we did that I didn’t mention but those were the biggest. Embrace the “aloha lifestyle” when you go and enjoy every moment. Leave your phones, work, and life’s problems behind. We are planning our next trip already. 

My last piece of advice… I am one who was taught and agreed with never getting the protection on rental cars. If you plan to drive to trailheads and anywhere off the main roads, I would recommend it. Flat tires are no fun at 11pm at night in a remote bay after manta ray snorkeling :)

I had my first longer trip in my Lightning since buying it last March. I live in Montana and the temps are starting to drop and there was significant snowfall during my return trip. 

Montana is relatively sparse for EV charging. Although we have several Tesla stations along the interstate, at least half for this trip are for Tesla only. Regardless, I bought the Lectron adapter as I haven’t received my Ford one yet as a “just in case”. I will now be returning the Lectron as I don’t need it. I was able to use an Elecrify America Ultra Fast charger that was great. For the return, I charged much more than I needed due to road conditions and the temperature, just to be safe. I charged to 83%, but made it home with 40% remaining

To Destination:
-Preconditioned with departure time
-100% departure SOC
-68 degree cabin temp. Turned it off often as I was being overly conservative. Could have left it on. Really used it just to defog. The cabin is incredibly well insulated. 
-28 degree avg external temp
-Clear roads
-Seat heater at max. No steering wheel heater as I was Blue Cruisin’
-75mph avg speed 
-2588 ft elevation gain overall
-140 miles
-1.7 mi/kwh avg
-Arrived at 41%

Return:
-Major snowstorm overnight and at departure time. 
-Outdoor temp 19 degrees. Terrible road conditions…but I was excited about it!
-40 minutes to charge up to 83% at EA  charger. Worked great!  Seamless and free with my Blue Oval network credit. Walked and grabbed a coffee and Christmas gift at the nearby Target while I waited. 
-preheated cabin off plug, then used the Ford Public Charging app to pre-heat battery on my way to the DC fast charger. 
-kept cabin at 68-69 full-time. Seat heater on 2, heated steering wheel, rear defrost on several times. 
-averaged around 45-50mph during to road conditions. This was a steady downhill return trip
-2.4 mi/kwh
-Arrived at 40%

Gents…this truck is a BEAST!  I have factory tires and it gripped the road (ok, the snow) better than any vehicle I’ve owned before. I was comfortable, felt safe, and frankly enjoyed what would have normally been a white knuckle drive. All my fears of range anxiety and winter degradation are gone. I was overly cautious, and will be in the future too, but this was altogether a great experience. I have received plenty of “well what about when winter hits” or “have fun heading to the mountains and running out of juice”, blah, blah, blah comments in the last..

Apple Maps is great with the estimated SOC at arrival and it was conservative both times. 

My overall review: 10/10. This truck is fantastic in the winter.

So, I can be a dick. That's pretty well established.

When I offered up the answer to the HR lady’s- the one with the tired arms from reaching so deeply into her bag of corporate cliches and the tired ears from having to listen to my three thousand “ex wife is a whore” jokes- query as to what my ex-wife’s motto was, and I first spoke it in the Latin, I was bein’ all cocksure, dickishly fucking clever me, right?

Yup, I’m overqualified, you really nice people who have been nothing but really nice to me. I’m better than you, I know more languages than you...and by that I mean I know one, English, because, really? Brang? Brung? Depthness? Muchly? And those are just the one that stick out in my head. Nice people who are probably all the fuck up in arms right now about brown people not “speakin’ English good” because of the fucking racist, losers you assholes went and elected speaking anything but fucking English when they used those words.

Namaste.

Ohm. Volt. Ampere.

Anyone? Fucking idiots.

Okay, so I’m bein’ all dickishly, cleverly so much fucking better than the nicest fucking people on the planet, right? Now, there were a tonne of really pretty girls in that orientation. Small town America? Whatever you are putting in the bullshit, sugary cereals you dumbasses feed your daughters? Add even more because holy shit, that was a corporate cliché-filled orientation I recall with much fondness on the nights my girl doesn’t hate her father enough to get over the disgust she registers about letting some old ex-con help her work her way past whatever the fuck it was he said or did to make her hate him just the right amount to fall for me.

Because I was being dickishly clever and because there had already been a decent amount of interest shown in the guy from the big city with all the big city words and the big city ideas and the big city total lack of a fucking brain-mouth filter, I was maybe struttin’ a little by then, okay? I mean, fuck, half the guys in this orientation had never been anywhere outside of Pennsylvania unless it was that big trip up to Waverly, New York to see the tractor pullin’ every harvest moon.

Now, Jamie Steele is there, and she’s not lookin’ like she’s enjoyin’ bein’ up in front of all of these cowpokin’ asshats and, if I’m bein’ fair, she’s probably not too stoked about bein’ up in front of the dick who’s makin’ all of the dick-like remarks about a woman he once promised to “honor and to cherish”. In my defense, it does no dishonor to any person to have their foibles gently picked upon. Further, I contend it does to dishonor to speak of a person their actions.

Ergo, my ex-wife bein’ the kind of gal to fuck some dude I let live in the home I bought for her because he was down on his luck and she asked me to getting’ picked upon ever so gently? Maybe it was fair game. I don’t know, you be the judge on that one. I end up serving the country, he ends up fucking my wife while I’m doing that…which seems as though a perfectly fair thing to happen, right? I mean, what the fuck kinda asshole am I doing what I’m supposed to, anyway? Fuck me.

So, there’s poor, incredibly beautiful Jamie, and she’s getting eye fucked in a way that would embarrass the sorts of girls I nightly find on Xhamster and YouPorn when my gal is going through a good patch with her memories of her father. I am not engaged in this. It’s not the way I was raised, neither of my wives were the sorts of trash who would accept a man who did such a thing as a mate, and there was this really pretty blonde sitting next to me who just so happened to keep “accidentally” brushing my hand and making eye contact with me. The one who spat our the milk, remember?

Now, let me just stop you all right the fuck in your idiot tracks, okay? Just because the pretty blonde was accidentally brushing my hand does not mean that I was eye fucking her, either. No, that’s not something I generally do because it’s fucking creepy as shit to do...from that distance. There was already this thing called “the internet” in 2008, so I had no reason to eye fuck this pretty blonde. If she and I maybe one day happened to get cozy somewhere that would be the time and the place for me to eye fuck every portion of her as I slowly undressed her, and then went all cuckoo bird up in my head and fucking recited Balzac to her or something. Yes, Balzac, you fucking trash. Go ahead and chuckle you uninformed, uneducated cancelers of my educated and informed vote.

Oh my G-d, let me opine on that for a second. If votes counted by the fucking amount of thought put into them, Jesus Christ this country would be such a better place. Nope, fuckheads like you get to vote, too. Derp! Guns. Derp! Cheap dick sucking whore gasoline that doesn’t even work out when bad internet man use big explain word. Derp! Bible.

Holy fuck I hate so many of you. Just fucking eat a plate of rat poison and broken glass you fucking idiots. I mean, I don’t give a fuck that you all will starve to death in a few months. You know what I care about? I have to fucking step over all of your bodies and the keys on my computer that make up the sentence, “See? I told you that you were fucking dumb as dogshit” are gonna need to be replaced and I really like this keyboard.

Did you know that when you are a serious author that you can actually custom order keyboards with the key firmness custom set? Like a fucking trigger pull on a pistol or rifle? That is so fucking tight. They sent this fucking thing to me, for free, just to one day fucking talk about. Tight! It’s set to super, duper fucking heavy keystrokes because you fuckers make me slam keys so goddamned hard when you fucking cancel out my educated and informed vote with guns and Bible bullshit that I’ve actually broken keys before. That’s how much you people suck dick in the same ways as your dick sucking whore mothers do. You make me do these abusive things. Get used to hearing shit like that in 2025. That’s gonna be a straight up, legit legal defense again. The woman made me hit her.

Fucking brilliant job, people.

So, I’m struttin’ my big city words and my big city knowledge and my big city life, one where, you know, maybe I’ve been farther away from Mehoopany, Pennsylvania than the big tractor pullin’ fair yon up Waverly way. There’s Jamie, lookin’ like she’s just about done bein’ mentally bent over the desk in the front and I issue forth my brilliant goddamned quip about the motto of an ex-wife who takes about as much dick in the bed that’s in the house I bought for her as your fucking dick sucking whores of mothers do in the Port Authority Bus Terminal’s Men’s Room.

Christ...the formula is not working. You people are just so fucking stupid.

Okay, Jamie’s standing there, and she looks good in just about anything, okay? This girl could own a burlap sack in the same way most girls you know own that little, black dress that they had to buy for themselves because their “men” spent all of the money they “earned” in their SSD payout on their fucking boy-caves. This girl was, stunning.

Radiant, in the truest form of that word. Every time I saw Jamie Steele walk into a room, and we worked in a consumer paper goods factory, that room lit the fuck up and got the fuck better by about a billion fucking shades each. If she walked past me, the pathway she was upon shone better for her. If she walked in front of me, well, let’s just say that she was one of those girls that knew precisely how far was far enough and how far was too far in wigglin’ it left, then thristin’ it back right again. She wasn’t an hourglass figure, but she was a girl like none other, in so many ways, and I’m not just talkin’ looks, people, this was a special, special person.

She’s standin’ there, tired of bein’ mentally fucked in each and every way by pretty much everyone who had a sex drive in the room. I think even the HR lady might have stuck her tired ass finger down the front of her tired ass panties when Jamie wasn’t lookin’. This girl put the bop in the bop shoo bop shoo bop and the ram in the fucking ram a lama ding dong, okay?

Fuck you. I’m old, I’m a choir geek, and each and every last one of you can suck my cock, you fuckin’ uncultured, classless pieces of white trash, Walmart shoppin’, trailer parkin’, tractor pullin’, cow fuckin’ dogshit.

I offer my quip. Go me. I’m better than all of you nice people.

My eyes to Jamie, gotta impress the prettiest one with what a clever dick, a better sort of dick, I was than whoever the fuck she was used to pity fuckin’ down the pond or up the barn or in the fucking silo or I don’t fucking know what you red state people consider a romantic place to make love, okay? I figure it has something to do with one of those old El Caminos on your lawn or a zero turn mower or something-I seriously don’t know. Judging by the shit you losers talk about it’s most likely someplace with either a Bible, a gun, a fucking zero turn mower, an ATV, or a fucking flag with some bleeding rapist on it. I don’t know, maybe the more of those elements you throw in the better? Maybe one bleeding rapist flag equals two zero turn mowers. I just don’t know. I just don’t want to fucking know. I know where I like to make love to my women first, okay? That’s a little private place that none of you will ever fucking know about because, honestly? There’s maybe one or two of you I’d consider up to my level and the rest would take so much fucking liquor to even be up to what I’d consider, like, a 4 or a 5? Well, fuck, I need you kinda up near an 8 or a 9, okay? I cannot drink that fucking much to get you where I need you to be. Not an insult, just...go look in the mirrors and be honest, okay?

I’m honest with me when I look at me. I’m not all that. I just have panache, charisma, a good life story and the ability to tell it, a good job, and I treat ladies like people rather than property. That last one. Holy shit, I cannot tell you how important that is to a girl allowing me to learn that she hates her father, okay? People. Girls are people. They have feelings and ideas, too. I know. Those two Americas all of the angry blond(e) “news” people are always yelling at you about, right?

Girl = Person  
Ladies = People

Holy fuck. That’s why math is scary to red state people.

And, yeah, you all can go fuck your zero turn mowers or whatever, I use old school terms for dames. Fuckheads, I rob banks. I’m supposed to. It’s the law, okay? I have to do that. I rob banks, I write books, that drops panties, then we “talk” about daddy issues.

Fuck. You people are such idiots.

I offer the quip, my eyes shoot to Jamie to see how the super pretty girl with the “it” goin’ on that is just so right the fuck up my alley.

Her eyes? They narrow.

This? Not an uncommon reaction to hearing Latin in the middle of some shitheap town in the middle of a shitheap state in what is now a shitheap nation. Not a lot of people outside of the Ivory Towers of that scary place that your angry blond(e) “news” people call “liberal academia” and that I call “the place where smart people who will soon know what the fuck they are talking about go to learn what the fuck they are talking about so you can ignore them because zero turn mower rape flag gun”. Fuck, I hate you people.

Her eyes? Dart back and forth.

This? Not at all a common reaction.

What the fuck is this girl do- Oooohhhh….she’s working through the way I so dickishly, cleverly twisted around those words? What? This is Mehoopany fucking Pennsyltucky. What the fuck? Where the fuck did that girl from Line Supply D Team pick up enough fuc-

Her eyes? They flash.

People, if the blues of her eyes make the Pacific Ocean fucking weep with jealousy, the whites of her eyes do something even more to a fresh snowfall upon the highest reaches of the Swiss Alps. I’ve never seen anything so stark, the delineation between the Pacific Ocean blues of her eyes and the Alpine white of those portions surrounding them.

Had there been more light in the room, they may well have shot a actual beam into me in the way they had just done metaphorically. I was transfixed. Her eyes’ whites said to me, “I’m not a small town girl and I hate being here in this small town place I’m from. I know more than these people and all they see are these blue eyes as these boobs and these hips and these legs.”

Jamie Steele, not some forklift drivin’ country gal from Line Supply D Team, no, no, no, no, no. Jamie Steele was a girl too goddamned good to be stuck in such a place, and the whites of her eyes surrounding the Pacific Ocean blue that liars and real men alike remembered told me that she had just quickly worked her way through the twisted Latin I so dickishly, cleverly, better-than-you-nice-peoplely threw the fuck out there to score cheap points on a girl I had once promised to “honor and to cherish”.

She got the joke.

Now, all of this? Maybe two seconds, on the top end. It’s incredible what can occur in two seconds, isn’t it? Anyone remember 8:02 on 9/11/2001? Anyone remember that first time your one true love walked past you? Anyone remember that moment before a first kiss and then the first moment beyond it, after your lips had met?

Jamie Steele and two seconds. That was all it took for me to know that this was a special person. I mean, yeah, everyone is special in some way, and, for once, I’m not being a dick here and somehow gonna swing it back around on you. Holy shit, people. Do you not understand how fucking special each and every goddamned one of you are? If not to anyone else than to me? And...honestly? Who better to be special to than a smart person who is your better in so many ways?

See? I’m just playin’ there. Seriously. Holy fuck, I have talent, okay? I can learn things quickly and I can write better than people who are far more successful than I am...and I am nothing compared to what some of you have to offer. I can write, fly planes, drive heavy trucks, shoot better than anyone you know...and all of those sound really interested (except the truck thing, I think) but they are fucking nothing compared to some of the talents I am just so certain I heard in the voices I don’t get to hear anymore and in the eyes I don’t get to see anymore.

Jesus fuck, people. If I can pick myself the fuck up from where I was two years ago and find myself here...what the fuck are you all waiting for? This is such a blessed age for creative people. The bar to entry is so fucking low that even the dumbest fuckers on the planet are making millions creating and not one of you strikes me as a dumb fucker, okay? I know I say that, but, again, that’s my liberal paternalism. You’re human so, yes, you suck at making good choices. You need smarter people so you don’t do things like boil the fucking planet your leave your starved to death bodies littering, okay? You suck at things like not boiling your planet your death. You suck at caring more for children than you do for the guns you don’t need or know how to use properly. You suck at the serious stuff but you fucking rock at all the bullshit that common people should care about, okay?

If the world were made up of people who cared as much as I did about everything? Holy fuck, there’d be nothing like “fun” occurring, okay? I care too much about too many goddamned things...and it has fucking ruined me in so many ways. I swear to G-d this sounds like a dig but it so fucking isn’t.

Leave the serious people shit to the serious people who read, okay? You all go and do all the bullshit that makes our shitty, fucking miserable existences fucking livable, okay? When an economist tells you that if you vote for some idiot who is going to stick you with tariffs (because that’s how they work, fuckwads, you pay them -not China or Mexico- didn’t fucking know that, did you?) that you will basically fucking eat up all of that $2.00/gallon gasoline money you saved and then some? Fucking listen. When people like me tell you that if you take 20,000,000 workers out of an economy that is already many millions of workers short that you will starve yourselves to death? Listen. When a woman tells you that if you vote for some fucking rapist that the next time she (or your mother, wife, sister, or daughter) has a pregnancy complication that she might fucking die...fucking just listen.

Working in a mass production factory is the sort of thing even you fucking idiots could succeed at. Hey, the shit you’re doing on Day 1? Look three years down the road, okay? That’s pretty much the same fucking shit you’re gonna be doing then. For me? For an autistic guy who likes time to think? For a guy who is fucking fine tuned by G-d Almighty to find the most efficient ways to perform tasks and then perform those tasks in that manner every goddamned time he does? Fucking wonderful job.

Was it tedious? No. Was it monotonous? Yes.

Learn the fucking difference between those words, people. I really don’t want to talk about how your mother’s dick sucking as a dick sucking whore is monotonous but never tedious, okay? You get the point, you are from the shallow end of a gene pool that looks like the dry one by the no tell up 46 out Clifton ways that she has those romantic, meth smokin’ nights in with that fucker who shoulda stuck around to smack you on the tush more than a few times to teach you ladies not to accept shit treatment and you boys not to offer it up in such ample sums to the ladies.

My job? Actually, really fun, all things considered. I drove a forklift that makes a Volkswagen look really small by comparison and did so flying back and forth across the largest paper factory on the fucking planet at a rate of speed that would make the fucking morons I had to dodge flee in fucking terror when they knew the fucking crazy ass, former Marine guy was assigned their paper machine.

But, you know what? Never 1 minute of fucking machine downtime assigned to lack of the giant fucking 4 tonne marshmallows of fucking paper I had to deliver not bein’ there on time. I used to get them there before they’d lifted the last rolls into place and then I’d have to go apeshit about ordering rolls when they hadn’t lifted the old ones yet because, Jesus Christ, didn’t they know that the crazy-ass former fucking Marine Corps guy who actually worked instead of fucking hanging around and playing on his phone or disappearing and sleeping was on?

It was actually not a very long pathway I had to tread before I had people who worked the various machines asking for me to be assigned to supplying theirs. Of course, because I was proving day in and day out that, no, there really weren’t any good excuses for not showing up on time, every goddamned time, with the fucking giant marshmallows of paper, I maybe upset more than a few people in Line Supply, but you know what? You are collecting a paycheck, do your fucking job. If you’re not, and let’s not fucking obfuscate here, people, if you are not working and you are supposed to be and you are collecting pay for not doing the work someone is paying you to do, you are every bit as goddamned guilty of thievery as I was in that fucking bank and you go right the fuck ahead and split hairs about guns and drugs and suck my dick, okay?

To take something you are not deserved is to steal that something.

Eat dicks if you think otherwise.

Do you deserve jailtime like I got (most deservedly\* so)? Fuck no. I introduced into thievery the real peril of loaded firearms in the hands of dangerously depressed people.

Are you still a fucking thief when you take money for work you are not doing? Fuck yes.

Go ahead and hire a contractor to work on your house, pay him, and then have him not do the fucking work and see what you think about him.

Eat a dick if you are gonna lie to yourself.

If you have a job and you are paid to do it...fucking do it.

If you do not like the amount you are paid to do that job, ask for more. If you do not ask for more, that is on you, fuck you, do the job for the amount you did agree to work for.

If you do not like your job or your boss, go on this new “interweb” thing and find any one of the ten million fucking jobs that are out there and fucking apply for one of them. Until you get that new job, though, fucking do the job that someone is paying you to do.

Christ, you people and your stupid, sniffle free fucking long ass vacations from work.

There’s a really interesting cast of characters that goes along with this and even one or two stories that go along with some of them, too. As I’m just over 21,000 characters and as I’m not getting bad pains in my wrists yet? Why don’t I introduce you to them.

There was, of course, Jamie. I’ll color her in more through the telling of the story. The girl was pure fucking magic, though. If I had to kill any dozen of you to allow her to smile just once, I’d likely do that...and not because you aren’t wonderful people who aren’t deserving of life. No, quite the opposite, in fact. Her smile is that fucking crooked ass wonderful, okay? If she lights up a room with her presence, her smile lights up the goddamned dark side of the moon, okay?

There was Pam. Now, I could never really figure out if Pan was just married and happened to be a lesbian who didn’t know she was a lesbian or if she and her husband had an arrangement or if I was (and am) just being kind of a dick and totally misreading the way she was around the pretty (and other) girls. I think she was a lesbian. Nothing wrong with that. Great lady with an infectious laugh who fucking loved my oddball sense of humor.

Pam was goin’ on about Monopoly once and how she was just fucking Queen of the Monopoly board and blah blah blah. Now, I want to tell you a thing or two about playing Monopoly with me. If you have never had another person develop your property for you in return for half the fucking rent money you collect on said property? If you’ve never gone into development agreements and been offered free rent on the full color group in return for the one property I need from you to make a Monopoly? You people are fucking amateurs and it’s no wonder you didn’t butt fuck the economy into a position of starving yourselves into eating rivers of the $2.00/gallon gas that the economic depression your hatred of brown people didn’t cause you to not butt fuck the economy into allowing that will hopefully suffice for all the rotting foodstuffs left in the fields.

Seriously. You people have no idea how to play Monopoly if you haven’t studied real estate development practices.

Pam was goin’ on about this and she asked me if I played Monopoly. I told her that it was a game about money and real estate and that I was Jewish and, this being the case, her question was the dumbest fucking one I’d heard all week.

Pam was a great lady who maybe didn’t know she was a lesbian or not or who the fuck cares? I fucking love her and if she shows up now and says that since she’s figured out the thing that no one should fucking care about but also found out that over half the fucking country now wants to burn her at the stake and asks me to kindly go shoot some of those people in the fucking head for her?

Yup. I’d do that for Pam.

Uh, there was Stacy Blain.

Jesus, poor Stacy Blain. Stacy Blain was Eeyor, from Whinny the Pooh, in human-girl form. A sweet girl, but dumb like a box of rocks and slow as molasses, too, even in her speech pattern. But she was such a good human being. I love Stacy and her slow ass, long ass, stupid ass questions and the stupid fucking words she thought were words and the fucking fact that she was kind and decent and wouldn’t harm a fucking fly.

If Stacy Blain showed up on my fucking door and said that Christopher Robbins was in trouble and that she needed me to go shoot some fuckers who hated weak, effete, kinda girly little boys in the head, you know I’d fucking do that for her, too, because those sorts of assholes made my life hell and they cause weak, effete, little boys who are maybe a little girly to go ahead and waste their lives trying to be people they aren’t (in the best case scenario) and fucking kill themselves from feelings of inadequacy (in the worst case).

So, yeah, slow ass Stacy Blain? I love her and I’d fucking murder bullying assholes for her, too.

Derek Schizer...you know it’s really hard to find nice things to say about Derek because he just used girls but, honestly, the sorts of girls who’d fall for his routine? Maybe they were lookin’ to get taken, you know? He was a clown and kind of a dick, but, too, he was also just a young guy livin’ life, being a fool, and he never did me any harm. He actually paid me a bunch of really high compliments when I schooled the super qualified technical people one a few things in a little class we had to take where they got a bunch of their own shit wrong. I mean, yeah, maybe usin’ girls is kinda somethin’ I’m really against, and all, but again, he was super transparent about bein’ the sort of guy who was only usin’ girls and the girls just kept goin’ for it anyway, so I’m not very critical of him, in all honesty.

If Derek Schizer showed up to my door and told me that there was some girl who hated her father that he wanted to take out but that her father hating girlfriend needed a date to and that he wanted me to be his wingman? I’d take one for the team, and I’d go discuss these issues with the young lady, you know, because I’m a really nice guy like that. I care about people. I give too much of me, okay?

Sarah Weiss, holy out to here with the tits. And her face? Not bad. Her body? Nothing to complain about there, neither. Sweet like honey, innocent as all shit, but could teach this fucking girly ass guy a thing or two about the fucking carburetor atop the V-8 on his old Chevy. She was a small town girl next door in every way. She had stories every day about stickin’ her whole arm up this hole or that hole on this farm animal or that farm animal and pulling whatever the fuck was in that hole right the fuck out.

Sarah and I had a playfully flirtatious relationship, but it wasn’t anything in any way serious. She knew why guys looked at her...I mean, Jesus Christ, how could she not? Like, those old torpedo tits from the early 1940s movies? Those were hers..with no fucking bra under ‘em. They defied fucking gravity and they just might have qualified as the eighth and ninth wonders of the fucking world and Jesus Holy G-d Almighty the lucky motherfucker who got to rest his weary head on those.

Oddly, for a girl who would, without gloves, pull impacted shit from a horse’s intestinal tract? She was oddly squeamish about spiders. Being the guy who loves pullin’ pigtails on the pretty ones, I go and find every terrible fact about spiders I can find on that interweb everyone was talkin’ about back then and have them on hand to work into conversation, kinda real fluid like, you know?

“Oh my G-d, if I ever thought a spider had even been on my food, I would never eat it. It might have laid eggs in it or something and then there’d be, like, little spiders growing in me and…”

“Did you know that the average human swallows 3 spiders every year in their sleep, Sarah?”

“Why would you- Are you- Aaron, why- Oh my G-d, I think I’m gonna vomit-”

(chuckles at the pulled pigtails)

You see, when you have the reputation as being the one who knows fucking every goddamned thing about every goddamned thing (except carburetors), when you speak, people might get pissed that you know every goddamned thing about every goddamned thing (except carburetors) but they listen.

That fact? About the ingesting of spiders? All true...I think. I read it on the interweb somewhere, probably from the sorts of fucking places you idiots read about “15 Most Cringeworthy Photos of Celebs’ Kids Ever” or however the fuck it is you waste that bullshit time that is your “life”.

If Sarah Weiss showed up to my house and said that someone had done something or said something ungentlemanly towards her? Yo, I would rest my weary on those puppies (with permission) and then go shoot that sexist and disrespectful of her fine, feminine form bastard in the fucking head.

Pete Stone. Holy fuck. If rent-a-cops have a hero, it’s Pete Stone. Pete was a Fish and Game Officer. Out here? In Pennsylvania? It’s the easiest way to carry a gun and a badge and have something like authority. So, every asshat on the planet, including Pete, ended up as a Fish and Game Officer. I mean, it’s not like the guy didn’t have some really endearing qualities, he took the time to explain to me how the Commonwealth was attempting to reintroduce Shad (it’s a fish, you fucking idiots) into the Susquehanna and he really wasn’t, like, a dick or anything, but you didn’t ever want to be assigned to a job when Pete was your coworker, because it was then our job and Pete would occasionally show up between the ten million other things Pete would find to do aside from his job.

He could be funny. I’ll give him that. But, if you ever looked down between the rows of the giant marshmallows in search of someone, that person would be Pete...and you’d find him there, playing on his fucking phone. You losers? He walked so you could run, okay? He blazed the fucking trails of workplace laziness so that you could fucking turn it into the goddamned fine art form that you have. You each should send him a fucking thank you emoji or something for being able to do goddamned nothing all day, every goddamned day, and get paid for it. Pete? He was more than a decade ahead of you. He ate all of the shit that you people don’t have to eat. Getting yelled at for not working. Getting in trouble for fucking around instead of bringing giant marshmallows to the line. He did that, for you.

He deserves a fucking statue, assholes. Each of you ought to, at the very fucking least, give the dude a fucking handjob, okay? He did all of that, he absorbed all of that nonsense about “working to get paid” so you don’t have to. You are such ungrateful pieces of shit, you know that?

If Pete Stone showed up to my front door and said that each of you deserve to be smacked firmly (just once) across your pantied backsides for not conferring unto him the forms of praise due unto him for having sacrificed so much so that you could do so very fucking little each day?

I would do that. Maybe even more than just once.

That’s the kinda guy I am.

*Okay, so from here on I’m gonna go ahead and prove I’m a good sport, and one typing with a thumb and a forefinger either on my left earlobe or on my left tit, these belonging to a very angry girl who will neither silence my voice nor edit me, but who will make me eat more than my fair of her nice places, to make up for all of the “daddy issues” stuff that I swear to G-d someone hacked my computer and wrote because that is so not the sort of thing anyone like me would ever write about the sort of classy, beautiful, fogiving girl that she is.*

There was Dave S. I don’t recall his last name as there were two guys named “Dave” on the shift and we just called one “Dave S” and the other “Dave D”. Dave S was a good, small town kinda guy who was a church goin’, G-d fearin’ guy back before that meant that he had to beat up gay people and accuse trans people of trying to convert your children to the transgender identity lifestyle. He and I got along pretty well, but he was quiet, I was quiet, so even when we were working together, the few words that were spent tended to be either towards the job or towards our shared interests in firearms.

This was way before gun culture had overrun the entire fucking red portions of that map that shows you pretty clearly where dickheads live and where pussies live, so the fact that I didn’t want to stick a pistol in my mouth and a long rifle up my ass and work them both wasn’t an issue to Dave S, who kinda did. I love the technical minutiae of firearms, their specifications, performance parameters, designs, the very sorts of shit you’d expect of a United States Marine Corps veteran who also happened to be autistic. I kept offering to show him how to shoot better, but he never took me up on the offer and this fact kinda plays into things later, but he was never a dick to anyone. A good, small town kinda guy who would probably enjoy chopping wood with Dean and I and who would probably enjoy Dean’s daughter not having daddy issues.

*I just had my left earlobe basically ripped off because apparently I was unclear of the rules. Now? I am clear.*

If Dave S. showed up at my front door and told me that his daughter was being forced to undergo a sex-change operation because of some crossdressing, shapeshifting space alien liberal? I would not be fucking surprised in the least, and I would shoot no one, choosing instead to maybe shove a firehose that was connected to a pharmacological factory down his fucking throat and turn it up to full blast.

Dave D. What is there to say about Dave D that couldn’t be said about a single slice of American Cheese sandwich on two Slices of Wonderbread? This was just a normal person, in every regard. I’m willing to bet he drove 4 cylinder Ford Taurus, blue, and that he had a very sensible 20 year, fixed rate mortgage on his home, one he shared with his wife and 2.2 children. I can hardly remember what the man looked like because, honestly? He was just that sort of guy. He neither wanted nor caused any drama.

If Dave D. showed up to my door and asked for a 2% milk? I would hand it to him and ask him why he decided on living such a high risk lifestyle.

Dan. Holy fuck. Every fucking crew needs the sexual deviant D&D guy, right? We pretty well had “sexual deviant” covered already before I got there because of Dan. This dude had the sickest fucking jokes I have ever heard about the phenomenon of human-on-human or human-on-other-species sexual interactions and I’m nearly certain he’d only ever had one of those forms of interactions, you know? Funny as the fucking day is long Dan, okay? He looked the part, too. Those fucking losers in your local park, fucking LARPing and pretending that they’d not piss their fucking pants the very fucking second a zombie apocalypse happened or a human girl talked to them? They are all related, by blood, to Dan.

I love Dan, okay? I don’t want any of this to say “I don’t love Dan” because I love Dan. That dude taught me things about sexually perverse activities that even the internet shuns as being too risque, okay? And any person who can do that for a person like me has seen some shit, okay? Like, literally. He has seen some shit. Maybe masturbated with some shit, too, I honestly don’t want to think about because I just had those electrical flashes when I was trying to sleep as my girl read my computer (without asking)-

*Nipple twist that time.*

\-but as the sweet, delicate, sexually prim and proper little thing that she is, she was appalled to learn that I had been hacked and that that hacker had written that she was the sort of girl to express her supposed distaste for the absent daddy figure in her life (no pinch?) from the rearwards angle, she woke me up to discuss, ever so gently, how I need to better password protect my writings...so I don’t get hacked again, because that’s what happened. I got hacked and someone wrote that stuff.

Anywho, I don’t want to think about any goddamned thing that Dan ever fucking talked about in regards to sex if I end up with sleep paralysis tonight, okay? That sleep demon thing that is the most fucking terrifying thing on the goddamned planet? Not a fucking rainbow colored cupcake with sprinkles compared to what Dan was into.

If Dan showed up on my doorstep, to this very day, and said he wanted to jerk off while my girl and I worked thro=\]

*See? Now she’s on top of it because she knows I’m enjoying making her angry.*

If Dan showed up and asked for a cup of sugar, I’d gladly give him a cup of sugar, just the sort of thing we have in excess around here because to sweeten our coffee, we just dip my girl’s finger into it.

*Aww, a gentle rub of my ear lobe as if I were a dog. Fucking great, right? This is my life, people.*

Pete. Pete was the far better lookin’, similarly sized David Spade of Line Supply D Team. This fucker was a smart ass and he was a townie, too, so I just knew this poor bastard had gotten his ass kicked in the jock culture bullshit that always has been and always will be small town, red America, okay? He is a very important character in the upcoming pages because he was sharp like a fucking razor with his wit and no fucking dummy. He acted like a fool, but I’m certain that was just his survival mechanism, the very sort of thing even far larger people had to do to get by around the fucking idiots you assholes elevate to gods in the social structures of our anything-but-educational systems.

This fucker had a clever fucking, smart ass remark for every goddamned thing I somehow failed to deliver one and, holy shit, I love(d) having him on the team.

If Pete showed up on my doorstep tonight and told me he wanted to go murder a bunch of jocks who were picking on weak kids? I think I’d try to talk him out of it, okay? Kids are kids and do stupid shit, but I wouldn’t try too hard, okay? Those jocks are gonna grow up to be the fuckheads who beat up their wives and overrun my educated vote with their whole “boil the planet it’s fun to hit girls” votes.

Jimmy. Okay, so low rent lookin’ David Groll. I even asked him about that one day when he really looked like he was about to kill himself because he was going through a bad breakup, his car was busted up, his dog had just died, I mean, the poor bastard was living a country song so I felt like he needed a pick-me-up. Good old future bank robber’s always the sort of guy to offer a homey a pick-me-up.

“Jimmy?”

“What?”

“You know, you kinda look like David Groll, from the Foo Fighters, right?”

“Yeah, you say that I guess some other people, too.”

“Do you feel anywhere near as successful as him?”

You see? I wasn’t always a dick.

If Jimmy showed up on my doorstep tonight and told me that he needed to make his way back home and learn to fly? I would tell him he was the pretender.

Fuck you, I’m old. Go listen to your fucking dubstep or whatever the fuck you kids call techno now, okay?

Snapper Carr. Okay? Props to the parents for coming up with one bad ass fuckin’ name he would never need to fuckin’ change on the CB, ever seek a nickname for, or ever have a girl say without sounding fucking sexy as shit, okay? Snapper fucking Carr? What?

Looked like the guy who played Charles in Charge. Very quiet, polite, small town guy who was our Team Leader. I think it's fair to say he would have preferred if all of the work ethic I demonstrated hadn’t come along with all of the bullshit commentary, too, but I liked Snapper and he never had to look for me to know that I was where I was supposed to be and he never got a fucking call about a conversion line being out of their giant marshmallows when I was assigned to that line.

If Snapper Carr showed up on my doorstep tonight and told me that there was an extra shift needed to be pulled and that I needed to disengage from working though some daddy issues with my

1gz4jje,https://www.reddit.com/r/ask_Bondha/comments/1gz4jje/how_to_stop_feeling_less_guilty_for_not_tipping/,How to stop feeling less guilty for not tipping? ,"I live in the USA and the tipping culture here has gotten out of hand. Everywhere I go, they ask for a tip. I'm already paying well enough for all the services. Some of them are overpriced too but still that's my decision. I know tipping is optional but I somehow still feel very guilty if I don't tip. Mfs have also changed default tipping options to 15% and 18% and you have to go through additional steps to change the percentage.

These are some of the places I've seen where I regularly encounter tipping culture:

1. I go to a restaurant and order a biryani. The waiter just brings it to my table. They don't even serve it here. They just bring it to your table. A minutes worth of task at most. And I'm paying 5-6$ tax on a 35$ bill. For a Minute work
2. I go to the grocery store and they bag my groceries. Tip here again
3. Go to Starbucks or another Cafe and just order a coffee (which is already expensive, but I still indulge). A 1.5$ tip on 7$ coffee
4. Service/fixes in my apartment. I already pay north of 4000$ a month in rent. Anything goes wrong, it can be as small as changing a light bulb, I have to raise a service ticket. They ask for tip for changing a light bulb.
5. Ordering out. Uber eats, door dash, instacart, Walmart+, anything you order. Food or groceries .This is on top of Taxes, CA driver benefits, service charges and other taxes. So for a 30$ order, you're already paying 45$ in total. That's almost 50% charge.  And I'm expected to tip? When you've already charged me for a driver benefit fee? and I am already paying a monthly member subscription fee ?
6. Haircuts. India lo ayite scissors anna vadtaru. Ikkada Trimmer tho taka taka chesestaru. 15-20 mins for my dippa cutting. They already charge 30$ for it and again, expect tip. This is one place I'm forced to Tip because he'll remember me the next time I go and will fuck up an already fucked up haircut.
7. Cabs, Uber and Lyft. These ride services have gotten insanely expensive. I mostly don't tip for cab services and I don't even feel guilty here
8. Any fastfood or takeout places or drive thrus. This is not like restaurants where you're seated in and the waiter is getting your food to the table. This is them asking a tip just for making your order. Isn't that what the menu prices and taxes are for? WTH!

I could go on and on but it has gotten insane and out of control. I want to harden my heart and want to stop tipping. I still feel guilty though and want to ask everyone here how do I overcome this guilt and shame?",4,1732490306.0,ask_Bondha,14,0.7,False

1gz4duu,https://www.reddit.com/r/JamesHoffmann/comments/1gz4duu/cupone_vs_ninja_cm104/,Cup-One vs Ninja CM104,"So let me start by saying that i've only recently started my ""coffee journey"" earlier this year with the purchase of the ode 2 during prime day, and let me just say, thanks to the ode 2, i've noticed that im now drinking coffee more so because i enjoy it as a beverage as opposed to a ""pick me up."" That was really nice experience to realize. So with that said, i wouldn't say i am able to tell the difference b/w bad or good coffee unless its blatantly obvious stuff like super bitter or very acidic. so sorry in advanced for the long post!

so let me lay out the stuff im using:

* Grinder: Fellow Ode 2
* Brewer: Moccamaster Cup-One, Ninja CM104
* Beans: [Trader Joe's Organic Fair Trade Shade Grown Ethiopian Coffee](https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/organic-fair-trade-shade-grown-ethiopian-coffee-081741)
* ratio: 17.4g of coffee to 10 oz/283.5g water(""rich setting"" in ninja cm104 does 2oz bloom and then 8oz)

So i recently got the Cup-one during amazon's BF sale, i've been waiting for this ever since i got the Ode 2. B/w today and yesterday Ive probably had like 7 cups of coffee trying to dial in the grind size for Cup-one! I ended up with the step before 9, which was the same setting i used for the old Ninja. This morning, i finally decided to do a comparison. and I just can't decide b/c the flavors are surprisingly very different, and i don't know enough about coffee to know what is ""right"" or ""correct."" i guess the simplest observation would be: at 10 oz water, the Ninja seems to brew the beans im using a lot more ""bold"" and ""in your face"" while the cup-one is very ""mellow"" and ""subdued."" So i guess im wondering, how can i tell if the cup-one is being under extracted or actually its just right or if the Ninja is actually the one over extracting? Or maybe I'm just grinding/brewing the beans completely wrong from the start?

I'll try my best to lay out some observations i have b/w the 2 cups I made, maybe someone can point out stuff im missing.

**Cup-One:**

* while the coffee is still ""hot"" the initial flavor while having the actual liquid in the mouth is very subdued and mellow, it lacks the bitterness/boldness i would expect it to have, although it doesn't ""taste like water"" 
* the earthiness comes in more as an after taste, and that's when i get that bold, dark-chocolate taste i'd expect from medium-dark roast
* As the coffee cools down the taste from having the actual liquid becomes more and more subdued but the aftertaste i explained above still remains
* although i don't get acidity, i do start to get it when i set the Ode 2 to 8
* im pretty sure my ratio is .4g more than what moccamaster recommends

**Ninja CM104**

* while the coffee is still ""hot"" the flavor is very ""bold"" and ""in your face,"" it is def bitter, but a good kind of bitter? (im not sure if bitterness is to be expected in medium dark Ethiopian beans?)
* there is no ""after taste"" in the coffee at least like how it was with the coffee brewed with the Cup-One, all the ""flavor"" of the coffee seems to be just that, ""up front""
* as the coffee goes from hot to cool, i noticed some acidity that went away when the coffee reached a cool temperature. 
* the primary flavor becomes bitterness when the coffee has cooled down and still no ""after taste effect""

**some general observations i've had**

* i've had the Ninja for a long time, and first thing i did when i got the Ode 2, was try to do some lighter roast, and i can say the ninja def struggles at medium roast, it's hard to get acidity out
* i brewed the coffee comparisons at the same(as in clicked the brew buttons at the same time) and the Cup-One finished last so i was surprised on the ""lack of flavor"" compared to the Ninja which finished a good 30 sec before the Cup-one
* one thing i haven't tried yet is increasing the amount of coffee with the Cup-One, but i think that would make it hard to compare?

Before I started it I got an ekg which was normal and my blood pressure is normal (even though I’m obese). 

So I started taking it for a few weeks and I can’t tell how well it’s working or not. I keep reading that taking Ritalin with both those increases risks of a lot of things so I don’t know why she put me on it then as opposed to something else?

I have been getting tired earlier and sleeping through the night, but this could be because I also stopped drinking regular coffee and just use decaf. Of course I forget that diet soda has caffeine and I feel like it affects me more with my heart rate and kind of a buzzing feeling etc. I also use a nicotine vape.
I am still tired a lot anyways. 

She told me to not take it one day and see what happens and I didn’t notice anything. Then she tells me in a few days after to take 20mg to see what happens (which I am too anxious about to do)

Should I just keep taking 10mg with no caffeine  or tell her I want to go off of it and use something else? Should I double up one day like she says and see what happens or is that going to kill me?

In the last month she did some very questionable things; we started the gym together and met some people, one of the guys we met messaged her a lot and i told her that i wasn’t comfortable with it, i asked her to stop and then it didn’t go any further, about a week later she went out clubbing with a friend and the guy was also out in the same area, they messaged and he asked her to come and see him, with her friend and she did so, she stayed the night as she was ‘tired’ and told me she slept on the sofa with her friend, this was a lie, she did sleep on the sofa but her friend was with another guy in the bedroom. when i called her out on it the first time, she said she wasn’t sure about us as a couple, she had done this twice before but then said she couldn’t do it, she just doesn’t want to be with me anymore and wanted time to think about what she wanted to do, during this time, someone she used to have a sexual relationship probably saw things were missing on her instragram, photos of me etc, he messaged me her and asked how she and I was, she proceeded to explain she is now single otherwise she wouldn’t have messaged him, i saw this and got visibly upset, after 2 weeks of her not knowing what she wanted to do, me still being there for her and comforting her, she finally made the decision to end it. the day after on her way home to her parents, she saw the person on the way home for a ‘coffee’- of course this is a decision she has been thinking about for a month or two, and when brought to light she cried non stop for a couple of weeks with me as her shoulder to cry on, until making her abrupt decision and leaving me in the dust to care for myself. She has now proceeded to begin moving out, we had so many plans for the future and for a new flat early next year and she’s just gone, I have been with someone else and I got cheated on after 3 years so I know how a heartbreak feels, but this is different, i am so so broken, i dont even know how move on from this, I just have a gut feeling that she really is the one and when things were good they were amazing, and she really did try to help me i just had a lot of stress with jobs and debt (which i have now fixed both of) but this took me nearly 2 years.
it feels like she helped me get out of a hole and now I am out of it, she has had to go, what’s the point in waiting all that time to leave when things are getting better and are going to improve? I’m questioning day to day whether i even want to be alive anymore, i am a real loverboy and she was my world i put everything into her, im so devastated it feels like my heart has been ripped from me and i am really struggling to deal with it. initially happened 3 weeks ago and her final decision was made one week ago, she has been out of our flat since wednesday and doesn’t plan to come back, i just don’t know what to do anymore. i have hobbies and friends but nothing helps at all. Am I stupid? Am I a mug? Am I too in love? Do i need to move on or do i give space and try again in the future? Will her decision ever change? What is the best way to approach this?

1gz48r9,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1gz48r9/not_sure_what_to_do_about_my_new_friendship/,"Not sure what to do about my new ""friendship""","Sorry this is probably long and rambly but a few months ago I met someone really nice at work and I've been wanting to be friends with her. But I have an issue with getting overly excited and attached to people like it's a ""crush"" even if it's purely platonic, and so I have a tendency to overstep my boundaries and just generally being kinda smothering (eg always try to talk to them). What makes things even more complicated is that I'm older (M, ""late-20s/early 30s"" range) and she is college-age. She's also a seasonal staff with unpredictable schedule, while I'm permanent FT, so I'm constantly worrying that I won't see her again and that makes me even more anxious and pushy. And knowing my anxious pushiness makes me even more anxious and worried I'd annoy her and scare her away (rejection sensitivity on max).

We don't actually work in the same department, but we have bumped into each other several times with friendly hellos. I introduced myself back in October and things started nice and friendly with some small talk. I went to sit with her during break one day and had a nice but short conversation, so far so good.

Another day later I went to sit with her during lunch but this time she's very obviously busy studying, I felt bad and left, but after recollecting myself I went back because I don't know when I'll get more opportunities to talk to her in the future. It was super awkward and I just sat there quietly eating lunch beside her, but thankfully it gave me some time before I felt comfortable starting a conversation. It was a lovely chat, but not long after she had to go back to her shift, and in that brief moment when she was leaving I asked if she'd be comfortable exchanging contacts while scrambling to tell her a bunch of gibberish explaining that it's been really difficult making friends with people especially cuz I never know when ppl will suddenly stop having shifts. She was kind enough to exchange numbers with me, but I feel she only did it because she felt bad/pressured.

Anyway, since then I've decided to pull back on initiating convos to give her some space that I'm pretty sure she needs (especially with increasing exam stress). I'm trying to focus back on my own things, but in the back of my mind I'm still kinda anxious about what to do next. I'm super grateful for her contact and that has eased my anxiety a ton. I've asked some folks on reddit and looked up things online and people seem to say it'd be chill to ask ppl out to grab a coffee/lunch to establish friendships and ""what do you have to lose!"", but I dont know... I don't want to just go back to being pushy and make her uncomfortable/annoyed, but also I doubt there will be much ""natural opportunities"" that arise that magically gives us time together to chat and get to know each other. In my experience most acquaintances stay acquaintances, so I feel I'd have to do \*something\* if I want to establish an actual friendship with this person. I could just passively ""see how it goes"" but I'm so darn impatient.

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it’s you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength—I wish I’d had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There’s so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it’s not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian—your mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she’s gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I’ve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I’m certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup’s rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn’t know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you’ll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I’m deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea’s trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, “W-what does this mean?”

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. “Not here, not now. Let’s get home, then we can talk.”

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother’s shrill voice called after them, “Leaving already? You haven’t stayed for lunch.”

Sorin’s jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. “I’d rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.” With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. “Damn it, damn it, damn it.”

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea’s gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

“D-do you… think this could really be true?” Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. “Look, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might’ve signed, we’ll have proof.” He paused, deep in thought. “Dad must have something lying around.” A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. “Why did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could’ve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!”

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. “We… we don’t really know what was going on back then…”

A sob erupted from him. “I loved him so much, Drea. I don’t remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end…”

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another’s embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, “Call Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.”

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn’t rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

“That’s it! That woman is going to pay today. I’ve tolerated her long enough!” He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

“Adrian, no!”

I wasn’t expecting Kaz to speak a few hours later. I thought he was asleep, dozing on Rowan’s shoulder.

I thought they were talking to each other, which I couldn’t allow, but Rowan was asleep, his head bowed, his soft snores sending my heart into my throat. 

I wanted to untie his restraints, or at least loosen them. I wanted to let him shower, bring down fresh clothes from his room.

I even found myself searching for ointment to soothe the markings on his arms.

But helping them was one step closer to feeling empathy, and empathy would get my brother killed. I had known these people for too long, developing relationships and attachments that were never supposed to happen.

Imogen Prairie had a heart of gold, which was her biggest flaw.

She was too naive, immediately trusting me because I was from her classes.

Imogen was a lonely girl, dumped by her parents at the age of sixteen and forced to grow up way too young.

She should have been smart, should have known that I wasn't a good person.

Imogen should have known not to trust everyone and that doing so would get her hurt.

And yet, she welcomed me with a smile, not suspicious in the slightest.

Imogen Prairie was the perfect vessel. The real world would eat her alive.

Charlie Delacroix was the smart, level-headed one. 

The one I was keeping a close eye on. 

I was already mentally considering his vessel as one of three royals. Mom said that's what she was looking for. 

However, as a human, he was too clever, and if given the opportunity, Kaz could easily come up with an escape plan. 

I had to give him points for being the least frustrating out of the three of them, though.

While Imogen sobbed and screamed threats at me, and Rowan tried to channel his inner Houdini to topple the three of them over, Kaz stayed calm and collected, reassuring them with hushed murmurs that everything was going to be okay.

He may have had a cool demeanor, but when the boy did catch my eye, I saw the anger and resentment curled in his lip.

“Why don’t I cook us all a meal?” he suggested, and I couldn't resist a smile when just the mention of home-cooked food jolted Rowan’s head of shaggy brown curls awake.

“I mean, I love pizza, but not four times in a row.” Kaz gestured to his bindings. “If you untie me, I promise, hand on heart, that I won’t try anything.”

“I second that,” Rowan mumbled under his gag. “I can't eat any more fucking garlic bread.”

“It doesn't even matter,” Imogen whispered. “She's going to kill us anyway.”

Rowan sighed, lightly knocking his head against hers. “Well, maybe I want to eat something home-cooked before my heart is ripped out.”

I had been scrolling through my phone, ironically, searching for recipes. 

They were right. I needed actual food, and whatever was in their pantry (a moldy banana, a single slice of bread, and a few dozen condiments) wasn't going to satisfy any of us. 

There was Uber Eats, but again, I don't think any of us wanted takeout.

I stood from my chair, slowly making my way over to the three of them and grabbing my gun from the coffee table.

The weapon had always felt wrong in my hand, like it didn't fit.

I caught Rowan’s eye, who twisted his head, his gaze glued to my gun.

I wasn't expecting his lips to curve into the smallest of smiles under the duct-tape gag, like he knew something I didn't. Kaz didn’t look scared. 

His smile, when I tore off his gag, was genuine, and I hated that despite everything I had done to these kids, somehow they were still trying to be civil.

“I can make us something home-cooked.” His smile broadened. “You need us to stay healthy, right? For when you sacrifice us to your, uhh, your moon Goddess.”

He really was listening. I wasn't delusional.

So he had paid attention when I was talking about how beautiful She was, how they were going to fall for Her too, and how my family wasn't bad—just misunderstood orphans, sons and daughters of the sky. 

I didn't mention my desperation to escape. I had to keep a level head and act exactly like my mother.

I told them of the 100 days and 100 nights of darkness, and the moon’s reign.

Our ancestors, who could shift their flesh into beings of light.

Rowan’s eyes nearly lodged into the back of his head from excessive rolling, while Imogen remained pricklingly silent.

But Kaz? Kaz had listened.

Kaz was ready to accept Her—and sacrifice himself for my brother.

Instead of untying him, though, I cut Rowan’s restraints, yanking him from the chair.

He stumbled when I grasped the scruff of his jacket. “Go upstairs, and get dressed.”

The man's expression turned fearful, but he tried to hide it, masking it with his signature smile. “Jeez, make your mind up. Do you want to tie me up or not?”

“What are you doing to him?” Kaz demanded in a sharp breath, trying to lunge forwards. 

I shrugged. “You said you want to eat actual food.” Keeping my gun trained on Rowan, I grabbed one of his shirts from a pile on the floor, throwing it at him.

“Get dressed,” I instructed, when he just kind of held the shirt in front of him like an idiot.

Rowan did, throwing the shirt on. I noticed his hands were shaking. “Why?, 

“We’re going shopping,” I said, throwing him his coat.

I couldn't resist a smile when it hit him in the face.

“Ow!”

Kaz’s expression crumpled, but he nodded slowly.

“Shopping,” he said with a strangled breath. I wasn't sure he believed me. Maybe Kaz thought shopping was code for, “I'm going to take him away and murder him without you.”

When the boy ducked his head, I slowly made my way over to him, kneeling in front of him. Kaz didn't look at me, avoiding my gaze.

“If you touch him,” he whispered, his voice dropping into a hiss, “I swear to God, I will kill you myself. You said you need all three of us for this fucking sacrifice to work, so don't take him away.”

I pretended not to see the tears in his eyes.

“Please,” his voice turned pleading, “Don't hurt my family.”

I was confused at first, thinking he meant his family back home. 

But then it hit me like a wave of ice-cold water when I caught his frantic gaze glued to Rowan, who seemed weirdly calm about the whole situation. 

These two were his family. He had told me about his biological one—his homophobic father who refused to accept his choices, the people he loved. 

So, Charlie Delacroix had found his own family. I swallowed a lump in my throat.

A family I was part of–until I fucked everything up. 

Kaz was fiercely protective over the two of them, almost animalistic. His bound hands grasped for Imogen, his narrowed eyes never leaving my gun which was pointed at Rowan’s head.

In Mom’s eyes, I was looking at a true vessel for a King. 

Still, his words *stung*. 

“Do you trust me?” I asked, my own voice catching. 

Kaz stared down at the floor. “Just bring him back safe.”

I was going to ask him if he could prepare the kitchen and wash the dishes, but instead, I tightened his restraints. “We won't be long,” I said, slapping another wad of duct-tape over his mouth. 

Kaz didn't look at me, but he *did* ask if I could turn on the TV. Rowan, to my surprise, was actually waiting by the door, playing with his keys. I could see multiple household objects he could attack me with, and yet he chose to stay nonchalant. 

“Hurry up,” Rowan said, playing with his keys. “We can go to the nearest 7/11 and get actual food.” He shot a smile at Kaz and Imogen, who looked equally panicked. 

“Relax!” He told them, side-eyeing my weapon. I noticed he was paying a lot more attention to my gun. 

Still, Rowan Beck was acting again, this time trying (and failing) to convince his friends I wasn't leading him to his death. 

It was a good performance, but the second he stepped from my side, I shoved my gun in his back. 

I caught his expression twisting, the breath leaving his lungs. 

“I'm all good! I'm not planning on running.”

I made sure to lock the other two inside the house, jumping into the passenger seat of Kaz’s car. Rowan took the driver's side with no complaints, shooting me a wide smile. “Do you wanna listen to the radio?”

I said, “No.” but maybe he didn't hear me, immediately flicking it on. 

“So, Nin,” Rowan began, halfway down the road. He was squeezing the steering wheel a little too tight for me to believe his “I’m actually totally fine” facade. He must have thought I was born yesterday. 

I was waiting for him to do something really stupid—like flash SOS with the lights or shout for help—but instead, his eyes strayed on the road ahead. “If that’s even your *real* name.”

“It’s Nini,” I said. 

Rowan cut me off with a snort. “I can’t believe we trusted you.” I noticed he was squeezing the wheel so hard his fingertips were turning white. 

He rolled his eyes. “Dude, I told them there was something wrong with you, but noooo, apparently *I* was the crazy one.”

I focused on training my gun on him. “Sounds like you’re mad at them.""

I caught his sharp glance at my weapon. He was planning something, but I wasn’t sure what. If he tried anything, I would kill him and rip out his heart early—and he knew that. Rowan only had one advantage: the outside world.

“Of course I’m fucking mad at them,” he sighed, cranking the radio up. “They welcomed a goddamn psycho into our house.”

Ouch.

“You’re going to jail, y’know,” he hummed as we reached an intersection. 

I found the soft click, click, click of the indicator oddly soothing. The colorful blur of late-night traffic was comforting. 

Rowan surprised me with a laugh, his tone turning sing-song. “You’re going to jail for a lonnnnnnnnnng fucking time.”

“Shut up.” I didn’t mean to say it, but it was like word barf. 

“What? That you’re going to jail? I can count your felonies on two hands.”

“Stop.” I said. 

“Kidnapping,” Rowan announced. “That’s already, like, a serious fucking crime.”

I couldn’t move—suddenly paralyzed by his words.

“Forced inebriation,” he continued. “You drugged me and took advantage of me.”

“No, I didn’t!” I shrieked, immediately losing my cool.

“But you could have,” Rowan said, his tone turning sour. “You fucked with my head, made me think I actually liked you, and the next thing I know, I’m cuffed to your bed frame—”

“Drive.”

I didn’t realize I was stabbing the barrel of my gun into his stomach until he brushed it away with a sigh. “Do you *want* to attract attention to us?” 

He raised a brow. “Now, I’m no Einstein, but pointing a gun at me is definitely going to get us pulled over.”

He was infuriatingly right. I stuffed my gun in my lap. “I’m not doing this because I want to hurt you,” I managed to grit out. 

He blew a raspberry. “Honestly? I tuned out when you called me a *vessel*.”

Rowan groaned, tipping his head back. I had been expecting the slightest bit of empathy from him. Clearly, I was wrong. 

“You’ve already told us your weird cult story,” he said. “You’re going to achieve enlightenment from the moon, or whatever. Blah, blah, blah, the sky goes dark, blah, blah, blah, a hundred days of darkness.”

“It’s not *just* the moon,” I said, then caught myself before I could spill my heart out.

To a guy who despised me.

He nodded slowly. “Okay, soooo *what* is it if it's not the moon controlling your mind?”

It was my brother. 

Jonas’s survival, and our escape from my mother. 

I didn't say that, though, biting my lip. “Just drive.” I told him. “No more personal questions.”

He laughed bitterly, turning up the radio. 

“Sure.”

Rowan didn’t speak again until we were in the store. I instructed him to grab ingredients for a veggie Bolognese. 

The lights in the store reminded me of the moon—bright and invasive, sending a pulsing pain striking across the back of my skull. 

I was staring at the dairy aisle, trying to remember Imogen’s favorite brand of oat milk, when Rowan appeared next to me, holding a basket full of groceries. 

I raised my eyebrows at the giant red velvet birthday cake.

“Since when were you turning thirteen years old?”

Rowan almost looked defensive, leaning away from me, his lip curling. “Well, if I’m going to have my heart torn out, I want cake.”

“And you choose the worst one?”

He shrugged, copying me, pivoting on his heel and scanning the milk aisle.

Rowan was trying to find exactly what I was looking for. 

Imogen’s favorite oat milk. 

“Back in the car,” Rowan said casually, picking up a carton and peering at the back. “You said you didn’t want to hurt us.”

His breath hitched. “Which, if I’m right, means we’re  not the only ones being held against our will.”

His words were sharp, like the blunt edge of a knife. 

Jonas, my twenty year old brother, was all alone, chained inside a cold cell– at the mercy of our psychotic brainwashed Mom. 

“I do,” I said, my voice betraying me, breaking apart. I realized that what I was doing was fucking ridiculous. 

Imogen Prairie was going to die, and buying her favorite oat milk wasn’t going to change that. I abandoned my search, grabbing whole milk instead. 

When Rowan stepped away from me, I yanked him back, tightening my hold on his wrist. “I *am* going to kill you, Rowan,” I said through a steady breath, trying to ignore the jolt in his body, the way he stiffened, his hands forming fists. 

“And then I’m going to offer you to the moon.” I turned to him, fashioning my smile, mimicking my mother. 

“She's going to make you shine with her light.” I cupped his face, cradling his cheeks. “And you're going to be a wonderful King.”

When he didn't speak, petrified to the spot, I pulled the cake out of his basket, shoving it into his chest. “Put it back.” I muttered. 

Mom said I would enjoy having control over potential vessels, but I felt sick. 

“You won’t have time to eat it.” 

His head jerked, something splintering in his psyche. I saw it in his eyes. That light I was used to– that loosened the knot in my gut, was oblivion staring back. 

Still, he was Rowan Beck, the King of building walls around his emotions. He shot me a wide smile, his lip wobbling. “I'm sorry, I won't have *time*?”

I focused on the cheese section. “I’m starting with the preparations tomorrow,” I said, my heart in my throat. I couldn't look him in the eye. 

“You'll be dead long before you get to eat it. We’ll just be wasting it.”

He surprised me with a scoff. “Well, it’s my fucking money,” he spat in my ear, his facade slowly coming apart piece by piece. Rowan wasn’t nearly as smart as he thought he was—or as nonchalant. 

This kid was just a scared boy with a loud mouth—and I had just told him I was going to brutally sacrifice him to a celestial light. 

He snatched the cake from me, his breath cold against my ear. “If I want to buy myself a comfort cake, I will buy myself a comfort cake. Do you understand me?”

I ignored him, stepping away before I could splinter apart.

We bought the groceries, and the whole time, Rowan insisted on talking to the cashier for way longer than necessary, very obviously trying to drop hints. 

Luckily for me, the cashier had her headphones in, only entertaining Rowan’s ramblings with nods. 

When she responded with a simple, “Cool,” he gave up and stormed out of the store, hauling his abnormally sized birthday cake with him. 

It hit me when we were in the car, and he'd already ripped into the cake, stuffing chocolate frosting into his mouth, sniffling through sobs he thought I wasn't noticing. 

He was getting chocolate all over the wheel. Jonas and Mom had taught me how to suppress my emotion, but I couldn't control the visceral reaction in my body, bile creeping up my throat. 

“It's your birthday.” I whispered, and when he only responded with a snort, carving into the cake with one hand, and demolishing another slice, “Rowan, you're going to make yourself sick.”

He took a sharp turn, chocolatey slew dribbling down his chin. “Like I care,” he spat. “You said it yourself. I'm going to die.”

When Rowan took *another* sharp turn, I realized what he was doing. 

“Rowan.” I managed to get out. “Slow down.

He stamped on the gas, squeezing the wheel. 

“No.”

Rowan let out a sob I wasn't expecting. 

Not from the boy who constantly wore a mask. Who hid behind his attitude. 

“You said you don't want to hurt us,” his voice broke. “So, you're having second thoughts, right?”

When I didn't respond, retrieving my gun from under the seat and jabbing it in his gut, he broke apart, slowing down, taking another sharp turn, on purpose, making sure I whacked my head on the window. 

I watched him come apart, screaming into the wheel. It hurt me to see his self 
sabotage, his attempt at hurting himself. 

“That's what… what you said!” he twisted around to look at me, tears rolling down his cheeks, his breath hitching. I think his own denial was killing him. “Because you *don't* want to hurt us.”

“It's your birthday.” I said, ignoring his outburst. ""That's why you wanted that cake.""

When he refused to answer, reaching for *more* red velvet, I gently pulled it away. 

“How old are you turning?” I asked.

“Twenty-three.” He let out a shuddery breath, tripping over his words—words like poison, as if he hated himself for breaking.

“I’m twenty-three, and I’ve been a nihilistic asshole my whole life—constantly mocking my own existence and dwelling in my own existential hell.” 

Rowan was struggling again, sniffling. “But I’m twenty-three today, and I’m not even thirty yet. I’m still young—and if I survive, I’ll stop being a pretentious ass. I’ll stop thinking I’m better than everyone. Fuck!” He was crying now, no longer trying to hide his fear. “I don’t want to die,” he whispered. “I… I don’t want to die.”

I opened my mouth to speak, but he cut me off with a sob, his chest heaving, tears in free-fall. I averted my gaze before I did something I would regret. 

We were close enough. I could easily wrap my arms around him and give him that comfort he was crying out for. 

Instead, I stayed stiff in my seat, my stomach twisting into knots. 

“We have a tradition,” he said, when he'd cleaned himself up, swiping at his eyes. Rowan focused on the road, sniffling. 

“Every time it's someone's birthday, we get them a wildly incorrect cake.” Rowan let out a spluttered laugh. “For my twenty first, they got me a cake saying, *It's a boy*!”

I could sense a small smile pricking on my lips. I hadn't had a birthday since I was seventeen. 

“How about you?”

His question took me off guard. “What?”

Rowan shrugged, his gaze on the road. “How do you celebrate your birthday?”

I remembered my last 22nd birthday. I watched a sea of red pool at my mother’s feet. 

“I don't.” 

I caught something in his expression. But he didn't speak.

Rowan stopped talking. 

When we got home, pushing through the door, he took his time hauling the grocery bags up the steps. I turned to tell him to hurry up, and caught his retreating shadow trying to run. 

But not before I was two steps ahead of him, pressing the barrel of my gun against the back of his head—this time, hard enough to hurt. I was right about him planning to run, which meant his breakdown in the car was pure pantomime. 

If Rowan got away, Jonas was dead. I wouldn't be getting that happy ending with my family.

But as I dragged him back inside, I couldn't breathe. It wasn’t fair that I was feeling this. Why was I sweating? Why were my legs shaking?

Why did I want to let him go?

The door was wide open, which meant he could easily shout for help.

Grabbing my roll of duct tape, I slapped a strip over his mouth, stabbing the barrel harder into his spine. 

“Get on your knees,” I said through clenched teeth, willing myself to stop trembling. I yanked his hands behind his back to tie them, but I wasn’t expecting him to fight back. 

Part of me was in awe at how effortless he twisted, moving like water, as if the moon was already inside him, disarming me in one swift movement. 

The gun fit in his hands as if it had always belonged there, his grip unnervingly perfect. 

Ripping off the gag, wincing, he was panting but, unbelievably, grinning—wildly, almost feral.

“Nin wants to tell us something,” Rowan gasped out. “Right, Nin?”

When he trained the barrel between my eyes, I stumbled back. 

“Say it.” Rowan gritted out. 

I didn't– couldn't– say it. When I swallowed the words, he pulled the trigger. 

Imogen screamed, Kaz muffling at him to stop. 

He shot me again. 

And again. 

And again. 

His arm whipped out, and he shot an empty round into the door. 

“It's blank.” Rowan announced, letting the weapon slip from his hands, his eyes narrowing. “Say it.” he spat through a breath. “Tell us exactly what you feel.""

I felt my whole body fall limp, my last ditch effort to save my brother, shattering into nothing. 

But I couldn't deny the words choking my throat. “I don't want to hurt you.”  

Kaz reached for his phone I had kept on the coffee table, but Rowan shook his head.

“No cops,” he said. “I want to talk to her.” 

Rowan took a step forward, and I instinctively took one back. 

Instead of shooting another blank, though, Rowan kicked my gun under the door, and gestured to the dining table. 

""Sit.”

I found my voice, glancing at Kaz and Imogen, who looked equally confused. When Imogen tried to lunge forward, Kaz gently dragged her back, murmuring to her. 

“What?” I whispered. 

Rowan sighed, plonking himself down on the floor, crossing his legs.

“Fine. Sit on the floor with me.”

I did, slumping onto my knees, surprised to find the weight on my shoulders was lighter. 

After a moment, he shocked me with a laugh. “I was right,” he said, his own voice betraying him, splintering into a sob. “You’re being held against your will too.”

I didn’t respond, lost somewhere between breaking down on the kitchen floor and spilling everything from my lips—our forced indoctrination into the cult, my mother’s brainwashing, and the promise to save my brother. 

I wasn’t sure if I was hallucinating, but at some point, Imogen appeared by my side. She grasped my hands, entangling her fingers with mine. 

Half-delirious, I tried to scrub away the markings I had cut into her palm. She was so warm, letting me sob into her shoulder.

Kaz didn't speak, but he did make me hot tea. 

We talked all night, and the three decided they were going to help me save my brother. 

Three days later, I was in the back of Kaz’s car. 

Imogen was next to me, her arms wrapped around a shoebox. 

Kaz had a plan– sort of. 

The cult was expecting three human hearts for the preparation ceremony.

So, after a lot of digging (and weird looks), we had three pig hearts, ready for offering. 

Kaz said pig hearts resembled human hearts, so it should work– in theory. 

“Remember,” Rowan spoke up from the passenger seat. He didn't turn around, his gaze glued to the window, late afternoon sunlight setting strands of his hair alight. 

“All you need to do is dump the hearts, grab your brother, and run,” he said. 

“We’ll have the car ready.” Rowan leaned back in his seat with a sigh. 

“If you're right about the cops knowing about the cult and even helping these freaks, then we’re on our own.”

Directing Kaz to the rendezvous, my housemate drove me to the edge of Stix forest, where I'd be meeting Mom. 

Imogen handed me the box, and gave me an awkward hug. 

I didn't understand their willingness to forgive me. I felt myself melt into her, grateful for the warmth of her sweater– her flowery scent sending my heart into my throat. 

After everything I did to them, these three still cared. 

“Come *back*,” Imogen whispered into my shoulder. She didn't let go when I tried to pull back. “If things seem weird, just run away.”

Kaz, leaning against the trunk, offered me a wonky smile, and a two fingered salute. 

Rowan stayed in the car, his back to me. I didn't blame him, but it still hurt. 

Leaving the three of them at the clearing, I stepped straight into cult-territory. 

I knew exactly where the carefully laid out traps were, designed to cripple strangers, jumping over a rope stamped into the dirt. 

Mom instructed me to meet her at the elder tree, under a crescent moon. 

Tipping my head back, a sliver of moonlight poked through the thick canopy of trees, and I shivered, tightening my grip around the box of pig hearts. I wasn't expecting candlelight under the elder tree, blurred orange lighting up the dim. 

“Mom?” I started forwards hesitantly, quickening my steps. 

I wasn't looking where I was going, searching for her familiar ghostly face, when I glimpsed a figure bowed under the tree. Someone was praying.

I took another step, and another, until my worn converse were stepping in something wet, a pooling darkness soaking the ground. I didn't feel the box slip from my hands, or hear my own cry slice through the silence. I should have known. 

Still lit candles, blood that was warm, still wet, soaking into the ground. I was on my knees, suddenly, retching, sobbing into familiar sandy curls that were so distinct, so familiar. Bile shot up my throat. 

My trembling hands didn't feel real, trying to find a pulse. 

Trying to find his *face*. 

Jonas’s body had been perfectly laid out, his head severed from his torso. 

He was another sacrifice, another body left to rot. 

I screamed for my mother, pulling my brother’s body to my chest and holding him, stroking his skin covered in markings. 

*Luhar*. 

*Nathur*. 

*Velilua*. 

“Mom.” I didn't trust my own voice, my broken screech ripping through my lips. 

I pulled what was left of my brother to my chest, rocking him, burying my face in his hair. I could have saved him. I could could have fucking saved him. I was so *close*. 

So close.

“Nin.”

I was shrieking, trying to justify my brother’s death, trying to scream for my mother, when warm arms wrapped around me, pulling me into a clumsy embrace. 

I didn't want it. I didn't want him anywhere near me, a constant fucking reminder that I chose him over my own flesh and blood– the one person I had left. 

I tried to shove him away, my voice breaking into words, words that didn't make sense, words that should have hurt him, words I instantly regretted. 

But he was warm. 

When his arms wrapped around me once again, this time harsher, and yet closer, an anchor keeping me from well and truly falling, plunging into despair. 

He smelled like cheap cologne and stale coffee, but I found myself clinging onto it, clinging onto him, and letting myself fucking break. 

When my cries were raw and broken and dying out, the muted world came back to me in sputters. I was half aware of Rowan kneeling in front of me, his head buried in my shoulder. 

He was trembling, or maybe *I* was trembling, the two of us felt both right and wrong, and losing myself in his smell, his heavy breaths and murmurs that everything was going to be okay, I realized he *was* home. 

Bathed in moonlight that bounced off him– and I was so thankful it did, Rowan Beck didn't sympathise with me– and that was okay, because I didn't want his pity.

But he did pull me to my feet, steadying me when my legs gave-way. 

“Nin,” his voice didn't feel real, waves crashing against rocks. “*look* at me.”

In my half-delirious state, I did, my chest heaving, my stomach contorting– I couldn't fucking breathe. I couldn't *breathe*, and his eyes were what caught me off guard. 

Brown, with hints of ember-like orange. 

“We can walk away,” he said, softly. “You and me. We can go back to the car, and  not look back.”

Twin footsteps behind me sent my body into fight or flight. But they were familiar, hesitant at first, then quickening. 

Before I knew what was happening, Imogen’s face was buried in my shoulder, and Kaz’s arms awkwardly pulled me into a hug. Rowan wrapped his arm around my shoulder, the three of them dragging me away from my brother’s body. 

I caught Rowan’s glance at Jonas—his eyes glittering with tears.

He looked away, his lip wobbling. 

“Let's go home,” was all he said, leading the way back to the car. 

Imogen was quick to pull my head onto her lap in the backseat and I remember the lull of the car swaying me back and forth. The three of them took me back to their home, pulled me upstairs, and tucked me into my bed. 

I didn't speak for a long time– but I didn't need to. 

Imogen brought me meals and drinks, sometimes curling into bed with me, running her fingers through my hair– telling me stories. 

Kaz sat by my bed like a personal therapist, repeatedly telling me I was okay– I was safe. Nobody was going to hurt me. Rowan kept his distance for a while. But then he started to appear in my doorway, scowling his usual scowl. 

“Do you want to, uhhh, maybe watch a movie?” turned into the two of us binge watching everything. 

I'm not sure when it was when I turned to him for emotional relief. 

When I found myself wrapped around him, my head nestled on his shoulder.

When I stopped resenting him for being here– while my brother *wasn't*. 

The memory jerked, pulling me back to the real world. 

Back to lying under the moon’s light, as she hollowed me out. 

My voice had been burned from my throat, my body a puppet cut from its strings. I was partially aware of Her filling my blood, hitting every dead nerve ending, entangling around my skull and delving into my brain. Rowan was still there, his breath in my ear, choked with hysterical giggles. 

“Wow.” he chuckled. “Who would have thought that the *whole* time, you were the fucking problem?” Rowan leaned closer. “That *you* ruined the lives of three strangers, and inserted yourself into their little family.” he jumped back, “It's kinda poetic.”

I bit back a cry when his fingers tiptoed down my arm. 

“Funny how that works, huh.”

With no mouth, no *voice*, I couldn't respond. 

“I wanna show you one morreeee thing,” he sang. “It's what she showed *me*, Nin,” he sighed, his eyes basking in her light. 

“It's what turned me into this.” Suddenly, she wasn't subtle anymore, speaking directly through him, his voice turning melodic, watery. “Oh, darling, you should have seen his face– his mind broke into pieces, and I put him back together again!”

Rowan leaned closer, her light seeping from him, scolding my skin. “Again and again, and *again*, until he stopped screaming, *begging* me for mercy,” she  mocked his cry, “and finally let meeeee in.”

He prodded me in the face, giggling. 

“Just like *you* did! When you finally offered me young Rowan as a King.”

The moon gripped my chin, forcing me to look at him. His lips grazed mine, chuckling. 

“Ask me how I died, Nin. *Please*.” His head tipped back, lips parting in a moan. “It's all he wants to hear– oh, his tortured mind and soul *wants* to hear you say it.”

I didn't have to ask. The memory was already slamming into me. 

Three figures in our doorway, each of them I knew. 

Dex, Noah, and Harry.

Three of the moon cult’s brainwashed followers. 

“We’re not interested.” Kaz stood in front, his arms folded. “Leave.”

When Noah pulled out a gun, shooting Kaz dead, the world spun around. 

Imogen crumpled into a heap, and I didn't even see the bullet hit her. 

“Rowan!”

I only found my voice when Rowan was bleeding out in my arms, his eyes flickering back and forth, blood spilling from his lips. I told him not to speak, and not to be scared. 

Holding him to my chest, I told him that no matter what, I was going to save him. The moon’s followers left quickly, knowing exactly what I was going to do. 

Wrapping them in a knitted blanket I pulled off of Rowan’s bed, I dumped their bodies in Kaz’s car, and drove to the town lake. Mom wanted vessels for royals. 

She *wanted* human skins for the moon’s light. 

I carved her name into the dirt, and my plea to her light.

Even coming back as her puppets, her royals, King's and a Queen drenched in blood, they would still be *alive*. 

So we would keep living together– our family. 

The family I didn't know I wanted - no, *needed* - until they were gone. 

*Luhar.*

*Nathur.*

*Velilua.*

Sobbing, my trembling fingers kept messing up.

I carved out each of their hearts, just like the moon told me to. 

*”Luhar.”*

*”Nathur.”*

*”Velilua.”*

The words tangled on my tongue, exploding into sobs. 

“Luhar… Nathur… Velilua….!”

Picking up Kaz’s body, I dropped him into the lake.

I scooped Imogen into my arms, carefully lowering her into the shallows, before crawling over to Rowan, who was so still, so cold, his dead eyes tracking the dark sky. 

I bent down and kissed him, an eternal binding, a promise, that I wasn't letting him go. She came quicker than thought, illuminating the shallows I was sitting in, ankle deep, his head on my lap. 

Her song bled inside my skull, curious, sending a shiver down my spine. 

“Oh, my sweet child,” She hummed, Her voice somehow benevolent, yet mocking.

“I am *so* sorry for your loss, Nina. They were sweet souls.”

“Bring them back.” I lurched forward, burying my head in the ground. 

Praying, just like my mother. 

I could sense Her already seeping inside them, malevolent and greedy. 

“I can take it all away,” she murmured, filling my head with could-have-beens. 

It was just me and them, living in Bolivia House. There were no cults, no dead brothers, no hatred and disdain and endless pain neither of us could bury. 

I didn't realize how much I wanted it until I begged her, letting her pick apart my brain. 

My own voice faded as she dragged it from my mouth, filling me with bliss, with the life I had always craved.

“Bring them back!” I buried my head in my knees, sobbing.

Her glow was warm, soothing my aching bones.

“In any way I want?” she hummed. “Any shape I want?”

Her voice trickled through me. “I can shape and mold them in any way I desire?”

“Yes,” I gritted out, digging my nails into the ground.

“Give him to me,” she commanded.

I did, gently pushing Rowan off my lap, letting the water envelope him.

She drew back with a melodic laugh, her light illuminating the water before dancing behind the clouds.

When the first prickles of dawn broke through the sky, I was sitting on the riverbank with my head balanced on my knees, a butterfly caught in the breeze. 

Confusion, swiftly followed by panic, crept down my spine. I couldn't remember why I was there so late.

Why, when I swiped at my eyes, I was *crying*.

“Nin? Come on, we’re leaving.”

Twisting around, Imogen Prairie stood behind me, shivering in shorts and a t-shirt, her sandals hanging from one hand. She pulled me to my feet, grinning.

“That is the last time we go moon-watching with the boys,” she laughed, tugging me closer. I found myself reveling in her warmth. “I can't feel my feet!”

We traipsed our way back to the car, where Kaz was waiting, a knitted blanket over his shoulders. Impatient, as usual, arms folded, like a divorced father of three.

I smirked at the Ray-Bans perched on his head. “You're looking progressively more dad-like as the days go by.”

Kaz shot me the finger, his lips curving into a smirk.

“Yeah, but unlike others, I actually *rock* the look.”

I pulled a face. “You're the most millennial Gen Z I've ever met.”

Kaz grinned. “I’ll take that as a compliment!” He threw the car-keys keys at Imogen. “Since you enjoy complaining, you can drive us home.” he jutted his chin, gesturing to Rowan, whose head was comfortably pressed against the back window. “Since our ‘designated driver’ has passed out.*

“I'm not *passed out*,” Rowan grumbled from the car. “I'm clearly resting my eyes.”

I shoved Kaz with my hip. “Immie’s been with me, and she's barely complained.”

He shot me a pointed look. “Were you knocked on the head? She ranted about mosquitoes for three hours.”

Imogen took the keys, jumping into the driver's seat. “Of course I enjoy complaining! It's one of many things I'm good at.”

“The only thing she's good at,” Rowan grumbled from the backseat, his chin perched on Kaz’s seat once I wiggled in with him. 

When Imogen twisted around, thwacked him with her fly swatter, he groaned. “She's just pissed I forgot the bug spray.” Rowan rolled his eyes, reaching for his flask and taking a long drink.

He spat it out immediately, all over his lap.

“Rowan, this is a new car.” Kaz spoke through his teeth. 

“That's disgusting.” Rowan swiped his mouth. “What the fuck is *that*?”

“It's coffee, Einstein,” Kaz twisted around in his seat, his eyebrows furrowing. “I made it earlier.”

“Well, it tastes like shit!” Rowan shoved the flask in Kaz’s face. “Here. Try it.”

“I don't wanna taste shitty coffee, dude.”

Rowan groaned, bouncing in his seat like a little kid. “No, seriously, try it!”

Kaz did, rolling his eyes, before he too lost his composure and spat it out.

“Urgh!”

“Stop throwing up all over the car!” Imogen squeaked, gripping the wheel. “Do I really need to remind two grown adults not to make a mess?”

“It's not my fault Kaz brewed expired coffee!” Rowan shot back.

I looked at Kaz for some kind of explanation, but he looked oddly sickly.

“You're serious,” I said when Kaz sent me a wounded puppy look.

“Rowan's right,” he stuck out his tongue. “That tastes like literal ass.”

“You two are animals,” Imogen muttered, flicking on the radio.

Curious, I snatched the coffee from Rowan’s lap and took a hesitant sip.

*It was… coffee*.

Sweet and bitter, running down my throat.

“I have no idea what you're talking about,” I said. “It tastes fine.”

Rowan ignored me, tipping his head back, groaning.

I could have sworn, at just the right angle, his teeth looked…*sharper*?

“Hey, can we stop at a drive-thru?” he groaned. *“I'm like, really fucking hungry.”*

–

Rowan's words lingered in my mind, the memory shattering into nothing. 

I was yanked back to reality.

This time, though, I wasn't in pain anymore.

Pain didn't exist.

Only the skylight above, the moon shining down on me, and their teeth ripping through me, their hands snapping my bones one by one, scooping up my insides and gorging on me. 

I was still alive, still breathing without lungs, without a heart, without a brain to think with, to form logical thought. 

Three shadows, three royals, drenched in red and bearing human flesh as shawls, human bones as jeweled crowns. 

With no mouth to scream with, I allowed them to rip me apart, over and over, trying to tear into the black and white static stitching me back together again.

They were merciless, never stopping or faltering, gorging themselves.

With me.

I think I started to understand when I could no longer recognize Kaz through the thick beads of red running down his face.

The slithering human flesh that was still alive, patching his skin back together.

Imogen’s empty eyes.

Rowan’s monstrous, grinning snarl as he choked on my pulsing flesh.

I couldn't save them.

However, thanks to my memories, I knew exactly how to kill them.

My eyes found Rowan, the most merciless, ripping me apart, even when I was barely together, tangled static.

Kill him.

For good.

“That's right,” the cult-woman's voice soothed the royals, coaxing them to continue. “There you go. Eat, my darlings.”

I didn't react to the voice. I couldn't.

I wouldn't.

The woman with greying hair and a beautiful, youthful glow.

Who worshipped the moon and murdered my brother.

Maybe the moon was actually empathetic, ripping away my memories of her.

Mom.

“Isn't this what you have always wanted?” Mom hummed. 

She knelt in front of me, placing a crown of adorned bone on my head.

I recognized it as what was left of Sam’s skull. She bowed, her lips splitting into a grin, her eyes leaking moonlight.

Hi! I am looking primarily for friendship, potentially open to more if it occurs naturally, but not searching for anything more specifically. 

A bit about the type of person I’m looking for: 
I live in western Canada, so a similar time zone to that would be ideal(exact same time zone not necessary, any North American time zone is close enough). I am looking for someone aged 30+(this is a hard boundary). Does not expect constant/instant replies. I would like there to be daily communication, but I’m not constantly glued to my phone. I am looking for someone that is willing and able to put effort into conversation(I will do the same). I am looking for someone kind, fun, maybe a little bit funny, and genuine. Other than that, I’m very open to most other things and am not looking for a specific “type” of person! I’m looking for friendship first and foremost, but wouldn’t be opposed to it if the friendship evolved into something a bit more flirty/feelings develop. That being said, I’m not *looking* for something serious, nor do I have any intention of relocating or anything like that. 



A bit about me/some general interests: 

I love to listen to music, my favorite band since I was 15 lol is Blink 182(have seen them live three times). I like to watch movies and tv shows(who doesn’t?) - I’m definitely a horror girly, but I like other things too! I love ghosts and fall.  I love to shop and get my nails done. I’m a little obsessed with Jellycats. Also a little obsessed with Bobs Burgers.  I love coffee. I’m very close with my family, we spend a lot of time together. I like to try and stay active, and get at least a bit of exercise daily. 
Here are a couple photos of me https://imgur.com/a/5P3SHJq


If you think this sounds like something you’d be interested in, please contact me(chat preferred over DM). Please only message me if you are going to include some context - tell me about yourself, start a conversation based on something I’ve mentioned in my post, it’s up to you but I will likely not spend any effort on “hey” or smalltalk responses.

1gz42my,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gz42my,"Listen, Obey, and be Gaslit","This past Saturday I got a text from someone in my old congregation that I hadn’t heard from in years. They texted me asking if I wanted food from a popular service break spot that’s about 15 minutes south of my house. The Kingdom Hall is about 10 minutes north of where I live, leaving my house right in the middle of the break stop and the Kingdom Hall. 

About 45 minutes after I get this text, I hear a knock at my door. Knowing who it was, I didn’t answer. I didn’t want to entertain a conversation at the moment because I felt enraged by the hypocrisy and insincerity of the text.

I’ve been POMO for about 4 years. I’m not disfellowshipped but I have been treated that way by my old friends and family since I stopped attending meetings. I didn’t think I’d get to personally experience the joy of being invited to a meeting after years of radio silence from my so-called “friends” but here we are.

Anyways, these were my responses to the texts… After she sent the text about “mistaking her genuineness as insincere” I wanted to figure out how to expose the lie because I knew she has no interest in me as a person but simply saying that wouldn’t be proof. I thought about how to expose the lie and figured “hey, two can play this game” so I invited her to grab a beer or coffee, knowing full well she would never take me up on it.

Of course, her response was “we *should* go to a meeting.” At that point I felt beyond aggravated. It’s sickening to me how out of touch the JW’s are and honestly almost sad to me that they truly believe they care about others because they “invite them to a meeting”.

The most unsettling thing is this is probably how I would’ve handled this situation, too, when I was still PIMI. I’m not sure whether to feel disgust or pity for the people that used to be my “friends”…",112,1732489011.0,exjw,46,1.0,False

(Cleaning/organizing/studying)

So I woke up at 11:00- got out of bed to brush my teeth- then sat back on my bed and got distracted by my phone. I said “oh let me look at this tiktok my sister just sent me” and I am not exaggerating this- from 11:30-3:30 I sat in my bed on my phone and didn’t get up once. Even though I knew I had so much to do and I knew I only wanted to do it when it was light outside, it’s like I just couldn’t do it like I was paralyzed. 

I’m so sad. I even got up at 3:30 and was like “okay let me go buy myself some coffee as motivation to start cleaning” so I did… but just like every other time I got the coffee and proceeded to sit in my car drinking it while scrolling on my phone. So now it is 4:30 and dark out. It’s like I want to do something so bad but my brain doesn’t allow it. I’m so sad. 

Somebody please give me tips because I can’t continue to live like this. Even if it’s blunt- please let me hear it. My room has been an absolutely disaster for almost a month now. So many clothes that I can’t see the floor and it’s making me feel so stupid and lazy. 

Anything will help, please. How did I just completely waste 5 hours of my life. 

(TLDR: I wasted 5 hours of my life from the time I woke up until now when it’s dark out- having accomplished none of the things that I said I was going to do.
