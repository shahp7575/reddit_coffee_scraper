1pwn78h,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1pwn78h/finding_a_couple_of_american_ingredients/,Finding a couple of American ingredients.,"I am looking for American style corn meal. I had plans to bring some from the US to make southern cornbread for my fiancé when I got here but she said I didn’t need to, we can find the ingredients.. now we cannot find the ingredients. We searched Kaldi Coffee and none of their stores had any in stock. I was wondering if around the Nagoya area, this would be possible to find? Maybe something similar. 

I typically use White Lily or Weisenberger mill when I’m home in Kentucky. But anything similar to the texture of American cornmeal would be great! Thanks ",1,1766805273.0,JapanTravelTips,0,1.0,False

Few recommendations:

- Wildflour Rockwell Al Fresco, seldom matamaan ng araw and even then they have umbrellas. Positioned to be windy in-between buildings and cool even if its noon. Hives do not flare up. Good for people and dog-watching. Downsides, madami kang makikitang kakilala pero tago ka naman.
- Pink’s High Street Shangri-la BGC, hindi rin natatamaan ng araw bcs of the umbrellas and trees and positioned to be windy rin, even if its noon. Wala ring hives. Good for people and dog-watching. Downside nga lang is baka makilala ka ng kakilala mo at hindi ka tago, so magdala ka ng sunglasses para walang small-talk if ever.

I’m not sure pa if may ganyan here Salcedo. Preferably Salcedo but Legazpi is okay. I really looked pero wala pa for now. Baka there’s some places I haven’t gotten to yet?

im 23F , he seems to be 26M- So I go to this cafe once every two weeks but they recognise me, I always ask how the person serving me is doing. I go in today and the queue is so long that the cafe is completely packed and its also very understaffed.

I get to the front, I ask the guy at the till how hes doing (we have seen each other a few times) hes around my age, he tells me hes rlly tired and how understaffed they are and how he is always tired when he sees me. I go ""yh, i almost didn't enter, I dont want to burden u with my coffee with how busy it is here"" he goes ""you can burden me anytime with your coffee"" and I laugh so he asks what i want and I tell him.

Despite the crowds waiting on their drinks or waiting to order he leaves the till (hes not meant to be making drinks) and goes and makes me my coffee and gives it to me instantly and doesnt charge me for it, rhe people who ordered before me didnt even get theirs yet. Anyways I say thank u, but i think he didnt want anyone to know it was free for me. I usually get a small but he made it a large too.

Also this is random, but when u get an iced drink theres a customer self serving area where u can get a straw, sugar ect. Even tho usually customers are meant to get a straw themselves, he always gets it and prepares it for me ontop of my cup so i dont have to do a thing- which isnt standard.

1pwn1wb,https://i.redd.it/ii0uf98wxn9g1.jpeg,Will is an unreliable narrator and how his coming out could parallel Mike getting Vecna'd (theory (?)),"English isn't my first language so it might sound rough in places.
I wrote about the coming out scene, Will being an unreliable narrator, the Tammy parallel and how Vecna might target Mike during the last mission and how that could lead to Byler.
This is a bit long but I promise all the parts are important for the point I want to make. I also don't know if this even counts as a theory but anyway. We still have an episode to get byler and honestly, I've been 'delusional' for so long, what's another week?
Also credits to my friend u/IAMMIKEQUEELER she helped me with this and wanted me to credit her.



Will's Coming out scene 

- it's bad at first sight but important for the plot 
- --> Will knows Vecna uses people's fears/insecurities against them (like he did to him in episode 4), in his case his homosexuality and how the group could react badly if they found out so he comes out to them to see how they would really react before Vecna has the chance to expose him and make him think they react badly 
(like how Vecna made Max think Lucas turned against her in season 4)
-----> MIKE DOESN'T know/expect this, he's never been targeted before (not like ALL the other Wheeler's)
--- we never see Mike's POV because it would spoil his feelings for Will and they might plan on revealing these when Mike is targeted by Vecna is episode 8

(The duffer brothers love slow burns untill the very end & might want to misguide us with all these recent interviews and the Tammy situation (more about that in another paragraph) so Mike's realisation and Byler love confession hits harder for everyone, including those who already shipped it)


Will is an unreliable narrator

(We see this at rinkomania// his POV: Mike and Jane seem happy, Angela's POV/the truth: they seem awkward/not laughing nor talking)
- We didn't get to see the sequence that Vecna (supposedly!) showed Will the second time Will tapped into the hive mind (the one in episode 6 where he fell unconscious) 
---> at the beginning of episode 6 it is revealed Will built the tunnels and at the end Will tells Jane Vecna knows where max is 
-- it is bad writing for Will to talk about the sequence with the other charactersand and for us not to see it (no emotional payoff), because if it's important the viewers should be showed. (And it is important because at the end, this was his final reason/motivation to actually come out and why he did it in front of the whole group)
UNLESS that's the whole point. If we assume Will is unreliable this could be a plot twist in some way. (I'm not sure how yet, if you have any ideas please share)


Will thinks Mike is his Tammy but that's not necessarily true 
-- he lies to himself about his own feelings (season 3 ""I'm not gonna fall in love""--> a lie, he already was in love with Mike at this point/ at least started to have feelings for him.)
He basically tries to tell himself it's ""not that deep"" so it doesn't hurt as much as it would if he accepted the truth. Mike isn't just a passing crush for Will, not just someone at school he sjares a few classes with --> Mike is Wills best friend since kindergarten, Mike was in his 8mm childhood film, Mike makes Will actually feel loved
-- he's bracing himself for rejection/accepting it before it even happens so Vecna can't use his heartache against him in the final fight so he isn't weak

(So yeah, again, maybe the duffer brothers want to rage bait us on purpose so we are even more happy/relieved when byler happens)


Mike is not only Will's weakness, but also Jane's. (Even if you don't ship Mileven, you have to agree their bond is still strong)


---> Final theory: Vecna will target Mike using his internalised homophobia. He will get into Mike's mind using this fear/insecurity to hurt/attempt to kill him to scare/distract Will and Jane at the same time. Since Mike is really important to both of them Vecna could easily distract Will and Jane with one blow. (If I were him that's what I would do lowk)
Also: maybe he already has been watching Mike? I've seen people already talk about this, how Mike drinks lots of coffee and just generally zones out a lot. This would explain his numbness/emotionless behaviour a bit.

Other side points to cure your Byler doubt
- no plot twist yet
(The duffer brothers said they love a good plot twist, but there haven't been any yet. And let's be fr, the wormhole theory was obvious/very foreseeable) 

Chekhov's gun (every detail must be important/ foreshadowing must pay off, otherwise it's simply bad writing)
- painting lie (this must come up again, Mike still doesn't know the painting is from Will/the audience needs to be shown of he does)
- avalanche of feelings (why include Robin telling Will clear signals someon likes Will if you're not expecting to look for other people doing that to Will)

1pwn0x4,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightlossJourney/comments/1pwn0x4/working_on_longterm_goals/,Working on long-term goals,"I’m an almost 29yo woman with PCOS, lucky enough to be a mother of 4. I am exclusively breastfeeding my youngest who is 5 months old just as I have done with all my children. Breastfeeding calculators with his age and weight say that he is consuming around 900 calories a day from me.

I am unfortunately close to 100lb overweight for my height. I’ve been this way for a decade, with nearly no weight gain in my pregnancies (and any minimal weight gain from my pregnancies has always fallen off within a week after birth). BMR is around 1800 calories. BMR + breastfeeding is 2700 calories. 

Despite being overweight, my health is actually good (blood sugar, liver, thyroid). I keep an eye on that religiously because my dad is Type 2 with NAFLD.

I’ve struggled with losing weight at all. I dieted a lot in my early 20s, no success beyond the 1 month I did the 800 calories a day diet (yes, I am aware now how stupid and dangerous that was).

I worked on my mental health and have gotten to a place where I want to lose weight not because of how I look, but because of what I want to model for my children. I grew up with my dad being overweight and his parents. I also am not happy with the thought of being fat and elderly. My father’s parents are very overweight and 80, life is rough on them. I no longer care about how the world views me, but gosh I am so nervous about what I will FEEL like as I age!

I started having back problems in my teens before I gained weight. Unfortunately all my siblings are the same way, all smaller than me with 2 of them being a healthy weight or underweight. My dad’s side of the family has a myriad of back issues with nearly all of them having multiple back surgeries. I am very aware that when I get into my 40s or 50s that back surgery may very well be something that I have to do. After seeing my grandparents and my dad struggle with recovery and being overweight, I do NOT want that same struggle. I would rather have the normal struggle of recovery.

My joints have started hurting before it rains and I’m feeling like an old lady. We recently went to a theme park, and the last ride (a small child’s ride no less) jerked in an usual way (not normal as we had ridden the ride many times because of the kids), and my back is still feeling tweaked because of it.

I already struggle with shoulder, neck, and head pain because of the size of my chest. Even if losing weight changes that just a little, I would absolutely love that.

Overall, my goal is give myself the future that future me deserves. I cut soda out (ugh, Dr Pepper is such a vice!). We are actually doing a multigenerational homestead and live very rural, so fast food is not an option. I am the primary cook and I do not buy ultra-processed foods. What has a very tight grip on this household is sweet tea. We live in the South, it is in our blood. We make it (1 cup sugar to a gallon or 1 tablespoon sugar to 8oz) or buy it (Milo’s). Coffee is simple, my husband is Cuban and makes cafecito or cafe con leche, which we have most mornings (but not every morning, including this morning). We do buy pulp orange juice (the more pulp the better), no added sugars obviously.

But sweet tea… that’s my biggest struggle right now. I’m one of those lame people who “doesn’t like water”. Especially in the morning. For some reason, it makes me nauseous. I have tried different temps, I have tried with fruits added, water in the morning just really turns my stomach. I am a very easy puker (hyperemesis with all my pregnancies), and I have genuinely gagged to the point of water coming back up while drinking it. YES I KNOW HOW STUPID THAT IS. I am painfully aware and extremely frustrated about it.

I think if I could become a water drinker, that it would really help me lose weight. I know that I’m drinking calories, and to compensate I usually skip breakfast. I am currently about 10 pounds less than my pre-pregnancy weight (so I guess about 2 pounds a month loss while breastfeeding), but I would like to change that to about a pound a week.

So just a guy looking to chat to keep simple. 😀,"I’m a 53-year-old male, married, with no kids. I am in the CST time zone in the US. I am not one to rock the boat and demand attention when real life calls. I am not one to judge, as I never went to law school. We all have our reasons for being here, and that is no one’s business but their own. 

Mine is simple: finding someone to correspond with. It can be on Reddit Chat, KIK, Telegram, email, and heck, even Morse Code.

We start our lives with a breath, never knowing when the last will come. It’s important to enjoy that ride between them. It’s why I enjoy chatting and corresponding with people. Maybe it's that rock that someone needs to vent to. That bad joke guy.

The one who has absorbed enough useless knowledge can talk on anything. I am open-minded and will research things. I just cannot believe something as fact. I admit I am a geek/nerd. I collected comic books as a kid, watch to much Anime, have models of WW2 aircraft, and a “few” Japanese swords.

I’m going to wrap this up, as I am likely having too many eyes going ugh, another loser. Hey, I am sure some readers have said that in their heads, if not out loud. I get it I am not the person all would want to correspond with. I prefer Black Tea over Coffee. (Fighting words I am sure)

I do prefer chatting to women. To my fellow men, no i am not gay or interested, and do not share photos of my wife.

So, if you got to this point, message me. I sometimes miss comments. Show you got here by stating your favorite time of day, morning, midday, evening, or late night.",1,1766804640.0,MakeFriendsOver30,1,1.0,False

im 23f - So I go to this cafe once every two weeks but they recognise me, I always ask how the person serving me is doing. I go in today and the queue is so long that the cafe is completely packed and its also very understaffed.

I get to the front, I ask the guy at the till how hes doing (we have seen each other a few times) hes around my age, he tells me hes rlly tired and how understaffed they are and how he is always tired when he sees me. I go ""yh, i almost didn't enter, I dont want to burden u with my coffee with how busy it is here"" he goes ""you can burden me anytime with your coffee"" and I laugh so he asks what i want and I tell him.

Despite the crowds waiting on their drinks or waiting to order he leaves the till (hes not meant to be making drinks) and goes and makes me my coffee and gives it to me instantly and doesnt charge me for it, rhe people who ordered before me didnt even get theirs yet. Anyways I say thank u, but i think he didnt want anyone to know it was free for me. I usually get a small but he made it a large too.

Also this is random, but when u get an iced drink theres a customer self serving area where u can get a straw, sugar ect. Even tho usually customers are meant to get a straw themselves, he always gets it and prepares it for me ontop of my cup so i dont have to do a thing- which isnt standard.

What do y’all think?","I (27F) don’t have much experience with men. Dating has never really been a concern of mine, so I kind of have a deficit in the “understanding men” department. I met a male coworker (25M) from another department about two months ago. He heard me talking to another male colleague and he interjected in the conversation to ask me a question about something I said (that’s how we met). I asked if he had a card. He didn’t have one, so he proceeded to ask two of his nearby coworkers if they had one. When they both said no, I offered my card and he accepted it. I was surprised when the next business day I actually heard from him with the information I had requested. 

We’ve only been around each other twice, but during those times I noticed he teased me (jokingly), kept eye contact so intense I felt the need to look away, he would ask questions about my job/office/duties but didn’t seem to ask anyone else about theirs (as far as I’m aware of), supported my opinions and ideas to the focus group each time, offered to grab a group of us coffee while staring directly at me, has smirked at me after I teased him back, and apologized directly to me in person after an email delay. He also had asked if I’d be at the next meeting and offered to stay behind to help me work during lunch on something (until he realized he had a calendar conflict). Our last goodbye was a little awkward because he wouldn’t really look at me but smiled kind of oddly and told me to have a good night after we left the meeting. 

He oscillates between seeming confident/normal and nervous/awkward/terse when I’m interacting with him. I emailed him and asked him if he wanted to meet sometime to talk something business related, and he accepted, suggesting a specific week (had to be pushed back a bit for the holidays). We meet in a few days, the first time it will be just us (at a coffee shop), and I’m just not sure how to view his possible interest before going in for this meeting. I want to flirt with him, let him know it’s reciprocated, but with it being work, I’m a little nervous of my perception being off.

# What Is the Manus 1.6 AI Agent?

**Manus 1.6 AI Agent** is a next-generation AI automation system built around *projects* and *connectors*.

Instead of asking for one-off tasks, you can create an AI workspace that handles daily workflows for you.

You can say things like:  
“Check my email, summarize updates, save them to Notion, then schedule a reminder on Calendar.”

And Manus will do all of that automatically.

It’s like Zapier — but powered by an AI brain.



# How Manus Connectors Actually Work

Connectors turn your AI agent into a digital operations assistant.

You can now link your:

* Gmail
* Google Drive
* Calendar
* Notion
* Slack
* Canva
* ZoomInfo
* Stripe
* Xero

Once connected, you can trigger automations that run in the background — even while you’re offline.

That means your AI can send emails, schedule meetings, and build reports all without you touching a keyboard.



# Building My First Project With Manus 1.6 AI Agent

I started by creating a project called “Daily AI News Brief.”

Here’s what it does:  
Every morning at 8 a.m., Manus automatically searches the web for the top 5 AI news updates, summarizes them, and saves the summary in a Google Doc.

Then it emails me the link — all before I’ve had my first coffee.

It even built the folder in Drive and formatted the document automatically.

That’s when I realized this wasn’t just a productivity update — this was full-scale automation.



# Automating an Entire Workflow

Next, I tried connecting Manus to Google Calendar.

I gave it a simple task:  
“Create a calendar event for my live stream today at 4 PM and send an invite to my Gmail.”

Within seconds, it:

* Created a Calendar event with the title and details.
* Sent an email invite using Gmail.
* Added the recording reminder to Drive.

I didn’t touch anything.

It just worked.

That’s what’s crazy about **Manus 1.6 AI Agent** — it can use multiple connectors *in the same project*, chaining them together like human workflows.



# Advanced Automations You Can Build With Manus 1.6 AI Agent

You can build automation stacks like this:

* **Daily Research Briefs:** Automatically summarize AI updates and email yourself.
* **Client Reporting:** Pull data from analytics, export to Sheets, and share a Drive link.
* **Social Posting:** Draft posts, upload visuals via Canva, and publish using connected APIs.
* **Team Alerts:** Post daily updates or Slack reminders across your team automatically.

Each project is reusable.

You just click “Run,” and your agent does everything for you.



# How Connectors Transform Workflows

Before this update, Manus could run tasks individually.

Now, you can chain them — Gmail to Drive to Calendar to Slack — like a flow.

It’s what I call *agentic automation*: one AI coordinating multiple tools like a real assistant.

This is where the **Manus 1.6 AI Agent** stands out — it bridges human workflows and autonomous execution.

It doesn’t just “help.”

It *handles*.



# Manus + Claude = The Perfect Pair

To generate ideas for my workflows, I paired Manus with Claude 4.

I asked Claude to brainstorm automation ideas — then plugged those prompts into Manus.

For example:  
“Pull top AI news, summarize, save to Drive, and post to LinkedIn.”

Claude handled the strategy.  
Manus handled the execution.

This combo gave me a live-stream-ready brief every morning.

No input required.



# Real-Time AI in Action

What blew me away was watching it work in real time.

The browser tab opened automatically.  
It searched the web.  
It compiled news summaries.  
It saved everything into Drive — live.

And while that was happening, it still had another connector scheduling my stream and another sending the email invite.

Multiple AIs.  
Multiple connectors.  
One system running it all.



# Integrating With Google Calendar and Gmail

Here’s how I set it up:

* Connect Gmail → for sending updates.
* Connect Calendar → for scheduling.
* Connect Drive → for saving outputs.

Then I just said:  
“Create an event today at 4 PM and email me the invite.”

It used Google APIs to create the event, sent the email, and confirmed success.

Minutes later, the invite appeared in my inbox — with all the details included.



# Manus 1.6 AI Agent Isn’t Just a Tool — It’s a System

Once you create your first project, you’ll realize how big this is.

It’s not about one-time tasks.

It’s about building *persistent AI workspaces* that think, act, and repeat automatically.

You can design your own flows once, and they’ll run forever.

That’s leverage — the kind that scales teams and businesses.

# Why Manus 1.6 AI Agent Matters

We’ve hit a turning point in automation.

This isn’t about chatbots anymore.

This is about connected intelligence.

**Manus 1.6 AI Agent** shows what happens when AI stops being a “tool” and starts being a *teammate*.

When your AI can talk to your calendar, email, browser, and design tools — that’s not productivity.

That’s transformation.

Hey Maximizame fam! 👋

Ever feel like those massive life overhauls are just too much to even *think* about? Like, changing everything overnight sounds exhausting and frankly, a little impossible? I get it. We all have those big dreams, right? The ones where we're suddenly a completely different, optimized version of ourselves.

But here's the thing that's been really clicking for me lately: **it’s the tiny, consistent steps that build the foundation for those massive transformations.** We're talking about the almost invisible shifts that, over time, compound into something truly extraordinary.

Think about it:

*   **Morning Rituals:** Instead of hitting snooze five times, what if you just aimed to get up 15 minutes earlier? Use that extra time for a quick stretch, a few pages of a book, or just a quiet cup of coffee. It’s not a marathon, it’s just a gentle nudge.
*   **Mindful Moments:** Feeling overwhelmed? Instead of letting it spiral, try a 60-second breathing exercise. Just breathe in, breathe out. Simple, yet profoundly effective at resetting your nervous system.
*   **Learning on the Go:** Got a commute? Instead of scrolling endlessly, pop in a podcast on a topic you're curious about. Even 10 minutes of new information can spark ideas and broaden your perspective.
*   **Nutrition Nudges:** Can't overhaul your diet tomorrow? Start with one small win. Add one extra glass of water to your day. Or swap one sugary drink for sparkling water. Baby steps!
*   **Movement Matters:** Not ready for a full gym session? Take the stairs instead of the elevator. Go for a short walk during your lunch break. These little bursts of activity add up.

It’s about building momentum. It’s about proving to yourself, day after day, that you are capable of making positive changes. These aren’t drastic measures; they’re subtle adjustments that, when practiced consistently, lead to profound shifts in how you feel, think, and perform.

Sometimes, though, even these small steps can feel tough, and that's perfectly okay. Life throws curveballs, and navigating emotional challenges is part of the journey. If you're looking for some extra support and guidance on building resilience and working through difficult emotions, I've found [this resource (affiliate link)](https://praneetbrar.com/digistore24/make-my-plan/#aff=maximizame) to be incredibly helpful.

I'm 15yo and my dad was diagnosed with ALS a few weeks ago. Ever since he's been diagnosed, I've been extremely anxious for not just him but for my mom too.

I'm literally always with my dad. I moved all my stuff into the living room (Where his bed is) to be with him. I feel like if I leave to go to the to toilet once he might get up to go to the toilet and fall, or try to drink coffee and burn himself. Every second I don't see him my nerves spike and I immediately run back to check on him.

Same thing with my mom. I've become extremely protective of her and I can't seem to stop.

1pwmq7d,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1pwmq7d/mf_the_leopard/,[MF] The Leopard,"“Grab the rail,” he advised. She lurched backward as the bus pulled away. “I like to hold my lid like this, see? Keeps it from spilling when the bus brakes.” The freckles on her nose crinkled while she contemplated a snide retort. She grasped the cold metal, shifting her fragile body further from him, closer to the stranger sitting in the single seat along the window.

The thought of bolting at the next stop briefly surfaced and passed. She sipped her coffee instead, gripping the foam cup in her other hand as the bus continued. Perhaps these meetings were working after all, or maybe she just craved the taste of bitterness.

His voice kept going. A buzzing gnat fluttering around her ear while she was trapped in thought – reassuring herself of belonging among the same people she once considered soulless sell-outs. The perfectly styled hair, sprayed down sleepily before sunrise. The quiet, consuming stare into their phones, filling each moment with a constant flow of entertainment. Desperate fingers clacking and swiping, looping through endless cycles, while their tired eyes hastily run along the lengths of the screen. Complete disconnection from reality around them. Sounds familiar.  

She counted each stop, each person who got on or off. The ones who didn’t tap their phone. The ones who stood too close to the exit, triggering the irritating warning. Ten people wore jeans, two people were sleeping. One couple sat silently a few rows ahead, legs pressed together. Two young kids screamed over their parent’s phone, tiny fingers clawing for control.

Without realizing it, she did the math. Old reflex.  

Surely, she could move through this world the way she always had – alert, clever, relying on a charm that carried her through worse places than this, ones with sharper edges and harsher rules. She could learn the rhythm, soften into it, pass for ordinary long enough to call it progress. She had thought that before. The timing changed. But the outcome was always the same.

…

The smell of old metal crept by as she shifted in her chair, awaiting her turn. Her lips parted as she exhaled, weighing who to reveal. 

One by one, each member recited their story. A man with a rasp in his voice described the first warm taste of beer at the ripe age of twelve, breaking into his mother’s stash after she passed out cold on their smoke-stained couch. A woman younger than her played a solo game of thumb-wrestling as she recounted the weekend. A friend’s birthday at a bar – how tragic.

The stench of sweat and stale coffee made her want to leave. 

The circle moved on. 

The chairman’s overzealous gaze landed on her, followed by an obnoxious nod and a quick wave of his stout, hairy hand. 

“My name’s Laura and I’m an addict.”

Here we go.

“I guess I’m here,” she cleared her throat, biting back a pile of self-pity word salad, “‘cause I’m over it.” 

A reverb of mundane, robotic chatter filled the hot church backroom, toward her section of the circle. The group echoed their solemn reply: “Hi Laura.” She crossed one leg over the other, nearly losing her balance on the lopsided folding chair.

She briefly revealed some story of despair – the rehearsed, tamed version that she recited during the more boring meetings. Nothing about the lifetime of brutal abuse she endured from her father or the agonizing abyss inside her from her late concubine. None of the obvious events that would explain why she belonged in these groups. Because any one of those terrible happenings a human could endure would justify her belonging. But this part was familiar.

…

She sat there on an uncomfortable office couch, designed to look overtly modern. The secretary’s tap tap tap of her pen against the glass desk, drilled its dull resonance into her. She couldn't stop herself from lingering over the woman’s appearance, acrylic red lips pouting toward a screen full of pretend work. Two windows overwhelmed with tabs – mainly shopping sites.  
The secretary caught her vacant stare, pausing before returning to her work.

“He’ll see you now, you can let yourself in.” 

She followed the command, shuffling toward the seven-foot burlwood door. She noticed the exit sign on the ceiling toward the end of the room, just beyond a row of identical, stark white cubicles. No personal effects lining the desks, an occasional plastic plant poking out the side of the smoked glass dividers. Her eyes linger on that exit for a moment too long, imagining a runner’s hundred-meter dash, ripping off her ill-fitted blazer loaned from some pity program. 

She blinked and continued toward the door.

A middle-aged man leaned forward in his oversized leather executive chair, perfectly fitted to him. A tall stack of documents rose beside him, the kind that probably grows by the end of each day. Behind him sat two full-grown bird of paradise plants, silhouetted against an obnoxiously clear, floor-to-ceiling view of the city. Sunlight skidded across the tacky decor, landing sharply in her eyes. 

“Please, have a seat.” He gestured toward another uncomfortable chair. 

Through a forced smile, she recited her lines, biting back a taste of resentment. She’s charming, she’s entertaining, she’s lying; she’s always been so good at that. 

He described the requirements of the job, typical phone tasks. Read from the catalogue – never go off script. His prickled goatee wiggled around the phrase. Each plausible scenario deliberately described in a deep navy binder, edges curled from the last warm body. 

She only needed to say a handful of half convincing sentences before he offered the job – this part seemed less familiar.

After a few minutes, they both stood. She barely reached his chest, offering a firm handshake. The type that men like him usually respect. “It was a pleasure to meet you, Lana.”

…

The room smelled again of burnt coffee and disinfectant, this time in the back of a community center. She convinced herself to find it familiar, almost comforting. Maybe if she believed it long enough, it would lead somewhere else – a life with picket fences and a golden retriever. Two energetic kids clung to her legs. The husband came home, pushing open a bright yellow door. Maybe it's the holidays. Crooked mistletoe hung in the kitchen doorway. His hands settled at her waist. Burnt ginger and clove float around them.

Or that's just the smell of the room. 

She took her seat, the folding chair sagged like the depleted body it held. Her eyes scanned the room, searching for a familiar face, finding only the same blank stare. Dark eyes watching, waiting. 

The meeting began with voices that droned on, muffled to a buzz in the back of her head. The same stale air. The same tragic stories. The same boring meeting. 

An oddly shaped coffee stain marked the carpet. She shifted a little taller in her seat. “My name’s Leah, and I’m an addict.” 

They nodded on cue. 

…

A burning drag from her cigarette met her lungs. Obsessive fingers slam the numbers. Delete. Slam. Delete. The process repeats until she’s smoked it to the filter, stinging the sides of her fingers. 
	
She exhaled a plume from her nostrils as her thumb finally landed on the call button.
	
“Hi mom, it’s me.”
	
A pause lingered in the small apartment, mixing with smoke and incense. The old cracks in the wall mocked in hesitation. The metallic knocking from the radiator bounced into the receiver. 
	
Her mother’s voice sounded calm in a way that felt mistaken. She offered her usual whisper of hope. “I just want you to be okay.” 
	
She impulsively hung up before a goodbye. The line goes dead, leaving the room too quiet to move.

…
	
Life has always been an intricate dance with a fleeting sliver of light. She reaches out her hand, playing with the tiny specks of dust that float through the dark. Slow, gentle movements, careful not to chase them away. They drift through the air, only visible when the light hits just right. Her eyes trace each path, lulling her deeper into an eerie stillness. Entranced by the way things fall apart. 
	
Her thoughts spiraled around the room, eyes darting from one letter to the next, asphyxiating in their lengths. Pressure swelled, pushing outward through her body. 
If she could just get a hold of herself. But there lies a dark heaviness – deep, bleak, and warm. Latching around her body, chasing the light away. Her hands moved before her mind could orchestrate, wrapping the elastic around her arm. A gentle, sharp embrace.

The radiator screams, hissing steam. The pipes clang in argument inside the walls. Wooden shelves creak under their own weight. Floorboards complaining with every shift. The ceiling settles. Light fixtures buzz. The refrigerator clicks. The building breathes, uneven.

Just this once, she whispers her hollow promise.

The sliver of light escapes.

She always knew she’d make it here again.

After all, a leopard never changes her spots.

1pwmom6,https://i.redd.it/fgt6ywuqsn9g1.png,I Watched A Movie Nothing Lasts Forever (1984),"Don't be mistaken this isn't a James Bond knockoff movie nor is it the novel that Die Hard was based on ""Nothing Lasts Forever"" 1979.

This is a unreleased bad movie that was suppose to be a love letter to 1930- early 40s movies. Except they forgot to add a coherent plot to it. I don't even know what genre I would put this in. Sci-Fi when half the movie has Sci-Fi elements and the first half has none? Thriller? Comedy but there's barely any jokes?

The movie stars Gremlin star Zach Galligan, going to new york after a random man motivated him to work for his dream of being an artist. He goes to New York but is told he needs to pass an art test to draw a model woman. He fails the art test and is put to work as an overseer in tunnel traffic. Helps some bums on the street and 1 old man foreshadows that he will be famous, then starts dating the model woman from before. Then the old man who got a bread and coffee from Zach, shows him a secret world of people who control mankind and they need his help to bring love to the moon where he will meet his true love. You're indoctrinated into the spirit world, Zachey. The most infamous part then happens when Zach accidentally sneaks on to a Goverment project tour rocket bus to the moon. Then finds his space woman.

After hearing that crazy plot you start to understand why they didn't release it or have an official distribution of it. Which also ended SNL's director Tom Schiller's movie career.

Also Zach the main lead, looks as confused as I was watching this movie.

1pwmoev,https://www.reddit.com/r/Datingat21st/comments/1pwmoev/how_to_talk_about_sex_without_shame_the/,How to Talk About Sex Without SHAME: The Psychology That Actually Works,"grew up thinking sex was this forbidden topic you only whispered about after a few drinks. turns out, most of us did. we learned sex ed from outdated textbooks and porn, which is like learning to drive from Fast & Furious movies.

here's the thing though. after digging through research papers, books, and podcasts from actual sex therapists (not just random internet advice), i realized our collective inability to discuss sex openly isn't a personal failing. it's literally how we were conditioned. society treated sex like voldemort. ""the thing we don't name.""

but staying silent about sex creates way more problems than talking about it ever could. mismatched desires. resentment. fake orgasms. relationships that feel more like roommate situations. 

spent months researching this because my own communication around intimacy was honestly trash. here's what actually works.

## name what you want (specifically)

vague statements like ""i want more intimacy"" mean nothing. your partner can't read minds. 

* instead of ""i wish we had better sex,"" try ""i'd like to try having sex in the morning when we both have more energy""
* instead of ""you never initiate,"" say ""it turns me on when you text me during the day that you're thinking about me""
* specificity removes guesswork. the book Come As You Are by Emily Nagoski (she's a PhD sex educator and this book won basically every award) completely changed how i think about desire. she explains how desire isn't spontaneous for everyone. some people are ""responsive"" and need context and buildup. this book will make you question everything you think you know about how arousal works. insanely good read that explains why ""just be spontaneous"" is terrible advice for most people.

## separate the conversation from the bedroom

trying to give feedback during sex is like trying to teach someone to swim while they're drowning. timing matters.

* pick a neutral time when you're both relaxed. maybe during a walk or over coffee
* start with something positive first. ""i love when you do X"" before ""could we try Y differently""
* frame it as exploration, not criticism. use ""i want to explore"" instead of ""you're doing it wrong""
* the podcast Where Should We Begin with Esther Perel has incredible episodes on this. she's a couples therapist who's worked with thousands of couples. one episode breaks down how the way we ask for what we want determines whether our partner hears it as an invitation or an attack. game changer for understanding communication patterns.

## understand your own shame first

can't talk openly if you're drowning in shame yourself. most sexual shame comes from:

* religious or cultural messaging that sex is dirty or sinful
* gender norms (women who enjoy sex are ""sluts,"" men who don't want sex constantly are ""less masculine"")
* comparison to porn or social media's fake version of sex
* past trauma or negative experiences that haven't been processed

BeFreed is an AI-powered learning app built by Columbia University alumni that creates personalized audio content from top knowledge sources like research papers, expert interviews, and books. If shame around intimacy is something you're working through, you can literally tell it your specific struggle, and it'll pull from psychology research and expert talks to build you an adaptive learning plan. The depth is customizable too, anywhere from a 10-minute overview to a 40-minute deep dive with real examples. The voice options are surprisingly addictive, from a smoky, sarcastic tone to something calming before bed. It's been solid for replacing mindless scrolling time with actually understanding the psychology behind shame patterns.

The Body Keeps the Score by Bessel van der Kolk (he's basically the godfather of trauma research) explains how our bodies hold onto shame and trauma. it's not just mental. your nervous system literally remembers past experiences and reacts before your brain catches up. this is THE book on understanding why talking about vulnerable topics feels physically uncomfortable. won a Pulitzer nomination and completely reframed how i understand my own reactions.

## ask questions instead of making assumptions

most fights about sex come from assumptions. ""they're not attracted to me anymore"" when really they're stressed about work. ""they think i'm bad at this"" when they're just tired.

* try: ""i noticed we haven't been as intimate lately. what's going on for you?""
* or: ""how are you feeling about our sex life? is there anything you want more or less of?""
* curiosity beats accusations every time

## normalize awkwardness

talking about sex IS awkward at first. especially if you've never done it. that's normal. humans are weird about bodies and pleasure and vulnerability.

* laugh when things feel cringe. humor helps
* practice with smaller conversations first. talk about what kinds of touch you like generally (massages, holding hands) before jumping into explicit sexual preferences
* remember that every good communicator started as a terrible one

the YouTube channel Sexplanations with Dr. Lindsey Doe has hundreds of videos on sexual communication. she's a clinical sexologist who makes everything approachable and funny. her video on ""how to talk about sex"" walks through actual scripts you can use. super practical.

## check in regularly (not just when something's wrong)

waiting until you're frustrated to bring up sex makes it feel like a ""problem"" conversation. 

* try monthly check ins. ""how are you feeling about our physical connection this month?""
* make it routine so it's not scary. like how you'd check in about finances or household stuff
* the book Mating in Captivity by Esther Perel explores how longterm relationships kill desire and what actually keeps attraction alive. spoiler: it's not ""just communicate more."" it's understanding the tension between security and excitement. she's studied this across cultures for decades. this book is controversial because she challenges a lot of common relationship advice, but it's brilliant.

## understand consent is ongoing

consent isn't just for hookups. it applies in relationships too.

* check in during sex. ""does this feel good?"" ""want to try something different?""
* respect that someone can change their mind. always
* consent creates safety. safety creates better sex

the app Coral has research backed exercises for couples including communication tools and consent practices. actually helpful, not preachy.

## get comfortable with the words

if you can't say ""vulva"" ""penis"" ""clitoris"" ""orgasm"" without giggling or cringing, you're not ready for adult conversations about sex. 

* practice saying anatomical terms out loud until they feel normal
* use actual words instead of euphemisms with your partner. ""down there"" is for children
* the more you say the words, the less power shame has over them

## know when to get help

sometimes the shame runs too deep to work through alone. 

* if you have trauma history affecting your sex life, see a trauma informed therapist
* if you and your partner keep having the same fights, try couples therapy
* there's no shame in needing professional help. you'd see a doctor for a broken bone. your sexual wellbeing matters just as much
* the app Talkspace or BetterHelp can connect you with therapists who specialize in sex and relationships if in person therapy isn't accessible

here's the reality. we live in a culture that simultaneously hypersexualizes everything and refuses to have honest conversations about actual sex. we're surrounded by sex in media but terrified to ask our partner what they actually want.

that contradiction isn't your fault. but staying stuck in it IS a choice.

learning to talk about sex without shame is like learning any new skill. awkward at first. easier with practice. eventually becomes second nature.

your sex life won't magically improve from one conversation. but it definitely won't improve from zero conversations either.",1,1766803770.0,Datingat21st,0,1.0,False

She pays us rent on time, works full time, and is a responsible adult. We are grateful because we have heard nightmares of parents struggling with their adult child still living at home and acting like children. She is in her mid 20s and pays us $400 in rent every 1st on the month. Rent is always in an envelope on the coffee table by 6am on the 1st. Never have to ask for it. No matter how much she works, she always helps out with her baby brother and does her fair share of chores in the house. We never have to ask. She has good friends and makes good choices. 


So we decided to show how grateful we are and pay it back.

We gave her December rent back to her. Got her a new computer. Paid off her car, paid for new tires, and paid for a year of car insurance. Bought hair products,  makeup, clothes, socks, laundry detergent, her favorite snacks she splurges on and put it in a brand new hamper for her. And in her Christmas Card was a Costco *black* membership card.

Our daughter hugged us. Cried. We all cried. We told her how proud we are of the adult she has become and all that lovely dovey parenting stuff.

Our four year old son has us laughing by thinking it is just boring adult stuff. As he said  ""Tires? Why does she need tires? They are already on her car.""  He thinks he got the best Christmas gift because we got him a really big $100 dinosaur toy.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

i stopped drinking after a breakup when i was around 30. ive had one partner since then, but in the almost 4 years since i stopped drinking it has been so so hard to find people to date. not because theres no booze, but because the bar culture i used to meet people doesnt exist for me anymore. and yes, i have hobbies and a rich friend group and social life. its just not the same. my standards are higher too, and its about impossible to find someone to date. it makes the holidays feel extremely lonely.

its so hard to not want to drink so i can be ""normal"" and do what everyone else does and get what everyone else seems to get. i know in my heart thats not how it works, but i miss it so much. i miss splitting a bottle of wine with a new love, or having margs on a friday, or baileys and coffee at brunch. it feels like men arent interested in a woman who cant do these things. its just so disappointing. makes me wonder if my life is actually harder in this way because of my choosing to quit drinking, would it be easier if i just did? if i was normal? what am i even doing this for?

I’m Rza, 27. I’m a pretty masculine guy overall. I’ve been doing MMA for about a decade now and i love riding my motorcycle around, even in winter!! but lately I’ve been intentionally trying to get more in touch with my feminine/soft side and expand my world a bit.

Recently I’ve gotten into:

* Painting (still learning, but really enjoying it)
* Making music (making songs in DAWs)
* Reading a lot (I’m big on sci‑fi books/movies)

**What I’m looking for:**  
Strictly platonic friendship with people who have a more feminine vibe/energy (gender doesn’t matter. men, women, non‑binary welcome). If you’re in a relationship, that’s honestly a plus, because I’m not here for dating or anything romantic.

**Hangout ideas I’d love:**  
Coffee and a walk, bookstore/library hangs, a casual “paint at a café” session, swapping music and sci‑fi recs, or a low‑key movie night (public meetup first). I’m also open to group hangs if that feels safer/easier.

If this sounds like your vibe, DM me and tell me:

1. your age + general area, and
2. one thing you’re into lately (and your favorite sci‑fi book/movie if you have one).

No pressure. if we click, awesome. If not, all good. :)

Oh and I prefer downtown Vancouver for hanging out.",1,1766803228.0,Vancouver4Friends,1,1.0,False

I’ve been thinking about whether a small circle like this already exists — or if a few of us might want to shape something lightweight together.

Not a program, not a big group. Just a handful of people (maybe 4–6) who are already building something and want a bit of accountability and company along the way.

What I’m imagining (very open to shaping together):

• Quick weekly async check-in (what you shipped / what’s next)

• Optional virtual co-working

• Maybe the occasional coffee shop or library work session if it makes sense

• No single organizer — we rotate who nudges things along

Probably not a fit if you’re:

• Still at the idea stage

• Looking for a mastermind or pitch group

• Not actively building right now

If this resonates, I’d love to hear:

– What you’re building

– What stage you’re at

– Roughly where you’re based in the East Bay

Not trying to build anything big here — just momentum.",1,1766803111.0,eastbay,0,1.0,False

Had the perfect storm last night: CDiff positive patient with an ileostomy that he refused to empty himself. This also happened to be my first time encountering either of these since I started working independently. 

All precautions were followed religiously, I hand washed my hands to the bone after each time in the room, and I bleach wiped every piece of equipment on me before leaving (even the things otherwise covered with PPE). Stripped at the door and immediately threw everything in the washer while I went directly into a scalding shower. 

I lie down, thinking I’ve done it all right….then I wake up and have diarrhea after my morning coffee 🙃 haven’t had anything since besides from stomach discomfort but I’m chalking that up to too many Christmas leftovers.

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

1pwme2p,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucksbaristas/comments/1pwme2p/separated_from_starbucks_3_pls_give_me_some_advice/,Separated from Starbucks </3 Pls give me some advice,"I’m not sure who would be interested to read what I have to say but I was separated from Starbucks on Saturday December 20th. My manager mentioned that I would be sent a Separation Package for my sudden departure and I left without causing any problems as I was in a bit of shock and still wanted the opportunity to work at Starbucks again if I decided to give this company another chance. Tomorrow will mark a week since I’ve been separated but I have yet to receive my Separation package despite reaching out to Partner Care and my Manager mentioning that within 48 hours I should receive an email with information about the package and signing the documents. Is this something I should be worried about? I’ll try to make this as short as possible but I would like a few unbiased opinions on what happened.

At first it didn’t hit me right away as I was coming from a bit of a Euphoric high as I had taken 2 days off work to celebrate my birthday. I pulled into work as usual on the 20th and was ready to start my 6 hour shift. Did my coffee tasting and mentally was prepared for a busy day and busy week with the holidays and holiday pay coming. However a few minutes into my shift I was called into the BoH to have a conversation with my manager. He handed me the paper and communicated that I would be separated from the company, effective immediately and would have a few minutes to grab my things.

I had a feeling this would happen as I was on a final but heres a bit of context about the work environment I was in. Every single partner, even SSVs were on finals. We were getting written up left and right for every minor infraction and my Manager had separated 4 of our partners this year. A few of my partners had to transfer as his management style was affecting their finances and mental health.

I was told that I was being separated for violating the Attendance and Punctuality Policy. The exact infraction was accidentally no showing for an hour and a half as I slept in by mistake on November 19th. In the past however these separations were handed a week or so after the violation so I was on edge for a bit and had a conversation with my Manager and was believed to think that it was my final straw. A whole month passes and they so conveniently waited until the day after my birthday and less than a week before Christmas to officially separate me. Was it intentional? I’m not sure. But I do give my manager the benefit of the doubt that he was following orders from our DM as he’s been cracking down on a few things and being more by the book than usual.

They said that my separation wasn’t anything drastic and it truly is possible to be rehired but I’m not sure if I even would want to work at Starbucks again despite loving my job and loving my fellow partners.

What made me feel worse was having to say goodbye to whoever was on the floor and seeing all their faces changing as I said my final goodbye, even having them personally reach out was just so devastating.

1pwmclf,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1pwmclf/separated_from_starbucks_3_advice_wanted/,Separated from Starbucks </3 Advice wanted,"I’m not sure who would be interested to read what I have to say but I was separated from Starbucks on Saturday December 20th. My manager mentioned that I would be sent a Separation Package for my sudden departure and I left without causing any problems as I was in a bit of shock and still wanted the opportunity to work at Starbucks again if I decided to give this company another chance. Tomorrow will mark a week since I’ve been separated but I have yet to receive my Separation package despite reaching out to Partner Care and my Manager mentioning that within 48 hours I should receive an email with information about the package and signing the documents. Is this something I should be worried about? I’ll try to make this as short as possible but I would like a few unbiased opinions on what happened.

At first it didn’t hit me right away as I was coming from a bit of a Euphoric high as I had taken 2 days off work to celebrate my birthday. I pulled into work as usual on the 20th and was ready to start my 6 hour shift. Did my coffee tasting and mentally was prepared for a busy day and busy week with the holidays and holiday pay coming. However a few minutes into my shift I was called into the BoH to have a conversation with my manager. He handed me the paper and communicated that I would be separated from the company, effective immediately and would have a few minutes to grab my things.

I had a feeling this would happen as I was on a final but heres a bit of context about the work environment I was in. Every single partner, even SSVs were on finals. We were getting written up left and right for every minor infraction and my Manager had separated 4 of our partners this year. A few of my partners had to transfer as his management style was affecting their finances and mental health.

I was told that I was being separated for violating the Attendance and Punctuality Policy. The exact infraction was accidentally no showing for an hour and a half as I slept in by mistake on November 19th. In the past however these separations were handed a week or so after the violation so I was on edge for a bit and had a conversation with my Manager and was believed to think that it was my final straw. A whole month passes and they so conveniently waited until the day after my birthday and less than a week before Christmas to officially separate me. Was it intentional? I’m not sure. But I do give my manager the benefit of the doubt that he was following orders from our DM as he’s been cracking down on a few things and being more by the book than usual.

Yes I know that this easily could’ve been prevented with proper time management but I personally have gone through many burnouts throughout the year. I was sent to Phantom to other locations in my district, working 9+ days straight sometimes and still not cracking 40 hours some weeks and was promised lots of growth and development that was never implemented.

Also this is random, but when u get an iced drink theres a customer self serving area where u can get a straw, sugar ect. Even tho usually customers are meant to get a straw themselves, he always gets it and prepares it for me ontop of my cup so i dont have to do a thing- which isnt standard.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

My problem now is in a backdated version, there is no live Bethesda support, AKA no Creation Club items that I paid for. I had bought the Creation Bundle (mistake, I know now) on the new version before trying to port that Data folder containing the items to the backdated version. The game doesn’t even recognize it’s there because of the above problem.


I’ve tried a lot of swapping things and tweaking but the game refuses to recognize the CC content. It does however recognize my DLC and everything else extra. Am I screwed? Is my only option now really just to wait for mods to catch up the new version, if ever, to have my CC items?

1pwlkiu,https://productivitapp.com/,[$11.99 later. Free right now.] Early users get everything.,"Dear Redditor,

How much time did you spend “planning” today instead of actually finishing something?

How many tasks are still sitting there, untouched, mocking you?

I’ll show you the app to fix that in a moment.

But first…

Nothing irritates me more than productivity apps that:

* Make you build templates like you’re designing a spaceship
* Bury simple tasks under 47 features nobody asked for
* Feel productive while you do absolutely nothing
* Get deleted after a week because they’re painfully boring
* Promise focus, then quietly upsell you into spending hundreds just to feel functional

I got sick of it.

Maybe because I get distracted fast.

Every notification. One scroll. One “quick break.”

Suddenly the day’s gone.

I kept wondering how people finish work so easily.

Why they knock out tasks while I fight my own brain.

That’s why I blamed myself.

Maybe I’m broken. Maybe I lack discipline. Maybe it’s ADHD. Maybe it’s just me.

If that sounds familiar, listen carefully…

I couldn’t focus for ten minutes myself.

So I know the feeling. And here’s the part nobody tells you.

This mess may not be your fault.

Your attention gets attacked all day.

Social media trains your brain to crave novelty, comfort, and instant relief.

Most productivity apps make it worse by turning work into endless setup and fake progress.

Finishing tasks today is harder than it’s ever been.

My friend and I struggled with the same thing.

So instead of downloading yet another app, we built what we actually needed.

We learned to code. Got distracted along the way.

Drank too much coffee. Scrapped bad ideas. Kept what worked.

That’s how ProductivIT was born.

An app designed to help you finish tasks, not fantasize about being productive.

You don’t need to master templates.

You don’t need monk-level discipline.

You don’t need YouTube tutorials on how to use it.

Just download it for 5-10 seconds, finish tasks addictively, and see if it works for you.

Inside the app you get:

* An XP leveling system that tracks real work in real time
* Clear productivity stats that show what you actually did
* Distraction logs that expose what keeps pulling you away
* Eisenhower Matrix for decision clarity
* Simple to-dos and reminders
* Flexible focus timers you control
* Plus upcoming premium features unlocked for early users

Are there more benefits? Of course. 

I could go all day, but you probably get the gist already.

This app is new and that’s intentional.

Early members get full access while we build and improve it. Later users pay $11.99.

Now, I won’t pretend this app magically fixes your life.

You still need to show up.

But right now, you have three options:

Do nothing and watch time slip away and feeling behind.

Keep paying for apps that never stick.

Spend five seconds downloading something built for people who struggle to focus.

Why move now? Because once new members rush in…

We’ll start charging $11.99 for late users to keep the app going.

Take advantage of this.

Grab it while it’s free.

Tap the button below:

[https://productivitapp.com/](https://productivitapp.com/)

Download ProductivIT.

Try it for a few minutes and see how it feels.

Early users keep advanced features, including what’s coming next.

Kind regards,

ProductivIT 

P.S. Do you scroll at TLDR’s on reddit like me? Fear not, fellow human.

If you’re someone who used productivity apps that never stick…

For a small investment of $0 (for early users only), you get to download ProductivIT to make planning as simple as flipping pancakes and trigger focus-mode while working and actually finish tasks more than just planning them.

This free, once in a lifetime offer includes all the upcoming features people get who pay $11.99 if they’re late.

You don’t need to be another Notion expert or a disciplined monk.

All you need is ambition, a normal human brain, and actually showing up.

Be quick before tons of users fill in. The price skyrockets at that point.

So go ahead and download ProductivIT now and send me some feedback to see how it goes. It's totally free for you right now.

Just looking for some insight and direction as I’m just getting up to speed on MCA’s. I was diagnosed with adult onset food allergies and EOE in late 2019 after a whirlwind of issues and seeing multiple doctors. Eventually, I changed my diet and started on meds and things calmed down significantly. Fast forward to 2021 and after my Covid vaccine, I developed a litany of issues including migrating neuropathy, brain fog, headaches, dizziness, and vision issue. I pursued a lot of the basics with respects to treatment like ivermectin, LDN, etc but nothing ever made a dent. Given my already primed immune system and prior issues with histamine and allergies (including asthma), I’m wondering if this could be mast cell related in some capacity? I don’t have high tryptase levels but do have very high plasma histamine levels and high IgE serum and elevated IL-10. Also have skin issues like random rashes and random edema. The challenge is that I don’t get much relief from H1/H2 blockers (including cromolyn) beyond just basic help with my standard allergies. My current symptom pattern: much much worse in mornings and they are severely exacerbated by coffee. I also generally get better throughout the day and feel my best in the afternoons. Don’t notice much exacerbation due to heat beyond noticing skin issues and working out doesn’t seem to effect much. It may not be MCA’s at all but thought I’d lean on the group and see if anyone had any thoughts/opinions on what they think or what to look into. ",1,1766800523.0,MCAS,2,1.0,False

1pwliom,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1pwliom/i_killed_my_sister_for_clout/,I Killed My Sister for Clout,"I still have the playlist we made on my phone. It is mostly trash 2000s pop and some indie bands she found on TikTok. We used to drive around for hours in my beat up Honda just listening to it. That was our thing. We would go to the drive thru at Wendy’s, get two Frosties, and just drive until the gas light came on.

Katie was cool. She was not just my sister. She was the only person in the house who actually got it. Our parents were fine, I guess. They loved us. But they were old and tired. They were the kind of parents who fell asleep on the couch at 8 PM and worried about the lawn more than anything else. Katie and I were a team. When I snuck out to go to that bonfire sophomore year, she stuffed pillows under my duvet to make it look like I was sleeping. When she failed her math final, I intercepted the report card in the mail and we burned it in the backyard fire pit.

We looked out for each other. We were stuck in the same boring suburb, going to the same boring school, dealing with the same boring people. We survived by making fun of everything. We had a running commentary on the world. If we saw someone wearing a weird hat, we would look at each other and just know what the other was thinking. We didn’t even have to say it.

That is why what I did makes no sense.
I look back at it now and I try to find a reason. I try to find some deep dark anger or some hidden resentment. People always want a reason. The therapists I talk to now, they always dig for some childhood trauma or some sibling rivalry. They want a story where I secretly hated her.

But there is nothing. It was just a random afternoon.
Katie had been talking about this guy, Alex, for months. She was obsessed. She wrote his name in her notebook. She knew his schedule. She knew what car he drove. It was honestly kind of pathetic but in a cute way. She was sixteen. She had never really had a boyfriend. She had this idea of romance that she got from movies. She thought Alex was this deep, mysterious soul just because he wore a leather jacket and didn’t talk much in Chem lab.

I knew Alex. He wasn’t deep. He was a stoner kid who played COD until 4 AM. But I didn’t tell her that. I let her have the fantasy.

That afternoon, we were sitting in the living room. She was talking about him again. Wondering if he noticed her new shoes. Wondering if he liked girls with curly hair.

I was bored. That is the only excuse I have. I was bored and I was scrolling on my phone.

“I wish I could just talk to him,” she said. “But I don’t have his number.”

The idea popped into my head fully formed. It wasn’t malicious. It was just… something to do. A way to interrupt the boredom.

“I think I have his number,” I lied. “I think he was in a group project with me last year.”

Her eyes went wide. “Really? Do you still have it?”
“Let me check,” I said.

I didn’t have his number, obviously. I opened the app store and downloaded WhatsApp. I set up a fake account using a burner number app. I set the profile picture to a grainy shot of a guitar I found on Google Images. Alex played guitar. Or at least he carried one around.

I created the account. I named it Alex.
Then I looked at Katie. She was staring at me, practically vibrating with hope.

“Yeah, I found it,” I said.

“Give it to me,” she said.

“No, that is weird,” I said. “If you text him out of the blue, he will think you are a stalker. Let me text him. I will tell him you are cool. I will tell him to text you.”
She looked at me like I was a superhero. “You would do that?”

“Yeah,” I said. “I got you.”

I typed a message into the WhatsApp account. I sent it to her real number.

>Hey. Got your number from your brother. He said you’re cool. I’m Alex.

My phone buzzed in my hand as I sent it. Her phone buzzed on the coffee table a second later.
She picked it up. She read the screen. Then she screamed.

She literally jumped up off the couch and screamed. She hugged me. She squeezed me so hard I couldn’t breathe.

“He texted me!” she squealed. “He actually texted me!”

I should have stopped it there. I should have said “Gotcha” and laughed and taken the punch to the shoulder. It would have been a funny story. We would have laughed about it at Wendy’s later.

But I didn’t. I just smiled. It felt good to be the one making things happen. It felt good to see her so happy, even if it was fake.

“That is awesome, Katie,” I said. “What did he say?”
She showed me the phone. “He said you told him I was cool.”

“Well,” I said. “I did.”

The next twenty four hours were a blur of texts. I was texting her from the bathroom. I was texting her from my bed. I was texting her while sitting right next to her on the couch.

It was too easy. I knew exactly what she wanted to hear. I knew she liked indie music, so ‘Alex’ liked indie music. I knew she wanted someone to listen to her talk about her art class, so ‘Alex’ asked tons of questions about her sketches.

I was catfishing my own sister. And the sick part was, I thought I was being a good brother. I thought I was giving her a confidence boost. I told myself that when I revealed the prank, she would see that she could talk to guys. That she was interesting.

By Friday afternoon, she was in deep. She was walking around with a goofy smile on her face. She was humming.

“He wants to meet up,” she told me Friday night. She was standing in my doorway. “He wants to grab a burger tomorrow.”

I had sent that text five minutes ago.

“That’s cool,” I said. “Are you going to go?”
“I don’t know,” she said. “I’m nervous. What if I say something stupid?”

“You won’t,” I said. “Just be yourself. He already likes you over text, right?”

“Yeah,” she said. “Yeah, he does.”

I set the trap. I picked the diner on Main Street. The one with the neon sign that flickered. It was public. It was safe. It was the perfect stage.

“I can drive you,” I offered. “Since mom and dad are going to that dinner thing.”

“You are the best,” she said.

She went to her room to pick out clothes. I could hear her opening and closing drawers. I lay back on my bed and opened WhatsApp.

>Can’t wait to see you

, I typed.

>Me neither

, she replied instantly.

I laughed. I actually laughed out loud. It was just so easy.

Saturday came. The mood in the house was electric. Katie spent two hours in the bathroom. She borrowed Mom’s perfume. She came into my room to show me her outfit.

She was wearing this blue dress she bought with her babysitting money. It had little white flowers on it. She had curled her hair. She was wearing lip gloss.
She looked older. She looked pretty. She didn’t look like my annoying little sister. She looked like a young woman going on her first real date.

“Do I look okay?” she asked. She was twisting her hands together. “Is it too much? Should I change?”
“You look great,” I said. And I meant it. “Alex is going to flip.”

“I hope so,” she said. She took a deep breath. “Okay. Let’s go.”

We got in the car. I plugged in the phone. I put on the playlist.

She was singing along to everything. She was tapping her hand on the dashboard. She was glowing.
I drove to the diner. I pulled into the lot across the street.

“Go get him,” I said.

She unbuckled her seatbelt. She turned to me.
“Thanks,” she said. “Seriously. Thanks for talking me up to him.”

“No problem,” I said.

She got out. She walked across the street. She walked with her head held high. She looked confident.

I watched her walk through the glass doors.
I waited five minutes. I wanted her to get settled. I wanted the anticipation to build.

Then I pulled out my phone. I opened the camera app. I hit record.

I got out of the car.

I crossed the street. I was smiling. I was rehearsing what I would say. Gotcha. Look at your face. You are so gullible.

I walked into the diner. The bell above the door chimed.

I saw her immediately. She was sitting in the third booth. She was facing the door.

She had a menu in front of her, but she wasn’t reading it. She was checking her reflection in the napkin holder. She was fixing her hair.

She looked up when she heard the bell.

Her face lit up when she saw me. It was pure, unfiltered joy. She thought I was there to check on her. Or maybe she thought I was there to say hi to Alex.

“Did you see him?” she asked as I walked up. “Is he parking?”

I didn’t lower the phone. I zoomed in on her face. I wanted to catch the exact moment the realization hit.

“He is not coming, Katie,” I said.

She blinked. “What? Is he running late? Did he text you?”

I shook my head. “No. He didn’t text me.”

I held up my phone. I switched from the camera app to WhatsApp. I showed her the messages. The blue bubbles. The grainy guitar picture.

“It was me,” I said. “I’m Alex.”

I waited for the laugh.

I waited for the punchline. I waited for her to grab a french fry and throw it at me. I waited for her to say, “You ass” and roll her eyes.

But she didn’t.

The smile didn’t turn into a frown. It didn’t turn into anger. It just vanished. It fell off her face like a mask slipping.

She looked at the phone screen. Then she looked at me. Then she looked around the diner. There were a few other people there. An old couple in the corner. A trucker at the counter. No one was looking at us. No one cared.

But she looked like she was naked on a stage.
She shrank. Physically shrank. Her shoulders hunched up. She crossed her arms over that blue dress with the white flowers. She looked like a little kid who had been told Santa was dead.

“Why?” she whispered.

It was such a quiet question.

“It was just a joke,” I said. The camera was still recording. “Smile. It is just a prank.”

She tried to smile. She actually tried. Her mouth twitched. It was the most heartbreaking thing I have ever seen.

She didn’t say anything else. She just slid out of the booth. She walked past me. She walked out the door.
I followed her. “Katie, come on. Don’t be dramatic.”
She got into the car. She stared out the window.
I got in the driver’s side. I was annoyed now. I felt like she was ruining the bit. I felt like she was being a bad sport.

“It was funny,” I said as I started the car. “You fell for it so hard.”

She didn’t answer. She didn’t put her seatbelt on. She just stared at the passing streetlights.

I drove home in silence. The playlist was still playing, but she wasn’t singing anymore.

When we got home, I uploaded the video. I captioned it “She actually fell for it.” I tagged a few of our friends. I wanted validation. I wanted people to tell me it was funny so I didn’t have to feel the weird knot forming in my stomach.

Katie went straight to her room. I heard the lock click.

I went to my room. I refreshed the feed. The likes were rolling in. The comments were starting.


>“LMAO look at her face.”


>“That is brutal.”


>“Bro you are evil 💀”


I felt better. See? Everyone thought it was funny. It wasn’t a big deal.

I knocked on her door around 10 PM.

“Come on,” I said through the wood. “Don’t be a baby. Everyone thinks it is hilarious.”

She didn’t answer.

I woke up the next morning because the house was too quiet.

Usually on Saturdays, Katie was up early. She would be in the kitchen making pancakes or blasting music while she cleaned her room. But there was nothing. No sound.

I looked at my phone. The video had over a thousand views. People I didn’t even know were sharing it.
I got up. I went to the bathroom. The door was locked.

“Katie?” I knocked. “Hurry up. I need to pee.”
Nothing.

“Katie, seriously. Open the door.”

Silence. A heavy, pressurized silence that made my ears pop.

I got a penny from my dresser. I used it to turn the lock from the outside.

The door swung open.

Katie was on the floor.

She was curled up around the toilet. She was still wearing the blue dress.

There were empty blister packs everywhere. Tylenol. Advil. My dad’s old prescription painkillers for his back. The box was torn open. The foil was punched out.

I laughed at first. A short, sharp bark of a laugh.
“Okay,” I said. “You got me. Good one. Get up.”

I nudged her leg with my foot.

She didn’t move. She was heavy. Stiff.

I knelt down. I touched her arm.

It was cold. Not cool from the tile. Cold. Deep, radiating cold. Like touching a piece of frozen meat.
I grabbed her shoulder. I tried to shake her.

Her head didn’t flop. Her neck was rigid. Her jaw was clamped shut. Her eyes were open, staring at the porcelain of the toilet bowl. They were cloudy.

I don’t remember screaming. But I must have, because my mom was suddenly there. Then my dad.
My mom made a sound I didn’t know a human could make. It wasn’t a scream. It was a raw, animal howl. She fell to her knees. She tried to pull Katie up, but the rigor mortis had set in. Katie was frozen in that curled up shape.

The paramedics came…

Moving her was the worst part. Because she was stiff, they couldn’t just put her on the stretcher. They had to maneuver her down the narrow hallway. They had to tilt her to get her through the doorframe. It felt disrespectful. It felt like they were moving a mannequin, not a person.

I stood at the top of the stairs and watched.
I had killed my sister. I had killed her for likes. I had killed her because I was bored.

The house died that day.

My parents stopped speaking. They stopped eating. They moved through the rooms like ghosts, avoiding eye contact with me. They didn’t blame me out loud. The police ruled it a suicide. A tragedy. An impulsive act by a teenager.

But they knew and I knew.

The video was gone. I deleted it that afternoon. But it was too late. People had seen it. People knew.

The funeral was three days later.

It was an open casket. I wished it hadn’t been.
By then, the stiffness had passed. She looked… soft. Too soft. The mortician had used too much makeup to cover the gray. Her cheeks were too pink. Her lips were a weird, waxy orange.

It didn’t look like Katie. It looked like a doll that someone had melted and tried to reshape.

I stood by the casket and tried to cry, but I couldn’t. I just felt empty. I felt like there was a hole in my chest where my heart used to be.

After the funeral, the silence took over. It wasn’t peaceful. It was heavy. It felt like the air in the house was made of lead.

I stopped sleeping. I couldn’t close my eyes without seeing her face in the diner.

I missed her. I missed the car rides. I missed the playlist. I missed my teammate. I missed the only person who understood me.

I started spending my nights sitting in the hallway outside her room. I couldn’t go in. I couldn’t look at the empty bed. So I just sat against the wall and stared at the door.

That is when the sounds started.

It began about three weeks after she went into the ground.

I was dozing off, my head resting on my knees.

Ding.

My head snapped up.

It was the specific, tri tone chime of a WhatsApp notification.

I checked my phone. It was silent.

Ding.

It came from inside her room.
My heart began to beat like a drum. I knew her phone was in the evidence box at the police station. I knew the room was empty.

But the sound was there. Clear as day.
I stood up. My legs were numb. I reached for the doorknob.

I opened the door.

Her room smelled like dust and that cloying floral perfume she had worn that night. The bed was made. The desk was clear.

Ding.

The sound wasn’t coming from a device. It was coming from the corner of the room. From the shadows between the wardrobe and the wall.

“Katie?” I whispered.

The shadow moved.

It didn’t look like a ghost. It didn’t look like her. It looked like a smudge on a camera lens. A blur of darkness in the shape of a person. It was taller than she was. Darker than the dark around it.

It didn’t speak. It just waited.

I should have run. I should have woken my parents. But I was so tired. I was so full of this rotting, black guilt that I just wanted something to happen. I wanted to be punished.

“Are you there?” I asked.

The shadow didn’t answer. But a thought appeared in my head. It wasn’t my voice. It sounded flat. Hollow. Like wind blowing through a pipe.

“Undo”, it whispered.

“Undo.”

The word echoed in my skull. It wasn’t audible. It was bouncing through my own mind, a thought that was not my own.

I fell to my knees on her carpet. “I want to,” I sobbed. “I want to undo it. I just want things back to normal.”
The shadow seemed to expand. It filled the room with a cold that burned my skin. It wasn’t the cold of the air conditioning. It was the same cold I had felt when I touched her arm on the bathroom floor.
Normal, the hollow voice said. ""We can do normal. Open the door."" 

“How?” I asked. “Tell me how.”
The door is already open, the voice droned. You opened it when you called for her. You just have to invite her back in.

I wiped my face. I looked at the shadow. It didn’t have eyes, but I could feel it watching me. It felt like something. I can’t even explain what it felt like. But I didn’t care.

“What do I do?”

Tonight, the voice said. Unlock the back door. Call her name. Want it.

“Is it that easy?” I asked.

You have to want it more than you want to be safe, the voice said.

I nodded. I did. I wanted it more than anything.
I spent the rest of the day in a daze. I watched my parents sit at the dinner table and push peas around their plates. They looked gray. They looked like they were waiting to die.

If I brought her back, I could fix this. I could fix them.
Night fell. The house went dark. I waited until I heard my parents’ bedroom door close. Then I went downstairs.

I unlocked the back door. I turned off the porch light. I sat on the kitchen floor and waited.

Wyatt, our golden retriever, came into the kitchen. He was a good dog. Dumb as a bag of rocks, but loyal. He trotted over to me, his tail wagging.

But then he stopped.

He looked at the back door. His ears went back. His tail tucked between his legs.

He started to whine. A high, pitiful sound.
“It is okay, Wyatt,” I whispered. “She is coming home.”

Wyatt didn’t look at me. He backed away. He kept backing up until he hit the cabinets, then he bolted into the living room. I heard his claws scrambling on the hardwood.

I sat alone in the dark.

Around 3 AM, I heard it.

Knock. Knock. Knock.

It wasn’t a hand. It sounded hard. Like bone hitting wood.

I scrambled up. My hands were shaking so bad I could barely grip the handle.

I threw the door open.

The backyard was pitch black. It was raining. A cold, steady drizzle.

Katie was standing on the patio.

She looked… small.

She was wearing a thick gray hoodie I recognized. It was my old one. She had the hood pulled up tight. She had a wool scarf wrapped around the lower half of her face. She was wearing gloves.

She was shivering. Violent, jerking shivers that rattled her whole body.

“Katie?” I whispered.

She didn’t look up immediately. She just stood there, vibrating in the rain.

Then she stepped inside.

She moved stiffly. Like she was so cold her joints had locked up. She looked like a little girl who had been out in the storm for too long.

“Katie, it is me,” I said.

I reached out to hug her.

She felt solid. She felt real. But she was freezing. It was like hugging a snowman wrapped in cotton.
She didn’t hug me back. She just stood there, her arms pinned to her sides.

“You are freezing,” I said. I pulled back to look at her.
The hood shadowed her eyes. The scarf covered her mouth and nose. All I could see was the bridge of her nose. The skin looked pale, but it was dark in the kitchen.

“It is okay,” I said, crying now. “You are home. I fixed it. I fixed it.”

She nodded.

I led her to the living room. She walked with a weird limp, dragging her left leg a little, but I told myself it was just the cold. She sat on the couch, staring straight ahead.

“I missed you so much,” I said. I sat on the coffee table in front of her. “Mom and Dad are going to be so happy.”

She didn’t answer. The house smelled funny. Like wet dirt and something sweet, like old fruit. I figured it was just the mud on her clothes.

“Say something,” I pleaded. “Please.”

She made a sound. It was muffled by the scarf. It sounded like a dry wheeze.

“Hungry,” she whispered.

My heart broke. She sounded so weak.

“Hungry? Okay. I will get you something. I will make you whatever you want.”

I ran to the kitchen. I was manic with relief. She was here. She was talking. It worked.

I pulled out ham, cheese, bread. I started making a sandwich. I was humming. I was actually humming.
Then I realized something.

It was quiet.

Wyatt usually came running when he heard the cheese wrapper. He was obsessed with cheese.

“Wyatt?” I called out. “Come here, boy.”

Nothing.

I finished the sandwich. I put it on a plate.

“Wyatt!” I whistled.

Silence...

A cold feeling started in my stomach. Not the good cold of relief. The bad cold of fear.

I walked into the hallway. “Wyatt?”

The door to the basement was cracked open. Wyatt wasn’t allowed in the basement.

I walked over. I pushed the door open.

“Wyatt, get out of there.”

I turned on the light.

At the bottom of the stairs, there was a heap of golden fur.

It wasn’t moving.

I walked down the stairs. My legs felt heavy. “Wyatt?”
I got to the bottom step.

It was Wyatt. But he was… something wasn’t…right…
He was torn open. His stomach was gone. His ribs were cracked open like a wishbone. There was blood everywhere. It was pooled on the concrete.
It wasn’t an accident. Something had done this. Something strong.

I heard a creak on the stairs behind me.
I spun around.

Katie was standing at the top of the stairs.

The hood was down. The scarf was gone.

Her face was gray. Her jaw was hanging loose, unhinged on one side. Her mouth was stained red. With blood.

She was holding the sandwich I made her. She crushed it in her gloved hand and let it drop to the floor.

“Still hungry,” she rasped.

I backed up until I hit the washing machine.
“Katie?” I choked out.

She walked down the stairs. She didn’t walk like a person anymore. She moved like a spider, her limbs jerking and snapping into place.

She stopped at the bottom. She looked at the dead dog. Then she looked at me.

Her eyes were milky white and sunken in.

“You did this?”  I whispered.

She tilted her head. Her neck cracked.

“Empty,” she said. Her voice was wet now. “So empty.”

“What are you?” I screamed.

“Your sister,” she said. But the way she said it was wrong. It was like she was mimicking a recording. “You wanted me back.”

“Not like this,” I said. “I didn’t want this.”

She took a step towards me.

“You owe me,” she hissed.

It wasn’t a threat. It was a plea. She looked at me, and for a second, the milky film over her eyes seemed to thin. I saw brown underneath. I saw panic.

“It hurts,” she whined. She sounded like a little kid. “It hurts so much. I am so hungry. I am so angry.”
“How?” I asked, trembling. “What do you need?”
The shadow peeled itself off the basement wall. It stood next to her, tall and jagged.

“She needs the source”, the voice droned. “She is running on fumes. She needs the fuel that burned her out.”

“Me?” I asked.

Katie nodded. She reached out a hand. The glove had fallen off. Her fingers were gray and withered.

“Please,” she whispered. “Let me eat. Then I will be whole. Then I will be Katie again.”

I looked at her. I looked at the dog.

“If you eat me,” I said. “You will kill me.”
“Yes,” she said. “Exchange. A life for a life. You took mine. Give it back.”

She stepped closer. I could smell death on her breath.

“I can’t be like this,” she cried. “It is cold. It is dark. Please, brother. Help me.”

She was using my guilt. She was reaching right into my chest and squeezing my heart. She knew exactly what to say.

“If I let you,” I said. “Will you remember?”

She paused. She licked the blood off her lip.

“Yes.”

I looked at her. Really looked at her.

If I let her eat me, I wasn’t saving her. I was cursing her. I was forcing her to live with the memory of tearing her brother apart. I was turning her into a monster forever just so I didn’t have to feel bad anymore.

“No,” I said.

Her face twisted. The sadness vanished. The hunger snapped back into place.

“Give it to me!” she shrieked.

She lunged.

She hit me hard. We fell onto the concrete floor. She was strong. Unnaturally strong. Her hands pinned my shoulders. Her jaw unhinged even further. Her mouth was a cavern of red teeth.

She snapped at my face. I turned my head. Her teeth clicked inches from my ear.

“Katie, stop!” I yelled. “Look at me!”

She drew back to strike again.

“I am sorry!” I screamed. “I am sorry I wasn’t a better brother!”

She froze.

She hovered over me, dripping saliva onto my shirt. She looked down at me.

The hunger flickered. The brown eyes came back. She looked at where her hands were pinning me down. She looked at the dead dog in the corner.
She realized what she was.

She rolled off me. She scrambled into the corner, away from me. She curled into a ball, hiding her face.
“Make it stop,” she sobbed. “Please. Make it stop.”
The shadow hissed. Do not listen to her. Feed her.
“No,” I said.

I stood up. I looked around. My dad’s old tool bench was next to the dryer.

I grabbed a long screwdriver. It was rusty, but the tip was sharp.

I walked over to Katie.

She looked up. She saw the screwdriver.
She didn’t run. She didn’t fight.

She uncurled her legs. She opened her arms. She exposed her chest.

“Do it,” she wheezed.

I fell to my knees in front of her. The smell of rot and dog blood was overwhelming.

“I love you,” I said. “I tried. I really tried.” I whimpered out with tears rolling down my cheeks.

“I know,” she whispered. Her voice was clear. No rasp. No hunger. Just Katie. “It is okay.”

I put the tip of the screwdriver against her chest.

I pushed...

It was hard. Her skin was like leather. I had to use both hands. I had to put my weight into it.

She gasped. Her back arched. Her hands grabbed my arms, but she didn’t push me away. She pulled me closer.

“Thank you,” she breathed.

Then she went heavy. The tension left her body. She slumped against me.

The shadow screamed. It was a sound like a siren dying. Then the basement light flickered, and the room was empty.

I sat there on the cold concrete, holding my sister’s body, waiting for the sirens.

That was three years ago.

I spent two of those years in a state facility. The doctors called it a psychotic break. They said I dug her up to say goodbye. They said I killed Wyatt because I couldn’t tell the difference between life and death anymore.

I let them believe it. I took the pills. I nodded when they talked about “processing grief.” It was easier than trying to explain the shadow man in the basement.

I’ve been out for a year now. I live in a different state. I have a job stocking shelves at a grocery store on the night shift. It’s quiet. I like the quiet.

My parents don’t talk to me. I don’t blame them. To them, I’m just the monster who dug up their daughter.

I’m writing this because I need to ask a question. I need to know if I’m the only one.

That shadow… I don’t know what it was. It wasn’t a ghost. It wasn’t Katie. It was just something bad.
It didn’t leave because I won. I didn’t win anything. It left because the show was over. It got what it wanted. It wanted to see how far I would go.

But where did it go?

I look at people now. I see the tired lady buying frozen dinners at 3 AM. I see the guy sitting in his car in the parking lot, just staring at the steering wheel. Everyone has something they regret. Everyone has a moment they want to undo.

I wonder if it’s watching them too.

I wonder if it’s standing in the corner of your room right now, waiting for you to get desperate enough to open the door.

If you are reading this, and you have a heavy heart… if you hear a voice that sounds like your own thoughts offering you a way to fix things…

Don’t listen.

Just live with the guilt. It sucks, and it’s heavy, but at least it’s yours.

At least it doesn’t eat you",19,1766800463.0,nosleep,0,0.91,False

This got me greenlit from my so to search a new machine. I said I wanted to switch to an espresso machine. She does drink milk coffees and she liked our nespresso creatista plus for the convenience of auto frothing. The frothing was good enough for her. So this is a must have.

I got her as far as willing to learn the basics of the tamping etc, to wich i’m also new but eager to start learning.

My current pick that i gathered after a lot of reviews and searching came down to this:

I've seen the country change so much, all new highways and buildings, I was even here when the corniche had roundabouts instead of traffic light junctions. I even remember the huge traffic party on the corniche when Qatar won the world cup host bid like it was yesterday, I was there. Time has gone so fast. 

Nearly most of my life I've been here now, its a nice place. I've never even made a single real friend here apart from the people I see day to day at work, gym, workers in supermarkets etc but I wouldn't call them real friends, they are not people I go out with for coffee / cinema etc. Never gotten married, never even had a girlfriend here, Im pretty much a loner haha. I wake up and just do my own things what I want to do every day. I was just wondering is there anyone else like me here? ",7,1766800278.0,qatar,1,1.0,False

This is third time in 3 days when we argue over things that don’t make sense to me, and 90% of the times she yells a lot about it, and it drives me nuts. 

I’ll give an example: I went to the gym at the same time as her(different gym) and after gym, I went to a caffe to meet with a friend unplanned, she called me when she finished, I told her and he hung up the phone, saying that I should’ve told her, even though I was there for 30 minutes. 

Another example is that we bought a coffee machine together as a Christmas present for our home, and then when I told her that I ordered the accessories online without asking her opinion on those, she got offended and pissed about it. 

I have 100 more examples, and every time she’s mad - she expects empathy and compassion from me, but I cannot give her that because I don’t think that there’s anything wrong in the first place. 

She seems agitated and angry at me almost every day, she got mad because I was on my phone for literally 10 seconds (checking the calendar to see what day her father’s bday is) while we were buying presents for her niece the other day, and got all rage over it, even though she was doing the same thing for 10 minutes 2 weeks before, and my response was - “Honey, I would appreciate if you don’t use your phone while we are at the mall.”

I love her, but I am tired of constant yelling, fighting and that there’s “something wrong with me”

Do I really need to be more empathetic and try to give validation to her feelings or she’s squeezing the soul out of me? 

After we fight, she doesn’t want to agree with me that she is agitated, she cries and even did self harm once while we were fighting out of nowhere (she was hitting herself in the head)… she says that the only thing that would make this work is that I need more empathy, validation of her feelings, sorry from here and there and we would be good, but I feel like if I do that, she would be offended by everything and I would be sorry about anything every single day. 

Last note - she’s highly disagreeable person by nature, and I’m agreeable person, and I try to avoid conflicts in general. Maybe the only conflicts that I do are the ones with her though. ",1,1766800271.0,relationships_advice,1,1.0,False

Edit: spoiler alert I just pulled the trigger already lol

I’m new to all this. Been drinking filter coffee for 20 years. Come at me.

Been doing my research for a couple weeks. Started from just asking around what good machines are, to deciding i want to have separate grinder and machine instead of an all-in-one model.

Have done some research on espresso machines but less so on grinders. Actually thought burr grinder was a typo for bean grinder less than a week ago..

Anyhow. Latest moves were looking up European sellers for DFxx grinders. Who sells in the Netherlands or what deals there are.

\*But just saw a Eureka Mignon Specialita for €200 instead of the €400 for all other colours. Saw a lot of happy owners on this sub, but also people upgrading from it.

Is that a ‘buy now don’t question it best bang for buck’ deal? For me, a beginner with a budget. Or are there cases to be made to not pull the trigger and choose a different option?

Budget for grinder + machine preferably as low as possible but still kick ass treat myself gear. Like it’d be great to stay \\\[under €1000  combined\\\]? (Looking at Lelits and Gaggia’s and Sage/Breville and Rancillio, but that’s for a later post. But that might mean the grinder to be under the \[€500\] range)?

Deciding to take the espresso step has meant a LOT of new information. Kinda feels like going back to school. Haven’t even looked into what all the portafilter details mean and single dosing and timing shots and weighing.. I was about to dive into all that.

Until i saw this probably temporary deal for that Specialita.. So priority question. Will delete this post when the deal’s gone. It’s probably an awful post to read lol.

Just bought it. If any other Dutchies happen to be online, it's on [bol.com](http://bol.com) only the Chrome version has massive discount for some reason, guessing just this 1 day as a buitenkansje deal",1,1766800116.0,espresso,5,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.

tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

1pwle01,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1pwle01/a_guest_wanted_a_coffee_without_paying_for_it_and/,A guest wanted a coffee without paying for it and yelled at me when I said no. Am I overreacting?,"To give some backstory, I (21 M), work at a relatively busy hotel in a small city in Norway. I am currently working the last shift of my nightshift-week, and I have been thinking about this situation relentlessly since then. It happened at around 04:00 AM, just a few days before Christmas eve. I was in the kitchen preparing the cold and dry foods for the breakfast that was going to open a few hours later. I was therefore *not* in the reception when the guest in question came to ask for a coffee from the reception coffee maker. On the reception desk there is a sign letting the guests know that the night receptionist is in charge of preparing the breakfast, and that we may not always be in the reception. He did not see the sign and got angry at me when I did not immidiately assist him. This, however, was not the moment I got angry or anything like that. I don't blame the guests for not seing the sign as it can be easily missed, even by the most alert person. I apologized for not being in the reception, which was then followed by a light scoff from the guest. I asked him what I could help him with, and he told me that he would like to *purchase* a coffee. I am underlining his use of the word 'purchase', because it is important to the end of the story. Anyway, he then told me that he wanted a black coffee, to which I put the order in the terminal. He then proceeds to ask me if he can pay for the coffee later, to which I say 'no'. He is immediately taken aback by my response, and says that my reluctance was ""bad service"". At this point I am annoyed, and frankly baffled by the fact that he asked me to give him a product without paying to then immiditately give me crap about it. I paused for a moment, and then told him that the same premise would apply to other products at other stores. For example, you wouldn't ask a convenience store worker to 'pay later'. I realise that he's only asking for a coffee but I was not going to bend the rules for him, especially after the attitude he gave me. He then asks me if I can put it on his room. We can record and encrypt payment cards on their profiles, but the banks of certain payment card companies can refuse the payment request by the hotel. Therefore, we are not allowed to 'put it on the room'. I respond with a simple 'no'. I then ask him if he has a payment card that he can purchase the coffee with on the terminal in the reception, to which he replies 'yes' and that it is in his room. I remind him that he has to buy the coffee before I can give it to him, to which he once again scoffs at me. He then tells be that this was the worst hotel experience he had ever had. I said that I was sorry (I really wasn't). He then turns around and heads for the elevator. At this point I am feeling a lot of emotions, but ultimately conclude that the whole situation didn't have anything to do with me, as I was only doing my job.

The clock is now 04:15 AM, and the guest returns with a payment card in his hand. I immidiately take his payment, make the coffee and kindly tell him to enjoy. I thought that I should try to diffuse the whole situation by killing with kindness. I never tell guests to enjoy the coffee: I simply smile or nod after giving it to them. Crickets. He responds with nothing, and simply returns to his room. I am once again baffled by the fact that this man (who looked to be about 30-40-ish years of age) was acting like a complete toddler. Nevertheless, I once again remind myself that some people are like that, and that I - as a mere receptionist - really can't change the way this man navigates life. After this, I continue preparing the breakfast as if nothing happened.

The clock has now turned 05:00 AM, and the man returns. I am in the cantine, preparing the ice-wells and making the filter coffee for the breakfast. The elevators are stationed next to the cantine, so I see him the second he comes down to the lobby. I greet him again, with a smile, to which he responds ""You know, I am a member"". I am instantly reminded that member guests have coffee included in their booking, and that he should not have payed for the coffee I made him. He reminds me of this, to which I apologize to him. He does not respond, and simply leaves the hotel without even checking out of his room. At this point I am fuming. It felt like he was rage baiting me, and I fell for it all three times that he came to me in the reception. The last thing he said was in every way valid, and I recognize that I should have asked him if he was a member of the hotel. However, slash, comma, HE asked me if he could PURCHASE a coffee. My mind, at the time, then assumed that he was in fact not a member. This made me even angrier. My reflection is that if you had any form of coupon, voucher or membership benefits, you don't ask to PURCHASE them. This, to me, seems redundant, and the way the situation concluded really angered me.

Nevetheless, I am here seeking different viewpoints. Am I overreacting? Should I have trusted that he return and pay for the coffee, or did I do the right thing refusing him?",1,1766800089.0,AmIOverreacting,3,1.0,False
1pwlds4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pwlds4,Need Advice/Help [La Marzocco Linea Micra + Eureka Silenzio 50mm],"Merry Christmas everyone!

I'm using LaMarzocco Linea Micra with Eureka Silenzio 50mm, converted into a single dose with an angled stand, hopper, etc.

I ordered 2kg of Uganda beans from Angry Roster. I usually try multiple beans at the same time, but when I first tried Uganda beans last year from somewhere else, it was so good, I still remember the taste, and since their beans are from the same area, I wanted to give them a try and ordered a big batch this time. But unfortunately, my grinder doesn't grind fine enough to get a proper shot. I believe the beans are on the lighter side. I also didn't have any problems with a medium roast. I had medium roast beans before this one, and everything was so good, and the coffee was so tasty!

I cleaned my grinder completely yesterday and installed a King Size dial as well. I calibrated it and found the correct zero point. I’ve already wasted six 18 g doses of beans, but unfortunately, even when I tried grinding at the actual zero, the extraction and the coffee were still very bad. My attempts are listed below; all of them consist of 18 g of coffee.

\- VST 18g Basket with 0.2mm Puck

\- VST 18g Basket with 0.8mm Puck

\- VST 18g Basket without Puck

\- La Marzocco 17g Basket With 0.2mm Puck

\- La Marzocco 17g Basket Without Puck

And the extraction time was between 11 and 14 seconds. The coffee was roasted on **December 12.**

I'm planning to buy a Mazzer Philos, but not soon; I need a couple more months.

My main question is, what can I do to make a proper espresso with my current grinder without wasting more beans? Increasing the dose in the same basket, 20g in an 18g basket?

I have a hand grinder, but don't want to deal with it all the time because our daily consumption is around 5 double espressos, so it'll not be convenient. Also, it's been dialled into a drip, don't want to change it.

I’m a 36-year-old guy from New England, and like a lot of people here, I’ve never been in a relationship. It wasn’t for lack of trying — shyness, bad timing, and life just kept getting in the way. But I’ve been working on myself, opening up more socially, and I’m genuinely ready to connect with someone.

A bit about me:
Firstly I have some sort of fame, if thats what you call it. I made a dating site promoting my singleness DatingKen.com which caught news in Boston and Matt Sheer a reporter social media. I’m a huge nerd who loves conventions, gaming, and cosplay. It’s been an amazing community for me, and I’ve met some great friends through it. I cosplay characters like Eddie Munson from Stranger Things and Leon from Resident Evil. I stay active, take care of myself, and oddly enough, I’m freakishly lucky with raffles and giveaways (no clue why, but I’ll take it).

I’m looking for someone kind, patient, and down-to-earth. You don’t need to cosplay — just be someone who enjoys nerdy stuff or at least doesn’t mind it. I’m not expecting perfection; I just want a genuine connection with someone who understands what it’s like to navigate dating later than most.

If you’re local, maybe we could start with something simple like coffee. No pressure — just two people seeing if there’s a spark.

Quite enjoyed it, especially the little touch of cardamom that settles with you about 20 to 30 seconds after you swallow. Felt like a riff on a Vieux Carre, to me, but what do I know? So I thought I’d reach out to The Reddit cocktail crowd to see if there are any guesses on re-creating this at home?

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

There have been some wins: I rejected the initial constant asking to babysit my newborn when he was literally days old, ignored when MIL wanted to do a pretend happy family photoshoot with them for her Christmas card, baby-hogging days are over where she'd clutch my son for hours & lastly, we did not drive to my in-laws Christmas morning as they wanted (pre-baby years we did). Next wack-a-mole session of stupidity coming up .. 

We went there for a couple hours Christmas afternoon. This was my compromise after my husband said he absolutely had to see his family on Christmas day. We spent the morning starting our own traditions, in our pajamas, etc. During the visit to my in-laws, there was notable tension between MIL & I. She was trying to assert dominace 100%. She is having a hard time understanding I don't answer to her, especially when it comes to my baby. She's not my matriarch or can call the shots for my primary family. I said how it's important to respect the wishlist & moms of young kids know best what they'll need/utilize, etc. She was not having it. ""Well I like to go off-list"" she stated in a bratty tone. She was flippant & doesn't give an F about my list. I also find it manipulative that she gave a $300 check -- so I can buy some items they didn't get, I'm told. In other words, I'm told what to do with the gift money. She got my son some onesies, which I don't need from getting tons of hand-me-downs (she knows this, didn't care). And she bought a crinkle book -- but of course NOT one on my list. She bought a very close duplicate of one he already has, a farm theme. I wanted the jungle one for him to enjoy. As a baby, sure he won't really care but if he was 3 or 4 I'd imagine he'd be disappointed in duplicate gift from grandparents, right? It's stupid. I know she thinks I'm controlling. To make me more pissed, she also ignored my list for myself & only got 1 item from it.. I got a bunch of random sh** I'll never use, like smelly citronella sticks, high acidity coffee grounds I can't have with IBD & fire emergency blanket. Really? But if I bitch, I'm the ungrateful scapegoat.. considering making a post on FB that the crap is for sale. My FB obsessed MIL would definitely see. 😇

Also considering handing the check back to her next time I see her & say, hey this wasn't a gift. It had strings attached that I had to use it for gifts you couldn't handle buying for myself or my son. It's a bizarre power struggle dynamic & I don't want your money. I want a non-manipulative MIL.

Im agitated. I see this being a bigger issue in the future with clashing at Christmas on competing with gifts for my son (they're wealthy, money is no object). It's the principle of it that she doesn't care what I have to say.. Just like when they tried to bypass our boundaries when my son was born. Am I overreacting?

The February sun warmed the window of the Barefoot Cat café when Valeria realized she was dozing off over her sketchbook. She had spent three hours trying to capture the perfect shape of a weeping willow, but every stroke came out crooked, as if her hand refused to obey her.



""Again?""

The voice startled her. Looking up, she saw a boy with black hair and green eyes standing across from her table, a cup of coffee in his hand, his expression a mixture of surprise and amusement.



""Excuse me, am I bothering you?"" she asked, quickly closing her sketchbook so he couldn't see her.



""Quite the opposite, this is my favorite table,"" he said, leaning slightly forward. ""But it seems you've taken over everything with your crooked strokes.""


Valeria blushed to the tips of her ears. ""They're not crooked. They're... abstract.""


The boy laughed, a clear laugh that cut through the murmur of the coffee. ""Sure, abstract. By the way, I'm Leo. I study music at university.""


""Valeria. I study graphic design."" He stared at his black shoes, so clean against the café's cement floor.


""Look, if you want, I'll share the table with you,"" Leo said, sitting down without waiting for a reply. ""And I'll buy you another coffee, because yours's gone cold.""


Before Valeria could refuse, she was already heading to the bar. When she returned, she brought two cups of coffee with milk and a chocolate pastry.


""To liven up the abstract strokes,"" she said, placing the pastry in front of her.


While they drank their coffee, they talked about everything and nothing: the classes they hated, the songs they listened to all day, how much they loved looking at the stars from the rooftop. Valeria realized she wasn't nervous, something that never happened with anyone else. Leo listened attentively, his green eyes fixed on hers, and every time he spoke, he made her laugh at silly things.


Until suddenly, while gesticulating wildly, Leo knocked over Valeria's cup. All the coffee spilled onto her sketchbook.


""Damn it! I'm sorry, I'm so sorry,"" he said desperately, searching for napkins. ""I got carried away, I don't know what happened..."" Valeria looked at the sketchbook: the pages were soaked, the lines fading into brown smears. But instead of getting angry, she laughed.


""It doesn't matter,"" she said, pulling out a wet page. ""They were just crooked lines anyway.""

Leo stopped, napkins in hand, and smiled at her: a big, genuine smile that made her heart flutter.


""Then,"" he said, ""maybe you'll come back tomorrow and I'll help you draw straighter lines. With more coffee, and this time, without knocking over the cup.""

Valeria nodded, her face red. ""Sure. Tomorrow.""

As she left the cafeteria, Valeria stuffed the wet sketchbook into her backpack. She didn't care that it was ruined, because now she had something more important: the promise of seeing Leo again. And maybe, this time, the lines would come out right.",1,1766799111.0,WatpadStories,0,1.0,False

I wanted to share a tool/setup that has massively helped reduce my daily ""mental load"" while juggling J1 and J2.



We all know the stress of stepping away from the desk (to grab coffee, switch laundry, or just breathe) and imagining that J2 is blowing up with ""Are you there?"" messages.



I use a \*\*PiKVM\*\* setup to access my J2 laptop (keeps it totally isolated/safe), but I hated having to constantly ""watch"" the screen stream.



To fix this, I built a Chrome extension that acts as a second set of eyes.

It uses \*\*OCR (text reading)\*\* to watch the video stream of my J2 laptop in the browser.

If it sees ""New Message"" or a specific keyword (like my name), it alerts me immediately.



\*\*The best part:\*\*

I set up a \*\*webhook to Discord\*\*, so I get the notification right on my Apple Watch/Phone.

Now I can actually step away from the desk with peace of mind, knowing that if something urgent happens, I'll essentially get a ""page"" on my wrist.



It’s called \*\*PiKVM Watcher\*\* (I put it on the Chrome Web Store).

It processes everything locally (privacy first, video never leaves your house), and there's a free version that covers the basics.



Hope this helps someone else reclaim a bit of sanity!

Based on the official event listing for **Thursday, January 1, 2026**, the plunge is set for **9:00 AM** at the **Jacksonville Beach lifeguard station** area.

**What you can plan around:**

*  **Date:** Thursday, January 1, 2026
*  **Time:** 9:00 AM
*  **Where:** Beach near the **Jacksonville Beach lifeguard station** / **SeaWalk Pavilion** area
*  **Cost:** Historically **free** and **family-friendly**
*  **Who’s involved:** The City of Jacksonville Beach has partnered with groups like **Wavermasters** in recent years 

**Where it happens: SeaWalk Pavilion + the lifeguard station zone**

When we talk about “the Jax Beach Polar Plunge,” we’re usually talking about the main public beach access by **SeaWalk Pavilion**, right in the heart of Jacksonville Beach.

Gather **adjacent to the lifeguard station and Joe’s Crab Shack**, a super easy landmark even if you’re not a Beaches regular.

  
Other coverage references the plunge being held at **SeaWalk Pavilion**.

If you’re bringing friends, don’t overcomplicate it. Pick one meetup anchor:

* “Lifeguard station by Joe’s” (simple)
* “SeaWalk Pavilion beachfront” (also simple) 

**What time to arrive**

Yes, the plunge is at **9:00 AM**.  
No, you should not roll in at 8:55 and expect a calm, cinematic entrance.

A smarter plan:

*  **8:00–8:20 AM:** Park + walk over + find your people
*  **8:20–8:50 AM:** Warm up, sip coffee, take your “I’m about to do this” photos
*  **9:00 AM:** Plunge 

Why arrive early? Two reasons:

1. A lot of people show up. Like, a lot.
2. The vibe before the plunge is half the fun. 

**Parking tips that will save your morning**

Parking can be the difference between “Best New Year’s ever!” and “I spent 45 minutes circling while my toes went numb.”

**Free parking at the city lot next to Sneakers Bar & Grill** and that the plunge itself is free/open to the public.  
Even if you don’t land that exact lot, arriving early gives you options.

Our strategy:

* Aim for public lots first (they fill, but they turn over) 
* If you’re late, park farther out and treat the walk as your warm-up 
* Don’t block driveways or ignore signage, Jax Beach will absolutely tow on a holiday 

**What to wear for a polar plunge in Florida**

For 2026, our meteorologist estimated **water temps around 60°F**, with air temps in the 40s.

Here’s what works:

# Before the plunge

*  A **big hoodie** or **robe** 
*  **Wool socks** \+ **slides** (or any easy on/off footwear) 
*  A **beanie** (wind off the ocean is sneaky cold) 

# During the plunge

* Swimsuit, obviously 
* Optional: a thin rashguard top if you want a little coverage 

# After the plunge (this is where you win)

*  **Two towels** (one for you, one for your future self who is still wet) 
* **Dry clothes you can change into fast** 
*  **A blanket** in the car 
* **Thermos of something warm** 

**Safety: how to do this without turning it into a medical drama**

This is a fun community event. Treat it like one.

*  If you have heart/respiratory concerns or you’re unsure, **talk to a clinician first**. 
* Don’t “tough it out” if you start feeling dizzy or panicky. Get out. Warm up. 
* Keep an eye on kids. The ocean doesn’t care that it’s New Year’s Day. 
* Avoid making this an extension of New Year’s Eve partying. Cold water + dehydration is not a vibe. 

**First-timer game plan**

If you’ve never done a polar plunge, the hardest part is the 90 seconds before you go in.

**Try this:**

1. Pick a buddy and agree you’re going in together. 
2. Walk down to the waterline and pause. Breathe. 
3.  Go in **fast**, not slow. Slow is torture. 
4. Get waist-deep, take the moment, then come out. 

And yes, almost everyone says the same thing after: going in is one thing, coming out is the real shock.

**Why Jacksonville Beach keeps doing this every year**

Because it’s become a real tradition.

Coverage has described it as a community event that’s been running **for decades**, drawing both veterans and first-timers.

It’s also the kind of wholesome chaos Jacksonville does well: strangers cheering for strangers, lots of laughter, and that one person who shows up in a costume like it’s mandatory.

You’ll leave with salt in your hair, sand in your shoes, and a weird amount of pride.

Not bad for 9:15 AM on January 1.

**FAQs: Jacksonville Beach Polar Plunge 2026**

**Is the Jacksonville Beach Polar Plunge free?**  
Yes, it’s **free** and **family-friendly**.

**What time is the polar plunge in Jacksonville Beach?**  
**9:00 AM**

**Where do I go?**  
Look for the beach area **near the Jacksonville Beach lifeguard station** and the **SeaWalk Pavilion / Joe’s Crab Shack** landmarks.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

This is third time in 3 days when we argue over things that don’t make sense to me, and 90% of the times she yells a lot about it, and it drives me nuts. We are dating for 3 years now. 

I’ll give an example: I went to the gym at the same time as her(different gym) and after gym, I went to a caffe to meet with a friend unplanned, she called me when she finished, I told her and he hung up the phone, saying that I should’ve told her, even though I was there for 30 minutes.

Another example is that we bought a coffee machine together as a Christmas present for our home, and then when I told her that I ordered the accessories online without asking her opinion on those, she got offended and pissed about it.

I have 100 more examples, and every time she’s mad - she expects empathy and compassion from me, but I cannot give her that because I don’t think that there’s anything wrong in the first place.

She seems agitated and angry at me almost every day, she got mad because I was on my phone for literally 10 seconds (checking the calendar to see what day her father’s bday is) while we were buying presents for her niece the other day, and got all rage over it, even though she was doing the same thing for 10 minutes 2 weeks before, and my response was - “Honey, I would appreciate if you don’t use your phone while we are at the mall.”

I love her, but I am tired of constant yelling, fighting and that there’s “something wrong with me”

Do I really need to be more empathetic and try to give validation to her feelings or she’s squeezing the soul out of me?

After we fight, she doesn’t want to agree with me that she is agitated, she cries and even did self harm once while we were fighting out of nowhere (she was hitting herself in the head)… she says that the only thing that would make this work is that I need more empathy, validation of her feelings, sorry from here and there and we would be good, but I feel like if I do that, she would be offended by everything and I would be sorry about anything every single day.

Last note - she’s highly disagreeable person by nature, and I’m agreeable person, and I try to avoid conflicts in general. Maybe the only conflicts that I do are the ones with her though.

That’s why they called him Big John. He was being baptized late by Lotharite standards, but there were circumstances involved. Well, one circumstance, that being his mother was unable to walk for several months after his birth. But now here he was, being carried to the baptismal font at the First Lotharite Church of New Winnweiler (Heidelberg Confession). Dressed in a custom baptismal gown, you see, as Big John was nearly seventeen pounds… they call him Big John for a reason.

Big John was held by his parents, both lifelong Lotharites. The pastor dressed in a robe and stole poured water over the crown of Big John’s head three times, baptizing him in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. There was no applause, the baby’s head was patted dry and he was about to be carried away so that the service could proceed with scripture reading.

But then it happened.

No one quite understood what was going on as a booming voice rang out “Una forte Rocca e il nostro Dio!” Big John sang in perfect pitch, in the voice of a tenor, in precise Italian. The congregation looked around for speakers, for someone with a microphone. As Big John continued the hymn, the ears of the congregants led their eyes to the baby at the baptismal, who was in fact belting out the Lotharite anthem. There were gasps, shouts of praise which were more common among other types of Protestants, and the grinding of teeth. Well, there was just one person grinding her teeth. But who could be bothered by this sudden outpouring of miraculous talent?

Lauren Stromberg. That’s who.

Lauren Stromberg was a joy to be around. Tall, physically imposing, severe; she directed the choir of the First Lotharite Church of New Winnweiler (Heidelberg Confession) like a drill sergeant. Big John’s voice was simply amazing, but Lauren immediately identified several problems: there were no hymns during a baptism, spontaneity was simply out of the question, and that sounds like… Italian? Too exotic for a Lotharite (Heidelberg Confession) service.

“Il regno suo rimane per l’eternita” Big John held the ending note to the hymn in a bold display of lung capacity. The stunned crowd, some standing, some having fainted, were held in a breathless pause for a brief moment after Big John had concluded the one-song performance. But then they erupted in ecstatic applause. Well, not quite everyone. Actually, everyone except one person.

Lauren Stromberg.

The pastor announced an unscheduled intermission to the service so that everyone could regain their composure. What a buzz the crowd, mostly older folks, were in!

“He must be the reincarnation of Pavarotti!” Lauren heard one woman say.

“What a beautiful language! Why don’t we sing in Italian more often?” Said another. Lauren’s eye twitched when her brain registered that one.

“The miracle of tongues!” Suggested someone else. Oh boy, someone was in need of a reminder of Maxmillian Lothar’s teachings on the acts of the Apostles, and how they had ceased in the first century. It’s in the Heidelberg Confession.

A hurried service resumed after a few minutes, the pastor referring to the impromptu song from a 58-day old child as a “miracle” definitely ground Lauren’s gears. She was stoic as she directed the choir through a well-rehearsed closing hymn. A watchful eye on Big John, who had fallen asleep in his car seat, half-expecting another disturbance during the approved, English-language hymn. Despite the chaotic energy delivered by Big John, the hymn went as planned.

As you may imagine, everyone wanted to see Big John after the service. To quiz his parents, who were as in awe of the event as anyone else, to see him, to touch his little, well… it’s a relative term, hand. Lauren Stromberg intercepted the pastor as he was on his way to see if he could score an audience with Big John.

“Pastor Ludendorfer.” She halted him. “I think it’s appropriate for you to issue a correction to the congregation.

The pastor was accustomed to being stopped by a congregant while he was walking, but this bold interception irked him. He composed himself, masking his frustration as best he could. He wanted to gawk at Big John with everyone else, not pacify Lauren Stromberg in whatever nitpicky complaint she had.

“Thanks for bringing it to my attention. A correction about what though?”

“People are saying that the interrupting, I mean singing, baby, is the reincarnation of some opera singer. Maxmillian Lothar taught quite clearly that reincarnation was incompatible with reformed faith. The Heidelberg Confession clearly outlines”

Pastor Ludendorfer raised his hand and nodded in acknowledgment.

“Yes, I understand. That teaching is very clear. I think sometimes when people are excited they speak without thinking. Whoever said that probably meant that Big John sounded like an opera singer. He does though! Wasn’t that amazing? I have never heard anything like that! He sang like an angel!”

Lauren glared at him, making several mental notes.

“It wasn’t one person; it was several people. I think it requires correction.” She insisted, physically barring Pastor Ludendorfer from passing. She only permitted him to access Big John, who he had to chase (which was easy, Big John didn’t even crawl yet, but his stroller did move quickly), after he had acquiesced to her stern demand masked as a suggestion.

The usual crowd was on time for church the following Sunday. This was not unusual as they were mostly retirees (they were Lotharites after all, I think the average age of the congregation was late sixties). Most were still unhappy with the recent change to a 9 am service, they preferred the original 7:30 start time. Some grumbled that the young Pastor Ludendorfer was being influenced by Pentecostals with the late service. Anyway, the point here is that they were extra motivated to be on time to see if Big John would return this Sunday with his parents. He did. Everyone was so excited to see Big John being strolled in, well almost everyone. Actually only one person wasn’t excited to see Big John.

Lauren Stromberg was not excited to see Big John.

She rolled her eyes so hard that a weaker woman would have hurt her neck. But Lauren was a powerlifter, her squat game was a little weak though. She snapped the choir to attention and began directing them in the opening hymn at exactly 9 o’clock. They had finished the first verse, but the crowd was looking to the back pew, eyes fixed on Big John.

This was going too well, Lauren knew it was too early to relax. As the second verse began, the choir was overpowered by a familiar voice, louder than the choir with all their powers combined.

“Santo, santo, santo! Tutti i santi t’adorano,

deponendo le corone davanti al trono tuo”

Big John sang as beautifully, and as Italian as he had the week before.

The crowd gasped, the choir stopped, Big John continued.

Lauren snapped.

She rapped her conductor’s baton on the music stand and commanded them to begin on the chorus. A few complied, the others stood marveling at Big John’s holy serenade. The organ continued playing, well, organ sounds continued. The congregation did not have an organist, not since Mrs. Gewurztraminer had moved to an assisted living facility last year. The musical accompaniment to the hymn was played from a popular video sharing application.

There was applause when the song ended. There was never applause after a hymn, well, unless Big John just sang it, in Italian.

Boy was this a great introduction to Pastor Ludendorfer’s ten-minute sermon.

“What a wonderful gift we’ve been given, to hear this little one praise the name of our Lord with his beautiful voice. But in our joy, we must be careful to speak the truth. We’re called to remember the clear teachings of scripture, clarified by Maxmillian Lothar, and codified in the Heidelberg Confession. A soul exists in Earth once before judgement. The idea that the soul of anyone who has passed into eternity could come back into a different body is well outside our understanding of the afterlife as outlined in the Heidelberg Confession… and scripture.”

The time for the closing hymn approached. Lauren held out her hand, stopping the choir from approaching. The congregation was confused, there was nothing in the Heidelberg Confession about this.

“There is no need to follow centuries of order and tradition, the little newcomer will just sing for us.”

A cascading gasp spread through the crowd in reaction. Some looked at Lauren in disbelief, others looked back at Big John in anticipation of his next lovely song. Pastor Ludendorfer, with a still-active lapel microphone (and boy was he aware of that since the “burp incident” of 2023), interrupted.

“Choir, could we please have you come to the chancel for the closing hymn?”

They reluctantly resumed their progress. Lauren glared at Ludendorfer furiously. He meekly avoided her intense glare and felt genuine fear.

The organ was a bit delayed in starting, but after it began (well, after someone hit the play button on their phone app) the choir was immediately overpowered by little baby Pavarotti in the back of the church.

“Incoroniamo di corone,
L’Agnel sul Suo splendor!”

The congregation sighed with relief, the choir provided an English backing to the hymn, Lauren stormed out.

No one really noticed her leaving, though she marched down the center aisle and out the main door.

After the congregation was dismissed, they gathered around and fawned over Big John much as before. Pastor Ludendorfer patiently waited for an audience with the silent infant, though his joy was stolen by the looming threat of Lauren Stromberg, with whom he knew an unavoidable encounter loomed.

Michael Wolfgang Ludendorfer snuck out of the church with the main body of departees, highly irregular. He normally listened to the elderly, who were his primary audience, tell him about their prescription medication after a Sunday morning service; but today, he was fleeing from his choir director.

Her car was still in the parking lot! In a mild panic, he hurried to his own car and fled the parking lot while the church was still half full, or half empty, depending on your perspective.

Lauren was already down the road, only a few hundred yards away at the historic Saint Jakob Railroad Park. It consisted of two benches, a tree, and a decommissioned railroad bridge that spanned 38 feet across the Alsenbach Creek. For over seventy years it was used to supply the mill which had polluted the creek, which tragically caught on fire in 1966. The creek caught on fire, not the mill.

Anyway, the cruel November wind blew wisps of Lauren’s hair from her orderly braid as she looked through the dead shrubbery of the embankment down at the barely moving water of the famed creek. She stood in solemn, silent contemplation at the foot of the bridge. Her life’s work had been overshadowed by a spectacle… in Italian no less.

Lost in thought, her situational awareness was also lost.

“You okay there Miss?”

She gasped, spinning around startled to see a sharply dressed gentleman standing a respectful distance away.

Lauren didn’t recognize the man, which was odd for New Winnweiler. Even if she didn’t know someone, she typically at least recognized them. Perhaps he was a visitor and had just come from church. Maybe he saw her leave and followed. That made sense to Lauren.

She took a deep breathe to compose herself. Her cheeks and nose were red from the cold, but she hadn’t shown any indication that she had been crying, because she hadn’t been.

“Yes. I’m fine.”

“It’s not a very high bridge, you know.”

Lauren’s face betrayed her internal reaction, even if her words were measured.

“It was high enough to get corn to the mill for over 70 years.”

The stranger sucked in his lips and nodded, looking past her at the bridge.

“Sure was, but it’s not for corn anymore. I don’t think it’s high enough for much else though.”

“What are you implying?!” Lauren sharply responded, alarmed at the inference.

The man held his palms up toward her as if to deescalate.

“Just thought I’d check and see if you were alright. It’s not too common to see a lady in her Sunday best on a bridge staring at the creek.”

Lauren knew that the stranger knew, her eyes downcast as she deliberated whether or not to tell this seemingly kind person her troubles.

“It’s that singing baby, isn’t it?” He asked.

“I was hoping it was my imagination. But that fat baby really does interrupt the service, doesn’t he?” Lauren blurted, seeking validation. He must have seen her leave the service, she told herself.

“I can help you with the baby.” The stranger said, taking a step forward.

Lauren’s head tilted, warily eying the man and instinctively putting her hand on the pepper spray bottle in her pocket. Lauren pepper-sprayed someone at least once a month.

“I can elevate your choir. I can silence the baby. I can even help you to out-sing that baby. In Italian, heck, even Latin if you”

Lauren’s eye twitched at the suggestion she sing in Italian, and Latin was the final straw.

“We must avoid and shun all idolatry, sorcery, superstitious rites, and invoke the one true God only!”

She quoted the Heidelberg Confession. And that serpent of old, Satan, the Devil, was overcome.

Well, either that or the blast of pepper spray that Lauren delivered to his eyeballs from inches away. He held his jacket over his eyes as he fled blindly into traffic to be hit by a freelance delivery driver. Lauren was in hot pursuit but veered away as the stranger lay mangled in the street and jogged lightly to her car in the church parking lot.

I am going to out-sing that fat baby. Lauren thought to herself, dabbing her forehead with a napkin as she sat in her car. She grabbed a fresh bottle of pepper spray from the glove box and replaced the used can in her pocket.

Pastor Ludendorfer’s heart skipped a beat the next morning when he arrived at the First Lotharite Church of New Winnweiler (Heidelberg Confession) and saw Lauren Stromberg’s car in the parking lot.

He spoke the words of Maxmillian Lothar aloud, but quietly as he exited his vehicle and walked, slowly, to the church.

“Dear God,

Protect me from sin, error, and unsolicited theological corrections.

Grant me the swiftness outlined in the Heidelberg Confession Article 17, Note B,

where it says to flee evil swiftly,

Guard my tongue,

strengthen my spine,

and conceal me if possible.

Amen.”

An angelic voice greeted him from the sanctuary as he entered. Lauren Stromberg was in front of the chancel, where she was accustomed to directing the choir from, singing beautifully. Maybe not quite as beautifully as Big John, but quite nicely at least.

Pastor Ludendorfer chose wisely to not interrupt Lauren’s solitary practice and went about his normal Monday morning business.

Lauren trained like a Navy SEAL… of singing, all week. Each day her voice grew shakier, more hoarse. But she refused to coddle her vocal cords. She would defeat Big John fair and square, or she would die trying.

She barely slept Saturday night, and rather than fighting vainly against consciousness, she rose early and prepared herself for battle.

“Rrrrrroll your Rrrrrrs for the Lorrrrrrd!” She woke her tired vocal cords, compressing her sore diaphragm with her fists. She was as ready as she ever would be.

The first at church, she analyzed the acoustics from her position against those of where the fat baby sat with his parents. Too bad Lotharites don’t believe in church nurseries, she thought, this could have all been avoided. But Lauren was never one to back down from a fight, not even a fight with a fat baby.

It was 8:58 am when Big John’s parents strolled into church. So much for the virtue of punctuality extolled in the Heidelberg Confession. Lauren had already been there for hours, to the prepared goes the glory, that’s what Maxmillian Lothar had said.

The organ music announcing the opening verse Be Still My Soul. All eyes turned to Big John, who was sitting smugly, according to Lauren, in the back pew with his parents and their contraband coffee.

Lauren unveiled her secret weapon. No, not pepper spray, although she had considered it. A microphone, which she held to her mouth and sang into, competing with but not overpowering Big John as he began singing.

“Sii calma, o cuor,

confida nel Signor”

Many, but not all, eyes turned to Lauren, who had never before used a microphone while directing the choir. Lauren’s voice cracked, then it squeaked. She threw the microphone down with a horrible amplified crashing noise as Big John continued the hymn. She ran, undignified, unlike the week before, through the crowded church, pepper spraying Michael Wolfgang Ludendorfer in the eyes with alarming precision as she ran from the church straight to the historic Saint Jakob Railroad Park. Steam escaping her mouth in the cold morning air, still over Alsenbach Creek, as she gazed down to the water which seemed to call to her.

The Sun broke through the dark clouds, and she felt like it was shining just on her as a warm gust blew up the embankment from under the bridge.

“Devil?” She called out. “I need you now!”",1,1766798359.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

I've never worked with yeast before but I did a lot of googling to make sure I didn't kill it, is it just underdone? Its usually a denser bread, but not like this.. 

for reference I baked it at 375f for 30 minutes, and it looked done + the top was getting too crispy for normal pulla. It looks pretty bad but I don't know if that is because of the gluten free flour or if i overkneaded it.

It tastes okay, I'm assuming its still edible...",0,1766798315.0,Breadit,2,0.33,False
