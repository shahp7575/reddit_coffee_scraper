Or before it comes back.

Three weeks ago, I bought a new VR game called *Valorantis: Total Immersion Warfare*. Neural interface. Full sensory feedback. The kind of thing tech influencers call “the future of gaming.”

I live alone. Work remote. I don’t really do much outside of that. I figured why not.

It took maybe fifteen minutes to set up. The headset came with this slim neural band that sat at the base of my skull. The instructions said the system would “stimulate immersive response patterns.” Which is marketing-speak for “we’re about to hijack your brain.”

I lay back on my couch and hit start.

That’s the last normal memory I have.

When it began, I was standing in a desert.

Not a rendered desert. Not something that looked like a game.

It was hot. Blindingly bright. I could feel the sun baking the back of my neck. Sand scraping against my lips. Sweat pooling under body armor I didn’t remember putting on.

I looked down.

Rifle in my hands. Camouflage sleeves. Gloves.

Someone shoved me from behind.

“Move, Dale!”

Dale.

I tried to say, “My name’s not-”

What came out instead was: “Copy.”

And I moved.

Gunfire erupted seconds later.

The sound wasn’t like speakers. It was concussive. It punched through my chest. I dropped instinctively as an explosion went off close enough to rattle my teeth.

Someone next to me screamed. I turned and saw blood soaking into sand.

It smelled metallic. Real.

He grabbed my vest.

“Don’t let me bleed out.”

I remember thinking: this is too much.

There had to be a menu. A pause button. A log-out gesture. I blinked hard, trying to summon an interface.

Nothing appeared.

Just war.

Time doesn’t work normally in there.

I don’t know how to explain it.

I remember missions. Plural.

Desert operations. Urban night raids. Jungle deployments where the air was so thick with humidity I felt like I was drowning just by breathing.

I remember names.

Rivas. Ortiz. Kessler.

I remember their faces better than some of my own relatives.

Rivas was the squad leader. He had this scar under his eye and this steady way of talking, even when bullets were snapping past us. He died during an urban sweep. Sniper round straight through the visor.

He dropped without drama.

I screamed his name.

It echoed in a way that still wakes me up.

At some point, I stopped trying to leave.

That’s the part that scares me the most.

I tried at first. I really did. I’d whisper “log out” before sleeping in whatever tent or barracks we were assigned. I’d slap my own face, hoping I’d wake up on the couch.

But the pain was real.

The exhaustion was real.

When Ortiz stepped on an IED in the jungle, I was close enough to feel pieces of him hit my face.

There wasn’t enough left to bury.

I didn’t throw up that time.

I just stared.

Something inside me hardened after that.

You adapt. That’s what humans do. You adapt to survive.

So I adapted.

I learned to clear rooms properly. Learned how to move through tall grass without giving away position. Learned how to shoot without hesitating.

And I stopped thinking about my apartment.

It started to feel like a childhood memory.

Fuzzy. Unimportant.

There was a moment that changed everything.

We were in some burned-out village. Concrete shells of buildings, smoke drifting through broken windows.

I found a photo pinned to a wall.

It was me.

Not “Dale.”

Me.

Standing in my apartment. Same couch. Same coffee table.

Behind the photo, carved into the wall, were the words:

YOU CAN’T LEAVE UNTIL IT’S OVER

I told myself it was part of the game’s psychological design. They probably scraped data from somewhere. AI-generated environment manipulation.

But I never gave them access to my apartment.

And the photo angle, it wasn’t something posted online.

It looked like it had been taken from inside the room.

It felt like years passed.

I don’t mean that metaphorically.

My knee started hurting from shrapnel in one mission. It never healed right. I felt older. Worn down. Like deployment fatigue was baked into my bones.

Replacements came and died.

I got promoted.

I gave orders.

I stopped flinching when people screamed.

Then one day, mid-operation, everything froze.

The jungle glitched.

Sound cut out like someone pulled a cable.

The sky turned to static.

And I fell.

I woke up on my couch.

My apartment ceiling above me.

Headset still on.

The clock said I’d been in for three hours.

Three hours.

I stumbled to the bathroom mirror and just stared.

Physically, I looked the same.

But my eyes were wrong.

There was this distance in them. Like I’d seen something I wasn’t supposed to survive.

I thought the worst part was over.

I was wrong.

The first night, I woke up on the floor holding a pillow like a rifle.

A car backfired outside the next day and I dropped behind my desk before I could stop myself.

The smell of burning fuel lingers sometimes. For no reason.

I checked the forums.

Other people felt it too.

One guy wrote: “Anyone else feel like it lasted longer than it should have?”

I messaged him.

We both played for three hours.

We both said it felt like years.

He stopped responding after that.

I haven’t put the headset back on.

It’s in my closet.

Sometimes I swear I hear radio static at night.

Faint.

Like someone trying to reach me.

Once, I woke up to the sound of boots walking across my hardwood floor.

Slow. Measured.

I didn’t move.

I just lay there, waiting for someone to whisper, “Clear.”

The worst part happened four days ago.

The power went out in my building.

Everything went dark at once.

And I heard artillery.

The walls shook. Plaster dust fell from the ceiling.

I grabbed a lamp without thinking and positioned myself by the door.

When I opened it, the hallway wasn’t my hallway.

It was concrete. Scarred with bullet holes. Smoke drifting through it.

A soldier ran past me.

“Move, Dale!”

For a second, I believed it.

Fully.

I stepped into the corridor.

And then it flickered.

Carpet. Beige walls. Emergency lights.

Then concrete again.

Then normal.

It stabilized.

My neighbor stood there asking if I was okay.

I was holding the lamp like a weapon.

There’s sand in my apartment.

I keep cleaning it.

It keeps coming back.

Not piles.

Just a thin layer along the baseboards. On the windowsill.

Yesterday I found it on my bedsheets.

Warm.

I don’t know how that’s possible.

I’m writing this because I don’t trust my memory anymore.

I don’t know if I logged out.

I don’t know if this is the “after.”

Sometimes, when I close my eyes, I hear a voice:

“Final objective incomplete.”

And I wake up with my heart racing, convinced that at any second, the sky above me is going to tear open and the desert will bleed through.

If that happens, if any of you buy this game, and you see my name in your squad roster…

Please.

So I'm gonna be real, about 3-4 months ago I was pretty much checked out of my rs. Not because she did anything wrong, I just stopped feeling it. Four years in and everything she did either annoyed me or just didn't register anymore. I was mentally halfway out the door.

Before I pulled the trigger on ending things, I stumbled on this book that talked about small consistent appreciation. Basically the idea is you deliberately notice and acknowledge the good things someone does, no matter how small or funny they seem. Like she made coffee in the morning. She laughed at something I said. She remembered I had a rough day and didn't bug me about chores. Stuff like that.

So I started writing one thing down every single day. Just one positive thing she did. Didn't tell her about it. Didn't make it a big deal. Just me, a notes app, and one line a day.

First couple weeks I felt like I was forcing it. I'd sit there at night trying to think of something and it felt pointless. But I kept doing it anyway cause why not.

Around week 5 or 6 something shifted. I started noticing things in real time instead of having to dig for them at the end of the day. By month 2 I genuinely started looking forward to seeing what she'd do. Not in a weird observational way, just like, I was paying attention to her again for the first time in a long time.

Now at 3 months I can honestly say I'm more into her than I've been in probably two years. And the wild part is she didn't change at all. I did. I just trained my brain to stop taking the good stuff for granted and only holding onto the bad.

I'm not saying this fixes everything or works for everyone. But if you're in a long term rs and you feel like the spark died, maybe the spark is still there and you just stopped appreciating it. I plan on keeping this going for as long as I need to. Might just be a forever thing honestly and I'm fine with that.

**TLDR:** Was ready to end my 4 year relationship, started writing down one positive thing my partner did each day instead. Three months later I'm more into her than I've been in years, she didn't change, I did. Appreciating small things every single day rewires your brain to focus on the positives.",48,1771645757.0,relationships,4,0.86,False

At night, my husband and I usually put a sleep podcast on to help us drift off. Usually they're about 30-45 mins long, but unbeknownst to us tonight's was a special episode that runs for a few hours. This is relevant.

We settle down at about 11pm, podcast on my husband's phone. Lovely. I fall asleep almost instantly, have a nice long dream and wake up (what I now know to be) about an hour and a half-ish to two hours later. For some reason my dumbass half-asleep brain — coming to after what was *surely* a full-night's sleep hearing noises coming from a phone — decides that it's my 6am medication alarm, despite the fact that A) it's not my phone, B) it doesn't sound remotely like any of our morning alarms and C) it's still dark as hell outside.

So whilst I'm flapping at my once soundly-asleep and now very confused husband to turn off the ""alarm"".... down the hatch goes the Elvanse.

Then I hear him mumble something something ""podcast"", recall that my morning alarm is not in fact a man talking about Greek myths, and the penny drops. FFS. 

So here I am, wide awake at 3am on my legalised Speed, after a lot of swearing at myself, some very kind comforting from my husband, two glasses of effervescent Vitamin C, and a merciful but short nap before the meds kicked in.

I feel like my routine will suffer for days! Has anyone else ever done this and what did you do because surely I'm not going to be taking more Elvanse at 6am... I'm thinking coffee and yoga in the morning to try and get through the day without crashing and then an early night??
I tell you I am thanking my lucky stars it's Saturday!

TL;DR: Thought our sleepcast was my morning alarm and ended up accidentally taking my Elvanse in the middle of the night. It's nearly 4am and I am very awake! ",5,1771645638.0,adhdwomen,3,0.86,False
1ragtjt,https://i.redd.it/fygega20srkg1.jpeg,Bhailog horror/comedy ki el story likhi hai mast si. Please padhkar apna reviews do. It’s bit long but TL;DR in comments. End mein ek surprise bhi hai,"Disclaimer: apart from few characters, rest of the characters might feel flat and useless, some plot may not be explained well or transitioned well. It is because the version I have wrote is only a structural pathway on which the main plot of movie is followed. On proper writing, it will be made dense by conversations between side characters to add layers and drama.

Just for reference sake I am naming it Bb4 and all the characters are of that universe only.

So the movie opens with midnight shot of a village. The village is very dimly lit with only lamps and small lights outside. We see a back facing shot of someone walking through that village with huge ghungroo in feet. Its a very creepy vibe. While walking its also humming a hum of AAMI JE TOMAR. That figure looks through an open window inside a house. There sleeps a young girl child. The age would be roughly around 2. We can only see red glowing eyes from that figure and rest is covered in a shawl. The figure throws a candy at the child. The child wakes up by it and looks at window. The figure shows the kid a shiny bag of candies. Kid gets happy and on all 4 crawls towards that figure. As the kid reaches near the figure takes of its shawl (still not visible to audience who it is) and puts it on the kid and runs away. All this while we can hear the creepy vibes of silent night and hum of AAMI JE TOMAR. 

Story jumps 10 months back.

We see Kriti Sanon. Who is getting out of her house to go to her college that is in different city so she will be gone for months. She belongs to the neighbouring village of that figure and her family is very religious and superstitious. As she is about to exit, her father played by Sanjay Mishra says to her that when she will be back next time they will get her married as she will be graduating by then.

Her cousin is dropping her off. They are in a car. He is congratulating her on her potential marriage and is saying that they will find a potential good husband. She says that she has already found a guy for herself. Her cousin says that the father will never agree but she says that she have a plan. 

Cut to:

Kartik and Rajpal spitting out their coffee. They look at kriti in shock and ask have she gone stupid or what upon hearing her suggestion. Kriti suggests that she would act like she is under possession of some spirit. As her parents are very religious and superstitious and are also not well informed reason them being villagers, so they would get scared and shit. Kartik would enter the house as a dhongi baba and ask for Kriti’s hand in favor of getting the spirit out of her. (Kriti in this movie is shown very nibbi types). After bunch of this Kartik finally agrees to her demands and accepts that he will come as a tantrik. Then there is a party song after this that transitions to a live romantic song as this song shows transition from that day to the car trip back to Kriti’s home months later.  She takes Rajpal with her as someone from her college who wants to experience village life. 

Family starts showing her images of potential spouses. Just to fake it she even selects one. Everyone is happy and is celebrating however next day as they open their door, they see someone has done black magic on their house. This was done by Kartik. And now Kriti starts her fake possession acting. Here she started her acting and on the other hand Kartik got a call from his home in Himachal telling him his grandma is very sick and wants to see him. Kartik had to leave Kriti but he tells her that he will be back shortly and she should continue with her acting for few days and have fun. Now we see many comedy sequences of her whole family scared of her and trying different funny superstitious activities that could fix her. Kriti’s family along with Rajpal there and her ott acting would pack in serious fun. Now even a week passes but Kartik tells he is stuck their and might have to call off this plan. But Kriti is very adamant, she says that she will bring her whole family to his place saying there is a baba’s dera that could fix things like this. Everybody agrees on this plan. Now we again get a montage shot of their whole family travelling. The vibe is still fun. It goes from car>train>bus. Kriti is still acting possessed and family is trying to hide the fact prom public. These back and forths can also get many funny moments. Plus this will have typical and nostalgic Indian travel vibes making audience connect more.

Now they reach there. It was Rajpal who told them about this place and baba. One more thing about him, he is a heavy drinker in this film so he is literally a loaded gun that could fire anytime, however this thing also leads him to short term memory. Rajpal leads them to the cave. However due to his antics, he mistakenly brings them to some other cave. In that cave is a old and very very weak old lady. This place looks very spooky. Rajpal thinks this is part of plan maybe and introduces them to her as who will treat Kriti. Kriti is made to lie on a table. The lady very slowly gets up and starts doing her magic and waves her stick in the air. The ground starts to shake vigorously yet she continues performing ritual. Somebody tries to interrupt but the lady stops them and says to not stop them. She says that she has opened the gate in Kriti’s body that stops any spirit from entering or exiting. She says that while the gate is open, she must remain very concentrated and not disturbed as this might lead to Kriti’s own soul exiting the body. Even if slight mistake is made, the gate might remain open for any other soul to enter or hers to exit later. The procedure is done, Kriti looks fine and everybody goes home. Now after this is over Kriti calls Kartik to say that the set and effects were nice but why didn’t he come himself. He says he wasn’t even aware of them coming. He was told these guys would come a week later (Rajpal’s blunder). They are like fuck our plan didn’t work and are questioning what should they do now. Kartik asks about the procedure and its potential side effects but Kriti ignores it. (Nibbi)

Interval 

Kartik comes back to village. He and kriti meet in some farm. They are having discussions about what can they do next. In middle of conversation Kriti suddenly rushes to side as she had to puke. They thought it was due to travel her body was messed up. 

They go through multiple ideas but cant come up with anything( funny sequence ). In the end they decide that she will tell at home herself. She goes home and literally tells her dad. Her family is so overjoyed by her recovery that they agree with whatever she says. They have a pooja at her home for her recovery and well being and ask her to invite him there. Kartik enters and have a good impression on the family and a happy sequence goes on. Night falls, Kartik and Rajpaal are sleeping on cot in varanda. It’s a peaceful night. Suddenly kriti comes running out in a corner in varanda and starts  puking . Like she is puking violently and even makes loud noises. Everyone wakes up and comes to see her. When they check on her she is puking blood. After a while she faints. Her cousin picks her and takes her away. She is put to bed. Everyone thinks it’s aftermath of the possession removal. They call a doctor next day. He gives her medicine and tells the family to take care of her. Her whole family is very worried about her. Her father says that he will head out to other village to find some baba to do treatment on her and fix her. He would be back by 3 days. Now we see sequence of some drama and horror shots. These contain sequence of kriti progressively getting weaker, puking, doing strange things that scare the family, kartik taking care of her. There can also be a sick twist here that Kriti is now doing same things under actual possession now which she did while fake acting. This will also make audience feel sad for her. Now after 3 days her father brings back a pandit (can be sanjay mishra but in serious character). The pandit does some basic puja on her and tells family that it looks like somebody is trying to control her body. He says this will only calm her for few days but its treatment should be done by some big shot guru. He tells them about his senior. (Please God make this a Akshay Kumar cameo). Pandit tells them that somebody will have to go fetch him as he should stay here to keep her calm till then. The cousin and the dad leaves for him. Now kriti is again fine for one week. One week later falls full moon night. Kriti starts shaking violently, she is screaming, she is throwing things and she even tossed the bed and after all that she suddenly turns ok and gives a very relieved expression. Everyone is very confused. Nobody understands what’s going on and kriti asks what’s going on. Now we see multiple shots of everyone acting confused around kriti while she is totally normal. 2 weeks later we see Kartik who is still at Kriti’s home opens the door upon bell hearing. He sees its police. The police informs the family that the father and the cousin have posed away. Their death remains very mysterious. It was like all of a sudden they just stopped breathing. All the family is shattered. Before leaving the officer inquired whether they had any young girls at home. He told them to be cautious as for past one week many young girls have been going missing in neighbouring villages. Now there is a sad song montage. We see grief, we see anger of some family members on Kriti, we see kartik suspicious of Kriti, we see police solving the case of father’s death and in the background of this scene it is heavily implied that police is working very hard on solving missing children’s case. Even the news flash says there have been reports of ghost that villagers have seen roaming at nights. They hear ghunghroo sounds and hear someone singing in Bangla. The whistle of cold winter nights play a melody to her vocals. At the end of song we see Kartik goes to Kriti’s room to check up on her. When he goes in he sees her weeping. He sits on bed and put a hand on her shoulder, as soon as he does it she just falls into his arms. She started crying out loud and saying that they never should have joked about such things. Their one lie has opened the doors for dark energies to enter. Dad died because of this and now even kids are disappearing. Kartik consoles her and tells her that they will find a solution. Then we hear a knock at door. Kriti’s uncle was returning from a teerth. He was yet to be informed about his son’s death. When he enters the house his DIL just rushes to him, hugs him and starts crying. Without any words said he understands everything. He had his grand daughter in his hands. That little baby felt so heavy to him that he just put her down and started walking towards his room. Upon posting Kriti, he gives a very disgusted look and just silently goes in room. Door closes and then we hear anything from him. Just loud sounds of cry as he lost a lot as a father and brother. Tears start falling down upon Kriti’s eyes as this is happening. Seeing this the bahu who was on the floor broken and exhausted by crying since two weeks, with her daughter in her arms angrily looks at her. She says why is she crying. Kriti is the reason all of this is happening. She tells that she overheard kartik and kriti’s convo and she knows the truth. She drops the bomb. Everyone is shocked. The mom has lost all the hope on her daughter due to who this family is bearing so much now. All because of a tiny harmless lie. Everybody just turns their back on the trio. Kriti is also about to go isolate herself in her room and while that she is venting out her anger on herself. While doing so she blurts few lines in Bangla which catches Kartik’s eyes. Now night falls. The granddaughter is hugging her grandpa sleeping. Suddenly shot changes and audience sees Kriti standing behind their bed with a very wide and creepy smile and red eyes. It’s not even like just a grin she has her mouth stretched wide open with a smile on face. She is about to touch the child but light turns on and its Kartik. Kartik asks kriti to get away from the kid. She doesnt say anything but gives a loud shreik scream. Everybody gathers and is shocked by this. As soon as kartik is about to rush towards the kid to save her, kriti picks a knife and throws it a kartik which misses his eye by a second. Now this is a full horror sequence as the whole family tries to save the young girl from Kriti. In the end she succeeds and runs towards the forest with the child. As she is rubbing away she is lounging very loud, as loud as a witch and in the same way. Kartik follows the amalgamation of the sound of the witch laugh and the kid crying. 

Next morning shot

rajpal is doing Kartik’s first aid as he is injured from last night. The grandfather asks how did he knew that this would happen to kids. He even looks away in disgust and asks with deep sorrow if this was also any of ill plans to trouble his family just to get their wishes fulfilled. He tells that it’s not like it, he points out her speaking Bangla the other day. He even says that the other day he say wet mud on kriti’s slippers while it hadn’t rained for long time in their village but it did in neighbouring villages. This thing only raised his suspicions enough but he didn’t pay much attention. He also found some beads in her room the other day but he couldn’t make it out what it was and thought was since part of her clothing. Upon hearing her Bangla he rushed to those beads and identified them to be ghungroos. The mom just shatters and says that it is for sure some evil eye because their daughter was about to get married. Kartik says it might be because of the other lady baba they visited. She was pulling a spirit from her body but there was no evil spirit in her and this might have left her body more vulnerable to these evil attacks. Kartik says this time he and Rajpal will go to find the guru that Pandit was telling about. Its midnight and they are both packing their stuff. All of a sudden we start hearing ghungroos shaking. They are shaking with a perfect rhythm like someone is dancing on them. After few seconds a song follows. AAMI JE TOMAR. Everybody watches her dance. This is a dramatic scene. Towards the end of her dance she is spinning. We see this scene from top. The framing is perfectly symmetrical and face in straight and looks like her nose is the anchor. Her speed keeps on increasing, song playing in background and her laughing while looking up like a witch. Kartik’s face is full of tears and he leaves the home in anger and leaves for the guru right away. Rajpal runs after him and goes with him. 

We see montage shot of Kartik going on a tough and life demanding journey to find the guru. While this is happening kriti is tied with a tree in varanda. She is visibly very weak with continuous to laugh. Even if its weak laughs she is still laughing till the point she becomes unconscious out of exhaustion. Rajpal fails in not even 10% toughness of this journey and he leaves kartik to go alone. We see kartik’s love and dedication for kriti. His determination to make this hard journey to save his love. One month have passed. Kartik looks messed up and completely like a homeless. We see him entering a cave with very weak steps. Now we step into final act. We see that kriti have escaped her tree. The whole family is scared and looking for her. Kartik enters. He tells them not to worry anymore. He pulls out a glass vile tied to a thread that he has worn on his neck. By showing that vile he shouts and calls Kriti to wherever she is come here. To everyone’s shock kriti actually comes. Again full drama scene. Kartik asks her to go inside and sleep. She goes in locks the room and falls asleep. After this everyone asks how he did that.

Now he reveals everything.

He tells when he met that guru, he told him that the lady they visited earlier wasn’t some tantrik, she was a bengali witch. And an evil one. Her name was Manjulika. She actually abducts children and traps them in a deep sleep like state so she could suck their youth out of them. Manjulika was first discovered by a King Sidhartha. When he found out about what she does to kids he got best godmen of that time and weakened her and locked her in a cave. She is trapped in the cave and cant exit and that cave was also very deep in moutains. Its a surprise they even found it. He says when they entered the cave and she performed the ritual on her, she actually put Kriti under her mind control. All the things kriti was doing was because of being under her control. The reason why she was puking or acting strange from returning there was the mind control wasn’t perfect at time and her body was opposing it. On full moon night the powers grew too strong to oppose and kriti lost. Later under her mind control she started abducting the kids for her because she herself cant get out of the cave. 6 days from now her plan will come in fruition and its important that the witch is killed on that day only. If not and killed on any other day then their is risk of her finding an escape through either the kids or kriti. When they form a link then from all three areas the witch would need to be burned. The guru picked a whiff of Kriti from kartik and locates the witch. Kartik tells that the guru will kill the actual witch, kartik will take care of kriti and someone from family would have to go take care of the kids. With that vile kartik finds location of the kids. 

Now tension builds up for conclusion. One day before the ritual kartik goes to Grandpa’s room. He opens up to her that the procedure he has to do with kriti can end up in many ways.

\- \[ \] Empty her brain, brainwashing her

\- \[ \] Killing kriti

\- \[ \] Kriti being under wich’s control forever

\- \[ \] Kartik dying (most chances are of this)

Grandpa just breaks down and kartik just leaves. 

Now the three scenarios. The family is in the forest. They have made runes around the house and have gotten the kids out. The kids are in coma like situation but their eyes are still open. We see they draw a very specific rune on all of the kids forehead. Now they start chanting a mantra in front of the house 

On the other side Akshay enters the cave and just stakes the witch through her heart. Over there at home kartik is chanting a mantra while kriti is dancing to AAMI JE TOMAR around him. We can see her dance is with anger and she is thumping her feet so hard that its bleeding. When we see the shot from top we see kartik in the middle, kriti doing circles around him and we see a circle made with blood around him. Now the clock ticks 3:33

The witch wakes up and is chanting a mantra. All the kids and kriti start chanting that mantra too. It forms a perfect symphony. As the kids are singing they are rapidly again and the witch is getting younger. We are a slight magical power fight between manjulika. While there is a physical fight going on between kriti kartik. The kids also act like zombies and attack the family member. Despite all of these attacks the family have to stay strong and fight back and finish procedure. The intensity of fight is, the kids vs family is totally one sided. The kids have completely held the family in a lock and not even allowing them to move. The couple is that kriti is attacking kartik and he is just defending himself. Akshay and manjulika is a full on fight. Now clock ticks 4. With enough struggle one family member is able to get free and throws a doll with same rune on its forehead as the kids towards the house and throws a special packet after it. Same thing kartik does as he sneakily pastes the rune over her head and throws same doll towards the tree she used to be tied to followed by the same packet. Over here Akshay also puts rune on her and throws a stake towards the witch and a packet too. At the same time they all hit the target and a huge blast follows. The house catches fire, the tree catches fire and so does the witch along with the dolls. The connection of runes connect all of the places for the witch to sneak in and hide. Akshay starts chanting final mantras and all the runes start glowing and the victims and witch start vibrating. This is going on then kartik rushed towards rajpal and hands him the vile and asks his to empty this vile in ganges tomorrow morning and say some final words. Rajpal asks where he is going. Kartik tells the guru told him that to kill a as strong witch as manjulika the would need a sacrifice by fire at same time. And this would be needed to do this time only as if they attack once and it doesn’t end for good, it will be very bad for the victims. He also says  that no more than one sacrifice will be accepted. Rajpal is very shocked and confused and clueless about the situation. He sees as Kartik walks towards the burning tree with heavy steps. Kriti lying there on side shaking violently with her feet bleeding and strong winds flowing. Kartik goes and stands there in fire and gives a final look at kriti. Kriti is also witnessing her love’s sacrifice for her. A sad and melancholic version of love song of movie plays. Both of them have tears in their eyes and extend their hands towards each other. In a split second fire engulfs him and there is a huge fire blast. Screen turns white. We see the kids have turned normal, Kriti have turned fine and the witch is dead. Kriti looks towards Kartik and sees that he is alive just unconscious. She wakes him up and he is shocked that how is he alive. We are shown the grandpa made the initial sacrifice helping in elimination of the witch. 

We see montage shots of kartik helping kriti recover, the kids returning home, everything healing. Then we see shot of the grandpa’s tervi. Kartik is leaving on that day as he has been here for very long now. Kriti wants to go with him as she is mentally very weak. The family also agrees and says that when you come next time we will send her with you permanently by marrying you. Kriti is standing at the side with Rajpal she is having some talk. On the other side her mother asks kartik whether he will be able to handle her with her weak mental state. He drops his cheeky smile and says don’t sorry I have found a very good psychiatrist for her. Car pulls up, full loud music, window rolld down and it’s og akshay Kumar from og bhool bhulaiya 1. He comes and asks them to sit quickly. Bhool bhulaiya 1 bells starts playing. Movie ends by a shot of akshay driving car with rajpal on passenger seat and couple at back. Akshay says to Kartik that don’t get involved in this ghosts business so much, take the girl on honeymoon and leave these things for him. Kartik ignores. Akshay looks to his side Rajpal is high and sitting with his head out of car window. Akshay releases car’s windshield fluid. And the classic Akshay Rajpal joke of “paani paani” repeats. Couple laughs. Car drives away. Movie ends.",2,1771645614.0,pj_explained,3,1.0,False

Doesn’t matter if you’re using cash, card, or bank transfer. The transaction will not complete until you say the amount out loud clearly enough for anyone nearby to hear.

This includes everything. Buying coffee? You have to say “€3.50” out loud before tapping your card. Paying rent? You have to announce “€1,200” before the transfer processes. Online shopping? You have to say the amount out loud in your home before clicking purchase. Doesn’t matter if you’re alone or in a crowded shop, the rule applies everywhere forever.

This would also apply to any discounts or promotions. So if you’re using something like a loyalty card that gives €10 off every €100 spent, you have to announce both the original price and the discounted price out loud. “€247, minus €20, final total €227” or the payment won’t work.

And yes, even for business transactions too. So let's say you’re messaging a supplier on alibaba negotiating bulk orders for €3,000, you’d have to say “€3,000” out loud before confirming payment even though you’re just sitting alone at your computer.

Would you take the €5 million or is the embarrassment and inconvenience not worth it?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",7,1771645507.0,hypotheticalsituation,13,0.89,False

My desk itself is still a work in progress, but I've included a few inspiration pics to show the vibe/mood I’m trying to achieve.

The space next to my desk is just under 120 cm (\~4 ft). I was thinking of adding a small sideboard/cabinet for a coffee bar, but got overwhelmed by options. I’d also love ideas for hiding my cat’s litter, since there’s no other spots in my place currently (it's just out next to the TV right now).

I’d love any advice or inspiration for furniture/decor for this area, or just general tips for making a small space feel more put together. I'm open to pretty much any ideas or guidance :) Thanks so much!",5,1771645437.0,HomeDecorating,3,0.86,False

Look, I know that this sounds really cliché, but I need your help with what to do.



But I know people want to know what happened, so let me tell you.



It started like any other day; I woke up at 7 am for my office job, I had a shower, I got dressed, and I headed to the kitchen to have my morning coffee.



As I was drinking my coffee, I decided to enjoy the scenery (something I don't normally get to do in my hectic life). I looked out of my clear glass window. It was a nice, clear morning; there were no clouds in sight. In fact, I was actually zoning out while looking out onto the clear, desolate street; there was not a single car, motorbike, or even skateboarder in sight. 



But that's when something weird and peculiar caught my eye. 



something so strange that I nearly dropped my mug and spilt my coffee and spat out my last bite of toast.



It was my neighbor, and not just any neighbor, but my neighbor who lives across the street, my neighbor who's in his late 90s, Mr. Jenkins. He's the type of neighbour who is just there when you need him to be. 



Mr Jenkins was putting stuff in a freshly dug hole in his front yard.

And I saw what kinds of things it was.

It was cameras and camcorders and drives and monitors and stuff I didn't even know he owned.



The weird thing is, though, Mr Jenkins is in his 90s, so how the fuck is he doing this?



""What the fuck is he burying at this time of day, and better yet, how?"" I said to myself.



I watched as he continued to fill this hole with his heavy shovel, which I didn't even know he owned.

This is the same 90-something man whose trash can I had to bring in because he couldn't lift it because of his back.

The same man who basically has arthritis in every joint

The same man who relies on a cane to even move around.

the same man who you'll most likely see in a wheelchair 

The same man who's on inhalers and hundreds upon hundreds of medicines a day

He then looked up and saw me looking at him, and he ran into his house. And I mean, fucking ran at speeds even I can't reach, and I'm in my 30s.



""HOW THE FUCK IS HE RUNNING?"" I thought.



Mind you, he was at the front of his 6-foot yard, and he ran from the front of the yard and into his house while he was running. I swear I saw him running on all fours. Then again, I could just be sleep-deprived. 



And this is where you come in. What do you guys think I should do?



I'm currently on a lunch break at work as of posting this, so I'll just wait until something else. Until then, Romeo is signing off.",1,1771645427.0,creepypasta,2,1.0,False

Some backstory

 I have been trying to lose some weight for a while now, but I was unsuccessful… I have been struggling with a list of symptoms for over a year now, that really looked like I’ve had some issues with my hormones. I went to my Doctor and Gynecologist, had all my bloodwork done etc. Turns out I have Endometrioses, all my bloodwork results were excellent though. so my doctor prescribed me Wegovy. 

  
I was really excited to start, but also really nervous. I’ve always had anxiety about taking medications, I would rather not take anything but I became so desperate and unhappy that I decided to get over my anxiety. I prepared myself the morning of my first dose (0.25), I drank a bottle of water with electrolytes and got some food with mostly protein. After a nervous breakdown about the needle (lol), I felt pretty good! the food noise went away after a few hours! I felt so happy and really calm. I went to the gym and felt great about that. I did feel a little bit of nausea, but it wasn’t terrible at all and it wasn’t bothering me. I even went out for dinner that night and I was able to eat normall, just less than usual. Now this morning, I woke up feeling super tired! my body felt ‘heavy’ and sleepy. I got some protein, water with electrolytes and a coffee. I am a flight attendant, so I needed to work an international red eye flight later in the evening. I had another nap of 1,5hr, but then I woke up feeling extremely anxious. I noticed I was breathing really tense (hyperventilating), I tried to get ready and find some distraction, but I just couldn’t get out of the heavy and tired feeling. I think the best way to describe this feeling is that it feels like you’re gonna get sick any moment. Is this a normal side effect?! Or was I just super stressed and the hyperventilating just made me tired and worn out? Someone was able to take over my work trip, because I decided to stay home and take it easy. I might be freaking out about it too much. I am not experiencing any headache, heavy nausea or stomach pains besides this…

1ragpck,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ragpck,IKEA meal item reviewed separately,"For your reading pleasure, each item that I had, reviews separately (it's a weekend).

We went on Friday around 2 p.m., there was virtually no wait and the dining area looked quite empty.

After about 1,5 hours of wandering through one level, we were ready for a snack, looking forward to famous meatballs(plant based, for us). each item reviewed separately, 5\* being the best and 1\*-the worst.

5\*-Vegetable medallion. Both of us agreed that it was the best item of our meal. It consisted of potato, onion and some green, which must have given it the flavour. Looking back, I should have just ordered 5 of them and nothing else. Can be bought frozen from their shop, but quite pricey at $14/600gr

4\*-teas and coffees-the machine lets you choose between the options. I am not sure whether they are free refills, but the cups were quite small, so I dared to have some extra (we did buy quite a few things)

4\*-potato chips. Quite flavoursome.

4\*-the peas. We found them a bit dry, possibly from sitting under a hot lamp, but they tasted fresh, not out of the can, They are sustainably  sourced, according to the posted on the wall. Good on IKEA.

4\*- Apple crumble. Full of apples, a bit dry, but pleasant and with a delicate cinnamon overtone.

4\*-Apple cider (non alcoholic, in a can)-it was cool and refreshing, but not much flavour.

3\*-mashed potato. The chips and the medallion had much more flavour. This was just bland, but I have a problem with mashed potato in the West.

3\*-plant based meatballs and gravy. I was surprised how small the meatballs were and while they weren't bad, size matters. Gravy helped, as they would taste too dry otherwise, but just like the mashed potato,  the gravy lacked personality.

3\*-Banoffee pie. We ordered it, because it looked delicious, but it didn't taste of either toffee caramel or banana, very bland. EDITED-thanks for pointing out, not coffee, toffee instead.

2\*-Cinnamon roll-the biggest disappointment for us. Stodgy and chewy, although warm. Maybe that's how Sweedes do them, but we felt it was not for us.

We paid around $60 for all (the receipt doesn't include the banoffe pie, hot drinks and one more medallion which were purchased later). It was a simple meal that sustained us before we went exploring the other floor, but we wouldn't buy it again ( except maybe frozen medallions).",16,1771645253.0,aucklandeats,24,0.78,False

The story follows thematic transition from comedy to horror to fantasy horror,"Just for reference sake I am naming it Bb4 and all the characters are of that universe only.

So the movie opens with midnight shot of a village. The village is very dimly lit with only lamps and small lights outside. We see a back facing shot of someone walking through that village with huge ghungroo in feet. Its a very creepy vibe. While walking its also humming a hum of AAMI JE TOMAR. That figure looks through an open window inside a house. There sleeps a young girl child. The age would be roughly around 2. We can only see red glowing eyes from that figure and rest is covered in a shawl. The figure throws a candy at the child. The child wakes up by it and looks at window. The figure shows the kid a shiny bag of candies. Kid gets happy and on all 4 crawls towards that figure. As the kid reaches near the figure takes of its shawl (still not visible to audience who it is) and puts it on the kid and runs away. All this while we can hear the creepy vibes of silent night and hum of AAMI JE TOMAR. 

Story jumps 10 months back.

We see Kriti Sanon. Who is getting out of her house to go to her college that is in different city so she will be gone for months. She belongs to the neighbouring village of that figure and her family is very religious and superstitious. As she is about to exit, her father played by Sanjay Mishra says to her that when she will be back next time they will get her married as she will be graduating by then.

Her cousin is dropping her off. They are in a car. He is congratulating her on her potential marriage and is saying that they will find a potential good husband. She says that she has already found a guy for herself. Her cousin says that the father will never agree but she says that she have a plan.

Kartik and Rajpal spitting out their coffee. They look at kriti in shock and ask have she gone stupid or what upon hearing her suggestion. Kriti suggests that she would act like she is under possession of some spirit. As her parents are very religious and superstitious and are also not well informed reason them being villagers, so they would get scared and shit. Kartik would enter the house as a dhongi baba and ask for Kriti’s hand in favor of getting the spirit out of her. (Kriti in this movie is shown very nibbi types). After bunch of this Kartik finally agrees to her demands and accepts that he will come as a tantrik. Then there is a party song after this that transitions to a live romantic song as this song shows transition from that day to the car trip back to Kriti’s home months later.  She takes Rajpal with her as someone from her college who wants to experience village life. 

Family starts showing her images of potential spouses. Just to fake it she even selects one. Everyone is happy and is celebrating however next day as they open their door, they see someone has done black magic on their house. This was done by Kartik. And now Kriti starts her fake possession acting. Here she started her acting and on the other hand Kartik got a call from his home in Himachal telling him his grandma is very sick and wants to see him. Kartik had to leave Kriti but he tells her that he will be back shortly and she should continue with her acting for few days and have fun. Now we see many comedy sequences of her whole family scared of her and trying different funny superstitious activities that could fix her. Kriti’s family along with Rajpal there and her ott acting would pack in serious fun. Now even a week passes but Kartik tells he is stuck their and might have to call off this plan. But Kriti is very adamant, she says that she will bring her whole family to his place saying there is a baba’s dera that could fix things like this. Everybody agrees on this plan. Now we again get a montage shot of their whole family travelling. The vibe is still fun. It goes from car>train>bus. Kriti is still acting possessed and family is trying to hide the fact prom public. These back and forths can also get many funny moments. Plus this will have typical and nostalgic Indian travel vibes making audience connect more.

Now they reach there. It was Rajpal who told them about this place and baba. One more thing about him, he is a heavy drinker in this film so he is literally a loaded gun that could fire anytime, however this thing also leads him to short term memory. Rajpal leads them to the cave. However due to his antics, he mistakenly brings them to some other cave. In that cave is a old and very very weak old lady. This place looks very spooky. Rajpal thinks this is part of plan maybe and introduces them to her as who will treat Kriti. Kriti is made to lie on a table. The lady very slowly gets up and starts doing her magic and waves her stick in the air. The ground starts to shake vigorously yet she continues performing ritual. Somebody tries to interrupt but the lady stops them and says to not stop them. She says that she has opened the gate in Kriti’s body that stops any spirit from entering or exiting. She says that while the gate is open, she must remain very concentrated and not disturbed as this might lead to Kriti’s own soul exiting the body. Even if slight mistake is made, the gate might remain open for any other soul to enter or hers to exit later. The procedure is done, Kriti looks fine and everybody goes home. Now after this is over Kriti calls Kartik to say that the set and effects were nice but why didn’t he come himself. He says he wasn’t even aware of them coming. He was told these guys would come a week later (Rajpal’s blunder). They are like fuck our plan didn’t work and are questioning what should they do now. Kartik asks about the procedure and its potential side effects but Kriti ignores it. (Nibbi)

Interval 

Kartik comes back to village. He and kriti meet in some farm. They are having discussions about what can they do next. In middle of conversation Kriti suddenly rushes to side as she had to puke. They thought it was due to travel her body was messed up. 

They go through multiple ideas but cant come up with anything( funny sequence ). In the end they decide that she will tell at home herself. She goes home and literally tells her dad. Her family is so overjoyed by her recovery that they agree with whatever she says. They have a pooja at her home for her recovery and well being and ask her to invite him there. Kartik enters and have a good impression on the family and a happy sequence goes on. Night falls, Kartik and Rajpaal are sleeping on cot in varanda. It’s a peaceful night. Suddenly kriti comes running out in a corner in varanda and starts  puking . Like she is puking violently and even makes loud noises. Everyone wakes up and comes to see her. When they check on her she is puking blood. After a while she faints. Her cousin picks her and takes her away. She is put to bed. Everyone thinks it’s aftermath of the possession removal. They call a doctor next day. He gives her medicine and tells the family to take care of her. Her whole family is very worried about her. Her father says that he will head out to other village to find some baba to do treatment on her and fix her. He would be back by 3 days. Now we see sequence of some drama and horror shots. These contain sequence of kriti progressively getting weaker, puking, doing strange things that scare the family, kartik taking care of her. There can also be a sick twist here that Kriti is now doing same things under actual possession now which she did while fake acting. This will also make audience feel sad for her. Now after 3 days her father brings back a pandit (can be sanjay mishra but in serious character). The pandit does some basic puja on her and tells family that it looks like somebody is trying to control her body. He says this will only calm her for few days but its treatment should be done by some big shot guru. He tells them about his senior. (Please God make this a Akshay Kumar cameo). Pandit tells them that somebody will have to go fetch him as he should stay here to keep her calm till then. The cousin and the dad leaves for him. Now kriti is again fine for one week. One week later falls full moon night. Kriti starts shaking violently, she is screaming, she is throwing things and she even tossed the bed and after all that she suddenly turns ok and gives a very relieved expression. Everyone is very confused. Nobody understands what’s going on and kriti asks what’s going on. Now we see multiple shots of everyone acting confused around kriti while she is totally normal. 2 weeks later we see Kartik who is still at Kriti’s home opens the door upon bell hearing. He sees its police. The police informs the family that the father and the cousin have posed away. Their death remains very mysterious. It was like all of a sudden they just stopped breathing. All the family is shattered. Before leaving the officer inquired whether they had any young girls at home. He told them to be cautious as for past one week many young girls have been going missing in neighbouring villages. Now there is a sad song montage. We see grief, we see anger of some family members on Kriti, we see kartik suspicious of Kriti, we see police solving the case of father’s death and in the background of this scene it is heavily implied that police is working very hard on solving missing children’s case. Even the news flash says there have been reports of ghost that villagers have seen roaming at nights. They hear ghunghroo sounds and hear someone singing in Bangla. The whistle of cold winter nights play a melody to her vocals. At the end of song we see Kartik goes to Kriti’s room to check up on her. When he goes in he sees her weeping. He sits on bed and put a hand on her shoulder, as soon as he does it she just falls into his arms. She started crying out loud and saying that they never should have joked about such things. Their one lie has opened the doors for dark energies to enter. Dad died because of this and now even kids are disappearing. Kartik consoles her and tells her that they will find a solution. Then we hear a knock at door. Kriti’s uncle was returning from a teerth. He was yet to be informed about his son’s death. When he enters the house his DIL just rushes to him, hugs him and starts crying. Without any words said he understands everything. He had his grand daughter in his hands. That little baby felt so heavy to him that he just put her down and started walking towards his room. Upon posting Kriti, he gives a very disgusted look and just silently goes in room. Door closes and then we hear anything from him. Just loud sounds of cry as he lost a lot as a father and brother. Tears start falling down upon Kriti’s eyes as this is happening. Seeing this the bahu who was on the floor broken and exhausted by crying since two weeks, with her daughter in her arms angrily looks at her. She says why is she crying. Kriti is the reason all of this is happening. She tells that she overheard kartik and kriti’s convo and she knows the truth. She drops the bomb. Everyone is shocked. The mom has lost all the hope on her daughter due to who this family is bearing so much now. All because of a tiny harmless lie. Everybody just turns their back on the trio. Kriti is also about to go isolate herself in her room and while that she is venting out her anger on herself. While doing so she blurts few lines in Bangla which catches Kartik’s eyes. Now night falls. The granddaughter is hugging her grandpa sleeping. Suddenly shot changes and audience sees Kriti standing behind their bed with a very wide and creepy smile and red eyes. It’s not even like just a grin she has her mouth stretched wide open with a smile on face. She is about to touch the child but light turns on and its Kartik. Kartik asks kriti to get away from the kid. She doesnt say anything but gives a loud shreik scream. Everybody gathers and is shocked by this. As soon as kartik is about to rush towards the kid to save her, kriti picks a knife and throws it a kartik which misses his eye by a second. Now this is a full horror sequence as the whole family tries to save the young girl from Kriti. In the end she succeeds and runs towards the forest with the child. As she is rubbing away she is lounging very loud, as loud as a witch and in the same way. Kartik follows the amalgamation of the sound of the witch laugh and the kid crying. 

Next morning shot

rajpal is doing Kartik’s first aid as he is injured from last night. The grandfather asks how did he knew that this would happen to kids. He even looks away in disgust and asks with deep sorrow if this was also any of ill plans to trouble his family just to get their wishes fulfilled. He tells that it’s not like it, he points out her speaking Bangla the other day. He even says that the other day he say wet mud on kriti’s slippers while it hadn’t rained for long time in their village but it did in neighbouring villages. This thing only raised his suspicions enough but he didn’t pay much attention. He also found some beads in her room the other day but he couldn’t make it out what it was and thought was since part of her clothing. Upon hearing her Bangla he rushed to those beads and identified them to be ghungroos. The mom just shatters and says that it is for sure some evil eye because their daughter was about to get married. Kartik says it might be because of the other lady baba they visited. She was pulling a spirit from her body but there was no evil spirit in her and this might have left her body more vulnerable to these evil attacks. Kartik says this time he and Rajpal will go to find the guru that Pandit was telling about. Its midnight and they are both packing their stuff. All of a sudden we start hearing ghungroos shaking. They are shaking with a perfect rhythm like someone is dancing on them. After few seconds a song follows. AAMI JE TOMAR. Everybody watches her dance. This is a dramatic scene. Towards the end of her dance she is spinning. We see this scene from top. The framing is perfectly symmetrical and face in straight and looks like her nose is the anchor. Her speed keeps on increasing, song playing in background and her laughing while looking up like a witch. Kartik’s face is full of tears and he leaves the home in anger and leaves for the guru right away. Rajpal runs after him and goes with him. 

We see montage shot of Kartik going on a tough and life demanding journey to find the guru. While this is happening kriti is tied with a tree in varanda. She is visibly very weak with continuous to laugh. Even if its weak laughs she is still laughing till the point she becomes unconscious out of exhaustion. Rajpal fails in not even 10% toughness of this journey and he leaves kartik to go alone. We see kartik’s love and dedication for kriti. His determination to make this hard journey to save his love. One month have passed. Kartik looks messed up and completely like a homeless. We see him entering a cave with very weak steps. Now we step into final act. We see that kriti have escaped her tree. The whole family is scared and looking for her. Kartik enters. He tells them not to worry anymore. He pulls out a glass vile tied to a thread that he has worn on his neck. By showing that vile he shouts and calls Kriti to wherever she is come here. To everyone’s shock kriti actually comes. Again full drama scene. Kartik asks her to go inside and sleep. She goes in locks the room and falls asleep. After this everyone asks how he did that.

Now he reveals everything.

He tells when he met that guru, he told him that the lady they visited earlier wasn’t some tantrik, she was a bengali witch. And an evil one. Her name was Manjulika. She actually abducts children and traps them in a deep sleep like state so she could suck their youth out of them. Manjulika was first discovered by a King Sidhartha. When he found out about what she does to kids he got best godmen of that time and weakened her and locked her in a cave. She is trapped in the cave and cant exit and that cave was also very deep in moutains. Its a surprise they even found it. He says when they entered the cave and she performed the ritual on her, she actually put Kriti under her mind control. All the things kriti was doing was because of being under her control. The reason why she was puking or acting strange from returning there was the mind control wasn’t perfect at time and her body was opposing it. On full moon night the powers grew too strong to oppose and kriti lost. Later under her mind control she started abducting the kids for her because she herself cant get out of the cave. 6 days from now her plan will come in fruition and its important that the witch is killed on that day only. If not and killed on any other day then their is risk of her finding an escape through either the kids or kriti. When they form a link then from all three areas the witch would need to be burned. The guru picked a whiff of Kriti from kartik and locates the witch. Kartik tells that the guru will kill the actual witch, kartik will take care of kriti and someone from family would have to go take care of the kids. With that vile kartik finds location of the kids. 

Now tension builds up for conclusion. One day before the ritual kartik goes to Grandpa’s room. He opens up to her that the procedure he has to do with kriti can end up in many ways.

\- \[ \] Empty her brain, brainwashing her

\- \[ \] Killing kriti

\- \[ \] Kriti being under wich’s control forever

\- \[ \] Kartik dying (most chances are of this)

Grandpa just breaks down and kartik just leaves. 

Now the three scenarios. The family is in the forest. They have made runes around the house and have gotten the kids out. The kids are in coma like situation but their eyes are still open. We see they draw a very specific rune on all of the kids forehead. Now they start chanting a mantra in front of the house 

On the other side Akshay enters the cave and just stakes the witch through her heart. Over there at home kartik is chanting a mantra while kriti is dancing to AAMI JE TOMAR around him. We can see her dance is with anger and she is thumping her feet so hard that its bleeding. When we see the shot from top we see kartik in the middle, kriti doing circles around him and we see a circle made with blood around him. Now the clock ticks 3:33

The witch wakes up and is chanting a mantra. All the kids and kriti start chanting that mantra too. It forms a perfect symphony. As the kids are singing they are rapidly again and the witch is getting younger. We are a slight magical power fight between manjulika. While there is a physical fight going on between kriti kartik. The kids also act like zombies and attack the family member. Despite all of these attacks the family have to stay strong and fight back and finish procedure. The intensity of fight is, the kids vs family is totally one sided. The kids have completely held the family in a lock and not even allowing them to move. The couple is that kriti is attacking kartik and he is just defending himself. Akshay and manjulika is a full on fight. Now clock ticks 4. With enough struggle one family member is able to get free and throws a doll with same rune on its forehead as the kids towards the house and throws a special packet after it. Same thing kartik does as he sneakily pastes the rune over her head and throws same doll towards the tree she used to be tied to followed by the same packet. Over here Akshay also puts rune on her and throws a stake towards the witch and a packet too. At the same time they all hit the target and a huge blast follows. The house catches fire, the tree catches fire and so does the witch along with the dolls. The connection of runes connect all of the places for the witch to sneak in and hide. Akshay starts chanting final mantras and all the runes start glowing and the victims and witch start vibrating. This is going on then kartik rushed towards rajpal and hands him the vile and asks his to empty this vile in ganges tomorrow morning and say some final words. Rajpal asks where he is going. Kartik tells the guru told him that to kill a as strong witch as manjulika the would need a sacrifice by fire at same time. And this would be needed to do this time only as if they attack once and it doesn’t end for good, it will be very bad for the victims. He also says  that no more than one sacrifice will be accepted. Rajpal is very shocked and confused and clueless about the situation. He sees as Kartik walks towards the burning tree with heavy steps. Kriti lying there on side shaking violently with her feet bleeding and strong winds flowing. Kartik goes and stands there in fire and gives a final look at kriti. Kriti is also witnessing her love’s sacrifice for her. A sad and melancholic version of love song of movie plays. Both of them have tears in their eyes and extend their hands towards each other. In a split second fire engulfs him and there is a huge fire blast. Screen turns white. We see the kids have turned normal, Kriti have turned fine and the witch is dead. Kriti looks towards Kartik and sees that he is alive just unconscious. She wakes him up and he is shocked that how is he alive. We are shown the grandpa made the initial sacrifice helping in elimination of the witch. 

We see montage shots of kartik helping kriti recover, the kids returning home, everything healing. Then we see shot of the grandpa’s tervi. Kartik is leaving on that day as he has been here for very long now. Kriti wants to go with him as she is mentally very weak. The family also agrees and says that when you come next time we will send her with you permanently by marrying you. Kriti is standing at the side with Rajpal she is having some talk. On the other side her mother asks kartik whether he will be able to handle her with her weak mental state. He drops his cheeky smile and says don’t sorry I have found a very good psychiatrist for her. Car pulls up, full loud music, window rolld down and it’s og akshay Kumar from og bhool bhulaiya 1. He comes and asks them to sit quickly. Bhool bhulaiya 1 bells starts playing. Movie ends by a shot of akshay driving car with rajpal on passenger seat and couple at back. Akshay says to Kartik that don’t get involved in this ghosts business so much, take the girl on honeymoon and leave these things for him. Kartik ignores. Akshay looks to his side Rajpal is high and sitting with his head out of car window. Akshay releases car’s windshield fluid. And the classic Akshay Rajpal joke of “paani paani” repeats. Couple laughs. Car drives away. Movie ends.",1,1771645188.0,bollydiscuss,0,1.0,False

It’s first come, first served, so I signed up because I want to be a businessperson. The instructions were to sit by the coffee shop, and then someone would come find you and bring you down to the photo booth so you could take your pictures.

While I was waiting, this guy came up to me. He was about 5'4"" and had a red mark between his eyes. He introduced himself and shook my hand. I instinctively wiped my hand on my pants afterward. He started talking about whether he could count on my vote for student council or council president or something like that. I just kept nodding and saying I would vote for him while he continued talking.

Then a very cute South American looking girl came up, said hello, and asked if I was who I said I was. I told her yes, and she said, “Okay, come downstairs for your pictures.” As we were about to leave, the guy turned to her and started the same pitch all over again.

You could see on her face that she was uncomfortable. She tried to tell him she was very busy, but he just kept talking. Eventually she basically said, “Just give me your card and I’ll vote.” He responded by asking her to put her student ID into his phone so he could send her the information about voting for him.

1rage25,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1rage25,A very brief and lazy history of drip coffee.,"The history of drip coffee is an interesting one. Far more interesting than I had first assumed.

It goes back all the way to the 1800s.  One of the earliest methods of brewing coffee was simply boiling, also known as cowboy coffee. Grind coffee, add to boiling water, strain coffee into a mug. As you can probably guess, this didn't really make tasty coffee. Recipes often included methods of making coffee drinkable by adding eggshells or salt to the boiling mixture. One of the earliest attempts at improving coffee brewing was the percolator in 1819. I'm not going to get into how that eventually led to siphon brewers and moka brewers. Drip coffee methods existed but were finicky; you had the french drip pot, the Karlsbad-style coffee maker but most consumers desiring convenience stuck with percolators which were patented around 1820.

I'm simplifying of course, there were numerous designs of drip coffee makers including a parallel development in America called the Drip-o-later in 1920. This was a non-electric device that allowed for brewing an entire pot of drip coffee. It still required you to heat up a separate kettle on the stove. 

The first major step forward was the Melitta filter in 1907. Made from a brass pot and blotter paper this made pourover drip brewing much more convenient. In 1936 Melitta developed their now ubiquitous cone shaped filter the 102. Melitta launched the filtered coffee revolution, and is still a brand name today.

Until the 1950's, all electric coffee brewing was percolated, the electric percolator appearing in 1905. That changed when Wigo introduced the Wigomat, the first automatic electric drip brewer in 1954. The Wigomat not only was the first electric drip brewer, but it was the first with the features we associate with drip brewers today. Due to its design, many firms such as AEG, Solis, Melitta, and Douwe Egberts licensed the design for distribution. Douwe Egberts was a notable distributor of the Wigomat. After the patents on the design expired, manufacturers began cloning variants, making improvements, simplifying the design, and offering a cheaper product. The company Wigo is now defunct.

But lets wind back the clock to the late 1960s, where Technivorm emerges as a name in coffee brewing. Douwe Egberts, a coffee distributor who wanted to sell more coffee, had interest in a coffee machine that could brew better coffee. Gerard Smit, who had already gained Douwe Egberts attention with their KM1 coffee grinder, was asked if he could design a better coffee brewer and in 1969 the first Moccamaster type 68 was released. Moccamasters continued to rapidly evolve and improve in each model until 1974 (or 1976), which saw the release of the type 74 model which is later called the KB-741.

I find it fascinating that you can draw an almost direct line from the first electric coffee maker to technivorm, and you can see how it was improved and stayed high quality since 1974.

If anyone has any more information on the history of drip brewing or the history of the Wigomat please feel free to chime in. Very little information survives from this era.

1ragcyp,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestructiveReaders/comments/1ragcyp/1225_throne_of_ash_and_feathers_urban_fantasy/,[1225] Throne of Ash and Feathers; Urban Fantasy,"Hi there, I'm trying to follow through with a story idea for the first time. I've been playing with this trio for a couple years now and have finally sat down to see it to completion. My brain has a hard time staying on track with the outline, and I feel like my grammar is needing some work. I've invited my friends to read what I've written so far (I'm up to 9 chapters thus far, and this is Chapter 1) and I'd like some unbiased critiques.



Chapter 1

Mara Vale was having a perfectly acceptable day, and this was unfortunately a tactical error. Acceptable days were traps. They wrapped you in the illusion of calm, like when the sky outside becomes yellow, hinting at peace, right before a thunderstorm rages across the atmosphere.

Mara was always suspicious of a yellow sky, she was doubly suspicious of an acceptable day.

She watched the coffee in her cup settle into stillness as the cafe around her bustled with life. A mother was wrestling with her screaming child, a woman read a book close by, and a nurse on break tapped away on his laptop. Mara used to despise being in public. She always felt watched, but now she knew she was just a part of the background like everyone else.

But today was different…the barista had pronounced her name right, “Mar-ah” instead of “Mare-uh”. Even the spelling was immaculate this time, no extra h at the end. She smiled at this, remembering the time that the barista had written, “Mariah??” on the cup. She had been coming to this small cafe in the hub of this small town since it had opened, and her heart swelled with pride that the barista had finally remembered these little things.

She closed her hazel eyes and tried to drown out all of the sounds before she stared at the blank sketchbook before her. Instead she let her other senses take over; the smell of freshly ground coffee beans rushing into her sinuses, the warmth from the ovens in the back humbly baking the goods that would be put out on display within the hour. With a relaxing of her shoulders she let herself dissolve into the pocket of peace she found within the chaos and began to sketch, her brown shoulder length waves rustling along with the loose movements of her arm and hand.

Eventually shapes began to appear on the blank pages, the woman reading the book, the nurse in deep concentration on his laptop and the mother who had finally managed to calm her child. The pencil flowed along the pages as she recorded the people around her in their own uniqueness. She tried to ignore the way her skin seemed to itch, almost as if the air was static and pressing too closely against her.

The timer on her phone sang out and she startled for a second before turning it off and looking down at the page before her.

Five minute sketch practice completed, she smiled to herself as she leaned back to stretch in her chair and take a sip of the chocolate flavored espresso drink she always ordered.

Despite the heat pressing against the glass outside she still liked her drink hot, and relished as it hit the back of her throat. She sat in thought for a moment, wondering how her interview would go today, and setting down her mocha, she checked her phone.

Soon, the numbers seemed to say to her. It was time to exit the pocket of peace she had formed and get ready to head to a possible new future position in a small studio. She daydreamed briefly of curating art and learning from the director she had come to know over the past couple of months. Little did she know that was all about to go out the window. Literally.

Mara stood up to leave, but perked a suspicious eyebrow at her cup when she saw it start to vibrate and cast little waves within itself, like someone had thrown a small stone into it.

She looked around to see if maybe the child had renewed its unfounded grief and tossed something. And that’s when she felt it. A small hum accompanying the undercurrents of the bustling noises of the cafe. The hair on her arms stood up as if electricity floated through the air. The pastry case seemed to take on a life of its own and distorted ever so slightly. It was as if she was looking through a prismatic window covering.

Nope, I’m not dealing with this today, she thought to herself, accusing her brain of a possible migraine.

She slung her bag over her shoulder and grabbed her drink to head to her car to take some headache medicine before this important meeting she had, but she froze.

The air pulsed.

Everyone paused, including the infant. Heads seemed to simultaneously turn in the same direction towards the pastry case.

The air cracked and the atmosphere seemed to hiccup.

The nurse snapped his laptop shut ready to run out the door, the woman dropped her book, and the mother grabbed her kid and dashed out the front door.

Mara was frozen in place and silently cursing at her legs to move. Her eyebrows knitting together in confusion as the air in front of the case twisted and distorted, almost as if cellophane was lit on fire without a flame at her eye level. It bent and shimmered and then folded inward before tearing open in a bright opalescent light.

She held her hand up to shield her eyes and staggered backwards when a man fell out of the light with a painful thud. He hit the ground shoulder first and cursed as he quickly righted himself into a defensive stance. His eyes were wide and wild, and….golden?? She blinked to try and focus better and his eyes caught hers. She felt a thrill of panic zip up her spine. Wild and shaggy deep red hair with black roots framed the man’s alert gaze. Mara felt her mouth go dry and realized it was hanging open before clamping it shut. His shirt was torn, his legs were fitted in black jeans and heavy boots stabilized him on the ground.

He stayed crouched until someone screamed and he exploded into action. Before Mara could even think the air behind him bent again in that very odd way and a shockwave burst forward. The man caught her by the wrist as everyone was pushed by the force, and the two of them were thrown through the front glass of the cafe. Mara groaned, trying to yank her arm free.

“Hey!! Let me go, what the hell is going on?!” she yelled as she clawed at his hand. He regarded her for a second as he stood and pulled her to her feet, and then he glanced back at the cafe as a growling hiss came from the dust.

“What is that?” she asked looking at the man, her normally olive skin going pale.

“That,” he said, studying her again, “That’s bad.”

There was the sound of something pulling itself along the ruined cafe tiles, it sounded big. Mara’s eyes widened as the shape of a dinosaur sized alligator materialized in the broken cafe window. She took a step back and so did the man.

“Why did it have to take that form, shit!” the man griped before yanking Mara out of the way as the beast lunged. She yelped and knew her shoulder was going to be sore tomorrow. Tourists and locals around them screamed and scattered in different directions, bright colored clothing blurring around them. The Florida heat squeezed against them as they stumbled out of the way of the beast.

Mara knew she shouldn’t have trusted such a perfectly acceptable day.",0,1771644221.0,DestructiveReaders,1,0.5,False

It was crazy and scary, but I hear it’s unusual, so I am determined not to let it stop me from touring the city with our son. I’m street smart and know all the head-on-a-swivel tips, but it does have me wanting to be sure I stay in the safest places, especially with my child in tow. (Though I thought SoHo was safe last time. The attack was on Houston St near a coffee shop that was ranked top ten in the city…but has a methadone clinic nearby.)

I’ve searched on YouTube, TikTok, and Kwai with no success. I’ll describe everything I remember as clearly as possible.
It was a well-made internet animation with an artistic, slightly surreal style, but it also had dark humor. Most of the story took place inside a café at night. The setting was clearly drawn (not realistic), with a somewhat strange and moody atmosphere.
The animation started with a small character that looked like a white cat entering the café. There was also another character who seemed to be a white cat. Inside the café, there was a tall, thin character sitting at a table drinking coffee. He reminded me of SCP-3008 because of his tall and slim appearance, but he had a face and was stylized, not fully human-looking.
At some point, the waitress begins acting inappropriately toward the smaller character who is trying to order something. The tall man who was sitting at the table seems annoyed by the situation, pulls out a gun, and shoots at her. However, the shot accidentally hits a boiler that was already unstable, causing a large explosion in the café.
After the explosion, two characters appear exploring the ruins of the café. One of them looked very similar to the Roblox “noob” character. In another scene, there is a female character who asks them to end her suffering, and shortly after that, the animation ends. There was no explicit blood shown, but the tone became darker in that part.
I remember watching this animation on Kwai, and possibly also seeing it on YouTube or TikTok, but I’m not sure where it was originally uploaded. I don’t remember the channel name, the title, or any specific dialogue. It might have been deleted or become lost media.
If anyone recognizes this animation or knows what it might be, I would really appreciate the help.",1,1771644038.0,animation,0,1.0,False

1rag9hr,https://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/1rag9hr/highest_bac_ever_recorded_is_1374_without_medical/,Highest BAC ever recorded is 1.374 without medical care,"Now, i checked some stats recently, was just interested in what the body can take when it comes to the booze.

There's a record in the Guinness Book of World Record from 2013: A man in Poland had a BAC of 1.374, which was measured after he crashed his truck (or car, depends on the source).

There's another one of BAC 1.48, but this guy died from the crash or, another source says, there was a man with a similiar BAC that survived in the ICU of the hospital.

Some other ""facts"" were never proven, like Andre the Giant drinking 100 beers in a row without a break. But he was special with gigantism anyway, he wasn't called a giant without a reason, he used alcohol as painkiller. Still, there are no details around, like the alc. vol. of the beers, the size of the bottles etc. and so, i doubt this story.

Just for the stats: For ordinary people, the sources are around BAC 0.4 that means acute alcohol intoxication and can be lethal. Sometimes less, sometimes more.

So... just wrote down some thoughts while i drink a cup of coffee with cherry liquor. If you reach such levels of BAC, you get awarded the Alcoholics Iron Cross 1st Class with Swords, Diamonds and Oak Leaves.

I find it very interesting how the body is able to adapt to substances, even toxins like arsenic, and can make you survive amounts that would immediately kill a normal person.

For me, i don't know my highest BAC. As i don't drive a car and use public transport in Switzerland, never had a DUI. My confrontations with the police were not because of alcoholism. So it was never measured.

Most of my time is also polytox, which requires less alcohol to get you hammered when you have other drugs in your body.

But am i the only one that probably had the highest BAC on a binge when it wasn't measured? When nothing bad happened, that the police or hospital would check the BAC?

P.S.  
For info, in many countries of Europe, you don't use BAC. You use Promille to measure the alcohol in the blood. BAC 0.5 means 5 Promille. So when i joined the sub, i was very confused about some guys here, they were like ""Had .05 in the DUI"", i thought it was promille and that would be the legal limit to drive a car here in my place.",5,1771643941.0,cripplingalcoholism,9,0.86,False

I buckle my seatbelt as Val gets into the driver’s seat and closes the door, the gas light’s still on. 

She catches me staring at it. “It’s fine,” she says this a lot, “I get paid tomorrow so I’ll just fill it up then.” She starts the car and backs out of the parking lot. Guess Jade isn’t coming again. 

I stare out the window again, watching things blur as she talks about her day. How the test went, a project, a theory that Jade has a “candy plug.” Then she goes quiet, resting her elbow on the window, so I decide to speak instead. I have questions about today. It was weird.

“Hey, Val?” I say once she slows at a red light. She hums, noncommittal. My words come out slowly, “What did you and Jade mean when you said ‘that’s how it happens?” A slow smile spreads across her face as she leans her head against her hand and looks at me like she’s expecting more. I try to clarify. “You know about the eye contact thing?” She just smiles harder. 

I shift away in my seat, looking everywhere but her. 

Window. 

Seat. 

Dashboard. 

Until she faces the front again and I relax against my seat again. 

The light changes and she eases forward again, not saying anything. Why won’t she say anything? I finally said, “What if there was a girl?”  
She gasps, “I knew it!” She clears her throat, “I mean-” she bites back a smile, “Go on.”  
Go on? That was all I had to say. There was a girl this morning. Then in class. I just watch her, blinking when she looks over at me. Once. Twice. 

She raises a brow, “Why aren’t you saying anything?” She seems mildly frustrated, maybe confused, “You said there was a girl,” her words and slow as she gestures for me to keep going but I just nod my head along with her. She sinks back into her seat after a turn, rubbing a hand down her face, groaning, “Ugh. You don’t know what to feel, do you?” She sounds tired, but there’s a faint smile, which makes me smile, too. ‘Tired of me’ I guess-but not actually. 

Feel? What do I feel? She was nice and talked to a lot of people. So I tell her as much. She gasps again.

“Wait,” she holds a hand out, but keeps an eye on the road, “Was she that girl from the other day. The one you keep saying was ‘super sweet’ or something?”

I don’t think I said that. 

I agree anyway, smiling a bit, “Yes. That’s her.” I turn to the window again and see an orange cat. 

Cute. I keep my eyes on it before Val speaks again.

She mumbles to herself, “Knew you’d like a sweet girl.” I don’t think she meant for me to hear. I’m about to ask when she waves it off, “Nothing!  Just- Happy for ya.” Her smile turns smug, like she knows something I don’t. 

“Are you happy because she’s nice?”

She shrugs half-heartedly, “Yeah. We could use more nice people.”   
Hm. “I am nice?” The thought is out before I can filter it. 

She smiles again as she pulls up to my apartment, parking before she jostles me.

“Only the nicest guy around!” She pulls a breathless laugh from me before letting me go and she leans back in her seat again, letting her smile fade. I glance at her again before I thank her and leave. 

I still hear the engine running as I start up the stairs, the clanging of the metal familiar to my ears. The sun finds my face and I squint, but it feels so warm I don’t mind. I look over my shoulder and see Val slowly pulling away and she waves a hand out the window at me as  I unlock the door and step inside. 

That was easier than I thought it would be.  
  


Azora-The Internship

The car rolls to a stop outside the library’s round step, making my breath catch. It’s my first day. My hair is starting to curl back up, but it’s still tamed by my hairpins. It sort of bothers me, but everything else is as it should be. 

My mom twists around in her seat to face me fully and her hair bounces freely over her shoulders. “Are you ready for your first day?” She looks steady, but her voice is laced with concern, “It’s okay if you’re a little nervous.”

My response comes naturally, “I’m not nervous Mom, just,” I struggle to find a word as my pulse picks up, “preparing, I’m preparing myself.” She nods, turning back around and my dad meets my eyes in the rearview mirror, trying to read me. 

We have a staring contest until he finally speaks, “Nervous or not,” he says, carefully, “You’re going to do great. You love this sort of thing.”

He’s right–I love organizing and asking questions and answering them and learning new things. This internship is going to open doors to more of that. The only problem is that I will undoubtedly need to speak to people and mom says I need to work on my “bedside manner.” She says I’m too analytical with things, like my dad, but he’s also nice and warm with people. I rather deal with numbers or organizing things without the people. 

A seatbelt unbuckles with a click, making me turn and my mom’s green eyes meet mine again as she struggles to form words. “Just,” she starts blinking rapidly, my dad places a hand on her arm and takes over, fully looking back at me now. 

“Look,” he starts, “We’re both very proud and we believe in you. You call us if you need anything, okay?” I agree even though I will not be calling. I won’t need them. I unbuckle my seatbelt, sling my messenger bag over my shoulder and open the door, “Bye guys, I’ll see you at 5:30.” I close the door and start up the steps. I’m only about halfway when I hear a faint whirr, with a sigh I keep going forward. Five steps, six. 

Then I hear my mom’s voice carry up the small walkway. “You can call us even if you don’t need anything, carino!” Why is she halfway out the window? Does she think I’m going to war? She shouts again,“I love you!” 

I hear my dad start fussing in Italian as he gets her to sit back in her seat.

His voice comes out tired, but he’s smiling anyway, “I tried to stop her, cara,” he sighs, “I love you, too.” He leans forward, waiting for me to say it back.

I pretend it hurts to say it, “I love you guys, too.” They smile and my dad starts up the car again and my mom looks back until the turn at the stop sign.

I steel myself as I turn back to the library, ready to start. I adjust my bag, forcing my hands steady and take in a breath. 

“You got this,” I tell myself. Then I remember Valerie and the project. She said she has work. Hm I should still tell her I’ll be busy in case she gets off work before I’m out. Without putting much more thought into it, I pull out my phone and send the text:



*I will be at my internship at the library until 5:30. Let me know when you get this or if you are available before then.*



Straight to the point, concise. Very productive, I shouldn’t need more than that. Finally, I push open the tall chocolate brown doors and I’m welcomed by the smell of old paper, and coffee. I stifle a sneeze as I take in some dust. Maybe I could start there when it comes to tasks? 

My flats glide across the hardwood floor as I take in the artwork on the walls and the lists of famous authors and their works. Multiple rows of bookshelves are spaced out and there’s a small reading corner, for children's storytime I assume. There are plenty of places to sit, as well as study corners or closed off areas. Valerie and I could come here for the project. We could get a lot done in an environment like this–she might actually focus. 

A woman with a messy bun might as well float with how gracefully she moves as she makes her way to me. “You must be Azora!” She shakes my hand, “Welcome to your first day, how are you liking it so far?” 

I take in the library again before answering, “I like it,” I decide, “It seems like a great place to get work done, but is also a good place to go if you just want peace and quiet.” 

She nods along with my words, smiling when I finish. “That is what I was going for when I designed it. I wanted everyone to find what they were looking for.” She hooks her arm into mine, making me stiffen. “Let’s get you started with logging checked in books,” without another word she whisks me away.

Let the interning begin.   


Jade-Milkshakes  
I watch as The Spot pulls into view and Hutch parks, I can feel how crooked the car is before we even stop. “You can’t park,” I tell him flatly, “Like–at all.” 

He huffs before shifting the car back into reverse and he backs out to straighten it and I laugh, “Is it that serious to you?” 

He throws the car in park again and leans back in his seat, looking at me, “Yes.” He says dead serious until a smile tugs at his mouth, “Your words hurt and inspired me to park better. Congratulations.” He claps twice before he sees my stare and he laughs again. That’s all he does. Laugh and smile. 

I shake my head, letting it fall back against the seat. Are we not getting out? I turn to look at him and see he’s already looking at me. I blink at him, but I’m so tired I nearly nod off. He tilts his head, watching me closer–the weirdo and I blink again. 

He snorts, “You know something?” By the tone of his voice I can tell it’s gonna be dumb. “You blink slow as hell.” I just stare at him because there’s no way. He stares back, Blink. He slams a hand on his wheel before pointing at me, “See! That is so weird. Why do you do that?” 

I shrug, “I’m just blinking. You’re being dramatic, you weirdo,” I open the door and watch him scramble to get out, too.  

“The Spot” is scrawled across the sign in a loopy font, its neon light shines over the cars in the parking lot as I near the door. 

Hutch beats me there thanks to his longer strides and huffs, “Yeah? Well stop.” Then, almost seriously, he adds, “It’s disturbing.” The door jingles as it opens and I jab him in the ribs with my elbow as I pass him by and he laughs, rubbing his side as I beeline for a booth seat. The smell of burgers and fries fill the air and the kitchen doors swing open freely and the shouts of orders can be heard from inside, too. 

Old 80s music plays on the jukebox and Hutch bops his head along without even realizing making me smile before I can stop myself. He looks over and notices my eyes so I rest my head on my hand, focusing on the servers skating to each booth. Auntie says they’ve been doing that since she was in high school. Old habits, I guess. 

“Hey, uh,” he rests his arms on the table, “thanks for coming to, um, hangout.” He looks away as he rubs his neck. His ears tinge with pink, poor guy’s nervous. I don’t know why though–it’s just me. 

 I go to respond but our waiter comes by and asks what we would like. I let Hutch do it since he already knows what I want: a strawberry shake and fries. I make a face at his order, though. Mint chocolate chip milkshake. Ew, 

He smirks to himself at my reaction, not caring even a little bit. I finally decided to answer his question, “Don’t get too happy about me coming with you. I’m just here for the shake.” Right on time our order is handed to us. He glares at me as he sticks his straw in his cup and I stick my tongue out at him and he laughs into the straw.   

I grab a fry and dip it into mine and I watch as he scarfs down the others. Fricking barbarian. 

He coughs as he chokes on his shake and I laugh at him as he holds his head. “Brainfreeze,” he groans. 

“That’s what happens when you chug that nasty stuff.”

“You’re nasty,” he’s still staring at the table, trying not to smile.

“If you really thought I was nasty you wouldn’t have driven me here.” I watch his messy hair bounce as he pops his head back up while I stir my straw around my cup. 

He snaps up his cup, “Whatever” he mumbles, like a grumpy child. I can’t with him, he’s never serious–not really. He drinks the rest of it straight from the cup and licks his lips when he sits back up. 

Something on him catches the light. Is that a glint? His tongue swipes out again trying to get all the gross mint ice cream off his face. Does he have a tongue piercing? Since when? I furrow my brows trying to figure that out and he glances at me and notices.   
“Oh, yeah,” he slides his cup across from him, “I did it in tenth grade. I saw a video and was bored, so,” he shrugs like it’s nothing, but it makes so much sense. Of course he was bored. Of course he did it himself. 

All I can do is shake my head, but then I notice the streak of green and laugh. “What?” He’s already swiping at his face like he knows. “Did I get it?” He watches my face for an answer. 

“Absolutely not,” is all I say as I point at his chin and he grabs a napkin, ears pink again and he finally gets it. I just watch, leaning my head on my hand again with a faint smile. 

I’m glad I’m giving this another shot. 

Hangouts, I mean.

We’re just hanging out... right?

His eyes meet mine again and I sit up a bit and he goes to say something, but stops himself, instead asking if I’m going to eat the rest of the fries. 

I reach for my fries, “I’ll break your fingers if you touch any of them,” he lifts his hands immediately swearing not to touch them. 

We both know he’s going to have more than me by the time we leave. 

  
  


Melody- Dad’s Back

My hands are covered in pencil marks and fabric glue as I sit at my sewing machine. My freshly made mermaid dress sits on top of my mannequin ready for my client to pick it up. I finished it about ten minutes ago. It’s like 7 right now and my mind keeps racing with more and more ideas for these other orders– I already drew up three more designs. I know I should take a break or eat something, but I can’t bring myself to. I know I say this all the time but I really do love doing this. I probably should take a break, though, I’ve been at this for hours, but I refuse to stop–things have been too quiet lately. 

My stomach growls, making me wince, but I ignore it as I pull back what is going to be a sleeve for a soon-to-be floral dress, holding it up to the light when I hear a door closing from downstairs. Is that Mom with the mail? I shrug it off when I hear a deeper voice call out, “Yo, Mel!”

I freeze. Only one person’s ever called me that. “DAD?!” I hear his laugh echo from the staircase. I’ve missed the sound of it so much. 

I don’t slow down as I skid past the stairs and go down them two at a time until I see him and without warning I jump into his arms. His warm arms wrap around me when he catches me. He smells like gasoline, outside, and the truck he drives and his beard scratches at my face as he squeezes one last time before putting me down. 

His hand finds my head, making my messy bun even worse, “Say, have you grown? I swear you’re two inches taller,” He laughs when I smack his hands away. 

I stare up at him, “I haven’t grown in two years.” 

“Oh,” is all he says before adding, “Must be all the time on the road messing with my head.” Probably–he does drive different semi-trucks to and from different states for weeks at a time. 

He walks into the kitchen behind my mom, who already looks ridiculously happy. I notice the lavender flowers now in the trash, wilted. They only last a few weeks, but he always brings new ones when he comes back. They always last just long enough for him to get home and replace them.

Cabinets open with a slight creak and close with faint thuds as my dad asks Mom how he could help with dinner. 

She just groans, “Take your coat off. All I smell is that truck.” She rolls her eyes when he lets out a low laugh, “And your boots, too, you’re going to track mud through here.”  
He hangs his coat up above his boots, “Wouldn’t want that now would we.” He pats my mom’s shoulders, ignoring how she tries to shrug him off, asking what we’re doing for dinner. I’m about to say it’s either a pizza or noodles since that’s how it usually goes but Mom’s already looking into the fridge, asking how spaghetti and garlic bread sounds. Oh, okay, then. Nevermind. 

He hums in approval, “Anything made by you sounds amazing right now.” He asks again how he could help, but he gets sent to their bedroom.

“You can help by taking a shower first,” she smiles, “I can manage this on my own.” He grumbles about it, acting upset before he makes a grab for me and I squeal trying to get away as he gives me a noogie. He hums when he dips his head down to give my forehead a kiss, “You wanna show me what you’ve made when I get out?” Yes! Of course I do! He doesn’t even need to ask! 

“Yes! I made like– three new designs! You’ll love them!” I want to info-dump so bad, but Mom gives him a look and he lets me go, making his way back to her, leaving a kiss on her forehead, too. She leans into it before pushing him away again, but he just grabs her hand, kissing the back of it, too before promising to go ‘scrub the road off him.’ She laughs, shaking her head as she pulls out a pot and I run over to the pantry, grabbing the spaghetti packs to help her get started.

I can’t help but steal glances as my mom moves throughout the kitchen, humming some song under her breath. It’s crazy how much of a difference that my dad makes for her. I reach up to grab the plates as she boils the water and I set the table, hearing the rush of water coming from down the hall. I can’t stop smiling, things feel normal again. I love when dad’s back. 



Valerie’s POV– Back at the House

I slam my car door shut and throw my head back against the seat with a deep groan. I’m so tired and it’s like–7:30. I’m still not home. I didn’t even have time to check my phone the whole time because they put me on the register. I was not trying to talk to people today and one lady said I looked like a bad influence. Thanks for the random opinion I didn’t ask for I guess. 

With a sigh, I buckle my seatbelt and begrudgingly start my car, but the engine stalls. “Come on,” I turn the key again and it roars to life. 

Thank God. 

I back out and reach for my phone. 

One message. 

Okay, cool, I can check it later. 

I’m about halfway home when I see neon lights up ahead–The Spot. Wow. I haven’t thought about that place in years. Mom used to take me there and we’d have milkshake races, but not anymore. Things are so different now. 

I miss her. Too much, probably. 

My headlights shine across my driveway as my house comes into view and the familiar feeling of dread washes over me.  I don’t want to be here either, but I’m too tired to go anywhere else, so I cut the engine and saunter to the door. Pressing my ear to it, I check for anything going on inside. I think we’re clear, I open the door and that same sour smell greets me again. I close it behind me and notice a figure moving around with soft thuds following its every move. Dad. I watch as he looks under the couch. Is he looking for something? 

Then I hear it. “Sabrina?” He huffs, voice low as he gets up again, still mumbling her name as he walks past me, peeking into their room. He hasn’t been there since... He walks past me again, going towards my room and the hallway but this time he looks in my direction. Once. Twice. 

Now he sees me. “Oh!” He gets closer, “Have you seen your mother? I think she’s hiding from me–” He hasn’t asked this in a long time. How much did he drink this time?

I just stare up at him, unable to believe any of this. Maybe I’m dreaming–I fell asleep in the car and I’m dreaming, right? He’s just drunk on the couch again or puking in the bathroom. He stalks down the hall, stumbling a bit on the way as he keeps calling my mother’s name. “Sabrina! Sabrina, where are you? Are you playing hide and seek?”

He finally turns the light on, taking in the state of the room with glassy eyes. “Wow,” he scratches the back of his neck, “It’s a mess in here.” 

“A mess” doesn’t even begin to describe it. I gave up on trying to keep it clean long ago–he kept making it dirty again right after and I hated it. I still hate it, I want to turn the lights back off. 

My dad’s still smiling when he asks, “Valerie? Do you know where your mother is? She’s hiding so well,” he chuckles again, but he sounds unsure.

My vision blurs at the question. I know where she is. I also know that she’ll never be back. I look to the floor, “She’s gone, Dad.” My voice wavers and silence fills the room once more. “She’s gone.” I say almost to myself. 

I force my head back up and see his puzzled face as my dad backs up into the couch and scratches his head. “Gone? Where is she, I mean– It’s late...”  he trails off, wondering what time it actually is. 

“You’re still drunk.” I scoff to myself in disbelief. No wonder he got to wander around looking for his wife again.

I look at him again and he’s blankly staring back at me, still waiting on me to explain. I blink the tears away. “She’s gone, okay?” My voice doesn’t sound like me. Sabrina’s gone. 

He looks around confused, “When will she be back?” He tries to laugh it off, but I raise my hand to stop him. I can’t take much more of this. If the tears start they won’t stop.

“Mom isn’t coming back,” my hands shake as memories try to flood back, but I shake my head, forcing them away. “She’s-” I can’t make myself say it.

I never could. 

It still doesn’t feel real. 

My dad has his head in his hands now, tugging at the strands as he tries to grapple with this. I lean against the front door to steady myself, when I feel my knees buckle. 

“No.” comes his voice from the couch. My head snaps back up. “No. Why is  she gone?” His voice raises even more and he slams a hand on the coffee table. “Why is she gone?!” I flinch back, my breathing uneven. He gets to his feet and swipes a bottle off the ground, popping it open. “I’ll ask again, kid. Where. Is. She.” 

My grief is joined by fear as I slide against the wall, slowly pushing myself towards my room. I know I have to answer this. It’ll just get worse otherwise. “She’s dead, Dad.”

I choke on a sob, “Mom is dead.” He goes silent. “Sabrina is dead.” I watch as he fights both his confusion and rage and hot tears run down my face. 

They’re the warmest thing in this house.

His emotions continue their battle. Rage wins. His murky eyes find mine, widening before he shakes his head. “Dead? No. That can’t be it.” He jumps to his feet, “She has to be here.” 

Stomping around he begins his search again, more desperate this time. 

I take my chance and run into my room, locking the door behind me, using my back to keep it closed when he knocks on it asking “Is Sabrina in there?” I bring my knees to my chest as I shake my head and say no and he groans and I hear his footsteps back away again. The tears flow freely now, but I bite my lip trying to stay as quiet as possible doing my best to ignore his pleas for Mom to ‘stop hiding.’ 

I wipe at my tears with the heel of my hand before I cover my ears, hoping to block my dad’s voice out. I can still hear him. 



Hutch’s POV–After Shakes

I’m still smiling like an idiot even after I dropped Jade off, like, thirty minutes ago. I still can’t believe she wanted to go out with me–Well not out, out, just out. Like a hangout because that’s all we did. Like, bros. 

...Yeah, I’m never saying that again. She’d laugh in my face if I said that with her around. The thought makes me smile harder and I lean into my left hand trying to force it away, but it just makes it worse. I can still hear all her laughs. 

Hm. Should I text her? Or is that too much? Normally I’d ask Rudy but I can’t for obvious reasons. Sighing I pop open the console and pull out a bag of chocolate and pop one in my mouth. Yeah, I’ll tell her when I get home and see if she responds. If not, I’ll live...probably. Hey, candy solves all. 

I see my neighborhood come into view so I reach into my pocket, grabbing my phone and unlock it before pulling into the driveway. I immediately text saying that I’m back with lightning speed. I think I need to work on my self control. Huh. I can start tomorrow.

I look back at the chat and see the bubbles appear. 

Then they leave. 

Oh... 

Alrighty then.

I pocket my phone and get out of the car, wincing at the sudden chill in the air. I mean it is like 9PM or something. Wow, were we really at the diner that long? It felt much shorter. 

I knock and Mom gets the door, immediately asking if I left my housekey. I try to deny it for all of three seconds before I sigh and say I did and she shakes her head. I tire this poor woman out daily at this point. I find my housekey, but abandon it once I smell dinner.

“Mmm.” I hum, “What are you making?” I lean over the counter trying to get a peek. It’s crazy how I’m still starving.

She laughs, “You mean the dinner I already made while you were out?” She rests her hand on her hip, raising a brow. “Why were you out so late anyway?” Hm, what an excellent question mother.  
I go to answer, but my grandma enters the room, taking a million steps as she passes me, singing, “She’s only asking because you’re red as roses.” I bring my hands to my face and yep–they’re warm. Is it really my fault, though? I feel we should be blaming Jade.

Instead I say, “It was kind of cold outside,” Grandma just goes ‘mhm’ under her breath as she grabs plates. “And I had a really great time,” I add, looking in the opposite direction.” 

Mom’s expression softens as she comes around, leaning up to pinch my cheek. “You hear that! Was it a girl?” I made a mistake. Someone save me. She gasps, “Was it that girl you were crushing on back in–” 

Moving her hand, I cut in, “It was just a hangout. Like friends, you know?” I give an uneasy smile because I don’t know how much I believe it myself. 

Grandma scoffs and the cups clink as she sets them at the table. “Bet it only you two, huh?” How did she–

I know my face gave me away when my mom shrieked. “It was a date!” She claps her hands together. “That’s why you’re still blushing. Oh, that’s so cute!” She cups her own face as she continues gushing over it all. 

Grandma clears her throat and I see the plates in her hands and her raised brow. “Oh, right!” I scramble to get them from her and I grab the cups, too and set the table. I totally forgot. When I turn back toward her she hands me the pan, too. Mm. Lasagna.  I set that on the table as well and grab the water pitcher. 

“Wait,” I freeze with the pitcher in hand. “The girl didn’t happen to have pink hair now did she?” I mentally curse myself out. You’re kidding. Why does she remember her?

Hesitantly, I answered her, “Her hair might’ve been just slightly pink?” My voice went up an octave. 

“The girl you’ve liked since middle school?!” Mom’s jaw drops. “That’s amazing! I’m so happy for you!” She pinches both of my cheeks this time. 

I grumble, “I didn’t have a crush on her the entirety of middle school, Mom.” Just you know– most of it. 

“Ha!” Comes from the table, “Boy, please. You’ve liked her for all of 8th grade,” as if that wasn’t enough she adds, “And that’s being generous.” She laughs again. Ugh. Why do these people know everything?

Begrudgingly I grab the utensils and set them by the plates and fill the glasses before sitting down. “So what if I’ve liked her since then?” Why do I feel defensive? “It was just a little crush back then.” I can’t meet either of their eyes when I mutter this. 

Mom rests her hand in her hand, still smiling. “That’s how it all starts,” she says dreamily before cutting the lasagna and giving a slice that’s noticeably bigger than her own.   
I guess she’s not too wrong about it all. Tonight did feel a little different. That could just be wishful thinking, though. I slide my phone out of my pocket and take a peek. Still nothing. Cool, that’s fine. I do my best not to let it bother me as I take a bite. 

The taste and warmth of it all bursts across my tongue and I shake my head in disbelief. My mom’s cooking is the best around.

1rag23q,https://www.reddit.com/r/trustedhousesitters/comments/1rag23q/ever_thought_about_cutting_a_sit_short/,Ever thought about cutting a sit short?,"Hello all!

Currently on week 1 of a 3 week sit in Mexico that I had been looking forward to for months. Although not the most clean, the house is beautiful and the 6 (yes, 4 cats and 2 dogs!) pets here are super easy to care for. In fact, the pets are the least of my worry and I prefer sitting for multiple animals. I have been pet and house sitting for years, but this is only my 3rd sit on THS and first out of the US. I believe this is the HO’s first time on the app, but I wanted to give it a shot because I had no reviews at the time either. Communication with the HO was great during the application process and up until I arrived. I felt super lucky to snag this sit since it was my first time in Mexico and coincided right after a friend’s bday trip in Cancun. 

The first issue arose when they texted me 3 days before the sit telling me that they had to postpone their flight from a Monday to a Thursday. For me, that was no problem as things happen and she was gracious enough to still let me come on Monday since my bus ticket was already booked and paid for. However, as soon as I walked inside the home, I saw an interior camera pointing right at the entrance. This should have been red flag #1, but the home situation is a bit interesting. It seems to me like they own a house and converted a couple buildings in the back of their home to rent out to tenants. A few of those tenants use either the main house entrance or garden to enter, so I shook off the camera issue even though it violates THS policies. But now, I can’t help but feel paranoid that there are other interior cameras even though I’m used to them from professionally house sitting in my home state. I also noticed the bathroom essentials are lacking (one towel, no soap/shampoo/conditioner etc.) but didn’t want to sound like a princess. There is a coffee machine but no coffee to make with it. I travel light and must have been spoiled with my two other amazing sits! 

I had 3 days to familiarize myself to the home and pets, but unfortunately, the HO was super busy leading up to her trip and never showed me where most of the pet food was, where the trash cans are, or how to turn on the hose (thought it would be easy!), so I was sorta at a loss while reading her instructions after she left yesterday. Thankfully, she is easy to communicate with but I hate having to bother her for such simple tasks. Her tenants/neighbors are very helpful but I do wish I had a little more privacy. If I knew she had all these tenants, I would not have applied. I feel useless and feel like there’s always an eye on me. 

Just a few hours ago, the HO informed me that two people were at the front and were coming by to look at and purchase a door. I was never told any information about a door or where it was and really would have appreciated a heads up on this to prepare. I have somewhat of a working proficiency in Spanish, but not enough to keep up with fast everyday conversations, so I had trouble communicating with the people at the front. I measly opened the door for them and led them to the garden to find the door they were purchasing, but wish she had taken care of this matter prior to leaving or even having one of her tenants help. I had no idea where the door was actually located in the garden, but thankfully, they were able to spot it. As the people were looking at the door, a person who I believe is the housekeeper, walks in and sternly tells me that I shouldn’t be leaving the doors open at night (the screen door was closed and locked) and all lights should be off so people don’t go looking inside the windows. I am used to leaving a lamp or two on until I go to bed and wished the HO would have communicated this request to me sooner if that’s what they had wanted for me to do. I just feel helpless as I’m typing this and not sure why they even wanted a sitter since it seems their tenants and neighbors tend to help out with the home and animals too. 

I really have no one to vent to about this that would possibly understand the situation I’m in, so apologies for the length. A part of me wants to just cut my sit short and go back home, but I made a commitment and don’t want this to tarnish my THS reviews. It’s hard for me to seriously consider leaving when I do not have any serious safety concerns nor severe home issues, and I would hate to leave the job undone. I just feel deeply uncomfortable here and feel as if I’m more of a burden than of any assistance. On the bright side, the city I am staying in is beautiful with rich culture and the friendliest people. The heat is crazy but what I really wasn’t expecting was the mosquitoes and allergies I would get!

Have you ever cut a sit short or thought about it? I would love to hear your stories and experiences! Regardless, this has already been such a great learning experience for me and will help me figure out what my ideal sits are for the future. Clearly, I am not on my ideal sit at the moment but have had wonderful past experiences. 😅",1,1771643330.0,trustedhousesitters,7,0.67,False

I've recently gained a passion for fitness, but I'm not allowed to go for a walk in the neighborhood or go to the gym. I'm not allowed to have a job, so I can't make my own money (not because she 'forbids' me from working, but because she wants me to enjoy the benefits of being young and having no responsibilities; I appreciate this, but I feel like I should at least have the OPTION of getting a job if I say I want one).

I have a car but not my license, and it's taking FOREVER to get my license. She said, even if I get my license, that doesn't mean I'm ready to drive to JUST my school, which IMO is a super easy commute; I see her do it everyday. I had expressed my desire to immediately start going to the gym ASAP when I got my license, and she said she didn't really want me going there... or driving around just for fun... or going out at night... what CAN I do??

I'm not allowed to go to a friend's house besides like 2 of them, and one of them I don't even care for that much anymore. She always says, ""I don't know the kids or the parents!"" but refuses to attempt to talk to the parents, neither through call/text or IRL. I'm not exactly encouraged to stay after school and join a club either because she insists that I focus on studying, but also because it would be my parents that have to pick me up. And no, a friend cannot drive me home either, because I'm not allowed to be in a car with a friend or their parents.

Likewise, I can't have friends over (not super often, anyway) because she wants the house to be totally spotless and clean every time. I think that's kinda fair though? But she has really high expectations; I think our house always looks lovely.

I also don't think she likes that I have discord. She and I share bedroom walls, and if she hears me talking to someone, she'll call me into the room and interrogate me about the person I'm talking to. The last time this happened, she was convinced that this one guy was trying to groom me; she called me stupid in an impressive different amount of ways and ultimately made me block my friend.

She has access to my Instagram and uses it all the time, so I can't do anything on there. I've made a second Instagram account but I'm scared to have it on my phone if she ever looks at it randomly (not that she has before, but I'm paranoid she will). I changed the email my Discord was associated with and changed the password too and only use it in a random browser that I usually never use, and in incognito. I'm scared she'd look through the service provider stuff and find out through there or something... Hell, I don't even like googling my random stupid questions because she always randomly uses my phone to take pictures or google something.

Just to list off more random thing: I'm ""discouraged"" from closing my door and having 2 earbuds in, not allowed to go to bed until she does because she wants me to put her things away for the day, I HAVE to get up when she does (on weekends/breaks) because I have to do all the morning tasks (letting dogs outside/eat, turn on lights, open blinds, make coffee, a lot more)... etc.

I'm also not allowed to cook anything. She doesn't like doing more dishes but I'm also not allowed to do the dishes because she ""doesn't like how I do them"" even though I've never done them. I wanna start learning how to cook healthy meals, because I mostly just eat healthy snacks instead of meals lol

Anyhow, am I overreacting??? I don't wanna confront her because she'll probably just yell about it like she has before. I love her and I know she thinks she's protecting me, but I feel like I'm behind socially and suck at navigating things and yada yada. Any time I bring it up she's just like ""I'm doing this to protect you !! Don't be so NAIVE"" and things like that, but I'm getting really annoyed at this point. I'm 20 and I feel like I can do what I want. I appreciate any advice she has for me but it sounds ridiculous to say ""my mom won't let me"" at 20.",3,1771643281.0,AIO,29,1.0,False
