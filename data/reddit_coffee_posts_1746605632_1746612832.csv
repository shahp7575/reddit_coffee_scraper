I spilled coffee on my 2020 MacBook Pro today. I saw on reddit people recommended opening it myself since it’s no longer under warranty and to try dry it as much as possible.

In doing so I accidentally turned it on and it smoked up a bit and smells horrid. I’m assuming short circuit.

I don’t know enough about electronics but I have some very important work on here and have not backed it up. I dont mind if I have to buy a new laptop, I’m just desperate for the data.

Any advice or recommendations about what I can do from here would be greatly appreciated

Thankyou

probably sometime after sunrise.  
probably after you said *“you won’t last”* and I said *“watch me.”*

It started off innocent enough:  
the Skype glow softening your face in the morning light,  
my webcam grainy from the cross-country connection,  
your voice just brushing the edge of tenderness.

By hour fifteen, I was gritting my teeth and blasting EDM.  
By hour twenty-one, my limbs started to ache.  
I thought:

*“This is what love is.*  
*A haze.*  
*A dare.*  
*A boy who keeps me awake just by* ***breathing into my headphones***.”

You probably played some video game, chugged cups of coffee.  
I stopped blinking.  
My head lolled like a broken marionette.  
You kept checking to see if I was still there.  
I was.  
I wouldn’t break first.  
I couldn’t lose.

I’d already laughed myself breathless underneath you,  
let you bite my neck purple,  
worn knee socks and peach chapstick like a spell,  
traced *I love you* into your chest,  
and let the silence echo louder than any answer.

By hour twenty-eight, I was trembling.  
By hour thirty-two, I couldn’t feel my face.  
My stomach churned.  
I whined involuntarily.  
You started sounding frustrated — *guilty*, even.  
You told me to stop,  
said it wasn’t funny anymore.

The game had turned into something else,  
something you couldn’t name,  
something that made you uncomfortable in your own skin.

So I did.  
I let you win.  
Not because I *really* lost,  
but because you sounded shocked  
at how much pain I was willing to bear for you.

I remember wearing your clothes like a confession,  
red dye bleeding into my bathtub,  
singing through tears at tech week like it didn’t mean anything.

I thought maybe this was it.  
This was what ruined me.

And even in bliss with someone who loves me better,  
I still smile.  
I still ache.

I still feel wide awake.

1kgtgo7,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/1kgtgo7/boost_your_mental_math_simple_daily_habits_that/,Boost Your Mental Math: Simple Daily Habits That Actually Work,"Have you ever watched someone quickly calculate a tip or split a bill in their head and thought, ""I wish I could do that""? You're not alone! As someone who struggled with mental math for years, I've discovered that this isn't some magical talent—it's a skill anyone can develop with the right approach.

# Why I Decided to Improve My Mental Math

Last year, I found myself constantly reaching for my phone calculator for simple calculations. During a job interview, when asked to do some quick calculations, I froze up completely. That embarrassing moment became my turning point.

Mental math isn't just about impressing others—it's about:

* Building confidence in everyday situations
* Saving precious time during exams and tests
* Developing deeper intuition for numbers and patterns
* Keeping your mind sharp (think of it as CrossFit for your brain!)

# Simple Techniques That Transformed My Mental Math

# 1. Start With Your Foundation

I realized I had gaps in my basic knowledge. Before learning fancy tricks, make sure you're comfortable with:

* Addition facts (especially combinations that make 10)
* Multiplication tables (at least up to 12×12)
* Place values and how numbers work together

**Real-life example:** When adding 47 + 36, I first combine 40 + 30 = 70, then 7 + 6 = 13, and finally 70 + 13 = 83. Breaking it down makes it manageable!

# 2. Mental Shortcuts That Actually Work

These are my go-to shortcuts that don't require being a math genius:

# Multiplying by 11

To multiply any two-digit number by 11: Add the digits and place the result between them.

* 42 × 11 = 4(4+2)2 = 462
* 75 × 11 = 7(7+5)5 = 825

# Quick Squaring

For numbers ending in 5:

* 25² = 2×3 followed by 25 = 625
* 45² = 4×5 followed by 25 = 2025

# The ""Close to 100"" Trick

For multiplying two numbers close to 100:

* 98 × 97 = (100-2)(100-3) = 100² - 100×2 - 100×3 + 2×3 = 10000 - 200 - 300 + 6 = 9506

# 3. My Simple Daily Practice Routine

You don't need hours—consistency is key. Here's my 10-minute daily routine:

* **Morning coffee challenge:** 5 quick calculations while waiting for coffee to brew
* **Commute game:** Mental addition of license plate numbers
* **Shopping workout:** Estimating my grocery total before checkout
* **Evening review:** 5 minutes practicing one new technique

# How to Track Your Progress

I keep a small notebook where I track:

* How many calculations I can do in 1 minute
* My accuracy percentage
* New techniques I've mastered
* Real-life situations where I used mental math successfully

Seeing my improvement keeps me motivated on tough days!

# Common Mistakes I Made (So You Don't Have To)

* **Trying too much too soon:** Start with 5-10 minutes daily, not marathon sessions
* **Neglecting fundamentals:** Make sure your basic facts are solid before advanced techniques
* **Giving up after mistakes:** Everyone makes errors—they're learning opportunities!
* **Not applying in real life:** Use your skills for bills, cooking measurements, and shopping

# Make It Fun (Because Boring Practice Doesn't Stick)

* Challenge friends to mental math ""duels""
* Use apps like ""Math Workout"" or ""Elevate"" that gamify practice
* Set personal records and celebrate small wins
* Reward yourself after hitting milestones

# From Someone Who's Been There

The most important thing I've learned is that mental math isn't about being ""naturally good with numbers."" It's about consistent practice and building confidence one calculation at a time.

Start today with just 5 minutes of practice, and I promise you'll see improvement within weeks. Your future self will thank you when you're confidently calculating tips, helping kids with homework, or impressing colleagues with your quick thinking!

Last night, duty ako. Night shift, together with other healthcare workers. Nilaanan ako ng food, ng higaan katabi nila, sobrang comfy pa nun kasi parang family nila talaga ako, hanggang sa naalimpungatan ako kasi kinumutan ako ng isang kasama ko (Female about 30’s age) they even gave me milk bago mag sleep kagabi.

Kinaumagahan, pinagtimpla ako ng coffee at pinakain ng pandesal. 🥺

Ngayon, before I go home, di na ako nagpa sundo sa boyfriend ko kasi naulan. Ayaw ko naman mabasa siya, so sabi ko commute na ako. Hanggang sa may huminto na trike sa harap ko, isa sa mga ka-work ko (M30’s).

Di naman need pero pinunasan pa ng sobra yung upuan, kahit na sinabi ko “okay na yan sir, kasi maliligo rin ako pag uwi” “hindi na, kasi basa upuan, nakakahiya”

nung pababa na ako, inaabot ko bayad kasi nagpapasada din siya eh, pero naghesitate siya. hanggang sa iniwanan ko bayad doon sa may lagayan ng pera sa trike haha. before I go inside, ang sabi,

“sige maam. ingat ka diyan” 

“thanks sir!”

even ngayong araw lang din, binigyan ako ng chocolates ng isa rin sa friend ko sa work.

so tell me, pano pa ako aalis niyan kung nakukuha ko princess treatment dito? :<

1kgtai7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1kgtai7/how_do_i_stop_spooking_my_coworkers/,How do I stop spooking my coworkers?,"I've been at this company for almost four years, in this specific office for about a year.

It's a large office and then out the door, down the hallway and around the corner is our kitchen. 

I have, within this past year, accidentally snuck up on and scared my coworkers about once a week every week.
They either don't anticipate me coming around the corner and get spooked, or they don't hear me enter the kitchen and get spooked or they will be standing in the way so I say excuse me and they get spooked!

I have tried so many things, I open and close doors loudly, I stomp my feet, I even added little metal plates to my shoes so my steps are louder. I've started humming little tunes any time I go to the kitchen, when approaching a corner I stay on the other side of the hallway so people can see me from further away and there's less risk of them bumping into me when I round the corner. When I enter the kitchen I loudly greet the people in there and they Still get spooked!

NOTHING works! People still get spooked by me ""suddenly appearing"" all the time!

It has happened three times by now that someone spilled their coffee when they got spooked by me, one of them even dropped their cup and broke it.

I always apologize and help clean up.

At first they all thought it was funny but they're starting to get annoyed with me.

I just don't know what else I could do? I'm not quite out of my emo phase so I still wear a choker, should I just attach a bell to it or is that too much? I honestly do not know what else I can do.

And I know to some this may sound like they're gaslighting me or this is a case of workplace bullying but I promise you it isn't, we get along great and I've been spooking people all my life so it's not a new problem",1,1746610910.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

1kgt8fc,https://www.reddit.com/r/richmaturemen/comments/1kgt8fc/rich_women_dating_in_bamfield_british_columbia/,"Rich Women Dating in Bamfield, British Columbia","Bamfield, British Columbia, is a small, secluded coastal village tucked into the west coast of Vancouver Island. Known for its breathtaking views, dense forest trails, and peaceful waters, it’s a paradise for nature lovers, but it’s also become something else in recent years—a quiet haven where successful, affluent women are choosing to live, love, and reconnect with themselves.

In a world where luxury is often defined by skyscrapers and social status, Bamfield offers a different kind of richness: emotional clarity, natural beauty, and meaningful human connection. That’s exactly why more wealthy, independent women are coming here—not only to escape the noise of urban life, but to find genuine relationships built on trust, shared values, and quiet elegance.

# Why Rich Women Are Choosing Bamfield

Affluent women—whether they’re CEOs, entrepreneurs, investors, or artists—are increasingly drawn to environments that offer both privacy and authenticity. In a place like Bamfield, there’s no paparazzi, no glitz, and certainly no pretension. Life is slower, quieter, and more real.

Many of these women have already reached the heights of professional success. They own property, they manage their wealth, and they’ve navigated the highs and lows of relationships. Now, they’re looking for something deeper. Bamfield, with its rustic charm and calming views of the Pacific Ocean, provides the perfect setting to explore emotional intimacy without the distractions of modern dating culture.

They aren’t here to flaunt their wealth—they’re here to find peace. And in that peace, many of them are also open to love.

# Who Are These Women?

The rich women dating or living in Bamfield are not a uniform group. Some are retired executives enjoying a slower pace of life. Others are remote-working entrepreneurs who can run businesses from their beachfront homes. Many are educated, well-traveled, and passionate about issues like environmental conservation, marine life, art, or wellness.

One might be a former investment banker now dedicating her time to sustainable fishing advocacy. Another could be a bestselling author writing her next novel from a cozy cedar cabin. What connects them is not just financial success—it’s a sense of purpose, depth, and independence.

They are women who know what they want—and what they no longer tolerate. Their approach to dating reflects this wisdom.

# What Rich Women in Bamfield Want in a Partner

These women aren’t seeking a trophy partner or someone to match their bank balance. Instead, they value emotional presence, depth of character, and shared intention. They’re looking for partners who can:

* Hold honest conversations
* Appreciate a quiet walk more than a loud party
* Share their love for nature, books, or meaningful travel
* Respect their autonomy while nurturing genuine companionship

They’ve outgrown the games of dating apps and shallow encounters. Whether they’re dating men or women, they prioritize connection and compatibility over flash and flair. A heartfelt dinner with a view of the inlet means far more to them than expensive gifts or name-dropping.

# Where Romance Happens in Bamfield

Unlike major cities where dating often begins in noisy restaurants or crowded bars, romance in Bamfield starts organically—through shared community experiences, quiet walks by the water, or morning coffee at a local café.

You might meet someone while attending a marine research event at the Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre or during a guided kayaking trip. Small local art exhibits, beach clean-ups, or live acoustic music nights at the lodge become meaningful social moments.

What makes dating here feel so intimate is the absence of pressure. There’s no race. No competition. Just people slowly getting to know each other under open skies and ocean breezes.

# Using Dating Apps in a Remote Setting

Though Bamfield is remote, many affluent singles here are tech-savvy and use elite dating platforms like [MillionaireMatch](https://www.millionairematch.com/ca/british-columbia/bamfield/rich-women-dating). These apps are favored for their vetting process and user base of high-net-worth individuals or driven professionals.

Still, women from Bamfield often prefer meaningful conversations over flashy bios. A thoughtful introduction—something that shows attention to their interests or lifestyle—goes a long way. A genuine compliment or shared value around nature, travel, or wellness could spark a real connection.

Don’t expect fast replies or over-the-top selfies. The women here move slowly and intentionally. And they appreciate that in a potential partner.

# How to Attract a Rich Woman in Bamfield

If you’re hoping to date a successful woman in Bamfield, the key is authenticity. Be real, be kind, and be confident without arrogance. You don’t need to impress her with your money, but you should be able to offer emotional stability, respectful communication, and personal direction.

These women are used to making decisions. They don’t need rescuing. But they do appreciate being seen, valued, and supported.

Here are a few characteristics that matter more than wealth:

* A love for nature and quiet living
* Emotional availability
* An interesting life story or passion
* Respect for personal space and independence
* Willingness to build something at a healthy pace

# Challenges and Rewards of Dating in a Remote Place

Dating in a small town like Bamfield does come with its rhythm. Social circles are small, and privacy can be tricky. There may be fewer date options or spontaneous outings, and long-distance arrangements can sometimes form when one partner splits time between Bamfield and a city.

But there’s a powerful upside. Without the distractions of city life, relationships tend to grow more intentionally. You listen. You watch sunsets. You do simple things that mean more—like cooking together, walking the trails, or sharing books and ideas.

It’s not just about falling in love; it’s about staying in love through simplicity.

# Stories from the Shoreline

There are stories of people who came to Bamfield for a retreat or vacation and never left—because they found something (or someone) worth staying for. One couple, both digital nomads, met during a local book club and eventually built a small eco-tourism business together. Another pair bonded over a shared passion for marine conservation and now collaborate on projects that protect the coastline they both love.

These relationships were not built in the fast lane. They grew like the forests here—quietly, steadily, and beautifully.

# A New Kind of Luxury Love

[Rich women dating in Bamfield](https://www.millionairematch.com/ca/british-columbia/bamfield/rich-women-dating) aren’t chasing the traditional trappings of romance. They’ve had the luxury cars, the gala invitations, and the five-star dinners. What they want now is different.

They seek emotional wealth—time, freedom, trust, joy. They’re building lives based on purpose and beauty, and they want someone who shares that vision. If you're ready to step into a love that’s built not on ego but on empathy, Bamfield might be the place where your next chapter begins.

# Conclusion: Romance That Breathes with the Tide

Bamfield isn’t for everyone. But for those who are ready for a slower, deeper, and more meaningful experience of love, it offers a rare and beautiful opportunity. Rich women here are rewriting the dating script. They’re choosing connection over convention. Intention over impulse.

And if you meet them where they are—in stillness, in honesty, in wonder—you just might find a love that feels as natural and breathtaking as the coast itself.

1kgsyjv,https://i.redd.it/uxc7jh7nubze1.jpeg,RegioJet Vienna - Budapest was a stellar experience,"I’d booked my train for this trip a long time ago, originally planning to take the Austrian OBB train. Due to some last minute issues on my end I couldn’t take it, so I looked for alternatives and found a RegioJet train for 12€. 

I’d heard pretty bad things about this company (bad service, delays, old trains etc), so I ended up booking it reluctantly as the last minute tickets for an OBB train was 3-4x the price.

I was expecting a Ryanair type zero-frills experience at best, but it was probably one of the best I’ve had in Europe so far:

1. The value for the price is outstanding. 12€ for a train booked a couple of hours before departure

2. There is a FREE lounge at Vienna Station with coffee, water & comfy seating regardless of ticket class. I can see this being crowded after a point but free is free

3. The train compartment was clean and very modern. It even had small TV screens with movies loaded to watch while you travel. I’ve never seen this in a European train before. Gotta Bring your own headphones with 3.5mm

4. There is even CABIN SERVICE that brings you water/coffee as well as magazines and newspapers if you want it. 

Definitely recommend this train if you’re traveling on the Prague - Vienna - Budapest route.

Morning after morning, she arrived a few minutes late with coffee in hand, a cloth bag on her shoulder, and a lightness in her step that made me straighten in my chair without quite knowing why.

I was never very good at talking to women. Too reserved, too unsure of myself. So I watched her the way one watches a sparrow at a windowsill—gently, cautiously, grateful for even a moment’s attention.

She was already spoken for. A boyfriend in the same office, always dressed like he’d stepped out of a clothing catalogue. They looked good together, in the way couples do when they laugh too easily and share passwords to the office Wi-Fi.

I kept my distance. Admiration, I believed, didn’t have to be noisy. It could exist quietly—like a poem left in a drawer.

Of course, it didn’t remain quiet forever. These things have a way of showing on your face. A few colleagues noticed my eyes following her. They laughed, teased. She noticed too, I think. But she never made it awkward. Neither did he. They were kind—perhaps because they knew nothing would ever come of it.

When the wedding announcement came, it was a Friday. Someone in HR forwarded it to the whole floor—“Join us in celebrating the happy couple!” There was a photo of them under a tree, holding hands. I stared at it for a long time, then quietly marked myself as ‘Not Attending’.

I didn’t go to the office party that week. I walked instead, down the road past the tea stall and the stationery shop, through lanes with crumbling walls and bougainvillea spilling over gates. The sky was clouded, as if in agreement.

In the days that followed, the jokes returned, sharper this time.

“Bechara,” one colleague said. “White kurta kab pehnega?”

“Arrey, he’ll bring the dhol to her bidaai,” said another.

I smiled. That’s all you can do, really. Smile and wait for people to get bored.

After the wedding, she came to me at the water cooler. “All okay?” she asked, like one might ask the weather.

“Of course,” I said. “Nothing new.”

She smiled and walked away. I never spoke to her again.

Now, when I feel the first tugs of another foolish affection, I hum an old tune under my breath—*Aye dil sambhal ja zara…* It helps. A little.

People think the heart is this grand, dramatic organ. But it’s really just a stubborn little thing, misbehaving when no one’s watching.

She still sits by the window, though she’s changed desks since. I no longer look her way. Not out of anger. Just practice.

Some women leave behind perfumes, hairpins, letters. She left behind a season of my life. One I don’t revisit too often—but when I do, I do so gently.

After all, what’s the point of a crush, if not to remind us that we’re still capable of wonder?

1kgsr8y,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1kgsr8y/galactic_emergency_protocol_code_17/,Galactic Emergency Protocol Code 17,"I sat in my seat on the bridge of the Ambassadorial flagship, our escort to our flanks as we watched the exercise unfold. We were newcomers to the galactic hierarchy, barely a standard year had passed since we had been allowed to join. This was little more than the standard bi-annual fire exercise, a simple sparring match that will allow engineers, scientists and officers chances to test tactics and gather data to improve systems. This was all expected, done often enough by our own empire. We did, however, politely ask for an observer's position in the exercise so we could gather our own data. A request that was politely accepted.



Ships within this 'Confederacy' were wide and varied, reflective of the diversity of thought and race within the collective. Smooth hulls and curved shapes from the more elegant empires, rounded hulls from more insectoid or hive minded empires, and straight hulls with right angles for those with more practical patterns. From simple single person craft to enormous hulks called 'carriers', which was an entirely new concept to us. A large capital class warship whose entire armament was fighter and bomber craft. Clearly a novel and obviously brilliant concept considering how these 'carriers' were causing a stalemate.



The empires had put 'dummy' targets around the battle area, ships with no crew and limited automation scripting to make them float about the area. Some two or three dozen of these dummy ships were wandering about, firing training lasers or hollow railgun slugs at low speeds at any target they can find. A sophisticated AI system calculating damage proportions and numbers. Every time a ship took too much damage, its hull would light up with a pattern of blue lights, then it would disengage to a standby phase somewhere away from the fight.



A litany of strategies and tactics played out before us. A few of which we ourselves used in combat. We did however have an advantage of some kind at least. The main Beam Cannon arrays on our ships could hit further than any other sip here, so our warships would be an impressively potent force to be reckoned with. We had the advantage of range and firepower. If they played right and we had a fair deal when it came to trade relations, we would be nigh unstoppable. That was the hope anyway.



""How goes the fight ensign?"" I asked.



""Apparently Blue Team is winning, sir, seventeen of the thirty five drone targets have been knocked out."" He replied.



""Well that's good then. Are we recording this as per protocol?"" I said, as one of the drone targets powered down and began to drift in the void.



""Yes sir. Our strategists will be pouring over this data for months. I dare say they will be most enthused."" He replied and adjusted some knobs on his console.



I watched the battle unfold. My eyes caught a group of three warships, a frigate and two destroyers, gracefully charging in behind one of the target drones in a line formation, engines at full speed. The formation moved forward and engaged, with a truly impressive level of coordination as they charged through the void towards a dreadnought sized dummy target. And then suddenly, it all came to a blaring, screeching halt.



""What in the devil's tits is going on!?"" I yelled as the whole battle just stopped as if a god snapped his fingers.



""CODE SEVENTEEN!! CODE SEVENTEEN!!!"" Came the panicked and terrified scream of one of the Eristani ships.



Then there, in the background, one of the ships had bright, flashing red lights lit up all across its entire hull structure. The battle halted mid stride and a cacophony of panicked screaming suddenly erupted from every communication channel possible. We went to high alert based solely on the panic in others, charging weapons and shields. The panic was this severe then it meant we were about to face an existential threat.



Moments later, a new ship appeared in the star system. ""My Lord! New vessel detected, Dreadnought class!""



""Prepare battle formation!"" I ordered.



Pilots moved our ships to a star formation and readied our main cannon to fire. But by the time we were ready to engage it, it was already right on top of us. ""How in the hell is that thing so fast!?"" I yelled as it approached us then blew right past us.



The thing was massive, a dreadnought after all, bristling with dozens of cannons and missile bays. It was more heavily armed than any other warship present. Its armour plating and shield systems outclassed anything around us and it moved with the kind of speed that no ship that size should ever be allowed to travel. Jagged edges, triangular shape and strange markings. It blew past us, the size and velocity causing the artificial gravity generator aboard our ship to malfunction and throwing various supplies around the floor. By the time we had turned our cannons towards it we were receiving hastily gasped orders to stand down our weapons and the massive ship had boarded the ship with the bright flashing lights.



""Quick! We have access to internal security on their ships for the exercise! See if you can find which ship it is and patch us in!"" I commanded.



""I am already on it My Lord! Sending requests... I'm in!"" My ensign replied.



The monitors and displays we had switched over to feeds from inside the stricken ship. One such feed was a helmet mounted camera. The camera showed them frantically charging through the ship's corridors, past the panic stricken crew members who were frantically pointing them in the direction of the 'threat'. That 'threat' turned out to be some kind of odd device. In the mess hall. The soldier wearing the camera approached it with extreme caution and produced some kind of scanning tool and waved it at the strange device. The device itself looked like a cheaply made plastic and glass water filter of some description.



""What... The actual hell is going on? What is that thing?"" I asked.



""I have no identity details, My Lord. The only thing I can get from the mainframe regarding the device is that its a... 'Fred'. That's it. 'Fred.'"" My ensign replied.



""It's... A Fred? What the hell is a Fred?"" I asked again, genuinely confused.



""I shall try to cross reference... Uh... One moment. Hm... I have no ident details on what exactly they are. I have no straight answers ser. I keep getting words like 'Susan', 'James', 'Jamal', 'Julius' and.... Erm... 'Silly Edmund'.... For some reason. I have no idea what's going on."" He replied.



""I shall call the Ambassador and ask."" I said and hailed the flagship.



I waited, watching the scene unfold. My call to the ambassador was received but put on hold. We watched as the emergency procedure played out. Faster than anyone could even imagine let alone see, the officer worked, quickly replacing components, fixing wires and working on parts. He filled the receptacle on the back with fresh water, then filled the top part with some kind of dark powdery substance. He then pressed a button and the device powered up, then started making very odd sounds. Finally the officer leaned in, took a deep breath and sniffed the odour coming from the odd black liquid that came out of it. He pressed the alarm button on the side and the alert ended. Then just like that, the fleet resumed its operations.



I sat jaw open, bewildered, befuddled and unable to process what the hell just happened as the fleet instantly returned to normal operations, and the officer with the helmet cam hid behind a doorway to watch the result. A creature identified as a 'human' with the rank of 'service technician' appeared and stood by the device, groggily, almost sleepily, stood near it and waited for the device to finish its filtering cycle. He put some of the odd black liquid into a cup of some kind, then began drinking it, casually walking away as if there wasn't a serious emergency just now. The soldier raised a hand, gave what we identified as a 'thumbs up' signal then quickly returned to his ship. That very ship rapidly disappeared from the star system and just like that, the mock battle resumed.



The Ambassador finally responded to my call, and acted as if nothing happened. ""Yes Master Loris? You had a request?""



I sat there with my jaw open. Wordlessly, I frantically pointed at the screen, then at the ship that had just caused the entire battle to stop mid-fight. ""...WHAT...""



""Oh! Sorry I forgot to tell you. Galactic Emergency Protocol Code Seventeen. Emergency Coffee Machine Repair Services. The 'Human Caffeine Protocol' I forgot to explain it to you."" He simply replied with a genuine smile.



""Wh... Emergency Coffee WHAT!?"" I bellowed.



""Look, you are still new so you don't have to face this problem, so I don't expect you to understand. It's... Something we have gotten used to. It's something we make concessions for. And we never regretted that decision. Don't worry about it."" He replied with a gentle smile.



""Can you please try to explain it then?"" I asked.



""Very well."" He glared into the camera lens, getting uncomfortably close to it. He spoke close to the audio device and spoke deep and slow. ""Humans... are FREAKS OF NATURE.""



I leaned back in my seat, scared. ""O...Kay...""



He returned to normal posture. ""Humans are a species that hails from a Class 14 Deathworld. Most of these humans, especially the adults, seem to function on a substance called coffee. Which is highly toxic to most species in the galaxy. Probably you as well. They however almost require it to function properly, especially after a sleep cycle."" He said.



""I... see... So you have what... at least what looks like an entire military grade contingent force to keep these 'coffee' things working?"" I replied, still confused.



""It goes a bit deeper than that. You know how I said humans are freaks of nature? Well they are. They also possess some kind of magical or psychic abilities. Especially the Engineers."" he said.



I scoffed immediately. ""Preposterous! Magic and psychics aren't real. Believe me we have tried so many times to figure that out."" I said, leaning back in my seat.



""And I say you are wrong. At least when it comes to humans. They are... Abnormal. To say the least. But the benefits of their presence outweigh ANY kind of cost associated with it. When it comes to janitorial or cleanliness services, you get a specific kind of human, your ship will be FACTORY PRISTINE for the entire duration of his stay. You get a pilot? Human pilots seem to have an entire sixth sense dedicated to the task, and they can navigate asteroid fields that none of us would ever dare go near. Some of the simplest tasks... You get the right kind of human... In charge of the correct system... You are almost invulnerable."" He replied.



""I... I see... So...""



""In short, I have a human aboard my flagship too. Jeffrey. He's the mechanic specialist in charge of my ship's reactor. It has been twenty years, galactic standard, since he showed up. Despite the fact my reactor is Fifteen cycles out of date - it outperforms the latest model by fifteen percent."" He said.



I raised my eyebrow at the statement. ""Erm... Well that's...""



""Here's the proof."" He said, and sent us details on the reactor core systems on that ship. Certain fields were classified of course but we could clearly see the difference. It was messy but... It was real.



""Oh my..."" My engineer said as he looked it over as well. I could see him salivating at the sight.



""So... That's... new. Are these humans common? How do they do it?"" I asked.



""We have no idea. Jury-rigging, parts replacements, logic? Magic? We have no idea. The pilots seem to instinctively know what path to take and where to go when flying through hazardous locations. Engineers seem to be able to source replacement parts and engine thruster upgrades from thin air or scrap parts in the garbage can. Child care and home care workers seem to have this natural charisma about them that makes younglings just... adore them. Accountants seem to be able to pull numbers out of their rear ends, and all those numbers are always legitimate. Lawyers can argue in defence of a rock that fell on someone... And make sure the rock wins."" He said, showing various pictures of humans doing what he described, showing articles, news feeds and security footage.



""Okay I think I get the idea. But what's with the Protocol Seventeen business? How do you justify what is clearly a dedicated military armed force to the process of repairing a beverage machine?"" I asked.



""When humans are deprived of coffee... BAD things happen. like that one time on Cerros Four, that dude Marcus... He ran out of coffee. He went completely insane. He took out SEVEN Daktarian Praetorians… with his bare hands."" He replied.



What followed was a short clip of a normal, ordinary, meaty human with no natural armaments or anything like that, beating the absolute shite out of seven, heavily armed, heavily clawed soldiers of a crustacean-like species. Throwing them over his shoulder like toys, slamming them into walls and cracking chitin shells with his bare fists in a blind rage.



""And then there was that guy Frank from New Calaban who had a nervous breakdown because his coffee machine broke down."" He said, again showing me more footage.



It was a montage of this human very quickly escalating from mild disappointment, to psychotic insanity. Starting with him standing in front of the coffee machine and looking very sad that it wasn't working, to him chewing on dry coffee granules, to him chugging an entire can of granules mixed with cold water, to finally ending with him scribbling incoherent coffee related ramblings on the canteen walls as he tears the place apart looking for replacement components.



""We have no idea what the real relationship between these humans and these machines really is. We have tried to run experiments on it but... We find no real correlation. It varies from human to human, which makes it worse. Some humans even prefer a beverage called 'tea' above coffee, but it doesn't change the result if something goes wrong. If a teapot breaks, the human who owns it will go psychotically insane. Especially if that teapot is a family heirloom of some kind. Is it the noise the machine makes? Is there some kind of subliminal calmness message? Is it the caffeine in the coffee or tea? Is it the flavour or texture? Is it the simple act of drinking or ceremony involved that makes their brains work? We don't know. And we never will."" He said.



The monitor displayed a legion of small short videos showing humans accomplishing nearly impossible tasks, insane stunts, incredible moves or pulling parts and repairs seemingly from the void, all just after having a cup of coffee.



""To be honest, we don't really care. it is in fact worth the cost. The billions of credits we save on repairs, fleet maintenance and operations costs from their activities, we can afford not only tax breaks for citizenry, but also afford to operate these emergency services. These freaks of nature only require the ritual of coffee or tea to do everything they do. Stuff that has saved our asses more times than we can count in over two hundred years of them being around. Frankly, the price we pay is cheap."" He said with a smirk.



I nodded along, my Ensign bringing up various articles, documentation and evidence as he explained everything. Indeed it was looking as though the exchange was... More than profitable.



""I see... All this skill and resource... And all we have to do is let them make coffee?"" I asked.



""Pretty much."" He replied with a shrug.



""I shall have to speak with the Emperor and run some... Experiments. But this evidence looks solid. Where do I get one?"" I asked.



""Go to any station and offer a job listing. Humans outnumber most galactic species twenty to one, so finding a human outside of Terran space looking for a job is as easy as finding dirt."" He replied.



""Twenty to one!?"" I yelled. ""Seriously?""



""You will get used to it eventually. Humans mostly keep to their own space. Mostly. But there's always a guy somewhere, usually in a bar, looking for work. Just make sure you have a coffee machine installed and spare parts for it available. As well as a sufficient stock of coffee. You either have a psycho who will kill your crew in his sleep, or you will have a ships engineer who can do the impossible, provided he has the coffee supply he needs. Just be careful."" He said with a stern look.



""I will make note of that. Oh by the way... does this Code Seventeen thing have its own insurance plan?"" I asked.



""I have already sent you the documents, I knew you would ask."" He replied with a  sly grin.



Months after this, we had a human service technician on board. And a strange rattle that had been plaguing our ships for decades was suddenly gone.

I did it this spring (2025), and I can honestly say it's one of the most relaxing, breathtaking, and authentic trips I've ever taken. Paxos remains a hidden gem in the Ionian Sea, and thanks to a recent push for sustainable tourism, it’s quieter, cleaner, and more welcoming than ever.

Here’s how my week unfolded—filled with coastal hikes, beach swims, and late dinners under the stars. I rented a scooter for the week, stayed in a villa near Glyfada Beach, and let Paxos work its quiet magic on me.

**Day 1: Arrival & Sunset by the Sea**

After a smooth ferry ride from Corfu, I arrived in Gaios and picked up my rental scooter. The ride to **Paxos Glyfada Beach Villas** took less than 15 minutes—and wow, what a peaceful setting. My villa overlooked the sea, with nothing but olive groves behind me and the sound of cicadas in the air.

https://preview.redd.it/hrh0pp0j5bze1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cf44495688e1b257ceda0fc0105c6de9b8a82010

I grabbed an early dinner at the on-site beach taverna—fresh grilled octopus and a crisp glass of white wine—and then wandered down to the shore for my first sunset. The colors melted over the water in shades of peach and lavender. No filters needed.

**Day 2: Lakka – Hidden Bays & Horizon Views**

I headed north to **Lakka**, the prettiest little harbor village you can imagine. The weather in May 2025 has been ideal—sunny, warm, but not scorching, with a light breeze.

https://preview.redd.it/q7ukrodp5bze1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5658c7f73d80252aad8eb06881443c0677bef9db

After exploring the narrow streets and grabbing a freddo espresso, I swam at **Harami Beach**—super calm, perfect for floating. Later, I took the short uphill hike to the **Lakka Lighthouse**, then wandered down the rocky path to **Plani Beach**, where you can see **Corfu** clear as day in the distance.

Dinner? Seafront at **Arriva Taverna**, with the sound of boats gently clinking in the harbor.

**Day 3: A Day on Antipaxos**

This was the highlight of the week. I booked a small-group boat cruise (Panos Boats & Trips—they're still amazing), and we set sail from **Gaios**. We circled Paxos first, stopping at the **Blue Caves**, which are still as surreal as ever—especially with this year’s clear water conditions.

https://preview.redd.it/mpbwp9er5bze1.jpg?width=1023&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=abb594b24eb12cd10ba2a8956e32ce2d905d43f7

**Antipaxos** stole the show, though. [Voutoumi Beach](https://www.paxosglyfada.com/voutoumi-beach-paxis-slice-of-paradise/) looked like something from the Caribbean—white sand, turquoise water, and hardly anyone around. Lunch at a beach taverna included fresh-caught sea bream and a glass of locally made wine (yes, they still make their own on the island). I didn’t want to leave.

**Day 4: A Coastal Walk to Loggos**

I took a break from the scooter and walked to **Loggos** from my villa—an easy and scenic hour along the coast. The path winds through olive groves and offers sea views the whole way.

https://preview.redd.it/tmrwfiwt5bze1.jpg?width=962&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fc85544f11e184a16b04cdcb767d1bb2d13bd582

In town, I had a spinach pie and iced coffee from **Martha’s Bakery**, then wandered around the harbor. There’s a tiny 18th-century church worth stepping into—**Agios Nikolaos**, with lovely old icons and candlelight. After lunch, I rented a paddleboard and cruised along the coast, soaking up the sunshine and quiet.

**Day 5: Erimitis Cliffs & Sunset Cocktails**

This day started at **Erimitis**, where the cliffs drop dramatically into the sea. I arrived mid-morning, and the view was absolutely epic. The recent weather has made the air unusually clear—on a good day, you can see as far as the edge of Italy.

The beach below is a bit of a hike, but totally worth it—still wild, still beautiful.

Later, I made my way to **Averto Day & Night**, a bar in **Magazia** that’s become one of the coolest hangouts on the island. I watched the sun dip behind the cliffs while sipping on a local gin cocktail. This spot alone is worth coming to Paxos for.

**Day 6:** [Gaios at Leisure & a Dip at Mongonissi](https://www.paxosglyfada.com/mongonis-paxos-greece-activities-attractions-and-travel-tips/)

I’d only seen **Gaios** in passing, so I gave it a full day. I wandered the harborfront, explored the little shops for handmade ceramics and olive wood souvenirs, and found a charming café tucked into an alleyway where I lost an hour sipping coffee and people-watching.

https://preview.redd.it/q6o3e1mw5bze1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=39f8eb4ac90f348eaec37dce70ba00bed893703b

In the afternoon, I zipped down to **Mongonissi Beach**, which is perfect if you like gentle, shallow water. There’s a laid-back beach bar where I had a final lunch of souvlaki and tzatziki under the trees.

**Day 7: One Last Look**

I took my time packing on my last morning, sitting on my villa’s terrace with a strong Greek coffee and the sound of waves below. My ferry was just after lunch, so I squeezed in one last dip in the sea and let the sunshine do its thing.

Leaving Paxos felt like waking from a beautiful dream—but I promised myself I’d return. Maybe next year, maybe in five. But once Paxos finds you, it stays with you.

**Tips for 2025 Travelers:**

* **Book early**: Villas and boat tours are in higher demand this year due to increased interest in quieter travel.
* **Bring hiking shoes**: The walking paths are worth it.
* **Travel light**: You won’t need much more than swimwear, sandals, and something to wear to dinner.

It was always Sunday when it hit me.
Not with noise or chaos, but with a kind of *quiet* I couldn’t shake off. Like the world was too still. Too silent.
Too full of things I never said.

I used to love Sundays.
Warm coffee. Socks too big. A notebook in my lap and music humming low from another room. My family’s voices blending with the sound of birds through the open window.
*Safe. Simple. Soft.*

But that was before the *disconnect*.
Before people stopped hearing the things I wasn’t saying.

But loneliness doesn’t need space. It lives in *between* the words. In the second you laugh a little too loudly so no one asks if you’re okay. In the glance someone gives you that feels like love but turns out to be *obligation*.

I kept showing up, smiling, talking about the weather, nodding at the right moments.
Everyone said I seemed fine.

*And I was.*
Until I wasn’t.

It wasn’t big.
No dramatic event. No explosion.
Just... a soft unraveling. Like thread pulling from a sweater you didn’t know had a hole.

I stopped answering texts.
Stopped looking in mirrors.
Stopped feeling like a *person*.

And yet, I kept going.
Because that’s what people do, right?

They wake up.
They fake the light.
They tell themselves maybe tomorrow, maybe next week, maybe—just maybe—it’ll get better.

But the glass was already halfway full of things I hadn’t poured out.

Let me tell you about the real unsung heroes of the Army: the documents. Specifically, the ones that land on my desk.
It was a Tuesday. Or maybe a Wednesday. Honestly, they all bleed together after a while. My desk, affectionately known as ""Mount Paperwork,"" was particularly active that day. I was locked in a fierce battle with a stack of FLIPLs, each one a thrilling saga of lost night vision devices and mysteriously broken coffee makers. My weapon of choice? A family-sized bag of Fuego Takis and the unwavering belief that at least some of these investigations would eventually close.
Then it arrived. A folder, unremarkable in every way except for the faint scent of desperation clinging to it. ""CSP Request"" was scrawled across the front in what looked like the handwriting of someone who hadn't slept properly since basic training. I sighed. Another one for the pile.
I grabbed a handful of Takis, the fiery dust coating my fingers like a badge of honor. As I leaned back, contemplating the existential dread of another hour spent deciphering acronyms, something clinked.
""Huh,"" I muttered, fishing around in the envelope. My fingers brushed against something hard and smooth. I pulled it out. It was one of those little white Apple doohickeys. An AirTag, I think they're called.
My first thought? ""Sweet! Free tech!"" My second thought, after a brief internal debate with my conscience (which usually loses to my stomach), was, ""How did this get in here?""
I shook the envelope. Nothing else. Just the CSP paperwork and this tiny tracking device.
Now, my job isn't exactly James Bond material. The most clandestine thing I usually deal with is trying to figure out if that blurry signature on a leave form is a legitimate ""X"" or just someone having a bad day. But a tracking device? That was new.
My imagination, fueled by Takis and caffeine, immediately went into overdrive. Was this some kind of secret agent stuff? Was this lieutenant involved in something way above my pay grade? Was this AirTag going to self-destruct in ten seconds? (Spoiler alert: it didn't.)
I spent a good ten minutes waving the AirTag around, trying to look important while simultaneously Googling ""what is an airtag."" Turns out, it's basically a fancy lost-and-found tag.
Lost? This packet just got here! Unless… unless this poor lieutenant was so traumatized by the Army's document-eating black holes that he preemptively tagged his CSP request like it was a migrating endangered species.
The thought made me snort, scattering spicy Takis dust across the already questionable surface of my desk.
I pictured him, hunched over in some dimly lit office, carefully taping this thing inside the folder like it was a priceless artifact. I imagined the sheer relief he must have felt, thinking he'd outsmarted the system.
And here it was, on my desk, next to a half-eaten bag of Takis and a coffee stain that vaguely resembled the state of Texas.
I almost felt bad for him. Almost. The paperwork still needed processing.
So, I did what any overworked, slightly unhinged paralegal would do. I tossed the AirTag into my ""random stuff"" drawer (which also contained a rubber chicken, three mismatched socks, and a fortune cookie that promised ""untold riches"" but only contained a blank slip of paper).
Then, I grabbed another handful of Takis and started reviewing the CSP request. Honestly, it looked pretty straightforward. Didn't seem like it needed the level of technological safeguarding usually reserved for nuclear launch codes.
A few days later, I heard through the grapevine about some lieutenant getting chewed out by his XO for putting a tracker on his packet. Apparently, the XO wasn't thrilled about the perceived lack of trust.
I just smiled to myself, munching on a Taki. Trust the system? Bless his heart. The system is held together by caffeine, desperation, and the faint hope that the shredder doesn't jam today.
So, Lieutenant Whoever-You-Are, maybe just offer your S1 a bag of Takis. It works wonders. Trust me. I'm practically a subject matter expert.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The ideal dad hat boasts a combination of comfort, durability, and aesthetic appeal. Key features to consider include the material, fit, design, and adjustability.

**Material:** The fabric used in a dad hat significantly impacts its comfort and durability.

Cotton is a popular choice for its breathability and softness, making it ideal for everyday wear. Look for high-quality cotton twill for enhanced durability. Polyester blends offer increased water resistance and wrinkle resistance, making them suitable for outdoor activities. Some premium dad hats incorporate materials like linen or wool for a more refined look and feel. The material should feel comfortable against the skin and withstand regular use without fading or losing its shape.

**Fit & Shape:** The classic dad hat shape features a slightly curved brim and a relaxed, unstructured crown.

This design provides a comfortable, low-profile fit that contours to the head without being too tight. The crown height should be moderate, allowing for ample headroom without appearing bulky. Pay attention to the overall shape of the hat, ensuring it complements your facial features. Some variations include slightly higher crowns or more pronounced curves in the brim, so consider your personal preferences.

**Adjustability:** A well-designed adjustable closure is crucial for achieving a comfortable and secure fit.

Most dad hats feature a buckle strap, slide closure, or velcro strap at the back. Buckle straps offer the most precise adjustment and a clean, classic look. Slide closures are easy to use and provide a secure hold. Velcro straps are convenient for quick adjustments, but may wear out over time. The adjustment mechanism should be durable and easy to operate, ensuring a snug and comfortable fit for a range of head sizes.

**Design & Style:** Dad hats come in a wide range of designs, from minimalist solids to bold patterns and embroidered logos.

Consider your personal style and the types of outfits you'll be wearing the hat with. Solid-colored hats offer versatility and can be easily paired with various outfits. Embroidered logos or graphics add a touch of personality and can reflect your interests or affiliations. Patterns like stripes, plaids, or camo can make a bolder statement. Look for high-quality embroidery or printing that will withstand washing and wear.

**Ventilation:** Adequate ventilation is essential for keeping your head cool and comfortable, especially in warm weather.

Some dad hats feature embroidered eyelets or mesh panels to promote airflow. Eyelets are small holes sewn into the crown of the hat that allow air to circulate. Mesh panels provide even greater ventilation, making them ideal for activities that generate heat. Consider the climate you'll be wearing the hat in and choose a style with appropriate ventilation features.

**Brim Construction:** The brim of a dad hat provides shade and protection from the sun.

The brim should be firm enough to hold its shape but flexible enough to be comfortable. Check for consistent stitching and a well-defined curve. Some brims are pre-curved, while others allow you to customize the curvature to your liking. The brim length should be proportional to the hat's overall size and provide adequate coverage for your face.

 ## Core Benefits

Dad hats offer several key benefits that make them a popular choice for guys. These include comfort, versatility, style, and sun protection.

**Comfort & Fit:** The unstructured design and adjustable closure of dad hats provide a comfortable and personalized fit. The soft materials used in their construction ensure that they feel good against the skin, even after extended wear. This combination of features makes dad hats ideal for everyday use, whether you're running errands, relaxing at home, or engaging in outdoor activities.

**Versatile Style:** Dad hats seamlessly blend with a wide range of outfits and styles. They can be dressed up or down, making them a versatile addition to any wardrobe. Pair a solid-colored dad hat with jeans and a t-shirt for a casual look, or wear it with chinos and a button-down shirt for a more polished ensemble. Their adaptability makes them suitable for various occasions.

**Sun Protection:** The curved brim of a dad hat provides effective shade and protection from the sun's harmful UV rays. This is especially important for outdoor activities like hiking, golfing, or simply spending time in the park. Wearing a dad hat can help prevent sunburn, reduce the risk of skin damage, and keep you comfortable in sunny conditions.

**Expressing Individuality:** With a vast array of designs, colors, and logos available, dad hats offer a unique opportunity to express your personal style and interests. Choose a hat that reflects your favorite sports team, hobby, or brand. Embroidered designs, bold colors, and unique patterns can all help you stand out from the crowd and make a statement.

**Affordable Fashion:** Dad hats are generally affordable, making them an accessible way to update your wardrobe and stay on trend without breaking the bank. You can easily acquire several different styles to match various outfits and occasions. Their affordability makes them a low-risk fashion investment.

 ## FAQs Section

**What is the best way to clean a dad hat?**
   Hand washing is generally the best method for cleaning dad hats to prevent damage or shrinkage. Use a mild detergent and lukewarm water. Gently scrub the hat with a soft cloth, paying attention to any stains or soiled areas. Rinse thoroughly with clean water and allow the hat to air dry in a well-ventilated area. Avoid using a washing machine or dryer, as this can distort the shape of the hat.

**How do I choose the right size dad hat?**
   Most dad hats are adjustable and designed to fit a wide range of head sizes. However, it's still important to consider the fit and adjustability features. Look for hats with a buckle strap or slide closure that allows for precise adjustments. Measure your head circumference if possible, and compare it to the hat's size range. Make sure the hat feels comfortable and secure without being too tight.

**Can I wear a dad hat with formal attire?**
   While dad hats are primarily designed for casual wear, they can be incorporated into semi-formal outfits in certain contexts. Consider pairing a minimalist, solid-colored dad hat with a blazer and chinos for a relaxed yet stylish look. However, avoid wearing dad hats with highly formal attire such as suits or tuxedos. The key is to strike a balance between casual and sophisticated.

**What are the trending dad hat styles for 2025?**
   In 2025, trending dad hat styles include minimalist designs, earth tones, and vintage-inspired logos. Hats made from sustainable materials are also gaining popularity. Look for muted colors like olive green, navy blue, and beige. Embroidered designs with a retro feel are also on trend. Performance-driven materials like moisture-wicking fabrics are becoming more common for active wear.

Until I Discovered This 10-Minute Reframe: Now I Actually *Enjoy* the Grind 🚀","**Stuck in Hyperdrive? I Used to Think ""Just Push Harder"" Was the Answer... Until I Discovered This 10-Minute Reframe: Now I Actually *Enjoy* the Grind 🚀**

Ever had one of those days where you're just *going and going*, but you feel like you're stuck on a hamster wheel? 🐹 Yep, me too. For the longest time, I believed that the key to success was to just grind it out harder than everyone else. I’d push through fatigue, ignore my needs, and just keep hustling. Sound familiar?

But here’s the thing: after a series of burnout episodes that left me questioning my life's choices (and maybe eating too many ice cream tubs), I stumbled upon a magical little 10-minute reframe that changed everything for me. 🎉 

Here’s the scoop:

1. **The Power of Perspective**  
   Instead of saying ""I have to work harder,"" I switched it to ""I get to work smarter."" It's wild how two little words can flip the script!  
   - Suddenly, it wasn't about exhausting myself for the sake of effort.
   - It became about leveraging my strengths and being intentional with my time.

2. **Find Joy in the Process**  
   Remember that time you dove into a project you were super passionate about? It didn’t feel like work, did it?  
   - I realized that if I could sprinkle a little joy into the mundane grind, everything changed. 
   - I started *celebrating small wins*, like finishing a tough task or even just getting a good cup of coffee. ☕️

3. **Schedule ‘Me Time’**  
   Wait, what? Isn’t that counterproductive? 🤔 Nope! Taking breaks to recharge makes me more efficient.  
   - I carved out 10 minutes to do something I love—whether it’s doodling, meditating, or petting my cat.
   - These breaks became little pockets of joy that revive my motivation. 

4. **Visualize Your Goals**  
   Instead of just grinding through tasks, I started picturing where I wanted to be.  
   - It was a game-changer! When I can visualize the end goal, suddenly those late-night working sessions become stepping stones rather than cliffs to climb. 🌄 

5. **Surround Yourself with Positivity**  
   I realized the company I keep matters.  
   - Engaging with like-minded, driven people in the MaximizeMe community has been a breath of fresh air!
   - We cheer each other on and celebrate progress, making the grind feel a lot less grueling.

Now, does this mean I never feel stressed again? Heck, no! 💁‍♂️ But with this reframe, I've discovered that grind doesn’t have to feel like a never-ending battle. It can actually be *enjoyable*! 

So, the next time you find yourself in hyperdrive, remember: it’s not just about pushing harder. Sometimes, it’s about taking a step back, laughing a little, and maybe even doing a happy dance in your kitchen. 💃 

What about you? How do you make the grind more enjoyable? Let’s keep this conversation going!",1,1746608140.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

1kgsleg,https://www.reddit.com/r/BeyondTheBumpUK/comments/1kgsleg/struggling_with_a_needy_baby/,Struggling with a needy baby,"My 3 month old baby wakes up happy and smiley and interested in her surroundings and not immediately velcro. 
Within half an hour she's velcro and angry. She even cries immediately if put on her playmat before she realises that it's actually fun. But just the process of leaning to put her down causes a screaming match. I've been trying to put her down for first nap of the day for a while, it's often 10 minutes of crying and then she'll fall asleep.  Theres no chance of her going down for another nap. I carried her in the baby carrier for nearly 10 hours yesterday, and I got 20 minutes of her playing on the playmat while I managed to do a couple of things that wouldn't be possible when carrying her. And then it was back to screaming until she was back in the carrier. 

She also gets very angry and screamy every time she starts to feel tired (not overtired, just starting to feel tired, like 40 minutes after waking). 

It often feels like stopping at all is not okay for her, eg she'll scream if I go to the toilet even if I'm carrying her. 

I just don't understand the disconnect between her first half hour of the day and the rest of the day, it's like she's 2 different babies. 

First half hour she gives me so many smiles and we lay on the bed chatting, and she watches me get dressed and get her stuff together. We have a cuddle, feed, we go downstairs and I have her in her swing with music while I wash her bottles and makes coffee, and chat her the whole time. She's happy and content. Sometimes she'll stay in the swing, sometimes she wants out and we do something else, but every time without fail she'll start to then really kick off and I can't stop it without have her attached to me, and even then it doesn't always stop it. 

I feel like I'm missing something because she's always spending the first bit of the day happy and content and then it all changes. 

She's always day napped in the carrier, before we got it she just stayed awake and screamed for hours until she would pass out, so it was a godsend to actually manage to get her to sleep during the day. 

Her wake windows are like clockwork in terms of when she gets tired, but she really really has to be helped to go to sleep.

I suspect the entire problem is fighting sleep and getting overtired? Because she's happy for a bit after a night's sleep? 

I'm just getting really down about it. She wasn't a cuddly newborn, she screamed and screamed and screamed, then she got better for a few weeks, but still very needy, now she just seems to have gone backwards. Her smiles are the only thing keeping me going, but a lot of the tim I'm time I'm really struggling with what my life is at the moment.

Edit to add: she's happier and more relaxed when out and about, but I can't be out and about all day every day. We were out for 4 hours yesterday in the carrier, she was chill and asleep for half the time, happy for 20 minutes on the mat when we got home, and then kicking off again. When we were out and afterwards her wake windows massively shortened to 20-45 minutes. I don't have a village, my only opportunity for breaks is when my husband isn't working.

1kgslb5,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThailandTourism/comments/1kgslb5/my_very_first_trip_to_thailand/,My very first trip to Thailand,"Hey,

just wanted to share my impressions from my recent three and a half weeks Singapore-Thailand holiday.

I made a round trip with my cousin and my aunt. We visited Singapore, then we went to Chiang Mai, then Bangkok and after this we went to Koh Chang island.

Sure, we were mainly in tourist areas, national parks and so on. I visited a lot different countries but the kindness here … in every place I were … never experienced that to that extent in another holiday.

And I love Thai food now :). In each restaurant or each street foot location it was simply tasty. Not a single time bad, always a bit better or slightly worse. I love it! even the street foot was great, I was sceptical at the beginning because I am not used to it.

The architecture in Chiang Mai is quite ugly to be honest and we found limited beautiful buildings, aside the temples of course, the same in old town but despite that I felt good when spending time in the city after we visited national parks in the mountains. After the vistit of Singapore it was a big contrast.

Bangkok provided a different feel. We preferred Chiang Mai but were probably in the main tourist area in Bangkok, Sukhumvit 11. It felt more visting Thailand in Chiang Mai. In Bangkok the skyscraper architecture is very impressive though. At that time we experienced the Songkran event. Well, after breakfast we were wet the whole day despite not taking actively part in the event but it definately was fun anyway, despite were were sitting wet in the restaurant the three days. Nice event. But the amount of prostitutes in that area was shocking, seeing all these young woman ...

Koh Chang is a very beautiful and calm island we enjoyed alot. Hilly island, small mountains, the whole island jungle, a bunch of small islands in the South where we made a boat trip. We enjoyed several jungle trails and the White Sands Beach. A lovely beach with nice beach restaurants and bars, long enough for nice beach walks.

Well, I am male and when Thai woman smiled at me, with their soft and calm voices, combined with the friendliness … great feel. That had consequences ...

On our way to Koh Chang, in the middle of nowhere, I wanted to buy a hot black tea, but the lady’s hardly understood English in the coffee shop. All ladies immediately tried their best to understand what I wanted, concentrated on me, in order to not make a mistake and all were laughing, combined with the above … I would have married each of them lol.

My sensitivity resulted into an issue though.

When we were in Chiang Mai we visited a bar for a few beer. Most bars were surprisingly quite empty and we choose one where some people were sitting. It was so hot, we made a city walk and had great street food before … time for a refreshing beer, not recognizing that we went into a lady bar. Before we didnt have a clue that such thing exists.

We were sitting outside at the street waiting for the beer. A young lady came … ouh, such a beauty … . She hardly could speak English but the combination of few English words with a pile of Thai words was quite cute though. But no clue what she was saying lol.

Then she asked for a drink and of course we ordered one for here. Then other girls were coming over time, everyone laughing, it was funny, … more drinks … we got drunk ... then they started to play with our balls … finally we had 83 cocktails on our bill … so friendly lol.

It was a very nice holiday and Thailand is a very beautiful country. I will remember the trip for a long time.",0,1746607841.0,ThailandTourism,2,0.5,False

1kgshyd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1kgshyd/would_you_let_your_partner_go_through_your_phone/,Would you let your partner go through your phone? My girlfriend just dumped me over this,"Lesbian couple here (I’m 35, she’s 37). We were almost at our one-year mark when shit hit the fan yesterday. She noticed I changed my phone passcode and immediately called it quits. Here’s the thing: when we started dating, we had those intense “radical honesty” talks where we promised total transparency – including swapping phone passwords. 

But over the past few months, it started feeling like I was under surveillance. She’d scroll through my texts and get weird about random stuff: “Why did you use a heart emoji with your ex husband?” or “You planned coffee with Sam and didn’t tell me first?”. I’d explain, she’d say she believes me, but next week it’d happen again with something else. Meanwhile, I never even asked to see her phone because honestly? I don’t care what memes her group chat is sharing.  

So I changed my password thinking we could talk about boundaries. Big mistake. She compared it to ripping up a legal contract and said I crossed her ultimate dealbreaker line. I tried compromising (offering shared location, joint social media logins) but she insisted phones are the “foundation of trust”. Now we’re stuck: she says I betrayed our original agreement, I say relationships need room to grow and adjust rules.  

Am I being unreasonable here? Guys who’ve been through this – how do you balance privacy with transparency? If your partner suddenly wanted phone access 24/7, would you give it? Trying to make sense of this.

1kgsh2c,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1kgsh2c/whats_going_on_with_my_friend/,What’s going on with my friend?,"This is a situation that requires background so I’m sorry if this is long, I’ve just been sitting on ts and need advice from strangers who don’t know this person. She’s been acting weird af towards me and I have a feeling she’s been in a more bizarre situation than she’s letting on, so hopefully y’all can be entertained by my turmoil in some way LOL.  

I (24f) have been pretty butt hurt recently because I have a friend (23f) who keeps telling me how busy she is and not making time to hang out with me but I know for a fact she’s spending time with other people and just choosing not to spend time with me. She’s been one of my best friends since high school and we’ve been really close until her most recent relationship. He was a narcissist and she dated him for 2 years. one time she was texting me about him abusing her and I was trying to help her and he read her texts on her iPad, which then made him hate me and isolate her from me for the rest of their relationship. She still hung out with me a few times but only if he was “supervising” and it was just really weird and sh*tty, like we had to censor our friendship to protect her/appease him. I could tell she was completely absorbed in the manipulation and abusive dynamic so I’ve never held it against her because that stuff is so hard, and she was raised by a narcissistic mom so she was conditioned to it. I eventually told myself I’d be here for her when she finally left him and we still texted semi-often, I always told her I’m here for her if she needs me. I had my own life to take care of and you can’t make someone find better if they aren’t recognizing their reality (trust me I tried). All I ever did was try to be a good friend to her. I knew she’d break up with him eventually and I was really excited when she finally did this past December. It was during my finals week and I was literally leaving for a trip right after the semester ended, so I couldn’t drop everything and drive 40 minutes away at that time to support her (with no knowledge that was gonna happen that week) and honestly after being blown off for two years because of this man and multiple times of showing up for her bc of this man I chose to be there for her emotionally over text and phone call but have boundaries- I think after a while it’s like becoming an enabler when u give 100% support to someone who isn’t making the obvious right choice for themself. That being said, I still never hold what she went thru with him against her and I’m so proud of her for leaving, now for what I’m ACTUALLY butt hurt about almost 3 months after she broke up with him. 

So like I said she lives about 40 minutes away from me, over an hour during busy times of the day. I live in the asscrack of a city and she lives in a town right outside the city. It’s just a highway away but like I said the commute is crazy and when we see each other it’s best to have a whole day or a sleepover, which we haven’t had in forever bc of the man and bc of life and stuff. She’s a hairdresser for a living so I’ve driven up there for hair appointments and seen her every few months bc of that (one of the only ways I could while she was with him) but right now I’m about to graduate with my bachelors from college and I’m a broke student and I’m just not in a place right now where I’ve been able to make it up there to see her. I got tired of asking her to come see me at my apartment (that she’s only seen once since I moved in the only time she’s come to see me) and I’ve been under the impression that we are both really busy with school and work, we have opposite schedules, and that’s just life rn for two busy girls/we will have more time after I graduate. Well, all she says is how busy she is with work, but I’ve picked up in our phone calls that she’s always talking about these other friends she’s hanging out with. One of them also just went through a break up, and I understand going through heartbreak at the same time as someone else can be really special for support so I totally understood that, also them living closer, but then I noticed other things that rly got on my nerves. She keeps telling me she’s done dating for a long time, she can’t deal with a man right now which like 100% valid, and yet this next part I’m gonna explain is kinda weird so bear with me. 

The particular friend who’s going through a break up is actually in a situation with her HUSBAND where they are separated bc she wanted to be poly/date women. She decided she wants women so he’s just been floating around, but they are still legally married and living together. It always feels like there’s more to the story that she isn’t telling me. She has another friend who she met thru this girl in the SAME situation, being poly with her man and then deciding she wants women, but this girl still lives with her husband AND behaves as his partner despite this. They all hung out as a group which led my friend to befriend all of them, and now, every time we have chatted over text she’s hanging out with one of the HUSBANDS and not one of the girls. In fact she’s been hanging out with one of them one on one it seems during all her free time/days off. Now I’m not about to say anything about polygamy, yall do what you like and etc idc! I’ve never said anything negative that would indicate I’d be against it if that’s what she chose with her life. But she told me she is not interested in that and they’re just her friends and she doesn’t want to date let alone be poly right now. Also, it would probably mess up her friendship with the girls who she befriended in the first place despite them being separated. Girl code is like that. She told me she’s for sure monogamous and has no plan of changing that.  

Well, in one of our recent conversations she told me that she has had to friend zone both of these guys after they expressed interest in her. She’s absolutely adorable and gorgeous and every guy she’s ever been friends with has caught feelings for her, so I wasn’t surprised at all and I honestly saw it coming. I felt like she was avoiding telling me honestly because in high school, there was a situation where in our friend group, two of the guys had a crush on her and she friend zoned them despite falling asleep on Facetime with one of them every night. The two guys had been friends since childhood and ended their friendship because of guy code/both liking her and her being that close with one of them. He got his heart shattered inevitably. At the time I was like hey, that’s not cool, but it was high school. That’s high school stuff, right? Well, i’ve noticed a theme that she really likes having guy friends who like her but are in the friend zone. She always plays dumb and says that she just wants to be their friend and it sucks so bad that they like her, but at this point we’re both grown adults and I feel like she just likes the attention. Like I said earlier she’s adorable and I’m not lying or exaggerating, so I feel like she’s used to playing dumb and getting away with it. I’ve had guys confessed their feelings to me before and unfortunately it’s usually best to just end the friendship bc otherwise they will get hurt in the long run, at least in my experience it’s the right thing to do. 

Well, a few weekends ago I went to a friend’s grad party at an arcade close to my apartment, on MY side of town. Shortly after I got there guess who I saw walking through the door? Miss girl with one of these men!!! I panicked because I was there at the function to support someone and I wasn’t about to invite two extra people to a party that I got a formal invitation to, especially when one of them is a random older guy that I’ve never met before and a lot of friends at this grad party are still freshman and are 18/19 years old. I forgot to mention that these guys are older than her. Not by too much, but like 28/maybe 30s? And she’s 23 as a reminder. The man imo would be too old to be at a college grad party as a peer with the crowd I was with basically. So my bf (my plus one) and I told her we’d catch up with her later and continued to go find my grad friend. My blood was boiling because she’s been too busy to come to my side of town and yet here she is! I felt like I was going to cry the rest of the night. After a few hours the party started to die down and I saw her sitting in the eating area so my boyfriend and I went over to say hi again and catch up a little. At this point the other guy had showed up too so she was there with both of them at the same time, and the look on her face looked guilty and uncomfortable AF. We were friendly and when I walked away my boyfriend immediately turned to me and was like wtf? He’s met her a few times and we’re all friends so he noticed the look on her face too. He also said both the guys looked pissed that the other was there. I told him the situation and how hurt I’ve been feeling already because I thought after she left her abusive boyfriend she’d want to hang out with me more, but instead she’s been spending time with these new people and I have no idea what’s actually going on. Then, she shows up literally 8 min away from my apartment after apparently not having the time to come see me. Mind you, I am also about to have a huge life transition graduating college and I’ve been working hard all the time on my final assignments. I also am 1 year sober and so I haven’t had a job for the first time since starting college bc the time I’d be spending working part time I’ve been instead going to meetings and staying involved in recovery. She has a fully established career 9-5, makes plenty of money, and at this stage of my life I feel like it’s not too much to ask for her to be the one to come see me, especially bc I’ve been the one making the trip for years and I’m temporarily not making income and eating my savings to get thru my last semester before I enter the workforce. Point is, can she spend the gas money for once to show up for me bare minimum? I cried in the car after the function and my bf was totally on my side (he’s a king fr) and he also seemed worried about her bc of her bizarre behavior and entanglement with two married men in tumultuous marriages. 

A few days later I asked if she could FaceTime to have a talk and so we had a call later that day and I told her about how I’ve been feeling , it’s kind of embarrassing to be crying over someone who idk even misses me like that, etc. I also told her I feel like she’s keeping secrets from me and I’ve never been a judgmental friend so what the heck is going on. I’ve only ever been real with her and told her when I feel like she’s in danger or asked her what’s going on and stuff, I don’t like making assumptions and I always wanna hear her side, so why do I feel like she’s been actively avoiding me and hiding things? She further explained the situation and seemed really defensive when I asked her if both of them are still legally married. I was literally just asking, but she acted like I was accusing her of something. She said she was just trying to get the two guys together because they’re in the same situation with their wives and she feels like they should be friends. That’s the story she stuck with throughout the whole call and I kinda believe her, but I also said I could tell both guys looked like they wanted her to themselves and she said “yeahhh I felt like you’d pick up on that vibe”. The way she said it sounded guilty!!! Idk why she is acting like I’m her mom or something, the main issue I have is she’s been failing to show up in OUR friendship, not that she’s in some mysterious entanglement. 

She said that she’s glad I told her how I felt and she apologized and all that. She admitted she hasn’t been making time to come see me and she didn’t want to sit there and make excuses. I really hated that I was crying while I was telling her how I felt because honestly it’s really embarrassing to have to tell somebody that you want them to hang out with you when clearly they don’t. she said she does feel really weird about the situation with the two guys especially because one of them has started sending her things like coffee and pastries at work and gets her little presents when they hang out together. I did tell her that I’m worried she’s gonna end up in something messy since both of these guys have been burned by their wives, and the one particular guy who’s clearly trying to win her affection after being friends zoned seemed to be the most hurt by his separation from his wife (from what she’s told me). I was just asking her questions about what she’s been up to because honestly I just wanted her to talk to me about it, I’m supposed to be her best friend! I wouldn’t be so bothered by her behavior if I didn’t feel like she was keeping secrets from me and avoiding me. I’m not a judgmental person and I’m really good about being there for my friends when they need me, I’ve had multiple people attest to that, so maybe she’s just resentful that she knows I’m going to be curious about what’s going on with her and I’m gonna be protective of her too after her most recent breakup (and her ex before him was crummy too)! 


Basically, what do you guys think is going on? She’s not completely avoidant in our friendship because she still likes to text me at least once a week, and she’s always telling me she misses me and stuff but I’m starting to wonder if she’s being a people pleaser when she says that. I’ve already figured out that she’s just been prioritizing her other friends over me, but I feel like she doesn’t want to end our friendship. I’m still the person she always turns to when she needs a real one, we are pretty vulnerable with each other in the way only childhood friends are. I feel more like she’s crashing out or something and just doesn’t want me to perceive her because she knows I know her super well and would be able to tell. I also feel like she’s more male-centered than I ever allowed myself to recognize, and I feel like she really likes the attention from these guys she’s hanging out with almost like a drug. Have any of you ever been in a situation like this? Do y’all think I should keep trying with her or do you think this is a lesson for me about friendship? Is there any insight or advice y’all have that I might not be perceptive of?

Me and my partner have a rental house together while our new house is being built. The housemate I mentioned in the title was living with his auntie, but due to criminal activity in the home, he needed to leave (he’s not the criminal). He can’t afford any rent, so his parents pay us $50 a week. My partner pays $350 a week, and I look after the house and pay for groceries (I’m a Uni student). When housemate moved in, we made an agreement that he is to help out around the house as well. Recently, I’ve begun to notice that I’m the only one who actually makes the house functional. I always put away the dishes from the drying rack (even his dishes), I’m always vacuuming and mopping, I take care of all the dogs (we have 5). All housemate does is either stay in his room, go to work, or watches TV for the whole day. And this is usually when my partner is away for work. He began complaining that we don’t have a coffee table in front of the TV. Which I think is valid, as I like to eat dinner there sometimes- and there’s no table. So, me and my partner moved a small, but heavy, table in front of the couch. Anyway, housemate moved it back to wherever it was. So, I moved it back in front of the couch. I then come out the next morning and he’s moved it away again. Am I overreacting to this? I am actually so annoyed that we made an effort to move a table, because he was complaining, but now he moves it away. He’s the laziest housemate, never picks up a vacuum.

1kgsh0t,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExecutiveAssistants/comments/1kgsh0t/caught_between_2_execs_differences/,Caught between 2 execs differences.,"Today I followed instruction from our CEO to ensure a meeting room was presented in a certain way - tidied, some items removed, and ensure that refreshments and coffee were provided.
Our COO and CFO together made comments to me while I was alone with them that suggested I / or the CEO were making too much fuss and that we should be authentic in how our offices look, that the guests had been before and there is no need to go to the extent that we were. The communication from the COO was quite strong in frustration, a little accusatory and then almost defensive in their stance. It definitely felt like this was a trigger point. 

I responded that it was great our CEO cared about  these things, her brand awareness and reputation of the business was important. I also politely reminded that I was following instruction regardless of my own views and that I’d be happy to pass on their feedback. I also highlighted that diversity in thought is what keeps it interesting! 

It’s not happened often in my time as an EA but today’s occurrence has really hit a nerve and I’ve reacted quite strongly (internally!) and I’m not sure why. 

I’d love any feedback or advice on how to manage this next time as I’m concerned it’s becoming a bit of a recurring theme.  

For context, our CEO and I are new to the business (months) and the COO and CFO are years in and sit together in the same office, they appear as a united front with a tight bond. I respect the CEO and her desires to lead the business are new and different to the previous CEO, and understand change is hard for everybody. 

I’m not sure why this interaction has really struck a nerve in me; all day I’ve been unable to shake it. I trust in how I responded was appropriate and feel like perhaps I’m sensing a bigger problem here.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The appeal of green quartz countertops lies in their unique combination of aesthetics and practicality. Understanding the key features will help you select the perfect option for your needs.

**Durability and Strength:**

Green quartz countertops are engineered from a mixture of natural quartz crystals and resin binders. This manufacturing process creates a surface that is exceptionally resistant to scratches, stains, and impacts. The non-porous nature of quartz also prevents the absorption of liquids, minimizing the risk of bacterial growth and making it incredibly easy to clean and maintain. This inherent durability ensures that your countertops will maintain their beauty for years to come, even in high-traffic areas.

**Color and Pattern Variety:**

Unlike natural stone, quartz countertops offer a wide array of color options and patterns, including various shades and veining patterns of green. From deep forest greens to light, subtle mint hues, you can find a shade that perfectly complements your kitchen or bathroom d茅cor. The controlled manufacturing process allows for consistent color distribution, ensuring that each slab matches your expectations and delivers a uniform look across your countertop surface.

**Low Maintenance Requirements:**

One of the most significant advantages of green quartz countertops is their low maintenance requirements. Unlike granite or marble, quartz does not require sealing. Regular cleaning with mild soap and water is sufficient to keep your countertops looking their best. The non-porous surface also prevents staining from common household spills, such as coffee, wine, or juice, making it a practical choice for busy households.

**Consistent Quality and Appearance:**

Quartz countertops are manufactured under controlled conditions, resulting in consistent quality and appearance across each slab. This eliminates the variability found in natural stone, where patterns and colors can vary significantly from one slab to another. The uniform appearance of quartz allows for easier design planning and ensures that your countertops will meet your aesthetic expectations. This predictability is a major advantage for homeowners seeking a cohesive and consistent look in their kitchens or bathrooms.

**Eco-Friendliness:**

Many manufacturers are incorporating sustainable practices into the production of quartz countertops. This includes using recycled materials, such as glass or porcelain, as part of the quartz mixture. Additionally, the durability and longevity of quartz countertops contribute to their eco-friendliness by reducing the need for frequent replacements. Choosing green quartz can be a responsible choice for environmentally conscious consumers.

 ## Core Benefits

Choosing green quartz countertops offers several core benefits that enhance both the functionality and aesthetic appeal of your space.

**Enhanced Aesthetic Appeal:** The natural beauty of green quartz countertops adds a touch of elegance and sophistication to any kitchen or bathroom. The unique color variations and veining patterns provide a visual interest that complements a wide range of design styles, from modern and minimalist to traditional and rustic. The soothing green hues can create a calming and inviting atmosphere, making your space more enjoyable and relaxing.

**Increased Durability and Longevity:** Quartz countertops are known for their exceptional durability, which translates to a long lifespan. Their resistance to scratches, stains, and impacts ensures that they can withstand the rigors of daily use without showing signs of wear and tear. This longevity makes them a cost-effective investment in the long run, as you won't need to replace them as frequently as other countertop materials.

**Easy Cleaning and Maintenance:** The non-porous surface of quartz makes it incredibly easy to clean and maintain. Spills and messes can be quickly wiped away with a damp cloth and mild soap, without the need for harsh chemicals or specialized cleaning products. This ease of maintenance saves you time and effort, allowing you to focus on enjoying your kitchen or bathroom.

**Hygienic Surface:** The non-porous nature of quartz also makes it a hygienic surface for food preparation. Unlike porous materials like granite or marble, quartz does not harbor bacteria or germs, making it a safer choice for your family. This is particularly important in kitchens, where foodborne illnesses can be a concern.

 ## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about green quartz countertops to help you make an informed decision.

**Are green quartz countertops susceptible to staining?**
    No, green quartz countertops are highly resistant to staining due to their non-porous surface. Common household spills, such as coffee, wine, or juice, can be easily wiped away without leaving any permanent marks. However, it is always recommended to clean up spills promptly to prevent any potential discoloration.

**Can green quartz countertops withstand high heat?**
    While quartz is heat-resistant, it is not entirely heatproof. Prolonged exposure to high heat, such as placing a hot pan directly on the surface, can potentially cause damage or discoloration. It is always recommended to use trivets or hot pads to protect your countertops from excessive heat.

**What is the typical lifespan of green quartz countertops?**
    With proper care and maintenance, green quartz countertops can last for many years. Their durability and resistance to wear and tear make them a long-lasting investment. Most manufacturers offer warranties that range from 10 to 25 years, providing added peace of mind.

**Do green quartz countertops require sealing?**
    No, green quartz countertops do not require sealing. Their non-porous surface naturally resists stains and moisture absorption, eliminating the need for periodic sealing. This makes them a low-maintenance and hassle-free option for homeowners.

Sometimes the pleasure of giving something away derives from the fact that you are depriving yourself of pleasure. Like giving away a piece of cake to your neighbor instead of eating it yourself. I had thought that was the kinda sacrifical enjoyment that would envelop me, instead a suit of cold sweat compressed my skin. Nicole kidman put her hand on my shoulder and i did a fistbump with Denzel Washington. I tried to keep the facade up, in fact, i had done a really majestic thing. I shouldn't even have to put up a fake face, i had been selfless even if i did regret it something fierce. But my body shook in it's place as sweat poured down my forehead into the corner of my eyes. All i could see infront of me was bills, transport, take-out, cat litter, new phone, zyn, spotify subscription, thrift shirts, rent, snicker bar.

1kgsczl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxietyHealing/comments/1kgsczl/anxiety_and_young_adults_what_no_one_really_talks/,Anxiety and Young Adults: What No One Really Talks About,"There’s this weird myth that your twenties are supposed to be “the best years of your life.” Freedom, adventure, figuring it all out. But for a lot of young adults, that’s not what it feels like at all. It feels more like pressure, comparison, and a low-key identity crisis that no one trained you for.

And anxiety? It’s often lurking quietly in the background—or crashing in like a wave you didn’t see coming.

Let’s talk honestly about why anxiety hits young adults so hard, what it looks like, and how to get real support without pretending you’ve got it all together.

---

## So... Why Is Anxiety So Common in Young Adults?

You’re not imagining it. Anxiety disorders are *more* common in people under 30 than any other age group. And no, it’s not just because of social media (though that sure doesn’t help).

Here’s what’s really going on:

- **Life transitions.** Moving out, starting (and maybe quitting) jobs, college, relationships—it’s a lot all at once.
- **Uncertainty overload.** What career do you want? Will you ever afford a house? Should you be doing more?
- **Social comparison.** Everyone else’s “perfect life” is always on display. Yours? Not so much.
- **Brain chemistry.** Fun fact: your prefrontal cortex (the part that helps regulate emotion) is still developing in your early twenties.

Put all of that together, and it’s no wonder so many young adults are dealing with panic attacks, insomnia, constant worry, and a feeling of being *on edge* all the time.

---

## How Anxiety Shows Up in Young Adults (It’s Not Always Obvious)

Anxiety doesn’t always look like hyperventilating or hiding under the covers. Sometimes it shows up in sneakier ways:

- You procrastinate—not because you’re lazy, but because starting feels overwhelming.
- Your chest feels tight *every* time your phone rings.
- You overthink every text, email, or social interaction.
- You can’t sleep, or you sleep too much.
- You feel fine until suddenly you’re *not*, and you don’t know why.

And here’s the kicker: sometimes, you don’t even realize it’s anxiety. You just think you’re bad at life, when really, your nervous system is running on overdrive.

---

## You're Not Weak—You're Human

There’s this silent expectation that by your twenties, you should have it together. Like some magical adult switch flips when you graduate or get your first “real” job.

Spoiler: that switch doesn’t exist.

It’s okay to not be okay. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed, uncertain, or like everyone else got the manual and you didn’t. None of that makes you broken. It makes you *normal*—and in need of support, not shame.

---

## Real Talk: What Can Help

Let’s get practical. Dealing with anxiety isn’t about “just calming down” or “thinking positive.” It’s about real tools and habits that support your nervous system and emotional well-being.

Here’s what that might include:

- **Movement:** Not to lose weight. Just to let your body burn off anxious energy.
- **Sleep hygiene:** Yes, your phone in bed is probably messing with your brain. No judgment, but maybe give it a curfew.
- **Daily rituals:** A few minutes of journaling, stretching, or just drinking coffee in silence can create a sense of grounding.
- **Limiting doomscrolling:** Not everything online deserves your attention.
- **Support systems:** Friends, family, chosen family—people you can be real with.

And if you need more support? That’s what [online therapy](https://therapyrank.com/online-therapy) is for. It’s private, flexible, and actually helpful—not just some formal thing for “serious” people. You can talk about everything from panic attacks to roommate drama without judgment.

---

## You Deserve to Feel Safe in Your Own Mind

Anxiety doesn’t mean you’re broken. It means you’re responding to a world that’s... kind of chaotic, especially when you’re trying to figure out who you are and where you’re going.

You don’t have to “tough it out.” You don’t have to wait until you’re in full meltdown mode. Support is a valid choice, even when things feel “fine but not really.”

You’re allowed to want more peace, more clarity, more steadiness. And you don’t have to get there alone.

Honestly? You shouldn’t have to.

So I spent the time yesterday at his apartment. He wanted me to stay for three days, but I went home yesterday, although we haven’t seen each other in 7 months. His apartment is a little cold, because he smokes weed the whole day. And I feel uncomfortable. Then it took him until 4 p.m. to actually make breakfast, so I've been starving as well. 

In total he played games for eight hours yesterday and also in the morning and I kind of outgrew this lifestyle because it really turns me off having a man in front of me playing games while I'm there. 
In the past, I accepted it because I wanted to spend time with him and he wasn't nice to me in the past, so that's what I got. And I was happy with what I got at least, because I could be beside him while he plays games. But now, for me this is unacceptable.
And I will stop meeting him after this week cause he wants me to be in his apartment just so that he can live his everyday life with a woman by his side, doing his everyday tasks. I’m not a housemaid or housekeeper lol. The money I would give him for rent is money I could invest every month, so it’s a no. He would actually make me bankrupt..

The new SP that I was dating until a month ago, he went out with me to drink coffee and he wanted to spend all his time with me. He prioritized me without me doing anything and he cooked me as much food as I want. I mean, probably my SP will do this too, but his schedule in his everyday life is not what I want. And he wants me to come over today again. And I told him, maybe I come, but I won't haha. Later this week I will go there again because I have unfinished business with him. And I want to kiss him by myself at least )I’m always too shy for that). I just want to see if he introduces me to his mom, like he says, and if he doesn't I will remove myself from this SP situation.",2,1746606422.0,lawofassumption,6,0.62,False

 ## Key Features Analysis

The best decorative glass bowls stand out due to their superior craftsmanship, unique designs, and versatile functionality. These features ensure that each bowl not only serves its purpose but also adds a touch of elegance to its surroundings.

**Material Quality and Durability:** High-quality glass is paramount for a decorative bowl. The best bowls are crafted from lead-free crystal or durable borosilicate glass. These materials offer exceptional clarity, allowing the colors and textures of the bowl to shine. They also resist chipping and cracking, ensuring longevity. Some bowls feature added thickness for enhanced durability, making them suitable for everyday use.

The composition of the glass directly impacts its visual appeal and strength. Lead-free crystal provides a brilliant sparkle and clarity, while borosilicate glass offers superior heat resistance, making it ideal for holding hot foods or liquids. The manufacturing process, whether hand-blown or machine-made, also affects the glass's overall quality and structural integrity.

**Design and Aesthetics:** The design of a decorative glass bowl should complement its intended setting. Bowls come in a wide range of styles, from minimalist contemporary designs to ornate, vintage-inspired pieces. Key design elements include the bowl's shape, color, texture, and any added embellishments. The best bowls exhibit a harmonious balance of these elements, creating a visually appealing and cohesive design.

Consider bowls with unique textures, such as ribbed or hammered glass, to add tactile interest. Color plays a crucial role, with options ranging from clear and neutral tones to vibrant hues and multi-colored designs. Added embellishments, like gold leaf or hand-painted details, can elevate the bowl's aesthetic and make it a focal point in any room.

**Size and Capacity:** The size and capacity of a decorative glass bowl should align with its intended use. Smaller bowls, typically under 8 inches in diameter, are ideal for holding small items like jewelry, potpourri, or candies. Medium-sized bowls, ranging from 8 to 12 inches, work well as fruit bowls or centerpieces. Larger bowls, exceeding 12 inches, can serve as statement pieces or for holding larger items like decorative stones or floral arrangements.

Consider the depth of the bowl as well. A shallow bowl is perfect for displaying items, while a deeper bowl is better suited for holding liquids or preventing items from spilling. Always measure the space where you plan to place the bowl to ensure it fits comfortably and doesn't overwhelm the area.

**Stability and Balance:** A well-designed decorative glass bowl should be stable and balanced to prevent tipping or wobbling. The base of the bowl should be wide and sturdy, providing a solid foundation. Bowls with uneven bottoms or poorly designed bases can be prone to tipping, which can be both inconvenient and potentially dangerous.

Look for bowls with a weighted base for added stability. The weight should be evenly distributed to ensure the bowl remains upright even when filled with items. Also, check for non-slip pads or feet on the base to prevent the bowl from sliding on smooth surfaces.

**Ease of Cleaning and Maintenance:** A decorative glass bowl should be easy to clean and maintain to preserve its beauty and longevity. Opt for bowls that are dishwasher-safe for convenient cleaning. However, hand-washing is often recommended for delicate or intricately designed bowls to prevent damage.

Avoid using abrasive cleaners or scouring pads, as these can scratch or dull the glass. Instead, use mild soap and warm water to gently clean the bowl. For stubborn stains or residue, try using a mixture of vinegar and water. Always dry the bowl thoroughly after washing to prevent water spots or cloudiness.

(stomach issues),"Hello, so i am someone really not affraid to eat about anything (street food, etc), and been 5 months in SEA and never had food poisoning.

I'm eating pretty much everywhere, just avoiding some places sometimes just if I don't feel eat, but mostly eating local 70% of the time.

Because i'm not used to take care especifically of my stomach, I always eat pretty much everything local, and just go to poop a little more because of the ""not good"" local food for my stomach.

In the western worlds I took habits, usually eat a lot of bread and pastas which I guess make the balance in my stomach with the rest I eat during the day and that may be harmful for my stomach : coffee, sweets, fried things, orange juice, etc..

So in the western world I don't have to be careful because with my normal regime i'm already okay.

But in SEA, most of things are fried, and like, I'm never too careful, I eat everything and therefore my stomach is very often not very good. I go very often to poop, because with what I eat : fried chicken and rice, very often with spicy local sauce, and other local's delicacys, often fried, I want to poop very often, and I post because I realize it's not so enjoyable.

In the western world typically it's really the bread I think that balance everything, so for example when the day start, bread will balance my stomach and make me able to eat pretty much everything I want on the side.

But in SEA bread isn't available, so I have to adapt. Most of the time the rice don't make me the same stomach effect as bread in my stomach. Even plain rice, which is often what I choose, but with a little bit of spicy sauce to be enjoyable, but even without, don't make my stomach balanced like bread do.


As someone living in SEA it's very often my breakfast consist of rice and chicken, and I don't have many choices.

I really don't know what should i mainly do / being care of to ease my stomach/transit. It's really a problem as wanting to poop 3 to 5 times a day is not really fun, and I actually not always have good toilets available so it make all the thing pretty much annoying.

I guess I should focus on one or two things, to make my transit slower, therefore having less time the need to go to poop, and also I hope avoiding little stomach uncomfort.

What would you advice? which kind of widely available food in sea I should focus on, to ease this western stomach? what i'm doing very wrong? 

The best would be to have something to eat often that balance everything but unfortunately rice don't make the job! it does compare to fried food (plain rice), but nothing compare to bread or pasta.
