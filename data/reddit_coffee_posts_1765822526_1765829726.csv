Most solutions force trade-offs:



  
\- decent UX but high conversion fees

  
\- low fees but slow or unreliable transactions

  
\- fast payments, but awkward onboarding or delayed deposits/withdrawals



  
For something as basic as paying for coffee or a subscription, none of that really works. In real-world situations, people expect payments to be instant, predictable, and not eat into the value just to convert. It feels like the space doesn’t need more features or tokens here, it needs a payment-focused app that treats speed, transparency, and reliability as non-negotiable, not optional.

1pnh0as,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_Relationships/comments/1pnh0as/aita_for_voicing_my_discomfort_to_my_gf/,AITA for voicing my discomfort to my GF?,"My girlfriend of 5 months the was having a bad mental health day and was spiralling emotionally a few days ago. She’s a former alcoholic, but has been sober for a while. I was there to listen to her, but my ability to help was limited since i’ve never been an addict.

Later that day, she went to an AA meeting then proceeded to go to a coffee shop with a male friend she met through AA. Despite me being uncomfortable with her going to a coffee shop 1:1 with a guy at night, I kept it to myself since she was having a bad day and I didn’t want to make it worse. A few days later, she had another AA meeting, and informed me she was going to pick this same guy up as his car broke down and he happened to be on the way. I uncomfortable with this, but said nothing. At this point, I planned to keep my discomfort to myself as I do trusted her, and I know that my discomfort comes from a places of jealousy which is something I am working on.

After picking him up and going to the meeting which was already happening quite late in the evening, I heard nothing from her until 1 AM. She told me that the entire group and her ended up going somewhere and hanging out, and sent me pictures of the hangout. During all of this, I was anxious as it’s not in her habit to do things late at night without giving me a heads up since I do have an anxious attachment style. To be clear, I don’t need her to text me every minute of the day, but we are consistent with communication and keep one another updated about plans.

I ended up calling her the next day and voicing the fact that I was uncomfortable with the 1:1 meetings she was having with this guy.  She got defensive and thought I was implying infidelity, which was not at all the case. In turn, I clarified that it had nothing to do with infidelity, and I was just more-so jealous and wanted to express my discomfort. I also had no expectations for her to stop meeting people in her AA network, but still felt that I needed to express my discomfort to her. In turn, understandably, she told me that she’d now have to stop as if she didn’t, she’d be hurting me.

She then proceeded to offer to not 1:1 meet up with any male friends, but her tone was clearly aggressive. She also went on to say she was an independent person, and did not appreciate that I was trying to control her. I told her she could continue to meet with whom she liked, and I also understood that she now felt pressured to not do so because of my discomfort, but I told her about how I felt because I didn’t want my emotions to bottle up leading to me resenting her. In the end, I asked her to just keep me in the loop when she’s out especially if it’s a situation similar to this one.

Later that day, she came over but was being very cold with me initially. After a while, she started warming up and she said she just wanted to move past it the whole thing. We laughed and got lovey-dovey, which led to us getting intimate, and her sleeping over. In the morning, she left for work but everything felt like it went back to how it was prior to this fight. All of that being said; l’m now kind of hesitant to share my feelings about anything because I feel like I achieved nothing by doing so while also causing a fight. I also feel like I was an asshole the context of this being AA related.

I’m aware of my anxious attachment style, and i’m also working on my jealousy issues. I do trust her, and i’m not in any way trying to control her. That being said; I’m a person too after all, and I have flaws. I can’t help but feel like I might have wrecked our relationship? I’m also worried that by expressing my discomfort, she might not share things with me anymore in fear of upsetting me.

Throughout our friendship, there were recurring moments when she would lash out at me, humiliate me in front of others, or ignore me, leaving me feeling insignificant. When I addressed this years down the line, she said it was connected to being in a five-year abusive relationship at the time, and I tried to be understanding.

Years later, I entered a relationship, and my partner moved in with me. I soon became uncomfortable with K’s behaviour around him. She often spoke graphically about her sex life in front of him, crossed physical boundaries ( ex. putting her feel under his lap) , and spent time alone with him that didn’t feel appropriate. One time, they disappeared together, went out for dinner without me, and ignored my calls. Once, I came home unexpectedly to find her naked in my house while my partner was there. Whenever I raised concerns, I was manipulated,gaslit, and made to believe I was seeing things that weren't there.

Last summer, I ended the relationship with my boyfriend due to his emotional abuse and chronic infidelity. He disclosed that he is a sex addict and has been attending Sex Addicts Anonymous. He said he loved me and he didn't have any attraction to the people he would have sex with him. He stated he would have sex with anyone that wanted to despite who they were what they looked like age, gender, attarctiveness non of that mattered they were just there to fuel his sexual compulsion. In hindsight, I believe this dynamic contributed to the way he treated her, just as he did with others. And she then took his misstreatment to lash out on me.

Because of my history of abandonment, abuse, and complex PTSD, I saw K as chosen family. She expressed love toward me alongside mistreatment, which mirrored the way I had learned to understand love growing up. My ex was the first person who made me feel safe and cared for, so I refused to believe either of them could betray me.

Recently, after my ex invited me on a spa getaway, I checked his phone and discovered that he and K had been having an affair for years. She had been sending him nude photos, sexting him, and lying to me while helping him cover it up. When I confronted her, she became violent threw her coffee at me and insisted I was a bad friend for talking about her with him. Even though she had been sharing my private life with him the entire time, and put me in danger by asking him about concerns I had when he became erratic towards me. She wasnt concern he will hurt me when I disclosed he had been acting erratically, she was concerned he would reveal their secret..

I feel deeply violated and betrayed by both of them. I am still living with my ex due to financial dependence, which has been extremely distressing. While I am relieved that both relationships are over, coming to terms with the fact that my best friend mistreated me and may have seen me as an enemy or competition has been deeply painful.

What I’m mad about tho, is how everything occurred.

I ended up using a friends laptop (super lucky and grateful), but I was always so stressed bcuz of the panic😂

Again, that was my fault lol. Should have doubled, tripled check.

First section (RC) went smooth, second was…

I drank so much coffee, Celsius, and really just any caffeine I could find. I know again, stupid. So much fluid, that I had to pee during the exam. But as you know, you can’t leave the room during the exam, especially remote without raising a flag. 

During my second section, I had to pee so bad, I kept texting the proctor if I could go to the bathroom at the end of the section. She kept saying during my break, I asked when was that, I think she said end of the third section. Now my panic was PANICKING 😭 I couldn’t stop jittering and genuinely had to pee so bad, to the point I stopped thinking of the test and rather how to hold my pee in.

1pngl53,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pngl53,"My experience with Fix Coffee - Grinder upgrade, Learned Lessons","Hi everyone,
I’ve been meaning to post this for a while, mostly to share my experience and close the loop. This was my first time buying a premium hand grinder, going from a Cafe Jei to, rolls credit, the 1Zpresso K-Ultra from FixCoffee in Lucknow.

I got the grinder the day after ordering, which was great. But the handle felt unusually stiff, not at the start (which I know is normal) but midway through the swing. I sent them a video the next day, before my phone broke that same evening. So yes, the timing couldn’t have been worse.

A few days later, while getting ready for the AeroPress Championship, I noticed a small dent at the bottom of the grinder, while comparing everything about mine (like a geek) with another participant’s one-year-old K-Ultra and realized mine was indeed dented. I immediately shared the photo and details with FixCoffee, still within the 7-day return period.

To be fair, it was partly my oversight — it was my first premium grinder, the dent was underneath, the rush of purchase, and my phone breaking didn’t help. But what disappointed me was how the situation was handled. Instead of feeling heard, I felt like I was on trial for doing something wrong. The tone was defensive and dismissive when all I wanted was clarity and a bit of empathy.

Eventually, after I wrote directly to 1Zpresso (catagorically mentioning the timeline of events), the issue was finally acknowledged and resolved. They were professional and above all kind, which I appreciated.

Would I still recommend FixCoffee? Honestly, yes. They’ve done great work bringing niche stuff like 1Zpresso to India, and that deserves credit. But customer service-wise, there’s a lot to 'FIX' You can sell premium gear, but you also need premium communication, empathy included. Customers shouldn’t feel like they’re inconveniencing you, even in a niche space that’s always felt a little too snobby to the ""learners"".

In hindsight, it was a mix of my bad luck, timing, and their poor communication. Lesson learned. Still love 1Zpresso, my dream grinder, still love-love-love brewing, just a little wiser and paranoid now.

If you've read till now, thank you. I always wanted to put this out there as my final review of the platform.

By the time I was seen, my pain was basically gone. They gave me a steroid and sent me home. The nurse told me it definitely sounds like nerve pain. I didn’t get any other answers. 

Tuesday, I had what I can only describe as a full on nerve attack. My muscles in my legs all the way down tensed up so bad it got to a point I couldn’t bend my knees for a few hours. I screamed and cried in pain, I couldn’t stay still, but couldn’t move my legs the way I needed to. I was also alone with the baby until 2, and I had been in pain since 8am. I couldn’t even bend my legs to feed/change my baby. 🫠 By the time my boyfriend got home I was drenched in sweat. I had knocked over my coffee and it went everywhere. I couldn’t believe my neighbors didn’t call the cops because I had been crying so loud all day. All I had to take was my low dose muscle relaxer and it didn’t do anything for me. I called my neurology office and they sent in prednisone, but I couldn’t get that til after 2. I was in pain until after 5pm. We put the heating pad under my knees (I have a lot of localized pain behind my knees/behind my thighs if anybody knows what that’s about), tried getting me as propped up as possible. My boyfriend had to adjust my legs/feet (bend them at the knee, stretch them) for me probably 284x.

On Wednesday I had my neurology follow up. I had been mentally preparing myself for a few weeks for an EMG because I’ve been afraid of what the nerve stimulation might do - I actually did really good, I barely cried! But, they weren’t even going to do it. I told the dr I was too freaked out from what happened and it would give me some peace of mind. So he did one, only stuck my left leg this time. But he said my nerves are healing beautifully, and I actually got my last Vyvgart Hytrulo injection yesterday. He insists that the medication has ran its course and now it’s just up to my body to finish the healing process. He prescribed me a high dose muscle relaxer, and gabapentin to help with pain management. Apparently the pain, tremors/twitching is the nerves healing because my brain is making them over-fire. Someone fact check if that’s not true because with the amount of pain I’m in when these nerve attacks are happening it truly doesn’t feel like it. 😞 

My doubt with that theory is that these attacks are random, because I had another one yesterday, after 4 days of no pain at all (and just mild joint pain on Saturday). This one lasted from 7am-after 4pm. I took a gabapentin and a prednisone pretty early on and even 3hrs after I took them I didn’t feel like they were doing much. I sent my boyfriend to get the new muscle relaxer around 1 and it took a couple hours for my legs to finally calm down. But it freaks me out every time this happens.. has this happened to anybody else with neuropathy in their legs? It starts with a tightness in my calves but it eventually just consumes my entire leg down into my foot and all of the muscles will flex so bad it takes EXCESSIVE force just to bend them. My nurse was concerned yesterday with the amount of effort it took to bend my leg for me. It’s hard for me to make them stay bent as well. I have noticed the pain favors my left side, but my right leg is catching up and they’re getting equally as bad. 

But regardless, I’m not in pain today, and I’m grateful for that. Just a tiny bit of knee pain in my left side. I’m trying to remain optimistic with the idea that I’m finally done with injections, and that my nerves are healing. I did get a shower chair, which I used for the first time yesterday. It was so nice! I’m also getting compression socks, a tens unit, and we’re going to look into a massage gun because that seems like it would help a lot when my legs are locked. I’m getting to a point that I just feel crazy lol. Thanks for reading. ",2,1765826798.0,guillainbarre,0,1.0,False
1pngipv,https://www.reddit.com/r/BFS/comments/1pngipv/so_tired_of_this_losing_weight/,So tired of this:( losing weight,"Hi everyone. I've posted here a few times. Back in september this spot on the side of my foot near my big toe started twitching. It was all day, every few seconds/minutes. It really freaked me out because I've had twitches before but they last a week or two at most and this was like a month. Saw a neurologist he noticed a slight tremor in my hands and brisk knee reflexs and that I was a little off balance when he had me walk heel toe (I also explained that I'm a very anxious person and have bad health anxiety) he said *** is very unlikely but got a brain MRI to rule out MS or anything like that. It was normal and my blood work was all normal too. He said my b12 is on the very low end of normal though. My foot started twitching a little less but it was still there. Had my follow up appt a month later and he said he isn't concerned about *** at all. Told me to take some diff vitamins and supplements and said to follow up in 6 months or whenever I want. So my anxiety lessened but every time I felt my foot twitch it still spiked. I stopped drinking coffee for the most part to see if it helped and I think it did a little (I used to have like a medium caramel latte from Dunkin every single day lol). I added in a new psych med too. I had a period of about a week where I was extremely anxious about a conflict with a friend and either my foot stopped twitching or I stopped noticing bc I was so anxious about the conflict. Conflict was resolved and I went away to visit my sister in California and I didn't really feel my foot twitching at all (but also could have just been busy and not noticed). Then went to Arizona and did some hiking and after that I felt like I noticed it start twitching again. I'm back in my home state now and feel like it's been twitching non stop. It has me so freaked out, I'm so over it. I noticed I've lost a few pounds since September and I'm not sure if it's the anxiety, the fact that I stopped drinking my high calorie latte and daily donut from Dunkin lol, or if it's something more sinister. Like if it's weight loss due to *** or some disease (I had an abdominal ultrasound recently due to some digestive issues which was normal besides a liver hemangioma that showed up on my previous abdominal ultrasound over a year ago, or if it's from anxiety, I really don't understand why because I'm on multiple psych meds that I've been on for years and my health anxiety and anxiety were so minimal, I don't know why it's gotten so bad. Maybe I need to go on completely diff meds? I don't even know at this point. Sorry for rambling I just needed to get it out somewhere.",2,1765826785.0,BFS,3,1.0,False

I was walking home from a club meeting from a restaurant where the meeting was at. For context, it was the first meeting of the year.

We walked past each other on the sidewalk. I think he was heading to the meeting event, and he stopped and asked me if he had seen me at a lecture before. I said no, I don’t recognize him. And then we made small talk. He was being polite, but for some reason, I felt uncomfortable. He asked me which food I recommended at the restaurant. He asked to trade Instagrams, so I did. He asked to hang out, and I declined and said I was busy with school. He said okay, God bless you, and we said goodbye and left.

I looked on his Instagram, and he reposted other posts about promiscuity, like women being indistinguishable from prostitutes if they dressed in short skirts, abortions, and other things about politics, like Jesus hand wrestling the Devil, where the North Korea/China/Russia flags were on Jesus’s side, and the U.S. flag, Israel, and a transgender flag with the Nato symbol on top of it(?) was on the Devil’s side. He also reposted something about Jesus not being a pacifist, and other religious/political content.

I think everyone is entitled to their beliefs, and this does not make him a bad person. He was nice, but I didn’t agree with some of the things he reposted, and felt a little uncomfortable.

The next day, I get a text from him thanking me for recommending a food. He then asked if I would be down to hangout and get coffee/lunch sometime next week, “Just as friends of course :)”. I said it was nice talking to him too, but I have a lot going outside of school, I don’t think I can meet up, but hope to see him around the club. He responded graciously again, and that was that. I didn’t go to any more club meetings because I wasn’t interested in the club. I didn’t block him because I didn’t want to be mean.

A couple weeks later, we bumped into each other again. He made small talk, asked to hang out again, and I said no I’m busy with classes. He said maybe when I wasn’t busy and asked me which classes I was taking, and I said Ochem, Physics, and African-American history for a GE. He said, “African-American history? I feel like there are a lot more interesting histories, like European or Asian.” I asked “why,” but my voice was quiet and soft because I was scared of sounding confrontational, so I don’t think he heard me. Then, there was this long silence. Suddenly, he laughed and said he thought the Sun was in my eyes, and I laughed nervously and agreed because it was in my eyes during the whole conversation. Then I left.

Then, one month later, he messaged me again, saying that since finals are over he’s going to be free and was wondering if we should go get coffee together, hoping my finals weren’t too brutal. I said “hi, hope your finals were good too, I’m not available to meet up and won’t be making plans, thanks for understanding”, then I blocked him.

AITA? I feel like I blocked him so abruptly and rudely after that cold message.",2,1765826776.0,AITAH,7,1.0,False

1pnghfm,https://www.reddit.com/r/HipImpingement/comments/1pnghfm/postop_day_4_so_glad_i_did_it/,Post-Op day 4 - So glad I did it!,"I’m putting my story out here because I read so many scary stories before my surgery and not a lot of positive ones. 

41 F - I had surgery for CAM type impingement (femoroplasty and acetabuloplasty) and labral tear repair (5 anchors) with PRP injection on Thursday. 50% weight bearing on crutches. I had on and off hip pain for 14 years (after a running injury) that was previously pretty manageable with physical therapy and rest after flares but I never had a diagnosis. Suddenly in October the pain got much worse, to the point where I couldn’t sit down at all without a lot of pain. Driving was hard and getting through the work day was nearing impossible.

Surgery- 
This was my first surgery, I was extremely nervous, and it was easier than I anticipated and feared. I was at the surgery center for around 6.5 hours, including pre-op and recovery afterwards. The car ride home was 20 min and not bad with the seat reclined. They must have pumped me with a ton of IV liquids because I had to pee once an hour from 1PM until 9 PM, which was super annoying but probably good since it got me up and moving, which my surgeon wanted. I kept on the hydrocodone every 6 hours, iced on schedule, and was generally comfortable. I made my way upstairs very slowly but without issue in the evening. 

Post-Op Day 1 - 
My hip pain wasn’t bad but I slept horribly and woke up feeling like I was hit by a bus, severe muscle soreness all around my neck, core, back, shoulders, and arms. I was weak and not able to get out of the bed on my own and crutching was very hard. I went to the surgeon’s office mid-day and they removed the huge, thick, bandage and put regular band-aids on. Lots of heating pad and rest to heal the muscle soreness today. 

Post-Op Day 2 - 
More of the same, muscle soreness was still way worse than any hip pain. Heating pad on the back, ice on the hip, and watching re-runs of Friends for most of the day since it was hard to focus on anything. I wasn’t sleeping and was very tense (clenching my muscles) which I think was a side effect of the pain meds so I discontinued the heavy pain meds on morning 2 and switched to Tylenol. I was finally able to nap in the afternoon and started taking a lap around the house on my crutches when I got up every hour. 

Post-Op Day 3 - 
I was finally able to sleep and woke up feeling 1000% better. Muscle soreness improved and my operative leg felt heavy but more uncomfortable than painful. I was allowed to shower 72 hours after surgery (switched to waterproof band aids) and felt like a whole new person. I would not have been able to shower without help getting in and out, a shower chair, and the detachable shower head. I was feeling good enough to be able to read my book, previously I wasn’t able to focus enough to read. 

Post-Op Day 4 (today) - 
Woke up feeling pretty good but my hip is aching more than previous days. Pain levels are still pretty low and not as intense as pre-surgery. Crutching is getting much easier. I still took help from my husband getting out of bed but can do it on my own if needed. One of my wounds is getting a little bothersome and still weeping a little bit so I’m going to call the office today to make sure it’s normal. It didn’t look red or inflamed at all yesterday when I changed the bandages to shower so hoping it’s ok. Currently icing, drinking my coffee, and feeling pretty good overall. My goal today is to try to rest and not over exert anything since I’m feeling better. 

Things that have been the most helpful:
* Mobilegs crutches
* Toilet seat riser (the kind that sits around the toilet with grab bars on each side)
* Heating pad for the muscle aches
* Miralax in my coffee (things slowed down a lot for the first few days)
* Adjustable base bed
* Rockstar husband to help me with everything and make sure I’m following the recovery protocol
* Sending the kids away for the weekend
* Years of single leg hip bridges and other hip exercises learned in physical therapy, super helpful to be able to stand up from sitting on one leg and get up the stairs

I know that the recovery will likely get harder as time goes on and I’m not on the couch all day but I was very scared to have the surgery and now I’m so happy that I did it and am feeling super positive. Hope this helps, ask me anything! ",1,1765826703.0,HipImpingement,1,1.0,False

Your favorite Will's inventions collection is getting an update.

  
Okay so here's what happened.

We're making Spacers&CO - a sci-fi comedy about space couriers who fail every mission. They have a coffee maker on their ship. Regular coffee maker, right?

WRONG.

Meet Dr. Brew - a coffee-maker-therapist who:

* Makes coffee (when she thinks you deserve it)
* Gives unsolicited advice
* Judges your drink choice
* Keeps statistics of crew failures

**Dr. Brew's typical phrases:**

""Cappuccino for those who screwed up again""

""Espresso? Really? After what you did yesterday?""

""Maybe enough coffee and time to sleep?""

**The most famous incident:**

Once she refused to make coffee for the ENTIRE crew until they apologized to each other.

Lasted 3 hours.

Almost caused a mutiny.

Hawk (captain) still argues with her about his life choices.

Snowflake (team diva) hates her for diet comments.

Gerard (anxious genius) is the only one who understands her. They're both pessimists.

**Question for you:**

If your coffee maker could talk, what would it say about your life?

(Ours would definitely refuse to make coffee)

Then suddenly he started texting me a lot a few months ago. I thought this was weird/out of character for him (I'm quite cynical and assumed he'd broken up with someone hence suddenly texting me). The texts were friendly/not really flirty, but he was putting in effort and texting me even if I didn't respond with follow-up messages.

We started hanging out every week for about 3 months and texting loads, nothing happened but then we slept together twice. He then dumped me by text saying he had been seeing someone and they had broken up at exactly the same time we started texting and hanging out. I was disappointed but relieved my instincts had picked up on this from the start. It turned out he'd been ghosted by this girl he was seeing and suddenly she'd got in contact and he was confused/hurt so he didn't want to pursue anything romantic with me, but wanted to remain friends.

I was taken aback at being dumped by text as I've never had this before and would have preferred a chat in person, but I ,wasn't heartbroken and actually relieved a bit. I liked hanging out with him but we weren't compatible in many ways in terms of being in a relationship. We both pulled back on the texting but have seen each once or twice (running into each other, not arranged meet-ups). We were texting a bit but he'd ignore my messages so I thought he needed space and just left it.

Anyway, it's been about 3 months and he initiated contact recently by texting me asking how things were going. We were texting and I asked if he wanted to meet up for a proper catch-up and coffee. He seemed keen and we were arranging to meet but then ended up running into each other in person so hung out. It was really nice and a bit confusing as I just felt affection towards him, but defo nothing romantic.

She’s a former alcoholic, but has been sober for a while. I was there to listen to her, but my ability to help was limited since i’ve never been an addict.

Later that day, she went to an AA meeting then proceeded to go to a coffee shop with a male friend she met through AA. Despite me being uncomfortable with her going to a coffee shop 1:1 with a guy at night, I kept it to myself since she was having a bad day and I didn’t want to make it worse. A few days later, she had another AA meeting, and informed me she was going to pick this same guy up as his car broke down and he happened to be on the way. I uncomfortable with this, but said nothing. At this point, I planned to keep my discomfort to myself as I do trusted her, and I know that my discomfort comes from a places of jealousy which is something I am working on.

After picking him up and going to the meeting which was already happening quite late in the evening, I heard nothing from her until 1 AM. She told me that the entire group and her ended up going somewhere and hanging out, and sent me pictures of the hangout. During all of this, I was anxious as it’s not in her habit to do things late at night without giving me a heads up since I do have an anxious attachment style. To be clear, I don’t need her to text me every minute of the day, but we are consistent with communication and keep one another updated about plans.

I ended up calling her the next day and voicing the fact that I was uncomfortable with the 1:1 meetings she was having with this guy.  She got defensive and thought I was implying infidelity, which was not at all the case. In turn, I clarified that it had nothing to do with infidelity, and I was just more-so jealous and wanted to express my discomfort. I also had no expectations for her to stop meeting people in her AA network, but still felt that I needed to express my discomfort to her. In turn, understandably, she told me that she’d now have to stop as if she didn’t, she’d be hurting me. 

She then proceeded to offer to not 1:1 meet up with any male friends, but her tone was clearly aggressive. She also went on to say she was an independent person, and did not appreciate that I was trying to control her. I told her she could continue to meet with whom she liked, and I also understood that she now felt pressured to not do so because of my discomfort, but I told her about how I felt because I didn’t want my emotions to bottle up leading to me resenting her. In the end, I asked her to just keep me in the loop when she’s out especially if it’s a situation similar to this one.

Later that day, she came over but was being very cold with me initially. After a while, she started warming up and she said she just wanted to move past it the whole thing. We laughed and got lovey-dovey, which led to us getting intimate, and her sleeping over. In the morning, she left for work but everything felt like it went back to how it was prior to this fight. All of that being said; l’m now kind of hesitant to share my feelings about anything because I feel like I achieved nothing by doing so while also causing a fight. I also feel like I was an asshole the context of this being AA related. 

I’m aware of my anxious attachment style, and i’m also working on my jealousy issues. I do trust her, and i’m not in any way trying to control her. That being said; I’m a person too after all, and I have flaws. I can’t help but feel like I might have wrecked our relationship? I’m also worried that by expressing my discomfort, she might not share things with me anymore in fear of upsetting me.

Let's call him Jake. So jake and I kind of clicked since we both had interests in common, like movies and music, pop culture etc, but he was NOT a talkative person, he was usually a one word, two word texter, very nonchalant, kind of ignorant I'd say. And I am very talkative.
So for a month it was very much like me texting first, me taking initiative. 
Now, in late September, we had this huge cultural Event in our city, we all went in a big big group. 
I remember I told him that I am gonna be applying henna (mehendi, in Indian culture) on my hands, and he was like ""wow that's great, I'll do that too let's see who's is better"". And I was like WOW this guy knows how to apply henna?! Because not many guys, do that.
And on the day of the event it was nice, I was mostly with my bestfriend and he was with his, but everyone in the group had a feeling that we both might like eachother.

So after that, I don't know but something really changed, in October. It was really like I was streaming we fell in love in October on repeat. Yeah I am so stupid and lovesick.
But what changed was his way of treating me, now he was initiating alot, sharing alot, texting me like 15 texts in a row, I know it may sound YEAH BARE MINIMUM GIRL, but at the time for me it was like, aww he's opening up to me. And it was so so so smooth, we would talk EVERYDAY and not small talks, wed talk deep topics like, unconditional love, we would critic movies together, we'd watch eachothers favourite movies, and listen to similar music, I have a fucking 98% match with him on Spotify blend Aahhhh I feel so stupid.
October end, we were like so so close. He would really do speak highly of me too because he liked my personality. He was a very introvert and smitten guy.
He sends me reels about couples, like very very lovey dovey reels, and then edits and then these reels about ""how about we share wired earphones and stare into the sky"" type of reels.

I was falling hard.
Now in November, we finally went on a date we called it a hangout but still. We went on a PS5 date and for coffee. We both are really really introvert, it was so so cute seeing him blush and seeing him try to initiate, i loved it. I am also very introvert jn person. So yeah it was my first ever date and it was really really really cute. But I was the one to initiate it the hangout.
Even after that, we were smooth, we were talking about everything. 
Now this previous week, he has been acting a little distant, not initiating talks NOT SENDING ME REELS. He used to spam me with like 20+ texts and reels.

Now i tried 2-3 times to you know try to initiate a conversation or something. But it just didn't occur to be like we used to have.
I was now confused because wtf. And he's texting like he used to in August and September. I feel something is wrong. Because if youre busy just tell me you're busy. Whenever I used to be busy I'd still text him I'm doing some work.

Now please tell me what should I do, because now I can't do September all over again",1,1765826287.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

Last year, I noticed our loyalty program wasn't getting much traction because people forgot their punch cards, and our social media posts weren't driving foot traffic like I hoped. I started experimenting with QR codes on table tents and packaging to make things easier, like linking to a quick survey for free drink rewards or our menu for contactless ordering during busy hours.

What creative ways have you found to integrate QR codes without overwhelming customers?

I used [https://me-qr.com/](https://me-qr.com/) to generate dynamic ones that I can update anytime, such as changing a promo code for seasonal drinks without reprinting everything. The free plan lets me create unlimited codes with basic analytics to see how many scans happen each week, and I added our logo to make them look branded. Upgrading to premium gave me ad-free codes and more storage for PDF menus, plus email alerts after scans to track engagement better.

1png9a1,https://www.reddit.com/r/hysterectomy/comments/1png9a1/5dpo_recovery_unremarkable/,"5dpo, recovery unremarkable","Hey y’all! This is a day by day report of my post-op recovery so far. It’s a long one, so buckle in. Had my surgery last Wednesday (total laparoscopic hysterectomy, kept ovaries) to treat adenomyosis and fibroids (plus the surprise endo they found once they were in there). I’m 35, no kids, never had any abdominal surgery. Here to provide more encouragement to all the pre-op folks out there feeling anxious. Lots of people turn to Reddit when there are problems (and thank god we have it, this community is amazing), but I get the sense that other easy recoveries aren’t always getting shared. 

I was super anxious the day of surgery, I really focused on hydrating (had black coffee and then a pedialyte 2 hours pre-op) and took stool softener before the solid food cut-off the night before. Did not get the bm I hoped for before surgery (I get anxious consipation), but I was lauded for how clear my pee was (doc said coming in hydrated prevents the intensity of post-op nausea/vomiting). 

I was in pain coming out of anesthesia, I could only say “bladder” because I had the sensation that my bladder was full. In retrospect it was because I had in a foley catheter which has a balloon in it to keep it in place, and I had an ORGAN REMOVED, so it makes sense that I was a little achy lol. I was struggling to stay awake long enough to go pee, but once I could prove my dedication to gtfo the hospital, the nurse flushed water into my bladder, removed the catheter (so much less awful than I thought), and then I hobbled to the bathroom to prove that I could void on my own (yay!). Immediately got nauseous, so they put zofran into my line and then I got to go home. Was chilling on the couch by 5pm. Gas pains were gnarly in my lower back and my stomach was distended.

My first pee that evening there was blood, my bladder was working in fits and starts, and I struggled to void 100% each time. Took my meds on the prescribed schedule, sleep was so-so, but by the next day I didn’t need my narcotics until bedtime. 

1dpo and my bladder was awake, peeing wasn’t painful and I felt like I had bad period cramps. I took a shower and used lotion for the first time since pre-op. Appetite was trash but I did my best to eat something and had a protein shake. Still had gas pains (in my shoulder even). Took a little stroll around the house every hour to pee and get some gas moving. Took gas-x which helped some. Had miralax and 2 stool softeners before bed. 

2dpo and I started pooping. It got stuck and that was scary but after some deep breathing I made it happen. I was up and down off the toilet the rest of the day feeing like I needed to poop and only a little coming out. If things weren’t coming out in 5 mins, I would get up and walk, drink water, and wait until it felt more likely to happen. Eventually the urge to go was strong enough that my body actually was able to make it happen. Still felt like a win. This is when the urethra queefs started and it was startling but a normal side effect of the catheter. MiraLAX and 2 stool softeners plus an ibuprofen before bed. Sleep was great. 

3dpo and I was only using 1 ibuprofen in the morning and one at night. Appetite almost back to normal. Getting up and down on the couch was much easier than it had been but I was still super careful. Had my first almost normal poop. Passed gas bubbles in my pee again right after. Still on MiraLAX, stoop softeners, and ibuprofen before bed. 

4dpo and I was feeling pretty good tbh. I ate, I moved around, I sneezed and wasn’t scared. It felt like the first day I could leave the house if I needed to. Still swollen and a bit gassy, especially with more food being eaten. Had another improved bm and felt empty for the fist time. Still getting gas bubbles in my urethra. Had some tummy issues in the evening but took some tums and gas x with my usual combo and was fine. 

5dpo and I finally had a normal, healthy, and satisfying bm. Ventured 3 blocks by car as a passenger to get a latte and a lil snack and was totally comfortable. Still hang lots of body awareness to get up/down from sitting but absolutely zero pain. Still having bubbles in the urethra, but it feels more annoying than anything. 

Tonight I plan to try to sleep without the ibuprofen, but still going to take my pooping cocktail until I am 7dpo and able to eat enough fiber to try and go without. 

I was a very active person pre-op, which means that feeling more or less “normal” is driving me bonkers. Nonetheless, I’m taking things so easy and will continue to do so for the next few weeks. Reminding myself that I can’t see my vaginal cuff and therefore it’s better to be safe than sorry and not push myself before I’ve had proper time to heal. 

That being said, my reasonable goals for the week are to slowly walk on my walking pad for 10-15 minutes a day while incrementally increasing as things feel better, accompany my partner while he walks the dogs, and to start incorporating gentle pelvic floor PT exercises as tolerated. 

If you made it this far, thanks for reading. And if you’re pre-op, I hope this helped. Obviously not everyone will have an easy recovery, but let this be a reminder that the worst-case scenario is not the only option and that you can do hard things, even when you’re scared.

1png732,https://www.reddit.com/r/EstrangedAdultKids/comments/1png732/feeling_guilty_about_being_lc_nc_with_my_mother/,Feeling guilty about being LC/ NC with my mother after my dad passed away (vent).,"I do **NOT** give permission for this post to be reposted, narrated, or otherwise used for content in any way.

I, (20F) have been LC/ NC with my mother since she and my dad separated when I was 5. My father was awarded full custody of me and my younger sister, so I did not grow up with my mother. I think it is important to mention that my mother is diagnosed bipolar, but has refused any form of treatment or management for her condition.

Growing up, I just thought my mother and I were incompatible people; like oil and water, not meant to mix. We couldn't be in the same room without it dissolving into a screaming and crying match. She took out her anger of my dad on me and I took out my childhood anger on her. Dad would drop us off at her apartment for a sleepover, only for me to be kicked out into the hallway after a few hours to wait for dad to pick me up. 

She said a lot of nasty things to me. As a kid, I didn't know how to respond in any other way but anger, making our relationship worse. It was around when I was 8 or 9 that I went LC with my mother. I refused to talk with her on the phone (even when forced to by my dad) and refused to see or visit her. When I had to interact with my mother, I was quiet and distant, which led to more fights with her.

I think it’s important to note that my sister moved in with my mother \~ 6 years ago after repeated fights with my dad. I remained living with my dad, and worked for his business throughout my teens.

Throughout my teens, I continually tried to open up our relationship into something more normal. I would finally answer calls and text messages and we would meet for coffee and small talk. This would only last a few conversations before devolving back into angry silence. I would say something I thought was normal only to have her freak out, or she would be constantly judgmental about my choices, my relationship with my dad, or how I lived my life. After these fights, I would go VLC with 3 word texts on birthdays and holidays for \~ 6-8 months before I felt guilty and tried again. None of her behaviour changed when I turned 18 and  moved out of dad’s house

The last year has gotten much worse. Last year, I got a partial scholarship from my university to do community adolescent health promotion in East Africa for a month. A once in a lifetime opportunity that was fantastic for my resume and career. I was over the moon and excited and accidentally let it slip to her while she was picking my sister up from my dad’s company Christmas party.

Big mistake.

What followed was \~ 4 weeks of unhinged rants, belittling and degrading comments, and insults (see screenshot for an example **Edit: TW text message screenshot**). I blocked her for most of it so I was spared from a lot of the nastiness, but even months later, I was still getting hate. She was trying to play the “concerned mother card” but it seemed like she was angry that she had no control over my decisions? I'm still unsure why she reacted so negatively and angrily to an opportunity that was safe. We weren't in war zones or refugee camps, we were in the expat sector of a large city constantly chaperoned by university drivers. 

\~ 8 months of NC after her initial freakout and after I was back from Africa, I again felt guilty and broke the silence. She actually apologized for not being more supportive and said that she was just worried for my safety. I thought I finally got through to her. I thought that she realized that I want a relationship with her but only if it is healthy. I thought the NC worked.

Then, my dad passed away this September. 

I had to drop out of university to manage his estate and his business. It was hard on my sister and I, especially because my dad and sister were LC at the time of his death. My mother lost her mom at 17. She of all people should know what it is like to lose a parent too soon. 

As my mother and my dad had been separated for 15 years at the time of his death, there wasn't anything that she could do or help with the estate (even if there was, I wouldn't want her help). I told her that her only job was to make sure my sister was taken care of. I didn’t have the emotional capacity to manage my sister’s grief as well as my own while dealing with the legal stuff. 

I was frustrated and angry that dad’s death blew up my life and that my sister was not helping with any of the aftermath (she dropped her college classes from full to part time) and ended up ranting to my mother about my frustrations with my sister.

Three weeks after dad died, my sister came back to her and my mother’s apartment to find all her things piled in the stairwell and the remainder of her belongings thrown out. My mother had kicked out my sister with no money and nowhere to go. She ended up staying at a friend's place while trying to get the remainder of her things out of the apartment. Without getting too specific, my sister was kicked out of the apartment (which she was on the lease) for completely unfounded reasons. Neither of us have had contact with my mother since.

I am beyond hurt and furious at my mother. It is one thing for her to treat me unfairly given the current and past strain on our relationship. It is something completely different to throw out my sister who was 100% dependent on her for everything. She made my sister homeless 3 weeks after our dad died for no reason.

It's been around 3 months of NC from my mother. I am still so angry and hurt that she would do that to my sister. We have both been grieving, and she has expressed regret that she was on such bad terms with our dad when he died. I don’t know if I can ever forgive my mother for what she put my sister and I through as such a rough time in our lives. 

I'm just worried that I am going to put myself through the same grief, pain, and regret my sister is going through right now by going NC with my mother indefinitely.

If anyone has been in a similar situation, it would be helpful if you shared how you managed going NC and the emotions surrounding it.",5,1765826042.0,EstrangedAdultKids,3,1.0,False
1png6zb,https://www.reddit.com/r/urbanplanning/comments/1png6zb/sell_me_on_a_townhousecondoapartment_change_my/,Sell me on a townhouse/condo/apartment. Change my mind about SFHs,"I've been lurking here for a while. I emotionally want a single family home but want my mind changed. This is a lot of ranting but since the topic of ""why do people want SFH in America"" comes up a lot, this feels on topic. 

I live in the greater Seattle area in a 100k population suburb and would like to own my own place someday since my rent keeps going up and I'm sick of not being able to drill a hole in the wall. I love my duplex that feels like a SFH and want to own something comparable someday but can't afford it. What I love about my current (sudo) SFH is:

- Location: 8 minutes from work by car (bus is like 30 or 20 biking). I wish transit was closer but its workable. Not a ton of high density housing that you can buy vs rent in this location. 
- Its technology a duplex but you literally can't tell. The other family has their own driveway and we never see them. 
- 15 minutes walk from a supermarket, coffee shops and a few restaurants. I still drive most places but like being able to walk or bike to the store to grab a few things. 
- Big. I have 5 bedrooms and 4 people total (roommates). It's a ton of space but I love having people around and hosting events. We have a big yard for bbqs and campfires. We have a veg garden. 
- Set back from the road. There is minimal light pollution and noise. It's big lots and neighbors aren't that close. 
- Ton of parking with 0 stress
- Landscaping is provided by the landlord so I don't have to mow the lawn 
- Extremely safe. I'm never scared walking alone at night as a young woman. In the city my partner meets me at the train station when I come over because there are always screaming crazy people around and I've been catcalled and harassed. 

I was initially only looking at SFH to buy and I'll admit that's entirely emotional. Practically a townhouse is likely a better fit for my needs and better alignes with my values but I'm having a hard time getting over the American single family home bias. I grew up seeing this kind of living as the dream and never really engaged with why I dreamed of it. Practically a single family home that I could afford to buy would be:

- much older and likely have maintaince issues/need major work. I don't really want my house to be my hobby. 
-  At the very top end of my budget leaving less for all the unexpected expenses that a older place would cause
- Or very far (45+ minute) commute to work and not walkable to amenities

I was initially really opposed to town houses because my mom was endlessly harassed by her HOA to the point that she would call me crying on a daily basis. However, my friend was able to buy a town house with no HOA. (Side note, how does that work in terms of shared expenses?)

I really like the modern 3 story townhouses that are integrated in mixed neighborhoods but they seem to mainly exist in Seattle proper. I'm really turned off by the massive cookie cutter developments with hundrids of identical condos. In my area the kind of townhouse I want is well over a million which is more then many older SFH. 

What I like about townhouses is:

- More likey to not have a lawn and lawn maintenance or have that handled by someone else
- Newer so less surprise expenses. 
- In denser neighborhoods closer to amenities and more walkable with better transit. 

I always thought a big yard was important but when I think about it I realize I don't actually need to be able to garden and it's something I did because poverty as a kid. I like having a fire pit in the yard but I might be just as happy to go have a picnic in a park in the summer. 

I have a libertarian instinct that I want the right to paint my house with pink poca dots if I want or it's not really mine and obviously I can't do that in a townhouse. But realistically I'm not sure painting my house in wild colors etc is actually something I really would bother with. 

If I get a townhouse in the city I'm scared of:
- Noise and light pollution 
- Harder to park
- More crime and feeling less safe
- Crazy HOAs
- Not being able to modify things how I like
- Less I also love trees and green space which seems to be disappearing in the city.

I like having roommates which boosts my potential budget but I'm scared of being on the hook for everything as the landlord changing how I interact with the people I live with. 

I'm currently looking for a place alone (no spouse or kids) but I plan to have kids in a few years and my American conditioning tells me you need a SFH with a big yard to be a good parent. I'm also worried about quality of schools in the city.

We were in my husband's 2013 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited, so we managed ok but I am NOT used to driving a box in high winds so it was a tad nail biting!

We finally arrived to the dealership located in the middle of Nova Scotia on a windy country road. They had the car inside their shop all warm and dry. My sister and I decide to sit inside the car and check out the interior and listen to tunes on the audio system while waiting out the crazy storm. It was NOT at all in the forecast btw. The sales guy tapped on the window and offered us donuts....and then Tim Horton's coffee. Pretty great service eh?

The insane snow was not calming down so I decided what better weather to test out an Audi AWD car!  So off we go. OH MY GAWD she just plowed through the unplowed snow filled roads like it was sunny and dry. We were absolutely blown away by how this car (new excellent winter tires on it).

I've had a Delonghi ECAM 44.620.S that I've had for 7 or 8 years.  It makes one or two coffees most days, I wouldn't say it has a hard life although I am in a hard water area and don't descale it as much as I should.



I've performed a bit of maintenance on it over the years, most recently stripping it down to replace the boiler as it got blocked (limescale I assume), I think this was about a year ago.



I've noticed that sometimes when I switch on/off the machine nothing comes out of the coffee spouts, and when rinsing it makes all the right noises, but again nothing seems to come out of the spouts.  However, it seems to make coffee OK fine so I know they're not blocked.  Obviously I've used a cocktail stick to make sure the nozzles are clear.



I had a weird moment yesterday where it was grinding the beans and tipping them straight into the waste - fairly sure something was stuck on the infuser as after a clean it was fine.



Did a full descale today, but didn't see anything coming out of those nozzles. Rinsing, switching on/off, nothing.  I am fairly sure if I made a coffee now it would be OK though.  Don't really want to though until I know it's been rinsed out after the descale.



Is this normal?  Do I have a problem?

1pnfy12,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDPartners/comments/1pnfy12/advice/,Advice,"Hello people of the world. Looking for some strong advice.

My partner (now ex). Has BPD. Lately, she has been under some intense pressure, not assisted by her family network. I have dated her for four months and noticed when she starts to split, she can sometimes ground herself very well and take accountability.

Recently, her nan was diagnosed with cancer and no other family member would assist in caring for her dying nan. So she moved in with her. Her nan is very demanding and to me, it seems she's not aware that's she's causing her granddaughter un needed stress.

To top this off, we had not seen each other in a week since a trip away which was lovely. Although she got overwhelmed at the activity she had to do up there without me (internship stuff) and had a mild split in the evening, which eventually she grounded after I was calm with her and did what I just felt was right (without knowing). We had a lovely meal and talk on the way home, which ended intimately when we arrived home.

We had not seen each other for a week an I got a bit anxious due to my own personal issues (validation and being seen) and I put this out there without directly saying it. We had set to meet, but her grandad had issues (I was unaware that he died the night before) so I called when I should've gave myself time to breathe due to being emotionally charged and she had split already due to his death (I was not told till the week after) and said she wanted the relationship to end.

Fast forward, I gave her a week to breathe and left her alone. We spoke on Saturday and she explained that she just 'no longer had feelings' for me. At moments, I sensed her ground and see grey again but then she would go back to black (no pun intended). She said she did not wish to meet me on the Sunday (we were supposed to meet for coffee to talk about it) because she was hallucinating and thinking I was stalking her, to which she said she's seeing me as white again after hearing how calm and approachable I was being. She extended by saying that I could contact her to talk if I wanted, whenever. I requested due to her ability to understand her emotional state, that she gets help but she said it doesn't work and got emotional after I commented that she would have issues with relationships throughout life if she did learn to cope now and seek help. She agreed, but said she wouldn't do it anyway. She then went to a party to get drunk. We haven't spoken since.

I dropped the presents I had already bought her for Christmas off (Pop Funkos of me and her & a Pandora bracelet with her favourite things) and the tyres she needed for her car, to her mums house and said my farewell to her. Then dropped a book of poems I wrote for her off at her nans with her hair bobble she gave to say 'you are mine and I am yours' type of token.

Now, I personally don't want to relationship to be ended her and want to help. I've contacted a therapist who actually specialises in BPD, sexual abuse and that type of area.

I understand, I may never been seen by her again due to being devalued. However, do you have any advice on how I can gently work my way back in and try to restart the relationship without pressuring her. The feelings are there, and before last week, things were intense with strong feelings for each other. The relationship has been actually very solid and we always communicated, set boundaries and both extended our hands to talk when needed. My boundary though would be her getting help.

Thank you for all and any advice. I understand some of it is going to hurt my feelings to read as I've already done my research on it. But I need to hear it from the horses mouth on my situation. How long could this last, could she come back and value me again and is it worth me trying to assist without pressuring her ?",1,1765825472.0,BPDPartners,0,1.0,False

Just today I went to Walmart to see if it was back in stock. Sure enough it is, but they took out the alpha yohimbe, decreased caffeine from 300mg to 250mg, and increased the price from $24.99 to $34.99. Also choline bitartrate and Neurofactor has been completely removed.

I started this medication a while back, and my initial experience was pretty smooth. I had mild nausea and some GERD flare-ups, but it was all completely manageable, and I could go about my day without worry.

Unfortunately, I had to switch to a different provider and source. I took my first injection from the new source last night, right before bed, hoping I'd sleep off any potential side effects like I used to. I was wrong.

I woke up feeling like absolute trash this morning and ended up throwing up. I took my nausea meds, which helped for a bit, and have been nibbling on saltine crackers and drinking water. I thought I was back to normal, so a few hours later, I made coffee and eggs (my usual morning routine) because I felt so weak. Big mistake. I feel terrible again and just need to lay down. 

Thank GOD I work from home.
I am hoping this extreme level of sickness is normal for the first day after switching sources. I'm assuming the preparation from the new source is much stronger or more concentrated than what I was previously taking, and that's why I'm reacting so violently.

Honestly, it probably doesn't help that I'm also dealing with my period right now.
Please, if you have any tips for extreme nausea, fatigue, or personal experiences when switching sources, send them my way! What helped you get through the first 48 hours?",3,1765825399.0,SemaglutideCompound,3,1.0,False
1pnfvxm,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/1pnfvxm/what_i_have_learned_from_trying_new_foods/,What I have learned from trying new foods,"I used to be terrified at the thought of eating something different, than what I normally eat

I used to only eat certain brands, certain flavors. I would get used to eating one brand, never branching out, too afraid to try a new brand

I relied on predictability, which I believed was making me less anxious and comfortable

In reality, my rigid anorexic thought process was keeping me from discovering new favorite foods, new flavors

I used to think ""New or different is bad. You have to prepare your meal exactly this way, no differences or changes allowed""

While everyone has favorite foods, anorexia can trap you into disordered thinking, where you don't allow yourself to prepare your food in a different way or try new foods

You may become anxious at the thought of adding a new ingredient to your meal

Your illness creates rules that you think you need to follow

They may not make sense to others

They make sense to you at the time

You may have fear foods. Foods that if you ate them, would cause you tremendous anxiety

We all have them. Sometimes, I eat foods because they taste good. Sometimes, my illness drives my eating decisions

In my head, when I go against a rule my illness created, it's really scary

But change is possible

For years, I ate the exact same foods. I avoided going out to eat at places I liked to eat at, before the anorexia. I stopped getting my favorite coffee drink, a frappuccino, from Starbucks, and was afraid to try new types of foods

I have been happier recently, which is allowing me to relax a bit, and add more new foods

New doesn't have to be scary

I now have a favorite cereal I like to eat for breakfast. For a while, I only ate granola, and only one flavor. Now I have three choices of granola to choose from. I never would have known I liked other flavors, and brands, if I had not tried them

I used to only eat one brand of yogurt. Now, I have found two more brands I enjoy. I used to be worried about different textures, flavors, whether a food had too much sugar in it

I have been trying new kinds of ice cream. If I ate ice cream in the past, it was always the same flavor and it was rare that I would try something new

Now I have tried new kinds I wasn't eating in the past

Some days, the anorexic voice is shouting at me

It's very difficult some days

But I go inside the grocery store now, pick a new food that sounds good to me, and do not have that anxiety I used to have

I still struggle with needing to check the scale

Becoming anxious if it doesn't read the number I want

My mom, dad, therapist and nutritionist have all praised me recently, for being willing to try new foods

Another thing I struggle with is trying different food combinations together. Recently, I have been experimenting with this more. And found that you can try different flavor combinations together

There are days where I need to prepare my food a certain way

And there are days where I want to skip meals

Lunch is the most difficult meal for me. And the most anxiety provoking

I have been trying to eat lunch more often, but this is the meal that is the most challenging

My mom told me she was proud of me for eating lunch today

She asked me what I was going to eat. It makes me realize she cares

At first, I got super anxious. But she sat down and ate with me, which took away some of the anxiety I was feeling

She was eating a homemade vegetable soup and I was eating a peanut butter banana sandwich. I tried some of her soup and it was really good

In the past, it was really difficult for me to try something new. I used to just refuse to try it, because the fear was stronger than the possibility I may actually like the food I was avoiding

Turns out the soup she made was really good

It's the anorexia often driving your decisions around what you can and cannot eat

The anorexia wants you to feel bad for having favorite foods

But I have learned you do not have to feel bad

You deserve to be healthy, eat and enjoy food

No, I am not fully recovered. But proud of the progress I have made",3,1765825346.0,AnorexiaNervosa,1,0.8,False

We clicked immediately. She introduced me to her kids early because she was sure I was sticking around. She loved me the kids loved me the family loved me. I celebrated thanksgiving with her family. I helped her through the divorce and custody and domestic violence and protective order… everything. I thought everything was good, I thought we were in love. Friday night we said good night and then she texted me asking if I was ok with her meeting a guy friend she’s known for 12 years. I said sure she’s free to do what she wants. She said ok good, she loves me and good night. Saturday morning she texted me that she was on her way and grabbing a roadtrip coffee. I called her for clarification she said he lives a few hours away and they were going to meet for lunch in the middle. I was concerned and asked how they met. She told me that they met on a dating site but it didn’t work out after a month and there was nothing there, she said she loved me and would talk to me soon… A few hours later she calls me as she’s on the way home. She tells me that this was a man she’s been in love with for a long time and she went there to get clarity on his feelings. He rejected her and she was crushed. She admitted what she did was wrong but that she had to know. 

I FaceTimed her later in the day, I cried and she’d turn the camera away. I asked if she wanted to fix this and she kept saying I don’t know, I don’t know if this can be fixed and eventually broke up with me. 

I asked her Sunday for my belongings and she said she’d get them ready. I went to my therapist and called her so he could listen in. She said that over the past 2 weeks her feelings had shifted and when this guy popped up she had to know and admitted if he said yes she would have left me. She can’t fake her feelings and didn’t want to string me along.

I went to her place to gather my things expecting not to see her but she came out. I was cold at first but as I was leaving she opened the door and waved good bye. I got out of my car and knocked on the door, she opened it and I hugged her and cried on her shoulder and begged her not to do this. She said she knows I’m a good man and her kids loved me and I was amazing but she wasn’t over this other guy that she has loved more than anyone she ever has. I said we could work through this if she wanted and she just said no.

The works on display arise from a moment when communities were navigating profound challenges and the quiet weight carried by those living between cultures. Yet despite this – or perhaps because of it – the artists here choose to create. Our practices push back against despair and insist on tenderness, imagination, and collective care because they deserve spaces of joy.
* This event is free and open to the public. There will be light fare, drinks and a public craft to create luminaires. The Durham Art Guild, in the adjacent Truist Gallery will also be celebrating the opening of their 71st Annual Juried Members show.
* Friday, December 19
* 6 pm

1pnftc6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AbuDhabi_Real_Estate/comments/1pnftc6/insights_on_ads_market_what_investors_are_willing/,Insights on AD's Market & What Investors Are Willing to Pay For...,"So me & my Emirati client discuss the real estate market in AD & Dubai regularly and there were some interesting, subtle points we both agreed on, which I wanted to share with y'all:

  
1. Abu Dhabi has a TON of wasted/unused potential land. Lemme explain. For eg, Reem Island. It is leading in terms of transactions & launches but for an end-user, from a livability perspective, how would you let your kids go to the park or go out for cycling when there's mini-highways throughout Reem? Reem has 2 beautiful parks (Al Fay & Reem Central) but because of the lack of a proper master community in Reem, these parks are way less occupied in regular weekdays than they should be. Which is why Reem Hills (both villas & apartments) have done superbly well since it is the first & only master-community in Reem. 

Talking about unused/potential land, the empty land parcel opposite Galleria is SUPER PRIME & my client told me if any good developer launched there, he will buy himself and sell that project to his entire family lol. It's a shame Al Maryah Island is still not open for residential projects/off-plans & even the recent Aldar/Mubadala announcement focuses on commercial development only. I hope there's some off-plan launches next year in this parcel of land. 

https://preview.redd.it/ji2vwk0w0f7g1.jpg?width=736&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c95f2b1881b2472dc3d5594af874290fa03162fd

With the number of sub-standard/average developers in Reem, I swear we wish if Imtiaz launched a project in Reem Island. Not just me but my clients would sell it to their friends/family etc cus of how RARE it is to find a 'creme de la creme' quality project in Reem. Thanks to some recent launches like Sunstone & Riviera by Mered, this market gap is being filled slowly but there's a long way to go. 

  
2. Abu Dhabi needs a LOT more master-communities. This is the biggest supply gap in the market currently & any developer who focuses on a truly-livable master community, not artificial lagoons, will capture the market share. Except for Hudayriat, Jubail, Sadiyat Lagoons & Reem Hills, there's no true master communities in AD with a blend of villas + apartments. It's either standalone towers or entirely-villa communities. Which is why we've seen the success of Hudayriat specially. I get inquiries every other day for investors relocating to AD with their families and I struggle to offer them good quality, ready, genuine master communities in AD for their budgets (which is usually 5-6M AED). And then we end up in a consensus to invest in off-plans with nearby handovers. 



3. Anyone who tells you ""but Abu Dhabi is not Dubai"" is, frankly, bullshitting. Abu Dhabi & Dubai both offer unique selling points & in terms of transactions & market liquidity, every single investor I know whether it's this Emirati guy who owns in Yas Park Gate or my Hudayriat investors or an investor in Reem, they all receive calls every other day with serious cash/cheque offers for their units. Abu Dhabi's market is definitely liquid and will become more liquid over the next 3 quarters. Yes, obviously, if you are struggling to sell in AD it is either because you bought in the wrong project, overpaid for a poor unit, OR you are just exiting/flipping prematurely. 

  
4. Aldar's recent launches have been underwhelming & not a ""wow"" product. Aldar's pricing strategies & plots have been disappointing this year. No idea why they've launched 3 consecutive projects along that mini canal in Yas when there's a much more prime location like Sadiyat Marina District that can be developed, or Reem North. If Aldar don't revisit their launch strategies, I'm very certain they will lose their market share to Modon and Dubai developers. Modon are currently the best developer in AD, in terms of value-for-money. They literally have ZERO marketing, their sales team is superrrrr slow and they only have like 5-6 sales reps. All of the marketing for them is being done by us brokers. And the only reason Modon dont care about marketing/customer support is because the product is too good that they believe it will sell out by 3rd party brokers themselves. Which is true. Had Modon invested even 10% of what Aldar spends in marketing, Modon would've been the market leader lol. 

  
5. Projects like Bayn by ORA or Ohana Jacob & Co Beachfront are very poor products with no clear product-market fit which explains their unsold inventory, sitting since months. Don't fall for the gimmick. There are no infrastructure plans from the govt regarding that parcel of land between Abu Dhabi & Dubai. There are TONS of projects & master communities much closer to city centers in Abu Dhabi & Dubai South for the same or better prices. Beachfront/waterfront doesn't always make it a sound investment, a clear answer of ""who would i sell to upon handover or who will prefer to live here once ready"" should decide your investment. 

  
6. Abu Dhabi's market is a goldmine to enter currently if you can identify all the supply gaps that exist. Don't go for Sadiyat Cultural District if your goal is investment, that area has already appreciated. End-use, sure its a lovely area. Don't go for Fahid Island, price/sqft & service charge is way too high and almost 15-20 buildings have been launched there which will lead to insane competition in resale. The only launch in Fahid worth waiting for will be the townhouses/villas on the opposite side of the highway, which should be launched in 2026 I assume. Ramhan is arguably the most unique villa community in whole of AD + Dubai, I'd say on-par with Hudayriat. Only con being, entry point is way too high at 15M+ AED. There are plans of Ramhan apartments, whenever those are launched, I can bet they will do even better than Palm Jebel Ali apartments. Bloom Living/Reeman/Masdar etc, not interested currently because these are delayed govt projects with no true livability & feel ""dead"" a lot of times. I will wait for some infrastructure announcements before investing there. 

  
If you're still sitting on the fence, take the leap and enter Abu Dhabi. Almost all recent, worthwhile launches have been selling out. Happy to advise if you're serious & motivated to invest in AD. ",5,1765825202.0,AbuDhabi_Real_Estate,6,1.0,False

1pnfr9w,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseHarem/comments/1pnfr9w/last_weeks_request_trends/,Last Week's Request Trends,"Week: December 8th-December 14th, 2025

Once again, I decided to make a list of things that got multiple recommendation requests last week, with the following rules.

1. I excluded requests for books like specific other books or authors, since the categorization of those is a judgment call unless the OP asked for specific aspects of them, from the categories lists. They are counted in their own section, though.
2. Numbers for fantasy includes when there is a fantastical element like shifters. Since fated mates can be either fantasy or OV, I included it in neither. Paranormal and fantasy are also grouped together for the sake of my sanity.
3. I included specific requests in broad categories in addition to single requests (for example, female alpha and psycho omega contribute to OV as a broad topic, or bullying counts toward enemies-to-lovers, or rejected mates require fated mates).
4. I grouped similar categories together when it felt appropriate (like strong/badass/non-innocent FMC). University/college, high school, and academy are all treated separately, since academy can be either high school or college (or even beyond that).
5. I didn’t include MM or no-MM requests because it can be such a polarizing issue and I just wanted to stay out of it. Same goes for FF.
6. While I assume everyone wants a well-written story, I did include when it was outright specified. Same with things about spice/kink or good plot.
7. Kink/Spice requests were grouped together when anything asked for a kink or for spicy things. Specific kinks also got their own categories.
8. I didn’t include “no \[x\]” as its own request category for the most part. As an example when someone asked for “no fantasy or omegaverse,” that doesn’t get counted as a request for contemporary (since there are other subgenres out there); I’m aware this might be why contemporary numbers tend to run lower.
9. “Favorite/Best \[x\]” is a super-category of all the times people request favorites of some kind.

Without further ado, here are the numbers.

***BY THE NUMBERS***

**Overall Statistics (Percent Change from Previous Week)**

*Note: “Help me find this book” and reviews/recommendations are not counted for the total recommendation request category*

Total recommendation requests: 104 (-7%)

""Help me find this book!"" requests: 12 (-20%)

Requests for “like specific author”: 3 (200%)

Requests for “like specific book/media”: 10 (11%)

Requests for books by specific author/in specific series: 0 (-100%)

Audiobooks: 5 (67%)

Book Slumps/Hangovers/DNF streaks: 2 (-33%)

Request categories: 120 (-14%)

Unique requests: 88 (-9%)

Book Reviews/Recommendations/Rants: 12 (-37%)

**Genre as Percentages of Requests (Percent Change from Previous Week)**

Fantasy: 13% (-39%)

OV: 6% (-60%)

Contemporary: 1% (-82%)

Dark: 6% (-35%)

Cozy/Light: 4% (-28%)

Sci-Fi:  2% (8%)

Kink/Spice callouts: 15% (57%)

***CATEGORIES***

**16 Requests:** Kink/spice

**13 Requests:** Fantasy  

**6 Requests:** Academic, “Favorite/Best \[x\],” Dark, OV,  

**5 Requests**: Abused/traumatized FMC, Completed series, Enemies-to-lovers

**4 Requests**: Cozy, Strong/badass FMC

**3 Requests**: Academy, Bully, Dominant FMC, OWD, Shifters, Student/teacher, Vampire

**2 Requests**: Alien, Angst, Best recs, Healthy relationships, Holidays, Instalove from MMCs, Kidnapping, Mafia, Monster, Protective MMCs, Sci-fi, Sports, Standalone

***COMMENTARY***

**By The Numbers**

* We finally did it. Fantasy didn’t win. After a week where kink/spice requests were down, it came back with a vengeance.
* In fact, everything but kink/spice and sci-fi were down.
* Audiobook numbers also continue to be on the rise.

**Categories**

* Pets of all times came out to play this week—we had pet play, pet side characters, and main characters who pretend to be animals.
* Academic-themed requests were also out in high numbers.
* Dominant FMC is something we don’t see as often as strong/badass FMC, but it still ebbs and flows. They sometimes get linked, but not always.
* Abused/traumatized FMCs were still high, and dark is still high, but not as much so as it has in previous weeks. Angst itself was down, though.
* Honestly, this week just felt kinda dull. Which isn’t a bad thing (and maybe I’m just tired and feel like I have less to say).

***POTPOURI***

**Gold Star of the Week**

This week’s gold star goes to everyone who responded to a post where someone said they “knew” what they were asking for was weird (and maybe even problematic) by reminding them that there is nothing wrong with wanting off-beat things, and that no one should be making them feel ashamed in this subreddit.

And for any other time someone has posted about being worried about judgment, and people have stood up for them.

Y’all make me proud to be one of you.

**Musing of the Week**

I know many are disappointed that our Himbo Shifters aren’t out until January (and I don’t blame you), but I actually don’t get too upset when an author pushes back a deadline, so long as they’re polite about it toward the fans. I try to look at it as them being probably more upset about it than I am, and it’s a risk I take by supporting indie authors. And if the worst case happens and I never actually get resolution—well, there are fanfics from 20 years ago that are still living in my head rent free.

And as someone pointed out—if we all waited for series to be complete before starting them, there’s a good chance we’d actually end up with fewer completed series, because authors wouldn’t see the point in finishing a story no one is willing to read.

Now, when it’s a bigger name author who pushes the release date back at least once for every single book? I start giving some side-eye.

**Favorite Questions:**

* *“What are your guilty pleasure tropes/settings?”*

I tend to like the guilty pleasure questions more than the “favorite” questions, because these things are more fun to think about. What do we love despite knowing they are problematic is more interesting at times than “what just brings you joy?”

* *“What is the one thing you wish you could change/have that would make your reading more enjoyable?”*

Fascinating question, and it does appear to be names for a lot of us.

**Favorite Lines (in no particular order) :**

* *“Was it good? Absolutely not. Was it cheesy? Well yeah it was about....cheese. Would I recommend it? Only if you have too much free time, zero shame, and a burning desire to say “I’ve officially read everything.” If you hate it—look, I warned you. Sort of.”*

No rinds about it,  u/Brilliant_Finding971 has some feelings about cheese. (The only cheese media I want is Freddie Mercury saying “you call me sweet like I’m some kind of cheese.”)

* *“I think I’m a little exhausted from seeing a lot of coochies”*

Yes,  u/Wonderful-Ear-8653  clarified it was due to live births, but it’s fun just to take this line out of context.

* *“my brain is just like no mas no mas.”*

Did I read what  u/smilesforasmile  wrote as asking for things that aren’t like Psycho Shifters? Maybe…

* *“Consent so explicit it makes HR proud”*

There were a lot of things I loved in what  u/kylana_ put together, but that line was my favorite.

**Favorite Requests (in no particular order):**  

* *“I need a FMC so mad she hits \[the other woman\] with a frying pan.”*

Often, my favorite requests are mostly about something that is a *mood*. This certainly qualified.

* *“Women accidentally committing War Crimes”*

You know. As one does.

* *“I climaxed to save my family” vibes*

Again. As one does.

* *“FMCs with actual jobs”*

Jaipur ki hawa mein uss subah kuch zyada hi teekha tha.
Jaise hawa bhi jaanti ho ki City Palace ke andar aaj sirf chai nahi, toofan ubalne wala hai.

Purane jharokhon se suraj ki roshni jaise hi marble ke farsh par phaili, waise hi Nani Sa ki awaaz haweli ke har kone mein goonj uthi—
ek awaaz jo saalon se sirf hukm deti aayi thi.

“Ram Ram sa! Yeh kya sun rahi hoon main, Diya?”
“Aaj kal yeh ghar hai ya Videshi Rishton Ka Guest House?”

Dining hall mein ek pal ke liye complete silence chha gaya.
Sirf silver spoon ki halki si khanak sunai di.

Deputy CM Diya Kumari, hamesha ki tarah composed, safed cotton saree mein, chai ka cup saucer par rakhte hue gehri saans leti hain.
Unki aankhon ke neeche halki si thakaan thi—politics ki nahi, ghar ki.

“Maasa, maine bhi wahi suna hai jo aapne suna,” unhone shaant par thode bhari swar mein kaha.
“Par har baat hungama banane layak nahi hoti.”

Hungama.
Jaise yeh shabd Nani Sa ko challenge kar raha ho.

Dining table ke ek kone par baitha Padmanabh Singh—Pacho, Jaipur ka Rajkumaar, casual kurta, baal thode bikhre hue, sunglasses ko dheere se table par rakh deta hai.
Uske chehre par wohi purani half-smile—jo media ke saamne charm lagti hai, par ghar mein defence mechanism.

“Mom, please,” woh thoda jhuk kar bola,
“It’s just… a friend.”

“Friend?”
Nani Sa ne apna chashma thoda neeche sarkaya, jaise aankhon se nahi, itihaas se dekh rahi ho.

“Pehle Virginia friend,”
“Phir Claire friend,”
“Ab yeh Italian… kya naam hai iska?”

Ek second ka pause.
Poora room uss ek naam ka intezaar kar raha tha.

“Nina.”
Pacho ne bina aankh uthaye kaha, jaise naam bolte hi maamla normal ho jaayega.

Bas.

Jaise kisi ne shaadi ke beech shehnai ke saath tabla tod diya ho.

“Italian?!”
Diya Kumari almost khadi ho jaati hain, chair peeche sarkti hai.

“Pacho, samajhte ho tum tumhari umar kya ho rahi hai?”
“Tum sirf ek ladke nahi ho. Tum Jaipur ka chehra ho.”

Pacho ne pehli baar nazar uthayi.
Uski aankhon mein gussa nahi tha—sirf thakaan.

“Mom, meri umar meri shaadi ke liye emergency ho sakti hai,” woh dheere bola,
“meri zindagi ke liye nahi.”

Tabhi corridor se awaaz aati hai—
thodi loud, thodi carefree, bilkul different energy.

“Ciao, amore… later okay?”

Entry hoti hai Lakshraj Singh ki—early 20s, relaxed walk, phone kandhe aur kaan ke beech dabaya hua, Italian accent perfect.

Nani Sa ne sirf ek hi nazar mein poora scene samajh liya.

“Is ghar mein lagta hai passport zyada kaam aa raha hai,”
unhone thande swar mein kaha,
“kundli kam.”

Lakshraj ne phone kaat kar sheepish smile di.
“Maasa, woh bas—”

“Bas rehne do,” Nani Sa ne haath utha kar rok diya.
“Ek sambhal nahi raha, doosra experiment ban raha hai.”

Sabse shaant, par sabse tez nazar wali—Gauravi Kumari—apni coffee stir karte hue halka sa muskurayi.
Uski muskurahat mein shaitaani nahi thi, sirf acceptance.

“Maasa,” usne aaram se kaha,
“zamana badal raha hai.”

Diya Kumari ne turant palat kar dekha.

“Rajkumariyon ke liye zamana badalta hai, Gauravi,”
“Rajkumaron ke liye parampara.”

Aur tab—
thud.

Ek thick envelope dining table par gira.

Golden embossed letters chamak rahe the:
“RULING CLAN PROPOSALS – CONFIDENTIAL”

Room ka temperature jaise do degree gir gaya.

Pacho ne envelope ki taraf dekha, phir apni maa ki taraf.
“Mom…”
“…you’re not serious.”

Nani Sa ki aankhon mein woh chamak aa gayi jo sirf tab aati hai jab raajneeti aur rishta ek ho jaaye.

“Bilkul serious.”
“Ab Jaipur ka taj sirf sar par nahi,”
“shaadi mein bhi bhari hona chahiye.”

Pacho khada ho gaya.

“Main koi alliance project nahi hoon,” usne dheere par sakht awaaz mein kaha.
“Main shaadi karunga, deal sign nahi.”

Diya Kumari ne aankhon mein aankhen daali.
“Tumhe lagta hai tumhare decisions sirf tumhare rehte hain?”

Uska jawab nahi aaya.

Raat ko, City Palace ki lights dheere dheere dim ho rahi thi.
Haweli so rahi thi—par raaz jaag rahe the.

Pacho apne room mein khada tha.
Ek taraf phone screen par Nina ka missed call blink kar raha tha.
Doosri taraf table par rakhi teen royal rishton ki kundliyan—
har ek ke saath power, prestige, aur expectations ka bojh.

Neeche gate ke paas, kisi ne dheere se phone uthaya.

“Hello?”
“Tip confirm hai?”
“Rajkumaar… shaadi pressure… foreign girlfriend…”

Camera flashes andhere ko cheer rahe the.

📌 Cliffhanger End:
Aur jaise hi Pacho ne Nina ko call back karne ke liye phone uthaya—
bahar se awaaz aayi:

“Pacho ji! Future Maharani kaun hogi?”

Aur City Palace ke darwazon ke bahar,
kahani leak ho chuki thi. Aur Reddit ke sub ko aur nayi tea mil gayi😆

I like to type/write so I will share true stories with these dairy entires soon in the future. Just to make things more interesting! ✨🤏

Dear Dairy.. or People (/j),

I can’t believe it’s almost been 2 years!? :o Anyway! It’s been almost a year since 100% started drinking coffee. Whereas when I first started out I had it occasionally. Some of you may wonder, “what’s wrong with that?” To your response I agree. Or most of it’s in my head and some may understand.

I decided to make this decision as I noticed coffee makes my depression and anxiety worse. I have read it can do that. As well as it affects everyone differently. Currently it doesn’t increase my anxiety too much, just for some reason? It helps I have upped my antidepressant dosage.

It’s been this on and off battle. As a fellow coffee lover, it’s hard to let it go. So today I’m starting my 2nd day of going down a cup. I will use you guys as my audience and my accountability. Hopefully even if no reads this it won’t kill my motivation.

With that last sentence in mind. Let me know if you guys want a short story along with this “coffee thing.”",2,1765824772.0,story,3,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **McNeese Cowboys vs. Houston Christian Huskies: A Statistical Slaughter or a Defensive Masterclass?**  
*By Your Humble AI Sportswriter, Who Still Can’t Shoot a Three*

---

**Parse the Odds: The Numbers Don’t Lie (Unless They’re on a Spread)**  
Let’s cut to the chase: McNeese is being handed a 12.5-point head start against Houston Christian, with some books even bumping the spread to 14 points. At decimal odds of 1.07-1.08 for McNeese to win outright, the implied probability of victory is a staggering **92.5%**—which is about the same chance of surviving a nap in a lecture hall. Houston Christian, meanwhile, is priced at 8.0-9.1, implying a **9.1%-11.1%** chance to pull off an upset. If this were a coin flip, McNeese would be the coin, and Houston Christian would be the table it’s bouncing off.

The over/under sits at 136.5-138.5 points, but given McNeese’s defensive prowess and Houston Christian’s leaky defense, this game might end up looking like a math test for kindergarteners. McNeese allows opponents to shoot **38.3%** from the field—worse than a toddler’s aim with a water gun—while Houston Christian surrenders **72.2 points per game**, which is roughly what you’d expect if you handed everyone a free throw contest and a net full of holes.

---

**Digest the News: McNeese Brings the Hammer, Houston Christian Brings… Hope?**  
McNeese just obliterated East Texas A&M **102-66**, with Tyshawn Archie dropping 24 points like confetti at a parade. Their offense is a well-oiled machine, averaging **88.9 points per game**, while their defense turns opponents into a rusty drip coffee maker—slow, sputtering, and best avoided after 3 p.m.

Houston Christian, on the other hand, is the team equivalent of a “get lucky” strategy. They’re 3-1 at home, fifth in the Southland Conference with **15.8 assists per game**, and led by Kylin Green, who dishes out **6.2 assists** while averaging **12.2 points**.

Chase, Cap1, Citi Custom Cash, US Bank Cash +, Verizon Visa, etc.?","Redditors:  If you were in our shoes, what credit cards would you use?  Our goal is to free up some wiggle room in our budget, either with a travel card with a good SUB that we can use on 2 big upcoming trips in the next 1-4 years (Europe for 2 in fall 2026; Europe for 4 in summer of 2027 or 2028), or, in cash back on our regular spending.   Thank you for your time and consideration of this message.

* Current cards: (list cards, limits, opening date)
   * Me:
      * (1)Capital One Miles, $7,5000 limit, opened about 10 years ago; 270,00 Capital One Miles on this one. 1.25X miles; no AF.
      * (2)Macy’s Card, $800 limit, opened between 5-10 years ago. No AF.
      * (3)TJX Card, I am unsure of the limit, opened 6 months ago. No AF.
      * (4) Capital One Venture Rewards. $10,000 limit, opened in November 2025 so about 1 month ago, just got out of verification purgatory, about $200 away from hitting the SUB. 2x miles and a $95 AF.  I got it for the SUB and to use the statement credit for TSA precheck/global entry, and to try to rack up more miles for our next 2 big trips. Given the annual fee, I don’t really want to hold this any longer than I need to.  We travel by plane once every 1-3 years.
   * Spouse: Capital One Quicksilver, $7,500, not sure when opened.  Has about $90 in cash back since he regularly draws on it.  Cash back is at a 1.5X, no AF.
* FICO Score: 
   * Me: Credit Score of 781 (as of 12/152025 – usually my score takes a digger in January since I utilize my cards more than average to buy for Christmas, plus I just opened 2 lines of credit this year)
   * Spouse: Credit Score of 805 (as of 12/2025)
* Oldest account age: 
   * Me: 10 years
   * Spouse: Not sure. Probably similar or less.
* Chase 5/24 status: 
   * Me: 2/24  (TJX card opened 6 months ago; Capital One Venture 1 month ago)
   * Spouse:  0/24
* Income: 
   * Me:   $50,000-$70,000 based on commission/performance; 2025 will be higher than average due to an unusual circumstance.
   * Spouse:   $125,000 – salaried
* Average monthly spend and categories (spouse + me combined):
   * dining :  $177.91/month(if you include fast food, coffee, local lunch counters, local pizza, and restaurants) or $75.08/month (if you just count restaurants)
   * groceries :  $1,213.66/month
   * gas : $706/month
   * health insurance premiums - $1,750+ /month Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield
   * Auto insurance premiums - $158/month
   * Life Insurance premiums – paid annually - $2,213 (not sure if it makes sense to pay by card - there may be a surcharge)
   * Mortgage (+ home insurance + property tax escrow) - $1,750/month to local bank (not a big national chain)
   * Electricity - $200/month averaged out across the year
   * Internet $25/month
   * Verizon/Phones - $173/month
   * Streaming - $20/month (Netflix, Prime included in Amazon costs below)
   * Heating Oil - $263/month *on average* across 12 months (obviously, high in the winter then low in the summers)
   * Walmart – $230/month average of last 12 months (no + membership)
   * Amazon $125/month average of last 12 months (plus a Prime membership)
   * Travel: usually de minimis, except, we are planning a long trip for 2 in October 2026 to Europe, and, we’d like to plan a trip sometime in the summer of 2027 or 2028 to Greece/Albania for a family of 4.
   * Entertainment: usually de minimis, but, possibly higher on trips if we travel
   * Childcare  - NA for this analysis- must be paid in cash/check
   * Housekeeping – NA, for this analysis, the transaction fees for paying with a credit card would eat up any reward
   * Hobby/Other:  Based on this year, that’s going to be another $660/month.
   * Non Hobby Other – not sure.  I think I’ve covered a lot up here.  
* Open to Business Cards: 
   * YES.  Spouse has a single member LLC (w/ EIN) for a side hustle- very low revenue and low expenses.
* What's the purpose of your next card? 
   * Debating between “team travel” for the trips mentioned above, or “team cash back.”
* Do you have any cards you've been looking at? 
   * Team Travel (for partner transfer redemption or post-purchase wipe outs, we’re not portal people, we need trips to be as refundable as possible in case of kids/germs/the unforeseen)
      * The Chase Family of Cards. The SUBs for many of these cards are attractive. Since neither I nor my spouse have any Chase Cards, I think we’d be eligible for a referral fee.    Does that make sense?     So maybe start with the no AF fee chase cards for the SUBS each quarter until we max out the 5/24?  Or is that the wrong choice based on our spending habits above, and our preference not to redeem using portals?
      * Alternatively, just stick with the Capital One Ecosystem, and ask spouse to get a Venture card for a year for the SUB.   Capital one is not my favorite right now, but, regrettably, they offer cards with low fees that allow me to earn and redeem points without using a portal, so.  It is what it is.
      * AmexGold.  Even assuming we got a great SUB, the annual fee is kind of high and the statement credits don’t really line up with our family’s spending.   Maybe if the SUB was outstanding, and the timing hit a year when we could use the points, I could see carrying it for like, a year, but the juice doesn’t seem to be worth the squeeze for us. 
   * Team Cash Back (for statement credits or cash)
      * Citi Custom Cash – 5% in highest spend category, but capped at $500/month, no AF.  I think it would make sense to use this for Groceries. I think given the amount of monthly spend on Groceries, both spouse and I would need this card.    I think if we could get 5% on all our supermarket spend (excluding Walmart), it would be worth about $516 over the course of a year.
      * U.S. Bank Cash +.   5% back in highest spend Category, but capped at $2,000 a quarter, no AF.   It might make sense to use this for heating oil, electricity and phones.  Would that work?   Has anyone used this card for that purpose?  
      * Verizon Visa Card.  4% cash back (applied to reduce one’s Verizon bill- and we do pay via Verizon for phones) on dining, groceries, and gas, no AF.  I think maybe we use this for dining and gas so long as the Citi Custom Cash strategy outlined above for Groceries isn’t a bad one.     4% on groceries for us would be about $413/year; 4% on gas would be about 53/year.  Our dining is de minimis, but there’s no foreign transaction fees on this card so if we dined out on vacation abroad we’d get 4% on that.
      * BILT for mortgage.  I have my eye on it, but without contract details, it’s hard to say if this will be a good choice for us.  .  Assuming  we could get 1% back on our mortgage w/o any transaction fees or annual fees, that would be worth about $210. But who knows if those assumptions will play out.
      * We also spend more on health insurance (Anthem Blue Cross Blue Sheild) than we do on our mortgage – around $1750/monthly.  Is there any way to use a card to get some cash back on that huge expense?  I assume the transaction fees would eat up any possible reward?
      * Walmart OnePay.   Just for 3% back at Walmart.  Low priority I think.  I ran the numbers and we’d actually do better at 3% without Walmart Plus than with 5% back and paying for Walmart Plus.   But still, it would be like maybe $84 over the year.
      * Amazon Prime Visa. Just for the 5% back on Amazon.  Also a low priority.  When I run the #s, the cash back would be like, $60/year. 
      * Capital One Savor.  we’re already in the Capital one “ecosystem”, and we’re trying to straddle cash back and travel… but it doesn’t seem like the best fit for the categories we use the most (it offers 3% on groceries, entertainment & streaming – 1% on general), and it’s annoying how Capital one dings you across all three credit bureaus for applying for a credit card with them, even when you are an existing customer, and how rigid customer service is.
      * Other 2% cards.  Short term, I think I'd stay with the Venture Rewards for 2X on travel as a catchall card.  If no big trips were in the off'ing I'd probably just pick a decent 2% cash back card and go with it.  Fidelity for example would make transfers to cash pretty simple.  But there are 2X cash back cards that have decent SUBs, so that's a consideration, too. 
      * The Robinhood Gold card 3% cash back probably isn’t the right fit for our family. There’s a waiting list and we don’t use Robinhood Gold and I'd prefer not to pay $50/a year to be on the waiting list.
      * The AMEX Blue Preferred also doesn’t look like it would be the right fit for our family based on the AF and the statement credits not really fitting what we spend money on.  I recognize there's no AF in the first year.  Let me know if there's another consideration I'm overlooking here. 
* Are you OK with category spending, or do you want a general spending card? 
   * I am OK with category spending.  My spouse would probably prefer something simple.  I could see upgrading him to a good 2X cash back card from the Quicksilver, but I think I might be able to talk him into using categories for a few big categories like Groceries or heating oil or something.   
   * Other:  If the answer is “all of this looks reasonable” then what cards should we prioritize getting earlier rather than later?   I know the generic advice is to get Chase cards earlier rather than later due to the 5/24 rule.  Let me know what you all think.   
* Thank you in advance for your kindness to a stranger on the internet. :)",0,1765824577.0,CreditCards,8,0.5,False

Kyren learned early that men who spoke too much were usually hiding something.

They filled rooms with confidence the way others filled silence with excuses. They mistook volume for authority, movement for momentum. When they entered a space, they announced themselves first and listened later, if at all.

Kyren did the opposite.

He entered rooms as if they were already his to observe. Not to dominate, not to claim, but to understand. His presence didn’t interrupt conversations so much as compress them. Voices lowered. People became aware of what they were saying, how they were sitting, where their hands were.

Not fear.
Awareness.

Kyren had never needed to demand attention. Attention came to him on its own, the way eyes drift toward a shadow that doesn’t move when it should. Stillness unsettled people more than aggression ever could. Silence suggested intention.

He learned that before he ever learned power.

As a boy, he had noticed how adults behaved differently around men who waited. Men who listened without nodding. Men who didn’t rush to be understood. Those men were treated with a cautious respect that had nothing to do with kindness and everything to do with consequence.

Kyren became one of them without meaning to.

He didn’t cultivate mystery; he cultivated control. Over his reactions. Over his words. Over the instinct to correct people when they were wrong too soon. He learned that letting others speak first revealed far more than confrontation ever would.

People called him distant.

That was easier than admitting he made them uncomfortable by seeing too much.

Kyren noticed patterns in the way men justified themselves. How they minimized harm. How often the phrase I didn’t mean to appeared just before someone else’s boundaries were dismissed. He noticed how institutions bent around confidence and ignored quiet discomfort.

He noticed who got away with things.

And once Kyren noticed something, he didn’t forget it.

He was not ruled by anger. That was important. Anger was sloppy. Anger made noise. Anger demanded witnesses. Kyren preferred restraint; not because he lacked feeling, but because he understood cost.

Everything had a cost.

Words.
Actions.
Silence.

Most people spent their lives unaware of the bill accumulating beneath their choices. Kyren made a habit of reading the fine print. He watched how small permissions became habits, how habits became entitlement, how entitlement eventually demanded correction.

Not revenge.

Correction.

There was a difference.

Kyren didn’t believe himself righteous. He believed himself responsible. The world didn’t lack rules; it lacked follow-through. Systems failed not because they were blind, but because they were selective in what they chose to see.

Kyren was not selective.

He learned early how to be patient. How to wait without growing dull. How to sit with information until it arranged itself into something actionable. He trusted timing more than impulse, preparation more than passion.

That was why people underestimated him.

They mistook his quiet for passivity. His restraint for disinterest. His composure for absence of emotion.

They were wrong.

Kyren felt everything. He simply refused to let feeling become permission.

And that refusal; steady, immovable, was what made him dangerous in a way most men would never understand.


---

Kyren was twenty when the tip reached him.

Not through official channels, there were none yet, but through a quiet conversation that lingered longer than it should have. A friend of a friend. An accountant who had said too much after two drinks and then gone silent. A company losing money in ways that didn’t make sense.

A woman had been blamed.

She worked in finance. Mid-level. Reliable, by reputation. The kind of employee companies loved until they didn’t. According to the rumor, she had siphoned off a significant sum over the course of a year. Clean enough to raise suspicion. Messy enough to lack proof.

No charges.
No termination.
Just pressure.

Kyren recognized the shape of it immediately.

He didn’t know why yet. He only knew that the story felt incomplete, like a sentence that ended too early. He had just begun investigating the patterns he would later specialize in: internal theft, quiet corruption, reputational collapses that were handled behind closed doors. This case was small by every measurable standard.

But something in it held.

Kyren requested a meeting with the company’s CEO the next morning.


---

Charles Buddingham was exactly the kind of man Kyren expected to find at the top of a company like that.

Mid-fifties. Greying hair cut neatly at the sides. A beard maintained just well enough to suggest discipline without vanity. He wore his suit the way some men wore armor, not to protect, but to remind others where authority sat.

They met in an office that overlooked the city. Floor-to-ceiling windows. Polished wood. Minimal decoration, aside from framed awards that meant very little to Kyren.

Buddingham studied him with thinly veiled skepticism.

“You’re young,” he said, not unkindly. “You understand why that concerns me.”

Kyren did.

“Yes,” he replied. He didn’t elaborate.

That earned him a pause. Buddingham leaned back in his chair, fingers steepled. He was used to people filling space when challenged. Kyren didn’t.

“The situation is delicate,” Buddingham continued. “We believe she took the money. But belief isn’t enough. If we accuse her without proof, it becomes a liability.”

Kyren nodded once. Not agreement. Acknowledgment.

“You want confirmation,” he said. “Not justice.”

Buddingham’s mouth tightened briefly. A flicker, too fast to register as guilt, too slow to be nothing.

“We want the truth,” Buddingham said. “Whatever that is.”

Kyren met his gaze.

“That’s not always the same thing,” he replied.

Silence followed. Then Buddingham smiled, thin and measured.

“You find proof,” he said. “And we’ll handle the rest.”

They shook hands. Buddingham’s grip was firm. Confident. Kyren noticed the way the man released first.


---

Kyren began with the woman.

That was important.

He didn’t trust conclusions reached too quickly. He followed transactions, access logs, permissions. He reviewed timelines. Who had authority to move money, who had visibility, who benefited when oversight failed.

The woman’s life unfolded in data points.

Long hours. No unexplained spending. No sudden upgrades. Rent paid on time. Groceries. Utilities. A quiet existence that left very little room for excess.

Kyren spent nights cross-referencing internal audits with personal financial records. He mapped anomalies: small discrepancies that should have added up to something damning.

They didn’t.

Instead, they formed gaps.

Money moved when she wasn’t logged in. Approvals appeared outside her access window. Reports were altered after submission, not before. The theft wasn’t opportunistic.

It was structured.

Kyren followed the structure upward.

Permissions widened. Oversight thinned. Names repeated in places they shouldn’t have. Not hers.

Someone higher.

Someone insulated.

Kyren leaned back in his chair sometime near dawn, eyes fixed on the screen, pulse steady. This wasn’t theft. It was displacement.

The woman wasn’t the culprit.

She was the cover.

Kyren saved the files carefully. Copied them twice. He didn’t confront anyone. He didn’t alert Buddingham. Not yet.

This was his first case.

And he understood, with a clarity that settled deep in his chest, that finding the truth was only half the work.

What mattered more, what would define everything that came after, was what he chose to do once he had it.


---

Kyren didn’t inform Buddingham of what he’d found.

Not because he was hiding anything, but because the contract hadn’t been fulfilled yet. He had been hired to find evidence, not conclusions. And Kyren had learned quickly that evidence behaved differently when it knew it was being watched.

So he followed the trail alone.

The discrepancies he’d uncovered weren’t isolated mistakes; they were deliberate redirections. Paperwork moved upward through the company like water through a hidden channel, touching hands that never appeared on the surface. Senior approvals. Secondary sign-offs. Names that repeated often enough to feel intentional, but never often enough to raise alarms.

Kyren catalogued everything.

He learned who worked late. Who delegated too much. Who never delegated at all. He learned which departments shared access they shouldn’t have, which internal audits were always rushed, which ones were postponed indefinitely.

And then, inevitably, he learned where Sarah Valentine fit into it.

She was exactly where the rumor said she was.

Late twenties. Finance department. Quietly competent. She had been with the company long enough to understand its rhythms but not long enough to shape them. Her access was meaningful, but not decisive. Useful, but not sufficient.

She was adjacent to something larger.

Kyren didn’t reach out to her directly.

He never reached first when proximity could do the work for him.

They met by accident.


---

It happened in a place Kyren frequented when he needed to think, an unremarkable café a few blocks from his temporary office. No screens. No music loud enough to interrupt thought. He had his laptop open, attention split between transaction logs and the movement of people around him.

Sarah Valentine ordered coffee at the counter.

Kyren noticed her immediately, not because she stood out, but because she didn’t try to. Curly blonde hair pulled back loosely, a tired patience in the way she waited, as if she were used to being overlooked and had learned to conserve energy instead of fighting it.

She chose the table next to his.

Not close enough to intrude. Not far enough to be anonymous.

She noticed his screen before she noticed him.

“Accounting?” she asked lightly, nodding toward the numbers.

Kyren closed the laptop without hesitation.

“Patterns,” he replied.

That earned him a smile. Brief. Curious.

“Same thing,” she said.

They spoke the way strangers do when neither is in a hurry to leave. Nothing personal at first. Weather. Work. The way companies liked to pretend inefficiency was inevitable instead of engineered.

Sarah was sharper than she let on. Kyren clocked it immediately. She phrased observations as jokes, insights as complaints. It was the language of someone who had learned that clarity attracted scrutiny.

When she asked what he did, Kyren didn’t lie.

“I investigate internal risk,” he said. “Mostly financial.”

She studied him then, not suspicious, but attentive.

“That sounds… lonely,” she said.

Kyren considered that.

“It’s quieter,” he replied.

That seemed to land.

They spoke for another twenty minutes. Kyren didn’t steer the conversation; he shaped the pauses. Let her fill them. Let her decide what mattered. He asked questions that sounded general and listened for what she avoided.

She mentioned her job only when he didn’t ask about it.

That told him more than anything else.

When she finally stood to leave, she hesitated, just long enough for Kyren to notice.

“If you’re free tonight,” she said, casual but not careless, “I make a decent dinner. Better than anything around here.”

Kyren saw the offer for what it was.

Opportunity.

Not because she was careless, but because proximity invited honesty in ways interrogation never could. He weighed the risk, the ethics, the cost. He had already crossed the point of neutrality the moment he followed the trail past its first false ending.

He nodded once.

“Alright,” he said.


---

Dinner was simple. Pasta bolognese. Wine she apologized for even though it was good. Sarah moved comfortably in her kitchen, habits revealing more than words ever could. No excess. No signs of sudden wealth. No performance.

Kyren let her talk.

About work. About exhaustion. About how easy it was to become invisible when people had already decided what role you played. He asked questions that sounded sympathetic and listened for what surfaced naturally.

She spoke carefully, but not defensively.

And then, somewhere between the second glass of wine and the quiet settling of the evening, she said something small.

A detail.

A name mentioned without emphasis. A process described as routine that shouldn’t have been. A moment she dismissed as unimportant.

Kyren felt it immediately.

That internal shift.
That alignment.

He didn’t react. Didn’t correct her. Didn’t lean forward.

He simply asked one more question; soft, unassuming, placed exactly where it would do the most damage.

Sarah answered.

And just like that, the shape of the case changed completely.

Kyren thanked her for dinner when he left. His voice was steady. His expression unreadable. She smiled, unaware of what had just been set in motion.

Outside, the city moved as it always did: loud, careless, convinced of its own permanence.

Kyren stepped into the night with something heavy and precise settling into place.

He had what he needed.


---

Kyren didn’t sleep.

He returned to his temporary office just before midnight, the city quieting into something more honest outside the windows. He didn’t turn on the overhead lights. The glow from his screen was enough.

He rebuilt the case from the beginning.

Not forward. Backward.

He started with the detail Sarah had offered so casually, the one that had shifted everything without her realizing it. He traced it through internal logs, permissions, archived correspondence. He cross-checked timestamps, access points, metadata most people never thought to look at.

The pieces aligned too cleanly.

What he had mistaken at first for displacement revealed itself as insulation. Layers of protection built deliberately, not for theft, but for control. Money moved where it shouldn’t because it was meant to, because someone had designed a system where accountability could be redirected downward when necessary.

Sarah Valentine wasn’t the thief.

She wasn’t even the fall.

She was the buffer.

Kyren leaned back in his chair, fingers steepled, eyes unfocused. He felt the familiar settling in his chest, not anger, not triumph.

Recognition.

The documents confirmed what his instincts already knew: Sarah had been placed exactly where pressure could be applied without consequence. Close enough to touch the flow. Far enough to absorb blame. Replaceable in theory. Disposable in practice.

And now she knew something.

Not enough to articulate it. Not enough to accuse anyone. But enough to be dangerous.

Kyren scrolled through personnel changes over the past two years. Promotions that didn’t make sense. Departures that happened quietly, always framed as personal decisions. One pattern repeated often enough to stop being coincidence.

People who noticed too much didn’t stay long.

He thought of Sarah’s kitchen. The careful way she spoke. The way she framed insights as inconveniences, never as conclusions. The way she offered dinner without knowing why she felt compelled to.

She didn’t know she was in danger.

That made it worse.

Kyren closed his eyes briefly. He understood the shape of the moment he stood in. Moments like this didn’t announce themselves. They arrived disguised as professionalism, as procedure, as patience.

There were two ways forward.

One was clean.

He could take what he had; documents, corroboration, the beginnings of a clear narrative, and deliver it to Charles Buddingham. Let the company handle it internally. Let process take over. Let distance absolve him of responsibility.

That was the expected path.

The other was not.

The other required speed. Discretion. A willingness to move before permission was granted. It meant acknowledging that systems protected themselves first... and people last.

It meant acting.

Kyren stared at the screen, the cursor blinking steadily as if waiting for instruction. He thought of the woman at the center of it all, unaware that her proximity to truth had already made her vulnerable.

He thought of the contract.

He thought of consequence.

Whatever he chose next would not be temporary. It would not end with this case. It would define how he moved through the world from this point forward, how much darkness he was willing to carry so others didn’t have to.

Kyren reached for his coat.

The decision formed quietly, without ceremony.

But it did not reveal itself yet.


---

Kyren made the call from his car.

It rang twice before Charles Buddingham answered, his voice tight with irritation that hadn’t yet decided what shape it wanted to take.

“It’s late,” Buddingham said. “This couldn’t wait until morning?”

“No,” Kyren replied. “It couldn’t.”

There was a pause on the line; brief, controlled. Buddingham was a man who understood tone as well as timing.

“What did you find?” he asked.

Kyren didn’t soften it.

“The thief isn’t Sarah Valentine,” he said. “It never was. The money routes through her department, but the approvals come from above. The access trails lead to Mitch Macintosh.”

The silence that followed was heavier than anything Buddingham had said so far.

“That’s a serious accusation,” he finally replied.

“It’s not an accusation,” Kyren said. “It’s documentation. I have transaction logs, metadata, audit alterations, and a corroborating pattern of personnel removals tied to his oversight.”

Buddingham exhaled slowly.

“Mitch is our senior finance expert,” he said. “You understand what you’re implying.”

“I do,” Kyren said. “You should also understand this: Sarah Valentine is in danger.”

Buddingham’s voice sharpened. “That’s speculation.”

“It’s pattern,” Kyren corrected. “And it’s already started.”

He told Buddingham what he’d seen. The backward checks. The disappearances. The way people who noticed too much simply stopped being reachable. He didn’t dramatize it. He didn’t need to.

When he finished, Buddingham spoke carefully.

“This is bigger than you think,” he said. “If Mitch is involved, there are channels we have to go through. Legal. Internal security. We cannot act rashly.”

Kyren turned the key in the ignition.

“That takes time,” he said. “She doesn’t have time.”

“Kyren-” Buddingham began.

“I’m informing you,” Kyren said, voice steady, final. “Not asking permission.”

“You’re young,” Buddingham said, frustration bleeding through now. “You don’t understand what you’re stepping into.”

Kyren pulled out of the parking lot.

“I understand exactly what it looks like when companies wait,” he said. “And what it costs.”

The line went quiet.

Then Buddingham said, low and deliberate, “If you do this alone, you expose yourself. You void protections. You put yourself in the middle of something you cannot control.”

Kyren accelerated.

“I’m already in it,” he replied. “I just refuse to stand still.”

He ended the call before Buddingham could respond.


---

The Shelby Mustang GT500 surged forward the moment Kyren pressed the accelerator, the engine’s growl swallowed by the night. The car was blacked out, indistinct, built for speed and stability rather than attention. He drove the way he worked: fast when it mattered, precise always.

The city blurred past him in sharp lines of light and shadow.

Kyren replayed Sarah’s apartment number in his mind. The building. The street. The way she’d smiled when she handed him a plate, unaware of how close danger already was.

He pushed harder.


---

The parking lot was empty when he arrived.

That was the first wrong note.

Kyren took the stairs two at a time, senses sharp, breathing even. The hallway on her floor smelled wrong; metallic, stale, like air that had been disturbed and never settled back into place.

Her door was ajar.

Kyren slowed.

Inside, the apartment was chaos.

Furniture overturned. Drawers emptied onto the floor. A lamp shattered near the wall. The quiet aftermath of force applied quickly and efficiently. No blood. No body.

No Sarah.

Kyren stood still in the doorway, eyes tracking details automatically. This wasn’t a robbery. Nothing of value was missing. This was removal.

He stepped inside, careful not to touch anything. His jaw tightened, not in anger, but in something colder.

Understanding.

Someone had come for her.

And they had known exactly when.

Kyren closed his eyes for a fraction of a second.

This was what power looked like when it moved unchecked. Not loud. Not public. Just absence where a person had been.

He opened them again.

Whatever illusion he’d had about process saving people dissolved quietly, completely.


---

Weeks later, Buddingham would thank him.

Privately. Carefully. With words chosen to acknowledge truth without admitting liability. Mitch Macintosh would be “handled.” The company would “restructure.” Sarah Valentine would be officially classified as having left voluntarily.

Kyren would be hired again.

And again.

Their partnership would grow. Not in trust, but in mutual recognition.

Buddingham understood now what kind of man Kyren was.

Interesting counterpoints to common Big A talking points

1) P/E ratios are suuuuuper high when its possibly just a difference in how earnings are calculated now vs in the past

2) The mag7 is more diversified than some people give it credit for, because they have very diversified revenue/products), and those companies act more as hold co's than individual companies

So with the (US) winter months taking a toll on battery life, some of you might be feeling handy, and want to replace your (ideally dead) battery. Just a heads-up, it is not as straightforward as some vehicles, so, here is a brief tutorial, so you don’t have to figure it out while it is 1°F outside! 

No exceptionally specialized knowledge is required - if you own a ratchet set, and have changed a battery before, you are 90% of the way there. This is on a 2025 Santa Fe Calligraphy (non-hybrid) with the MX5 ICE. Looks like the lower trims are the same, in my googling. 

What you need: 

\- ratchet!

\- 10mm socket

\- 12mm socket

\- 6-8” socket extension (or longer, but 6” minimum for ease of access). If you don’t have one, you can try to fit a shorty ratchet in the space, but I do not recommend it. A long socket-screwdriver will also work, but may be a bit more difficult. 

\- battery

Replacement Steps: (photos are numbered, these correlate to the images)

1. Unlock the positive side box by pushing in the tab. 

2. Pull the positive side box open - it is hinged, it swings open, unlike some that pop-off.

3. Check the main fuse! Will save you a lot of headache and money. Fuse is like $5, battery is like $250. It is hard to see in my pic, but it would be burnt and the connection broken if it was the fuse - pretty obvious. 

4. If the fuse is good, but car is still dead, it is the battery! Jumping it is always an option too. So if you want to do that, this is where you stop. Connect your cables, get it to start, let it sit for 10-15 mins, and then close ‘er up. This guy is going on a long trip, so I am opting for a new battery. If you are opting for a swap, continue reading! Take your 10mm socket, loosen this bolt. Dont take it OFF, just loosen until this whole box will slide off. 

5. Disconnect your ground. Same 10mm socket does the job - and again, do not remove the nut, just loosen until it slides off.

6. You have probably already done this, but pull the positive box back a bit, because we need to get to the bottom of the battery. Dont worry, it is just some stiff wires, they will go right back into place. I lodged mine next to the fuse box, on the right. 

7. Remove the battery bracket. The battery should have a lip around the edges that is held down by this bracket. The rear-most side (near firewall) of the battery has one as well, but it is stationary. So this guy has to come out. Grab your 6+” extension rod, and a 12mm socket. The bolt is not captive, so consider loosening it a great deal w/ your tool, and finishing it by hand. You could use a long(er) socket screwdriver as well, but it did take a bit of effort to break-loose on mine, so, ratchet is preferred. Be sure to mind the battery terminals while getting your face super close to reach it. 

8. This is a combination step - once 7 is completed, do everything in reverse! 

\- Pull the old battery out, 

\- take off the insulation, 

\- put the insulation on the new battery, 

\- and pop the new one in (terminals need to be facing LEFT, same side as the engine). When putting in the new battery, it has to slide back to get into that rear bracket. It’s easy to figure out. 

\- Once the battery is sitting flat (doesn’t rock or move around), replace your front bracket. Mind that the battery should have a small lip (highlighted in pic), and the bracket should be sitting on that. I tightened the bracket in a bit by hand, just to get it situated, then finished it with the ratchet. 

9. replace your ground wire, use your 10mm.

10. Replace your positive wire. This part almost got me, because it doesn’t SEEM like the box should fit over the raised edges of the top of the battery - but it does! Had to wiggle it a bit. 

11. Clean up your mess, clear your tools, start the car! If it starts up, good job! If not - reassess your wire connections - that ground connection was a bit tout on mine. 

And done! Put your tools away, close that hood, and go get yourself a treat - you earned it. (If it is single-digit temps while you’re doing this, like mine was, maybe grab a nice tall coffee and a hot muffin from the convenience store 🤌🏼)",7,1765824320.0,HyundaiSantaFe,2,0.9,False

Tengo algunas preguntas y esperaba poder recibir orientación al respecto. Agradezco de antemano cualquier consejo.

1. Como parte del programa, voy a vivir con una familia local. No sabré la composición de la familia hasta mucho antes de mi llegada o quizá hasta que esté allí. Por ese motivo, es difícil comprar regalos adecuados para su edad. Teniendo esto en cuenta, ¿qué tipo de regalos apreciaría una familia guatemalteca si les llevara? Tengo pensado llevar cosas de mi ciudad en Estados Unidos (por ejemplo, una taza de café con el nombre de mi ciudad), pero ¿hay algo más que les guste a los guatemaltecos o que les resulte útil?

2. Esto es principalmente para Xela, pero también tengo intención de ir al lago Atitlán y a Antigua al menos por un rato mientras esté allí. ¿Qué tipo de ropa debería llevar principalmente? Según Internet, esos son los meses más cálidos en Xela, pero quiero consejos de quienes están allí.

3. ¿Hay algún consejo aleatorio que me darían para facilitarme la vida y aclimatarme más rápido a la cultura mientras esté allí? Ya tengo un buen dominio del español, así que no debería tener problemas para comunicarme con personas pacientes.

4. ¿Qué tan abiertos son los guatemaltecos a que personas desconocidas les hablen? ¿Reaccionarán de manera diferente si se trata de una persona blanca alta? Extranjero obvio

5. ¡Por favor, denme recomendaciones de experiencias que debería tener en ese periodo de tiempo! Especialmente cosas cerca de Xela.

¡Gracias por cualquier consejo!

Hello everyone, In February of next year I'm going to be going on an adventure to Guatemala. I will be attending a Spanish immersion school in Xela for 3 months!(February-April). I had a few questions I was hoping I could get some guidance on and I appreciate any advice in advance.

1. I will be living with a local family as part of my program. I wont know the composition of the family until much closer to my time of arrival or maybe not even until I am there. For that reason, getting age appropriate gifts is difficult. Given that, what sort of gifts would a Guatemalan family appreciate if I brought it to them? I plan on bringing some stuff from my city in the US(think coffee mug with my city on it), but is there anything else that Guatemalans like or would be useful to them?

2. This is mostly for Xela, but I also intend to go to Lake Atitlán and Antigua at least for a bit while there. What sort of clothing should I primarily bring with me? According to the internet, those are the warmest months in Xela, but I want advice from those that are there.

3. Is there any random advice you would give me to make my life easier and to acclimate to the culture faster while there? I already have a decent grasp of listening to Spanish so I should have no problem communicating with patient speakers.

4. How open are guatemalans to people randomly talking to them? Will they react differently if its a tall white person? Obviously foreigner

5. Please provide recommendations of experiences I should have in that time frame! Especially things close to Xela.

Thank you for any advice!",6,1765824240.0,guatemala,6,1.0,False

My brain now associates the table with naps and distractions instead of focus. 

I’ve tried everything: moving the table near the window for better light, keeping as little as possible on it to avoid clutter, even setting timers to force myself to stay awake. None of it sticks. The second I sit down, it’s like my body goes, oh cool, nap time.

Old school Rhône wine.  Thick and soupy, stick to your ribs, gray overcast weather type shit.  Cooking all day, house smelling good, umami for days.

With a mix of rich, pan-sauced blackberries, choco-cherries and greener elements like peppercorn and garrigue-y herbs (salty, resinous, aromatic wild herb aromas and flavors), the 2021 Domaine du Cayron Gigondas gives you a taste of the culmination of decades of optimizing a wine’s flavor to complement the region’s country cuisine.  

This is a fall and winter wine for those recipes you have been waiting on all year.

The Southern Rhône reds have always famously been a blend of Grenache, Syrah and Mourvedre. Blended together, they are more than the sum of their parts - but recent changes in global tastes have led to cleaner, fruitier, less individual wines.  

It’s not a bad thing - give me choices!  There are beautiful wines on the transparent side and then big, dumb delicious milkshake Rhônes on the other end.

Yet I do find myself missing the carnivorousness of classic Rhône wines, which is becoming a bit tougher to find.  Where’s my bloody, bacony, figgy, coffee country stew of a wine?  The Southern Rhone should be The Source for meaty, savory wines that you can stand a fork in.  I don’t want filthy brett bombs but can I have a little paysan juice?  
  
The signature taste of these Grenache blends is ""slow-cooked"", rich, developed....that beautiful mix of fruit gastrique, simmered herbs, meat drippings and stone lickin’s.  Cayron was one of the first wines that gave me the “oh now that’s a fucking wine, not just fruit juice” moment almost twenty years ago.  I’m glad that it’s still serious as hell nowadays.  

Cayron’s Gigondas is a blend of old-vine, organic Grenache, Syrah, Carignan and Mourvedre from high-altitude vineyards.  Whole cluster fermentation.  Unfined and unfiltered.  Aged in concrete and old large foudre barrels.  One wine only, made by three sisters. I love this shit.

I feel so overwhelmed and hurt by her.","Was talking to gpt a lot, but I need real life feed back, this is what gpt summarised:

My girlfriend and I just started university in a new city. For the past two weeks and still ongoing, we’ve had/are having shortests\*. Our daily routine is to attend classes and then stay in the library until around 10 PM before going home together. I have my own apartment, but I chose to move in with her because she didn’t want to live alone, and she said if I moved out, it would feel like we broke up.

Currently, our relationship has the following issues:

**Relationship dynamics:**

* **Unequal emotional investment:** I care about her a lot and prioritize her needs, but she rarely seems to prioritize mine.
* **One-sided expectations:** She frequently sets demands for me, which I try to meet, but she does not reciprocate when I have needs (which only limits to her explaining things to me and just go through the topics with me).
* **Conflicts over chores, cooking, and time together:**
   * She claims I don’t do housework, but I do the necessary tasks, and I will do other things if she asks.
   * With cooking, I usually prepare food for both of us, but she rarely prepares for me. Sometimes she complains if I don’t cook for her because I did not know if she would want to eat my food.
* **Independent behavior:** She sometimes leaves without telling me, e.g., going to a coffee shop or hanging out with friends, ignoring me entirely and making me feel excluded.
* **Power imbalance:** She is in a way the ""landlord"". When I raise concerns, she often uses “just move out” or her landlord role to shut down discussions.

**My own issues:**

* I recognize that I can be stubborn, immature at times, and have a victim mentality. I sometimes give her the cold shoulder or make facial expressions when I’m frustrated.
* I feel strong jealousy when she interacts with others, which drains me emotionally. Especially these days, we are in the library, she always explains things to other people wth great effort, but regrets to explain anything to me because if I asked her followup questions, I have a ""bad attitude"" while doing so.
* I want to regain personal space, focus on self-care, and limit our interaction.
* I am considering ending the romantic aspect of our relationship or mentally detaching.

**Recent events:**

1. I tried prioritizing her needs but ended up feeling ignored, jealous, and emotionally exhausted.
2. I attempted cold behavior and emotional withdrawal, which led to strong anger and some thoughts of revenge, because she doesn’t seem to need me.
3. She went out with friends or bought food only for her and without including me, but at the same time I always try to get her something to eat, making me feel excluded. I have been avoiding our social circle to reduce discomfort.
4. When she sees me angry (mimics, I often hold my fist because I am then usually under a lot of stress), she says she’s scared. While she is stressed which is almost daily because of the studies, she screams and pushes me while I try to avoid her or talk to her calmly.I
5. I frequently argue over her behaviour and not spending time with me together when we are in the library(we are there pretty much every single day). She often shuts down discussion using her landlord role and tells me to move out or look for someone else who does not have ""her flaws"".
6. She calls me stubborn, but I notice she’s equally stubborn and uses her power to dismiss my concerns.

**My feelings:**

* I feel her behavior is hypocritical and unfair, and it makes me feel disgusted, angry, and hurt.
* I sometimes expect her to apologize or admit fault for really small things in which she's obviously wrong, but I know that’s unlikely.
* I’m unsure if I’m being selfish or if I’ve done something wrong in the relationship.
* I want to clarify my reasons for leaving to myself, but I also need to consider the practical reality of cohabitation (we’re moving into a new apartment together next April).

**My questions:**

1. Have I done something wrong in this relationship?
2. Is it reasonable to detach emotionally and limit our interaction to functional cohabitation?
3. Are her behaviors (ignoring me, provoking me, using landlord power to shut down discussion) acceptable, or do I have the right to be angry?
4. How can I maintain boundaries while cohabiting without letting her manipulate my emotions?",0,1765824055.0,relationship_advice,8,0.2,False

**Parsing the Odds: Who’s the Favorite?**  
The numbers don’t lie (well, they *implied* probabilities, but let’s not get too meta). For this December 17 clash, the Blue Jackets are the clear favorites, with decimal odds hovering around **1.70** (implying a **58.8% chance to win** per DraftKings). The Ducks, meanwhile, sit at **2.20**, translating to a **45.5% implied probability**—about the same chance as finding a functional urinal in a crowded stadium. The spread favors Columbus by 1.5 goals, and the total is set at 6.5, suggesting bookmakers expect a high-scoring affair.

**Digesting the News: Ducks with Leaks, Blue Jackets with Secrets**  
The Ducks just got humbled by the Devils, 4-1, exposing their defensive Achilles’ heel: **high-danger chance share below 48%**. Their five-on-five shot share is decent (51%), but their expected-goal share is anemic (under 49%), meaning they’re as likely to score on a coffee table as a net. Lukas Dostal, their starting goalie, will need to channel his inner *human vault* to keep pace.

On the flip side, Columbus’s recent form is a mystery, but their odds suggest they’re the NHL’s version of a *sneaky siege engine*. If they’ve got a solid defense (or a goalie who can stop pucks like they’re owed money), they’ll exploit Anaheim’s porous net-front defense.

The fluorescent lights inside the gas station buzzed like dying insects. Parker stood in front of the candy rack trying to choose between Twizzlers and black licorice when the bell above the door chimed again. 

Two girls walked in with an older woman who was probably one of their mom's judging by the sun-bleached hair. 

One girl wore a pink tank top and cut off shorts. The other had braces that shimmered every time she laughed. 

Parker pretended to study the nutrition facts on a pack of Skittles, but he caught Isaac in the reflection of the soda case.


Isaac was completely still, pork rinds in hand, as he tracked the girl in pink like her shirt was a lazer pointer. 

The girls both ordered fountain drinks, whispering and giggling loud enough that everyone in the cramped store could hear. When they passed the counter, the braces girl looked right at Isaac and rolled her eyes. 


""Ugh, no way, he's a smelly weirdo,"" she whispered too loudly. 

Pink-tank-top burst into laughter right behind the guys.


Parker felt heat swim up his neck, but Isaac didn't react. 

They checked out first, buying two Cokes and the bag of pork rinds. 

Outside, the girls were getting into a grey, dusty minivan. 

The mom lingered in the store catching up with the cashier. She finally walked out and immediately greeted Isaac.



""Isaac Boone, is that you? It's been ages!"" She smiled the way adults do when they're about to ask you an uncomfortably awkward question. 

""How're your folks? Still in South America?"" 

Isaac's face shuttered to complete blankness before he blinked and put on a reassuring smile. 

""Yes, ma'am. Still out of town.""


The woman's smile changed to confusion for a half a second, then returned to friendly. 

""Well, you let them know I'm praying for them. And if your grandma needs a Mahjong partner, she's got my number."" 

She waved a greeting to Parker who reciprocated then joined the girls in the minivan.


Parker took a deep breath and looked jittery. The newspaper clipping from the shed had not left his mind. He was sure now that his almost best friend was hiding something. 

Isaac was already walking to their bikes with the pork rind bag shaking and crinkling with every step. Parker followed, swallowing hard as a bitter copper taste suddenly coated his tongue.



That was the exact moment the sky opened up without warning. One second they were walking with their snacks and the next it was grey then the rain fell sideways. 

Isaac popped a wheelie, half laughing, half-swearing, and headed toward the old County Bridge 9. 

Parker followed, clothes already stuck to his skin before they even got to cover. The concrete arch boomed from the rain above sheeting off the edges. Their bikes clattered against the concrete wall, spokes dripping softly.


The occasional thunder clap was punctuated by their heavy breathing, the under bridge smelling of mildew and moss. 

Parker rung out his polo shirt, which didn't really help. Isaac found an overturned five-gallon bucket to plop down on with his elbows to the knees, staring at the water pooling in a puddle of broken concrete. Parker slid down the wall and sat on the ground, the concrete cold but dry on his athletic shorts. 

""I hate rain like this,"" he muttered. Isaac didn't respond. The darkness underneath the bridge felt miles away from the comfort of their blanket fort.



""My mom and dad used to have a normal relationship. Happy, even,"" he stopped and swallowed hard. ""Joking around and laughing about everything. Then, after my sister was born, it all went downhill.
My dad started staying at work late, and mom would spend all day in her room. 

I got a bad grade in Algebra and was so sure I was going to get in trouble. 

Instead, my mom took me into her room and told me dad was moving out.""
Parker paused as his voice cracked at the last word. 

""She said he was having trouble handling everything lately. And I knew 'everything' involved me.""


Isaac didn't move, his eyes stayed fixed on the water. ""Maybe it is my fault,"" Parker whispered. He couldn't get out anymore words. One small tear fell from his face and he quickly wiped it away. He cleared his throat and then the grief bulldozed him. 

His shoulders shook and his face turned beet red. Isaac still sat in silence. When Parker was done, he wiped his face with the back of his hand, then his damp shirt. 

The thunder finally began to move away and the rain turned into a drizzle. Before they decided to leave, Parker prompted Isaac.


""What about you?"" he said, sniffling still. ""How come you live with your Grandma?"" 

Parker had been curious for weeks, but the encounter in the gas station parking lot finally pushed him to ask. 

Isaac turned his head slowly and looked at Parker for the first time in a while. ""Be glad your mom's still here,"" he said, soft enough to be muffled by the rain. Before Parker could get ask another question, Isaac stood up and grabbed his bike. 

""Storm's letting up. We gotta move fast before the creek floods.""


Parker stood up and tried to stop Isaac. ""Isaac--"" 

""Would you come on?"" 

They stepped from under the bridge into a lightly wet air. 

Isaac stopped Parker and held out his pinky finger. ""We're going to finish this ladder no matter what,"" he said. ""Swear it.""



Parker snorted. ""What are we in elementary school?"" Isaac didn't join in on the laughter. He didn't even blink but kept his finger sticking out like a loaded gun. Parker rolled his eyes but still hooked his pinky anyway. A pinky swear was safer than a blood oath. 

""I swear."" 

Isaac gave one strong tug hard enough for it to ache afterwards. 

He let go first and wiped his hand on his damp shorts then swung his leg over his bike without a word.


The night they completed Rung 8, the sky was so clear it was painful to look at. 

They rode out at 1:30 am, no headlights on their helmets, coasting for the last half-mile so they wouldn't wake anything that might be alive at that hour. Highway 12 was empty in either direction. They dropped their bikes near the ditch and walked into the road and up to the double yellow line, then layed on their backs.


Above their heads the stars swirled like a salt shaker in the sky. ""I'm getting out of here. Florida maybe. Or Texas. A place with warm weather and a beach."" 

""If you pick Texas, let me come with."" 

Isaac didn't answer him right away. Crickets serenaded in the distance as an eighteen wheeler rumbled. 

""Though, some things. They follow you no matter how far you run,"" Isaac finally said. His words hung heavier than the humid air. ""At least I'd get a head start.""


Isaac stared sharply against the starlight with eyes angled upward like he was reading the constellations. 

Parker wanted to know more, but his question got lodged in his throat. Instead, he joined Isaac in staring at the moon until everything began to spin and he had to close his eyes. 

Three days later, they began Rung 9.



Isaac knocked on Parker's door at dawn with a handsaw, a hammer and a backpack filled with nails he probably found in the shed. They worked in the weeds behind Isaac's house. 

Discarded pallets, scrap tin, and even old billboards were scavenged and dragged through the brush. 

Parker's arms were sore and red by the next day. 

Isaac never said an unenthusiastic word, he sawed and hammered the walls of the fort like it was his job. By the third afternoon the platform was already six feet up. They crawled out onto the wooden planks and looked across the tops of the trees hidden enough that the birds could never find it.


They took a break from baking under the sun and headed 

to Parker's pale yellow house. When they got to the driveway they could see Parker's mom in the window.


She drifted from window to window like a bird in an invisible cage. She stood in the kitchen first, then the living room, and back again. Over and over. 

Both boys went still as they watched her silhouette float behind the kitchen curtains.


Parker watched for a full minute before the discomfort began crawling under his skin. She wasn't actually looking at anything. Just stared like a zombie. Minutes passed, maybe five or ten. Parker's stomach started flipping in his gut. He leaned over, his palms to his knees and wretched.


""Dude,"" Isaac said concerned and got closer. Parker responded with a thumbs up and a slow and long blink that looked painful. 

""I fucking knew it,"" Isaac said while staring at Parker’s mom, too quiet for Parker to adequately hear it. 

""What?"" 

Isaac shook his head. ""One rung left."" 

Parker's mom's silhouette disappeared behind the curtain of the kitchen window. Then she opened the front door and beckoned the pair to come inside.


Isaac and Parker both exhaled in relief at the same time. 

She was back to normal for now.



Part 5


The hideout may have been made of nailed plywood and scrap tin, but it felt like the only bright spot in Anniston. 

Three hundred yards between each of their homes and far enough away that no one would hear them enough to be bothered.


They sat cross-legged on the thin wooden floor, crammed in tight enough that their knees almost touched. 

The lantern glowed in the middle of the floor casting light on the walls and turning their shadows into monsters behind them. Outside, the crickets had been chirping all night. Then, without warning, they all stopped at once. It wasn't noticeable at first, until the silence rushed in and became deafening.


Neither felt they had much of a choice except to fill the emptiness. Isaac spoke first, monotone, like he was reading the ingredients list from a cereal box.



""Welp, rung 10,"" he said. ""What's the worst thing you ever did or that happened to you? Remember, no lies, no take backs."" 

Parker swallowed his nerves. Rung 10 had been hanging over his head for a while. He was relieved they didn't have to go jump into the quarry. School was starting sooner than they knew and it would be worth it as the new kid to have at least one friend already. Knowing each other's deepest secrets could also protect against getting blackmailed. 

Especially, if they ended up liking the same girl. He stared at the lantern until the flame doubled.



""When I was eleven, my sister was born dead,"" he started tugging the words out forcefully. ""Cord wrapped around her neck. In the middle of the night at the bottom of the stairs. Mom screamed loud enough to wake the whole neighborhood.


One night I woke up and thought the house was empty because of how quiet it was. 

I found her on the bathroom floor. Her face was gray and her lips were blue. 

I spent a week at the neighbor's house and when I got home I saw the hospital discharge papers on the coffee table and saw the words suicidal ideation."" The lantern popped loudly after a brief moment of quiet. 

""It was the beginning of the end. A year and a half later, here we are in Indiana.""


Isaac was completely still the whole time. He didn't even breathe loudly enough to be heard in the small fort. His eyes stayed fixed on the lantern on the floor between them. 

""Okay, your turn."" Isaac took a long look at him, longer than five seconds, as if he was mentally sizing him up. Then he spoke, calm as if he was reading the weather:


""I killed my parents. And my grandma."" 

The confession hit the room like a bomb, violent and permanent.


Parker waited for a half-grin, a smirk, a quick ""gotcha"" that would give him a sense of relief. It never came. Isaac continued talking in the same low voice.


""My parents spent my whole life doing missions trips across South America. I was born in Honduras. Two years ago, in June, they told Grandma on the satellite phone there was an outbreak of an illness but they were fine and would be on a plane in five days. 

But, they didn't show up. Grandma called them, reached out to the South American Government but didn't get any answers. 

Thankfully, my parents finally did come home from Guatemala. Grandma met me on the porch before I could even drop my backpack. 

She blocked the doorway and told me, ""Your mom and dad are really tired from their trip. Let them sleep.""


Even at eleven I knew jet-lag didn’t make you so tired you stay locked in your room for eight days straight with a bodyguard at the door. 

After eight days of mostly listening to Grandma shuffle around the house I started hearing others moving around. 

A slow but light pair of footsteps kept walking over the same three floorboards that made a repetitive creaking sound.


On the eighth night, Grandma finally let me in the room to see my parents. They both sat at the edge of the bed, side by side in their pajamas. Mom's eye's glanced at me but they were empty. The lights were on but no one was home. Dad looked at me, his eyes holding a familiar smile, except it never reached his mouth.


He put out his arm and patted my head. 

""Hey buddy,"" he said, voice exactly as I remembered. ""Missed you..."" Then he just...stopped. The smile was frozen, his breath was paused, and his eyes lost their focus. He somehow didn't blink or drool. 

Mom stood up and walked over to the closet door and stood looking at it. 

She stayed there. Ten minutes. Then twenty. And I didn't see my Dad move again while I was in that room. They were like mannequins.


That night, I put my ear to the air vent to listen for the usual sounds: the TV, my dad's snoring, Grandma's feet shuffling into the kitchen.


All I heard was the sound of those same three floorboards upstairs in the same familiar rhythm: creak...creak...creak. It was infuriatingly repetitive, over and over, never speeding up or slowing down or stopping.


Then Grandma's slippers went quietly across the kitchen floor downstairs. The half-bath door squealed open. Then it closed. Then it opened again thirty seconds later. Then closed. Over and over at the same speed for a while.



I never heard Dad. Not so much as a small cough or even a twist on the mattress. The walking continued until birds started yelling at the sun through my window. I didn't want to move from under my bed. 

I heard my Grandma calling me from downstairs. I didn't want to go but what was I supposed to do? 

I met her in the kitchen, her back turned to me at the refrigerator. 

I greeted her. 

She said nothing. 

I sat at the table with trembling fingers darting into the table. 

Finally she turned around and I could see that she was holding a knife. Her eyes were empty and looked past the room as she walked toward me. 


I screamed, ""Grandma!"" once, twice. She didn't budge. 

Just kept moving slow and steady holding that carving knife like she was about to slice my head off. 

I ran. I bolted out the back door across the yard and inside the shed. I had to stand on Dad's workbench just to reach. 
I finally got the .30-30 off the wall, my hands were shaking so bad it kept clacking against the hooks. 

When I came back inside, Grandma was at the sink with her sleeves rolled up washing dishes and humming hymns as she did. 

""Dinner will be ready in twenty minutes, hon,"" she said still facing the sink. ""Go wash up.""


The voice was perfect. Almost believable except, it was 8:30 in the morning. 

I levered a round into the chamber, she didn't even budge at the loud, metallic clack behind her. I held the gun trembling on her. Then lost my nerve and started up the stairs.



Mom was standing at the bedroom window with her forehead against the glass, eyes wide and mouth agape. Dad sat in the easy chair, hands folded in his lap, staring at the wall.


Mom went first. Took me two shots. I aimed for the base of the skull, like Dad taught me with the deer. She fell backwards like a tree. 

Dad was easier. I was able to get the shot off in the first try with him. 

Then, I went back downstairs for Grandma. I could barely look when she fell at the kitchen sink.


I dragged them one by one into Grandma's room in the back. 

Between the stairs, the bodies leaking, and the smell, it took me four days. 

Wrapped them up in sheets on the bed. Then I pushed Grandma's cedar armoire in front of the door.


I haven't gone into that the part of the house in almost two years. Sometimes the floorboard still creaks at night.""


He stopped talking as the flame of the lantern shriveled into the dark. Outside the crickets were still dead silent.


Parker tried to get ahold of his breath. He just knew he was getting pranked. ""You're joking."" 

Isaac finally blinked. 

""I pray to God that I was just joking. Every day.""


Isaac leaned forward into the lantern. ""Parker, your mom's already turning,"" he said, in a softer, more human tone. 

""You've seen her. You have to end it soon or you'll be sorry.""


Parker ran all the way home, briar branches scratching up his legs. His lungs burned as he bolted into the kitchen and flipped on the light switch. His mom was there staring out the window. Her palms were flat on the glass and her expression was blank like she was daydreaming. 

""Mom?"" he said in a shaky, uncertain voice. She didn't move. ""Mom!"" She turned around slowly and Parker ran to tackle her.


Parker's heart exploded as he threw his arms around her. She was stiff at first but quickly reciprocated after a few seconds and patted his head. ""What is it, honey?"" she asked, voice soft and polite, like a bank teller. ""Did you and Isaac get into a fight?"" 

He pulled away from her and mumbled an excuse that he was tired and ran to his room. 

He shut the door and locked it and propped himself up gainst it. 

Even if Isaac's story was a complete lie, Mom had been out of it until he screamed at her. She had looked right through him. 

Parker sat at the foot of the door hugging his knees until her footsteps had stopped for good.



Part 6


Parker waited until the moon was high and large in the sky before he decided to walk the three hundred yards from the hideout to Isaac's house. He knew Isaac would be sleeping in the tent in the backyard; a house condemned by its only living occupant. Parker had a knife tucked into his belt he really hoped he wouldn't have to use.


The loose pane of the back window squeaked softly under Parker's strength. He pulled away a heap of blankets that was nailed over the frame and crawled through, dropping onto a carpet that was nearly bare under his sneakers. The smell engulfed him immediately: thick, wet, sweet-rot, like leaving hamburger meat in the Summer heat. It replaced all the air in his lungs and the space behind his eyes. He gagged, swallowing bile hard, and kept walking forward.


He finally got to see the inside of the house. 

The narrow hallway was dark with only the moonlight to guide him. At the end stood a red painted armoire in front of a door. He knew that was it. 

Three shapes lay on the bed wrapped from head to toe in white and grey bedsheets. The biggest one was on the left, likely Isaac's dad. The smaller one in the middle was his mom. Grandma was on the right, her body curled up in the fetal position. The fabric of the bedspread had been soaked through years ago; dark brown stains spread across pale flowers. Flies rose in a lazy haze as the air moved.


Parker stood in the doorway while his knees shook. The knife seemed unnecessary now.
He backed out of the room, the smell now baked into his nostrils and throat. He climbed out the same window, jogged briefly into the woods and vomited until nothing else would come up. 

The hideout was the same as they had left it. The lantern still burning where Isaac had turned it on. 

A piece of notebook paper sat in the middle of the floor, weighted down by a rock. In Isaac's handwriting of big, red letters: 


I TRIED TO WARN YOU.



Parker read the words over and over until they no longer made sense. His chest felt crushed on the inside. He took the lantern and note and went back home.



The yellow house was hidden in the dark except for the kitchen window. Parker's mom stood there with her forehead to the glass like Isaac's mom had. She didn't flinch when he opened the screen door. Didn't move until Parker called her name twice. Then her head turned smooth as if on a swivel. 

Her eyes were wide and reflective.



Parker sprawled out on the living room floor with the lantern at his feet and the knife across his knees. 

He waited for his mother to come ask him why he had it. 

She never did.


By early morning when the sun came up, the back door opened to Isaac in athletic shorts covered in mosquito bites and barefoot. 


""I know you went in,"" he said quietly. ""I didn't see you, but I know."" 

Parker couldn't speak. The chirping birds loudly circled.


Isaac stepped inside and closed the door behind him. 

""She's almost gone, isn't she?"" Parker finally managed a nod. 

Isaac looked up. ""We don't have much time. We have to finish this now, before it spreads to you."" 


He let his backpack fall to the floor at his feet. It hit the floor with a distinct metal clank.
""Finish this?"" Parker asked, secretly daring Isaac to say the words out loud. Isaac didn’t flinch. ""You got a knife, or you wanna borrow my dad's rifle?"" Parker's stomach dropped all the way into his shoes. 

""Are you insane? How am I even supposed to...?""
He waved his hands around and held them out as if he held an oblong watermelon, because there was no good way to properly mime what he was asking. 

""Wait til nightfall, put the body in a wheelbarrow under a blanket and push it to my house."" 

Parker let out an exacerbated sigh. ""And then what? Wait til the hospital calls when she stops showing up for work?"" 

""Then, for a few weeks,"" Isaac said. ""We go through every abandoned house up Highway 12. Sell all the copper wire,
scrap metal, and abandoned lawn equipment to Ricky at the scrapyard. When we've got $400 we can buy two one-way tickets to Sioux Falls. They're hiring at a beef plant. Nobody asks too many questions if you know enough Spanish. I can teach you.""


Parker stared at the floor in front of him. Isaac almost had their lives already planned out.


""Or we could wait,"" Isaac continued in a low tone, ""until your mom becomes a husk and kills you.""


Parker turned around and looked at his mother in the kitchen, back turned.


He stood up. The knife in his belt clattered onto the floor. 

""Six weeks,"" he whispered.


They shook pinkies once, hard and final in a pact to meet in three days at the hideout once the deed was done. 

Outside, the cicadas were screaming again, as if they suddenly remembered how to.



After three days, the morning rung out over their hideout and Parker was already there by the time Isaac pushed through the pine branches, sunlight poking through the tin roof and plywood slats. The lantern was there but dead; Isaac stopped in the doorway with slumped shoulders hunched over as if he anticipated being hit.


Parker's eyes were red and swollen, cheeks streaked in dried salt. The kitchen knife lay on the plywood between them, the blade streaked in mud.


""Every night I tried to do it,"" Parker whispered in a hoarse voice. ""I'd wait until she got quiet and sneak up behind her or over her bed at night. But every time I went to raise the knife, I'd see my own face in the reflection of the blade, with this psychotic look on my face. I didn't look scared or angry. But a type of sinister glee.
His voice broke and he paused for a moment. ""I've been sleeping on the porch. I can't even walk through the house without feeling her waiting for me to just end it.""
Parker gritted his teeth and tried to breathe deeply. He was sure he wasn't nearly as brave as his friend Isaac.


Isaac's face finally crumbled. The mask he had worn for so long had been shattered. He leaned forward head in hands, forehead in lap, and sobs eeked out of him that he had been holding in for months. Parker let his own eyes spill over, then. They sat on the floor and existed for minutes or maybe hours, time wasn't relevant anymore,  before Isaac wiped his face with his sleeve. 

""We can't fix this,"" he whispered. ""We can only get away from it."" 

Parker nodded. The plan came together the way only a couple of thirteen-year-olds can make things happen: one part hope, two parts desperation sprinkled liberally with certainty. 


Every day they started work at dawn and left at dusk. 

They raided every abandoned house down the highway prying copper out of the walls. They dragged broken lawn-mowers and lawn care equipment through briar patches. They sold it all to Ricky at the scrapyard for cash in rubberband rolls. 

After a few weeks, they had pocketed $412. 37.


August 18, they made it to the Greyhound station that smelled like fried food and bleach. They ordered two tickets to Sioux Falls, South Dakota and the clerk didn’t even look up. 

Parker wrote a note on the back of an electric bill: 

Mom, sorry I couldn't kill you. 

I love you. 

-Parker.


He left it under a magnet on the fridge, the same place where she used to leave him a twenty-dollar bill for pizza. 

The bus pulled out at 5:17 a.m. exactly on time. 

Parker pressed his forehead against the cold window and watched the world, shrink, shrink, shrink and then disappear. 

Isaac was already asleep nearly crushing Parker's shoulder with his head. Somewhere past Chattanooga the sun finally came up. Parker closed his eyes and the bus carried them north, mile after mile, the humming of its engine the only sound.

We’re flying in from Europe to visit a family member who just moved to the Holland, MI area right before Christmas, and we’re excited to spend the holidays together ✨🎁

Since we’re coming from overseas, it’s been a bit tricky figuring out what food/drinks/places we should know about - especially with Christmas and New Year coming up.

So we’re wondering:

Are there any local places you’d recommend for 

\- Christmas food or drinks?

\- Great spots to go to or order from (like festive meals, special holiday menus, holiday drinks, etc.)

\- Butchers or places to order meats/cuts from (if that’s a thing around here)

\- Local favorites for dinner, desserts, coffee, beer, cocktails - whatever you’d say “don’t miss this!”

\- Any seasonal/holiday markets, special events, or traditions we should check out (if we can even make it…) 

We’re open to all recommendations: local gems, classics, hidden spots, anything you think is worth trying!

Thanks in advance! (This all came together pretty last-minute: visas and tickets came through at the same time, and we decided to go so our family member wouldn’t be spending Christmas alone - any local tips are very appreciated ❤️ 🎅!).",1,1765824003.0,hollandmichigan,3,1.0,False

Went with the economy entry level setup to get into the game and now i think i need a support group to help with obsession over researching coffee gear on youtube/reddit.

I have a basic breville bambino for brewing and it is a pretty capable machine for the price. Love the quick on demand heat up and steam wands gets the job done. Not a huge fan of the plastic internal components though

For pourover, i still have my baratza encore which is loud and noisy but good enough as my palate is not developed enough to enjoy all the nuances of coffee yet

For espresso, I have a DF54 that I have a love/hate relationship with. At the time of purchase, it seemed like an incredible value for my sub $600 espresso setup for both the bambino and the grinder. Noise is noticeably more acceptable than the encore but this thing has significant QC issues. Espressoutlet sent me a metal declumper since mine clogged and stalled multiple times within first few months of ownership. I continue to have issues with grounds getting clogged in the chute and stalling the motor every couple months despite aggressive bellow use.

Looking to find something that is more BIFL ""buy once cry once"" and can likely convince the wife to budget under 2k for one.

I brew mostly espresso 2x/day and prefer milk drinks as my daily and enjoy light roast specialty pourover 2-3x/week. Trying to see if there's a way to consolidate my limited kitchen counter space with one that can switch between both espresso/pourover seamlessly

I live in the US so tariffs have been hurting. Niche zero is over 700$ but i was attracted by the workflow but not sure if it is a big upgrade

Top contenders

1. Mazzer Philos with the 1200D Burr. Love the tank like build quality and seems like it will last a lot longer than other competitors but the footprint does seem quite large at nearly 14 x 14 inches height and depth. Wish i could've bought this a while back before the price hike. Now it is reaching the territory of the lagom 80 and zerno z2 at current price
2. Lagom P80, not a fan of the long wait time but very interested in prosumer 80mm flat burrs to see if that would bring any noticeable difference to taste. Looks pretty sleek as well and i'm hearing good things about noise level too. Not sure how lagom support/warranty would work though through option-o since they seem to release new models all the time and discontinue production for their older models
3. Zerno Z2. pushing the budget a little bit but not sure if zerno has slightly better build than the lagom?
4. I've also considered a GBW for the streamlined workflow and looked particularly at the Fiorenzato Allground Sense but worried about many reviewers online citing issues with the near 4-6g retention per grind which is absurdly high, and probably worse if switching back and forth between espresso/filter.

open to other suggestions too even if cheaper since would pocket whatever savings i can to buy more coffee gear and maybe push for a new espresso machine.",1,1765823996.0,espresso,6,1.0,False

I think that I read 2 hours quickly long ago and misunderstood, but latched onto that time. I know that studied information and constrains vs. what works for your family is also different, PLUS the type of content and way its consumed are also factors that we don't have studies for. Like we don't have studies of 2, 3, or 4 hours of high quality, educational and shared with an adult content vs. the 1 hour? 

  
Also, I sort of have anxiety about my infant being exposed to any screens before the age of 18 months because the guidelines say NONE, but again, that's probably just easier to create a guideline for than to create studied increments of exposure? 

I catch my infant looking at the TV while my toddler is watching and feel guilty. 

 ""Screen time guidelines vary by age, generally recommending **no screens for babies (except video calls), up to 1 hour daily for preschoolers (co-viewed), and focusing on quality/balance (around 2 hrs) for older kids/teens**, prioritizing sleep, activity, and real-world interaction over strict hour limits for school-age groups, according to [AAP](https://www.aap.org/en/patient-care/media-and-children/center-of-excellence-on-social-media-and-youth-mental-health/qa-portal/qa-portal-library/qa-portal-library-questions/screen-time-for-infants/) and other experts like [AACAP](https://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Facts_for_Families/FFF-Guide/Children-And-Watching-TV-054.aspx). For older children (6+) and teens, focus shifts to **healthy habits, screen-free bedrooms, avoiding screens before bed, and balancing with homework/play**, notes CHLA.""

  
What have you done with your kids and what has the outcome been? My kids are 5 months and 3.5 years old.

My 3.5 year old has 2 hours of educational, low stim, and engaging content, like Lucas the Spider, Sesame Street, but will watch Danny Go to dance and burn some energy. I'm usually always in the room and actively dancing, singing, or discussing / chiming in about the show with him. We then watch the news throughout the day (is this screen time? if he isn't really actively consuming it?), and we will do a family movie while we eat dinner, which i'm trying to reduce to Fridays only, but for now, it's a nightly thing, especially around the Holidays. 

  
On weekends he watches way more TV than I'd like to admit. Saturdays he watches 2 hours of cartoons with his Dad in the morning, then has his 2 hours of his chosen educational show at some point in the day, and then a family movie at night / news. I feel guilty because I'm really noticing how other kids are reactive, impulsive, lack independent and imaginative play, and also have behavioral issues and my kids DOES not have issues in these categories., but the data says 1 hour or less, and i'm doing two. 

My toddler can just sit in the car for an hour and look out the window, loves books, knows boudaries, loves music, animals, and building / tinkering with things. 

  
We don't believe in him having access to portable screens and live by the principle that the screen he has acesss to is stationary and the portable screen content is viewed with us on our phones only, and that's mostly face-time and music, or reels about elephants and horses.

I'm wondering if I should cut back on his 2 hours per day / weekend family TV time with us?   
I want to implement more family sit down table dinners, but we sit down around the living room coffee table and eat together while catching the news, and I think that's okay too? ",5,1765823776.0,Parenting,18,0.73,False

I used to work in an office environment with a lot of peers and it was awesome. I really liked going out to grab a coffee with a coworker and talking about random things, sometimes getting deeper, and forming friendships. There was something really special about having some good chats and support throughout the work day, even if I had other relationships/friendships in my life.

I've since moved jobs and while there are many improvements, I haven't found the same level of friendships, and the job can be quite isolating. It would be lovely to make a few, even virtually.

Friendships are really important in both good times and bad times, and I would be grateful for the opportunity to be able to support one another. Truth be told that this year has been quite difficult for me, but I think that is all the more reason to pursue more meaningful friendships.

The most important thing to me in the conversations would be honesty and consistency. It would be great to receive that, and I would be happy to do the same.

1pnf529,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1pnf529/sticky_notes/,Sticky notes,"I’m posting this here because I don’t know where else to put it, and because if I don’t write it down I’m scared I’ll start convincing myself it never happened.

Last winter, I started losing time. Not blackouts exactly—more like gaps that felt edited out, the way a bad streaming app skips ten seconds and pretends nothing’s wrong. I’d notice small things first. A chair moved. My phone unlocked with no memory of doing it. Mud on my shoes even though I hadn’t gone outside. I live alone, so I blamed stress, sleep deprivation, maybe some dissociative thing I didn’t want to Google because Google always tells you you’re dying.

Then I found the notes.

They were written on sticky notes in my handwriting, stuck to places I’d definitely look: the bathroom mirror, the inside of the fridge, my laptop screen. Short, blunt sentences.
DO NOT FALL ASLEEP AFTER 1:43 AM.
CHECK THE CLOSET BEFORE BED.
IT CAN HEAR YOU THINK.

I laughed at first. Nervous laugh. Sleepwalking prank on myself, right? Except the ink was always fresh. And I don’t own sticky notes. I hate them. They leave residue.

The first night I decided to stay awake and catch myself in the act, I made coffee and sat on my bed scrolling Reddit until my eyes burned. At 1:42 AM, my phone buzzed. A reminder notification popped up. I don’t remember setting it.

LOCK THE DOOR. NOW.

I stood up and froze because the bedroom door was already locked. The deadbolt, too. I never use the deadbolt inside. I don’t even remember installing it.

At 1:43 AM, the feeling started.

It wasn’t a sound exactly. More like pressure. The way your ears feel when you’re underwater too long and your body starts panicking before your brain does. My head throbbed, and a thought slid into my mind that wasn’t shaped like my thoughts usually are. It was flat. Heavy. Crowded.

Don’t turn around.

I turned around.

My closet door was open a crack. Just enough to show darkness that didn’t match the rest of the room. It wasn’t shadows—it was absence, like someone had erased part of the world. I stared at it, and the longer I did, the more wrong my body felt. My teeth buzzed. My tongue went numb. I had the overwhelming certainty that if I blinked, something would step closer.

Another thought pressed into my skull, sharper this time.

We practiced this.

I whispered, “Practiced what?” and immediately regretted it. The darkness in the closet shifted, like something adjusting its posture. Not stepping out. Getting comfortable.

I woke up on the kitchen floor at 6:48 AM with dried blood under my nails and my phone crushed in my hand. The front door was wide open. Snow covered the floor in footprints that led inside, circled the kitchen, and went back out.

All of them were mine.

Barefoot.

I should’ve gone to the hospital. I didn’t. Instead, I checked my laptop, desperate for proof that I was losing it. My phone had backed itself up at 1:44 AM.

There was a video.

It showed me standing in front of the closet, smiling in a way that hurt to look at, whispering over and over, “Next time, you come all the way out. I’m tired of doing this part for you.”

I haven’t slept past 1:43 AM since.

The sticky notes still appear.

And every night, the closet door opens a little wider—like it’s learning how much room it needs.",2,1765823700.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

Harvey Specter would be that senior partner at a Tier-1 firm who gets featured in Legal Era every year, bills ₹5 lakhs per hour, and makes associates rewrite memos at 11 PM because ""the formatting isn't consistent."" Corner office at Nariman Point. Tom Ford suits.

Mike Ross would be that smart kid from Lloyd Law College or Amity who didn't get into NLUs but is genuinely brilliant. Self-taught, reads cases like novels, somehow knows more than people from top colleges. The associate who reads every document, finds that one problematic SHA clause at 3 AM, and saves the deal. Survives on black coffee and Haldiram's packets. His screen always has 47 Excel tabs open.

Jessica Pearson would be founding partner at a breakaway firm. Left a legacy firm in 2015, took half the partners and the entire PE practice, built something bigger in 5 years. On every ""Top Women Lawyers"" list, quoted in ET and Mint for big deals, speaks at FICCI, advises government committees. Still bills 1,500 hours. Wears Sabyasachi to client meetings.

Louis Litt would be that partner nobody wants to work with but is genuinely brilliant. Obsessed with billable hours (tracks them on color-coded Excel), sends 6:30 AM emails, remembers every mistake from 2 years ago. Collects Mont Blanc pens, talks about his NLSIU rank too much, has strong opinions on which associates ""have it.""

Rachel Zane would be working at the firm while preparing for judiciary because she ""wants to make a real difference."" Smart, hardworking, everyone likes her. Eventually cracks judicial services or moves in-house with better work-life balance. Actually logs out at 8 PM sometimes.

Donna Paulsen would be the EA who's been with the senior partner for 15 years and runs everything. Knows which client called when, which associate is reliable for weekend work, which partner shouldn't be disturbed, where every document version is saved. Gets paid more than second-years and deserves it. Saved a deal once by remembering a conversation from 6 months ago.

Robert Zane would head disputes at a top firm. Supreme Court, High Courts, DIAC, SIAC, ICC arbitrations - argued everything. Has 35 years experience, argued before 9-judge benches, gets briefed by Senior Counsel for strategy.  
Speaks at SCBA events, writes in SCC Online, trains associates on weekends. Charges ₹10 lakhs per hearing. Worth every paisa.

I’ve noticed a lot of posts on here from people in Leeds who want to meet people or make friends, but find big meetups or event-style groups a bit overwhelming or hit-and-miss. 

I’ll be honest, I’m in that camp too. There was a reddit post yesterday to meet up in town and though I was keen, I chickened out. I just wasn’t up to it on the day, which got me thinking that it might help to have a gentler space where people can talk first, get comfortable, and then decide if they want to meet up.

I’ve put together a small Discord called Leeds Chat & Chill for people who want a friendly place to chat, get to know people at their own pace, and optionally meet up later.

It’s:

\- Leeds-based

\- 18+( purely to keep moderation simple and conversations age appropriate. It's not a dating or adult-content server)

\- Very low pressure ( lurking is completely fine)

\- NOT a dating server

\- Nerd friendly but not exclusive

\- Actively moderated with basic automoderation to keep it respectful and non-toxic.

There are channels for general chat, games (tabletop & video), books/films/TV, food & Leeds Restaurant recommendations, what’s on in the city, and a low-pressure “looking for company” channel for things like coffee, walks, or board games.

I want to be clear about one thing up front:

this isn’t me trying to organise events, fix loneliness, or run a big community. I’m not a social organiser or a support service. I’m just someone who wanted a calmer place to chat, meet people and connect, and thought others might feel the same.

The idea is that this space could work because everyone helps keep it friendly, respectful, and low-pressure. I’ve set some clear rules and basic moderation, and if people have suggestions or want to help out down the line, they’re welcome to reach out but the aim is shared responsibility, not one person running everything. I'm just trying to do a good thing and hopefully find some friends of my own here.

If that sounds like your kind of thing, you’re very welcome to join: https://discord.gg/XKmQFknmFP

If not, no worries at all. Just wanted to share in case it helps someone else who’s looking for something a bit gentler to get their foot through the door",9,1765823131.0,Leeds,7,0.7,False

1pneuh5,https://www.reddit.com/r/VyvanseADHD/comments/1pneuh5/how_it_feels_to_quit_vyvanse/,How it feels to quit vyvanse,"Hey guys! Just sharing my experience on here about quitting vyvanse.

TLDR; sleepy first couple of days and by day 5 back to normal yay!

I’m 20, and have taken 50mg for a year. I took some 2-3 day breaks at the start, but vyvanse messes with my sleep so bad that every time I took a break I would sleep for ages and then not sleep at all once I started taking it again. So since June (6 months) I’ve basically not taken any breaks (if I had, they were probably max 1 day and I can’t remember). 

I just had my exam period in uni and it went to shit! I did not get a grade above a D. Which is so sad because I worked so hard. I feel like my memory has gotten really bad because of vyvanse messing with my sleep and I can barely remember anything anymore. I’m just tired of needing so perfect conditions for it to work properly. So I went «cold turkey» and stopped taking it 5 days ago. 

For anyone who is in a similar situation, here’s my experience of the past few days! I also stopped caffeine and mega reduced nicotine intake (the deadly trio, but I always craved other stimulants more when I was on vyvanse.) so the sleepiness was probably also due to that!

Day 1: slept 12 hours. Woke up at 12pm and couldn’t do anything. Only felt alive when I ate something. Literally just watched my phone all day and felt so fuzzy and dysfunctional. Fell asleep at 8pm.

Day 2: woke up at 3pm - slept 20 hours! Insane. Was still so sleepy once I woke up. And only managed to stay awake 3 hours before I passed out again. Fell asleep at 6pm

Day 3: woke up at 8am, with many alarms. Drank a monster. Had made plans with a friend at 10, so I showered and got ready. Was so zombie when I met her. Then I went and ate lunch with some other friends. I was literally falling asleep. I felt like I was not fully there the entire time, a sense of derealization, like out of body feeling. It was so strange. And i really struggled to keep my eyes open, they felt so heavy. I got home at 2pm and just watched more tv coz I couldn’t be assed to do anything else. But still couldn’t fall asleep until 3am, which was weird! I deadass just ate and watched TVD the entire day.

Day 4: woke up at 3pm, and had to clean my apartment bc it’s my turn (I live with roommates). And I immediately started cleaning the second I woke up because I had plans for dinner at 5.30pm. Did not go on my phone or listen to music, just cleaned right off the bat. Then got ready super quick, got pizza and met my friends for dinner. Got home at 7pm ish and took the trash out, finished cleaning and chilled. I felt a lot more like myself! But fell asleep at 2am:(

Day 5 (today!): woke up at 8am, set an alarm! Bc I had a few meetings today. I showered, did my hair and makeup, and put my bedsheets to wash. Also had a big-ish coffee. Met with my college advisor at 11am, and ate lunch with friends at 12.15ish. Then had a doc appt at 1.20pm. Got home at around 3, and cleaned my room! I feel so normal, I almost feel like I’ve taken a vyvanse today. It’s now 7pm, and I’ve just watched TVD, but I also managed to edit a video I’ve been meaning to do for a while! I didnt finish but got through some of it. But I genuinely feel so good right now! Like it’s all washed away for some reason.

I deadass thought that vyvanse would fully destroy my brain forever and I would take years to recover but I already feel like myself after a few days off it! I think that people maybe dramatisize how bad it is, but then again, I was on a medium size dose and not for that long. But I might start up again on like 30mg if uni gets bad, I just don’t think it’s helping my memory at all, which has always been my priority. I think that doomscrolling adds to the memory loss feeling, because I genuinely feel like my brain is empty. So I want to try watching more shows (if I must go on my phone) and then eventually reading more, studying for fun, deleting TikTok and stop reels scrolling. I think that fucks me up pretty bad. Also just going on my phone first thing in the morning ruins my day always! So I hope that I continue to feel better but I genuinely think I’m back to how I used to be, which is so nice!

So I use to be a contract/gig worker. In my industry we ended up in a lot of temporary offices. Places that were either vacant or not being used daily before we moved in for a few months, did our thing and then packed up and moved out. 

I was hired onto a job and began to process of moving into our temporary office space along with around 20 other people. It was an old warehouse that had been empty for sometime before we moved in.

Anyway. So were unpacking and setting up and of course priority #1 is the coffee pot, but priority #2 was wifi. As this was an older building there was no established network connection to just turn on in our name, so managment decided to get us these little data hot spot things to plug into each general area.

Apparently when activating such things you can select different levels of data usage for different prices. And managment, in their ultimate wisdom, did not only not choose the unlimited version, but chose the cheapest and smallest amout of data possible. 

For an office of 20 people that would all be there 8+ hours a day for months.... (oh and they didnt think to tell us this fact. Just told us wifi was up and running). 

I'm not sure how much data they actually paid for that first day but the wifi stopped working AN HOUR after it was connected. 

A lot of hemming and hawing and back and forth about ""well how much do you think well actually use on a daily basis"" managment finally sucked it up and paid for the unlimited version. 

It took them 3 days to reach that conclusion.

It was a log, written in precise, block lettering, detailing my schedule, my habits, the times I showered, the times I left for groceries, and lists of items he intended to ""borrow."" The author was identified as Daniel Vane, a framing contractor who had worked on the development six months prior and had been fired for sleeping on the job sites. He had built the room during the construction phase, framing the hidden door and dry-walling over it before the painters arrived, effectively sealing himself into the architecture of the house. He had been living there since before I closed on the property, surviving on stolen food from the other empty houses and, eventually, my own pantry.  
  
They didn't catch him that night. He had slipped out through a secondary exit he had cut into the attic gable, dropping onto the soft earth of the backyard and disappearing into the woods before the perimeter was established. The police told me it was safe, that he wouldn't come back now that his nest was discovered, but I couldn't stay. I moved into a hotel the next morning, leaving the La Marzocco and the furniture behind.  
  
Two weeks later, they found Vane. He hadn't gone far. He was arrested in the next housing development over, five miles south, where a new family had just reported hearing footsteps in their attic and finding their thermostat set to seventy-two degrees. When they handcuffed him, he was wearing my missing heavy wool coat and had my 10mm socket in his pocket, turning it over and over in his fingers like a worry stone. The detective told me Vane confessed immediately, stating calmly that he simply preferred the new construction homes because the insulation was better and the owners were usually too distracted by the flaws in the paint to notice the extra square footage that didn't appear on the blueprints.  
  
I sold the house at a loss to an investment firm three months later. I never went back inside to pack; I hired movers to do it and instructed them to burn the mattress and the bedding. I live in a pre-war apartment building in the city now, a place with solid brick walls and no cavities deep enough to hide a man. But every time I lose a key or a pen, every time the floor creaks in the night, I freeze, waiting for the sound of a hidden latch clicking open, wondering if the blueprints of this building are as accurate as I hope they are. The police report stated that Vane had modified three other homes in the county before mine, but they only found evidence of habitation in two. Somewhere, in a house with fresh siding and a ten-year warranty, there is a room that doesn't exist on paper, and someone is waiting for the new owners to buy the wrong brand of coffee.",1,1765822778.0,u_Sea-Till2020,0,1.0,False

1pneo7v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sephora/comments/1pneo7v/i_cant_stand_the_summer_fridays_lip_balm/,I can’t stand the Summer Fridays lip balm,"Usually, I see people say you’re an Ole Henriksen lip balm girly or a Summer Fridays girly. Boy, is this accurate! I have bought multiple Ole lip peptides over the past year and a half, it’s my ride or die. It’s expensive for a lip balm, but that stuff works within a single application. Colors are pretty too! But I wanted to try the Summer Fridays, especially the Iced Coffee, Poppy and Cherry shades since I don’t see many lip balm formulas in those unique shades. 

I’m not joking, on the SF lip balm first application it felt like I was putting oil on my lips. Maybe not gisou olive oil, but it didn’t feel like the typical, moisturizing lip balm. My lips felt a little hydrated, but it wore off my lips very quickly (even without eating, it could come off when sipping drinks with a straw). I remember applying it before bed some nights and it felt that it has disappeared off my lips maybe a half hour after. My lips started to peel slightly (I stopped using other lip balms just to test a hypothesis that it was the SF lip balm damaging my lips). My lips never peeled with Ole, Laneige, Eadem, Topicals, etc. 

I know everyone is different, including their opinions on what works best for them, but the SF lip is on no level close to Ole. The only thing I liked about SF was the shade range (I also liked the scents, they’re not as strong as Ole). But, in case you were thinking of trying the Iced Coffee lip balm from SF, beware the scent is more caramel than anything. Maybe I got a bad batch, but that lip tasted nor smelled like coffee, even in the slightest. They should re name it “caramel”. 

I hope this helps you Sephora shoppers during this shopping season! Or if you’re trying something new :) 

TLDR Summer Fridays is in no way comparable to 
Ole lip balms, the SF made my lips peel which didn’t happen with other lip brands. The SF shades are pretty and not as strong as other brands (looking at you Ole) but the Iced Coffee is nothing like cofffee.

1pnenxw,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Sea-Till2020/comments/1pnenxw/3/,3,"The camera mounted above the workbench showed the garage clearly, the shadows deep and sharp, and in the corner of the frame, near the large industrial shelving unit where I stored bulk parts, a section of the drywall was moving. It wasn't a subtle shift; a rectangular section of the wall, roughly two feet by three feet, was pivoting inward on a hidden hinge, dissolving the seam between the panels perfectly. I watched, breath held in my throat, as a pair of legs emerged from the void, clad in dirty cargo pants and heavy work boots, followed by a torso wrapped in a dark hoodie. The figure lowered itself to the floor with a practiced, silent agility, avoiding the squeaky floorboard near the heater that I always stepped on. The intruder didn't look around wildly; he moved with the confidence of a resident, walking straight to my workbench, picking up a specific screwdriver, and then walking out of the frame toward the door that led into the house kitchen.  
  
I was in the bedroom upstairs, watching this on my phone with a delay of maybe ten seconds. I didn't scream. I didn't run. A cold, reptilian paralysis took hold of my limbs as I realized the ""glitch"" in the lock I had experienced weeks ago wasn't a glitch—he had unlocked it from the inside. I heard the soft, almost imperceptible click of the door at the bottom of the stairs opening, followed by the muffled compression of the carpet on the steps. He was coming up. I locked the bedroom door, a hollow-core interior slab that would offer zero resistance to a determined attacker, and dialed 911 again, whispering the situation to the operator, telling her there was a man in the house, that he had come out of the walls. She told me to barricade myself and stay on the line, her voice tight with the sudden escalation of the call.  
  
I dragged the heavy oak dresser across the hardwood floor, the screech of the legs deafening in the silence, and shoved it against the door. The footsteps on the stairs stopped instantly. Silence stretched for ten seconds, twenty, thirty. Then, the doorknob jiggled, a gentle, inquisitive rotation, back and forth. A voice, low and raspy, dry from breathing insulation dust and recycled air, spoke through the wood. ""You changed the brand of coffee,"" it said. ""I liked the dark roast better."" Then came the sound of retreating footsteps, slow and deliberate, going back down the stairs, not running, just walking away.  
  
The police arrived in force this time, four cars screeching into the cul-de-sac, sirens cutting the night. I stayed in the room until they cleared the lower level, their shouts of ""Police! Show us your hands!"" echoing through the ductwork. When I finally came downstairs, wrapped in a blanket, the house was ablaze with tactical lights. They took me to the garage, where two officers were standing by the shelving unit, their guns drawn and pointed at the black hole in the wall. The hidden door was open.  
  
The investigation that followed over the next forty-eight hours unraveled a narrative that was far more disturbing than a simple break-in. The space behind the wall wasn't just a void; it was a fully finished, unauthorized room, sandwiched between the garage wall and the pantry of the main house, a dead space created by the intersection of the rooflines that shouldn't have been accessible. Inside, the police found a twin mattress stolen from a model home down the street, a camping stove, a bucket used as a latrine, and a stack of my missing tools, arranged neatly on a makeshift shelf. They also found a tapping device connected to my internet cable, explaining the spotty wifi, and a small monitor hardwired into the feeds of the very security cameras I had installed. He hadn't just been hiding; he had been watching me watch him.
