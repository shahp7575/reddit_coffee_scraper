I am married with a daughter. My husband is an alcoholic who spends pretty much his free time sitting and watching TV either drinking coffee, soda, or alcohol. My first husband was abusive and once we got divorced, married his AP. My mother and brother have narcissist tendencies and I'm the one they gang up on. I try so hard for my daughter to be present and for her to not have to fight the same demons I have. I am currently working with a therapist but it doesn't feel like I'm getting better. I'm taking my meds. I'm exercising and trying to eat healthy. I am successful in my job. I dont have any friends that I talk to. If it wasn't for my work or my daughter, I really wouldn't talk to anyone. Howeve by outside appearance, my life is fantastic. But each day, I die a bit more. My loneliness takes a fraction more of my soul.  I just want someone who will care for me and tell me it will be okay. Who wants to talk to me and hear about my day, good, bad or otherwise. Who doesn't walk away when I try to talk about my feelings. But most of all, I don't want my daughter to ever have to fight this hell. Depression is a hell of a disease.

## What to Look for in the Perfect “Blend On The Water” Cordless Blender

Not all cordless blenders are created equal. When selecting the best portable blender for your “blend on the water” lifestyle, consider these key factors:

*   **Power:** A powerful portable blender is crucial, especially if you plan on blending ice, frozen fruit, or tough ingredients commonly used in smoothies and cocktails.Look for models with high wattage or robust motor performance. Don’t be fooled by compact size – some pack a serious punch!
*   **Battery Life:** The longer the battery life, the better. You don't want your blender dying halfway through making a batch of margaritas for your guests. Check the manufacturer's specifications for blending time and charging time. Consider purchasing a second battery for extended blending sessions.
*   **Water Resistance/Waterproof rating:** This is paramount for a “blend on the water” scenario. Look for blenders specifically designed to withstand splashes, spills, and even occasional immersion in water. A waterproof blender will protect the motor and electronics from damage.
*   **Durability:** Your blender will likely be subjected to bumps, drops, and exposure to the elements. Choose a model made from durable materials like Tritan plastic or stainless steel.
*   **Portability:** Consider the weight and size of the blender. Is it easy to carry in a beach bag or store in a boat compartment? Look for models with carrying handles or straps.
*   **Blending Capabilities:** Does it excel at making smoothies, cocktails, or both? Consider the types of drinks you plan on making most often. A versatile cocktail blender should be able to crush ice efficiently. A good smoothie blender will create a smooth, lump-free texture.
*   **Ease of Cleaning:** No one wants to spend hours cleaning a blender after a fun day on the water. Look for models with detachable blades and dishwasher-safe parts. Self-cleaning functions are a bonus!
*   **Safety Features:** Overload protection, automatic shut-off, and child safety locks are important safety features to consider.
*   **Price:** Cordless blenders can range in price from budget-kind to premium. Determine your budget and compare features and performance within that range.

## Maximizing Your “Blend On The Water” Experience: Tips & Tricks

Now that you’ve chosen the perfect cordless blender, here are some tips and tricks to help you make the most of your “blend on the water” experience:

*   **Pre-Chill Ingredients:** Whenever possible, chill your fruits, vegetables, and liquids before blending. This will help your blender work more efficiently and produce colder, more refreshing drinks.
*   **Cut Ingredients into smaller Pieces:** Cutting ingredients into smaller pieces will reduce the strain on your blender's motor and ensure smoother blending.
*   **Add Liquid First:** Adding liquid to the blender jar before adding solid ingredients will help create a vortex and prevent the blades from getting stuck.
*   **Don't Overfill the Blender:** overfilling the blender can cause leaks and strain the motor. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for maximum fill levels.
*   **Pulse Blending:** Use the pulse function to start blending thicker ingredients or to crush ice. This will help prevent the blades from getting stuck.
*   **Clean Immediately After Use:** Cleaning your blender immediately after use will prevent food particles from drying and becoming difficult to remove.
*   **Store Properly:** Store your blender in a cool, dry place. Avoid storing it in direct sunlight or extreme temperatures.
*   **Utilize Ice Wisely:** If your blender struggles with large ice cubes, try using crushed ice or smaller ice cubes. You can also add a small amount of water to help facilitate blending.
*   **Experiment with Recipes:** Don't be afraid to experiment with different recipes and ingredients. Get creative and find your perfect “blend on the water” concoctions! Consider using locally sourced fruits when possible, especially if you are blending while traveling.
*   **Consider a Portable Power Bank:** Even with long battery life, a portable power bank can be a lifesaver for extended blending sessions, especially when you're far from a power source.

Had a very high maintenance guest come through. We provide a crib for babies. She said she had two babies when she reserved and I asked if she could like two cribs. She said yes, so I ordered a second crib and high chair specifically for her. They were $180 (we try to go for quality stuff).

We assembled the cribs and high chairs and left them where she wanted them, and w/ every visit we leave a hand written note thanking them for choosing our airbnb w/ a pack of coffee and a bottle of local wine as a nice gesture.

When she checks in she found dirt on the balcony and a hair on the floor. The hair on the floor surprised me because we are pretty fanatical about cleaning and have a special process to tackle hairs and even do a inspection after each cleaning w/ photos to make sure things are super clean and have evidence in case we ever need it.

But regardless, we sent someone to go clean right away and had the cleaner spent 3 hours sweeping and mopping and detailing everything she could while the guest was away. I explained to the guest there is wind and plants on the balcony so it's natural that some dirt will fall to floor of the balcony. It was really like a few specs of dirt from the photo I saw. 

Guest wants late checkout, I did everything I could to accommodate and moved back the cleaning by 1 hour. I don't charge her anything.  She leaves food on the stove, dirty plates everywhere, I find a pillow broken, stains on the curtains, and of course she has kids and didn't really clean up after them.

Leaves a very nice review, says it's a gem of a place, but gives us 4 stars on cleanliness.

Really frustrating to see. Any suggestions on how to handle this situation going forward.

I've been leaving all my guests 5 stars, even the ones that are hard to deal with but I think it may be better to start rating the difficult ones a lot lower.",2,1742140419.0,airbnb_hosts,5,0.75,False

✅ Vote & comment on noise levels, seating, Wi-Fi, and overall vibe

1jcofk3,https://i.redd.it/rqs4waf7p2pe1.jpeg,Sunday Palencia Reserva Original at the lounge,"Plasencia Reserva Original Review

The Plasencia Reserva Original is an exceptional cigar that blends tradition, sustainability, and quality craftsmanship. It is notable for being one of the world’s first certified organic cigars, made entirely from Nicaraguan tobacco cultivated without pesticides or artificial fertilizers.

Appearance & Construction

The Reserva Original is a beautifully crafted cigar with a smooth, slightly oily wrapper that has a light brown, almost caramel-like hue. The construction is flawless, with minimal veins and a firm but not overly tight pack. The cap cuts cleanly, and the draw is consistently smooth throughout the smoke.

Cold Draw & Aroma

Before lighting, the cold draw offers notes of sweet earth, cedar, and a touch of dried fruit, particularly raisins or figs. The aroma from the wrapper has hints of hay, cocoa, and a slight nuttiness.

Flavor Profile

First Third: The cigar starts off mild to medium-bodied, with an immediate presence of natural sweetness, cedar, and a bit of spice—reminiscent of white pepper. There are also subtle notes of nuts and cocoa, making for a well-balanced introduction.

Second Third: As the cigar progresses, the sweetness remains but is complemented by creamy and bready notes, giving it a smooth, almost dessert-like quality. Hints of cinnamon and toasted almonds become more apparent, adding complexity.

Final Third: The body leans more toward medium as more earthy and woody elements emerge. There’s a pleasant espresso-like bitterness that balances the sweetness, along with a lingering nuttiness. The finish is clean and satisfying.


Burn & Performance

The burn is razor-sharp, with a consistent white ash that holds well. The draw is effortless, producing ample smoke output. The cigar remains cool throughout, never turning harsh or bitter.

Overall Impression

The Plasencia Reserva Original is an excellent choice for those who appreciate a smooth, flavorful cigar without overwhelming strength. Its organic origins add a unique appeal, making it a great option for aficionados who value natural purity in their smokes. While mild to medium-bodied, it offers enough complexity to keep seasoned smokers engaged while remaining approachable for newcomers.

Pairing Suggestions: Enjoy this cigar with a mild coffee (americano was my choic), a smooth bourbon, or a light white wine to enhance its natural sweetness.",4,1742140186.0,cigar,0,1.0,False

Here’s how the conversation went.

Me:”Mom, I really don’t mind that you bring three 2-liters of soda pop to the house and put in the fridge for your visits. But if you leave them behind, I am not going to keep them in the fridge. I’m going to dump them out because I don’t want the kids drinking them.”

BoomerMom:”Well…I had PLENTY of things in the fridge when YOU were a kid that YOU were not allowed to have. But YOU understood the word, NO.”

Me:”OK, well, Mom, I just don’t see the point in keeping something the kids love in the fridge and then denying them access to it. Besides, it’s not good for anyone anyway. Pop is hard on your teeth and it’s just sugar and calories.” 

BoomerMom:”Tell them NO. All of your problems are because you are INCAPABLE of telling your children NO. I had no problem keeping things in the fridge.”

Me:”OK, that was your life. This is my life. I do things differently.”

BoomerMom:”Don’t you DARE get shitty with me! I will give it right back to you!! I’m not in the mood for your crap!”

Me: “Um…ok? I’m not getting shitty with you. I’m using a normal tone of voice and speaking on a very logical point?”

BoomerMom:”WHATEVER!”

I then sighed and told her she was hateful. She didn’t talk to me the whole care ride home. She then ran away to my brother’s house, bourbon in hand. 

This all came about because my mom brings unhealthy soda pops to my house so she can have mixer for her bourbon. She also regularly consumes pop like water is poison. She is overweight and has struggled with her weight her whole life. She had bariatric surgery a decade ago and eats like a child. She does not take any vitamins like her doctor told her to. She is basically starving herself and still managing to gain weight. She wakes up, drinks a pot of coffee, then starts in on mimosas. By afternoon, she is fiending for a bourbon and mixer. 

Is it lead poisoning, emotional abuse from childhood, or nutritional
deficits that cause her to be such a damn boomer? ",11,1742139570.0,BoomersBeingFools,15,1.0,False

1. Is anyone regularly using the Micra’s hot water tap instead of a kettle to quickly make tea?

Does this actually work well, or is it not ideal for everyday tea-making?

About a month into my injury, I got money for my birthday and used it to buy the BAGGU Horizontal Duck Bag. I LOVED it and it's been absolutely perfect. It's even nice to carry out when I go to try and do activates.

However, I've spilled coffee on it and it's not going to come out. It's really bad and it's a cream colored bag.

I'm going to try and save up for another one, but it also made me curious if there are bags similar that can hold my clothes and medical supplies and have more fun patterns?

I'm not a fan of backpacks as they're took bulky when I lie it flat in my lap and it's hard if I try to go shopping and is too bulky. 

Any suggestions? I do like tote bags like the BAGGU and it zips closed and has an extra pocket for my wallet.  ",1,1742139273.0,HerOneBag,1,1.0,False
1jco3cb,https://www.reddit.com/r/bahamas/comments/1jco3cb/harbour_island_day_trip_from_new_providencenassau/,Harbour Island Day Trip from New Providence/Nassau,"I'm sharing this as I wish it was there for me when planning my day trip to Harbour Island. In short, it is a must, even if yes, the ferry takes three hours one way and costs about $515 for two people. The sand is PINK. The water is crystal clear turquoise (on March 15), there are delicious fish tacos, lobster rolls, beers and cocktails etc. for sale at TeeJay's right on pink sands beach. Veg and gf options are limited, but there is guac and chips for sale--bringing your own snacks to round out your meal is always a good idea! You leave at 8:00, arrive about 10:30, and depart at 3:40, getting back to Nassau around 6:30. You can park for free at the ferry station if you get there early and find a spot. The woman at the ticket check in was helpful and showed us where. We were not staying near the ferry port, so had a rental car to drive/park. 

I've seen other folks complain about the ferry ride, but for us--just two adults--we read our books and gazed at the ocean and it was fine. You can sit inside the cabin with a/c or outside with plastic windows to keep the water from splashing on you. Note that the motor sounds are loud on the ferry and the outside seating had a bit of a gasoline smell that did get to me after awhile, but inside the cabin this wasn't an issue. You do need to board early to get an inside cabin seat as most of them are reserved and only a few are available for the ""cheap"" seat ticket holders. The snacks/drinks are not too expensive ($2 for soft drinks, water, coffee, tea). The bathrooms are fine--definitely not as disgusting as other boat bathrooms I've encountered. DO bring your ID (license is fine, no need for passport) or you can't board. 

Ideally i would have printed or downloaded a map of Harbour Island and marked where TeeJays is, but it is easy to find and the local folks are helpful and ready to point you in the right direction. 

When you get to Harbour Island, hop off the boat, and head UP the first street you see in front of you. Going left or right will take you to town, but UP and over the hill will take you right to pink sands beach. You do NOT need to rent a golf cart--the walk is about .5 miles. Yes, it is up a steep hill, but doable. At the beach, locate TeeJay's and rent chairs with an umbrella ($25 for 2--CASH ONLY). Though this area is right in front of a few hotels, it wasn't particularly crowded. The worst thing was the entitled American teenagers being a bit loud/not caring where they were tossing their football around, even if it was basically at you. But really, no biggie. TeeJays's has delicious food--just bring cash. I'd say $150 would be enough for chairs, a meal, and 1-2 cocktails ($15), or beers ($8). There are restaurants that take cards right up from the beach as well, but we wanted to spend as much time on the beach as possible. There is a small changing closet attached to TeeJays that has a shower. Bathrooms require going to one of the restaurants, so go before you leave the boat. 

  
The sand is PINK--especially when the bright sun hits it. The water is turquoise, and the undertow/waves were gentle in comparison to east coast/Carolinas beaches that I'm used to. There is a horseback riding outfit right behind TeeJays, but I do not know the cost. In contrast to another review I read, I think Harbour Island is very worth it and I'm going to try to go again--perhaps stay at Northern Eleuthera on our next trip and take the short water taxi to Harbour for the day as rentals are pretty $$$ on Harbour itself. A general bahamas tip is to pack snack foods as they are $$$ on the island grocery stores. I mostly wish I had brought a big bag of nuts and more protein bars. Have fun!

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1jcnv8q,https://i.redd.it/bzqx72apk2pe1.jpeg,A tale of two shitties,"Preface: these tats were close to 20 years apart. First shitty tat is my MOB. Got it when I was 19 and in the marine corps by someone’s cousin staying in On Base Housing. I was like 19 and kinda drunk. It was the mid 2000s  I loved (still do) the dirty south hip hop from that time period and ig IYKYK. Not a gang tat*. Story two: I have gotten many tats since MOB including a full sleeve on my other side with some work that I love. I have never let the lesson of the MOB tat (don’t let amateurs tattoo you and don’t let other people talk you into it). Fast forward around 20 years. It’s Friday the 13th my wife and SIL are coming back from Dutch bros (coffee) place about these $13 tattoos from the shop that their barista was an apprentice at. So after spending half the day playfully mocking them they finally recruit me in to going with them to the shop. I start looking at the flash and there’s this cool little chicken. I figure $13 and I’m planning my left sleeve anyway so I can cover it up. They both get theirs done and it’s nice work (again small simple lines). I get the barista apprentice and not only is this what I ended up with at one point her gun skipped and I ended up with a small line (gone since) on my hand. 

TLDR: don’t get tatted at someone’s house @ 19, and don’t fall for peer pressure",3,1742138668.0,shittytattoos,3,1.0,False

1jcnsxv,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1jcnsxv/weekly_crowdfunding_roundup_march_16_2025_23/,"Weekly Crowdfunding Roundup: March 16, 2025 | 23 ending soon (""Tiny Epic Dungeons Adventures"", ""Blasphemous: The Board Game"") & 45 new (""Formaggio"", ""Rome: Fate of an Empire"")","## What is this?

This is a weekly roundup of board game crowdfunding projects, featuring new launches from the past week and campaigns ending in the coming week. The information is sourced from Kickstarter, Gamefound, and Backerkit.

The list is curated through a combination of automated data collection and manual review, so occasional errors or omissions may occur. If you notice a missing project, feel free to mention it in the comments. Only projects meeting the selection criteria outlined below are included.

## Other channels
Other than Reddit, you can also find this list on the following platforms:

- [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1teyu0UXHBgBhnKl2PhpOJGpa7JYn5j3PgFh1-s_gJ-U)
- [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@danielpervan)
- [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/danielpervan.bsky.social)

## Selection Criteria

Projects must meet the following conditions to be included:

1. **Timing:** The project was either launched in the last week or will end in the coming week.
2. **Relevance:** The project is directly related to board games.
    - Excludes: Accessories not strongly related to board games, furniture, RPGs (e.g., D&D, Pathfinder), video games, STLs, painting tools, events, podcasts, and magazines.
    - Exception: Projects offering promos or similar content for board games are eligible.
3. **Backers:** The project is expected to reach at least 100 backers by the end of the campaign.
4. **Funding Status:**
    - The project is expected to reach at least 90% of its funding goal.
    - The project has already achieved at least 20% of its funding goal.

In addition to the main lists, I include a separate section for noteworthy projects that don’t strictly qualify as board games. These projects are included based on a single criterion:

1. **Backers:** The project currently has more than 1,000 backers.

## Crowdfunding is not a store

Crowdfunding is not a guarantee. Projects may face delays, incur additional shipping costs, or fail to deliver entirely. Creators are not obligated to fulfill their promises. While many excellent games are funded this way, the risks are real—only back projects with money you can afford to lose.

Be wary of creators who use [FoMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out) (Fear of Missing Out) tactics to drive pledges. Don’t let the pressure get to you. If you miss a campaign, there will always be others. There's no shortage of excellent board games to enjoy.

## Tags
Each project is tagged with one or more of the following categories:

- 🌱 Creator's First Project
- 🌳 Creator with more than 5 projects
- 🌟 Featured Project (e.g. Kickstarter ""Staff Pick"")
- 💰 Fully funded
- 🔥 More than 200 daily backers
- 🤝 Offers refunds (e.g. [Stable Pledge](https://help.gamefound.com/article/250-what-is-stable-pledge))

1jcnq2l,https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1jcnq2l/hot_take/,Hot take,"I might have a bit of a hot take, but I’m feeling a bit disappointed with the cozy games available right now. I miss the creativity and inspiration. At the moment, we have so many farm simulators or coffee shop games that all start to feel the same, just with a slightly different twist.

Personally, I’d much rather see a fresh, well-developed concept than yet another farming sim. It feels a bit lazy to me. And the thing is, coming up with a new idea isn’t that hard. Just look at the online games that were popular in the 2000s and haven’t been remade. Think about fashion games like Jojo’s Fashion Show or pet care games like Neopets or Nintendogs.

And for once, it would be great if it weren’t just another mobile app, but a fully developed game with real depth. I’m curious—are there more people who feel the same way?",19,1742138282.0,CozyGamers,18,0.81,False
1jcnpvj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jcnpvj,Moonrise Cafe: My Experience,"So I head from my other post about what would be the best coffee in town - or other people's personal favorites - and I had to try this place.

So here we go! First off, this place is cozy, and the people are super great. It is a smaller Cafe, but I feel like that's part of the charm of this place. 

I got a Chipotle Bacon Breakfast Burrito, this thing is one of my new favorite burritos in town! The cheese was creamy, gooey, and was so well distrubuted throughout the entire burrito. You can really taste the chicken, the potatoes, and the spice is perfect even for my wife who doesn't like spicy foods. I did add some of their hot sauce to the burrito because I love spicy foods.
- 5/5 for me, and my new favorite!

My wife got the bacon, egg, and cheddar on a house made roll. The roll was crispy, thick and fluffy, and had great taste. The sauce paired well with the bacon, egg, and the cheddar. This was a great tasting sandwich, but there was only 1 issue - the roll was really thick. This didn't sit well with my wife, and she decided to half.
- 4.5/5, it tasted great, and I personally love a thick roll. Just look at my wife! - lol. 

The coffee was great! I got a Caramel latte with oatmilk, and my wife got a Cherry Vanilla Latte with their house made syrup. My god was this a great tasting coffee, it was smooth, velvety, and the cream kept for the entire time we ate which was awesome because most creamy coffee drinks go flat after a while. 
- 5/5, my wife suggested that they could add more flavor. 

The cake was a Vanilla Raseberry with buttercream frosting, so good, one of the best tasting cakes I had in a long while, it had the perfect amount of raspberry filling that was my favorite part, and the frosting tasted great. I think our only issue with this cake was that there was a quarter of an inch of frosting around the cake, then there was more decorative frosting on top of that. After the center was gone, you're pretty much left with what seemed like a pound of frosting, and it sits heavy in the stomach.
- Flavor is a 5/5, but the frosting being so thick makes the overall experience a 4.5/5 for us.

Both squads come into this encounter on the second night of a back-to-back. But, to be frank, the Thunder are just playing better basketball at the moment. Despite being the visitor in this situation, I say Oklahoma City dominates; they’re the more reliable franchise by a landslide having won 9 of their last 10 games, and every single one of those 9 victories has been by at least 5 points. Take OKC to get the job done tonight, friends.

Thank you!,"Link to copy code, download app, and paste code:\

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I like her as a person, but she *loves* to talk—constantly. I, on the other hand, prefer peace and quiet. I don’t mind some small talk here and there, but I’m not in the mood to chat the entire time I’m at work.

The problem is, as soon as I walk in, she immediately starts talking to me—about *non-work* stuff. I’m *not* a morning person, and I struggle with sleep despite going to bed early. I need my coffee to wake up, so socializing first thing in the morning is the last thing I want to do. I even mentioned my sleeping problems to her, hoping she’d understand, but she brushed it off because she also has insomnia and *still* wants to chat nonstop.

One morning, she was going on and on about something, and I told her that I needed my coffee to kick in before I could chat. She got *really* offended and snapped that ""when you walk into work, you're here to work""—as if that means I have to be *ready* to talk to her. She also said my approach was rude, even though I was trying to be polite.

She once mentioned having a former coworker who told her not to talk to them before 10 AM, and when I asked why that person didn’t offend her, she just said, *""I don’t know. Your approach was offensive. Figure it out.""*

For context, I’m more introverted, and very extroverted people tend to talk *at* me, which gives me anxiety. I *hate* when people dominate conversations without pausing for a response—it happens to me all the time. I have a friend who’s very talkative, and I’ve called her out for interrupting me, which she took well, but I’ve never flat-out told her to *stop talking*.

Quite simply, I don’t want to chat all day at work. I’m fine with occasional conversation, but I prefer long stretches of silence so I can focus.

She found out through Facebook reels made by gurus (she frequents it a lot) that the only way to be rich is to start your own business/be an entrepreneur, problem is she has 0 knowledge of actually running a successful business so she goes to YouTube to search for ""how to make 6 figures by running an online business with 0$ startup costs!"" Or ""how to be rich by doing Amazon affiliate marketing!"" 

And I knew from the getgo that these videos are made by scammers who only care about that YouTube ad revenue or for suckers to buy their courses so they lie out of their behind to convince stupid people that they can be millionaires, but my mom genuinely thinks these people are legit and it's serious advice because narcissists are actually very easy to scam if you tell them exactly what they want to hear. 

 she tries and tries all the advice from these different videos (with help from me because she barely knows how to use a computer) and surprise surprise none of work at all, she hasn't made a single penny after two years of trying these and she's convinced that one day it will work and she's a smart ""businesswoman"".

she told everyone she knew that she works for Amazon and they should support her business but none do, she even turned her Facebook into a business profile where she spams links to her online print on demand clothing shop with overpriced t shirts with lazy canva art or ai art and is surprised that nobody is buying them, thinking that millions would come in and buy. 

But one day she came across a YouTube video saying that you can create a GoFundMe page so that people can give you money to start your own business, and she always wanted to run a coffee shop because she thinks it will be successful like Starbucks and be rich, so she goes ahead and created a GoFundMe me basically saying that she has an idea of running a coffee shop but she's broke to fund it herself so she's asking everyone to just chip in 15000$ so she can be wealthy.

I was honestly so shocked on how delusional she is, she wants to start a business that will most likely fail off of everyone else's dime, and if she somehow  succeeded and she became rich she would give NONE to charity or back to the people who funded for her, GoFundMes are usually reserved for people who are in extreme crisis like hospital bills or their house burned down and they are homeless but she thinks nah, give me money so I can be rich! Im better than everyone else! 

And again after 4 months not a single soul donated to her gofundme and she is SURPRISED like what?? Are you that full of yourself? That's when I realized that narcs are totally far gone mentally and there is 0 possibility of changing them because they spent decades of their life believing that they are the most perfect and important human being the world has ever laid eyes on and everyone should grovel at their feet like peasants.

The damn fridge still stinks of Hoppes. I wouldn't care, but it's going into my food. No liquid was ever spilled. It diffused passively from a grocery bag of Hoppes-soaked paper towels.

Why is it so hard to get insurance to replace it?,"I got a crown put on in 2020 months after breaking a front tooth by falling down a set of stairs while mostly asleep. I did not love the fit of the crown when it was finally ready, but I knew the dentist was going to shut down again because of Covid and I felt like I didn’t have another option. Fast forward to now and my gums around the crown have been irritated ever since. It’s a low level of almost constant pain that I’ve just adjusted to. Is it normal for the gum around the crown to be swollen after over 4 years of getting the crown? Is it normal the have the gap that I have between my gum and the top of the crown? That gap goes far in, to the anchored tooth that is left, and food gets stuck in there easily and causes pain and swelling if I don’t notice and get it out immediately. I’ve had a back and forth with my dentist and insurance trying to get it addressed but I never get an answer. Is it hard to get replaced because I have state health insurance? I feel like this is a long term health concern and I feel so unheard by my dentist and insurance. There aren’t other dentists in my area, I am in a small county and there is one dentist, the one I have, and they are completely overbooked all the time and have traveling dentists in and out so the care feels so disconnected and impersonal. Maybe it’s hard to get the crown because of how my dentist’s office is ran? I do smoke throughout the day and drink coffee in the mornings, and I drink alcohol about every other weekend. Would you agree that this crown seems ill-fitting? Does anyone have experience replacing an ill-fitting crown? I am also worried about how the procedure would go to get it replaced. Is it difficult?

She knows she does it and blames it primarily on her undiagnosed ADHD. 99.9% of the time, I’ve laughed it off and have just accepted it as it being just who she is.

Just this morning, she and I had our usual cup of coffee in bed and just started talking like usual — about life, her work drama, the world around us, etc. She was the first one to acknowledge that she was interrupting me a lot. As we continued talking, the conversation ended up heading into a small debate about addiction and nicotine. Towards the end, I said, “Dang you’re interrupting me a lot today.” That’s when she blamed it on her ADHD. I responded by saying, “I get it. I tend to talk slower than you, and you finish what I’m saying sometimes.” (Which is what she has told me in the past). There was a bit of silence afterwards. I noticed she had a tear coming down her face, and asked if she was crying. I asked her if it was because I was frustrated or if it was because I pointed out her interrupting me. She just turned away and started crying into her pillow. I feel like I ATAH, but I’ve always made sure to never raise my voice at her since we established very early on that it was a trigger for her. Not that it matters, but she even reassured me in the same conversation, that I’ve a fantastic boyfriend and that I’m doing a good job.

Cabin Class: I want a balcony cabin.  I think I am leaning towards Aqua Class right simply because the dining options on Concierge and Veranda are only 830pm.  I might have choose Concierge if I could get a different dining option.  At least Aqua has Blue.  Would the late dining affect seeing a lot of the entertainment?  In some research I see that with Aqua Class you can still end up with a cabin that may have a restricted view.  Is it worth 1000 more to be able to choose your own cabin?

Drink Packages:  The all inclusive package has WIFFI and Classic drinks.  We are in a situation where one of us would use the drink package the other one not as much.  But one of us would probably even use the premium package.  But we both would use the internet.  We both would enjoy speciality coffees, sparkling water, juices, smoothies ect.... Is it worth it to get the packages?  Would it be better to pay the for the cabin on its own and then get a package after or is it better to book the all inclusive and then upgrade after?\\

I ended up going to the hospital on March 14 by ambulance because I thought I was having a heart attack. I bent over to help my 4 year old with something and got a sharp pain in the left side which then led to pain all down my left arm, mostly in the shoulder area but radiating towards my hand. I went to lay down about an hour later and the pain in my arm had not gone away. Within seconds of laying down I started to overheat and my heart started racing with burning in my chest my whole body felt terrible I stood up for a minute and it seemed to settle down but then all the symptoms I had laying down started again and I had to have a bowl movement which I did. After the bowl movent things got better a little bit but was coming in waves with the chest pain and I felt like I couldn't breath my neck started to feel heavy almost. So I called an ambulance and they suggested It could be gallbladder I has a drink with anti acid and lidacine. Which seemed to make the burning almost no existent. They took blood from me and I wait from about 12am to 5:30 am with no answers so I left because my partner had too work and I had a 9 week old and 4 year old to take care of. On the 15th of march,Because they told me it could be a gallbladder issue I did some research to see what it was all about. I was a bit weary of eating food so I only had 3 pieces of bread with butter for the majority of the day. At around 5:30pm I took my daughter out to the park I had been having some mild stomach pain in the right side but nothing substantial I assumed it was from falling asleep sitting up in the chair at the hospital the night before. I had part of a coffee and a burger from McDonald's around 6pm probably a bad decision in hindsight. About 15 minutes later I got a sharp pain in my back and right side of abdomen,all my symptoms started back up again burning of the chest feeling like I need to go to the bathroom but this time things feeling more intense on the right side of the body. I drove the ten minutes home and had two bowel movements one regular one and one that would be considered floating withong minutes of each other. I ended up going back to the hospital and they did blood work again. While waiting for doctor the pain in my stomach and back got worse and I had pain going up to my shoulders. I asked for some Tylenol which made it hurt a little less but not completely gone. Around 10:45 pm I saw the er doctor and they looked at my gallbladder with an ultrasound. He said he couldn't see any gallstones and that he would order me a more in depth ultrasound but could take about a month. He said that maybe I am just getting the flu or something and that he doesn't know what is going on with me. I left still in pain and quite confused on what steps to take until the ultrasound. I still have pain in my stomach as I write this now at 7:37 am on March 16th. So I guess what I am asking is does this sound like gallbladder issues or something else? I do have anxiety and thought after the first time it happend it could have been a panick attack. I have more socially based anxiety and have never had a panic attack in my life. now that the second incident occurred at the park I really believe something else is going on just because of how my body feels, the second one was definately more intense pain while the first was more burning in the chest with a little bit of pain. I do not know what to do from here and I am worried about eating anything cause I don't want to make things worse if it is a gallbladder issue.

Her speed and technique make her one of the best young fencers in Japan.


Weak point or Running gag:

Although she tries to act like an adult, her short stature and expressions give her away, causing Rentarō and the others to see her as adorable instead of elegant.

He always carries his foil with him and uses it to gesture while speaking, which causes chaotic moments.

Every time someone calls her ""pretty"" or ""little"", she gets angry and challenges the person to a duel (although she never actually hurts anyone).

He can't drink coffee without grimacing because ""it's bitter,"" but he insists that adults should drink it.


Iconic phrase:

""I am a refined lady, not a girl! Now face my sword!""



---

Chapter: The lady of the sword and her fight against tenderness

Rentarō witnesses a fencing match in which Erena effortlessly defeats her opponents. Intrigued, he approaches to congratulate her, but accidentally mentions that ""she's impressive for someone so small"", unleashing his fury.


---

Scene 2: The improvised duel

Elena challenges Rentarō to a symbolic duel to demonstrate her maturity. Although Rentarō tries to reject him, Elena chases him with her foil (with no intention of hurting him, but of scaring him a little).


---

Scene 3: The revelation of destiny

In the midst of the confrontation, destiny activates, confirming that Elena is one of Rentarō's soulmates. Upon finding out, Elena blushes, but instead of accepting it immediately, she tries to maintain her dignity by saying:
""If this is destiny... at least treat me like a grown lady!""


---

Scene 4: Presentation to other girlfriends 

Rentarō then introduces Erena, saying:
""And well, that's how it all happened, can I be allowed to have Kenzaki Erena be my girlfriend?""
Chiyo says:
""Hey, I've already seen you somewhere""
Erena answers:
""Now that you mention it...I've seen you too, aren't you Īn Chiyo, the president of my classroom?""
Chiyo answers:
""Yes, I remember where I saw you.""


---

Epilogue:

On a group outing, Rentarō buys ice cream for Erena, who tries to eat it elegantly. However, upon taking a big bite, his face freezes from the cold.

Rentarō smiles: ""Aren't you a little small for big ice creams?""
Erena, furious and with a numb mouth: ""S-shut up and face my sword!""


---

What do you think?

I thought a lot about Kishika when I made it, because I said, Why don't I do it the other way around now? And so Erena was born.



Well, I think it deserves a little Lore:
In an extra chapter, Hahari asks why that is, Erena replies: ""Well, it's a long story...""
And she says that since she was a child she never saw her mother, she had always known her father, until later, her brothers, she has 5, all older than her, told her that her mother abandoned them a few days after she was born, leaving her father to do all the work.
""He broke his back for us, even though everything seemed to collapse like a house of cards, that's why I don't want to be a burden for him""",1,1742135950.0,100Fanojo,0,1.0,False

Most likely just worried starting a new medication, but I don't know anyone dealing with similar so thought it would be benefital to ask here.

  
I've started my loading dose of a humeria bio-similar for severe prositor uveituis, pretty optamisitic seeing the remission rates and less immunosuppression than steroids. Also looking forward to tapering off prednisolone.

  
However I've been feeling very off and I'm wondering whether it's just the initial humeria hangover, maybe other people can compare their experiences with my own?

  
The first 3 days or so I had super fatgiue which was quite convenient as I could fall asleep better and just power through the day with coffee. I think this is improving though. 

However, more recently (day 4 & 5) I've had a fat headache, still fatigued, and feeling generally unwell. Is this something to except with humeria or should I be more concerned? I've been pretty much self isolating and only going out for exercise or shopping, I'm still on 15mg prednisolone with the humeria bio-similar and at university so I'm being very careful lol

  
Any advice would be great and apologies for the lack of knowledge

I had kind of a ""glow up"" 3 years ago, I'm now considered attractive (wtf) and get a lot of attention from men AND women. The problem is that these people are the same types of people who bullied me relentlessly as a child. It's the good looking queen b type of women that are instantly drawn to me. Its the frat boys and ""popular"" guys that now smile toward me and treat me like a human being. 

I've had women from high school who were mean bullies to me reach out on social media and treat me better, ask to go out for coffee or what ever. I've been extremely depressed since coming to this realization. I haven't changed my personality. I'm still the same person as I was then, but just a bit more attractive.

Balcony furniture sets for apartments are essential for transforming small outdoor spaces into cozy retreats. With urban living often limited to compact areas, selecting the right furniture can significantly enhance your balcony's functionality and aesthetic appeal. When considering balcony furniture sets, prioritize compact designs that maximize the available space while providing comfort.

One popular option is bistro sets, known for their compact size and charming design. These sets typically include a small table and two chairs, perfect for enjoying a morning coffee or evening wine. Many bistro sets are crafted from weather-resistant materials, ensuring durability against the elements and easy maintenance.

Another attractive choice is modular seating arrangements, which offer flexibility in layout. These sets can be rearranged to suit your needs, making them ideal for hosting friends or relaxing solo. Opting for sets that include cushions adds an inviting touch, enhancing comfort throughout the day.

When selecting balcony furniture, consider sets that incorporate storage solutions. Furniture with built-in storage can help you keep your space tidy and organized while maximizing usability. Many modern designs feature hidden compartments or shelving, which is perfect for stashing away gardening supplies or outdoor games.

Material choice is also crucial. Lightweight aluminum, sturdy teak, or weatherproof resin wicker offer different aesthetics and levels of durability, making them suitable for various climates. Additionally, choosing furniture with UV-resistant fabrics can help maintain vibrant colors and prevent fading.

In summary, choosing balcony furniture sets for apartments should prioritize space efficiency, comfort, and style. By selecting the right materials and designs, you can create an inviting outdoor oasis that complements your living space. Whether you prefer a classic bistro set or a contemporary modular arrangement, the right balcony furniture can make all the difference.

The magnifica evo has tested my patience to say the least, but with all the great reviews online it has to be something I’m doing. 

When I’m trying to pull an espresso shot, I will randomly get an error light - exclamation mark inside a triangle. In the beginning I was able to figure out that I had my grind settings too fine, now I’ve had it at 4. 

My partner likes brewed coffee, and for him I have pre ground coffee that I put in the appropriate area. Right after I then try to pull an espresso shot for me using the beans in the hopper, I get that same error. I’ve wasted so many beans trying to get it to pull a shot over and over. 

I’m starting to regret this machine. It just seems so temperamental. But I’m also convinced I might be doing something wrong ?

No warning, no heads up, just got woken up by them drilling, hammering, making a ton of noise first thing in the morning. Then of course, my dog (puppy) started barking because of all the chaos, and guess who had to deal with it? Me.

I had to go immediately to calm her down, and that was it lol I was stuck there for the entire morning. They decided to do their tasks up there, so I had no choice but to stay too, making sure she didn’t bark, didn’t get in their way, didn’t “annoy” them.

Around 9:30am, I finally went downstairs to get breakfast, but I heard them handling her roughly. So I had to go back up again to make sure she was ok and protect her.

Then my father had the audacity to blame me for everything taking longer. Said that if I had taken her for a walk earlier, they would’ve finished faster, except it was way too hot in the morning (summer here), and he expected me to walk with her for an hour just so he could do his stuff in peace. Later, he even came to ask, “If I do things up there, will she start barking?” Just another way to guilt trip me, like I’m responsible for all of it.

And to top it all off, when I finally went downstairs to eat, they had drunk all the coffee. Almost 11am, and I still hadn’t eaten anything, I was there the whole time standing in the heat.

I ended up getting it for about 3600 after tax.  However, I'm still considering returning it.  Admittedly, I'm a console gamer at best and for an everyday computer I use a Macbook Max which is very quiet.

I've tested the ASUS Zephyrus 4070 and it was a beautiful laptop.  I was fine with the performance, but it got hot as all hell and the fan noise was loud.   I feel that Legion 9i is an even better  looking laptop, but the fan noise is driving me nuts with these laptops.  God forbid you are playing a game that's quiet and suspenseful.

My questions to gamers are...do you generally game with headphones?   Will a 4090 laptop out perform a desktop 4070 Super?  I get the portability factor of owning a laptop, but to some degree I feel it's a pointless argument for gaming laptops.  I wouldn't feel comfortable bringing any of these laptops in a library, coffee shop, etc.  Even when I'm at home, it seem like it would be a big inconvenience for anyone else sitting in the room because of the noise, so it kinda defeats the purpose of being portable.

 I'm  literally leaning towards buying a desktop 4070 Super for half the price of the Legion.   The desktop are extremely quiet compared to the laptops and I could buy 32in external  OLED screen and still be under the price point of the Legion 9i and other high performance gaming laptops. Or I could go the route of buying a desktop and just waiting on the Legion 2 Handheld if I really needed to game away from home and probably still would be under the cost of these gaming laptops.

But, when my wife asks me to do these things and I seem resistant it’s always. I’ll give you head, or I’ll have sex with you *toned done for less graphicness*. Which is fine, and sometimes can work with me. The thing that seems to upset me is when these things are offered they’re either forgotten about as soon as I arrive back, or i will kind of remind her a little later.

Basically, I treat it like a video game: getting to know my surroundings, what each ""NPC"" does, how to level up, and what starting tools or items I have.

1. Get coffee with everyone you can. Absorb information. Don't be all business—socialize, especially in a small team. Have 1:1 meetings with as many people as possible. Find a work buddy who can vouch for you and possibly refer you later (potentially a tech buddy). Build relationships with co-workers who are happy to help.
2. Don't lie. Don't get drunk. Don't gossip.
3. Show effort: In tech, effort matters as much as results. Show willingness by occasionally staying an extra 30 minutes when needed and volunteering for tasks. Stay motivated and take initiative.
4. **Secure Early Wins, Show Results:** Get an early victory by completing a visible task exceptionally well. Prove yourself through your first few assignments. Be thorough and put in extra hours during your first month. Make your first contribution in week one—find something small and manageable, then excel at it. Remember: ""If you have a reputation for coming in early, you can be late every day."" Put in extra effort at the beginning to establish yourself as reliable. In a good workplace, this builds trust and flexibility. When tackling your first deliverable, go above and beyond—people will respect you and invest in your success.
5. **Effective Communication with Boss, 90 day plan**: Have five key conversations with your boss about situational diagnosis, expectations, communication styles, resource needs, and personal development. Use these to create your 90-day plan. Understand your manager's expectations for your first 30 to 90 days. Stay proactive, track your contributions, and maintain regular progress updates.
6. Keep weekly reports in Apple Notes. Take thorough notes about possibly everything.
7. Don't wait 5-7 months to show your potential, as commonly advised. Be brave, bold, and confident to get ahead. Don't fear being inventive, but avoid showing off or making immediate changes. Be polite to everyone. Combine the confidence of a mid-level employee with a junior's eagerness to learn.
8. Get up, dress up, and show up.

My Gf and I are living together for almost a year now and we have that routine on sunday to clean our apparment together, she does kitchen, I do bathroom. Additionally Im having my shaving routine and doing mealprep for the next week. I also take my time, enjoying my coffee and breakfast.(I had this routine even before the relationship and my GF knew of it from the start). Since we moved in together there have regularely been disputes about my behavior on sunday. (I would be too slow with my stuff, leaving her with additionnal work and basicly delay her cleaning.) 
Today this whole conflict escalated in her accusing me that all I do on Sunday is making her cleaning more time consuming, my routine is fking up her schedule, I leave the kitchen in a mess and basicly the whole shedule I have is highly egocentric and leaves no room for her doing her chores more quickly. (Her main problem is that my meal prepping is taking to long that she ""would have to work until 3/4 PM to get her stuff done"". So I told her: ""Fine, I ll do the meal prepping on saturday so there wont be any hold ups for you on sunday, ill just finish my breakfast and ure g2g."" (I admit, I was pretty annoyed by that argument at that time). Then she was mad because I made this decision without trying to find a compromise first, which turned into her crying, saying I would never be able to compromise and always put myself in the first place before the relationship.

My question now: AITAH for defending my sunday morning routine and being to stubborn in this situation? Thanks",1,1742134520.0,AITAH,22,1.0,False

A few years ago my grandma was killed. For the longest time we have been trying to find her coffee cup. It was an antique from the 30s, 40s, or 50s. We have a photo of the cup, and a couple photos of some of her china that we feel like the cup shared designs with. 

Her cup that she originally had was broken, so we are all wanting to try to find more of them to buy for us grandkids to remember her by. She would always drink her coffee and talk with us, it was just kind of a part of her. 

The final photo is the actual cup we took from the background of a picture. The second photo is a picture from online that I think has the same pattern as the cup had. The cup had gold in the handle. The first photo are some of her plates. 

Any help identifying it would be helpful! ",1,1742134317.0,HelpMeFind,2,1.0,False
