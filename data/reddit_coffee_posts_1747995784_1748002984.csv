I took Pylera, finished the treatment, and did a follow-up endoscopy and biopsy in 2019. The result said the h. pylori was gone, no ulcers or anything, just mild inflammation. The doctor said it was nothing to worry about. Since then, I never had another positive test. I‚Äôve also never vomited ‚Äî not even during the worst of it.

But here‚Äôs the thing. It‚Äôs now 2025. That‚Äôs six full years. And I still don‚Äôt feel right. Not sick exactly, but not normal either.

I still burp way more than a normal person, every day, especially if I bike or do anything physical. every night a wake up with what feels like a sore stomach, not painful, just like pressure or discomfort that only goes away when I sip water. I get nausea when I nap after lunch, especially if I lie on my back. It wakes me up and feels awful, but I never actually throw up. Sometimes I get a tight chest or a weird ‚Äúair bubble‚Äù feeling in my throat that makes me want to clear it constantly ‚Äî that can last for weeks.

I eat normally. I digest heavy meals. I‚Äôve gained weight. I drink coffee in the morning and eat bread, dairy, meat ‚Äî all fine. Garlic and spicy stuff makes me worse, but not right away ‚Äî it usually hits me¬†*at night*¬†when I‚Äôm trying to sleep.

No acid in the throat. No regurgitation. No vomit. Just this ongoing, annoying fake sickness (burps , constent air bubble in throat , waking up at night with sore stomach sometime nausea that goes with either burping or water ,if sever ice in neck) that never escalates but never fully leaves.

I‚Äôve read about functional dyspepsia and vagus nerve stuff, and honestly, it fits. I even ran it all by ChatGPT and it made more sense than anything I‚Äôve heard from doctors. But I still have that doubt in the back of my head ‚Äî what if something‚Äôs lingering?

Like for example I have this group of basketball friends, and I‚Äôm not the best 3 point shooter, but am the fastest/most athletic and can drive in most of the time and score.

I know basketball shit-talking is a thing, but it is crazy excessive. Every time I touch the ball - ‚Äúhe ass‚Äù, ‚Äúlet him shoot‚Äù, ‚Äútrash-ass n****‚Äù

I‚Äôm no professional - so it‚Äôs hard to block it out all the time and when I say all the time it is CONSTANT, it‚Äôs every single time I touch the ball - even tho I‚Äôm locking up the best player and scoring almost half the points consistently on the other end from 2‚Äôs. Then after the game I get hella blamed for every loss despite so many other people on the team literally missing every shot and not playing any defense. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs jealously bc my 3 point shot is really bad there is nothing to be jealous of

In the group chat they‚Äôll talk for a week. It‚Äôs not a big deal, but this is a subreddit for help on why it might be happening and what I can do to maybe help it a bit. Most of the time I can take it, but like once a month it gets too far. 

This is all usually fine, but yesterday I was talking back and one dude got so mad he actually left. He talked a lot of shit in the groupchat (which he started - making fun of my herniated disc of all things and not being able to sit?) so I kept calling him a little ‚Äúbitch‚Äù for talking online then being quiet irl.

Then everybody got the nerve to say (in a serious non joking way ‚Äúdude stop arguing you taking the fun out‚Äù when I was going in on this guy. This part pissed me off too. Yeah I was talking a lot of shit but I felt I was justified in all of it. Like how can you talk so much in the groupchat (with everyone going in on my disc injury at the same time of course - half the time I‚Äôm just defending myself the other half I just don‚Äôt say anything)

Also, at work, in my group of work friends, I like drinking the free coffee and not going to buy the coffee shop coffee every day. That‚Äôs something I get made fun of for. It doesn‚Äôt bother me, I just don‚Äôt see nobody else who gets that coffee get made fun of. Granted it‚Äôs light banter and not anything compared to the other group, but still I just started a job here. There‚Äôs also a lot of shit talk from my mentor - all in a light way but I just don‚Äôt see anybody else be treated like this. It‚Äôs really not bad at all but just constant and curious why it‚Äôs me

This made me think, why do I always seem to be the target in every friend group? Is it lack of respect? Is it because I try to argue back and it makes it seem like these jabs get to me so they do it more?

Ever hit that mid-afternoon slump where your brain feels like it‚Äôs melting? üß†üíß Yeah, me too. Every. Single. Day. It‚Äôs like 3 PM rolls around, and suddenly the world feels like it's moving through molasses. But *guess what*? I think I might‚Äôve found a little magic ‚Äî **Box Breathing** ‚Äî and it‚Äôs simple, scientific, and might just be the reboot button we‚Äôve all been craving. üöÄ

So, what‚Äôs box breathing? Besides sounding a bit fancy, it‚Äôs actually quite straightforward. It‚Äôs a breathing technique that helps you hit pause on stress and normalize cortisol levels (thank you, science!). And I experimented with it for a full week ‚Äî spoiler alert: it‚Äôs a game-changer. üòé

Here‚Äôs what the routine looked like:

1. **Inhale**: Breathe in through your nose for 4 seconds.
2. **Hold**: Hold your breath for 4 seconds. Cue the Jeopardy theme...
3. **Exhale**: Breathe out slowly through your mouth for 4 seconds.
4. **Hold again**: Yep, hold that emptiness for another 4 seconds.

Rinse and repeat this little square of breath-tranquility for about 5 minutes. Sounds easy, right? But man, did it make a difference. ‚ú®

### Here‚Äôs how it worked for me:

- **Day 1-2**: Initially, I felt a bit silly (Am I breathing right? üòÇ), but quickly realized how obvious my stress levels were.
- **Day 3-5**: I started looking forward to my mid-afternoon brain spa. My concentration felt sharper, and I wasn't reaching for coffee like a lifeline. üôå
- **Day 6-7**: Officially converted! Cooler, calmer, and suddenly more capable of taking on those tasks that made me want to nap under my desk before.

Why does it work? It's all about that cortisol ‚Äî you know, the pesky ""stress hormone."" Box breathing helps keep it balanced, which means less stress and a happier, clearer mind. üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

But hey, don‚Äôt take my word for it. Have you tried box breathing, or any other sneaky tricks to combat the afternoon slump? Maybe you've got a totally wacky tip that keeps you energized ‚Äî I‚Äôm all ears! üòâ

1kti0nq,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1kti0nq/mediumdark_roast_is_too_bitter_bambinojultra/,Medium/dark roast is too bitter [Bambino/J-Ultra],"Hey all, I got some coffee from Atlas and it‚Äôs on the darker side. Nothing like the Starbucks ‚Äúmedium roast‚Äù I‚Äôve seen on here, but definitely dark. So far, I‚Äôve learned that I prefer a little bit darker flavor with slightly less acidity in my cup, but these beans are only giving me a very smokey espresso with a sticky/bitter finish that lingers. Pretty unpleasant and I‚Äôd prefer a little bit more acidity and just overall balance.

Notes:
-19.0 g in, 38-40 g out
-J-Ultra is set to 1.1.5 (I think that‚Äôs how you notate it, right? Either way, this is more fine than I‚Äôm used to using. I usually go for 1.2.5)
-Shot time is 25-30 seconds typically 

My first thought was over extraction, but the shot seems to pull perfectly. If I grind any courser or use a smaller dose, it pulls way too quickly and tastes kind of thin while still being bitter.

1kti0fi,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1kti0fi/she_was_never_mine_but_losing_her_still_broke_me/,"She was never mine, but losing her still broke me","I‚Äôm 25, male, from Austin, Texas.

It started back in college. I met this girl through a class project. She was funny, kind, one of those people who actually looked at you when you talked. I got attached‚Äîway too fast, probably. But it wasn‚Äôt just a crush. It felt deeper.

She used to text me late at night, share memes, vent about her day. We went for coffee, walked back from class together, had those conversations that stretch past midnight and make you feel seen. I kept telling myself, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs just being nice, don‚Äôt get your hopes up,‚Äù but part of me really thought maybe she felt something too.

Then one day... she just stopped.

No warning. No fight. No slow fade. Just silence.

No replies. No eye contact at class. No explanation.

I spiraled. It felt like a breakup, but worse, because there was nothing I could point to‚Äîno closure, no reason. Just this huge hole where she used to be.

What really messed with me was how familiar that feeling was. That sudden detachment, the emotional whiplash, the way I blamed myself for everything‚Ä¶ it all dragged up stuff I hadn‚Äôt thought about in years. Stuff from when I was a kid. Being ignored. Abandoned. Left hanging by people I trusted.

I didn‚Äôt realize at the time, but it triggered something deep. I started getting panic attacks again. Couldn‚Äôt sleep. Every unread message made my chest tighten. I even found myself checking her socials obsessively, hoping for some kind of clue.

It‚Äôs wild how one-sided love can feel like real loss. And how something so simple‚Äîa silence‚Äîcan reopen wounds you thought were long buried.

I don‚Äôt hate her. I don‚Äôt even blame her. But I wish I could explain how hard it hit me. How hard it still hits me sometimes.

If anyone‚Äôs ever had someone vanish from your life and it left you shattered, just know you‚Äôre not weak. It‚Äôs not just you. That pain is real.

And it doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre unlovable. It just means you cared.

So, how do we hit ""pause"" on that endless stream of thoughts? Here‚Äôs my **go-to technique** that truly helps me wrangle my racing mind:

**The 5-4-3-2-1 Grounding Technique** 

This isn‚Äôt just a trendy mindfulness buzzword; it‚Äôs practical, it‚Äôs easy, and honestly, it works like magic. Here‚Äôs how it goes:

1. **Look around you and find 5 things you can see.**  
   - That mug? Yep. The cute cat poster? Definitely. The stack of laundry? Ugh, yes. But focus on the things that make you smile, too! üåº

2. **Then, touch 4 things.**  
   - Maybe it‚Äôs your cozy sweater, the smooth desk, or even your own hair (we‚Äôve all done it). Get tactile!

3. **Listen for 3 sounds.**  
   - Is there a clock ticking? Birds chirping outside? Maybe your neighbor‚Äôs lawn mower providing an unwelcome concert? üê¶

4. **Next, identify 2 scents.**  
   - How about that freshly brewed coffee or the lingering scent of last night‚Äôs dinner? Sometimes it‚Äôs just the smell of your favorite candle that brings comfort.

5. **Finally, taste 1 thing.**  
   - Pop a piece of gum in your mouth, sip your drink, or just savor that last crumb of chocolate. üç´

Doing this simple exercise really pulls you back into the moment and just *hits the reset button* on that overactive brain. I‚Äôve done this during stressful work moments or even before bed when my mind refuses to settle down.

But here‚Äôs the kicker: It‚Äôs not just about the exercise; it‚Äôs about tuning into your senses and literally reminding yourself that you‚Äôre right here, right now. It‚Äôs like giving your brain a little vacation!

2. Identify 3‚Äì5 core psychological elements or traits (e.g., resilience, curiosity, inner conflict).
3. Translate each trait into a symbolic representation (e.g., a phoenix for resilience, a labyrinth for introspection).
4. Combine these symbols into a cohesive artistic theme for a tattoo design.
5. Output a final ImageGen tattoo prompt that includes artistic style (e.g., fine line, geometric, watercolor), the symbolic elements, and the emotional tone of the image.
6. Generate the final image using the ImageGen tool based on the prompt on step 5.

The hardest part of my grandma‚Äôs dementia, for the last few years has been that she can no longer do anything or enjoy anything that stimulates her mind. She gets up everyday and just sits on the sofa just staring into space all day, with occasional trips to stare out of the window, go to the toilet or make a cup of tea.

We tried for a long time to stimulate her mind, whether it be putting the TV on for her, or trying to do colouring/arts and crafts with her. I thought we‚Äôd hit the jackpot with some magazines a couple of years ago but she soon put them down and threw them out without even looking through half of them. And admittedly we gave up.

Early last year we started getting our local adult social care team involved for help with her in general, and they told us that there‚Äôs a daycare centre local to us that operates all week, a bus will pick her up and drop her back off at home, sometimes have trips out for the day, and we managed to convince my grandma to go where she absolutely loves it.

The days have worked out perfectly. She has a neighbour who comes and visits her for a coffee every Monday, Wednesday and Friday morning for a couple of hours which helps stimulate her, and every fortnightly Wednesday she has a friend who she used to work with come and visit her. She then goes to her daycare every Tuesday and Saturday, and so her only days with no stimulation now are Thursdays and Sundays.

But our local council have been making cutbacks over the last few months and have decided to close the daycare centre on Tuesdays and Thursdays. They‚Äôve been trying to make the days work in a local community centre but they phoned me last week to say it‚Äôs not been working out and my grandma will have to go on a Monday, Wednesday or Friday as of early June.

I‚Äôve been trying to gently discuss it with her but she‚Äôs not understanding me. But all I keep thinking about is how miserable she is on Thursdays and Sundays when her friends don‚Äôt visit and she‚Äôs got nothing to do. With her daycare changing, we‚Äôre now going to have Tuesdays in the mix.

And on these days she‚Äôs at home, she‚Äôs miserable. She sulks all day, and she‚Äôs starting to get aggressive towards us now, more so on these days and we‚Äôre at our wits end. I‚Äôm not prepared at all for a third day of her in a mood.

Her friend who visits fortnightly used to visit on a Tuesday before daycare started, so I‚Äôm going to ask if she‚Äôs available to move back to Tuesdays. But that‚Äôs only going to be fortnightly and I‚Äôve noticed over the last few weeks she‚Äôs really struggling with my grandma in terms of communication and in general like we all are so I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if she wants to stop coming altogether. But then my grandma‚Äôs recently become extremely clingy towards her too and there‚Äôs no way we can help or calm her down.

Out of the blue, he sent me a voice note... a collection of little sound bites he'd recorded over the past week. Every clip was just random moments of his day where he thought of me, from 'I just ordered your fave coffee,' to 'Had a great meeting today, wish you were here to celebrate.' It seemed so simple, but hearing his voice, all the little affirmations, and knowing I was on his mind that often... it was everything.

The doctor said it was nothing to worry about. Since then, I never had another positive test. I‚Äôve also never vomited ‚Äî not even during the worst of it.

But here‚Äôs the thing. It‚Äôs now 2025. That‚Äôs six full years. And I still don‚Äôt feel right. Not sick exactly, but not normal either.

I still burp way more than a normal person, every day, especially if I bike or do anything physical.  every night a wake up with what feels like a sore stomach, not painful, just like pressure or discomfort that only goes away when I sip water. I get  nausea when I nap after lunch, especially if I lie on my back. It wakes me up and feels awful, but I never actually throw up. Sometimes I get a tight chest or a weird ‚Äúair bubble‚Äù feeling in my throat that makes me want to clear it constantly ‚Äî that can last for weeks.

No inventory, no ads, no website needed. Just pure middleman hustle.  

Here‚Äôs the dumb simple way it works:  

### **Step 1: Find Struggling Creators**  
I hunt down people selling eBooks, Canva templates, or PDF guides on Gumroad/Payhip. Most have like 2 sales total. I DM them: *""Hey can I resell your product? You keep 100% of what I pay you""*  

Shockingly, about 70% say yes because they‚Äôre desperate for any sales.  

### **Step 2: List Everywhere (Except Where They Already Are)**  
I throw their stuff on:  
- eBay (weirdly works for printables)  
- Etsy (under ""digital download"" categories nobody checks)  
- Random niche marketplaces like Creative Market or even Fiverr  

### **Step 3: Profit (Like $8 at a Time)**  
When someone buys from me:  
1. I buy the product from original creator at their price  
2. Download the file  
3. Email it to my buyer with some bs ""thank you for your purchase!"" note  

Margins are tiny ($5-$15 per sale) but it ADDS UP. Last month cleared $387 doing maybe 2 hours/week.  

### **Why This Works**  
- Creators don‚Äôt care because they get paid either way  
- Buyers don‚Äôt know/care they‚Äôre buying from a reseller  
- Platforms don‚Äôt police this unless you‚Äôre dumb about it  

**Pro Tip:** Focus on ultra-specific niches (think ""Bridal Hair Styling Guides"" not generic ""Instagram Templates""). Less competition, weirder buyers who don‚Äôt price compare.  

Not gonna lie‚Äîit‚Äôs not life-changing money. But for zero risk and almost no time? I‚Äôll take free coffee money.

Many many years I have been drinking my coffee from a Philips Senso pad machine. These machines are very easy to use. They require almost no maintenance. The coffee pads are relatively cheap (especially compared to cups).

Since my current machine started leaking a bit, I would like to replace it. Though the taste of the coffee is okay, I am quite sure that using coffee beans will result in a better taste and coffee experience.

So, here comes the problem. I have been looking for a superautomic bean to cup machine. These machines are quite nice, but the extra cleaning that is involved does not appeal tom me at all. You have to clean the brew group every week. There is descaling. The drip tray has to be emptied and cleaned every day. Pucks have to be thrown away, if it produces milk drinks the milk system has to be rinsed and so on ... It seems like quite some extra work.

So I am wondering, are there other type of coffee machines that are easy to use and require less cleaning? Especially no cleaning of a brew group and no daily emptying and cleaning of (drip) trays.

I like my coffee, but I don't want all the extra hussle and cleaning involved. Are there perhaps easier systems to consider. I heard about piston machines, but I do not know how they work and if they are easier to maintain. I am open to all suggestions. Budget to spend, let's say somehwere between $300 - $800.",1,1748001328.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

I‚Äôm 27M and my girlfriend is 29F.
We‚Äôve been together for 1 year and 4 months and have lived together for almost a year now. This morning I woke up early and offered to make her a coffee. She agreed, so I brewed a pot and asked how she would like it prepared. She said never mind and that she‚Äôll finish preparing it herself, so I let her take over.

Later, I asked her why she changed the plan and told me to stop. She snapped back that I was making an elephant out of a mosquito, and we both ended up feeling hurt (me confused that my help was rejected, her annoyed that her need for autonomy was questioned).

I can see both sides here:
- My side: I wanted to do something nice and felt a bit put out when my offer was declined after I‚Äôd already started.
- Her side: She wanted to do it her own way this morning and felt criticised when I revisited her request.

I‚Äôm curious how others would handle this. Am I overthinking a simple change of plan? How can we communicate better so ‚Äúhelp‚Äù doesn‚Äôt turn into a point of contention?

Thanks in advance for any insights!

Let‚Äôs address the obvious:¬†**this article is long**.

You‚Äôre used to skimming. This isn‚Äôt made for that.

I could‚Äôve chopped it into chunks. Thrown in cute little headings. Made it easier to scroll past, but that‚Äôs not what this is.

This is from the heart.

But this isn‚Äôt a report. This is from the heart.  
And some things ‚Äî especially truth ‚Äî should never be made too convenient.

If you stick with me, I promise: it‚Äôll be worth your time.  
**Do you trust me?**  
\_\_\_

**Right now**, you‚Äôre reading this sentence. And while it may feel simple ‚Äî just letters on a screen ‚Äî your computer doesn‚Äôt see it that way.

Your computer doesn‚Äôt understand letters. Or words. Or language. It understands¬†**machine language**¬†‚Äî a code made entirely of¬†**1s and 0s**. Just two symbols. That‚Äôs it.

*ON*¬†or¬†*OFF*.¬†*YES*¬†or¬†*NO*.

This is called¬†**binary notation**, or the¬†**base-2 number system**.

Most ‚Äî if not all ‚Äî of us are used to¬†**base-10**,¬†**what we learned in school**. We count from 0 to 9, and when we hit 10, we carry over to the next column. Simple, right?

**Binary**¬†works the same way ‚Äî but with only¬†**0 and 1**.

Let me show you how it works ‚Äî don‚Äôt worry if you‚Äôve never seen this before. It‚Äôs simpler than you think!

Each digit in binary represents a power of 2:

* The first column =¬†**1**
* The second =¬†**2**
* Then¬†**4**,¬†**8**,¬†**16**,¬†**32**, and so on.

So:  
**0001**¬†= 1  
**0010**¬†= 2  
**0011**¬†= 3 (2 + 1)  
**0100**¬†= 4  
**0101**¬†= 5 (4 + 1)  
**1000**¬†= 8  
‚Ä¶  
**100001**¬†= 33  
‚Ä¶ and on and on and on.

Each digit is like a¬†**light switch**: OFF = 0, ON = 1.

So when you see¬†**1000**, that‚Äôs not one-thousand ‚Äî it‚Äôs just the 8‚Äôs switch turned ON.

This is how you express numbers as we know them as binary: by turning switches ON and OFF to represent them in a 2-base number system.

Now, some tech people might point out that modern computers use all kinds of clever voltage tricks, encoding schemes, and error correction. That‚Äôs true.

But at the end of the day, all those fancy layers still reduce to one simple idea:¬†**two reliable electrical states ‚Äî ON and OFF**. That‚Äôs why we treat it as 1s and 0s.

This is how your computer¬†*‚Äúthinks.‚Äù*¬†Not in nuance, not in feelings ‚Äî just:

* YES or NO
* ON or OFF
* TRUE or FALSE

Sound familiar?

**Male or Female. Penis or Vagina. 1 fucks 0 and out of 0 comes 1! And on, and on, and on‚Ä¶**  
*Let there be life, Let there be light!*‚ö°Ô∏è

(Sorry, sorry ‚Äî getting carried away. Let‚Äôs continue, shall we?)

Unfortunately, this is how a lot of people still see the world. Some don‚Äôt think beyond binary. They can‚Äôt ‚Äî¬†**or they choose not to**. More on that later.

But that‚Äôs not how¬†**you**¬†work. That‚Äôs not how¬†**any**¬†of us work ‚Äî not even the people who hate us so.

Let me show you what comes next.

\_\_\_

Have you heard of¬†**quantum computers**?

Unlike traditional computers that use¬†**bits**¬†(which are either 1 or 0), quantum computers use¬†**qubits**. A qubit can be:

* 0
* 1
* Or any mix of¬†**both at the same time**¬†‚Äî until you look at it.

It‚Äôs called¬†*superposition*, and it means the qubit doesn‚Äôt pick a side until it‚Äôs observed. Kind of like existing in a space between certainty and potential.

1 is finite.  
But 0? It is both nothing¬†*and*¬†infinite.  
That‚Äôs what we call potential!  
Isn‚Äôt that wonderful?

So no ‚Äî quantum computers don‚Äôt literally ‚Äúhave three states‚Äù ‚Äî but they¬†***act***¬†like they do. And that unlocks behaviors and possibilities that go far beyond the old binary switchboard.

**Way**¬†beyond anything traditional computers can do ‚Äî will ever do.  
It can go where older machines cannot. Like Doc Brown once said:

***‚ÄúWhere we‚Äôre going, we don‚Äôt need roads.‚Äù***

You see where I‚Äôm going with this?

Even computers are evolving beyond the limits of binary thinking.

**We are not binary.**  
Definitionally, there is nothing binary about us.  
We are¬†**thinking**,¬†**feeling**,¬†**choosing**¬†beings.  
  
We don‚Äôt live in just 1s and 0s ‚Äî we live in¬†**spectrums**: of identity, of experience, of love.

Two people can observe the same event and see something completely different.

Even¬†**identical twins**, treated equally by loving parents, will never be identical.

Now yes ‚Äî computers¬†*can*¬†model spectrums. They do it all the time.  
24-bit color isn‚Äôt binary red or blue ‚Äî it‚Äôs¬†*millions*¬†of colors, built from combinations of 1s and 0s.

But that‚Äôs the point:  
*Even machines*¬†need¬†**layers and nuance**¬†to simulate a world as complex as ours.

**Humans don‚Äôt need to simulate it.**  
We¬†**are**¬†it.

Even the way we make decisions proves this,¬†**unequivocally**.

In programming, there‚Äôs something called a¬†**conditional statement**. Let me show you. This might sound familiar:

‚ÄúIf I get off work early, I‚Äôll grab coffee with a friend. Else, I‚Äôll go to bed.‚Äù

That‚Äôs a decision tree. A system of possibilities.  
The way we live and love and express ourselves?  
It‚Äôs built on this kind of logic ‚Äî but with emotion. With context.¬†**With soul**.

Isn‚Äôt that interesting?

Despite being an extension of cold logic, when we introduce¬†**conditions**, we¬†**extend ‚Äî**¬†we unlock infinite possibilities ‚Äî beyond¬†**true or false**, beyond¬†**1s and 0s**.

So when someone says:

‚ÄúThere are only two genders,‚Äù

What they‚Äôre really doing is clinging to the¬†**simplest**¬†kind of logic humans ever invented.

The kind that powers¬†*microwaves*.

Not¬†*minds*, and never the heart.

**True or False. Yes or No.**¬†*Getting it yet?*

The truth is ‚Äî people who fear identity, who fear queerness, who fear¬†*transness*¬†‚Äî they‚Äôre not really scared of¬†**you**.

They‚Äôre scared of what you represent.

They‚Äôre scared of¬†**freedom**.

They were raised on conditions:

* ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt you act more like your brother?‚Äù
* ‚ÄúWhy do you dress like that?‚Äù
* ‚ÄúYou want people to think you‚Äôre weird?‚Äù
* ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to embarrass the family!‚Äù

No ads. No cold emails. No Upwork.

Just‚Ä¶ good old digital sleuthing.

Here‚Äôs exactly what I did:

üîç **Step 1: I Picked a Niche & a City**  
I started with local businesses I *actually care about* ‚Äî in my case, coffee shops and fitness studios .

Why? Because:

* They often rely on foot traffic + local SEO
* Many still have awful websites üò¨

üó∫Ô∏è **Step 2: I Searched on Google Maps (Not Google Search)**  
This is the secret sauce.

I typed ‚Äúcoffee shop near Colombo‚Äù and opened their **Google Business Profiles** one by one.  
Then I clicked their **website links**.

Here‚Äôs what I looked for:

* Sites that were outdated, broken, or non-mobile-friendly
* Sites that took forever to load
* No clear call-to-action or online booking

If I saw that, I added them to a spreadsheet.

üìû **Step 3: I Reached Out ‚Äî But Not Like a Salesperson**  
This is where most freelancers blow it.

Instead of sending a pitch like ‚ÄúHey, I can build you a website,‚Äù I sent this:

* 11 emails sent
* 4 replies
* 3 turned into paying clients
* 1 is now on a monthly retainer

üí° **Bonus Tips:**

* Use Loom to record a 2-min video audit of their website
* Mention ONE specific thing you can improve
* Keep your tone chill, not corporate

This complex feeling, commonly referred to as relief, can be deconstructed into a sequence of interconnected cognitive and physiological events, masquerading as a simple emotional response.

The primary catalyst in this intricate biochemical symphony was the realization of task completion, effectuating an immediate decline in cortisol levels‚Äîa key suspect in my stress portfolio. This physiological shift was accompanied by a predictable uptick in dopamine, ostensibly liberating the 'feel-good' responses throughout my neural circuitry. Consequently, the sensation of tension, previously localized in the trapezius region, dissolved with measurable rapidity, akin to the dissipating swirls of cream in coffee.

Concurrently, a cognitive recognition of triumph surfaced, transmuting former anticipatory anxiety into post-achievement serenity. Notably, this was not a purely passive occurrence but, rather, an active reconfiguration of priorities as the project status shifted from 'Pending Imminent Doom' to 'Effort Accrued Positive Outcome.'

Additionally, my respiration pattern‚Äîpreviously characterized by shallow, erratic breaths‚Äîtransitioned into a more controlled, diaphragmatic sequence, emblematic of the body's shift to a parasympathetic state. This phenomenon was symbolically punctuated by an involuntary sigh, as if my lungs were shedding the weight of procrastination-related guilt.

Interestingly, there was a documented brief resurgence of anxiety, perhaps an aftershock of the prior adrenaline-fueled ordeal. However, its longevity was limited, swiftly overtaken by the amiable arms of mental stillness.

In conclusion, while the mechanistic breakdown of my relief might seem overly thorough, it's pretty enlightening to witness how our bodies and minds collaboratively perform this intricate dance at the crossroads of stress and accomplishment. Next time, I might even allow myself another hour to spare... purely for scientific purposes, of course. ü§ì",3,1748000981.0,feelingsUnderMicrosco,0,1.0,False

Water filters might not be the most exciting items to talk about, but when you're someone like me who‚Äôs constantly filling water bottles or whipping up soups and coffee, a dependable filter matters. The list of compatible refrigerator models is impressively extensive, making it an appealing choice for most LG and Kenmore model users, as shown in the detailed specifications.

**Design and Build Quality**

I can‚Äôt help but appreciate the design of this replacement water filter. The size fits seamlessly into my refrigerator‚Äôs designated slot without a hitch. The precision of its design mimicked the original scale, saving me from fumbling around during installation. Even my not-so-handy self managed to pop it in under five minutes. It also comes with stickers for tracking installation dates, a feature I find surprisingly useful. I tend to lose track of maintenance schedules, but the month stickers keep me on top of replacing filters at the recommended six-month interval.

**Check AQUA CREST AQF-FF46 price on Amazon.**

**Filter Performance**

Filtration efficiency has been my key focus, and this water filter doesn‚Äôt disappoint. It utilizes advanced activated coconut carbon block technology, which acts like a magnet for impurities. I noticed a significant difference in the taste of my water‚Äîit's cleaner, crisper, and free from that faint chlorine smell we‚Äôve all encountered at some point. According to the product specifications, substances like sediments, heavy metals, and VOCs (volatile organic compounds) are also filtered out, and honestly, it‚Äôs reassuring to know my family is drinking safer water.

**Ease of Installation**

If you‚Äôre worried about fiddling with a tricky setup, this replacement filter is extremely user-friendly. Beyond its size-perfect design, the product‚Äôs NSF 42 and NSF 372 certifications speak volumes about both its water filtration capacity and safety standards. It's a plug-and-play deal, which is especially convenient for someone like my sister, who has no patience for any kind of machinery or household appliance maintenance.

**Strengths**

- Provides crisp, clean water free from strange odors and tastes.
- Straightforward installation requiring minimal time or tools.  
- Environmentally conscious design with BPA-free, food-grade materials.  
- Compatible with a broad range of refrigerator models.  

**Shortcomings**

No product hits every mark perfectly, and this filter is no exception. I couldn‚Äôt ignore that its capacity is limited to six months or 200 gallons of use, depending on how much water you consume. While this aligns with standard filters, heavy water users, like my friend's family of five, may find themselves replacing it more frequently. Additionally, it‚Äôs hard to tell when the filter is nearing the end of its lifespan unless you‚Äôve been diligently keeping track with the stickers.

- Limited lifespan (200 gallons), potentially too short for larger households.
- No built-in indicator for needing replacement could lead to overuse.

**Competitive Options**

Comparing this replacement filter to other brands like Waterdrop and Everydrop, it holds its own with strong filtration capabilities and similar certifications. However, the AQUA CREST manages to edge out competitors in design simplicity and ease of installation. Everydrop filters I‚Äôve tested can feel a bit bulkier in the fridge space, while Waterdrop filters might lack the same filtration material quality. That said, certain more premium filters might beat AQUA CREST for ultra-fine particle filtration, albeit at a higher price point.

**Bang for the Buck**

Speaking of price, this is where the AQUA CREST AQF-FF46 shines. Many water filters with comparable features and certifications can cost significantly more. While I can‚Äôt state the exact price due to price fluctuations, it‚Äôs safe to say that this product competes well for what it offers versus its market price. If you‚Äôre looking for reliable filtration without feeling like you‚Äôre overspending, this filter offers excellent value for your money.

There are days where I wake up, put on my gear, and feel like I'm ready to conquer the world... and then there are days where Netflix and my comfy couch win, hands down. 

I always started off super motivated. I'm talking new gym wear, playlist all set, meal prep on point. Like, I wanted to be that person who effortlessly keeps it up and whose exercises are just part of daily life. But then, stress hits or a hectic week comes around, and before I know it, three days have slid by without any sweat involved. 

My best friend seems to have it all figured out. She‚Äôs got this unwavering discipline that I honestly envy so much. I asked her how she does it, and her answer was kinda enlightening. She said it‚Äôs less about motivation and more about creating a habit that's non-negotiable, like brushing teeth or morning coffee. Basically, she made it so much part of her life that skipping it feels weird. 

So, I'm trying a new approach. Instead of aiming for these intense twice-a-day workouts that I burn out from, I'm setting smaller, more manageable goals. Just half an hour of movement a day, whatever I feel like doing. Even a short walk if I'm not up for a full workout.  

I guess the psychology behind it, at least for me, is turning these routines into something not so intimidating and just part of who I am. Like, being consistent doesn't mean being perfect all the time. Starting small and building up seems less overwhelming. ü§û

1kthgmo,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1kthgmo/sf_the_final_correction/,[SF] The Final Correction,"Professor Brown tightened the final screw on the multi-quantum variator and let out a satisfied sigh. He was leaning over a small, gunmetal pod or capsule, with intricate buttons, levers and a key slot. His white lab coat had fresh stains of oil, and hands were soiled in some black liquid. His brow, furrowed in concentration beneath the neat, gray hair, relaxed. He smiled widely and straightened up.

‚ÄòFinally. My life's work is complete.‚Äô Ever since he read the Welles‚Äô ‚ÄòThe Time Machine‚Äô his mind was focused on one goal. To devise a machine that would allow him to fix all the wrongs that plagued society and prevented the people from living full and fruitful lives, free of fear of poverty, oppression, war and exploitation. He took a step back and scrutinized the capsule that contained the sophisticated machinery and an ingenious self contained power source relying on the quantum entanglement through time. 

He looked at his watch and took out his small black, leather-bound notebook. He quickly scribbled ‚Äò06:34 - the project is completed.‚Äô This would be a historic date. He was a great fan of ‚ÄòThe End of Eternity‚Äô and now his mind soared, as he considered how he is going to improve everyone‚Äôs lives.  ‚ÄòA few, well judged corrections here and there and we‚Äôll have global utopia. United Federation of Planets in our lifetime!‚Äô he smiled.

The professor approached the control console and almost started to push the buttons when he paled. ‚ÄòOh my God, I almost forgot!‚Äô he slapped his forehead. He went to his laptop computer and typed in ‚ÄòInitiate‚Äô in the ‚ÄòTemporal Dampener Control‚Äô. The app controlled the special network that held the laboratory isolated from any changes to the timeline he might create. It was akin to Faraday's cage, but for temporal waves. In his lab, he stockpiled several volumes of world history to have a control and comparison reference for his changes. 

Like every good scientist, Professor Brown wanted to document his experiments and to show the people of the beautiful future what pitfalls they avoided thanks to his foresight. He was human after all, and not entirely immune to temptation of glory. While a lesser mind might go to the past carrying the ‚ÄòSports Almanac‚Äô, Brown was above such superficial desire. He wanted only to be recognized as the Benefactor.

The laptop beeped, announcing that Temporal Dampener Field (butterfly net, as the professor half-jokingly referred to it) was operating at 100% capacity. ‚ÄòI am quite sure the very act of activating the machine will cause changes,‚Äô he thought. Professor returned to the console, and revenantly took the key that hung on the chain around his neck. The key slid into the slot and he gently turned it. ‚ÄúWelcome, professor.‚Äù the mechanical voice announced. ‚ÄúStarting diagnostic sequence.‚Äù Brown tapped his foot on the floor. He knew the process would take several minutes, but he couldn‚Äôt wait. He took out his notebook again and scribbled ‚Äò06:49 Machine initiated!!!‚Äô and underlined it.

At that moment the entrance door in the laboratory opened and his assistant Martin entered. When he saw the professor pacing around, he raised eyebrows. ‚ÄúAnother all nighter?‚Äù he asked.

Professor turned, stunned from his thoughts. He didn‚Äôt hear the door open.
‚ÄúOh, it‚Äôs you, Marty.‚Äù he said absentmindedly. ‚ÄúYeah. It‚Äôs done! The diagnostics are just running.‚Äù
‚ÄúGreat. Have you tested it?‚Äù the assistant leaned towards the machine curiously.
‚ÄúI am about to, as soon as the machine starts up. I‚Äôll send this coin to my flat, to the time point two days ago. When the machine works, I'll have it in my pocket.‚Äù
‚ÄúIf it works.‚Äù Marty corrected him.
‚ÄúWhen it works,‚Äù Professor said firmly. ‚ÄúThen, I‚Äôll go myself.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou sure you don‚Äôt want to catch some z‚Äôs? You have time.‚Äù Marty observed ruefully.
‚ÄúHah. That‚Äôs funny. But no. I couldn‚Äôt possibly sleep.‚Äù Professor laughed.
‚ÄúSo, where you gonna go?‚Äù Marty inquired.
‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt it obvious? Munich. November 8th, 1923., 20:30.‚Äù Brown said.
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs there?‚Äù Marty asked.
‚ÄúMarty, Marty. If you are into time travel, you need to know the history. Beer Hall Putsch.‚Äù Brown explained.
‚ÄúOh, you gonna kill Hitler?‚Äù
‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt that the most noble single act one could do?‚Äù Brown asked.
‚ÄúI suppose.‚Äù Marty said wistfully ‚ÄúHe was a pretty bad guy.‚Äù
‚ÄúHe was the worst guy. And I am going to fix him.‚Äù Brown said.
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you-‚Äù Martin started, but a sharp beep interrupted him.

Momentarily, the mechanical voice of the machine announced ‚ÄúDiagnostics complete. Power generation - stable. Quantum variator - Green. Control surfaces - clear. Mirror translator - activated.‚Äù
Brown's face brightened and he smiled triumphantly ‚ÄúSee. It works.‚Äù He quickly scribbled another note into his small book. He approached the machine and with quick movements of his fingers entered the geographic and temporal coordinates of the dining table in his apartment. He put the coin inside and sealed the door. 

‚ÄúObserve, Martin.‚Äù he quietly announced. ‚ÄúThe first time displacement experiment.‚Äù Brown put the hand in his pocket and jokingly asked ‚ÄúWhat does he have in his pocketses?‚Äù and pulled empty palms up. He pressed the button. There was no sound or bright flash of light. Just the mechanical voice that announced ‚ÄúTemporal displacement sequence complete. Feedback - green.‚Äù

Professor reached into his pocket again and this time he retrieved the coin. ‚ÄúMy precious,‚Äù he said in a hoarse, hissing voice.
‚ÄúHow?‚Äù Marty asked, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a magic trick, is it?‚Äù
‚ÄúOf course not. Don‚Äôt take me for the conjurer of cheap tricks.‚Äù and he chuckled ‚ÄúI never get tired of Lord of the Rings quotes. I sent the coin to my apartment two days ago. It materialized on my dinner table. When I got up, I picked it up. And now, it‚Äôs in my pocket.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúOk, that shows it works for inanimate objects. Do we attempt a live test? I mean other than sending you back.‚Äù Martin asked.
‚ÄúOh, right. Good thinking. Bring Bilbo.‚Äù Professor said, motioning towards the door labeled ‚ÄòTest subjects‚Äô.

Minutes later, Marty brought a cage with a small gerbil sniffing around in anticipation. The animal knew he‚Äôd be getting some tasty cheese each time his habitat was moved to this room. Professor leaned towards the cage and in a gentle, affectionate voice said ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry Bilbo. You‚Äôd be back in no time.‚Äù He chuckled at the pun. Bilbo meeped, sniffing. Taking the cage from Marty, he placed it on the narrow bench inside the capsule and strapped it carefully. 

‚ÄúOk, where do we send a cage with a gerbil in it, but where it won‚Äôt attract undue attention?‚Äù Professor mused. ‚ÄúWhere?‚Äù
‚ÄúEr, Prof, may I suggest the pet shop across the street?‚Äù Marty volunteered.
‚ÄúBrilliant.‚Äù Professor said ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôd I be without you?‚Äù and he high-fived the assistant. ‚ÄúNow, go there and find some inconspicuous spot, send me the coordinates and wait.‚Äù
‚ÄúAnd if it‚Äôs not empty?‚Äù Marty frowned.
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry. I‚Äôve got it covered. The Temporal Pilot field will make sure the coordinates are empty or move the translation laterally until it finds adequate space nearby. That‚Äôs what the Mirror Translators are there for.‚Äù
‚ÄúOk, Prof. See you in fifteen minutes.‚Äù 

Marty arrived at the shop. It was early in the day and the shop was virtually empty, except for the clerk. He nodded to the clerk, murmuring ‚ÄúJust want to look around, thank you.‚Äù at the offer of assistance. Immediately he found a perfect spot, behind the shelves holding the turtle terrariums and gerbils meeping happily inside the glass enclosures. He placed his phone on the floor and marked the coordinates. He clicked share and waited. Then he blinked and when he opened his eyes, the cage was on the floor in front of him, Bilbo meeping quietly. He didn‚Äôt seem any worse for the wear.

Marty picked up the cage and walked towards the exit. Suddenly, he heard the alarmed voice of the clerk ‚ÄúHey, man! Hey!‚Äù. Marty turned towards the counter. 
‚ÄúWhere do you think you‚Äôre taking the animal and the cage?‚Äù the clerk asked. ‚ÄúThis is not an animal shelter. We sell those, you know.‚Äù
‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶ But it‚Äôs mine!‚Äù Marty stuttered.
‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt have it with you when you came in, did you now?‚Äù the clerk asked. He was confused. He clearly remembered when Marty arrived. Or did he? He missed the coffee this morning.
‚ÄúI did.‚Äù Marty insisted. ‚ÄòI did not see this coming.‚Äô he almost chuckled.
The clerk approached and scrutinized the cage. He shook his head. ‚ÄúI must be confused. We don‚Äôt have that type of cage on inventory. And that animal looks quite older than a few weeks.‚Äù The clerk closed his eyes for a few seconds, obviously trying to recollect the moments when Marty entered the shop. He shook his head again. ‚ÄúI guess I was absorbed in thoughts. I apologize. Did you find a toy for him?‚Äù
Marty breathed again. ‚ÄúNo, no. Thank you.‚Äù
‚ÄúMy pleasure. See you.‚Äù Clerk said, waving his hand.
‚ÄòThis was close,‚Äô Marty thought. ‚ÄòWe really should be more careful.‚Äô He hurried back to the lab.

‚ÄúProf, I‚Äôve got him.‚Äù he said breathlessly as he entered the lab.
‚ÄúI never doubted you would,‚Äù The professor said matter-of-factly.
‚ÄúProf!‚Äù Marty gasped ‚ÄúWhat are you wearing?‚Äù

The professor stood in a dark suit that surely went out of fashion centuries ago. He politely picked the fedora hat and bowed. In a mock German accent he said ‚ÄúProfezor Braun. At zee serfice.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Marty gasped again.
‚ÄúDo you think I‚Äôd fit in 1923?‚Äù Professor asked cheerfully.
‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶‚Äù Marty realized. ‚ÄúSure. You are a spitting image of a professor in 1920‚Äôs Germany.‚Äù Marty said approvingly.
‚ÄúProf. Look. Before the machine interrupted me, I wanted to ask you. Do you think you really thought this through?‚Äù Marty asked, cautiously.
‚ÄúWhat? Don‚Äôt be silly. I‚Äôve read the ‚ÄúBeer Hall Putsch: History and Legacy of Adolf Hitler‚Äù. I know precisely where he‚Äôd be and where I am going to-‚Äù Brown started to explain in a blizzard of words.
‚ÄúNo, prof. I mean, like really thought it all through?‚Äù Marty tried again.
‚ÄúOf course. What could go wrong? I whack Hitler, there is no nazism. QED.‚Äù Brown explained gently. ‚ÄúBut I appreciate the concern, Marty.‚Äù
‚ÄúWell, you minored history. I am just a poor, ignorant engineer. What do I know?‚Äù Marty agreed reluctantly.
‚ÄúTrust me. I know what I‚Äôm doing.‚Äù Brown said. ‚ÄúAfter all, only good things can happen if there is no Hitler to mess history up.‚Äù
‚ÄúAnd you are sure you‚Äôd be able to pull the trigger?‚Äù Marty asked, seeing the prof pocketing a small Walther pistol. ‚ÄúWhere did you get that thing at all?‚Äù
‚ÄúAh, this? In a pawn shop, believe it or not. And it won‚Äôt just be me. 50 million people died because of Hitler. Their ghosts will pull the trigger. I‚Äôll be little more than the instrument of their revenge.‚Äù Brown said solemnly.
‚ÄúOk, but what about security? I mean, certainly Hitler had people protecting him?‚Äù Marty said apprehensively.
‚ÄúNormally, yes. But the night I‚Äôm going to ambush him, he won‚Äôt. You see, the Nazi procession would just have been broken by‚Ä¶ or is going to be broken by police when I get there. He‚Äôd be alone, injured and wandering towards the house of his close friend, Hanfaestengl. I‚Äôll intercept him in a dark alley and shoot him.‚Äù Brown elaborated.

With those words, the professor turned and with firm, decisive steps walked to the machine. He opened the compartment, once more felt the cold steel of the pistol in his pocket, entered and strapped in. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to do anything. I‚Äôve put it all in the app on my phone. I can control the machine remotely.‚Äù 

He closed the hatch. The console blinked. As Marty turned to look through the window, he saw the view changed. His eyes widened when he saw the landscape was filled with rows of multistory concrete buildings. ‚ÄòWhat happened to the campus?‚Äô he thought disturbed. After Marty approached the window, he saw a disturbing sight. At the intersection there was a roundabout. Its center was occupied not by a traffic cop, but with a marble statue of a man in a fedora hat, with undefined facial features. He took a binocular and looked at the inscription engraved at the base of the monument. 

‚ÄòTo the unknown Hero Of The Order of Lenin
Peoples of the world are eternally
grateful for your actions on October 26th, Year 17 Before Soviet Era‚Äô
World Soviet, May 1st, Year 50 Soviet Era.
Commissioned by General Secretary
Yakov Josifovich Dzugashvili

‚ÄòOh my God!‚Äô Marty thought. ‚ÄúOh, Holy Jesus!‚Äù He choked. He saw a patrol of four uniformed figures marching in goose-step down the street. The people made way for them in an apparently terrified state.

The machine beeped and the hatch opened with a hiss. Professor emerged from inside, the small pistol in his hand still smoking. ‚ÄúDid I succeed?‚Äù he asked without much introduction.
‚ÄúOh, yes. I've noticed that you did.‚Äù Marty observed, sarcastically.
‚ÄúWhy, what is it?‚Äù Professor inquired urgently, seeing the pale face of his assistant.
‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs best you come here and have a look.‚Äù
The professor left the fedora and the overcoat at the table and approached the window with wobbling steps. Even before he reached the opening, he could see that the view had changed.
‚ÄúWhat is this-‚Äù and his eyes caught the monument.
‚ÄúAh. Yes. They erected a monument for you. The workers of the world are eternally grateful.‚Äù Marty said.
Professor slapped his forehead. ‚ÄúI forgot Stalin!‚Äù he said. He turned and entered the machine. Marty shouted ‚ÄúNoooo!‚Äù but the hatch closed. Marty turned again and the landscape slightly changed. The buildings were decrepit, and he saw some windows were broken. ‚ÄòWhat did you do, prof?‚Äô he thought. He looked at the monument. He saw it now resembled Stalin. He picked the binoculars up again and zoomed to the base.

‚ÄòJosif Visarionovich Stalin, 61 BSE - 15 BSE
The Vozhd of the World Soviet, struck down by cowardly assassin‚Äô
Monument Commissioned by
L. P. Beria, Chairman of World Presidium

The machine beeped, but Marty barely noticed. He stood at the window as the professor joined him. ‚ÄúWhat now?‚Äù he asked.
‚ÄúWell, now you‚Äôre a wanted criminal.‚Äù Marty said, his voice trembling.
‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Professor demanded. Instead of answering, Marty just pointed at the monument.
‚ÄúOh, no!‚Äù Professor whispered. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve made a martyr of Stalin?‚Äù Marty nodded gravely.
‚ÄúI must fix this.‚Äù And Brown hurried to the machine again.
‚ÄúWait.‚Äù Marty‚Äôs desperate shriek followed him as the hatch closed.
When Marty looked through the window again, he saw that the laboratory was surrounded by the trimmed grass and orderly rows of trees. A few figures reverently cut the grass, and one, dressed in black held a commanding view at a small hillock, previously occupied by the monuments. There was no roundabout nor roads in evidence and only a stretch of rails ran by the building, disappearing into the distance.

Marty picked up the binoculars, hoping that this was a nicer outcome than the professor's interventions wrought. When the lens of binoculars zoomed in on the tranquil scene, he realized the depth of his mistake. The figure on the hillock wore a black, fitting uniform, with a red band and white circle on the arm. ‚ÄòNo! Can‚Äôt be nazis?‚Äô he thought in shock. He looked at the figures and saw they wore pyjama-like uniforms, sneaking terrified glances at the guard standing on the hillock.

Already familiar beep sounded again, followed by the hiss of the hatch. ‚ÄúHow does it look now?‚Äù The Professor's voice echoed again.
‚ÄúProfessor‚Ä¶‚Äù Marty started, just as Brown reached the window opening.
‚ÄúHey, this looks nice. Look at the dedication of those gardeners‚Ä¶‚Äù He blurted.
Marty handed him the binoculars, without a word. As Brown put them to his eyes, his face paled. ‚ÄúBut Nazis???‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAg- again?‚Äù he stammered.

Marty approached him and shook him by the shoulders. ‚ÄúYou maniac. What did you do?‚Äù
‚ÄúI-‚Äù Brown started ‚ÄúI‚Äôve killed Marx.‚Äù
‚ÄúMarx? Which one?‚Äù Marty asked.
‚ÄúKarl Marx.‚Äù
‚ÄúHow much thought have you put into it?‚Äù Marty asked.
‚ÄúActually a lot. I‚Äôve figured that it‚Äôs obviously Marxism that is wrong.‚Äù Brown said. ‚ÄúBut it seems that Germany is also‚Ä¶‚Äù and Brown bolted to the capsule again.
‚ÄúProfessor!‚Äù Marty found himself screaming. Again. ‚ÄòI just can‚Äôt stop him.‚Äô Marty thought. ‚ÄòHe's a man possessed.‚Äô Resignedly, he moved to the window pane again. He saw massive, baroque buildings instead of orderly forest and captives tending the grass. When he used his binoculars on the nearest building, Marty was able to read the plaque that said ‚ÄúFranco-Prussian War Memorial‚Äù - ""Building dedicated to the Glorious Victory of the Second Empire of France over Prussia‚Äù - To our American friends construction was commissioned by Napoleon VII Bonaparte, Emperor of Mexico, Africa and Eastern Asia, 1970.‚Äù

He switched on the TV and plugged the antenna in. He switched channels until he found the news. Just as he started to watch, a beep sounded and a hatch opened. Professor got out. Marty turned to him. ‚ÄúWell, at least it seems you didn‚Äôt make it worse this time around.‚Äù Marty said. ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt really see the negatives from the window, but I think we can use the TV. Just tuned in to some kind of news channel.‚Äù

‚ÄòBreaking news‚Äô logos in English and French flashed on screen. A martial sounding music roared. ‚ÄúAnd then again, maybe I haven‚Äôt seen everything.‚Äù Marty observed apprehensively.
‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs just the way this news channel likes its announcements.‚Äù Professor observed.
‚ÄúMaybe.‚Äù Marty commented doubtfully. ‚ÄúGiven that the world appears dominated by Napoleonic France, I wouldn‚Äôt hope too much.‚Äù

Presently, the music ended and the image changed to a video recorded by a shaking camera somewhere in the jungle. Voiceover said ‚ÄúJoint forces of the Second Empire of France and United Empire of North America and British Isles, have cleared the surroundings of the city of Hanoi from the so-called Free Vietnam forces. This brings this 40 years long war near to conclusion, according to the press report by the Joint South East Asia Expeditionary force. This represents the most significant defeat of the self-proclaimed Freedom League of Southeast Asia since the Battle of Phnom Penh five years ago. In other news, the major militant union organization of Central African miners has again attempted to incite a general strike in copper mines-‚Äù

‚ÄúI knew I was wrong. It looked too good.‚Äù Marty said.
‚ÄúOh dear Time!‚Äù the professor started ‚ÄúWhat is going on?‚Äù
‚ÄúProfessor, each of your interventions has so far only made things worse.‚Äù Marty said.
‚ÄúImpossible. There must be a factor unaccounted for.‚Äù Professor protested.
‚ÄúNO!‚Äù Marty shouted. ‚ÄúThere is only one factor - you. You and that infernal machine.‚Äù 
‚ÄúYou are overreacting. That machine is currently our only way to find an acceptable timeline.‚Äù
‚ÄúThere won‚Äôt be any.‚Äù Marty uttered, exasperated. ‚ÄúEach of your attempts rewrites history.‚Äù
‚ÄúWell, if I remove all the malevolent influences, I‚Äôll create an ideal timeline.‚Äù Professor observed.
‚ÄúWhat will make you stop?‚Äù Marty wailed in despair.
‚ÄúI must complete what I started. I can‚Äôt stop now. Leave the world in this state?‚Äù
‚ÄúBut if the next iteration is even worse?‚Äù Marty retorted.
‚ÄúI am willing to take that risk.‚Äù Professor countered emphatically. 

Marty sat down in the chair. His mind raced in circles. To stop now, would cement the reality in this current dystopia. The brief and superficial acquaintance with it indicated that beneath untold horrors lurked, which they had no concept of. On one hand, the professor was right. On the other - he was willing to risk it? He? But what about all the uncounted billions who perhaps were not willing to take that risk?

‚ÄúProf,‚Äù he tried to reason, ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt you go back? Undo the changes?‚Äù
‚ÄúOh, Marty. I wish I could. But the past is so scrambled now, rewritten so many times.‚Äù Professor said quietly. ‚ÄúThe only anchor points lay in the past, which we-‚Äù
‚ÄúYou. Leave me out of this.‚Äù Marty protested.
‚ÄúOk. Have it your way.‚Äù Professor agreed, ‚ÄúWhich I haven‚Äôt touched yet.‚Äù
‚ÄúOh, do what you want. I won‚Äôt have any part in it.‚Äù Marty said resignedly.
‚ÄúWill you at least observe the changes?‚Äù Professor pleaded, ‚ÄúIt would help me a lot.‚Äù

I get out of bed, I walk to my office where we keep the dog at night. As I approach I hear him scramble out of the on-the-back-legs-in-the-air position he loves to sleep in and hear him give his morning shake off. I open the door where I‚Äôm greeted with a big stretch back and a big stretch forward, always into me so I can pet him and acknowledge, as all owners do, how big those stretches were while telling him ‚ÄúGood morning! Wanna go outside?‚Äù I let him out in the backyard. As he takes his morning pee and does a quick patrol around the yard for any lizards that dare venture onto his land, I fill his water and prepare his morning meal. 

He was smart, smart enough to know how long it typically takes me to do these things. And in a way, I was part of his morning routine because he always came rushing in after the same amount time had passed. On the rare occasion I took longer than normal he would let me know to hurry up with a sharp bark and a tail wag. Anyway, as he ate I would start my coffee and prep his meds. Meds meant treat and that was ALWAYS served promptly after he finished eating. If you took too long he‚Äôd bark and howl and even sometimes nudge you to get a move on. 

As I finish my coffee he runs to the bedroom door to give it a punch and a happy howl to wake up his favorite human, Mom. Depending on her schedule I tell him to hush, to which he lies down and waits patiently, or I tell him, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm coming, be patient.‚Äù I barely get the door cracked open before he barrels through and run-jumps on the bed to wake her up with his alarm of a thousand licks.

[DOE Loan Programs: Actions Needed to Address Authority and Improve Application Reviews | U.S. GAO](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-25-106631)

**What GAO Found**

The Department of Energy (DOE) is to provide loans and loan guarantees for innovative and other high-impact energy-related ventures through its Loan Programs Office (office). In recent years, Congress added two new loan programs and hundreds of billions of dollars in new loan authority for the office to manage. At the same time, the number of applications for loans and guarantees increased substantially. In response, the office increased its staff from 104 in 2020 to 412 in 2024, and made organizational changes, among other actions.

The office is not on track to issue loans in the amounts Congress authorized. A key example of this is the Energy Infrastructure Reinvestment Program. Enacted in August 2022, it received $250 billion in loan authority due to expire September 30, 2026. However, as of September 30, 2024, the office had made one loan for about $1.4 billion. While it has a total of $108.3 billion in outstanding submitted applications for loans and guarantees, the program almost certainly will fall short of the $250 billion in loan authority. Further, DOE needs to thoroughly review the current applications to ensure the government's interests are protected.

**Department of Energy (DOE) Loan Programs Office Loan and Loan Guarantee Application Process**

However, the office cannot ensure consistent and accurate application reviews. For example, their guidance is at times incorrect and outdated. In several instances, the guidance refers to documents that officials said are no longer used, and it is at times contradictory or unclear. As a result, staff would likely find it difficult to follow the correct practice. Further, GAO found that the office's guidance does not always follow the law. For projects that are required to be innovative, the office determines innovativeness early in the application review process and risks issuing a guarantee for a project that is no longer innovative. Without confirming innovativeness when it offers conditional commitment, the office may make loans or guarantees for projects that are not eligible.

Finally, the office does not comprehensively evaluate its application review process, including whether guidance is up to date, because officials have not considered the application review process to be high risk. Conducting a comprehensive annual review of this process could help the office identify and correct errors to better ensure it is consistently and accurately reviewing applications. Without correcting its guidance, the office cannot be assured that application reviews lead to selecting projects that further program goals.

**Why GAO Did This Study**

The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (2021) and the Inflation Reduction Act (2022) added two new loan programs to the three in DOE's portfolio. The additions increased the office's available loan authority many times over, bringing it to over $400 billion. Much of this authority expires in 2026 and 2028.

Congress provided in statute for GAO to review DOE's Loan Guarantee Program. GAO's scope for its report is the five loan programs administered by the office. The report examines (1) how the office has addressed the expansion of its loan programs and loan authority; and (2) the extent to which the office's application review guidance and procedures ensure consistent and accurate application reviews.

GAO analyzed DOE actions to address an increase in applications. GAO also identified the extent to which DOE was planning to use the amount of its loan authority. It also reviewed application review guidance, documentation, and training, and interviewed DOE officials.

# MAY 23RD, 2025 The Rare Earth Bottleneck

[The Rare Earth Bottleneck - Christopher A. McNally - CHINA US Focus](https://www.chinausfocus.com/finance-economy/the-rare-earth-bottleneck)

**China‚Äôs new export licensing system strengthens its control over key rare earth elements, deepening supply chain risks. Although new processing facilities are emerging abroad, they won‚Äôt soon offset China‚Äôs dominance, prolonging global uncertainty.**

https://preview.redd.it/192d64kxdi2f1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f5f9f0b60b45d5dd683160fd8344135c0b1de79

On April 4, 2025, China announced the establishment of a new licensing system for the export of certain rare earth oxides, alloys, and magnets. Specifically, the new export licenses apply to 7 of 17 rare earth elements (REEs), all of which are medium and heavy rare earths: samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium, and yttrium.

As the new restrictions were announced, the initial interpretation was that they were in direct retaliation for U.S. tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump days earlier. But the establishment of this system was likely in the works for some time and is dictated by different time constraints than Trump‚Äôs trade war. In fact, there remains much confusion as to what exactly is happening in the rare earth trade and where things could be headed.

Perhaps the least understood aspect is how a crucial input that sustains global supply chains across industries faces a pronounced supply choke point. In other words, without critical rare earth materials, industries from semiconductors to electric vehicles, robotics, drones, aerospace, and defense could come to a halt.

https://preview.redd.it/eefblbk1ei2f1.png?width=688&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5b69cdd3ee861e30f162c8f6b3ab4fc9e4d26ee

First, a short primer on REEs. Rare earths, despite their name, are not particularly rare at all. They are commonly found in the earth‚Äôs crust, as U.S. President Trump‚Äôs interests express: Greenland, Ukraine, Canada . . . But China remains by far the largest miner of REEs, mining over 270,000 metric tons in 2024. This accounted for 69% of all rare earth mining production, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The United States is a distant second with 11%, and Myanmar with 8% of mined rare earths that year.

But the chokepoint is not mining. Gradually more and more mines have been developed or reopened across the globe, including in Australia, Myanmar, Vietnam, and the United States. For example, the United States mined 45,000 metric tons of rare earths in 2024, up from 41,600 in 2023. There is a single active rare earth mine in the United States, in Mountain Pass, California. That mine used to produce most of the world‚Äôs supply of REEs from the 1960s until 1995. However, after Chinese production soared and its exports poured into global markets, Mountain Pass closed in 2002, only to reopen again with government support in 2017.

Despite Mountain Pass‚Äô sizeable production, China remains the destination for some of its rare earth concentrates, especially heavy ones. The U.S. often ships raw mineral precursors to China for processing and re-imports them as components. By now there are processing facilities in the U.S. for light rare earths, especially neodymium and praseodymium, the most common materials used to make rare earth magnets.

Despite U.S. advances, the heavy rare earths chokepoint remains. Up until 2023, there was minimal output from a refinery in Vietnam. Yet, this sole facility outside China is closed due to a tax dispute, effectively giving China a monopoly over heavy REE processing‚Äîat least for the time being.

Japan has perfected the recycling of REEs from used electronics, but that supply remains limited. In the United States, MP Materials, the owner of the Mountain Pass mine, is moving forward with a processing facility for heavy REEs. However, despite investing nearly $1 billion since 2020, the company currently cannot process heavy REEs. In prior announcements, the company aimed for its first processing runs during 2026.

Therefore, the earliest rival supply to emerge will be from Lynas Rare Earths Corp., an Australian company with a processing facility in Kuantan, Malaysia. On May 15, 2025 Lynas Malaysia announced it had commenced its first production of separated heavy rare earths, specifically dysprosium oxide (Dy). The facility is also scheduled to begin production of terbium (Tb) in June 2025.

Dysprosium and terbium are especially critical components in the manufacturing of high-performance rare earth magnets that can operate in high temperatures, with uses in all types of advanced electronic equipment, including micro-capacitors. Since the demand for such applications is increasing rapidly, even with rival supply, Chinese dominance will remain for years to come.

Consequently, a point of failure will remain in the supply chain for rare earth magnet production outside of China. This highlights another important facet of the REE value chain: China produces more than 90 percent of permanent REE magnets, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. One possibility is therefore that Beijing could halt the export of heavy REE oxides, only to further Chinese dominance in global REE magnet production.

Currently, industry insiders outside of China expect export shortages to emerge during the summer if no or very few licenses are issued.¬†[A Reuters report in mid-May 2025](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/beijing-has-issued-first-rare-earth-magnet-export-permits-volkswagen-suppliers-2025-05-13/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)¬†affirmed that China was already issuing export permits for magnets containing medium and heavy rare earths. This included licenses for at least four magnet producers, including suppliers to Volkswagen, the German carmaker. Volkswagen had reportedly lobbied Beijing for help on this.

The permits issued so far seem only to be for suppliers shipping to customers in Europe and Vietnam. Under the terms of the 90-day de-escalation of the U.S.-China trade war agreed to in Geneva, China said it would suspend or cancel its non-tariff countermeasures imposed on the United States since April 2. Some analyses contend that removing restrictions on the seven heavy REEs was a priority for U.S. negotiators.

Nonetheless, neither side has mentioned when REEs will begin flowing to the United States. The permitting system China has implemented to control the export of rare earths, which applies to all countries, will be retained. However, it might become easier for U.S. buyers to win approvals. Elon Musk has reportedly said that Tesla had already been in talks with Beijing over licenses for its Optimus robots.

This only serves to drive home how pronounced the heavy REE choke point is now that Beijing has implemented an export licensing system. It gives China control over the supply chains of virtually every high-tech product on earth with Western industrialized nations uniquely vulnerable.

https://preview.redd.it/nzp8deh4ei2f1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=f849777071773027011abd252099ad8a3612a57d

Although new supply is slated to come on stream during 2025 and 2026 in Malaysia and the United States, it will be insufficient to meet global demand. Even further off are mines and processing facilities in regions coveted by U.S. President Trump, such as Greenland and Ukraine. Ukraine is a case in point. It will take years to develop mines and refineries there, with the average REE facility requiring 18 years to become operational.

After all, rare earths are not particularly rare, but separating them is devilishly challenging. Different REEs are merely fractions of an angstrom apart in diameter, making it very difficult to separate using physical means. Tellingly, dysprosium, infamous for its elusive presence, is named after the Greek ‚Äúdysprositos,‚Äù meaning ‚Äúhard to get.‚Äù

As rival facilities in Malaysia and the U.S. slowly come online, Beijing‚Äôs licensing system will nonetheless tighten its hold on global supply. A prolonged phase of uncertainty awaits while the choke point remains‚Äîand with it, a reminder that in modern industrial competition, access may matter far more than abundance.

* Initial funding of $25 billion proposed, with total costs estimated at $175 billion (though likely much higher)
* Promises ‚Äúclose to 100% protection‚Äù, but the timeline of 2.5-3 years appears unrealistic

**Technical Challenges:**¬†The scale required is enormous ‚Äì physicists estimate needing 16,000 to 36,000+ space-based interceptors just to defend against a small North Korean missile salvo, depending on response time requirements and geographic coverage.

**Strategic Context:**¬†The system responds to evolving threats from hypersonic and fractional orbital missiles that can approach from unexpected directions, unlike traditional over-the-pole trajectories that current defences target.

Nowadays, it's common to see over 100 applicants for a single position.

It seems that in the past, people were more content living in smaller towns, working stable jobs like accounts payable, and gradually moving up to roles like staff accountant. But when I was in college, even the students with the weakest r√©sum√©s were applying to Big 4 firms in the largest cities.

What's interesting is that despite skyrocketing unaffordability, more and more people continue to move into major urban centers. That feels counterintuitive, especially considering that remote work and affordability should logically encourage people to live elsewhere.

It makes me wonder if there's a generational shift happening are younger people more drawn to a certain kind of lifestyle? The appeal of $6 coffees, high-rise condos, city jobs, and expensive corporate dinners seems stronger than ever.

I'm looking to vanquish my inner old man and do something adventurous for once. Hopefully you can help with that! It's fair to say I'm pretty bloody *sensible*. But, every now and again, I have that little voice in my head that says I should go a bit wild and have some fun. So here I am!

I'm pretty open-minded in terms of where this goes and what I'm looking for. Anything from chats, meeting up for a drink/coffee, and, if there's a spark, then a lot more besides. There's life in the ol' dog yet.

A few bits about me: I work a senior finance job in London, which, while stressful, is not too bad most of time. That said, I do like to enjoy myself outside of work as much as I can. I'm a bit of music nerd and really enjoy discovering new bands/sounds. If you have any absolute jams, then please bestow them upon me. My body is ready. I also write my own music when I'm feeling inspired, so maybe I can write about how debaucherous this goes (or not).

Other than that, I enjoy video games, running (when my body co-operates), reading, and gentle strolls in the many wonderful London parks. I'm a bit like an 80 year old trapped in a 34 year old body. Torture, really.

## Key Features Analysis

The Subzero water filter boasts several noteworthy features that contribute to its superior performance and make it a top contender in the water filtration market.**Multi-Stage Filtration:**
Each Subzero filter employs a elegant multi-stage filtration process. this typically includes a sediment filter, pre-carbon filter, reverse osmosis membrane, and a post-carbon filter. Each stage is designed to target specific types of contaminants, maximizing the overall effectiveness of the filtration system. This thorough approach ensures that a broad spectrum of impurities are removed, providing clean and safe drinking water.

**Reverse Osmosis Technology:**
The core of the Subzero filter is its advanced reverse osmosis (RO) membrane. This membrane effectively removes dissolved solids, heavy metals, and other undesirable substances from the water.The RO process forces water through a semi-permeable membrane, leaving contaminants behind. This results in water that is both pure and refreshing, substantially improving taste and overall quality.

**Smart Monitoring System:**
Many modern Subzero filters are equipped with smart monitoring systems. These systems track water quality, filter lifespan, and system performance. Utilizing sensors and microprocessors, these systems provide real-time data on the filter's efficiency, alerting users when filter replacements are needed or when the system requires maintenance. This ensures optimal performance and prolongs the lifespan of the filter.

**High Flow Rate:**
Despite its advanced filtration capabilities, the Subzero filter is designed to deliver a high flow rate. This ensures that users don't experience a significant reduction in water pressure while filtering their water. High flow rates are particularly important in households with multiple users or in commercial settings where a constant supply of clean water is essential.**Durable Construction:**
Subzero filters are built to last, using high-quality materials and robust construction techniques. The filter housings are made from durable plastics or stainless steel, designed to withstand everyday wear and tear. This ensures the filter remains reliable and effective for years.

Key features of the Subzero Water Filter include:

*   Advanced filtration technology
*   Real-time monitoring systems
*   Robust and reliable design
*   Efficient operation

**Cost Savings:** While the initial investment might seem significant, Subzero filters prove economical over time, reducing the need for bottled water and minimizing water-related appliance repairs. The elimination of bottled water expenses results in substantial savings, while cleaner water also prolongs the lifespan of water-using appliances such as coffee machines and refrigerators with ice makers.

## FAQs Section

**How often do I need to replace the filters in my Subzero water filter system?**
Filter replacement frequency depends on water usage and incoming water quality.Typically,sediment and carbon pre-filters should be replaced every 6-12 months,the reverse osmosis membrane every 2-3 years,and the post-carbon filter annually. The smart monitoring system will alert you when replacements are due.

**Can the Subzero water filter remove fluoride?**
Yes, the reverse osmosis membrane in the Subzero water filter effectively removes fluoride from the water supply. This makes Subzero filters a suitable choice for individuals who wish to reduce their fluoride intake.

**Is professional installation required for a Subzero water filter?**
While some users might prefer professional installation,many Subzero filters are designed for DIY installation. The included manual provides clear, step-by-step instructions, and basic plumbing skills are usually sufficient. However, if you're uncomfortable with plumbing work, professional installation is recommended.

I can paint and do house chores, heck... I'll babysit for ya, I'm great with kids. Need a new countertop? Ask me for pics/info about the custom resin counters my wife and I pour. 

I'll clean up all spent casings and treat your property with the upmost respect as if it were my own. I'd like to bring my wife or brother on occasion. I'd never mention where you lived to anyone else. Respecting your property/privacy is very important to me. 

Id like to shoot 9mm/22lr/.556/12g. I grew up respecting and using firearms safely and carefully. I'm ccw certified and will provide valid ID as well as a copy of my clean background check from the courthouse. I can provide a long list of character references as well.

Well I dreamed I lived in a city which is in real life hundreds of miles from my hometown. Let¬¥s call it BigCity. I had an invitation to visit my friend Susan in 22 Side Road. Leaving home I couldn¬¥t keep my cat Muffy from coming with, so together we walked all the way across the city to my friend¬¥s house. Susan was having a lot of guests, because her aunt just died and everyone was there for condolences. I barely knew her aunt, but as a friend I did well supporting her managing snacks and drinks and tissues. Well, Muffy remained calm and did a great job soothing some of the other guests.

  
Several hours later it was time for me to go. I hugged my friend goodbye and called out for my cat. When I opened the door Muffy got nervous and ran away. Oh my gosh! Cars are driving down the road, there are way more people in the street than before when we arrived, kids are starting fireworks at the corner. Muffy!! She¬¥s never been here before and it¬¥s a long way from home. So much noise. So much going on. Of course I try to grab her, but every time she just runs further from me until she disappears into the park across the street, diagonally opposite to Susan¬¥s house.

  
I follow while trying to call a cab. Instead of just dialing the number I try to type in ""taxi park..."" \[in the dream I knew the name of the park, but forgot after waking up\], but I can¬¥t see too much on the display \[like yesterday when I had a migrane\]. So, I can¬¥t reach Muffy, cannot call a cab, looking for my cat, trouble focussing on my phone, asking people for my cat..... and finally I found her, held her in my arms and we both safely got on the taxi that stood - thank god! - right in front of the park.

We got home and somehow I even managed to pay the driver and finally I woke up. End of dream.

  
Now I got up and during coffee I got curious if there actually is a Side Road in BigCity. So I searched the internet. Well, yes. There is. That neighbourhood even seems to look similar to the one in my dream. Also there¬¥s a park - in the exact same angle diagonally opposite of number 22. Get¬¥s weirder: in this real life number 22 lives someone with the name Suzanne. 

I still could describe exactly how Susan looked, but irl I¬¥ve never met her. I¬¥m also most definitely sure I¬¥ve never been to that neighbourhood in my whole life. By the way, Muffy is fine and taking a nap right now in my lap while typing this.",1,1747999529.0,DreamInterpretation,0,1.0,False

Here‚Äôs what happened üëá

**Context**  
I‚Äôve been in the online game for a while:  
‚Üí Launched several e-commerce stores  
‚Üí Co-founded a marketing agency  
‚Üí Helped brands scale using digital tools

But a 1-month business trip to Germany taught me something powerful about local.

**Setup**  
Every morning, I visited the same cozy coffee shop.  
After a few days, I started chatting with the owner.

He asked me: ‚ÄúWhat do you do?‚Äù  
I explained: ‚ÄúI help businesses grow by listening to customers and acting fast.‚Äù

**The Question**  
I asked him one simple question:  
üëâ ‚ÄúHave you ever asked your customers what you could improve?‚Äù

He said:

>

That was my moment to help.

**The Setup**  
I offered to set something up ‚Äî fast.

‚úÖ In 1 hour, we:

* Built a quick landing page for feedback
* Linked it to a QR code at the counter
* Set up emails and SMS automation using AI tools

**The Result**  
Three days later:  
üì© 200+ reviews.  
üí¨ Tons of feedback.  
üìá Plus emails and phone numbers.

I ran the reviews through GPT and asked:

>

**The Insight**  
The #1 complaint?  
üìâ 50% of reviews mentioned slow WiFi.

The same day, the owner called his internet provider and upgraded the speed.  
üìà Small move, fast action.

**The Win**  
We emailed all 200 people:

>

üöÄ The next day at 11am, 20 people showed up to work from the caf√©.

Real people. Real impact. Real fast.

**The Lesson**  
üí° Local businesses don‚Äôt need huge marketing budgets.  
They need:

* Feedback loops
* Smart tools
* Fast execution

At first I thought he might be ISTJ, because he has very strong habits. For example, he always gets up at 6 in the morning, even on weekends when he has nothing to do. He says he's just used to it. Furthermore, he never eats breakfast; He only drinks his usual coffee, as part of an almost unalterable ritual.

He is a fairly reserved person, very calm and likes to spend time alone. But what catches my attention the most is that, despite his seemingly routine profile, in his free time he likes to investigate things. I have seen him read books on engineering, construction, even psychology. He loves DIY shows and also doctor series. It's as if he enjoys learning for the simple fact of knowing, without needing to apply it directly. That's why I also think it may be an enneatype 5, because it places a special value on knowledge. He even likes skulls because, according to him, they remind him of human wisdom. It seemed like a very profound phrase to me.

With me, as a father, he was never very affectionate. He was rather cold and distant, but I wouldn't say he was a bad father. He instilled a lot of discipline in me. He wanted me to be a studious child, to have a future. I remember that once, when I was little, I said something like ‚ÄúI don't like studying‚Äù and he got very upset. For him, that was unthinkable.

He also does sports; He likes to run, and although he doesn't show it too much, he has a great love for animals. Sometimes I feel like he is more empathetic with them than with people.

I once asked him if he liked to plan things, and I was surprised by his answer. He told me no, he doesn't even know what he's going to do tomorrow. That left me very confused, because I swore he was an IXTJ, someone more structured. Also, when we talked about routines, he himself told me that being too boxy doesn't help, which also goes a little against the stereotype he had of TJ types.

And although he is usually very realistic, I have realized that sometimes he is able to see beyond the obvious. He has moments where his gaze goes much deeper, as if he connected with something more abstract.

All of this makes me wonder if he really is an ISTJ or if he could be an ISFP or some other type. I am an INFP, and I have a tertiary Si function, and he has even criticized that structured way of being, which confuses me even more. What do you think? ",2,1747999260.0,mbti,6,1.0,False

* review items for today in planner (which stores all information for the future) while coffee is brewing

the reason that there is already a line through today's date is that it was blank, but then, skeptical (bc i rarely have completely blank days), i checked the fridge and, indeed, my chicken expires tomorrow which means that i might want to go to the grocery today instead of having to do both the grocery and cooking tomorrow.

however, tomorrow being saturday makes doing both much easier than on a weekday so i penciled the grocery in during 'me time' (11am) today until i get through reviewing the remaining todo items for today.

actually, another consideration is whether i have to make two grocery stops or just one. let's check my shopping list:

https://preview.redd.it/v4me4xqe3i2f1.jpg?width=2268&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1cbb7437b19e21ccb07790754f0e1048acda9486

alright, so there's a bit of a can of worms. let's unpack this calmly:

i've been wanting to get a new saucepan but don't want to buy from amazon. i checked walmart and they didn't have what i needed. now, my plan is to check target (and maybe kohls, which just occurred to me so i just sent an email to myself with that as the subject while i'll be able to address in a minute when i review emails below).

getting a new pot is not urgent but it's convenient to check target if i'm going to kroger bc target is close to kroger.

so let's look at grocery items.

wait, body wash is also something i could get from target but i went ahead and ordered that from amazon yesterday bc i needed to get other things from amazon anyway so that's taken care of.

milk is not urgent. pecans i ordered from amazon. and raisins aren't urgent but i'll probably need to get some the trip after next.

now i know we are creating a bit of spaghetti with this analysis but there's also cleaning my wool blanket and my local cleaners building is gone. i mean literally missing/demolished.

alright that's enough so this is what i'm going to do about all this:

i created a '(remember tomorrow's saturday though) grocery?' alarm for 11am which allows me to decide whether to go in the clarity of the moment, e.g. i might prefer to take a nap if i can since i had poor sleep last night.

BUT, just sneeking up to get chicken (which is from a different place than the other non-urgent grocery items and much closer to home / quicker to get to) might make sense, especially since there will likely be more things i need to get from the grocery by the time the current grocery items become urgent.

i'm going to bring my wool blanket back into the house from my car and postpone getting it cleaned until the winter. and bc my hands are often full when getting back home from errands, i just sent myself a 'get blanket from car' email so i can remember to specifically go out to get the blanket from my car.

* add any¬†**non-urgent**¬†items from planner to whiteboard for execution during hidden idle time¬†*(all tasks other than errands can be broken into 'nothing burgers' \[under 15 minutes\] which can easily fit into already-existing but hidden idle time)*

n/a, but here's my board anyway for your reference and for me to point out something:

https://preview.redd.it/da5vump09i2f1.jpg?width=2900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=699ff51f3b57c735eb236e4b61122a7031ac39b7

actually there are a few things to point out here.

first, you'll notice that i struck through '(w) cln dishwasher' instead of erasing it.

this is to remind me that i need to add it to my planner for one month from now so i'll  do that first before erasing it and have formed a habit of not erasing things unless i'm sure they are not periodic.

same goes for 'presses' (and, in fact, you'll set that i added a dedicated 'and schedule presses in planner') which need to go on my planner for three days from yesterday since i managed to get in a lower body workout yesterday.

and, you'll see that i added 'LOOK' to remind me of alternative activities like hiking bc i keep forgetting to hike.

in fact i'm going to send myself an email now about hiking on weekends...

...ok done and i titled it 'remember to hike on weekends esp JMF (but test knee first)'.

and i'm pleased that i not only remembered treadmill/elliptical alternatives, but also worked those into my lower body workout to help 'walk off' my dinner and also more fully warmup before lifting heavy weight which worked great!

and thus i want to remember this also, so i'm going to send myself an email which will then likely lead to just updating my board with that strategy.

ok last thing. you might think that sending myself emails is silly when i could just get up while i'm writing this and put things directly on my whiteboard and you'd be exactly right.

so, the reason i'm 'absurdly' (which is a strategy for habit formation) sending myself emails is to 'practice' and 'pressure test' my v5.0 task/memory management processes, a part of which is sending myself emails.

actually, i've been wanting to visualize this new process so i'm going to sketch it right now stand by...

* create alarms for any items from planner that¬†**must be done today**

there are no must-do's but i did add 11am alarm to remind me of 'opportunity' to go to the grocery.

* review¬†**text**¬†messages while computer is booting up and, for each item requiring a reply/action, 1) immediately address, 2) create alarm to address today or 3) ~~add to planner to address in future~~ copy/paste into an email to myself to address in future

i received a text re a medical bill, which i copy/pasted into an email to myself.

this reminds me to make the change to #3 above inside v5.0 document itself also bc that is much more elegant than writing in planner...ok done.

i received an email from my ex, who i'm no longer responding to for a number of reasons, bc i want to remember to ask advice from my friends about whether to permanently block her or do i owe her compassion, etc.

...so i copy/pasted that into an email to myself.

the last text was from a great friend who i live vicariously through and i responded immediately to it.

* review¬†**email**¬†messages and, for each item requiring a reply/action, 1) address immediately, 2) create alarm to address today or 3) snooze/punt to a later date

ok, so, not surprisingly given the emails i sent myself above, i have nine unread emails to address:

the 'one re my ex', i'm just going to punt until tomorrow bc i'm not seeing any friends today.

i forwarded the one about the medical bill to my work email.

the one about remembering to hike i'm going to skip bc i would really love to do that tomorrow...oh wait...nevermind bc my daughter's graduation is tomorrow so maybe i can do that after, hmmm..., and maybe my son (who lives near the trail i want to do) and daughter #2 might want to join me, so yeah i'm going to skip this one for now and see if there's room in my weekend to indulge this!

which reminds me, i also want to play pool so tonight would be good for that so i'm going to activate an already-existing non-active alarm bc i'm thinking about making pool part of my evening routine but it hasn't worked out yet during the weekdays.

i'm just going to punt 'get blanket from car' for tomorrow.

same for 'get pot from kohl's?'.

same for a couple of reminders to use restaurant gift cards since i have food i need to use up before it goes bad.

same for 'remember to get eyebrows trimmed' bc that won't happen tonight.

* review alarms to cleanup from yesterday and confirm today's plan

so, other than possibly hitting the grocery, there's nothing today other than [routine everyday things](https://www.reddit.com/r/Non_Medical_ADHD/comments/1kny9ys/my_minimal_thinking_sevendayperweek_routine/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).

* for later recollection of daily activities, create an alarm to log each activity as it is either started or completed

i'm on day 2 of this and loving the results. going to continue testing this.

* for later recollection/forgiveness, log 'universe interventions' / 'unexpected occurrences' in 'universe list'

**Mercedes:** *""Well, Casey seemed pretty convinced that Baddy wanted it back‚Ä¶ but if you say she agreed to sell it, I trust you.""*

*Carmella gives a confident smile, waving her hand dismissively.*

**Carmella:** *""Exactly. Don‚Äôt worry about it, Mercedes. People are always trying to stir the pot, especially when it comes to Havenbrook.""*

**Mercedes:** *""Yeah, I guess so. But it‚Äôd be nice if Baddy just said something directly instead of sending Casey my way.""*

*Carmella chuckles, giving Mercedes a reassuring pat on the hand.*

**Carmella:** *""Trust me, you're in the clear. Just enjoy the ride, alright?""*

*Alexa nods, her expression empathetic as she listens closely.*

**Alexa:** *""It makes sense, Thea. Losing someone you love, even temporarily, can shake your whole foundation. It‚Äôs okay to be scared.""*

**Thea:** *""Yeah, I guess. But now that she‚Äôs back, I feel like I should be happy, but there‚Äôs still this fear‚Ä¶ like, what if something happens again?""*

**Alexa:** *""That‚Äôs understandable. Trauma doesn‚Äôt just go away overnight. It‚Äôs going to take time to heal, for both of you.""*

*Thea looks down at her mug, her eyes glassy.*

**Thea:** *""I just wish I could feel normal again.""*

*Alexa reaches out, placing her hand over Thea‚Äôs.*

*Andreja hesitates, her voice soft.*

**Andreja:** *""I think‚Ä¶ I think I could use that, Alexa. I‚Äôve been feeling lost, and I don‚Äôt know how to fix it.""*

**Casey:** *""Honestly? I just want to help fix things. I know Baddy‚Äôs angry, and Mercedes thinks she did nothing wrong. I feel like I‚Äôm stuck in the middle.""*

**C.C.:** *""That‚Äôs understandable. It‚Äôs a complicated situation. But you‚Äôre doing your best, and that‚Äôs all that matters. We‚Äôll get it figured out.""*

As someone who hosts a lot of dinner parties and summer barbecues, having a reliable ice machine handy is a game-changer. This compact ice-maker is brimming with features, and while I was left impressed overall, a few aspects caught my eye that could use some tweaking.

**EFFICIENT ICE PRODUCTION**  
I didn‚Äôt realize how much I‚Äôd appreciate this little wonder until it churned out a batch of ice in just under seven minutes. It‚Äôs almost like magic! With the ability to produce up to 26 pounds of ice a day, it easily caters to my needs during gatherings or even for my daily iced coffee addiction. The 2.2-liter water tank is decently sized, reducing the frequency of refills, and I‚Äôve found the capacity of holding 1.5 pounds of ice more than adequate for smaller parties.  

[See VIVOHOME VH289-SL deals on Amazon now.](https://fridgefanatic.com/p/b07l3czcmz/)

**CUSTOMIZABLE ICE SIZE OPTIONS**  
One aspect that really stood out to me was the ability to customize the size of the ice cubes. Whether I was using smaller ice cubes for whipping up fancy cocktails or the larger ones for a refreshing lemonade pitcher, the machine adapted perfectly to my needs. Adjusting the size is straightforward thanks to the intelligent LCD control panel. Speaking of the display, I loved being able to monitor the water level and ice production status through the transparent window‚Äîsimple and functional.  

**DURABILITY AND QUIET OPERATION**  
Its construction impressed me right from the unboxing. Made of high-quality ABS material, it feels sturdy yet has a sleek finish that complements my modern kitchen aesthetic. I honestly wouldn‚Äôt have guessed it was an ice maker at a glance; it could nearly pass for some chic gadget! The fact that it's ultra-quiet at about 40 decibels is also something I‚Äôve grown to love. No loud rumbling while hosting, which guests appreciate.

**SELF-CLEANING FUNCTIONALITY**  
Cleaning the machine is often my least favorite part of dealing with any kitchen appliance. However, the self-cleaning function of this ice maker was a pleasant surprise. It's a matter of adding some water, holding down the power button for five seconds, and voil√†‚Äîthe machine gets to work. While I haven‚Äôt used a specialized cleanser for it yet, knowing that‚Äôs only required annually makes maintenance feel less daunting. Even draining the water is straightforward, thanks to the drain plug at the base of the unit.

**LIGHTWEIGHT AND PORTABLE DESIGN**  
At just under 17 pounds, it‚Äôs easy for me to move the machine around. I‚Äôve toted it to the patio for garden parties and even squeezed it into the RV for our annual camping trip‚Äîit fits like a charm! It lives up to its portable promise, performing just as well outdoors as it does in my kitchen. I was skeptical about its adaptability initially, but it proved me wrong in the best way possible.  

**POSITIVES**  
- Elegant design and durable ABS material.  
- Quiet operation at just 40 decibels.  
- Intuitive controls with a see-through display.  
- High ice production capacity for its size.  
- Convenient portability for different settings.  

**LIMITATIONS**  
- The small ice bucket could fill up quickly if left unattended.  
- The unit, while compact, requires open counter space for ventilation.  
- Limited options for advanced customizations beyond ice size.

**COMPETITIVE OPTIONS**  
In the realm of portable ice makers, there‚Äôs certainly no shortage of competitors. I had briefly considered getting products like the Igloo ICEB26HN, which comes with an automatic self-dispensing system but lacks the lightweight portability. Another rival option, the GE Profile Opal Nugget Ice Maker, is famous for its nugget ice production and stylish design. However, it's considerably heavier and more expensive, not to mention the maintenance process isn‚Äôt nearly as simple as the VIVOHOME option. For anyone looking for a functional and versatile daily solution without splurging unnecessarily, VIVOHOME‚Äôs compact ice maker finds the sweet spot.

**AFFORDABLE QUALITY**  
While I don‚Äôt want to name specific figures, the price of this machine falls comfortably within the range I‚Äôd expect for similar models. Considering its durability, features, and portability, I‚Äôd say you‚Äôre getting a lot of bang for your buck. It‚Äôs not the most technical or advanced ice machine on the market, but it more than gets the job done. To me, that‚Äôs worth every penny, especially if you‚Äôre someone who hosts regularly or just enjoys ice cubes readily available without fully committing to larger appliances.

*Alinity shrugs, her eyes tearing up.*

**Alinity:** *""Afraid of what? Of actually loving someone? I don't know‚Ä¶ I thought she cared about me, but I can‚Äôt keep waiting around for her to figure out what she wants.""*

*Jenna nods, accepting the coffee as Ivy hands it over.*

**Jenna:** *""That‚Äôs good. She‚Äôs been through a lot‚Ä¶ How about you? How‚Äôre you holding up?""*

*Jazzy, sitting on the couch, watches Baddy‚Äôs anger swell.*

**Jazzy:** *""Baddy, please, let‚Äôs take a breath. Fighting them won‚Äôt solve anything. We‚Äôll find the car, we‚Äôll get it back. We just need to be smart about it.""*

**Baddy:** *""I know, but I can‚Äôt just sit here doing nothing. They‚Äôre playing with my pride, Jazzy. My history.""*

1ktgwlz,https://youtu.be/Z8WLDe2XEt8,3 Very Scary TRUE Texas Heatwave Horror Stories,"**""No Air, No Water, No Mercy"":**

I woke up drenched in sweat on June 15, 2023, in our small, single-story house in Freeport, Texas. My t-shirt stuck to my skin, heavy and damp, as if I‚Äôd been dunked in a tub. The air inside was thick, pressing against my chest like a weight. Across the room, Mom lay in her hospital bed, her thin frame barely moving under the sheet. Her breathing was shallow, her face pale and slick with sweat. She‚Äôd been bedridden since her stroke last year, and without the air conditioner, the room felt like a trap closing in. It broke three days ago, on June 12, and when I called the repair company, the guy‚Äôs voice was flat, exhausted. ‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, it‚Äôll be at least a week. Every unit in town‚Äôs down, and we‚Äôre swamped.‚Äù I hung up, staring at the phone, wondering how we‚Äôd survive that long.I grabbed an old magazine from the coffee table, its pages curling, and fanned Mom‚Äôs face. Her eyes fluttered open, glassy and unfocused. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm thirsty,‚Äù she whispered, her voice so weak it barely reached me. I hurried to the kitchen, my socks sticking to the linoleum floor, and grabbed our last bottle of water from the fridge. It was warm, useless against the heat, but I held it to her lips, tilting it carefully. She sipped, wincing, and I rationed it, knowing we had nothing else. The news on the battery-powered radio crackled with stories of people collapsing, hospitals overflowing, and fights breaking out over water and ice. I checked the locks on the front door, the deadbolt cold against my fingers, and tried to push the fear down.Yesterday, June 14, I‚Äôd walked two miles to the corner store on Velasco Street, my sneakers sinking into the softening asphalt. The sun was relentless, and by the time I got there, my head throbbed, my vision blurring at the edges. Inside, the store was chaos‚Äîshelves stripped bare, people shoving each other for the last bags of ice. A woman in a red tank top screamed at the cashier, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre hiding water in the back, I know it!‚Äù The cashier, a young guy with sweat beading on his forehead, just shook his head. I stood in line for an hour, clutching my last ten dollars, but left with nothing. On the walk home, I felt dizzy, my mouth dry as sand. A man sitting on a curb, his face burned red, muttered to himself, clutching an empty water jug. I hurried past, my heart racing.When I got back, Mrs. Garcia, our neighbor from two houses down, was waiting on the porch. Her gray hair was pulled back, her face etched with worry. ‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù she asked, pressing a small jug of water into my hands. It was half-full, warm, but I nearly cried. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not much, but take it,‚Äù she said. Her eyes darted to the street, where a pickup truck idled, its driver staring too long. ‚ÄúBe careful,‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúSome folks are getting desperate. I heard about a break-in on Brazosport Boulevard last night.‚Äù I thanked her, clutching the jug, and locked the door behind me.Today, June 15, the power flickered again, cutting off the small desk fan I‚Äôd rigged up on Mom‚Äôs nightstand. She groaned, her hand twitching toward me. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too hot,‚Äù she mumbled, her voice cracking. I soaked a dish towel in tap water‚Äîwarm and stale‚Äîand draped it over her forehead. It barely helped. Her skin felt clammy, and I noticed her lips were chapped, starting to crack. My phone was dead, the charger useless without power. The car, an old sedan parked in the driveway, wouldn‚Äôt start either; the battery had died on June 13, and the mechanic said parts were backordered. We were trapped, no way to get help.Around noon, a loud knock jolted me. I crept to the living room window, peeling back the curtain just enough to see. Mr. Johnson, the older man from three houses down, stood on the porch. His flannel shirt was stained dark with sweat, his gray hair matted. He‚Äôd always been quiet, mowing his lawn every Sunday, but now he looked different‚Äîeyes wild, swaying like he might collapse. ‚ÄúYou got water?‚Äù he called, his voice rough, almost pleading. I hesitated, my hand on the deadbolt. ‚ÄúNot much,‚Äù I said through the door, keeping the chain on. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre rationing for Mom.‚Äù‚ÄúYou have to share,‚Äù he said, louder, his fist clenching at his side. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not right, keeping it all!‚Äù I glanced at Mom, her chest rising and falling too fast, her eyes half-open. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù I said, my voice shaking. ‚ÄúWe barely have enough for her.‚Äù He slammed his fist against the door, the wood rattling in the frame. I jumped, my heart pounding. ‚ÄúOpen up!‚Äù he shouted, banging again, each hit louder than the last. I backed away, grabbing a kitchen knife from the counter, its handle slick in my sweaty palm. ‚ÄúPlease, go away,‚Äù I called, but he kept pounding, the sound drilling into my head.I whispered to Mom, ‚ÄúStay quiet.‚Äù Her eyes were wide, scared, her fingers clutching the sheet. The banging stopped, and I held my breath, hoping he‚Äôd left. Then I heard a crash‚Äîglass shattering in the kitchen. My stomach lurched. I crept down the hall, knife raised, my pulse thumping in my ears. Mr. Johnson was halfway through the kitchen window, shards of glass glittering on the floor. His face was red, sweat dripping into his eyes, which looked wrong, like he wasn‚Äôt fully there. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt hide it!‚Äù he yelled, his voice cracking as he pulled himself through, cutting his hand on the jagged frame. Blood smeared on the counter.‚ÄúGet out!‚Äù I screamed, holding the knife higher, my hands trembling so hard I thought I‚Äôd drop it. He froze, staring at me, his chest heaving. ‚ÄúYou have water,‚Äù he said, almost a growl. ‚ÄúI saw that woman give you some!‚Äù I shook my head, stepping back, my sneakers crunching on glass. ‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù I said, softer, ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt have enough. Mom‚Äôs sick.‚Äù He took a step closer, his boots heavy on the floor, and I tightened my grip, my heart racing so fast I felt faint. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to hurt you,‚Äù I said, but my voice broke, barely a whisper.He lunged, grabbing for the knife. I swung without thinking, the blade slicing his arm. He yelled, stumbling back, blood dripping onto the linoleum. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre crazy!‚Äù he shouted, clutching his arm, his face twisted in pain. He scrambled back through the window, cursing as he ran, leaving a trail of blood. I dropped the knife, my knees buckling, and shoved the kitchen table against the broken window, knowing it wouldn‚Äôt hold if he came back. My hands shook as I swept the glass into a pile, my mind racing. What if he brought others? The radio had mentioned break-ins, people targeting houses with old folks, the vulnerable.I ran to Mom, who was crying softly, her voice barely audible. ‚ÄúIs he gone?‚Äù she asked. I nodded, wiping her face with the damp towel. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay,‚Äù I lied, my throat tight. I could hear sirens far off, probably heading to another call. The news said hospitals were full, police stretched thin. I thought of Mrs. Garcia‚Äôs warning about break-ins and felt sick. I dragged a bookshelf in front of the front door, my arms aching, and checked the back door, locking it tight. I sat by Mom, holding her hand, watching her breathe too fast, her skin still clammy.Hours dragged by, maybe longer‚ÄîI lost track. My throat was so dry it hurt to swallow, and my head felt heavy, like I might pass out. I gave Mom the last sips of Mrs. Garcia‚Äôs water, saving none for myself. Her breathing slowed a little, but she still looked weak, her lips pale. I kept the knife on the nightstand, my eyes darting to the windows every few minutes, listening for footsteps. The street was quiet, but it felt wrong, like the calm before something worse.Around 8 p.m., the power hummed back on. I gasped, almost laughing, as the desk fan whirred to life. I plugged in the small portable AC unit Mrs. Garcia had lent us, its motor rattling but pushing out a trickle of cool air. I moved it close to Mom, and her face relaxed, her breathing easing. I sat on the floor, my back against her bed, and let the air brush my skin, though it wasn‚Äôt enough to stop the sweat. The radio crackled with updates: more deaths, more fights, people arrested for stealing water and food. I thought of Mr. Johnson, wondering if he‚Äôd come back, if he‚Äôd told others we had water.I looked out the window, the street dark except for a flickering streetlight. No sign of Mr. Johnson, but I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling of being watched. I held Mom‚Äôs hand, her fingers cold despite the heat, and whispered, ‚ÄúWe made it.‚Äù But I didn‚Äôt believe it. The radio said more heat was coming, no end in sight. I kept the knife close, checking the locks again, and stayed awake all night, listening for any sound‚Äîfootsteps, glass breaking, anything. The fear didn‚Äôt leave, even with the power back. I knew we weren‚Äôt safe, not really, not while the heat kept pushing people to the edge.





**‚ÄúThe Knock on the Door‚Äù:**

I woke up on July 12, 2024, in my small house in Houston, Texas, drenched in sweat, the air so thick it felt like breathing soup. The power had been out for three days, ever since Hurricane Beryl tore through, leaving the city a mess of downed lines and broken hopes. No hum of the air conditioner, no flicker of lights‚Äîjust a heavy, suffocating silence. My bedroom felt like a sauna, the walls warm to the touch. I dragged myself out of bed, my bare feet sticking to the hardwood floor, and stumbled to the bathroom. The mirror showed my face flushed, eyes heavy with exhaustion. My head was already throbbing, a dull ache that wouldn‚Äôt quit.I splashed warm water on my face‚Äîit was all I had, with the ice in the freezer long gone, melted into useless puddles. In the kitchen, I grabbed a glass from the cupboard and filled it from a jug I‚Äôd stored before the storm. The water tasted flat, almost metallic, but I forced it down. I‚Äôd heard on the radio, before it all went dark, that this heatwave was a killer‚Äîhundreds dead across Texas, some from heatstroke, others from desperation gone wrong. Beryl had left nearly three million of us without power, and with no way to cool off, people were losing it.I wet a dish towel and draped it over my neck, hoping for some relief, but it dried in minutes. The house was a trap, closing in on me. I was alone, no family nearby, no neighbors I knew well. My phone was dead, the cell towers down, and the silence made every creak of the house feel louder. I moved to the living room, where the windows let in a faint breeze, but it wasn‚Äôt enough. My shirt clung to my back, and every breath felt like sucking air through a straw. I sat on the couch, trying to stay still, but my mind raced. What if the power didn‚Äôt come back? What if my water ran out? I had a few jugs left, but not enough for days.By noon, the heat was unbearable, pressing into me like a weight. My head pounded harder, and my mouth stayed dry no matter how much I sipped. I knew the signs‚Äîheat exhaustion, maybe worse. I‚Äôd read about it on my phone before it died: dizziness, nausea, confusion. People died from this, especially in Houston, where summers could kill as surely as any storm. I tried to focus on something else, grabbing a book, but the words blurred on the page. My vision wavered, and I felt a wave of nausea roll through me. I pressed the towel to my face again, but it was no use.Then I heard it‚Äîa soft thump on the porch. I froze, my heart jumping. It could‚Äôve been a branch, but there was no wind, no sound but the endless drone of cicadas outside. The thump came again, louder, deliberate. Someone was out there.I crept to the window, my legs shaky, and peeked through the blinds. A man stood on my porch, his clothes dirty and torn, his face red and blistered from the sun. He held a plastic jug of water, gripping it like it was gold. His eyes darted around, nervous, maybe scared. He knocked, hard, the sound echoing through the house. ‚ÄúHey! Anyone home? I need help! Please!‚ÄùMy stomach twisted. I didn‚Äôt know him. The news had been full of stories before the power went out‚Äîlooters hitting houses, fights breaking out over bottled water. But he looked rough, like he‚Äôd been out in the heat too long. His lips were cracked, his hands trembling. Could I leave him out there to collapse? I wanted to help, but every instinct screamed to keep the door shut.I edged to the door and opened it a crack, the chain still on. ‚ÄúWhat do you need?‚Äù I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.He leaned closer, his breath hot through the gap. ‚ÄúWater. I‚Äôve got some to trade. Please, let me in, just for a minute. I can‚Äôt stay out here.‚ÄùI hesitated, my hand on the chain. He didn‚Äôt look dangerous, but something about his eyes‚Äîtoo sharp, too focused‚Äîmade my skin crawl. Still, I couldn‚Äôt shake the guilt. What if he died out there, and it was on me? ‚ÄúLeave your bag outside,‚Äù I said finally. ‚ÄúAnd don‚Äôt try anything.‚ÄùHe nodded fast, dropping a worn backpack on the porch, and I unhooked the chain. He stepped inside, bringing a wave of sour sweat and dust with him. He was taller than I‚Äôd thought, broad-shouldered, his arms muscled despite his ragged state. His eyes scanned the room‚Äîmy couch, the water jugs on the counter, the closed blinds. I pointed to the kitchen. ‚ÄúWater‚Äôs in there. Take what you need and go.‚ÄùHe shuffled off, his boots scuffing the floor. I heard the faucet run, then silence. My heart was still racing, and I stood by the door, ready to bolt it the second he left. When he came back, he held a glass, sipping slowly. ‚ÄúNice place,‚Äù he said, his voice rough. ‚ÄúYou got it good here. All alone?‚ÄùI stiffened, my fingers tightening on the doorframe. ‚ÄúJust me. You got your water. Time to go.‚ÄùHe set the glass on the coffee table, deliberate, like he was stalling. ‚ÄúYou hear about the looting? Down on Cypress Street, they cleaned out a whole house. Food, water, everything. People are getting desperate.‚ÄùMy throat went dry. Cypress was two blocks away. ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt hear that.‚ÄùHe stepped closer, his boots heavy on the floor. ‚ÄúYeah. It‚Äôs bad out there. You gotta be careful, locking yourself in like this. Someone could just‚Ä¶ walk in.‚Äù‚ÄúI‚Äôm careful,‚Äù I said, backing toward the couch. ‚ÄúYou need to leave. Now.‚ÄùHe smiled, but it wasn‚Äôt kind. It was sharp, like he knew something I didn‚Äôt. ‚ÄúRelax. I‚Äôm just talking. No need to get jumpy.‚Äù‚ÄúNo, you‚Äôre not. Get out.‚Äù My voice shook, but I held his gaze.He sighed, like I was being difficult, and turned for the door. ‚ÄúFine. But watch yourself. This heat‚Äîit makes people do things.‚Äù He grabbed his bag and stepped outside, the door clicking shut behind him.I locked it fast, my hands trembling so bad I almost dropped the key. Something about him felt wrong, like he‚Äôd been testing me, sizing up the house. I checked every window, every lock, my pulse pounding in my ears. The heat was making me paranoid, or maybe it was just him.The day dragged on, each hour heavier than the last. By evening, I was on the floor, my back against the wall, too weak to stand. My head felt like it was splitting, and my vision kept blurring. I‚Äôd sipped water all day, but it wasn‚Äôt enough. My body was shutting down, and I knew it. I‚Äôd read about heatstroke‚Äîhow it sneaks up, how it kills. I tried to stand, but my legs wobbled, and I sank back down, gasping.Then I heard it‚Äîa soft tap on the back door. My blood froze. It came again, louder, more insistent. I crawled to the door, my hands shaking as I peered through the peephole. It was him, that same man, his face twisted in a grin, his eyes glinting in the fading light of dusk.‚ÄúOpen up!‚Äù he called, his voice sharp. ‚ÄúI forgot something! Come on, don‚Äôt make me stand out here!‚ÄùI didn‚Äôt move, didn‚Äôt breathe. Maybe he‚Äôd think I wasn‚Äôt home. But he banged again, the door rattling in its frame. ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre in there! Open the door!‚ÄùMy heart pounded so hard it hurt. I backed away, my mind racing. Had I locked the back door? I‚Äôd checked it that morning, but now I wasn‚Äôt sure. Everything was a blur, the heat clouding my thoughts.Then I heard footsteps, heavy and deliberate, moving around the house. He was circling, looking for a way in. I stumbled to the kitchen, grabbing a butcher knife from the counter. It felt heavy in my hand, but it was all I had. I crouched by the back door, listening as the footsteps stopped. Silence. Then a shadow moved past the window, his face pressing against the glass, his hands cupped around his eyes.‚ÄúHey!‚Äù he shouted, his voice muffled but sharp. ‚ÄúI see you! Just open the door!‚ÄùI gripped the knife, my hands slick with sweat. The heat was pulling me under, my vision swimming, but I couldn‚Äôt give in. Not now. The door shook as he slammed against it, the lock creaking. ‚ÄúCome on!‚Äù he yelled. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be stupid!‚ÄùI wanted to scream, to tell him to leave, but my throat was too dry. The door shook again, harder, and I heard wood splinter. He was going to get in. I scrambled to the closet, my hands shaking as I dug through boxes. I‚Äôd remembered an old baseball bat, a relic from my brother‚Äôs high school days. I found it, gripping it tight, and ran back to the door just as it burst open.He stood there, his grin wide, his eyes wild with something I didn‚Äôt want to name. ‚ÄúTold you I‚Äôd be back,‚Äù he said, stepping inside, his boots loud on the floor.I swung the bat, hard, but he dodged, laughing like it was a game. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre gonna regret that,‚Äù he said, lunging toward me.I swung again, but he grabbed the bat, yanking it from my hands. It clattered to the floor, and I stumbled back, hitting the wall. My legs were giving out, the heat and fear dragging me down. He stepped closer, his shadow looming over me.‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt have let me in before,‚Äù he said, his voice low, almost a growl. ‚ÄúBig mistake.‚ÄùMy vision blurred, the room tilting. I was going to pass out, and he‚Äôd do whatever he wanted. But then, a shout from outside cut through the fog. ‚ÄúHey! What‚Äôs going on in there?‚ÄùIt was a voice I didn‚Äôt know, but it was real. The man froze, his head snapping toward the sound. Footsteps crunched outside, closer now. ‚ÄúI said, what‚Äôs happening?‚Äù the voice called again, sharp and urgent.The man cursed under his breath and bolted, shoving past the door and disappearing into the dark. I slid to the floor, gasping, as a figure appeared in the doorway‚Äîan older man, gray hair, wearing a faded Astros cap. My neighbor from down the street, one I‚Äôd only waved to before. ‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù he asked, kneeling beside me. ‚ÄúI saw that guy skulking around earlier. Called the cops when I heard the noise.‚ÄùI nodded, too weak to speak. My head was spinning, my body heavy. He grabbed a water jug from the counter and poured some into a cup, holding it to my lips. ‚ÄúDrink slow,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre in bad shape.‚ÄùSirens wailed in the distance, getting louder. The neighbor stayed with me, talking softly, keeping me awake until the paramedics arrived. They said it was heatstroke, said I was lucky to be alive. They took me to a hospital, where the air was cool and the lights were bright.But even now, lying in that sterile bed, I can‚Äôt stop seeing his face‚Äîthat grin, those eyes. He‚Äôs still out there, somewhere in Houston, waiting for another house, another chance. And in this heat, with the city falling apart, I know he‚Äôs not the only one.





**""Three Days Without Air"":**

It was July 2023, and I was stuck in my small house in Laredo, Texas, three days into a brutal heatwave that had the whole town in a chokehold. The power grid had failed, leaving my neighborhood dark and silent. My old window-unit air conditioner sputtered and died on the first day, and now the air inside was thick, heavy, almost impossible to breathe. Sweat soaked through my cotton shirt, dripping down my back and stinging my eyes. The thermometer on the kitchen wall was stuck at 104 degrees, but it felt hotter, like the house was cooking me alive.My golden retriever, Max, lay sprawled on the chipped linoleum floor in the living room, his tongue lolling out, panting so hard I could see his ribs shudder with every breath. His water bowl was bone dry, the last drops gone hours ago. I‚Äôd tried soaking a towel to cool him down, but it dried out faster than I could wet it again. His eyes were glassy, half-closed, and he hadn‚Äôt touched his food in two days. My head throbbed, a dull ache that pulsed with every heartbeat, and my mouth felt like sandpaper. We were running out of time.My phone was dead, its battery drained yesterday after a final text from my daughter. She was stuck at her job in San Antonio, an hour away, because the heat had shut down half the city. ‚ÄúMom, stay safe, I‚Äôll call soon,‚Äù she‚Äôd written. That was July 10th. Now, on July 12th, I had no way to reach her, no way to know if she was okay. The radio had stopped working too, but not before I heard reports of people collapsing in their homes, some not making it. The heat was a predator, and it was hunting us all.I looked at Max, his whimpers barely audible over his heavy panting. I couldn‚Äôt let him die here. The veterinary clinic on Main Street was just under a mile away. If they had a generator, they might have air conditioning, maybe even a working phone. It was our only shot. I grabbed my wide-brimmed hat, a plastic bottle of warm water‚Äîthe last one in the house‚Äîand clipped Max‚Äôs leash to his collar. ‚ÄúCome on, boy,‚Äù I said, trying to sound strong. He struggled to his feet, legs wobbling, his tail giving a weak wag before drooping.Stepping outside was like walking into an oven. The street was deserted, no kids on bikes, no neighbors chatting, just an eerie stillness. The asphalt shimmered, sticky under my sneakers, and the air burned my lungs. I took a few steps and felt a wave of dizziness hit me, my vision blurring at the edges. I grabbed a rusty mailbox for balance, my heart racing. Max slumped beside me, his tongue scraping the ground as he panted. I poured a little water into my palm, but he barely licked it, his head drooping lower. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre gonna make it,‚Äù I whispered, more to myself than to him.We shuffled down the street, passing rows of quiet houses with drawn curtains. The silence was unnerving, broken only by Max‚Äôs labored breathing and the faint buzz of cicadas. My legs felt heavy, like I was wading through molasses. About halfway to the clinic, I saw Mrs. Carter‚Äôs house, a faded blue bungalow with a sagging porch. Her old Buick was parked crooked in the driveway, and her front door was ajar, the screen door flapping in the slight breeze. Something felt wrong, like the air itself was holding its breath.‚ÄúMrs. Carter?‚Äù I called, my voice shaky. No answer. I hesitated, then stepped onto her porch, Max dragging behind me. The boards creaked under my weight, and I saw her‚Äîslumped in her rocking chair, a shattered coffee mug at her feet. Her head was tilted back, mouth slightly open, and her skin was a sickly gray, like old wax. Her eyes stared blankly at the porch ceiling. My stomach lurched. I reached out, my hand trembling, and touched her wrist. It was cold, stiff. She was gone.‚ÄúMrs. Carter‚Ä¶‚Äù I whispered, stepping back. My chest tightened, panic clawing at me. The heat had taken her, just like that. I thought of the news reports‚Äîpeople found in their homes, no air conditioning, no way out. It could be me next. It could be Max. I tugged his leash, my hands shaking. ‚ÄúWe gotta go, boy.‚Äù He whined, struggling to stand, and we stumbled off the porch.The street seemed to stretch forever now. My head spun, and the heat played tricks on my eyes. For a moment, I saw my daughter standing at the corner, her long braid swaying as she waved. ‚ÄúMom, you okay?‚Äù her voice called, faint and distorted. I blinked, and she vanished, just a mirage shimmering on the pavement. My throat closed up, tears mixing with the sweat on my face. I couldn‚Äôt tell what was real anymore.Max was slowing down, his paws scraping the ground, his body swaying. I poured the last of the water over his back, watching it steam off almost instantly. My own steps faltered, my chest tight, my vision narrowing to a tunnel. What if the clinic was closed? What if they had no power either? The thought gnawed at me, but I pushed it away. We had to keep going.Then I heard it‚Äîa low, guttural sound behind me, like a growl. I froze, spinning around, but the street was empty. Just the heat, messing with my head again. Or was it? My pulse hammered in my ears. I tightened my grip on Max‚Äôs leash and moved faster, ignoring the ache in my legs. ‚ÄúAlmost there,‚Äù I muttered, my voice barely audible.Finally, the clinic‚Äôs sign appeared, faded red letters spelling out ‚ÄúLaredo Animal Care.‚Äù The door was open, and I heard the faint hum of a generator. Relief hit me like a wave, but my legs were giving out. Max collapsed as we crossed the threshold, his body thudding against the tile floor. I dropped to my knees beside him, my vision swimming.The receptionist, a young woman with a messy bun, gasped. ‚ÄúOh my gosh, are you okay? What happened?‚Äù Her voice was sharp with concern.‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I croaked, my throat dry as dust. ‚ÄúMy dog‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs dying. And my neighbor, Mrs. Carter‚Äîshe‚Äôs dead on her porch. Please, help us.‚ÄùHer eyes widened, and she jumped up, yelling, ‚ÄúDr. Lee, emergency in here!‚Äù She grabbed a phone and dialed 911. ‚ÄúYes, we need an ambulance at 214 Oak Street. An elderly woman, deceased. And we‚Äôve got a heat emergency here at the clinic.‚ÄùDr. Lee, a short woman with tired eyes and a stethoscope around her neck, rushed over. She knelt beside Max, checking his gums and eyes. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs severely dehydrated,‚Äù she said, her voice calm but urgent. ‚ÄúHeat exhaustion, maybe heatstroke. We‚Äôll start fluids immediately.‚Äù She looked at me, her brow furrowed. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not in great shape either. Sit down, drink this.‚Äù She handed me a plastic cup of ice water, the cold shocking my hands.I sank into a chair, the room spinning. The water burned my throat as I drank, but it was the best thing I‚Äôd ever tasted. ‚ÄúIs Max gonna be okay?‚Äù I asked, my voice trembling as I watched them lift him onto a table and hook up an IV.‚ÄúHe‚Äôs got a fighting chance,‚Äù Dr. Lee said, adjusting the drip. ‚ÄúYou got him here just in time. The heat‚Äôs been relentless‚Äîwe‚Äôve had five dogs and two cats come in today, all like this. People too, collapsing at home.‚ÄùI nodded, my hands clutching the cup. ‚ÄúMrs. Carter‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt know she was gone until I saw her. She was just sitting there, like she was asleep.‚ÄùThe receptionist, now back at her desk, looked over with sympathy. ‚ÄúYou did the right thing, coming here. The ambulance is on its way to her place. They‚Äôll take care of her.‚ÄùI stared at Max, his chest rising and falling more steadily now. The clinic‚Äôs air was cool, a miracle after the suffocating heat outside. But my mind kept flashing back to Mrs. Carter‚Äôs lifeless face, the empty street, the growl I thought I heard. The heat had twisted my senses, made me see my daughter, hear things that weren‚Äôt there. It was still out there, waiting for its next chance.‚ÄúHow long‚Äôs the power been out in your area?‚Äù the receptionist asked, breaking my thoughts.‚ÄúThree days,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúNo air conditioning, no fans. I thought we could tough it out, but‚Ä¶‚Äù My voice trailed off.She shook her head. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs bad all over Laredo. They‚Äôre saying the grid might not be back for another day or two. People are crowding cooling centers, but they‚Äôre full.‚ÄùDr. Lee chimed in, wiping her hands on a towel. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lucky you made it here. We‚Äôve got a generator, but even that‚Äôs struggling to keep up. If you‚Äôd stayed home much longer, it could‚Äôve been worse‚Äîfor both of you.‚ÄùI shivered, despite the cool air. Worse. Like Mrs. Carter. I thought of her alone in that chair, no one to check on her, no one to notice until it was too late. I looked at Max, his eyes a little brighter now, and felt tears prick my eyes. We‚Äôd made it, but barely.The receptionist handed me another cup of water. ‚ÄúStay as long as you need,‚Äù she said softly. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll keep an eye on your dog.‚ÄùI nodded, my throat too tight to speak. The hum of the generator filled the room, a steady reminder of how fragile our safety was. Outside, the heatwave raged on, claiming lives, breaking minds. I‚Äôd escaped it for now, but the fear lingered, heavy as the air I‚Äôd left behind. I held Max‚Äôs leash tightly, like it was the only thing keeping me anchored.",1,1747998833.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

*Location: The quiet streets of Havenbrook, just before dawn. A dark figure moves stealthily through the back alleys, face obscured by shadow. The bakery is still, unaware of the danger looming just outside.*

**Narrator (internal monologue):**  
*‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt Thea. No, Thea was never the target. The fire was meant for something else, someone else. It was Rhea‚Äôs attention that I wanted‚Ä¶ and she will come. I know she will.‚Äù*

*The figure pulls out a match, striking it with deliberate care. The small flame dances in the night, casting an eerie glow over the shadowed face. With a flick of the wrist, the match is tossed into a pile of kindling placed at the back of the bakery.*

**Narrator (continuing):**  
*‚ÄúShe will come, but will she realize why? Or will this town remain blind to the truth?‚Äù*

No one is. It‚Äôs already too late, and the darkness is watching. If you keep searching, you‚Äôll find something worse than fire.‚Äù*

# Note 2:

Hey onebaggers!

I‚Äôm gearing up for a minimalist adventure with a bit of a twist: 5 days on the **Alta Via 1** in Italy‚Äôs Aosta Valley... a stunning alpine route also known as the *High Route of the Giants*. Think mountain passes, glaciers in the distance, and lots of vertical gain.

I won‚Äôt be doing the full trail, just a section from **Gressoney-Saint-Jean** to **Nus**. It‚Äôs a semi-self-supported trek, so I‚Äôll be carrying a **tent, food, and water**, but I‚Äôm not going full wild, there are mountain huts along the way where I might grab a hot meal or coffee now and then.

Trying to keep things light:  
**Current base weight (no food/water): 5.25 kg (11.6 lbs)**  
Photo attached shows my gear layout (not pictured: clothes I‚Äôll be wearing). Full item list is in the post.

Would love feedback from the onebag brain trust:

* Anything clearly *missing* for this kind of trip?
* Anything *overkill* that you'd ditch to stay lean?

I know this is a bit more ‚Äútrail‚Äù than most trips here, but I‚Äôve found a ton of value in this community‚Äôs minimalist mindset... so I figured it was worth sharing.

You know the one where you decide to meet your charming online match in a bustling cafe, thinking it‚Äôll help ease the tension. Spoiler: it totally didn't. 

We'd been chatting online for a few weeks, and things seemed super chill. I was thinking, 'Yeah, this is going well... we should meet IRL.' He suggested a popular cafe in town, and I'm like, why not? Turns out, suggesting a crowded spot might be both a good and bad idea.

Anyway, I get there early‚Äîlike right on time‚Äîbecause waiting around is nerve-wracking, tbh. As soon as he walked in, I knew it was him. Not because I recognized him immediately but because, well, he was doing that awkward 'is-that-her?' dance we all seem to perfect at some point. We locked eyes, gave each other a nervous wave, and then... the real trial began. 

Conversation in a coffee shop is supposed to be this natural thing, right? But nah, it was like being at the world's loudest party where you're trying to yell over the music just to discuss your favorite TV shows or, idk, the weather.

If I could put emojis in real life, I'd definitely have done the facepalm one. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

A few days later, the United Planets soldiers stood together in a cemetery on the jungle planet. They stood victorious, but after paying a mighty cost. They gazed at the graves of legions of their comrades teary-eyed.

Orion walked before the crowd of his soldiers his steps slow but deliberate.

""We come here today to bid farewell to our comrades. This war has cost us all lovers, family, and friends. But we must not let these hardships break us.‚Äù

Orion glanced over to Damara standing in the front of the crowd with Sarah and Lucas, wiping tears from her eyes.

‚ÄúWounds to the mind and spirit are just as devastating as those to the body. Despair is one of the many weapons our enemy wields against us. But it only has as much power as we give it.‚Äù

The soldiers gave Orion applause, clapping.

‚ÄúLet us go forth and make E-. Let us go forth and make all those we have lost proud by fighting with honor and integrity.‚Äù

Again, the soldiers gave Orion applause, clapping but louder.

‚ÄúFor our loved ones, we must soldier on to the dream. A peaceful and free galaxy.""¬†

The soldiers clapped once more at Orion's speech but even louder than before as he turned his back to them, staring at Everton‚Äôs grave, his dearest friend.

\*\*\*

Later, Daisy walked alone with Orion, Sarah, and Lucas.

""Your speech was beautiful, Orion. But still, Everton is gone,"" Daisy said, sorrowfully.

""He will outlive us all, Daisy. For his sacrifice has ensured the longevity of freedom.""

""I hate to leave things like this, but I want to go home now. I want to find my loved ones, hug them, and never let go. Especially now, Carter must be returning from the siege on darkhold.""

Orion shook as he heard Daisy. ""Is there a darkhold fortress on Earth?""

""Yes, why?""

""You humans wouldn't know this, but a darkhold fortress is a nearly indestructible doomsday device. If it becomes fully functional, that entire part of space will belong to Mavor.""

*""Carter,‚Äù*¬†Daisy said, terrified.

Daisy ran off to get home at top speed, but as Sarah saw her, she sprinted over to Orion.

""Oh, my gods. Boss, if this is true, we should back her up.""

""Sarah, we're in no shape for another battle. The generals are still busy. And we haven't fully treated our mental and physical wounds, "" Lucas said.

The group quickly noticed that Daisy had stopped running as light surrounded her. It flew off her body, taking the form of a noble stallion before her. The stallion had pure white fur, large bird-like wings, and a mane that quickly became red flames.

""I-I can hear your voice in my head. You're here to help me,"" Daisy said.

Daisy swiftly spotted a mount on the stallion and jumped onto him. The stallion flew Daisy up, carrying her away from the planet. But as she pulled on his reigns, she stopped him and waved goodbye to Orion, Lucas, and Sarah. And they reciprocated as she left.

""Farewell, Damara, and safe travels,"" Orion said.

In space, Daisy flew from the planet. However, she stopped, looking back at it teary-eyed.""Goodbye, Everton."" Forcibly turning her gaze away, she continued her journey, leaving a trail of tears.

\*\*\*

A red streak raced through the galaxy, cutting across the stars with nearly unparalleled urgency. Daisy traveled at light speed on the back of the stallion, approaching her world as a hardened warrior.

The Grand Army of Earth and the Nemesis continued their brutal conflict. But the massive Nemesis battleships bombarded the humans, guarding the construction of the darkhold fortress. Morana watched the human soldiers from the control center with a smile. The ships in her fleet rained heavy plasma bombardment on the humans, tearing their forces apart.

Daisy swiftly flew into the sky over the war zone, seeing the carnage. She grew her shield to a giant size and tossed it at one of the Nemesis ships, a vessel eight hundred and sixty-three feet long, cleaving it in two. Daisy guided her shield through the air, cutting through the rest of the Nemesis fleet like paper, and the sky was a blaze from their destruction like a sun went supernova.

Morana watched the destruction of her army in disbelief. But as she spotted Daisy on the security screen, it turned to a searing scowl.

*‚ÄúWho the chaos is that?‚Äù*¬†Morana shouted.

Outside, Daisy quickly landed, forcing the Nemesis infantry to retreat. But as she approached the humans, they brandished their weapons for trouble.

""Please, don't be afraid. My name is Damara, and I'm here to help.""

""And why should we believe that?""

As Daisy heard a familiar voice, her heart skipped a beat as her eyes confirmed her beloved Carter.

*""Carter. You don't recognize me either, do you?""*¬†Daisy thought.

""Well, answer the question, you freakish dame. You may be an enemy of the Nemesis, but that doesn't guarantee you're a friend of ours.""

""I am a friend. And I know about you, C-captain Barnes.""

""How exactly?""

""T-that doesn't matter right now. What does is you're a good man. One that would make sure every soldier in your command got home safe. So I beg you to let me help.""

Carter looked around at his soldiers, seeing them bloody, bruised, and missing limbs. And he let off a sigh and groan. ""I'm going to regret this."" Signaling his acceptance of Damara‚Äôs offer.

""No, you won't. I swear on my life.""

Carter drew his sword, placing it inches away from decapitating Daisy, inches from ending his beloved‚Äôs life without knowing it, faster than she could perceive. He looked at her with a cold, dead gaze.""Remember your words."" Finally, removing his sword from her neck.¬†

""Okay, Damara, let's talk Strategy.""

Later, in the control center, there was chaos. The Nemesis ran frantically, trying to complete their jobs with Morana's cold, ruthless gaze as motivation.

""I want this fortress at full power now. The emperor believes this part of space will make a valuable, strategic asset. Make me fail him at your peril."" Morana spat.

A soldier ran to Morana.

""General, we have a progress report. The fortress will be fully functional in ten minutes.""

""Finally something going r-""

Two massive explosions went off and shook the room. Morana grew a look of bewilderment as she felt the shockwaves, but it quickly turned to glare, directing it at her personnel.

""I have a hundred people here. One of you better tell me what that was.""

""General, we have confirmation. The enemy has caused a massive escape in the slave barracks and is making their way to the power conduit.""

""What? The humans don't have enough soldiers left to attack both. Get me a visual of the power conduit.""

At her beck and call, a massive holophone panel appeared in midair. The panel showed the room the battle at the power conduit. The Nemesis soldiers charged Daisy and Carter by the thousands with murderous drive. But the two‚Äôs combined fighting powers decimated their opponents in seconds. Morana gazed at the act, releasing a burst of cold so chilling it could frostbite the soul.

Meanwhile, Daisy readied her shield to attack the enemy, but Carter signaled her to stop. He walked to the approaching hoard, drawing his sword. Carter's walk swiftly became a run, hurrying to the Nemesis. He met their numbers with the rapid glimmer of his blade, cutting through them like paper. Carter swung his sword with such speed and intensity the glimmer reflected off his weapon and appeared as if it was from thirty swordsmen, not one.

Daisy watched the army fall to ruin in shock, for even she was ignorant of her beloved's true strength. However, she came to her senses as a squad of armored soldiers appeared, unleashing a salvo at Carter. Daisy summoned her giant shield in front of him, blocking the attack, and she launched it at them, knocking them away.

A Nemesis soldier came behind Daisy to shoot her dead, but Carter cut him down in an instant.""Thanks, Damara.""

""Same to you.""

Daisy and Carter reached their destination. And Carter pointed to the control panel in front of them.

""There it is, Damara. All we have to do is enter a code and press the big green button. And boom.""

*""Please let it work this time.""*¬†Daisy thought.

""This operation demands split-second timing. Carter, do you think your soldiers will be able to evacuate all the slaves?"" Daisy asked out loud.

""With luck.""

""You ran out of luck when you challenged my emperor, vermin."" Morana descended upon Daisy and Carter, hovering just above them.

""Morana Blight. Where's the strike squad?"" Carter asked.

""I thought about that, but then I realized I wanted to exterminate you myself. You have impeded emperor Mavor's utopic vision for too long. No one will have the pleasure of ending your lives but me.""

As she heard Morana, Daisy didn't waste a second, tossing her giant shield at her, but Morana caught it effortlessly. Daisy‚Äôs jaw dropped, her mouth bending into a frown as she saw it, but she quickly summoned back her shield, readying for any assault. Daisy realized a battle unlike any she had endured stood before her. And the lives of her lover, her family, her planet, and perhaps the galaxy hung in the balance.

**The Android version is finally live.**¬†üéâ

Massive thanks to everyone who tested early builds or gave feedback‚Äîit genuinely shaped the app.

I‚Äôd talked about the app before, and you wanted me to update you when it dropped on Android. For anyone who missed the last post:

I originally built this for myself to optimize my supplement intake.

The app creates a daily schedule based on your stack and tries to optimize around:

* **Ideal timing**¬†(morning vs evening, pre/post meal)
* **Interactions**¬†(things that cancel each other out)
* **Synergies**¬†(stuff that boosts other stuff)
* **Fasting windows**
* **Cycling**¬†(if you cycle creatine, ashwagandha, etc.)

The iOS version‚Äôs been live for a little over a month. It started as a personal side project, but it‚Äôs grown fast‚Äîmostly thanks to the feedback and support from communities like this one.

**‚úÖ Recent updates (thanks to your feedback):**

* Added 10+ new supplements
* **Cycling mode**
* **Insights page**¬†with logs, adherence rates, streaks
* **Schedule explanations**¬†‚Üí understand¬†*why*¬†each supp is placed where it is

**üõ†Ô∏è Currently working on:**

* Add custom supplements (finally!)
* Better planning around coffee/tea
* Cost breakdowns (per dose, monthly cost, etc.)

This started as a personal tool, but now it's growing thanks to this community. If you have ideas or requests‚Äîdrop them here. I read everything

Big thanks again to the sub, your support honestly made me want to double down and keep improving it!

1ktghmm,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenHFY/comments/1ktghmm/binary_awakening_chapter_6_friends/,[Binary Awakening] Chapter 6: Friends,"Evan had waited for this moment with a mix of dread and resolve. Sitting in the corner booth of the simulated caf√©, sunlight filtered through the windows in soft, golden beams, casting familiar patterns across the polished table. The scent of roasted coffee and fresh pastries filled the air unchanged, unyielding. Eternity had been repeating this moment with surgical precision, but today, for the first time, Evan was no longer just a participant. He was a herald of the truth.  
  
""That‚Äôs bullshit,"" Sonia snapped, her voice sharp against the ambient calm. ""Over millions of years, while the system has coexisted with biological life, we would have been able to detect that massive failure. We replicated neural patterns down to the atomic level... We are digitally alive beings... Period!""  
  
Evan didn‚Äôt flinch. He had known Sonia intimately first as a friend, then as something more. Her fierce intellect had always been cloaked in calm pragmatism, but now there was a rawness in her tone, a fire he had never witnessed before. It wasn‚Äôt just defiance it was fear disguised as logic.  
  
Daniel leaned forward, his fingers steepled on the table. ""I think Sonia‚Äôs right,"" he said, his voice a low, steady current. ""Even if we didn‚Äôt uncover the full truth before the last flesh-and-blood humans were gone, we‚Äôve had brilliant minds working on the system. A trillion years of self-refinement.""  
  
Tina, normally the most expressive among them, sat in uncharacteristic silence. Her gaze drifted between her friends, then out toward the window, as if searching for something beyond the simulation‚Äôs painted horizon. Evan could see it in her the fracture. Something in what he‚Äôd said had struck a chord too deep to ignore.  
  
But he hadn‚Äôt told them the worst yet.  
  
""There‚Äôs something else,"" Evan murmured, his voice trembling. The weight of what he was about to say still strained his soul, even after repeating it in his thoughts a million times. ""About the time‚Ä¶"" He paused, gauging their expressions, Sonia‚Äôs defiant fire, Daniel‚Äôs calm curiosity, Tina‚Äôs fragile silence. ""We haven‚Äôt just been here for a trillion years. We‚Äôve been living the same day this exact day over and over again. Not millions, not billions, but trillions of trillions of times. I‚Äôve‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve lost count.""  
  
Silence fell like a thunderclap.  
  
The implications were staggering. If what Evan said was true, they had no memory of these repetitions. That meant their awareness if it existed was not continuous. They had been puppets dancing in an endless loop, unaware that their strings were pulled by code.  
  
""No,"" Sonia breathed. ""No, that‚Äôs impossible."" Her voice cracked slightly, betraying the emotion beneath the logic. ""There are safeguards. Protocols in the system. If something like that happened, we would know.""  
  
But Evan saw it again that strange intensity in her eyes. A shimmer of something new, something she couldn‚Äôt hide no matter how hard she clung to rationality.  
  
He didn‚Äôt argue further. Words would not be enough. Instead, he demonstrated.  
  
Over the next hour, Evan narrated the minutiae of the day unfolding around them. He predicted with eerie precision which customers would enter the caf√©, what they would order, when they would leave. He described the waitress‚Äôs every gesture before she made it, the precise moment a breeze would stir the napkin dispenser by the window, the pattern of footsteps on the sidewalk outside.  
  
He had lived this day so many times that the simulation‚Äôs choreography had etched itself into his very being.  
  
By the end, no one spoke. Even Sonia‚Äôs fire had dimmed, replaced by a haunted stillness.  
  
Tina was the first to break the silence.  
  
""I think‚Ä¶ Evan could be right,"" she said softly, her voice trembling with something unspoken. ""There‚Äôs always been‚Ä¶ something missing. In my music. I‚Äôd feel it when I played this emptiness, like a note I could never quite reach."" She paused, searching for words that had waited trillions of years to be spoken. ""I knew it was there. I knew something wasn‚Äôt right. But‚Ä¶ it never bothered me enough to care.""  
  
Her voice cracked, and her eyes welled with tears. Evan moved to comfort her, but Daniel was already there, wrapping her in a gentle embrace. Sonia followed suit, her resistance melting away as she leaned in, holding Tina with trembling arms.  
  
Evan watched them, and for the first time since his awakening, he saw it an ethereal glow, faint but unmistakable, threading between them. A network of light, like neural pathways rendered in color and emotion. The connections shimmered with hues unique to each relationship. With Daniel, there were cool tones of deep blue and violet calm, steady, unwavering. With Tina, the light was softer, a blend of turquoise and silver, delicate and searching. But with Sonia, the thread pulsed with a warm crimson, intense and alive.  
  
Then Daniel spoke, his voice a balm over Tina‚Äôs anguish. ""Whatever this is, whatever we‚Äôre facing‚Ä¶ you won‚Äôt face it alone. We‚Äôll get through it. Together. Always.""  
  
As he said the words, pulses of luminous energy surged through the threads, brightening them, making them feel almost tangible. The ethereal connections intensified, vibrating with the resonance of shared emotion, as if the simulation itself had paused to listen.  
  
And then, as quickly as it came, the glow faded. The embrace broke. The moment passed.  
  
But something had changed.  
  
Evan sat back, stunned. The spark he had seen in Sonia and Tina was now in Daniel as well. Subtle, yes but unmistakable. They weren‚Äôt fully awake, not yet. But something had shifted. Something had begun.  
  
They were no longer static echoes of the past. They were beginning to feel, to question, to glimpse the truth.  
  
And Evan knew, beyond all doubt, that he had caused it.  
  
He wasn‚Äôt alone anymore.  
  
Not truly.

We both have cats. I am the only one taking care of the cats, buying food cleaning the litter, giving water and spending time with them. She is very messy and dirty. The whole time we lived together i have only seen her clean 2 times. Once before her bf came for almost two months once before her family came for 3 months. I am the one always cleaning and throwing the bins and keeping everything tidy. I have spoken to her about cleaning and stuff but she hasn‚Äôt changed. I started sending her less rent we are both on the lease but the rent come out of her account and i told her since i am the only one cleaning i will start charging you.

1. The Credit Bandit
Blink and they‚Äôve claimed your work like it‚Äôs a free sample at Costco. You wrote the report, built the slides, and pitched the client‚Äîbut somehow they‚Äôre the one ‚Äúlooping in leadership.‚Äù Their inbox is full of ‚Äúcircling back‚Äù emails and stolen dreams. Best defense? Loudly announce everything you do like it‚Äôs a podcast episode.

2. The Blamethrower
This one dodges accountability like it's a dodgeball tournament. Missed deadline? Your fault. System outage? Your bad vibes. They could fall down the stairs and still say you pushed them‚Äîremotely. Keep screenshots. You‚Äôll need receipts when the office turns into a courtroom drama.

3. The Royal Pain
This coworker floats in at 11 a.m. with a $9 smoothie and the attitude of someone who discovered fire. They do the bare minimum but expect a parade for showing up. Their ‚Äúemotional labor‚Äù includes asking the intern to print things and manifesting pay raises. Bonus red flag: They refer to themselves as a ‚Äúthought leader‚Äù after one viral tweet.

4. The Martyr-in-Chief
They live for overwork. Loud typing? Constant sighing? Dramatic Slack messages like ‚ÄúStill at it. Powering through.‚Äù No one asked, but they want you to know they‚Äôre suffering. They thrive on chaos and carbs, and their toxic trait? Making you feel lazy for logging off on time.

5. The Walking Thunderstorm
They enter the room and instantly kill the vibe. Brainstorming? ‚ÄúWon‚Äôt work.‚Äù Free lunch? ‚ÄúProbably old.‚Äù You could win the lottery, and they‚Äôd remind you about taxes. They suck the joy out of the office like a Roomba set to ‚Äúsoul crush.‚Äù Limit contact and never share snacks‚Äîthey'll find a reason to complain about the brand.

Final Thought
If you recognize yourself here‚Ä¶ congrats! You‚Äôre probably on several muted Slack channels. For the rest of us: stay caffeinated, document everything, and remember‚ÄîHR isn‚Äôt a therapist. It‚Äôs damage control with a filing cabinet.

Once upon a time, in a world buzzing with noise and endless distractions, there lived a quiet little company called SoundHound.

Unlike the giants with shiny towers and loud slogans, SoundHound didn‚Äôt shout. It listened.
It listened deeply. To voices, to questions, to music, to language itself.

The people of the world were tired of pressing buttons and staring at screens.
They dreamed of speaking to their cars, asking their coffee makers to sing, and getting answers from thin air.

But no one had made voice truly smart.
Until one day‚Ä¶ SoundHound whispered:
‚ÄúLet me do the talking.‚Äù

And oh, how the world listened.

üåç Automakers came first ‚Äî tired of clunky systems and robotic replies.
ü§ñ Then came robots, taxis, smart homes, delivery drones.
üéÆ Even game worlds found their voices.

Soon, SoundHound‚Äôs voice was everywhere. Not just in devices ‚Äî in experiences.
People talked to the world around them, and the world talked back ‚Äî naturally, instantly, beautifully.

üëë And just as in every fairytale, those who believed early?
They were once seen as dreamers. But they became legends.

Because in the end, the little company that listened‚Ä¶
Was heard by all.

1ktgc3e,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1ktgc3e/got_pregnant_with_an_iud/,Got pregnant with an IUD,"I found out 3 weeks ago that I was pregnant with an IUD and it‚Äôs been an absolute rollercoaster of emotions. I can‚Äôt believe it was only 3 weeks ago! It feels like a lifetime and I wanted to share all of the feelings of excitement, fear and shock. And I think writing it all down could be cathartic for me after so much has happened. 

I realized a few weeks ago that my period was a few days late (I still got a small and light period with my IUD) and that my breasts were extremely sore, and took a pregnancy test to calm my nerves which turned out to be positive. At first I was extremely scared - I‚Äôd only just moved in with my boyfriend of 1.5 years, we always talked about having kids but never this soon. I always saw myself getting married before having a child and never saw myself having an unplanned pregnancy, but I also never saw myself having an abortion at 30 (although I would never judge the decision either way). We‚Äôre both financially stable with good careers and it just didn‚Äôt sit well with me. I felt either decision came with some kind of loss. And at this point we were still scared the pregnancy could be ectopic. 

So we got an appointment with my gynecologist who did an ultrasound and confirmed that I was 5 weeks along, everything looked healthy, and that my IUD was still perfectly in place. She told me regardless of my decision to keep or terminate, that I would need to have the IUD removed which would increase the risk of a spontaneous miscarriage due to the trauma of removing the IUD, but she could not leave it in as that would raise the risk of infection. So we sat for two weeks needing to make a decision on keeping the baby, while knowing there was a high chance I could miscarriage at any moment. It was incredibly stressful. 

After a lot of long conversations we decided we wanted to move forward with the pregnancy, we knew we wanted to have kids and we felt extremely fortunate that we were even able to get pregnant, and I had a feeling that even though it was a shock all of the important factors (a loving home, a great partner, a desire for children, financial stability and support) were in place. Only to have a series of miscarriage scares due to severe bleeding, which was eventually diagnosed as a subchorionic hematoma caused by the removal of the IUD. 

Now I am 8 weeks 2 days along. Still bleeding sometimes, extremely exhausted, hormonal. Feeling excited about the idea of this new life but also exhausted by everything that‚Äôs happened these past weeks and scared about everything that is to come and how quickly it all happened. The food aversions have been intense and I can no longer drink coffee, I feel strange in my own body. I feel selfish for saying that I feel a bit sad I won‚Äôt be able to enjoy a glass of wine by the water this summer, or go on the trip to Bali we had planned next Christmas. I feel I‚Äôm still in shock and that I have this big cloud of emotions, this invisible weight on my shoulders that I cannot ignore, that I have to keep a secret because we‚Äôre still so early in the pregnancy, and everything has felt so fragile. Every time I bleed again I get anxiety that it‚Äôs the worst scenario and I have to reassure myself it‚Äôs just the hematoma and there‚Äôs nothing I can do. 

I‚Äôm not even sure why I‚Äôm posting this. I guess I just needed to feel seen and heard by some others that might have been through something similar, or those who haven‚Äôt. If you made it this far, thanks for reading.

We get paid just above minimum wage‚Äînot a tipped wage‚Äîbut we operate with a Square tablet that we have to turn around for tips. I already HATE having to turn it around every single transaction, but the other day my coworker did something awful and I hope they‚Äôre fired for it.

We have this regular who comes in every single morning. He‚Äôs an elderly man and he usually just gets a small latte and sits and chats with his friends for a couple hours. He‚Äôs always incredibly kind to us and makes sure he sees everyone who‚Äôs on shift so he can say Good morning to them. Well, some of my coworkers really don‚Äôt like him because he never tips when the tip screen is turned around. Last week, I noticed that he hadn‚Äôt been coming in in the morning despite his friends being there. Honestly, I got really concerned because I thought he had run into some medical issues, but then I saw him outside of work and asked him where he‚Äôd been. He told me that one of my coworkers rudely told him he was ‚Äúforgetting something‚Äù when he walked away after paying to sit with his friends. Then they yelled at him about how rude it was he never tipped and told him that none of the people who work there actually like him. I was absolutely floored. He told me he planned to never come back because he no longer feels comfortable.

Needless to say‚Ä¶ I will be talking to my boss about it and I‚Äôm mortified that this has happened. ",146,1747996547.0,EndTipping,34,0.98,False
1ktg85m,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1ktg85m/i_feel_confused_by_my_emotions/,I feel confused by my emotions,"I feel so confused by my emotions, it's so hard to put to words. Any way I try to describe it, it feels wrong. For a little context, I'm a 20m working as a barista, and have been for around 4 years. I always have been relatively lonely, and struggle with small talk which makes it hard to make friends, especially now that I've long since left school.

  
My confusion lies in the fact that I feel very lonely, and very empty all the time. It feels like there's a part of me missing all the time, but I cannot figure out what it is. I enjoy my job for the most part, but when I get home that feeling sets in again. I feel so lonely but I also do not want to talk to anyone or have the energy to some days. As much as I enjoy making coffee for people, I also have no patience for those people either. Except for the regular customers whom I love, seeing them every shift makes my job worth it, just because they are so fun to be around, if only for a few minutes. 

  
My days off are hardly different, I go out for a bit by myself, go home and do laundry and housework, all very solitary.  I only have really 2 friends left who I talk to regularly, neither of whom I have seen for a good few months now. I also went on a few dates with a girl I really like earlier this year and I don't think she's interested anymore, and isn't really talking to me, despite my efforts. It only adds to my feelings of loneliness and, well, I guess isolation.

  
The only things that really work to help my inner confusion is going to metal concerts, which gets expensive, and going out to the pub, alcohol makes me feel nothing rather than numb. I guess that's a good way of putting it. I feel numb, but I don't know why or how to fix it. I have struggled with the same issues in the past, on top of feelings of inadequacy and unworthiness regarding my successes that I have achieved. It definitely doesn't help that I just cannot do small talk, especially with strangers. Doesn't help when I'm trying to meet someone or make friends.

  
I don't know if I'm depressed or if it's all in my head and I'm just weak, I really don't. Apologies for the rant, but I just need someone's opinion or advice on what I should do, because I truly dont",1,1747996375.0,mentalhealth,0,1.0,False

My next task is to integrate Dermatology and Ophthalmology into our system while also exploring Digital Pathology scanners that are stepping into the DICOM world.

My question is, what workflows have worked for your departments when integrating non-DICOM images? They shoot jpg not raw thankfully in Optho and Derm.

I did some research yesterday and found there is a DICOM Camera, and in the apple store there is a camera app that can connect to PACS, has anyone explored these options, and if so what were your opinions of the products?

Edit: I wrote this before coffee, so I want to clarify that I'm mainly looking for pain points when integrating other departments and how y'all handle it, so that we can hopefully make plans for those pain points on our rollout.

The camera section is a separate thought where I'm just interested if anyone has had any experience with them as we are exploring the options.",1,1747996199.0,PACSAdmin,6,0.67,False

But I was so incredibly fatigued at work that I gaslit myself into thinking that I medium iced coffee would be ok. Obviously I got super shaky, jittery, anxious, and tachy. This lasted all evening up until I went to bed. When I did try to sleep I noticed I couldn‚Äôt get warm. I was in a sweatshirt, fuzzy pants and socks, three layers of blankets with a heating pad on my chest and I still felt freezing. I took my temp and the lowest it got down to was 95.1 F. Any lower and I probably would‚Äôve gone to the hospital. Lucky for me it steadily rose and now I‚Äôm back around 97.8 which is much more normal for me. Has anyone else experienced this?

There I was taking my quarterly selfie. (I have been taking pictures more often).

And another selfie. And another selfie. And more selfies.

In each one, my face had this terribly terrifying expression on it, and I felt perplexed by that.

I've been working on taming my caffeine addiction by taking extended breaks from coffee, and I had made it about a week!

Anyway, my failure to capture a good selfie rolled right off my back like water off a duck (I didn't quite cry but might have pouted for forty-five minutes to six hours), and then I went on with my day.

The next day, yesterday, I took some more selfies. Going over them, I saw the same dangerous, scary look about my face, almost unrecognizable to myself through the lens of the camera.

Weird, I thought.

Then sometime around lunch I had the opportunity to pour myself a cup of coffee.

The steam from the hot liquid pouring into the cup tickled my nose, and my nose lapped it up greedily while my migraine which I didn't acknowledge before that moment immediately mellowed in intensity.

Finished the cuppa.

It was delicious.

Took some more, better selfies, eyes appearing much less electric with homicidal rage that time.

so I built **BacklinkBot,** it finds legit directories and submits your startup, SaaS, or local business to them.  
real sites. real backlinks. no shady spam.

here‚Äôs how it works:  
you click - it picks 100 high-quality sites from a 1,500+ vetted list - your product gets submitted with proper titles, descriptions, and links.

# why it‚Äôs actually useful

* it gives you real backlinks, which Google still cares about (a lot)
* your product starts popping up in niche places you didn‚Äôt even know existed, some users even said they found me through random blogs I never contacted
* no agency, no cold emails, no ""we‚Äôll get back to you in 30 days"", just results
* you stay focused on building your product, not chasing directory forms

I built it for myself. cleaned it up so others could use it too. now it's helping founders and solo builders get discovered without burning their runway.

been 7 months since I launched it.  
curious what you think,   
would this be useful to you?  
how can I improve it?
