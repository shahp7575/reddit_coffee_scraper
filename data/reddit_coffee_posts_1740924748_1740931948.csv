I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. I won’t bring any drama into your life. 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. I am seeking a woman that is in her late 20s to early 30s ideally please.  I want to hear from women that have a good level of maturity

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here 

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy that loves talking on voice chat. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use bad language vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants looking around museums visiting  a nice beach and walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future 

I am a complete virgin and I’ve been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well this is what I’m looking for to get to know someone really well 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it on here because I don't like the word and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. 

I am also someone that would be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way. 

I love salmon my favourite fish and I love avocados they are so good for the skin. I love having nice burgers out and I also make my own from scratch smash burgers making your own is the best way at home. I love Italian food pasta and pizza the proper stuff being close to Italy we get a lot of the authentic Italian food here. 

I love Indian food too curries for me are probably my favourite food out of them all I don’t think you can beat this type of food when it’s done properly. Fish and chips proper English style would also be a favourite of mine. 

Burgers I love five guys and shake shack we had Both of these when I lived in the UK. In France we have five guys but I also love Burger King I love the flame grilled burgers 

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after. 

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test. I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I don’t work at the moment please be okay with all of this from the get go I’ve had terrible trouble trying to find suitable jobs but I have got plans for the future for things I’m not lazy or anything like that. I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work as I said. 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

I don't look my age we all look younger in my family we have strong genes in the family and  most say that I look like i am In my late 20s to early 30s I have a young looking face no grey hair at all and a full head of hair I'm not losing My hair at all 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings either and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery.

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear any heavy makeup fake tan fake nails fake eyelashes and fake hair and nails. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort ",1,1740931667.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,1.0,False
1j1u75u,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1j1u75u/the_solo_queue_survival_guide_how_to_win_without/,The Solo Queue Survival Guide: How to Win Without Losing Your Mind (or Your LP),"**Introduction: The Solo Queue Struggle Is Real**

Solo queue is a cruel mistress. You queue up, full of hope, only to be matched with four teammates who seem to think “warding” is a myth and “objectives” are optional. We’ve all been there: the 0-10 Yasuo who’s still typing “ez” in all chat, the jungler who’s AFK farming while your tower crumbles, or the support who “accidentally” takes your cannon minion for the fifth time. It’s exhausting. You try to carry, you ping, you plead—but it’s like herding cats with keyboards. So, after years of grinding and countless therapy sessions, I’ve discovered the *real* secret to winning in solo queue: **don’t try too hard**. Hear me out—this isn’t about giving up; it’s about winning smarter.

**The Core Philosophy: Your Teammates Are Dumb, So Why Bother?**

Here’s the harsh truth: in solo queue, your teammates are a liability. They’re not just unpredictable—they’re actively working against you half the time. You can’t control their feeding sprees, their questionable builds, or their insistence on fighting 1v5 while you’re still walking back from base. And here’s the kicker: most games aren’t decided by the player who carries the hardest—they’re decided by the guy who ints 10x more than anyone can possibly compensate for. One feeder can undo all your hard work, no matter how fed you get. So why waste your energy trying to be the hero every game? The answer is simple: **minimize your effort, preserve your sanity, and let the game play itself out**. It’s not laziness—it’s strategy.

**The Strategy: How to ""Don’t Try"" Your Way to Victory**

Here’s how you put this philosophy into practice. Follow these steps, and you’ll be climbing the ranks without the stress-induced bald spots.

1. **Pick Braindead Champions**
   * High-skill champs? Overrated. You don’t need flashy mechanics when your teammates can’t follow up anyway. Stick to champs so simple you could play them half-asleep: Garen, Annie, Malzahar. They’re low effort, they scale, and they don’t require your team to have a functioning brain. Less room for error, more time to sip your coffee while your ADC dies again.
2. **Farm Like a Monk, Fight Like a Sloth**
   * Focus on farming peacefully in your lane. Treat minions like your personal Zen garden. Team fight breaking out mid? Take your time strolling over—chances are, it’ll be over by the time you get there, and you can either grab a free kill or just shrug and go back to CSing. Why risk dying with your team when they’re already sprinting it down mid? Let the game come to you.
3. **Mute All and Embrace the Silence**
   * Communication is a trap. Your teammates’ pings are just noise, and their chat is a cesspool of “jg diff” and “report top.” Mute everything—chat, pings, all of it. You don’t need their brilliant “go in” call at 10% HP. Play in blissful silence, and if they spam question marks after you ignore their suicide mission, just pretend it’s applause.
4. **Accept the Unwinnable Games**
   * Some matches are doomed from the start. Your jungler picks Teemo, your midlaner’s trying some TikTok build, or your bot lane’s already 0-6 at five minutes. These games are lost causes—don’t fight it. Instead of raging or trying to 1v9, just chill. Farm a bit, practice your last-hitting, and treat it like a mini-vacation. No point in stressing over a game that’s already a coin flip.
5. **Play for the Long Con**
   * Solo queue isn’t about winning every single game—it’s about stacking small wins over time. By not burning yourself out trying to carry every match, you keep your mental game strong. Tilted players lose LP; calm players climb. Studies show (okay, I made this up, but it sounds right) that players who flame less have a 0.0001% higher win rate. That’s science. Play enough games with this vibe, and the LP will roll in.

**The Hidden Genius: It’s Not Throwing, It’s** ***Resource Management***

Now, some of you might be thinking, “Isn’t this just soft throwing?” Wrong. This is about managing your most valuable resource: your mental energy. Solo queue is a marathon, not a sprint, and every game you spend sweating over your teammates’ mistakes is a game you’re not at your best for the next one. By dialing back the effort, you’re dodging the tilt spiral that sends most players plummeting to Iron. And let’s be honest—half the time, your team’s going to throw no matter what you do. That 0-15 guy isn’t your fault. So why bother dragging them across the finish line? Sit back, play your game, and let the chaos unfold. If you win, awesome. If you lose, it was destined to happen anyway.

**Conclusion: The Path to Enlightenment (and LP)**

Solo queue isn’t about outplaying the enemy team—it’s about outlasting your own. You can’t control the guy who runs it down, but you *can* control how much you care. This guide isn’t just about winning games; it’s about winning at life. Stop stressing, start chilling, and watch your LP climb as you rise above the chaos. The solo queue gods favor the relaxed, not the tryhards. So go out there, adopt this approach, and let me know how it goes. Bonus points if you screenshot your teammates’ meltdowns when you don’t follow their 0 IQ calls. See you in Diamond—or at least in therapy less often.

Had to get this off my chest. So I remember this brother from my hall who I had a huge crush on. He had just moved in from another hall, right when my PIMO self started kicking into high gear. He is the pure definition of a “himbo”— He’s taller than me (maybe 6’3, 6’4”?) near his mid-20’s, really kind and handsome, but kind of naive to a lot of things as expected. (And I actually mean that in the best way possible!)

We would hang out and get coffee, cook dishes and try different foods together, and talk about music. In my head, he was what I dreamt of wanting in a partner but ofc he’s heavily devoted. He just got in a courtship, and he’s been desperately trying to introduce me to his girlfriend for a while now.

Earlier this week, he unexpectedly called me, trying to catch up and “encourage me” to come back to the meetings. (For context, in a very weak state of mind I confided in him about my gay feelings but never admitted the crush I had on him.) Then he sent me the messages above earlier this morning.

I thought about finally being honest but being inactive, he still can go to the elders about this. And I haven’t spoken with them nor attended meetings in months. And I understand coming out about those feelings isn’t going to make much of a difference, or at least in my favor anyway.

1j1u4px,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1j1u4px/i_27f_went_through_my_bfs_28m_ipad_and_found_out/,"I (27F) went through my BF’s (28M) iPad and found out he was cheating— now I’ve broken up with him, but I’m second guessing my decision","
A few weeks ago, my BF and I went on a weekend trip for a concert. The day we checked into our Airbnb, we had different plans, and we were supposed to leave the apartment at the same time. However, my friend (who I was meeting up with) got delayed in traffic, so I stayed behind.

While waiting, I noticed my BF had left his iPad on the coffee table. Earlier in our relationship, we had exchanged phone passcodes, and I figured he probably used the same one for his iPad. I was right. Curiosity got the best of me, and I went through his iMessage. My heart sank. I found messages where he had tried to meet up with a girl while I was abroad. She only responded later that evening, saying she was busy, but the fact that he even tried crushed me.

Then, I checked his Instagram DMs. He had been flirting with multiple girls, including exes. Even on my birthday, he was messaging another girl in a flirty way. Later that evening, after I spent time with my friend, I confronted him. His justification? He claimed he was “seeking validation” because I apparently “bring out his insecurities”—all because I had called him out a couple of times for being unresponsive in conversations and I said he was probably just used to coasting in relationships based on his looks. Anyways, he swore nothing ever got physical, and I made him block all those girls so we could “move forward.” The rest of the trip was… okay, I guess.

When I got home, I went for a screening test for peace of mind (thankfully, everything came back negative). I told him to get tested, too. He only did last week because he was “sorting things out” with his medical aid, so he’s still waiting for results.

Since I went through his iPad, I haven’t been able to fully let go of the resentment. I’d make small comments here and there, and things still felt off. Then, last night, we were hanging out while I was dealing with a work crisis (I co-host on Booking.com). He was comforting me here and there, but while scrolling through IG stories, he randomly mentioned that a girl he once told me he had a crush on is in Dubai—with a friend of mine.

For context: I’ve had past drama with this girl over an ex. I only became close to the friend he mentioned recently, but I knew she had been friends with this girl before. I have no idea why my BF felt the need to bring it up, and I found it incredibly disrespectful. I just gave him a side-eye, and he was like, “Say what you want to say.”

I calmed down a little, then told him straight up that he has disrespected me constantly in this relationship. I asked why he even brought that up—what was the point of mentioning her? He tried to apologize, saying he didn’t mean anything by it, but at that moment, I was done. As I was walking out of his place, he asked, “Are you really just going to leave?” I said yes because I was tired of the disrespect. He started to argue but then just went quiet. I walked to my car and drove off.

Later, he texted me saying he hopes I got home safe and apologized again. I replied, saying I don’t want to be with him anymore. He sent one last message, which I left on read basically saying it’s a bummer things didn’t work out, and that was it—we broke up.

Now, I feel sad, but I think it’s for the best. The only thing making me doubt myself is that my period is in four days, and I know my emotions might be heightened. I don’t know if I made an impulsive decision while trying to work things out, or if this was the right call. Would appreciate some outside perspective.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

If you’re between 18-45 and want to get out more, meet new people, and do something different, then Round Table could be exactly what you're looking for!

We’re a non-denominational, non-political social club for men across Great Britain & Ireland who want to have fun, try new things, and give back to their communities. It’s all about making the most of life—whether that means heading out on adventures, having a laugh down the pub, or getting involved in charity and community events.

So, what do we actually do?

Every Table (local group) is different, but we get up to all sorts, including:

🏎️ Go-karting, paintballing, axe-throwing, and escape rooms

🎯 Archery, shooting, golf, and other sports

🚤 Water sports like wakeboarding, sailing, and paddleboarding

🍻 Brewery tours, whiskey tastings, airfryer masterchef!

🌍 Trips abroad, adventure weekends, and festivals

💪 Charity events, fundraising challenges, and community projects

But it’s not just about having fun—Round Table also helps you grow as a person. You’ll build confidence, develop leadership skills, and step outside your comfort zone in a supportive environment. Whether it’s organising events, public speaking, or taking on challenges you never thought you would, you’ll walk away with skills for life.

Get involved internationally! 🌎

Round Table isn’t just local—it’s a worldwide organisation. Members get the chance to travel to international meet-ups, festivals, and exchange programs with Tables across Europe and beyond. Whether it’s a beer festival in Belgium, a skiing trip in Austria, or a world meeting in South Africa, you’ll have mates all over the world ready to welcome you.

What’s the catch?

No catch—just a small membership fee (around the price of a coffee a week). Only payable when you decide you want to be a registered member, so you can see if it’s for you first.

Why 18-45?

Round Table is all about bringing together like-minded men in the same stage of life. It means that as members move on at 45, there’s always space for the next generation of guys to join, take leadership roles, and shape the future of their Table.

But don’t worry—when you hit 45, you don’t have to say goodbye! Most members continue their journey in 41 Club (another club in the Round Table family), where they stay connected and keep enjoying great events.

We've got tables all over the country in Armagh, Enniskillen, Belfast, Mid Ulster (Cookstown area) and Causeway Coast as well as a number of tables down South!

Sound good? Get involved!

I smiled and they came up to me and let the dog say hi, but the moment I put my fingers on their fur I got sad. The dog reminded me of my sweet baby that passed a few years ago. All of a sudden the dog started freaking out and trying to hop into my lap, and started whimpering and just kept shoving its body against me.

1j1tzl4,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1j1tzl4/upgrade_from_chestnut_c2_to_kultra_doesnt_feel/,Upgrade from Chestnut C2 to K-Ultra doesn’t feel like much of an upgrade. (Looking for insight),"I bought myself a 1zpresso K-Ultra for Christmas and I was so excited thinking a grinder upgrade would make a noticeable improvement in my coffee but I don’t feel like it has.

The recipe has been the same 3x coffee amount as bloom for 1 minute then pour the rest of the water. I’m using a 1:16 ratio, 203F/95C water for light roast brew time around ~2:45 with a flat bottom brewer from Loveramics and Kalita 185 filters. 

When I got my K-Ultra  I adjusted it to be about the same grind size I was using on the C2. I grind pretty coarse. I saw some stuff on this sub about grinding coarser and I decided to try it and was blown away at how sweet and delicious the coffee was. I was at 21 clicks on the C2 which is about 8.2 on the K-Ultra.

Needless to say the coffee wasn’t coming out good. I’m confused to why. I figured better grind with other variables the same would equal better coffee but it doesn’t. 

I am now using around a 7 grind size on the K-Ultra and the coffee is good but nowhere near as sweet. Grinding coarser produces cups that lack flavor and grinding finer seems a bit over extracted.

Any insight to why this might be happening and how I can fix it?",1,1740931013.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

If you’re between 18-45 and want to get out more, meet new people, and do something different, then Round Table could be exactly what you're looking for!

We’re a non-denominational, non-political social club for men across Great Britain & Ireland who want to have fun, try new things, and give back to their communities. It’s all about making the most of life—whether that means heading out on adventures, having a laugh down the pub, or getting involved in charity and community events.

So, what do we actually do?

Every Table (local group) is different, but we get up to all sorts, including:

🏎️ Go-karting, paintballing, axe-throwing, and escape rooms

🎯 Archery, shooting, golf, and other sports

🚤 Water sports like wakeboarding, sailing, and paddleboarding

🍻 Brewery tours, whiskey tastings, airfryer masterchef!

🌍 Trips abroad, adventure weekends, and festivals

💪 Charity events, fundraising challenges, and community projects



But it’s not just about having fun—Round Table also helps you grow as a person. You’ll build confidence, develop leadership skills, and step outside your comfort zone in a supportive environment. Whether it’s organising events, public speaking, or taking on challenges you never thought you would, you’ll walk away with skills for life.



Get involved internationally! 🌎

Round Table isn’t just local—it’s a worldwide organisation. Members get the chance to travel to international meet-ups, festivals, and exchange programs with Tables across Europe and beyond. Whether it’s a beer festival in Belgium, a skiing trip in Austria, or a world meeting in South Africa, you’ll have mates all over the world ready to welcome you.



What’s the catch?

No catch—just a small membership fee (around the price of a coffee a week). Only payable when you decide you want to be a registered member, so you can see if it’s for you first.



Why 18-45?

Round Table is all about bringing together like-minded men in the same stage of life. It means that as members move on at 45, there’s always space for the next generation of guys to join, take leadership roles, and shape the future of their Table.

But don’t worry—when you hit 45, you don’t have to say goodbye! Most members continue their journey in 41 Club (another club in the Round Table family), where they stay connected and keep enjoying great events.



We've got tables all over the country in Armagh, Enniskillen, Belfast, Mid Ulster (Cookstown area) and Causeway Coast as well as a number of tables down South!  



Sound good? Get involved!

1j1tx38,https://www.reddit.com/r/pancreaticcancer/comments/1j1tx38/dads_short_battle_and_some_insights_from_his_last/,Dad's Short Battle and some insights from his last days/weeks,"My dad (72m with Type 2 Diabetes) was found to have a mass on his pancreas back in late November following months of on and off stomach flu-like symptoms (diarrhea, loss of appetite, and a swollen abdomen). Blood tests were coming back clean and doctors had no reason to suspect it was cancer until my mother, who suspected something was very off, pushed for a scan.

He received his official diagnosis of Stage 4 pancreatic cancer with mets to the lungs and stomach in early December and the 3 months that followed until his passing yesterday still feel like a blur. His oncologist suggested he could try palliative chemo which my dad initially agreed to, however after talking to a few other doctors he decided against it, knowing there was a chance it may prolong his life but also decrease the quality of it (and we as his family, knowing my dad and his tolerance of discomfort and pain, unanimously agreed it was probably best not to pursue that route).

At his next oncology appointment, a blood and urine test revealed he had acute kidney failure and he was rushed off to the ER where he had nephrostomy tubes put in to drain his urine and later a drain for his ascites. These procedures landed him in the hospital for a week including Christmas day, however he went home on the 26th feeling better and relieved that we could manage the discomfort the ascites had been causing him. At that point, we decided to try some alternative treatments for the sake of trying anything to prolong his time with us. He was also assigned a palliative care team who would come and support my mother and sister in his care.

Unfortunately, it was a pretty much downhill battle from there. His continuous loss of appetite caused him to lose an alarming amount of weight, he became increasingly tired, choosing to rest/sleep for longer and longer windows of time and he went from walking independently to requiring our assistance to needing both a walker and our assistance. However, his main complaint during that period was restless sleep during the night and despite trying different meds and sleep aids, he continued to struggle with that until his last few weeks. Constipation also caused him a lot of discomfort and confusion (supposedly due to the buildup of toxins in the body) at that stage, so we made sure he was eliminating every 2-3 days at most with the help of laxatives when needed and that helped a lot.

Towards mid February it became clearer that my dad needed additional support, and we were told by his palliative care team that we had a couple of days to weeks left so we decided to switch from home hospice care to facility hospice care and honestly it was the best decision we made for everyone involved. My mom and youngest sister rarely left his side throughout his hospice stay and we (his 3 other kids and grandkids) visited him daily. He had one episode of paranoia on his first day there but after that he was more at ease and appreciated the services and support he had access to. He even had coffee and a full breakfast of eggs and bacon in the family dining area on his second day there for the first time in months which was a big yet happy shock. His favorite service had to be the therapy baths though, he could easily spend an hour in there ❤️

The past month leading up to his death (yesterday March 1st) still feels like it was the fastest yet longest month of my life. This is when I spent the most time on here trying to understand what stage Dad was at, how much time we had left with him, and what the 'end' might look like. But his last weeks and days weren't typical nor did they follow the stages of dying in a linear manner (he was always all over that chart even at the end).

I'll try to sum up how it went: he gradually lost what little was left of his voice, whispering at first and then eventually resorting to mouthing and sign language (this was one of the hardest parts for me). He started to have more back pain (which he had mildly throughout the past few months) but thankfully this was well and actively managed with pain meds. He spent most of his time sleeping and his periods of alertness became shorter and less frequent. He stopped eating a week before passing and had a few episodes of vomiting stomach remnants and a green liquid. He stopped drinking any liquids 5 days before passing. He was responsive to our questions (yes/no/one word mutterings) up until a few days before passing but was easily overstimulated by too much talking. During his last few days he was in a semi-comatose, sleeplike state, no longer responding, no longer moving in bed on his own, his mouth drooped open, and his breathing slowed (around 5-8 breaths per minute). We spent those days comforting him with our touch and words, and also saying our goodbyes.

His vitals were always good, he had no skin discoloration until after he passed, no cold extremities (apart from his nose), no hallucinations, and no death rattle. The day he passed, his breathing just became more rapid in general and after 3 gasping breaths with long pauses in between, he transitioned. It was very peaceful.

I know this is quite a long post but I hope it can bring some comfort or understanding like posts here have done for me. I hope you or your loved ones suffer the least possible and get the time to create beautiful memories.

This disease is so so unfair, but I leave this experience with a deeper appreciation for connection, time, and moments that really matter.

Franky our problems did not seem that important. we both had an urge to make out and for a split second when no one could see us we made out more passionately than we ever had up until that point. we decided to leave from the cafe to find a place where we could make out. after 15 minutes of trying to find a place we were unsuccessful but we just started to make out in a half desertes road. however every minute someone was walking to cycling by so instead i grabbed her by the waist and while playing with her boobs from behind started to dry hump and that honestly felt like the best thing i had ever done up until then. alas we had to go from there to as there were a lot of people passing around. i thought that was the end of our date  but oh boy had i never been happier to be wrong. her car was not available so i offered to drop her and she agreed. we got into my car and i asked her to sit in my lap (implying ill do shit) but she refused but she rejected it cause my driver was in the front seat driving the car. when my gf called her mom i slept on her lap without sny sexual thoughts but something about it just made me partially lower her pants and lick her skin above the pussy but she stopped me going further even if she said for me to go deeper. i then started to unbutton her shirt and and starteed to play with her boobs and then sucked her boob like there was no tomrrow. she looked like a hoe in that sceond but a hoe i love most dearly. that went on until we reached her home and somehow by driver didnt figure out what was going on in the backseat partially because it was in the middle of the night but still. that was the day ill never forget and honestly one of the best moments i ever speant with my gf and could not be happier i lost half of my virginty to her.

1j1tsxa,https://www.reddit.com/r/myideasforhumanity_80/comments/1j1tsxa/recognize_you_are_constantly_being_manipulated/,"Recognize you are constantly being manipulated. Here are examples from a marketing perspective. Now imagine other ways you could be manipulated. My idea for humanity is to acknowledge this dynamic daily and at all times. Ask yourself how you could be manipulated, then destroy that point of entry.","Yes, plenty of daily deals or “value” offers seem like a great bargain but actually end up costing consumers more in the long run. Here are a few common ones:

1. “Buy More, Save More” (But You Didn’t Need That Much)
	•	Example: Buy 3 for $10 when each one costs $3.50 individually.
	•	Why It’s a Trap: You might only need one, but you buy extra just to “save,” spending more overall.

2. Large Sizes vs. Multiple Smaller Sizes
	•	Example: A 2-liter soda costs $2.49, while a 20oz bottle is $1.25.
	•	Why It’s a Trap: If you don’t finish the large size before it goes flat or bad, you’re wasting money.

3. Meal Deals at Fast Food Places
	•	Example: A combo meal costs $8, while just the sandwich is $4.50.
	•	Why It’s a Trap: The “deal” makes you buy fries and a drink you wouldn’t have otherwise, adding $3.50 to your bill.

4. Subscription “Savings” That Add Up
	•	Example: “$5 per month for unlimited discounts” at a store.
	•	Why It’s a Trap: If you don’t shop there often, you’re paying for a discount you rarely use.

5. Bulk Discounts That Cost More in the Long Run
	•	Example: 100-pack razors for $50 when a 5-pack is $4.
	•	Why It’s a Trap: If the blades go dull before you use them all, you’ve overspent.

6. BOGO (Buy One, Get One Free) on Perishables
	•	Example: Buy one gallon of milk, get one free.
	•	Why It’s a Trap: If you can’t drink both before they expire, you’re wasting the “free” one.

7. “Free Shipping” with a Minimum Purchase
	•	Example: Free shipping on orders over $50, but your cart is only $35.
	•	Why It’s a Trap: You spend an extra $15 on things you didn’t plan to buy, just to save $5 on shipping.

8. Credit Card Cash Back That Encourages Extra Spending
	•	Example: “Get 5% cashback on dining this month!”
	•	Why It’s a Trap: If you weren’t planning to eat out, the deal makes you spend extra just for the small rebate.

9. Premium Gas When Regular Works Fine
	•	Example: “Premium gas helps your car last longer!”
	•	Why It’s a Trap: If your car doesn’t require premium, you’re just burning money.

10. Extended Warranties on Cheap Products
	•	Example: $20 toaster, with a $10 extended warranty.
	•	Why It’s a Trap: The warranty costs half the product’s price, and the toaster will likely last long enough without it.

Conclusion:

Deals are designed to make you feel like you’re saving, but if you wouldn’t normally buy the extra items, you’re actually spending more. The key is to always ask:
	•	Would I buy this if there was no “deal” attached?
	•	Does the savings outweigh the extra cost?
	•	Will I use everything before it goes to waste?

That’s how you avoid these marketing tricks.

Here are more examples of deceptive daily deals and marketing tricks that make you think you’re saving money but actually make you spend more:

11. “Unlimited” Plans That You Don’t Fully Use
	•	Example: Unlimited data for $60/month vs. 5GB for $30/month.
	•	Why It’s a Trap: If you only use 3GB per month, you’re paying double for data you never use.

12. Grocery Store 10-for-$10 Deals
	•	Example: “Buy 10 for $10” on canned goods or snacks.
	•	Why It’s a Trap: You often don’t need 10 items, but the way it’s phrased makes you think you must buy 10 to get the discount. In many cases, you can buy fewer and still get the same price per item.

13. Hotel Resort Fees Hidden from the Base Price
	•	Example: A hotel advertises rooms at $99 per night, but charges a $25 “resort fee” per night.
	•	Why It’s a Trap: You budget for $99, but your final bill is way higher.

14. High-End Cable Packages with Channels You Don’t Watch
	•	Example: “$99 for 500+ channels!”
	•	Why It’s a Trap: You only watch 5–10 channels, but you’re paying for hundreds you never use.

15. Loyalty Cards That Influence Extra Spending
	•	Example: “Spend $100 and get a $10 coupon for your next purchase.”
	•	Why It’s a Trap: You might buy more than you planned just to reach $100, and then feel forced to return and spend more to use the $10 coupon.

16. Movie Theater Concession Combos
	•	Example: “Large popcorn & drink combo for just $12.99!”
	•	Why It’s a Trap: You would have only bought a small popcorn, but the deal upsells you to a bigger size that costs way more than just getting what you actually wanted.

17. Gym Memberships with Long-Term Commitments
	•	Example: “$10 per month—but only if you sign a 2-year contract.”
	•	Why It’s a Trap: If you stop going after 3 months, you’re locked into paying for 21 months of nothing.

18. Car Lease Deals with Low Monthly Payments but High Fees
	•	Example: “$199 per month for a luxury car!”
	•	Why It’s a Trap: The fine print requires a $4,000 down payment plus mileage fees at the end of the lease, making it way more expensive than it seems.

19. “Limited-Time Offers” That Never Really Expire
	•	Example: “Sale ends at midnight—act now!”
	•	Why It’s a Trap: The deal probably runs every few weeks, but the urgency tricks you into impulse buying.

20. Discounted Gift Cards That Force You to Shop at One Place
	•	Example: “$100 store gift card for $90.”
	•	Why It’s a Trap: You lock your money into a single store, even if you find better deals elsewhere.

21. Amazon “Subscribe & Save” That Gets You Stuck
	•	Example: “Save 5% when you subscribe for monthly deliveries!”
	•	Why It’s a Trap: You might forget to cancel, end up with too much product, or keep subscribing even if you don’t need it every month.

22. “Free Trial” Subscriptions That Auto-Renew
	•	Example: “Try our service for free for 30 days!”
	•	Why It’s a Trap: Many people forget to cancel, and companies make it hard to opt out, so you end up getting charged.

23. Outlet Store “Discounts” Off Fake Prices
	•	Example: “80% off the original retail price!”
	•	Why It’s a Trap: The “original” price was never the real price—it’s inflated so the discount looks bigger than it really is.

24. Fast Food “Upsizing” for Just a Few Cents
	•	Example: “Upgrade to a large fries for only 50¢ more!”
	•	Why It’s a Trap: You didn’t need the extra food, but the deal makes you spend more and overeat.

25. Bank Account Promotions with Hidden Fees
	•	Example: “Get $200 free when you open a new account!”
	•	Why It’s a Trap: The account often has minimum balance requirements or monthly fees that slowly take back that $200 over time.

26. Airline Baggage Fees That Are More Expensive Than the Ticket
	•	Example: “$50 one-way flight!”
	•	Why It’s a Trap: Once you add carry-on fees, checked bag fees, and seat selection fees, your cheap flight costs double.

27. Pre-Packaged “Meal Kits” That Cost More Than Buying Groceries
	•	Example: “$9.99 per meal with fresh ingredients!”
	•	Why It’s a Trap: The same ingredients at the grocery store would cost way less, but you’re paying extra for convenience.

28. Gas Stations Offering a Discount for Paying Cash
	•	Example: “$3.50 per gallon with cash, $3.60 per gallon with credit card!”
	•	Why It’s a Trap: You feel like you’re saving with cash, but if you’re using a credit card with 2% cashback, you might actually be better off paying the higher price.

29. Furniture Stores with “No Interest for 36 Months” Deals
	•	Example: “$0 down, no interest until 2028!”
	•	Why It’s a Trap: If you miss even one payment or don’t pay it off in time, they charge you ALL the interest retroactively at very high rates.

30. “Free” Smartphone with a New Plan
	•	Example: “Get the latest iPhone for $0 down!”
	•	Why It’s a Trap: You’re locked into a 36-month payment plan, and the monthly cost of your phone bill is higher than if you bought the phone outright.

Final Thought:

Most of these tricks rely on impulse buying, confusion, or the fear of missing out. The best way to avoid them is to always calculate the real cost, consider if you actually need the deal, and check for hidden fees.

Here’s a huge list of sneaky “deals” that actually drain your wallet:

31. Dollar Store “Deals” on Small Packages
	•	Example: A 4-pack of AA batteries for $1.25 at the dollar store vs. a 20-pack for $8 at a big-box store.
	•	Why It’s a Trap: The cost per unit is much higher for small packs, making you spend more in the long run.

32. Coupon Stacking That Encourages Extra Spending
	•	Example: “$10 off when you spend $50, plus an extra 15% off your total!”
	•	Why It’s a Trap: You end up buying extra stuff you didn’t plan to, just to hit the spending threshold.

33. Grocery Store “Family Size” That’s Not Actually Cheaper
	•	Example: A “family-size” cereal box for $5.99 (20 oz) vs. a regular box for $2.49 (10 oz).
	•	Why It’s a Trap: Sometimes, the bigger size doesn’t actually save you money per ounce.

34. “New & Improved” Versions That Shrink the Size
	•	Example: Ice cream containers that used to be 64 oz are now 48 oz, but the price stays the same.
	•	Why It’s a Trap: You’re paying the same or more for less product—this is called shrinkflation.

35. In-App Purchases in “Free” Mobile Games
	•	Example: “Free to play! Buy extra lives for just $1.99.”
	•	Why It’s a Trap: A few small purchases can add up to way more than a normal paid game.

36. “BOGO 50% Off” on Expensive Items
	•	Example: Buy one pair of shoes at $100, get the second for $50.
	•	Why It’s a Trap: If you only needed one pair, you just overpaid by $50 for the “deal.”

37. Low Monthly Payments That Add Up Over Time
	•	Example: “$5 per week for this subscription!”
	•	Why It’s a Trap: It sounds cheap, but over a year, that’s $260.

38. Gym “Enrollment Fees” That Seem Small but Add Up
	•	Example: “$10 per month, plus a $99 enrollment fee.”
	•	Why It’s a Trap: The fee erases the savings of the low monthly rate.

39. Fast Food “$1 Any Size” Drinks That Encourage Overconsumption
	•	Example: “$1 for any size soda—why not get the biggest one?”
	•	Why It’s a Trap: You drink more than you need just because the larger size is the same price.

40. “Discounted” Insurance That Reduces Coverage
	•	Example: “Save 15% on car insurance!”
	•	Why It’s a Trap: The company lowers your coverage, so you save money until you actually need it.

41. “Pre-Approved” Credit Cards That Have Hidden Fees
	•	Example: “$500 limit—pre-approved!” but with a $95 annual fee.
	•	Why It’s a Trap: The fees erase the benefits of the card.

42. Grocery Store “Mix & Match” Promotions
	•	Example: “Buy any 5 participating items and save $5!”
	•	Why It’s a Trap: You might buy extra stuff just to qualify for the discount.

43. Gas Stations That Offer Cheap Gas but Higher Prices Inside
	•	Example: “$2.99 gas!” but their snacks and drinks are overpriced.
	•	Why It’s a Trap: They get you inside, where you overpay for convenience store items.

44. “Free Gift with Purchase” That Makes You Buy More
	•	Example: “Spend $75 and get a free tote bag!”
	•	Why It’s a Trap: You spend extra money just to get a cheap freebie.

45. “Clearance” Items That Are the Same Price as Before
	•	Example: A jacket on “clearance” for $49.99, but it was $49.99 last week too.
	•	Why It’s a Trap: Some stores mark clearance items as “discounted” without actually lowering the price.

46. Warehouse Clubs That Make You Buy More Than You Need
	•	Example: 5-pound bags of salad for $5.
	•	Why It’s a Trap: If you can’t finish it before it spoils, you wasted money.

47. “Sale” Prices That Are Just the Normal Price
	•	Example: Electronics marked as “20% off!” but are always sold at that price.
	•	Why It’s a Trap: The “discount” is fake—it’s the normal price disguised as a sale.

48. Restaurants That Automatically Add a Tip but Don’t Tell You
	•	Example: A 20% tip is automatically added, but they still leave a tip line on the receipt.
	•	Why It’s a Trap: Many people double-tip by accident.

49. “Last Chance” Sales That Repeat Every Week
	•	Example: “Final day to save 50%!” … but the same sale comes back next month.
	•	Why It’s a Trap: It’s fake urgency to make you impulse buy.

50. Coffee Shop “Rewards” That Make You Spend More
	•	Example: “Buy 10 drinks, get one free!”
	•	Why It’s a Trap: You might buy more coffee than you normally would just to reach the freebie faster.

51. Flash Sales on Airline Tickets That Aren’t Really Sales
	•	Example: “Flights to Hawaii, only $299!”
	•	Why It’s a Trap: That’s just one leg of the flight—you still have to pay extra fees.

52. “Bonus Sizes” That Cost More Per Unit
	•	Example: A “bonus pack” of detergent with 20% more for $9, vs. the regular size for $6.
	•	Why It’s a Trap: Sometimes the “bigger size” has a worse cost per unit.

53. “No Interest Financing” That Costs You If You Miss a Payment
	•	Example: “No interest for 12 months!” but if you’re late once, all the back interest is charged at once.
	•	Why It’s a Trap: You must pay it off on time, or the interest kills the savings.

54. “Travel Packages” That Bundle Overpriced Extras
	•	Example: “$799 for flight, hotel, and rental car!”
	•	Why It’s a Trap: Booking separately might be cheaper, but they make the package seem like a deal.

55. Online “Sale Timers” That Are Fake
	•	Example: “Only 10 minutes left to buy at this price!”
	•	Why It’s a Trap: The timer resets every time you refresh—it’s not real.

Final Takeaway:

If a deal pressures you to buy quickly, encourages you to buy more than you need, or bundles extras that don’t add value, it’s probably designed to take more of your money rather than save it. Always calculate cost per unit, check fine print, and ask if you’d buy it without the “deal” attached.",1,1740930523.0,myideasforhumanity_80,0,1.0,False

He wanted to get back together but I said no despite my strong feelings for him. I told him I’d want to be his friend if he wanted that too. He’s now suddenly blocked me - after several attempts of trying to get back together. 
I’m left hurt and confused and regretting my choices. 
 
Long version: 

I ran into my ex who was my fiancé of 3 years. I haven’t seen him for over a year since we broke up (for the final time)and I requested no contact. 

Our relationship had become toxic, there were many breakups and make up moments. Out of survival I had to cut off contact to try to get a clean break after he decided to break up and then expressed second thoughts (a familiar pattern at that point). 

I ran into him at a coffee shop a few days after Valentine’s Day and he called me over, asked me if I could sit down and talk for a few minutes. I sat down and we caught up for a few minutes but I couldn’t stay long. He told me what he’s been up to - that he got a new job, started an instagram where he posts his music and Videos and did some acting in commercials. 

The thing is I had to act surprised at all this. I didn’t tell him that I’ve been obsessively checking his socials since our break up, wondering how he has been, if the song he posted was about me etc. I still think of him every day. I’ve had a hard time letting him go and caught myself hoping he’d reach out one day. 

He asked if he could message me later and whether I’d want to get together to catch up. He ended up messaging me that evening, and we ended up talking on the phone for 2 hours. He sent me an invite on ig to follow him and requested to follow me. Again, I was more than familiar with his page and had literally seen every post already. 

He told me he still loves me, thinks about me a lot and wants to try again. I told him I didn’t think I could date him again. That we didn’t work together as a couple despite how much I loved him. 

Since then, we’ve hung out together as ‘friends’. It was honestly cathartic to talk to him about what the last year was like. I told him I cried over him every day for a solid 6 months. 

Though he didn’t express the same detail, he did say it was really hard.

At the end of both our meet ups, he told me he wanted to date me. He told me he loved me and that I was his soul mate. He told me he wanted to marry me still. He said he thinks we are both in a place where we could date and make it work now that we’ve taken time apart. 

These words were all I wanted to hear from him for a year plus. I literally spent so much time thinking about this man and whether we still had a future. 

Though it was super hard, I held strong to my original stance that I couldn’t date him and I didn’t think it would be a good idea. After the last attempt he accepted what I was saying and didn’t try again. He drove me home and was very brief with his response to my message thanking him for a nice day later. 

A week later he messaged me again ‘hi friend, what are you up to?’ I told him I was at the gym. He said ‘so you’re busy then?’ I said ‘yes’. Then he said ‘ok have a good evening’ 

Well later I was thinking about it and I decided to send him a message saying I was grateful for reconnecting with him and although I wanted to see him I didn’t think I was ready for a friendship since I am not over him and I didn’t want to lead him or myself on. 

Well that’s when I realized - he had unfollowed me on ig that evening. He had also blocked me on iMessage - I did not get a delivered or read receipt. 

I don’t know what to think at this point. I understand his need to stop contacting me but I wish he had at least told me he needed that. 
Now I’m hurt and confused and wondering if I made a big mistake. 

I still love him and think I always will. I got what I thought I wanted after so much time pining for him then I turned him down. I’m so confused because my brain and heart cannot agree. ",1,1740930227.0,ExNoContact,1,1.0,False

I(F) have been living in this rented place(in the basement) almost for 5 years and these two(M) moved in this house around September and one guy lives upstairs and other in the basement. That one guy is specially into cooking he can literally be in the kitchen whole day/night and has a high metabolism coz of which he can eat heavy meals every 2-3 hours. I don’t have a problem with him cooking or eating as he is buying his own stuff, but the real problem is he cooks food which have a strong smell full of oil and spices and burns food and stove every single meal which makes the whole basement(specifically) were I live and the upper portion smells heavily. And I on the other side working from home mostly cook one big meal for dinner which I use for next day lunch so that the other housemates won’t be bothered by the smell of food and the noise. I do make coffee in the morning with the Indian bread(simple paratha) without any oil or spices, that doesn’t have any smell. As exhaust fan is not working in the kitchen I have told them to open all the windows in the basement and try to cook extra meal so that others won’t be bothered by their cooking every now and then. They won’t even clean it properly after every use. I have to clean before and after cooking.

But they doesn’t seems to be understanding at all. I everytime put air freshener after they are done cooking but still they are acting all dumb even me and one other housemate have talked about this.
I have been very patient with them but this is affecting my mental health as i am keeping  within myself and I get often headaches because of this strong smell. My room, blankets, clothes everything started smelling like food.

Addition to it, they will have their friends almost 3-4 times per week and will talk in the kitchen while I am working and I have conveyed this thing to them 2 months ago about bringing people from outside that you can bring your friend once in a while that too, you are supposed to take them to your room directly or the living room upstairs coz I am not comfortable being around these many unknown people and they followed for few days but again started doing same things. They bring almost new friend every time from the university. Even, while talking on the phone they keep it on speaker when they are using common areas which irritates me. 

I am from India living abroad and the 2 guys are from the neighbouring country and cook almost similar cuisines as people in India cooks.

For SEVEN FUCKING YEARS I've been deeply embedded in the r/occult Discord server. This wasn't casual browsing – I'm talking 4-5 hours DAILY ,thousands of messages, real connections (or so I thought). I was one of the FIRST to server boost them. I knew everyone. Shared personal shit. Trusted these people with parts of myself I never shared anywhere else.

# How It All Unraveled

It started in January 2024. I couldn't sleep and was browsing both my usual servers when I noticed something that made my blood run cold.

A user called ""TheGreatDivine"" – who we all knew as this mysterious dude who'd post these AI-generated occult poems – was simultaneously active in BOTH r/occult AND r/cryptocurrency Discords. Not just active – but had completely different personas in each.

In our server: deep, spiritual, posting about astral projection and ancient symbols.  
In crypto: talking about federal regulations and ""maintaining observation protocols.""

**WTF?!**

I screenshot it before he could delete anything. That was just the beginning.

# The Rabbit Hole Gets MUCH Deeper

I downloaded this Discord backup tool from GitHub (DiscordChatExporter) and spent THREE STRAIGHT DAYS going through YEARS of message histories, connecting patterns.

What I found left me physically sick:

* A hidden channel called ""rep-handbook"" in the crypto server containing what looks like ACTUAL FEDERAL AGENT GUIDELINES. We're talking coded language, surveillance protocols, and profile management instructions.
* Dozens of screenshots showing server admins terminology and memes like ""fbi coffee,"" ""fbi office"" and ""subject monitoring""
* Yamamushi (our main admin who I've had PERSONAL CONVERSATIONS with about my spiritual journey) referring to community members as ""larp targets"" and discussing ""actionable intelligence""
* Evidence that rayn3085 (who everyone thought was just an annoying troll posting weird memes) was DELIBERATELY flooding channels to disrupt real conversations whenever they ventured into certain topics (especially government monitoring)

**The ""LARP"" Was The Operation Itself**

Remember how they'd always joke about ""LARPing""? Turns out, this is ACTUAL FBI TERMINOLOGY. They literally call their Discord infiltration strategy ""Live Action Role Playing"" – it's in their fucking handbook! They flood channels with nonsense and memes to dilute serious conversations and make everything seem like harmless fun.

I found MULTIPLE instances where I was asking serious questions about government surveillance were immediately bombarded with stupid reaction gifs and derailing memes from accounts now CONFIRMED to be operated by the same people.

Whether it’s talking about what I’ve been up to or just unwinding over a good cup of matcha, I appreciate real convos and genuine connections. Looking for someone open to building something meaningful, bonus points if you’re down for spontaneous dates!

What you're in for ( I’m 5’6 btw, so let’s get that out of the way) :

* Engineering undergrad, which means I like to tinker with stuff and occasionally nerd out about engineering. Expect random fun facts and overanalyzing everyday things.
* The gym is my happy place, I lift 4-5x a week just because I love it. 
* Living independently, so I’ve got my life together, cooking, budgeting, and keeping my place clean are second nature to me.
* Driven & Goal-Oriented. I have my own ambitions, and I’m working towards it 
* Currently battling a growing pile of books, so if you’ve got good recommendations, let's add it to the pile.
* Texts > Calls (Not a fan of phone calls, but I yap a lot in person!)
* Matcha > Coffee (But hey, we don’t have to love the same things.)

What I’m hoping for:

* Someone who is empathetic and self-aware, someone who understands emotions, respects others' perspectives, and takes accountability. Basically, a decent human being with a good heart.
* Smart & mentally stimulating, I love conversations that make me think and challenge me. Bonus points if you enjoy random topics.
* Age preference: Maybe younger (-2) or older (+1) than me
* Values health & fitness, whether you’re already active or thinking of starting, I’d love to have a partner who prioritizes a healthy lifestyle. (And if you need help getting started, I got you!)
* someone who sees relationships as something worth investing in. not just for the sake of dating but someone who sees dating as a way to build something meaningful and lasting.
* Physical attraction matters too, I believe chemistry is important, so we can swap pics early on to see if we vibe.



If you think you're what im looking for, please submit the ff:

* 1x1 picture ( whole body )
* Birth certificate
* NBI clearance
* Barangay Clearance
* Resume

Life was fine, but it’d been a while since he felt that spark, you know? 

Then one day, scrolling online, he stumbles across my [Skullbunker store](https://www.skullbunker.com) and spots this vector design I cooked up: “Kiss the King” – bold, cheeky, with a crowned skull giving a sly grin..

He grabs the t-shirt, throws it on, and something clicks. Maybe it’s the way it fits, or how it turns heads when he’s grabbing a flat white. 

Suddenly Hector’s strutting a bit taller, cracking jokes with the crew, feeling like he’s in on something cool. It’s not just a shirt – it’s his little rebellion, his quiet win.

That’s the kind of thing I love about designing for print-on-demand. It’s not just art; it’s a vibe that lands with someone like Hector. Made it with my vector skills, shipped it from Skullbunker, and now it’s out there making a day better.

I work hard, I'm loyal and I'm honest. I deliver. If my boss ask me to jump, I ask how high and try to jump 150% higher than what is expected from me. One of my ex-boss once called me a ""loyal servant"" in front of the executives at the Christmas party.

Through no fault of my own, I was let go from my organization due to restructuring. I am the primary provider for my family, and like many of you, I have a mortgage and family expenses. My wife cried. I became depressed and didn't want to play with my children. (sorry, this is not meant to be a sob story)

The unemployment period only lasted a few months. After accounting for the severance package I received, I only ate into a small portion of my emergency funds. I landed in a place that is less ideal to where I used to be, and the pay is lower but now at least I have a job. I think I am already one of the lucky ones.

Reflecting on these past months, I don't ever want to be in this vulnerable position ever again. Fearing my financial stability, I begged for jobs from people on LinkedIn who I thought would at least entertain a coffee chat, only to be ghosted. I feel ashamed of how desperate I became, and it showed during job interviews where I sounded like a complete door mat.

I don't deserve what I went through, and neither do you. Many people go through unemployment periodically and I shouldn't feel I'm special in any way, but I don't want my family's well-being placed in the hands of other people ever again. I see people who have multiples businesses and investments that provides them with multiple incomes streams. For these people, if one thing didn't work out, they still have 4 or 5 other things providing income. For me, if I lose my job, I have nothing else that I can support my family with financially.

I am mid-way in my career and I have accumulated a lot of knowledge and experience working for other people and creating wealth for others. Now, I have very mixed feelings about continuing the status quo with my career.

1j1tbhe,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1j1tbhe/my_boyfriends_shittyex_tried_to_destroy_us_but/,My boyfriend's ShittyEx tried to destroy us but made us stronger,"Hello reddit this is my first time writing and, as long as English is not my first language, I apologise for all the spelling/grammar mistakes.
My boyfriend Adam (42m) and I (39f) have been together for the last 8 years. Until 2020 his ShittyEx were part of our lives and we struggled to made her happy but eventually she canceled us. 
Adam and I had a fast start: we meet on a brunch with mutual friends, we chat through our phones that afternoon and in the evening I invited him to my place for what was ment to be a quick one but ended as a couple: we begin seeing each other almost every day and even started an small business together like a year later.
Since the beginning we talked to each other about anything that matter and I am proud of saying that I started that great communication on purpose, trying to improve what I have done in my past relationships.
As we met older, we were aware we had lived a life before. We both were divorced (no kids) and we both had very good relations with our exes. We talk about the last ones as some kind of ""best friends"" for what we have shared with them. For me it seemed perfect, as I value a lot my relation with my late ex, let's call him Charlie (44m). We would telephone each other any time something important happens (a good or bad new), to seek some advice or to vent about family/life, because we know each other circumstances and empathise a lot. We even sometimes call on advice about our new relations, as we know what make us divorce and what are our weakness and strengths, but we never give advice about that if not asked. But even if we are emotionally close, we live separated lives and we are ok about maybe don't see each other in a few months. If a lot of time has passed, any of us will say something like: ""Hey, we haven't hang out for a while, what about eating or a coffee?"", and we try to find some time to catch up, but with no hurry or obligation.
I thought that it would be the same with his ex, let's calle her Beth (39f), but no. Really soon I could see that their relation was not as casual as mine with Charlie. If Adam didn't see Beth in more that a week, she will come with things like ""did you forget about me?"" and he HAVE TO find time to see her. Also, if she had some kind of problem, he had to leave everything to help her. Our first problem (me and Adam) was when we have been seeing each other like 6 months and we have been talking about him joining me on my business (I could use some help and he was excited to work by himself) and we have programmed some work-related meetings: it was my idea that we have to separate dating and working, and we have to set times for ""business-time"" if we want it to be real. We have just started our meeting and she then called because her vitroceramic cooktop didn't work and she wanted Adam to fix it. He said that she was really stressed because was her first time renting on her own and was afraid of telling the landlord and she couldn't handle the situation. On the moment I said ok and use the time for my stuff but the other day I sat him and told him calmly that I won't start a business with someone that can leave me for some non-emergency call, that I would understand if Beth were injured or in a dangerous situation but she could have call some to-go food and wait for Adam to end the meeting. Then I heard for the first time what at some point became usual: ""It's complicated because Beth isn't well"", relating to some anxiety issues because of hypothyroidism. I told him that although I try to be comprehensive that dealing with her anxiety was her job to do and that I am very serious about my business and if he wanted to build something with me as partner I need someone I can trust and that I know is committed. Besides this, I also told him that, as ""friends with benefits"" (we were not in a proper relationship yet) he can leave me while we were hanging together to cheer up a friend, of course, but if it became something usual maybe could affect our relation and, although I was not going to revenge or something, it could lead to me loosing interest in us if I felt left out. He appreciated the way I explained myself and promised to deal with that better in the future.
When we met, Adam told me that they have split in good terms but at some point I discovered that it was not so real: we started having some sexual issues because after the initial months when I wanted to have sex all the time and he joined me happily, at some point I was no longer as active as I was, and I realise he NEVER took the iniciative on sexual activities. After a while I confronted him about being so passive on the start (if I started he will join and also lead but he will never start an approaching) and he broke down. He confessed that he and Beth used to have sexual problems, and that they hadn't had intercourse in their last 10 years, and if he tried to leading her out, it eventually imply her crying a lot complaining about how she ""wanted to feel like doing it but she just can't get herself to feel like it"". He suggested seeking counseling (for her or for both), trying some new stuff (like going to a shop and buy something to play with, no way nothing kinky like swingers clubs or anything like that as she thought it was disgusting and nasty) or whatever she wanted but she was stucked on that she was OK and eventually she will recover her desire. Also, on their last years, she would not touch him, not even to put him sunscreen and she put a fortress of pillows in the middle of the bed as they only had one, alegating sleeping problems. This brought to Adam some self-esteem issues and a mental block at taking initiative to have sex. He was traumatised bc of her behaviour, but it would take us years to discover how deeply he was touched and begin to heal that.
The most ironic thing is her doing her final degree project about how disabled people was deserved to have a proper sexual life through sex helpers while they were still a couple, but a celibate one.
Whatsoever, at some point, Beth started to date Dani (35M), who was a cutie pattotie dude: she was her first girlfriend, he is an IT guy a little bit nerd (but handsome!). Soon after we four started having 4-dates on Beth's or Adam's place (never mine because if I wanted to make a dinner at my place I prefer to invite other friends of mine and never Dani's as he was still living at his parents house) and we four really get along well. I am kind of nerdy too and Adam and I were working on a project where we wanted to use some Arduino so it was really cool to chat about that, even it was a little bit annoying that those conversations never could stand long. Beth used to cut them by going back to her usual topics: Talking sh*t about her workmates or, the best or the best: THE GOOD OLD TIMES. She and Adam used to told us stories about the time when they met, when they were living abroad and struggling for money and for make a living far from home, or when they came back to our country and everything was hard (2008 crisis) and they had to work a lot, eat only mac&cheese, live on a shitty flat... at first it was so cool knowing about how Adam was when he was young but when you hear a story for the 4th time... and even worse, they eventually get to a certain point where the 2 disagree (some idiot thing like in what year happened something or if somebody were o weren't at some story) and they will start a non-stoppable argue about that, other times it could be about other stupid topics like if now the parents are too over protective or were ours too carefree and as they were unable to ""agree to disagree"" they will try to convince each other about their point. Some times Charlie and I could leave the table to chat about any other thing leaving them on their stubborn fight. If Charlie stayed on the discussion as a viewer -as the conversation was so hot we were not able to participate-, I often go to bed leaving them there.
As long as we see each other one night at the weekend or every two weeks I was OK with that, convincing myself that they were their only family close (as his family lives like 6 hours apart and hers the same but on a different part of the country and I have a very big family from my mum and my dad and we have a lot of family gatherings and they are really important for me).
But ShittyEx was not willing to settle and proved our patience until she made our relationship unbearable. Ironically she was the one who called it quits when we started setting boundaries.

1j1ta3l,https://i.redd.it/710uqdu5oame1.jpeg,Next Level Pulsar deserves to be your 3rd brewer,"I (Alan) personally own far too many brewers, and I finally bought a Pulsar just for some continued education with our wholesale manager. I didn’t expect it to be anything special.  I’ve found myself reaching for it again and again. It’s displaced the Clever on my top-3 list. 

Maybe a hot take for r/pourover, but if you could only own one brewer, it should be Aeropress, ideally the XL. It is the easiest, most consistent brewer, and it lets you change every variable completely independent of the others. It doesn’t require any additional equipment. It’s been my favorite for a very long time and it’s not close.

If you could own two, the V60 presents a totally different cup from the Aeropress, and it’s still the go-to for highlighting nuanced florals and complex acidity. It’s cheap, there are tons of filter options (which are easy to store), and it’s just enjoyable to use. 

The Pulsar doesn’t displace either of those. It doesn’t pull out the same nuances a V60 can. It’s kind of a pain to reset - the filter & grounds never just cleanly drop out, and the brewer walls need washing after each brew. BUT, I really enjoy the coffee it makes. The cups are really sweet and full, somewhere between a Kalita (without the maddening filters) and an Aeropress. 

It’s also remarkably consistent. Even across a wide variety of coffees, there’s very little grind or ratio adjustment needed.  I wouldn’t hesitate to throw a totally unknown coffee into it and trust the first cup is going to be good. It also doesn’t require any pouring skill or a gooseneck kettle.  It doesn’t have some of the catastrophic brew failures like the Tricolate which operates under the same principles as the Pulsar.  It doesn’t tend to choke/clog. It just kinda works. 

While the Pulsar is 8x more expensive than plastic V60, it’s comparable to an Aeropress and cheaper than an Aeropress XL.  PERC doesn’t sell Pulsar drippers; I bought mine directly from Next Level. Scott Rao has also added them to his web store. 

If you could only own 3 brewers, what would they be?

She has always been somewhat glued to her phone, but not like it has been for the past year or so.

She falls asleep at night while on TikTok, and when she wakes up she opens TikTok immediately - even before saying goodmorning to me. She's become extremely lazy in chores around the house as when she's home alone, she is wasting the hours away scrolling and scrolling. The not-being-productive part is something I could live with, I'm not the greatest either.

But what to me is now the biggest and most serious issue is the following. She says she wants to spend time with me, and is disappointed if I want to do an activity alone (for example gaming). But then when I choose to spend time with her (to watch a movie, tv show, whatever) she isn't really here with me. She's in her phone. She's not paying attention, she misses out on half the movie and then says it's boring or complicated, keeps asking me what's going on or misses anything that isn't audible dialogue. As with any addiction, confronting her with this behaviour is not appreciated. I've had multiple arguments that have started because I went to go do something for myself as didn't feel like watching a show with her on her phone.

This is not limited only to when we're at home watching tv. She's on her phone during car rides or on public transport, when we're having lunch or a coffee somewhere, even when we have dinner at either of our parent's place.

I am completely and utterly at a loss here, so much so that I am taking to reddit for any advice. Are there any good resources for people who are in my position? Is there anything I can do to make her see how much this is affecting me, our relationship and maybe more importantly, herself and her own (mental) health?

For context, my female friend never pursue me and always had a bf so thats why I never read into this. However we became friends because of her. Literally she just saw me as a loner and then push herself into my life. So here are the signs. 


1. She initiated the friendship. She told me to get coffee with her and lunch. She even tried to put me in her friend group. 

2. She used to jokingly call me hot. I thought she did it because of I was shy and she was trying to see me flustered. 

3. She laughed at everything I said. She actually laughs at alot of people so idk. 

4. The eye contact was strong. We always held eye contact for minutes. Literally held eye contact with her while she walked into the room. After she was done hanging with some other guys, she came to my study room. 

5. When I got drunk, she always get touchy with me. She made me twirl her and when she gets drunk she get touchy too. 

6. She said my name is a high pitched voice. She even playful tease me alot. 

7. Last one, she usually text me first. We don't really text at all. But she does try to keep up with me every now and then. 

Here's the thing though. She found a new guy friend that she does all the things i listed above. Now I am a nobody to her. She still talks to me but it's causal and she gets turned off easily by me. So it's over. Get this though. That guy friend isn't even her bf. Her bf is out of state so idk if we are validation partners. But I'm just curious that's all.

The cleaning was so damn poor the first night and I didn’t put anything, boom,  next day the envolope had doubled and there was also one right on my bed pillow.  
- I took an expensive tour and at the end the guide, who I fucking paid for the tour, said “please any tips are greatly appreciated and help me so much” then went around to ask directly if we wanted to tip. 
- I took a bus on a tour which basically took us from sight to sight, this bus was part of a closed tour and included in the ticket,  I thanked the driver and he directly said “if you want to tip it would be appreciated” I felt really awkward
- I went to a place that has games for my kids and some of them required tokens which you needed to buy from a person behind a desk, I went and bought the tokens, they asked if I wanted to leave a tip.  Seriously a tip for giving me a few coins 
- I went to a standard food place, 10% in the city in my country is standard tip, anything over that is being very generous.  As I was on holiday I decided to leave 15% (I am holidaying in the same country) and the server said “the standard here is 20%”, because some Americans go and that’s what they tip.  So not only did I tip more than is standard for the country, but I was insulted for it.  

I am kind of a socially awkward person with anxiety.  These situations make me feel extremely uncomfortable and I feel like I am being taken advantage of.  Why the hell does places allow this.  Why do places like hotels think it’s ok for cleaners to directly ask for a tip and put pressure on the stayer for doing their job.  Why do people who do tours request a tip, you just charged me, why not charge more if it’s not enough?

The gist of it was that my employee did not greet the customer, which they assumed was due to their race, so the customer felt uncomfortable, unwelcome, and discriminated against. Upon further searching, this person has left 100+ reviews across the country at random businesses, all coming to the same conclusion. Platos closet? They didn't offer much for my clothes, probably racist. Little coffee shop (theres like 8 of these) Coffee tasted bad, barista looked at me weird, racist. Pet groomer? Took too long to get to my dog, racist. Restaurant (again like 2 dozen of these) server took too long, food was bad, seemed intentionally racist.

This hit me like a slap in the face, because while my employees are white, we live in a black city and have a very diverse customer base and rely heavily on our LGBTQ and POC customers, we couldn't exist without them.

I thought college would be a fresh start for me, but COVID happened and it killed like 90% of my college life, returned back in final year and you know no one comes in final year of engineering as everyone is busy in their internships/out of town/projects and my college ended.

I managed to land a job in a great MNC(2 days a week I have to go to office ) and it has been nearly 1.5 years here as of today, at first it took some time to break me out of my shell but then I eventually communicated with my colleagues, i usually attend the coffee breaks and it was ok. Rest of the time i remain occupied with my work.

So for connections i attended some office parties and I just.. can't vibe with them since I don't drink so they usually get a lot of drunk and make a miss. For the non drinkers, the sample crowd reduces to like 4-5 maybe? In which 3 female colleagues tag together and don't do much interaction until I explicitly tries to bond with them(they're ok in office with me, but for some reason I think they just want to stay as colleagues which I totally respect that's why I back off and don't indulge much in conversation with them)

While rest of the 2 guys who i thought I could vibe with, first one is highly extroverted and although he feels like a great guy, I never really like his disrespectful tone towards me(for example, he offered to drop me home since it was quite late and while in the car, he made fun of me in the conversations like ""heyyy are your deaf af?, can't you hear what I'm saying in the first go?"" or like when he was narrating an incident, I said ""hmm hmm"" like this is a sign of nodding as I'm acknowledging him but he made fun of me as ""ohh why are you interupting me? You speak then"")

Honestly, all of this left me in a bitter taste, no wonder I don't interact much with my colleagues nowadays.

My group, however, is enormous. There are 9 of us (sometimes 8, depending on if one player respawns IRL), and we play on voice chat only. That means every session is a chaotic mess of people talking over each other, rules debates that last longer than combat itself, and my personal favorite: waiting 45 minutes for my turn, only to get interrupted because Chad wants to “quickly"" attempt to seduce the door to open for a 6th time.

So after another thrilling night of ""No, you go first. No, wait, I was in the middle of talking—okay, fine, whatever"", my DM (who is also my boyfriend, RIP me) asks how I’m feeling. I tell him, super casually, “Hey, I don’t think I enjoy playing in a group large enough to qualify for tax breaks, but it’s not your fault.” I didn’t say I was quitting. I didn’t demand a solution.

    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

[\[RoyalRoad\]](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/107535/office-hero)

Ten millennia ago, Sir Benginold the Strong died a hero’s death—until the gods reincarnated him as Ben, a Mail Clerk Specialist with the Excel skills of a concussed goblin. Now, the Towers—eldritch skyscrapers hungry for human ambition—threaten Earth.

Recruited by the shadowy Council of Seekers—who mask the Towers as office buildings—Ben assembles the War Council: a steam-wielding barista, an HR rep whose panic attacks buff allies, and Whitebane the emotional support dire wolf—more ‘occasionally helpful’ than ‘loyal companion.’ Together, they’ll climb the Tower’s cursed floors to slay the ancient evils Ben failed to kill 10,000 years ago. Assuming HR approves the overtime, of course.

Success would redeem Benginold’s past-life failure and save humanity from eternal servitude.

Failure would turn Earth into a battery farm, its emotions harvested to fuel the same malevolent gods who unleashed the Towers. (And yes, Whitebane would be very sad.)

But surviving the Tower is nothing compared to corporate nightmares like synergy-obsessed managers, or Brenda from Accounting—wielding Form 47-B like a dragon’s claw.

Join Ben’s bewildered quest where printers jam at the worst possible moment, fluorescent lights flicker like witchfire, and the real boss battle is within our heroes. If you love the chaos of Monty Python and the Holy Grail, the cringe of The Office, and the camaraderie of Guardians of the Galaxy, clock in, take your mandated break (if Chad allows it and Brenda signs off on the proper documentation), and burn every single Tower down.

(Dental plan pending HR approval.)

Last Halloween, she went to a party where a guy from her class was winking at her. She  didn’t bother to tell me, and she didn’t set any boundaries with him or even tell him she is with someone.

A week or two after that, she asked him to get coffee with her after class, and they hugged when they parted ways. She insists that nothing else happened and that it was just a casual meetup. I had to find this out from a reddit post she made to figure out how much she was into him. She mentioned the winking to me a couple of weeks after.

The real issue started about a week ago,months after Halloween and months since she last saw him, we randomly saw this guy again and  Shortly after seeing him, she texted two of her close friends, saying:

“I just saw the guy from Halloween, I will proceed to fantasize over him for the next few months.”

She uses my pc a lot and her whatsapp was open , so i saw this message and looked for further info. I found that she had texted her friends about him multiple times over the months, made several Reddit posts asking if he might be into her, and overall seemed very fixated on him. However, I also noticed that some conversations had been deleted, so I don’t know the full truth.

I confronted her, and she claims that the “fantasizing” comment was just a joke and that she was simply curious about whether he liked her, which is why she was asking her friends and posting about it. She insists that she never intended to act on anything and wants me to give her another chance.

For me, this feels like emotional cheating. Even if she never physically did anything, the hiding, the secret messages, and the fact that she kept thinking about him for months are all things I can’t get past. I don’t think I’ll ever be able to trust her again, and I want to break up.
She wants us to stay together and wants me to give her another chance.

She used to do it more often, especially when I was younger, and I've asked her a few times to stop. 

A couple years ago I remember we went to Dave n' Busters for my birthday and we were sitting and eating and she wanted to take a picture of us, which was fine in my opinion but she always gets a bit.. specific with them? I'll have to smile a certain way or something or do this or do that and it's really annoying. But my main issue comes from the fact that she always posted them on Facebook. 

I told her that I didn't want to take pictures and she asked me why. So I said ""Because it feels like you only do it for Facebook"". She got quiet and instantly turned cold towards me and was giving me nasty glares over the table, and I apologized for it but she still was in a sour mood for the rest of the day. 

She does that a lot whenever I tell her I don't want to take pictures or I get annoyed about it. I don't really care about her taking pictures every now and then but it's almost every time we go out and I'd just really like to have just a normal day with her. I love going on walks or going to the movies or the coffee shop but she always turns it into a chance to take pictures and it pisses me off. 

But another reason I don't like it is because, as I said earlier, it feels like she only does it for Facebook. I wouldn't call her big on the internet, per say (but then again I also haven't seen her account or anything, but she's talked about herself being semi-popular), but she is friends with a lot of people and knows a lot of big people (specifically in film/horror/artist/just the general convention space) and she's been featured in stuff before. I know my mom's posted about me before, especially when I was younger, and according to my friend she still does. The people she knows also know a lot about me while I know nothing about them or who they even are. She talks sometimes about all these people that want to meet me but I genuinely don't know why. 

She's always tried to put out a ""perfect mom"" image and I honestly wouldn't put it past her to still post about me. My mom's also shared some really personal information about me that I just don't feel comfortable with. I made a Facebook account a while ago to follow her and she found out literally within seconds from somebody on the internet seeing it and sending it to her, and I remember gaining a few followers/friends (or wtv it's called on Facebook, I forget) almost immediately. 

She was pissed off about it and ranted to me about how people could stalk me or how they'd find out where I live. It came off as weird because she's posted so much about us and shared so much personal information. It's just really odd.

And she's lied to me before about not posting about me. I got her to agree to not post me on her account anymore a while ago, and one day I was hanging out with a friend who followed her. I asked to see her account and she was still posting things about me. 

I confronted her about it and she got instantly defensive, asking who showed me or who told me. I told her it was my friend because they follow her and she said ""well not anymore because I'm blocking them if they want to start problems"". I tried explaining to her that I asked to see it and she then turned it on me. ""Why would you want to see it"" ""do you not trust me or something"" ""you can just ask and I'll show it to you"" were some of the things I remember her saying. 

Idk. It all just comes off as super weird to me, and I can't help but be uncomfortable with her taking pictures. She's argued and said that she wants them in case she loses her memory. Maybe this is an asshole thing to say, but I honestly don't believe her when she says that. Am I overreacting?",2,1740927020.0,AmIOverreacting,7,1.0,False

A little context: My living room is on the smaller side, and I need something that doesn’t take up too much space but still has enough surface area for drinks, books, and maybe the occasional laptop. I love the look of round tables since they feel more open and less bulky, but I’m wondering if I’d regret not having the extra surface space of a rectangular one. Also, storage would be a big plus—hidden compartments or shelves for remotes and random clutter would be amazing.

I’ve checked out some options from West Elm and IKEA, but I keep reading mixed reviews on durability. I want something that looks nice but can actually hold up to daily use (and won’t wobble if someone so much as breathes near it). Budget-wise, I’d love to stay under $300, but I can stretch a bit if it’s worth it.

So, what coffee tables do you guys swear by? Any brands or styles you’d recommend (or avoid)? Bonus points if it’s easy to clean—spilled coffee is basically a daily occurrence in my house.

# What is Mindfulness?

Mindfulness is where you focus on being intensely aware of what you're sensing and feeling in the moment (grounding), without interpretation or judgment. Mindfulness is a form of meditation - not too far from yoga, just without the mats and the stretching.[ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6T02g5hnT4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6T02g5hnT4)

# Why is practising Mindfulness / Meditation beneficial?

* Helps you shift your focus from anxiety-provoking thoughts to the present moment 
* Can help break the cycle of anxious or racing thoughts 
* Can help you regain a sense of control and calm 
* Can empower you to take an active role in managing your anxiety and stress levels

# Who has studied the effects of Mindfulness / Meditation?

Meditation has been studied in many clinical trials. The overall evidence supports the effectiveness of meditation for various conditions, including:

* Stress
* Anxiety
* Pain
* Depression
* Insomnia
* High blood pressure (hypertension)

# Where should I practice Mindfulness / Meditation?

The beauty of practising mindfulness is that you can choose activities that suit your circumstances. Below are examples of different techniques you can slowly develop into your routine. Here are some examples  of grounding techniques below:

|**Affirmations**| *These are positive statements that you can say out loud or to yourself* 

When you are carrying out your morning /night routine. Great to do with kids!  [https://www.tiktok.com/@notestosociety?lang=en](https://www.tiktok.com/@notestosociety?lang=en) 

For Kids:[ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XYoduQMAjU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XYoduQMAjU) (Yes - that’s Snoop D.O.GG)|

|**5-4-3-2-1** |when you feel your patience and tolerance lowering, this can be a good way to help calm those waters and bring back clearer head: Start with deep, slow, and long breaths - time to look and acknowledge what you sense- Look around and name **5** things you can see- Focus on **4** things you can feel - Name **3** things you can hear - Notice **2** things you can smell - Focus on **1** thing you can taste

[http://youtube.com/watch?v=30VMIEmA114](http://youtube.com/watch?v=30VMIEmA114) 

|**Mindful eating** |\*You can do this when you're eating lunch or even to de-compress after a long day.\*Try this when drinking a cup of tea or coffee|This involves paying attention to the taste, sight and textures of what you eat.  for example. You could focus on the temperature, how the food/drink feels on your tongue, how sweet it tastes or watch the steam that it gives off.

|**Sitting meditation**|*A few minutes before your break ending or when you are on your way home. Start the process to switch off from work*Sit comfortably with your back straight, feet flat on the floor and hands in your lap. Breathing through your nose, focus on your breath moving in and out of your body. If physical sensations or thoughts interrupt your meditation, note the experience and then return your focus to your breath.

|**Body scan meditation**|

*Just before having a nap or going to sleep for the night|is a great way to help wind down the last part of your day before bed* Lie on your back with your legs extended and arms at your sides, palms facing up. Focus your attention slowly and deliberately on each part of your body, in order, from toe to head or head to toe. Be aware of any sensations, emotions or thoughts associated with each part of your body.

I tend to do my Christmas shopping throughout the year, aiming to buy one gift a month for my fiance (this includes stocking stuffers - he's not THAT spoiled) so that I'm not overwhelmed by the Christmas season.

He's out on travel this week, so it's a good time to order his March gift and get it wrapped before he gets back. Since I just got a reminder about my REI rewards, I thought a camping gift would be a good one to buy so I don't forget to use my rewards. I'm thinking the total would be around $100, so I would spend $40. But, I'm open to going up to $150 total (I spend $110).

We are tent campers with light backpacking. We will typically backpack into a site and stay there a couple of nights and then backpack out. (Though we \*have\* done several day backpacking trips where the hiking was the destination vs a specific location.)

I'm looking for gift suggestions. What are some things that you didn't realize were amazing to have until you got it and then you were like - how did I ever camp without this?

Some things we already feel that way about:

\- Fire glove - amazing for moving logs around on the fire, and super lightweight/negligible for backpacking

\- telescoping bellows - for when you're dealing with wet surroundings, and again, super lightweight/negligible for backpacking

\- lightweight portable chairs - really nice for keeping off the ground

\- portable gas stove and foldable/lightweight pots - because instant coffee is the one luxury I can't give up

\- walking poles - you don't realize you want these until you have them!

So, hit me with some gift ideas outside that you think are a nice touch of luxury (lightweight for backpacking) or a must have that now that you have it, you couldn't camp without. Other things we already have: lightweight axe; tent; sleeping bags; blow up pillows; blow up sleeping pads; hammock; headlamps; handheld lantern; survival kit; gravity water filter; osprey backpacks; carabiners; bungee cords.

I do not want to be resentful... but struggle...,"My husband and have been together 4 years.. I want to be clear that I have no doubt my husband is a good man, a great partner and father and I love him very much. When we met we were both living away from home and I was clear in my want to move back and live near family, who I am very close with, in my hometown. And he agreed to move there with me. We got engaged and married there but unfortunately my husband struggled to settle in the area and became borderline depressed. He didn't make any friendships or join any clubs/sports which he has always been part of in his teens and early twenties. And I struggled to get him out of his head and get him to push himself outside his comfort zone.
After a lot of difficult conversations, we decided to move to his hometown so he could be closer to his family and friends. This was incredibly hard for me, as it meant giving up the life I'd envisioned; living close to my parents, my sister and her kids who I am like a second mother to and giving up my job which I was very happy in and planned to stay in until retirement. 
We are living in his hometown now, which is 4+ hours drive from my home. I know this may not seem long to some, but in my country it is. I am glad to say my husband is much happier however I struggle to accept everything I've sacrificed to be here. Especially since we only see his family about once a week and he isn't very close with his one and only sibling. I worry that I'm sacrificing my own happiness for his. Is it unfair of me to feel like this? I know I should probably just let it all go and move on but it gets to me sometimes...
I am doing everything possible to make a life for myself here. Since moving, we've had a baby and I've made friends with other new mums in mother and baby groups. I've joined a choir to meet other women too and I make an effort to go for coffee/walks with my husband's friends' wives. We've been to counselling and it did help but this feeling bubbles up so regularly for me, I worry I will end up miserable and resentful. I have this gut wrenching feeling that I sacrificed everything for him, yet he couldn't do that for me... I don't know how to let this feeling go.

How do I let go of this resentment? I don't want to be hateful. My husband is a good man and we have a great marriage despite all this. I need perspective! But please try not to be harsh.

TL;DR- before marriage, husband agreed to move with me to my hometown. He struggled to settle there, became borderline depressed and asked me to move to his home, over 4hrs away so he could be closer to his support system. I struggled to do so but eventually moved. I am making a huge effort to make a life for myself here but am feeling resentful at times and wonder if I'm going to be able to cope with all I've sacrificed. Need perspective but please be kind.

A brand new starbucks was recently built by me. I'm about 20 mins from the closest Starbucks in my nearest big city. New Starbucks is fantastic and the staff are wonderful.

Lately when I order at the speaker in drive thru my order has being going through as Clover Vertica instead of just ""iced coffee"". 

The first time I didn't notice until days later when I happened to view my last orders on the app. Yesterday I ordered at the speaker again and Clover Vertica appeared on the screen. I asked (I hate talking through the speaker) if my order was correct as I wanted the regular iced coffee and not the chocolate malt as the app describes the Vertica. Barista was VERY confused and kept saying it's the same exact thing. When I got to the window I showed her my app that under iced coffee there are two separate options one for ""iced coffee"" and one for ""Clover Vertica"" which leads me to believe that they are in fact different. She was totally dumbfounded and said it's the same exact thing and Vertica is the machine that brews the coffee. At this point, as I go to this location almost daily and didn't want to cause a fuss, I just thanked her and left.

Can someone explain to me the difference? From the app it looks like there's a regular coffee, and Clover Vertica is some flavored brew. As long as I'm not being overcharged I really don't care, but why would there be two separate options on the app if it was the e x a c t same thing? At this new location it depends on the barista who takes my order what it's rung up as. I don't mind ordering through the app from now on, as I usually do, but inquiring minds are curious!

1j1s3ia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_Relationships/comments/1j1s3ia/aita/,AITA,"TLDR; Fiancé sent female friend venmo for coffee/breakfast and I haven't been able to let it go. He wants to get married, but I'm holding onto the past. Am I the asshole for asking him to cut her off? 

He has been very close to his friend/coworker. He's in the military and he has female friends, but it never bothered me until this one specific woman's name started being mentioned more often, and I started seeing her name... 

First time he showed me a picture of her back on IG and commented ""she's so bad ass...she's a beast... Etc""I started noticing that he's liking all her pics on Instagram, brushing it off as harmless... 
They're both from Florida and have a history as friends and she was getting stationed out in California where we were living. He started talking about how he wanted me to be friends with her and I kind of just brushed it off as well. 

Second time he started mentioning how he noticed she deleted all her relationship posts with her husband and wasn't wearing her ring anymore. I didn't really think anything of it. 

Third time he mentions how they were ""close"" when he was running in the military and she apparently pushed him to run more. I genuinely started getting jealous because her name just kept coming up. 

The fourth time is when I lost my cool... I was up really late looking through my venmo randomly and coincidentally, I see that he has a transaction with THE SAME WOMAN sending her money with a caption ""for coffeeee"" at 3-4am when he's still supposed to be at work. 
For context, he had NEVER sent me money for breakfast or coffee, nor as he ever gone out of his way to buy food for me, but I have bought food for him on numerous occasions on top of meal prepping for him. 
Needless to say, I kinda flipped. I waited for him to come home and I asked why he was venmoing her money for coffee/breakfast so early in the morning. His answer crushed me, something along the lines of ""I just missed her and wanted to do something nice for her."" 
I sat there feeling defeated... I asked how could he do that for a female friend but never do that for his fiancé who has done soooo much for him over the last 2 years. He didn't even have an answer and responded with basically "" well you never asked....""

He still talks to her and supports her on both of her Instagrams. We got into an argument about him getting lunch with her and her boyfriend and not even mentioning it to me, but last I checked her IG I noticed she's still single.... It just felt like he was hiding it so I wouldn't get pissed off. Me finding out just made it worse. 

Time moved on and he tried making up for it by randomly buying me things which he had never done before, but I just couldn't forgive. I would make snide remarks about him sending women money and it spiraled to more comments about him liking every female ""friends"" picture on Instagram. I've been so bitter, honestly.  
I asked him to cut her off because I'm over dealing with it and I don't want to feel uncomfortable about this crap anymore. Does that make me an asshole?

1j1s38p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/1j1s38p/the_authority_of_the_church_and_the_apostolic/,The Authority of the Church and the Apostolic Mission: A Refutation of Sola Scriptura,"At the heart of Christianity lies the question of authority: who has the power to teach, interpret, and preserve the truth revealed by God? Protestants often adhere to *sola scriptura*, the doctrine that the Bible alone is the ultimate authority in matters of faith and practice. However, this position neglects the essential role of the Church as the guardian of divine truth, a role established by Christ Himself and perpetuated through the apostles and their successors. By examining the scriptural, historical, and theological evidence, I will demonstrate that sola scriptura is both unscriptural and insufficient. The authority of the Church, grounded in apostolic succession and divine mandate, is essential for understanding and receiving the fullness of divine revelation.  

---  

**Faith: Human and Divine**

Faith is the foundation of belief, but not all faith is equal. The Church distinguishes between human faith and divine faith. Human faith is the natural trust we place in others based on their credibility. For example, if someone introduces themselves in a coffee shop and shares details about their life, we might believe them, but our belief is contingent and fallible. Divine faith, on the other hand, is the unconditional acceptance of truth revealed by God. In John 6, Jesus taught about the necessity of eating His flesh and drinking His blood for eternal life—a teaching many found incomprehensible and rejected. Yet Peter responded, “Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life” (John 6:68). This is divine faith: trusting in Christ’s words, even when they surpass human understanding.  

---  

**The Apostles’ Authority: Divine Mandate and Mission**
 
Jesus, who teaches with divine authority, entrusted this authority to His apostles, making them the foundation of the Church. He declared, “He who hears you hears Me, and he who rejects you rejects Me” (Luke 10:16). This transmission of authority is evident throughout the New Testament.  

**Barnabas and Saul: The Significance of Being “Apostled”**

Acts 13:1-3 provides a striking example of the Church exercising its divine authority to commission preachers. In the Church at Antioch, the Holy Spirit declared, “Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.” The Church responded by fasting, praying, laying hands on them, and sending them off. The Greek word used for “sent” (*apesteilan*) shares its root with *apostolos* (“one who is sent”) and underscores the official commissioning of Barnabas and Saul as missionaries of the Church. They were ""apostled"".

**This act of being “apostled” is profoundly significant for several reasons:**

1. The Role of the Church: The Church at Antioch did not merely endorse Barnabas and Saul; it discerned the Holy Spirit’s will and authorized their mission. This highlights the Church’s role as the instrument through which divine authority is exercised on Earth.
  
2. Commissioning with Authority: The laying on of hands signifies more than a blessing—it conveys authority and marks the recipients as official representatives of Christ and His Church. Without this commissioning, their mission would lack legitimacy.  

3. Paul’s Recognition of Apostolic Sending: In Romans 10:14-15, Paul asks, “How can men preach unless they are sent?” (*apostellō*). This rhetorical question underscores that preaching the Gospel requires more than personal conviction; it requires authorization from the Church. The event in Acts 13 demonstrates this principle in action, as Paul and Barnabas were not self-appointed but sent by the Church, confirming their mission’s legitimacy.  

The act of being “apostled” ties directly to the concept of apostolic succession. Just as Barnabas and Saul were sent by the Church, so too does the Church today continue to send ministers who act in the name of Christ. This authority is not self-assumed but conferred through the visible, hierarchical Church established by Christ.  

---

**Oral Tradition and Written Scripture: Equal Authorities**

A key flaw of sola scriptura is its failure to account for the oral teachings of the apostles, which were equally authoritative. Paul writes in 1 Thessalonians 2:13, “When you received the word of God which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men but as what it really is, the word of God.” Here, Paul affirms that his oral preaching is the word of God, not merely human instruction. Similarly, John states in 1 John 4:6, “Whoever knows God listens to us; he who is not of God does not listen to us.” Acceptance of apostolic teaching, both oral and written, is necessary for discerning the spirit of truth from the spirit of error.  

The insufficiency of sola scriptura becomes evident when we consider that much of the apostles’ teaching was never written down. The New Testament, comprising 27 books, cannot encompass the entirety of the apostles’ three years of preaching, teaching, and guiding the early Church. Yet their oral teachings were binding, as demonstrated by the Council of Jerusalem in Acts 15, where the apostles and elders, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, issued a binding decision for all Christians. This decision was authoritative, even though it was not initially codified in scripture.  

---

**Apostolic Succession: The Perpetuation of Authority**

The authority given to the apostles did not end with their deaths. In Acts 1:20-26, Peter initiated the replacement of Judas with Matthias, emphasizing that the apostolic office is an enduring institution. The term “office” (*episkopē*) signifies a position meant to be filled perpetually. This practice continued in the early Church, as seen in the writings of Church Fathers like Ignatius of Antioch, who declared, “Wherever the bishop appears, there let the multitude be; even as wherever Jesus Christ is, there is the Catholic Church” (*Letter to the Smyrnaeans, 8*). Ignatius, a disciple of the apostle John, recognized the bishops as successors to the apostles, holding the same authority to teach and govern the faithful.  

St. Augustine echoed this sentiment, stating, “I would not believe in the Gospel had not the authority of the Catholic Church already moved me” (*Against the Epistle of Manichaeus*, 5.6). Augustine recognized that the Church’s authority is the means by which the Gospel’s inherent authority is made known. The Church is the custodian of divine revelation, ensuring its accurate transmission and interpretation.  

---

**The Infallibility of the Church** 

A common objection to the Church’s authority is the fallibility of its members. Critics point to Peter’s denial of Christ or his failure to eat with Gentiles in Galatians 2:11-14 as evidence against apostolic infallibility. However, these examples highlight the distinction between personal sin and teaching authority. Peter’s actions were fallible, but his doctrinal teaching, such as his declaration at the Council of Jerusalem, was guided by the Holy Spirit and free from error.  

The Church’s infallibility does not mean that its leaders are sinless but that, when teaching on matters of faith and morals, they are protected by the Holy Spirit from teaching error. This charism of infallibility is necessary for the Church to fulfill its role as “the pillar and foundation of truth” (1 Timothy 3:15). Without it, the faithful could have no certainty about what to believe, and the unity of the Church would dissolve into chaos.  

---

**The Bible and the Church: An Inseparable Relationship**

The claim that “a fallible Church cannot produce an infallible Bible” underscores a profound truth. The Bible’s authority is inseparable from the authority of the Church that recognized, preserved, and canonized it. The Church did not create scripture but discerned, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, which writings were inspired. This process was not arbitrary but the fulfillment of Christ’s promise that the Holy Spirit would guide the Church into all truth (John 16:13).  

Protestants accept the New Testament canon, yet they fail to acknowledge the Church’s role in defining it. Without an infallible Church, the canon of scripture becomes a matter of human opinion, subject to doubt and revision. This reliance on human faith, rather than divine faith, undermines the very foundation of sola scriptura.  

---

**My Final Thoughts**

The authority of the Church, rooted in Christ’s mandate to the apostles and perpetuated through their successors, is indispensable for understanding and receiving divine revelation. Sola scriptura, by rejecting this authority, severs the link between God’s revelation and its transmission to humanity. The example of Barnabas and Saul being “apostled” demonstrates the Church’s active role in commissioning and legitimizing divine teaching. To reject the Church is to reject the very means by which Christ continues to teach and sanctify His people.

Ben’s own goblet—now emblazoned with World’s Okayest Employee — felt like a mockery carved into his very bones.

Then he saw her.

The receptionist.

She sat behind a fortress of polished stone (a desk), her golden braids coiled like a serpent’s nest. Ben approached, his dress shoes squeaking like startled mice. Years of battlefield decorum demanded protocol. He slammed a fist to his chest in a salute worthy of a warlord, bowed deeply—

Rrrrrrip.

The sound echoed. The entire left seam of his suit jacket split open, unleashing a bicep that had once strangled a wyvern. A nearby clerk dropped their goblet. Coffee seeped across the linoleum like a tiny brown river of shame.

“Greetings, gatekeeper!” Ben thundered, pretending not to notice the fabric carnage. “I am Sir Benginold the Strong, Slayer of Vyrathis the Devourer, Bane of the Black Marsh, and—”

“Ben! Right?” The woman—Lisa, her nameplate declared—did not look up from her glowing scrying stone. “You’re the new mail clerk. Finally. We’ve been swamped since Greg ate that gluten-free muffin.”

Ben blinked. Swamped? Had the marshlands breached this realm too?

Lisa slid a parchment across the desk. “Sign here, here, and… honestly, just scribble somewhere. HR’s stopped checking.”

Ben stared at the document. The runes swam before his eyes: NDA, W-2, Employee Handbook. “This… contract binds me to your clan’s service?”

“It’s an NDA. Basically, don’t tweet about the coffee machine’s ‘haunting.’” Lisa’s eyes flicked to his ruined jacket. “Love the look, going for an action hero? Cosplay Friday’s not ’til tomorrow, though.”

“I wear no play,” Ben growled, his voice dropping to a graveled battlefield rasp. “These are the shackles of a petty god. Take me to your chieftain. Now.”

Lisa snorted. “Chad’s in a Zoom. But hey—” She held up a finger. “—you’ll get a one-on-one during onboarding!”

“On… boarding?” Ben’s mind flashed to blood-soaked siege ramps, battering rams, the screams of mercenaries. “You mean to storm the gates?”

“It’s just HR paperwork and a benefits slideshow.” Lisa jabbed a lacquered nail toward a humming metal portal (elevator). “Third floor. Follow the neon arrows. Oh, and don’t touch the thermostat. Chad’s weird about it.”

Ben hesitated, clutching his resume like a hostage. “What… is a ‘TPS report’?”

Lisa’s smile sharpened. “You’ll beg for mercy by Friday.”

As Ben turned to leave, Lisa thrust a steaming clay vessel at him. “Welcome latte! Non-dairy, extra vanilla, just like Chad prefers.”

Ben sniffed the murky brew. It smelled like a bog witch’s toenail tincture. Suspecting poison, he waited until Lisa’s attention returned to her scrying stone and dumped the liquid into a nearby potted fern. The plant shuddered, then wilted.

“May your roots find peace,” Ben muttered gravely.

The metal portal (elevator) chimed like a temple bell. Ben stepped inside, shoulders brushing both walls. A Nameless in a striped tunic (graphic designer) scurried in after him, eyes glued to a palm-stone.

“Which… um… floor?” the Nameless squeaked.

Ben glared. “I seek the Third Realm.”

The Nameless mashed a button. The doors slid shut.

Silence.

“Your… suit’s ripped,” the Nameless said, sweating.

Ben’s eye twitched. Above them, Muzak oozed from hidden pipes—a lute’s melody, twisted into something soulless and synthetic.

“Scars of battle,” Ben rumbled. “I am Sir Benginold, slayer of the Frost Wyrm of Karak’s Pass. My armor was stripped by a bureaucrat-god, my blade reforged into a goblet.” He brandished the clay goblet. “A goblet that mocks me.”

The Nameless blinked. “Uh. Okay. I’m… Jason? From… Advertising…”

The doors opened. Jason fled.

One of the Nameless (random office clerk) pointed Ben toward a place to rest and wait. The area was a gray linen closet with delusions of grandeur. The walls bristled with parchment (post-its) scrawled with frantic runes: “URGENT!!”, “ASAP!!”, “WHY IS THE PRINTER HAUNTED?!” A flat stone (monitor) glared at him from the desk.

He sat.

The chair shrieked, spun, and nearly capsized.

“Treacherous fiend—” Ben hissed, steadying himself.

A shadow fell across the desk. A Nameless loomed—bearded, bespectacled, smelling of stale mead (Red Bull) and despair.

“You made it Ben! Like I said, I’m Greg. From HR. I’ve heard a lot about you! Let’s get you… onboarded.”

Ben rose, fist to chest. “At last. A fellow warrior.”

Greg sighed, “Sure. Let’s… go with that.”

The office swallowed Ben whole.

Greg—a twitching, clipboard-clutching herald in a striped tunic—had been prattling about “synergy” and “bandwidth” for what felt like an eternity, his words as hollow as a beggar’s alms bowl. Ben’s suit jacket groaned with every step, the polyester stitching hissing threats of mutiny. Ahead, a gleaming metal portal (elevator) yawned open, its innards glowing like a dragon’s gullet.

“This’ll whisk us to Marketing!” Greg chirped, jabbing a button. “They’re our storytellers! Well, slide-deck storytellers. Less ‘once upon a time,’ more ‘let’s circle back’!”

The portal shuddered. Ben braced himself against the wall, half-expecting siege engines to burst through the walls. Instead, a Nameless in a tunic adorned with cartoon ducks (graphic tee) shuffled in, eyes glued to a glowing palm-stone. The doors closed, and the air filled with a sacrilegious lute melody (elevator Muzak).

By the Nine Hells, Ben thought, this is the song of the damned.

The doors opened to a cacophony of clattering stones (keyboards) and shrill incantations. Mortals barked into ancient artifacts (phones), their voices sharp as daggers.

“No, the discount expired at fiscal year-end!” snarled a woman with serpentine eyeliner. “Yes, I’m aware your dog ate the contract—try bleeping harder!”

Greg swept an arm toward the chaos. “The Sales Team! They, uh… forge alliances! But, like, with invoices!”

Ben eyed a nearby scroll (contract) stamped with crimson runes (“URGENT”). “They wage war with parchment?”

“Exactly!” Greg beamed, missing the horror in Ben’s voice. “Oh! Meet Karoline! She’s our, uh…”

“Karen,” the woman corrected, not looking up. “Greg, tell Chad the printer in Accounting just bit Steve. Again.”

Ben’s heroic instincts flared. “A beast needs slaying? Point me to its den.”

Karen blinked. “It’s a PH JetDesk. And Steve’s getting a tetanus shot.”

Greg hurriedly guided Ben back into the metal portal as if Karen’s next words would be a curse upon Greg’s ears. 

The elevator next revealed a shadowy crypt lit by pulsating runes (server lights). Mortals hunched over glowing slabs, their faces bathed in eerie blue light.

“Our IT department!” Greg announced, voice tinged with reverence. “They, they help maintain the cloud!”

A bearded man with crumbs nested in his beard sighed. “Greg, we’ve talked about this. We just fix the Wi-Fi.”

“Ben, this is Dave! And Steve! And Derek.”

Ben studied their glowing stones (screens), etched with eldritch symbols (error codes).

 “You unravel curses here?” Ben growled. 

Derek didn’t look up. ""Mostly we tell Brenda to restart her computer.""

After collecting signatures, the elevator summoned them again, its hum a merciful escape from the chill of the IT oracle’s lair.  

The doors parted to a stench of burnt offerings (microwave popcorn) and despair. Greg gestured to a metal beast (vending machine) devouring coins. “The vending machine! We’ve got Coffee—” He waved a K-Cup. “—and protein bars!” He pointed to a limp ration bar.

Ben prodded the strange wares. “Your clan subsists on… ration scraps?”

“High-protein!” Greg said, as if that explained anything. “Oh! Chad banned protein shakes after the Christmas party incident, but we’ve got Kombucha!”

Ben eyed the murky brew. “Does it… strengthen the spirit?”

“It strengthens HR complaints,” muttered a passing Nameless.

The nourishment nexus (vending machine) and Bean Elixir Ritual Summoning Relic (coffee machine) seemed to call to all the Nameless, but Greg dragged Ben away before he could understand their strange rituals. 

The elevator’s last shudder deposited them before a monolithic oak door. Runes carved into its surface declared: 

CHAD – BRANCH MANAGER

Greg’s cheer finally faltered. “So! Uh. Chad’s our Branch Manager. He’s super chill! Just don’t mention the… uh… gluten-free muffin thing.”

Ben frowned. “A muffin felled warriors?”

Before Greg could answer, the door creaked open. Shadows pooled inside, thick as tar, and the air tasted of sandalwood and impending doom. A voice colder than a frost giant’s heart slithered out:

“Ben. Let’s optimize your potential.”

Greg vanished like a spooked hare.

Ben stepped forward, his dress shoes squeaking their betrayal.

At last, he thought, a worthy foe.

Chad’s office was a tomb of modern sorcery. Glass walls glinted like frozen lightning. Screens flickered with charts and sigils Ben could not understand. The man himself stood with his back turned, silhouetted against a skyline choked with steel spires. His stillness felt deliberate, rehearsed—a predator’s gambit.

Ben’s boots sank into carpet thicker than marsh mud. His suit jacket had fully surrendered, seams split to expose the corded muscle of a man who’d once carried a dragon’s carcass uphill. The laminated badge on his chest read “MAIL CLERK” in bold, accusing letters.

“You’re not supposed to be here,” Chad said, not turning. His voice was a blade dipped in honey.

“But the schedule…” Greg said, before backing away.

“The quivering scribe clutches his temporal ledger?” Ben growled, watching Greg retreat beneath Chad’s warlord’s glare. “The High King’s gaze could split oak—what hope have you?

” He thumped his chest, admiration blazing. “A commander who fells dissent with but a glance! By the Nine Hells, this Chad’s mettle rivals the Frost Wyrm’s!”

Chad pivoted. His eyes were the color of ledgers balanced at midnight. “You reek of… the Tower. Ash and iron. Not a scent this world wears.”

“Speak plain.” Ben’s voice rumbled, tectonic.

A flicker of irritation, “You appeared uninvited. My first instinct was to erase you. Cleanly. Quietly.” He nodded to a painting on the wall, innocuous save for the faint runes etched into its frame. “Then I heard Greg squawking about onboarding. Curious.”

Ben stared. The man’s words were riddles wrapped in fog.

Chad leaned against his desk, arms folded. “The gods sent you. Why?”

“To slay a evil. Find the shadow, remove the rot that plagues this land… and TPS reports?”

“Slay.” Chad repeated the word like a dead language. “This isn’t a realm for slaying. It’s  primarily for… containment.” He tapped a folder. “Your file. Empty. No history. No skills. Just ‘Mail Clerk Specialist’ stamped by divine incompetence.”

Ben’s shoulders stiffened. “I need no file. My deeds are writ in—”

“—blood and ballads, yes. I read that… ‘resume’ once Lisa brought up a copy to me.” Chad’s smile was as smooth as water. “But uselessness has its uses. The gods dumped you here. I’ll wring purpose from that.”

He slid a keycard across the desk. “You’ll sit. You’ll type. You’ll file. And when the time comes…” His gaze drifted to the pendant. “…you’ll answer the call.”

“What call?”

Chad ignored him, turning back to the window. “The Council of Seekers tends the veil between worlds. Towers rise where they shouldn’t. Hungry things stir. We… manage the chaos.” He glanced over his shoulder. “Even chaos in ill-fitting suits.”

Ben’s hand closed around the keycard. It bit into his palm, cold and smooth. “You want me to fight.”

“I want you to file reports and deliver mail.” Chad’s tone sharpened. “But when the Tower calls—and it will—you’ll fight… like my other Consultants.”

Ben’s brow furrowed. “Tower?”

Chad waved a hand. The screens behind him flared to life, flashing images of jagged obsidian monoliths erupting from cityscapes, their peaks clawing at the sky. “Ancient things. Predators. They call the people to their depths. Most die. You?” A pause. “You’ve already tasted their rot. I can tell.”

The air thickened. Ben’s lungs burned with memory—the crumbling sky, the shadow that had seeped into his world like poison.

“Finish your onboarding,” Chad said, dismissal final. “And Ben? Try not to break the printer. IT’s still traumatized from the Muffin Incident.”

\*\*\*\*\*\*

The “computer” glared at Ben, its screen a mosaic of glowing runes (spreadsheets). Greg had left a note: “Type slowly :) :)”

Ben’s fists hovered over the keys. Somewhere, deep in his marrow, the shadow stirred. The Tower’s pull, faint but persistent, hummed like a plucked bowstring.

He glanced at the keycard. Chad’s pendant flashed in his mind—a silver tower, a silent threat.

The printer down the hall shrieked. Karen’s voice followed: “I swear to God, if this thing eats another report—”

Ben’s mouth curled, something between a snarl and a grin.

Let it call, he thought, fingers slamming a key with lethal force. The “A” key shot across the room.

I’ll be ready.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

Last time, I promised you a deep dive into these two cartoon con artists, and I’m delivering. After Mummy Pig’s nauseating announcement of a third piglet—complete with Ariana Grande’s glittery co-sign—I’ve been peeling back the layers of this piggy propaganda machine, and let me tell you, it stinks worse than Daddy Pig’s post-pudding breath. These two need to be exposed, and I’m here to dish the dirt.

Let’s start with Mummy Pig, shall we? She’s always perched at that ancient laptop, tapping away like she’s curing world hunger, but what’s she *really* up to? A little sleuthing—yes, I’ve got my sources—suggests she’s not just balancing the family checkbook. Word on the street (or at least the X posts I’ve been scouring) is that Mummy’s the mastermind behind Peppa Pig Ltd.’s merchandising juggernaut. Peppa lunchboxes, Peppa raincoats, Peppa bloody toothpaste—every time Peppa snorts on screen, Mummy’s cashing a royalty check. And don’t give me that “she’s a working mom” nonsense. Working moms don’t force their kids into scripted puddle-jumping for profit while smirking about how “very important” their remote gig is. She’s a puppet master, pulling Peppa and George’s strings while raking in millions—£1.6 billion in global retail sales last year alone, if the web’s to be believed. That’s no small potatoes, even for a pig.

Then there’s Daddy Pig, the bumbling buffoon with a gut that defies physics and an ego to match. He fancies himself some kind of architectural genius, always droning on about his “very important job” designing houses. But let’s get real—have we *ever* seen one of his blueprints that didn’t collapse into a pile of animated rubble? I’d bet my last bacon strip he’s just a front, a distraction from Mummy’s money-making machinations. Oh, he’s happy to play the fool—tripping over his own hooves and whining about his diet—while Peppa and George are trotted out for yet another TV special or toy line launch. Daddy Pig’s not clueless; he’s complicit. He’s living large off his kids’ labor, and now he’s grinning ear-to-ear about a third little cash cow joining the herd. Gross.

And this third piglet? Oh, it’s already doomed. Before it’s even born, Mummy and Daddy are plotting its debut—probably a “Peppa’s New Sibling” spin-off, complete with Ariana Grande crooning the theme song. I dug into some X chatter, and fans are already speculating about the name—Polly Pig, perhaps?—but I’m here wondering how long until this poor kid’s splashing in branded puddles for Mummy’s bottom line. The cycle of exploitation is so blatant it’s practically a neon sign: have a piglet, milk it for all it’s worth, rinse, repeat. Peppa’s been at it for 20 years, George is stuck as her perpetual sidekick, and now this new one’s lined up for the slaughterhouse of fame. Disgusting doesn’t even cover it.

I’ve been cross-referencing web archives and X posts, and the evidence is damning. Peppa Pig’s empire isn’t some wholesome family affair—it’s a calculated operation run by two greedy swine who’ve turned their offspring into a global brand. Did you know Peppa’s show is banned in some countries for promoting “gangster attitudes”? That’s right—Mummy and Daddy’s parenting has churned out a pint-sized tyrant who bosses everyone around, and they’re laughing all the way to the bank. I even found a leaked memo (okay, a fan theory on Reddit, but it tracks) suggesting they’ve got a 10-year plan to keep this gravy train rolling, with the new piglet as the next big star. Shameful.

So here’s the takeaway, folks: Mummy and Daddy Pig aren’t just annoying cartoon parents—they’re profiteers exploiting their kids under the guise of family fun. Peppa and George deserve better, and this third piglet shouldn’t be born into a life of scripted snorts and corporate greed. I’m not letting this go. I’ll keep digging, keep exposing, until these two are held accountable. Get wrecked, Mummy and Daddy Pig—your days of hiding behind Peppa’s giggle are numbered.

Stay tuned, because this announcer’s got more mud to sling. Next up, I might just take a peek at Ariana’s role in this mess—godmother or accomplice? For now, though, I’m off to drown my outrage in coffee. Catch you on the flip side.",1,1740925636.0,FamilyVloggersandmore,0,1.0,False

The battlefield vanished.

One moment, Sir Benginold the Strong stood knee-deep in ash and splintered bone, his greatsword steaming with yet another dragon’s blood. The next, he found himself in a chamber that defied all reason.

It was neither hallowed hall nor celestial paradise, but a stark, cold-lit vault that smelled faintly of burnt herbs and dread. The walls stretched into eternity, their pallid faces unbroken save for a shimmering, bright red eldritch script that read NOW SERVING: HEROIC REQUESTS. Beneath it sat a being who might have been a god, if gods wore rumpled tunics and glared at stone tablets as though they’d spat in his mead.

“Next,” droned the god, not looking up.

Ben stared. The creature’s voice echoed as if spoken through a warhorn, and its face—if it had one—rippled like a reflection in a storm-tossed lake.

“Is this… the afterlife?” Ben rasped, his throat raw from battle cries and dragon smoke. “I don’t remember being slain…”

The god sighed. A sound like glaciers calving. “Divine Intervention Department. Request filing only. State your business.”

Ben glanced down. His armor, still streaked with gore, felt suddenly ridiculous. “There’s a… thing. A shadow. It’s unraveling the sky. Crops are dying, rivers—”

“Entropy incursion. Tier Five existential threat,” the god interrupted, flipping a page on his tablet. “Standard resolution: heroic sacrifice. You’ll need to—”

“Another sacrifice?” Ben’s gauntlet creaked as he gripped his sword. “I’ve nearly died seven times this decade, once I actually did. Do you know what dying does to a man?”

“Heroic Liability Waiver, Clause 12-B: ‘Soul recalibration post-death.’” The god waved a dismissive hand. “Not my department.”

Ben’s eye twitched. Centuries of battles, of saving ungrateful kingdoms and listening to bards mangle his exploits into drinking songs, and this was his reward?

The god, noticing Ben’s confusion, “The gods, in their infinite pettiness, do what is needed. Here souls are processed, not praised. Welcome to the Divine Department of Redundancy.”

“Just… fix it, help me save the world,” Ben growled, gesturing vaguely upward as if the crumbling sky might hear. “Save the world. Whatever it takes. Make. It. Stop. Tell me what I must do!”

The god scribbled on his tablet. “Request noted: ‘Make it stop.’ Processing…”

“Wait, that’s not—”

“Request fulfilled.” The god snapped his fingers. A sound like a thousand portcullises slamming shut echoed through the void. “Entropy incursion neutralized. World saved. Next!”

Ben gaped. “That’s it? No epic battle? No… I don’t know, fanfare?”

The god leaned forward, his form flickering like a mirage. “Fanfare requires a Tier Three Ceremonial Upgrade. Your account”—he tapped the tablet—“has insufficient cosmic loyalty points.”

“Loyalty points?” Ben’s voice rose. “I’ve saved the world nine times!”

“Eight and a half.” The god squinted at his notes. “The ‘Great Goblin War of Tuesday’ was technically a skirmish. World not in danger. Now”—he produced a crisp scroll—“your parting gift.”

Ben stared at the document. The header read:

SIR BENGINOLD THE STRONG, SLAYER OF VYRATHIS THE DEVOURER:

MAIL CLERK

“Resume? This appears a… scroll of servitude?”

“Reincarnation protocol.” The god’s tone suggested he’d explained this a thousand times to a thousand baffled heroes. “Office job. Moderate-deductible healthcare. Your own personal mug provided. Guard it.”

Ben’s sword clattered to the floor—or where the floor should have been. “I’m a dragonslayer!”

“Transferable skills.” The god ticked off points on his fingers. “Swordsmanship equates to scribing speed. Battle strategy: ledger management. Dragon-slaying:…” He paused. “Conflict resolution.”

“This is madness!” Ben roared. “I demand to speak to your liege lord!”

The god’s form solidified abruptly, his features sharpening into something cold and ancient. “I,” he said, and the word vibrated in Ben’s teeth, “am the supervisor.”

The scroll burst into golden flames, reforming as a bronze sigil pinned to Ben’s breastplate.

NAME: Sir Benginold the Strong, Slayer of Vyrathis the Devourer, Vanquisher of Villains, Wymarc of the Iron Sword (Ben)

TITLE: Mail Clerk Specialist

STATUS: Probationary

“Good luck,” said the god. “When you get the call, answer as you’ve always done, Benginold.”

Ben’s armor dissolved into a strange tunic of coarse, scratchy wool. His sword became a clay goblet etched with runes: “World’s Okayest Employee.”

“DON’T FORGET…IT MOCKS”, still hung in Ben's ears, fading like the echo of a warhorn blown in a canyon. The coldness of the vault pressed in on him, then seemed to ripple outwards. Under his feet, the smooth, solid ground began to shift, a rough gray texture rising to meet his gaze.

Ben stood at the edge of the Cobblestones (cracked parking lot), his uncomfortable footwear (dress shoes) grinding stray gravel beneath his soles. Above him, Obsidian Towers clawed at the heavens, their mirrored scales (glass facades) reflecting the light of the sun. A Horseless Carriage (delivery truck) roared past, belching Burnt Alchemical Sludge (diesel fumes) that coiled around Ben’s legs like smoke-serpents. He snarled, swatting the air as if to cleave an invisible foe.

The tower’s jaw (revolving door) spun relentlessly, swallowing mortals (office workers) whole. A shieldmaiden (woman in a pantsuit) stumbled out, clutching a Goblet (Starbucks cup) like a holy relic. Ben watched, brow furrowed, as the door’s crystalline fangs (glass panels) snapped shut behind her. “Sorcery,” he muttered, his hand drifting to the nonexistent hilt of Dragonsdeathbringer, his greatsword.

Horseless Carriages (cars) clashed in the Battleground of Eternal Roar (intersection), their blinded cyclops eyes (headlights) flaring. A charioteer (taxi driver) leaned on his War Horn (horn), the sound a wyvern’s shriek. Ben recoiled, his Mug of Mockery (World’s Okayest Employee) sloshing Bean Elixir (coffee) onto his Polyester Straitjacket (suit).

“You dare challenge me, steel-skinned cur?” Ben bellowed, raising the mug like a mace. The taxi sped off, its Runic Stamp (bumper sticker—“Honk If You’re Horny!”) flashing mockingly.

A tide of mortals swept past, their Palm-Sized Scrying Stones (phones) casting sickly light on their hollow faces. One scribe (teenager in earbuds) collided with Ben’s shoulder, his Ink Quill (vape pen) clattering to the asphalt. “You tread where dragons fear, whelp!” Ben barked, but the boy scrambled away, muttering “Fucking weirdo…”

Near the tower’s base, merchants (food vendors) peddled Cauldron-Cursed Sustenance (halal cart chicken) from wagons (food trucks) adorned with Glyphs of Gluttony (“$5 LUNCH SPECIAL!”). The stench of Grease of the Damned (fryer oil) mingled with the metallic tang of the Tower’s Breath (AC exhaust).

Wind howled through the canyons (skyscraper alleys), carrying the Whispering Winds. Ben’s cloak (blazer) flapped behind him like a tattered banner as he craned his neck to study the glowing slabs (office windows) far above. “A thousand eyes peer from this Titan’s Helm,” he growled, spotting shadows (workers) toiling behind the glass. “Yet none see the chains that bind them.”

Ben lingered, his calloused palm pressed to the Obsidian Tower’s cold flank. Somewhere within, enemies prowled, and shadow beasts sharpened their claws. The city’s Song of the Damned (distant sirens) wailed. “Aye,” he said at last, hefting his Mug of Mockery. “Let us storm this false stronghold… and see what treachery it guards.”

He stood tall. A warrior-king in a world of… of what he wasn’t quite sure yet.

The tiny chickens (pigeons) swarmed around Ben’s shoes, their beaks clacking against the Cobblestones (sidewalk) as if auditioning for a role in his ire. “Insolent fowl!” Ben barked, thrusting fist at a particularly brazen bird pecking his shoelaces. “In my realm, your kind is roasted over Dragonfire!”

A cough sounded behind him. Ben whirled, dagger raised, to find a slight mortal clutching a Scroll of Eternal Torment (stained manila folder) to his chest. The man’s Polyester Straitjacket (ill-fitting blazer) hung loose, his Shackles of a Petty God (lanyard badge) labeled Human Recourses—Greg. His eyes darted between Ben’s fist and the Sigil of Servitude (Mail Clerk Specialist: BEN) pinned to Ben’s lapel.

“Uh. Ben?” Greg adjusted his fogged glasses, retreating a step. “Chad—uh, the Branch Manager—said you’d be… towering. I’m supposed to… y’know. Orient you. But first I gotta check in with Lisa. The receptionist.” He jabbed a thumb toward the Obsidian Tower’s (office building) spinning mouth, where a shieldmaiden (receptionist) typed furiously behind a Fortress of Polished Stone (marble desk).

Ben relaxed his fist, looming over Greg like a siege tower. “You name me servant to this… glass titan?” He gestured to the tower, “I am Sir Benginold the Strong, slayer of the Frost Wyrms! My blade thirsts for—”

“Yep! Great! Slayin’ stuff!” Greg interjected, backing toward the Tower. “Just, uh… head to the break room on 3. Follow the exit signs. Lisa’ll print your Sigil (badge), and I’ll meet you after I… appease Chad.”

“A quest,” Ben declared, squaring his shoulders. “At last, a worthy trial and direction!” He strode toward the Obsidian Tower, his Boots of Squeaking Betrayal (dress shoes) heralding his approach. The Winged Serfs scattered, one pausing to Tribute (poop) on Greg’s discarded Scroll (folder).

The Obsidian Tower’s spinning gateway—a whirling circle of crystalline panels (revolving doors)—clattered like a war machine as Ben approached. His broad shoulders filled the entryway, the door’s momentum grinding to a halt when his frame jammed between two glass partitions. “Treacherous contraption!” he bellowed, muscles straining as he forced the door forward with a metallic screech. Mortals (office workers) trapped behind him muttered curses into their Palm-Sized Scrying Stones (phones), while a shieldmaiden (security guard) slapped the emergency stop button.

Freed at last, Ben staggered into the Fortress of Polished Stone (lobby), his Boots of Squeaking Betrayal skidding across Dragon-scale tiles (polished marble). He righted himself, adjusting his Sigil of Servitude (crooked employee badge) with a defiant glare at the now-still door.

“A feeble trial,” he announced to no one in particular, “but I am victorious!”

Greg, lingering nearby, buried his face in his hands.

1j1rwh6,https://www.reddit.com/r/HENRYfinance/comments/1j1rwh6/give_me_feedback_on_my_financial_picture/,Give me feedback on my financial picture,"—36 year old couple 

—HHI approx 475k before taxes, in HCOL area

—We didn’t buy too much house (our mortgage is like <20 percent of our take home) and we might want a bigger house one day but we wouldn’t do it without having enough down payment to have our mortgage stay relatively flat 

—We bought used cars and paid them off; appreciate in next 3-5 years we may need to replace them, we’ve talked about splurging on our next cars a bit but we (hope) to still be deep in parenthood so does it make sense to have mice cars that will inevitably get trashed 🙂

—Daycare is killing us (2500/month) but such is life.

— we have two dogs. Between food medicine treats and vets visits plus dog walker 2x day while we’re at work, they’re probably averaging ha 1k+ a month 

—debt: 525k house; 60k debt to be forgiven with PLSF


—I spent past 3 years paying off my debt (200k) from grad school so wish we had put more on our mortgage but paying down debt was the priority.

Combined retirement accounts: 500k 

1 kid college fund: 30k

Roth: 65k

I pivoted to reducing my contribution to 401k from max to 6 percent to get match. Important to note my company gives me profit matching so will likely still get above max contribution. 

Also not planning on investing in any other accounts for foreseeable future. Took us 4 years and six figures to have our first kid and could take us another high five figures for second so we also are trying to keep some cash flow for that potential. 

My question; should we be investing more? I know we’ll be okay if we don’t invest more but I can’t help but wonder if we shouldn’t be packing more away. I’ve always valued financial freedom so the idea of being able To retire early or quit a job I hate without a back up feels like real freedom. However with  very stressful job and with a young kid and the cost of living being so high, I’m actually valuing more in this stage of life conveniences that make my life easier (cleaner, take away coffees) or make me feel more like myself (Botox, healthy meal delivery). 

I’m just anxious that maybe I won’t always be a high earner bc the stress is untenable
Long term and Espc with a second kid and I should be packing more away now. 

Would appreciate any feedback. ",6,1740925307.0,HENRYfinance,34,0.67,False

Based on his past votes (which are available and on record, and easy to look up) and past actions Pierre Poilievre is...

Against Raising the minimum wage

Voted against $10 a day childcare

Voted against the child benefit

Voted against dental care for kids

Voted against middle class tax cuts

Voted against increased support for seniors

He voted to ban abortions (2020)

He voted to cancel Veterans Disability

He voted against workers rights

He voted AGAINST housing initiatives

He voted to raise the retirement age (2012)

He voted to slash OAS/CPP

He voted for scabs

He voted to cancel school lunch programs for children experiencing poverty

He voted against aid for Ukraine

And some non-voting actions:

He refused security clearance

He instructed his MPs to keep silent on gay rights. It is the opinion of Democracy Inc that LGBTQIA2S human rights will be compromised if Poilievre becomes PM

He could care less about the climate

He vowed to “wield the NOTWITHSTANDING CLAUSE “ thereby taking our charter rights away

He has publicly stated that he would not support Pharmacare and Dentacare (at least twice) thereby enriching insurance companies.

He supplied coffee and donuts to the Trucker Convoy who  were funded by MAGA and Russia.

He advocated to replace Canadian money with Bitcoin,  (unregulated , no intrinsic value,)

He scapegoated Trudeau for causing inflation, while inflation was global and Canada had one of the lowest rates in the world

He scapegoated Trudeau for causing the interest rate hikes, while Trudeau has zero power or influence over the Bank of Canada.

He constantly scapegoats Trudeau by falsely claiming (lying) that the air pollution fines are the main driver of inflation in Canada, even though he KNOWS that that is completely false and was proven so.

He advocated for making drug addicts die sooner rather than later (since forced rehab doesn’t work unless an addict WANTS to get clean, and requires violating 2 different human rights).

He clearly stated that he intends to implement MASSIVE austerity cuts and measures on pretty much ALL federal gov’t spending, which would be EXTREMELY harmful, disastrous, destructive, and deadly!

He has publicly stated that he will defund the CBC

He has consistently demeaned journalists who ask salient questions , but will give interviews to extreme right persons, such Jordan Peterson.

He’s not trustworthy, and also a favourite of Elon Musk, which is the worst kind of endorsement you can get. After all Musk also showed support to the far-right in Germany, and is instrumental in the current chaos in the USA.

To me those are not the actions or voting patterns of someone we can trust to act in our best interest. Especially not since he took multiple days before he responded to 47's threats of annexation (waiting to see which way the wind blows perhaps?) 

He is also known for being a bit of an attack dog, as we can clearly see with how he talks about the liberals. And yet, despite that, he has not put any of that energy into attacking Trump, or said much of anything bad against him or his cronies. These are not good signs, and it should all be taken into account.",11,1740925141.0,CanadianPolitics,17,0.72,False

The carpet is on its way out to be replaced by something like American Spirit Natural Hickory Smooth Engineered Hardwood or Downing Red-Oak Smooth Engineered Hardwood.

Afterwards, I'm pretty stumped on what to do, and have a hard time making decisions with a million options. For example, choosing a rug from the zillions available.

Things to know:

* Wall behind the couch is 12ft wide, distance between couch and staircase railing is 15 ft.
* I need a large rug for this space.
* The light is about as good as it gets in these photos. Otherwise, the awning on the balcony keeps it a little shadier.
* It is currently (and recently) painted in Glidden matte color China Doll. It's a light beige-y color that gets darker as the light dims. I'd like to not repaint right now.
* I've been thinking of toning the couch down with surrounding olive greens and browns, maybe mauves? I really don't know or have a strong opinion about color.
* Most people in these condos put their couch up against the staircase railing, but I'd like to avoid doing that. I'm thinking I should at least move it away from the wall it's on now, but am unsure about what to put behind it, as it is slightly curved. Also open to moving it elsewhere (except to the railing).
* Any furniture that is currently against the railing will be donated. The x'ed out table is also going. Anything else can go except the couch (8 ft wide), litter box cover (near the slider doors), and cat tree. I'm curious about furniture suggestions, as I'll at least need a coffee table.
* I'm thinking of creating a pony wall effect where the staircase railing is, by putting two bookcases on either side of a TV unit that are all about the height of the TV table now. (For the record, I measured, and the TV distance/height is currently *perfect* by TVTooHigh standards). Not sure if that'll look sketchy, though.
* My tastes lean a little casual/bohemian, but I also like symmetry and order. I do not like an all out hippy vibe.

Thanks for your help!

I was 99% about to start the pourover, but snuck a look at the roasters page for this and what i found was  mentioned for espresso- i was not prepared for all that goes jnto a pull on my lever, so i crossed my fingers and continued with the pour. 

Could smell some of the fruit right off the grind. 

[quote] Finca Las Camelias is a single farm situated in La Libertad, Huehuetenango, Guatemala. The farm counts 15 ha, and is situated at around 1,790 m.a.s.l. The lot consists mainly of Caturra, Catuai and Bourbon varieties. Las Camelias lot uses an Anaerobic fermentation. After the coffee has been harvested and moved to the mill where the coffee is processed, the ripe cherries are fermented for 36 hours in tanks without water. Afterwards, it is distributed on African beds and let it dry for 20 days at a density of 16kg/m2. Across this time, the coffee is moved to 5 times in one day, depending on the weather, and covered at night to protect it. [/quote]

20 grams/275mls - v60, 200F, 2:45ish, left me with around 225ml of brew when i pulled the v60 off. Feels slightly under extracted. I wonder what it would have been like with the lever pull and a conical. Probably great but underwhelming.
