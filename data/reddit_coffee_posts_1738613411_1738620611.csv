1ih1je4,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongHaulersRecovery/comments/1ih1je4/approaching_8_months_and_feeling_like_myself_for/,Approaching 8 months and feeling like myself for the first time. ≈80% recovered,"I honestly never thought I’d be typing up a recovery post. Like many of you, I felt completely hopeless for a very long time and refused to listen to those that said it would get better. Well, 7 ½ months into this, I’m finally feeling like myself again.

 

**Full story:** June 26^(th), in a grocery store feeling completely normal, I suddenly felt like I was going to pass out. I’ve never felt such extreme dizziness. I was vegetarian at the time and thought maybe I was anemic as I felt the same wave of dizziness 3 days later, then again, then again. In between bouts of dizziness, I felt exhausted, foggy, and weak. July 6^(th), I went to urgent care thinking I had some inner ear infection when I realized that I had gotten sick when I was on tour with my band. 10 days after being home was the grocery store incident. Light and sound sensitivity and concentration was so bad at this time and the headaches ramped up. Urgent care was no help. Told me to drink electrolytes wow. I’ve never experienced such extreme head pain ever in my life. It was accompanied by extreme dizziness, brain fog, out of focus vision, tinnitus, and slurred speech. People thought I was having a stroke when talking to them. Over the course of the next few weeks, I made trips to the ER and started treating this as a normal migraine situation. You know, Sumatriptan, Reglan, ibuprofen, etc. A few mediocre prescriptions and a clean cat scan left me feeling like I was actually dying. ER set me up in July with a neurologist appointment that still hasn’t even happened, that’s on Feb. 13^(th).

Every day from here on out I had a debilitating migraine, fought dizziness, concentration issues, vision issues, fatigue, insomnia, the works. I got my eyes checked a couple of times and overspent on the appointments and low prescription glasses. I don’t need any of that and my eyes are fine. But they keep going out of focus if I relax them. Finally, August rolls around and I get a virtual appointment with a nurse practitioner while waiting for my PCP appointment in October. I get prescribed Propranolol, the leading medication for migraines. Mind you, Long Covid is still not totally on my radar at this point. Right around the time of starting this medication is when I stop drinking alcohol. I had also stopped smoking weed earlier in August due to a terrible evening of an intense migraine and complete mental breakdown. Also, my hair is starting to thin drastically at this point.

 

It was around this time too that I started studying the Long Covid subreddit and the Long Haulers subreddit. I started to realize that perhaps the illness I got in Seattle while on tour over the summer was Covid and this is now a Long Covid situation; not an ordinary migraine due to stress at work. My fiancé’s stepdad has Long Covid but very different and more permanent symptoms so I was still somewhat skeptical. Some follow ups with the NP led to increasing the Propranolol dose and discussing Long Covid; though she didn’t have much to offer and wanted to treat the migraine as such. This is when I stopped drinking caffeine as well as I was learning about high histamine foods. Finally, my PCP appointment finally rolls around and I get more Propranolol; they love this stuff. I was also taking extra strength ibuprofen and acetaminophen.

 

October to the end of 2024 feels like somewhat of a blur of just intense migraine every single day, trying not to get so dizzy, surviving my grueling work hours, getting through shows with my bands, trying to enjoy my new engagement, oh and a Halloween birthday I didn’t really do anything for. Something to note, I had started to get heart palpitations, sort of. I felt extremely aware of my heartbeat and it felt like something weird was going on with it. It felt like anxiety, a heavy heartbeat that feels like it’s skipping and fluttering, but it really isn’t? Very hard to describe this feeling. Doc had me wear a heart monitor for a week. Terrible experience. The heart monitor company sent back the report and said I had a lot of variation in my heartbeat but I have a somewhat rollercoaster of a job and was playing shows so of course my heart’s going to go up and down. POTS was never a thing for me by the way, I know many of you will ask. Anyway, a cardiologist said my heart was totally healthy but still wants to do an ultrasound I think I have coming up soon. At this point, I feel defeated, lost, terrified, impatient, and frustrated that some symptoms have gone away but most are not wavering. And I am continuing to see hair fall out with a dry scalp.

 

Here’s where things make a turn for the better. I came across a post I hadn’t seen before in one of the LC subreddits. This post is talking about all of the same symptoms I have, which for some reason seem to be somewhat unique as many folks are experiencing a much worse LC journey than I. Anyway, this individual said their headaches went away after they started Gabapentin and Celebrex. This turned me on to an entirely different approach to this. This quite possibly is a nervous system issue and not specifically a headache issue. I then thought over a few things: cold plunges are great for your nervous system, something about shocking/stimulating your vagus nerve. Well, cold plunges make me feel great in the rare instances I get to do them back home when I visit. My Uncle is one of those health nuts that have the sauna, cold plunge, hot tub set ups. I have extremely cold hands and feet. This was not unusual as I work outside for a portion of my job and have always had somewhat of cold extremities since losing 135 pounds. I sometimes feel a dull burning sensation on the bottom of my right foot’s arch. Is this Neuropathy? Holy smokes, it might be. Gabapentin is used to treat various nervous system issues such as Neuropathy and Celebrex helps with inflammation. We all know all our bodies are quite inflamed with everything it’s fighting.

 

I send a message to my doctor and get with another one of her NPs to discuss this new route I’d like to take. I’m blessed that my doctor and her NPs are game for whatever I want to try as they are learning about this condition with me. I’m prescribed the Gabapentin and Celebrex first week of January and instructed to check in 2 weeks later. Well, those 2 weeks were the best 2 weeks I’ve had since June 26^(th). Almost 7 months of a daily burning & swelling pressure migraine, tinnitus, out of focus vision, dizziness, anxiety, mood swings, depression, fatigue, hopelessness, I felt like my old self again. I played a show with my band and then stayed out in downtown with my fiancé and her friends to celebrate a birthday till 2am. I haven’t gone out like that since I got home from my summer 2024 tour. The next day, we went to a comedy show and stayed out in San Francisco all night before driving home. The day after, I felt great. Normally, I’d be completely debilitated after even attempting a busy weekend like that.

 

One month into the Gabapentin & Celebrex, messing with doses and weening off Propranolol, I am feeling like I once did. I’m joking around at work and with my friends. I’m moving quicker and I feel sharper. I’m annoying the hell out of my fiancé again ;). I went for a run the other day and felt completely fine after. What? I can exercise again? I’m going for a run after I post this. I started drinking caffeine again. Oh man, I missed coffee so much. I’m still drinking my Heineken 00s since I shouldn’t drink on Gabapentin. I’ll probably still stay away from weed too until I get even better.

 

I’m not 100% by any means. I still feel that pressure in my head if I start to overdo it, don’t eat, or get bad sleep. My tinnitus is quieter but she’s still with me. My vision still goes out of focus sometimes if I let it. And my damn hair is still falling out and my scalp is still so dry. I used to have thick luscious hair that I could dye cool colors. I hope that starts to come back soon.

 

Despite all symptoms I still feel, I feel them differently. They’re less intense. So much so that most of my day, I’ve forgotten about them. That to me is the sign of recovery and why I can confidently make this post. I’ve seen a few “getting better” posts only for them to be like a month into this journey and crash out again. Trust me, I’ve had many moments throughout that I thought I was getting better only to feel my absolute worst 20 minutes later. But this time is different. It’s been about a month of me feeling my best; feeling like I have my life back. This journey is not over, but for the first time, I feel in control and can continue to fight this. I know we like our percentages in this community, so I’d give it a solid 80% recovery.

 

Whatever your symptoms, however long your journey has been, keep going. Just trust your body, trust your research, trust this community, and continue to fight this. I used to tell myself and others this was temporary without fulling believing it. I was gearing up for the impossible task of filing for disability, quitting my bands, and accepting that my old life was basically over. Don’t let yourself believe that you don’t have any fight left, just keep going.

 

Many of the recovery posts in here were inspiring to me and helped me feel at least a bit of hope and optimism. I hope mine could do the same for you.

1ih1j60,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiagnoseMe/comments/1ih1j60/vague_abdominal_pain_and_other_symptoms/,Vague abdominal pain and other symptoms,"38M, American, White, 220 pounds, 5’11”

**Current meds** – Claritin, Singulair, Probiotic, Famotidine, Omeprazole, Zoloft 50mg

**Relevant social habits / medical history**  – Never smoked, Occasional alcohol use (though have been participating dry January), 2-3 coffees / day.  Fairly healthy – slightly elevated cholesterol, workout 4-5 times per week, diet is mediocre, chronic allergies, well controlled generalized anxiety.

**Relevant family history** \- Dad has chronic pancreatitis. Mom, dad, sister, maternal grandma have all had gallbladder removed. Mom (elevated TPO, positive for autoimmune liver, positive ana, chronic fatigue) and sister (RA, fibromyalgia, thyroid issue of some sort) have autoimmune issues. Two maternal uncles have hypothyroidism.

**Sequence of Events**

Early Dec 2024 – Prescribed Doxycycline for Sinus Infection

Dec 22 2024 – Sinus infection persisted after Doxycycline, prescribed cefdinir (5 days).  Several bouts of watery diarrhea followed.

Dec 26/27 2024 – First noticed mid to upper right quadrant abdominal pain.  Pain location is equidistant between navel and bottom of sternum and about 2 inches to the right of midline.  Watery diarrhea still persisting. Started probiotic.

Dec 30 2024 – Visited PCP.  Abdominal pain lab panel showed elevated Calcium (10.3, ref 8.7-10.2), elevated ALT (75, ref 0-44), elevated lymphs absolute (3.3, ref 0.7-3.1), elevated urine pH (8.5, ref 5.0 – 7.5).  All other labs normal.  Abdominal/Pelvic CT ordered as well.

Jan 2 2025 – Had abdominal / pelvic CT with contrast.  Results Normal.  Stool has returned to normal consistency.  PCP ordered HIDA scan to rule out biliary dyskinesia.

Jan 13 2025 – HIDA Scan performed.  Results normal (55 EF).  PCP order Stool Profile.

Jan 16 2025 – Stool shows positive for campylobacter and rotavirus.

Jan 20 2025 – Follow up with PCP.  Not concerned about stool results.  Nothing remarkable from visit other than started on 30 day trial omeprazole and labs ordered.  Calcium 10.4, ALT 57, neg celiac.  Referred to GI.

Jan 28 2025 – Parathyroid workup performed for hypercalcemia.  Vitamin D 30.4 (ref 30-100), PTH Intact 31 (ref 15-65), Calcium 10.1, 24Hr Urine Calcium 160 (ref 0-320).  ALT still elevated at 62.

**Today**

Upper/Mid RQ abdominal pain still persists.  Consistent pain 3-4, sometime increase to 5-6.  Throbbing, pulsating in nature.  Pain refers to mid right back and mid flank consistently.  Sometimes pain is felt in lower right quadrant/pelvis/groin area.  Pain occasionally in left flank and vaguely through rest of abdomen.  Pain is maybe worse when stomach is empty and upon waking in morning.  Pain has maybe gotten better since trial of Omeprazole started.  Pain does not seem to increase with certain foods.  No fever throughout any of this.

**Other symptoms since abdominal pain has started**

ALWAYS hungry.  Like Always.  Can eat a normal sized meal and still want more (this is not typical).  Infrequent, but noticeable heart flutters/palpitations that last for 4-5 seconds. Some occasional pain along right side of mid sternum. Outer and rear hip and upper leg pain.  Spasms in leg muscles and abdominal muscles. Occasional Dizzy/light headedness that doesn’t seem to correlate with any other factors.  Noticeably more irritable and short tempered – a state that used to be the norm but has been much improved with Zoloft and counseling.

**Other symptoms that I have been experiencing for past 3-6 months.  I chalked these up to getting older and chronic allergies but as I’ve researched may be related to what’s currently going on.**

Brain Fog. Forgetfulness (not like me at all). Fatigue. Not motivated at work as much as I used to be. Feel older than I am. Cold fingers and toes.  Tingly fingers and toes.  Weight gain/maintenance despite attempting healthier eating and working out more consistently.  Very thirsty.  Frequent Urination.  Occasional feeling like I still have to go after having a bowel movement and sometimes straining when I do go (maybe constipation). Knee joint pain.

 

What are your thoughts?  At this point, I’m going to see the GI (Feb 11) and lay out all the symptoms to him.  I’m not convinced that my problem is GI related.  I’m thinking it’s more a whole body issue going on that is presenting at GI related.  A lot of symptoms point to parathyroid, but labs are normal-ish.  Based on research, I’m not convinced that the borderline calcium and Vitamin D aren’t telling of something.  What about hypothyroid?  A lot of symptoms point to this.  I’m trying to push my PCP to perform thyroid labs, but he wants GI opinion before he orders more test.  Diabetes seems to fit most of the symptoms as well. My glucose and a1c has always been on the high side of normal. Gallbladder issues that testing is showing okay on? Hepatotoxicity / DILI from antibiotics? Ulcer? Gut microbiome just all jacked up?

What else could it be?  Thanks in advance.

I'm looking for a lease takeover for a luxury studio in HY/HK from 03/01/25-08/31/25 (start date flexible, can do as early as 02/20). It is on the 36th floor in a full amenity building (concierge, pool, sauna, work space, gym, fitness classes, etc.) that is very safe and conveniently located, with a trash chute on the same floor.

She was always friendly with me and found time to talk. She also seemed to trust me enough to tell me about personal struggles. I also gave her emotional support to the best of my abilities, listening her out without discrediting her, joking around to show that it wasn't a taboo subject, giving her a hug if she asked for one, etc.

I thought this meant the floodgates were opened and it was her go-ahead sign to let me traumadump on her. A few months later I started telling her my problems, also looking for support, and she helped me out a lot, actually. She even ofered to do various activities with me if I was feeling down, like take me to the beach or for a walk, or to a museum. My problems were a lot less serious than hers, and yet she put in much more effort.

Because I'd opened up, she tried to tell me her own issues, but I didn't want to listen to school drama or boyfriend drama, so I just gave her fake pep talks and moved on. Eventually she stopped trying, but I kept telling her my problems. 

Then summer came, she gave me a parting gift of something I really liked and I knew she took great lengths to get, I got her nothing. I went back to my parents and we didn't see each other other than the ocassional message, mostly her prodding me about rent and other flat related issues. 

Fall comes, we're in different flats now, but live next door, so we still hang out, we're no longer talking about personal stuff. But then I get a diagnosis for a mental disorder, and it's really killing me inside, I have to tell someone, but my parents wouldn't understand and a lot of my friends now live far away. She invites me out for a coffee and I tell her. She doesn't seem all that suprised about the diagnosis and tries to support me, saying she knows a lot of people just like me. I start thinking she's lying because she can't know that many people and I explode, telling her she's a liar. She's obviously hurt. Then I message her through a mutual, saying sorry for the outbursts and she unblocks me, tells me everything's fine.

We meet up again, but this time she seems distant, she asks me what I want with her. I don't know what to say, so I tell her I want my friend, that I really feel understood by her. I then tell her bad stuff that's been bothering me lately, but she leaves, seemengly shaken up by all the problems I've dumped on her. She blocks me again and when I tried to contact once more through a mutual she said she'd file a restraining order against me.

My partner (22m) and I (21f) are finishing up our undergrad after living in Fort Collins, Colorado for the past four years. We are an outdoorsy couple trying to decide where we should move to next, and we have a few ideas, but are open to advice. To add context, before Fort Collins, we were lifelong residents of rural Illinois and Nashville, Tennessee. We do not have kids and won't be for a while, so we're looking for a fun adventure in a new area!

We love the outdoorsy aspect of Fort Collins (hiking, fishing, vicinity to state & national parks). We also enjoy the cute stores/restaurants/coffee shops that downtown Fort Collins has to offer. What we don't enjoy about Foco is the overpopulation and high cost of living. Like in many places in the US, the homeless issue in Foco is another drawback for us. Additionally, while the nature in Colorado is amazing, it's often difficult to access due to heavy traffic, full parking lots on trailheads, and almost always requiring a permit/timed entry of some kind. We also aren't into skiing or snowboarding. We want our next place to live to have nature that's more accessible and little more off the beaten path, if that makes sense.

As for finances, we are both pursuing a degree in mental health following our bachelors', so we won't be exactly swimming in money, but not broke either. Student loans aren't an issue for us because of our involvement with the military, so we have a bit of financial freedom in that sense. We were able to afford Fort Collins, so we're aiming for a place with equal (but hopefully) lower cost of living.

**We want a city with most/some of the following traits:** 

\- medium to low cost of living (our budget for rent is around $1800/month)

\- greenery- we don't enjoy the dryness of Colorado

\- vicinity to a large body of water (ocean, Great Lakes, lake of any kind, etc)

\- weather doesn't matter, but my partner likes milder/warmer weather but will tolerate the cold. I can do any climate, I don't mind the cold, and maybe even enjoy it :)

\- politically purple/mixed, or even slightly left leaning

\- vibrant trails/parks/outdoor activities

\- decent gym selection

\- job opportunities in the mental health field

\- NOT extremely overpopulated. Again, I understand that a lot of cities are experiencing overpopulation that the infrastructure can't handle, but we want something that's kind of a ""hidden gem"". No concrete jungle-type cities.

\- balances lack of overpopulation with a little excitement

\- good coffee shops (not a requirement but I love coffee!)

\- a fun adventure for a young couple in their 20s! (we likely won't stay there after our masters' is done)

**Here are some cities we're considering, but we're open to others of course:**

\- Duluth, MN

\- Burlington, VT

\- Charleston, SC

\- Tempe, AZ

**I totally understand that no city will check all of these boxes** (especially the balance between excitement and not being overpopulated), but we're having a hard time identifying which city would be best for us.

A nameless organization offered to pay for it, and when I accepted, I started to hear things no person should ever have to hear.","Before I start, I’d like to be as transparent as possible.

Twenty years ago, I was convicted of manslaughter.

Framed by an organization that took my need and my vulnerability and twisted it to their own ends.

I can’t right my wrongs, and I know that. I’ll live with the consequences of trusting them for the rest of my life.

Now that I’m free, though, I've finally decided to put the truth of what happened to me out into the world, which boils down to this:

The organization implanted something that allowed me to hear sounds that are normally well out of reach from our perception. Sounds that the human mind wasn’t designed to withstand - an imperceptible cacophony that is occurring all around you as you read this, you just don't know it. It’s occurring around me as I write this as well, and although I can’t physically hear it, I can still *feel* it. It's faint, but I know it's there.

And once I came to understand what they did, they made sure to silence me.

\------------------

***11/01/02 - Ten days before the incident.***

*“Ready?”*

I nodded, which was only kind of a lie. I was *always* ready for this part of my week to be over, but I was never quite ready for the god-awful sensation.

Hewitt clicked the remote, and the implant in my left temple whirred to life. It always started gently. A quiet buzzing. Irritating, but only mildly so. Inevitably, however, the sound and the vibration crescendoed. What started as a soft hum grew into a furious droning, like a cicada vibrating angry verses from the inside of my skull.

I gritted my teeth and closed my eyes tight.

*Only a few more seconds.*

Finally, when I could barely tolerate it anymore, a climatic shockwave radiated from the device, causing my jaw to clack from the force. With the reverberation dissipating as it moved further down my body, the device stilled.

A sigh of relief spilled from my lips.

I opened my eyes and saw green light reflecting off of Hewitt’s thick glasses from the implant’s remote. In layman’s terms, I’d learned that meant “all good”.

Hewitt smiled, creasing his weathered cheeks.

*“The implant is primed. Let me collect my materials so we can get this show on the road.”*

The stout Italian physician shot up from his desk chair and turned to face the wooden cabinets that lined the back of his office. Despite his advanced age and bulky frame, he was still remarkably spry.

*“Thanks. By the way, I don’t think I’ll ever be ‘ready’ for that, Doc. For any of this, actually. You can probably stop asking. Save your breath, I mean.”*

As I spoke, it felt like heavy grains of sand were swimming around my molars. I swished the pebbles onto my tongue and spat them into my hand, frowning at the chalky crystals in my palm.

*“Jesus. Cracked another filling. Does the Audiology department have a P.O. box I can forward my dental bills to?”*

He chuckled weakly as he turned back towards me. The old doctor was only half-listening, now preoccupied with assembling the familiar experimental set up. Carefully, he placed a Buddha statue, a spray bottle of clear liquid, four half-foot tall metal pillars, and a capped petri dish on the desk.

Absentmindedly, I rubbed the scar above my temple. Most of the time, I just pretended like I could perceive the outline of the dime-sized implant. The delusion helped me feel in control.

But I wasn’t in control. Not completely, at least.

I shared control with the remote in Hewitt’s hand, especially when *his* part of the implant was active. The experimental portion. Suppressing the existential anxiety that came with split dominance was challenging. I wasn’t used to my sensations being a democracy.

The concession felt worth it, though. The implant restored my hearing, and Hewitt installed it free, with a single string attached: I had to play ball with these weekly sessions, testing the part of the implant that I wasn’t allowed to know anything about, per our agreement.

On the desk, the doctor was arranging the metal pillars into a small square. Once satisfied with the dimensions of the square, he’d position the statue, the spray bottle, and the petri dish into the center of it. Then, testing would finally begin.

*“So…are your other patients tolerating this thing okay?”* I asked, fishing for a few reassuring words.

The doctor looked up from his designs, pointing a brown iris and a bushy white eyebrow at me.

*“There are no other patients like you, David.”*

He paused for a moment, maintaining unbroken eye contact, as if to highlight the importance of what just came out of his mouth. Abruptly, he severed his gaze and resumed fidgeting with the metal pillars, but he continued to talk.

*“Your case, this situation, its…unique. A marriage of circumstances. When the brain infection took your hearing, any model of cochlear implant could have been used to repair it. But you couldn’t afford them, not even the cheapest one. At the exact same time, my lab was looking for an elegant solution to our own problem. A friend of a friend was aware of both of our dilemmas. You needed an implant for free, and we needed a…”*

He stopped talking mid-sentence and swiveled his head around the setup, examining it from different angles and elevations, but he made no further modifications. It seemed like everything was in its right place. Contented, he sat back down in his chair, and briefly, Hewitt was motionless. He looked either lost in his thoughts, captivated by things he’d rather not say out loud, or he was resting and not thinking about anything at all.

Either way, it took a moment for him to remember he had been explaining something to me. My confused facial expression probably sped that process along.

*“Right. We needed a…”* he trailed off, wringing his hand to convey he was searching for the correct word in English.

*“We needed an ‘operator’. Someone to tell us that the device worked like we had designed it to. I wouldn’t say this was an elegant solution, but we’re both getting something out of the deal, I suppose.”*

In the nine months since the implantation, this was by far the most Hewitt ever divulged about the deeper contents of their arrangement.

As requested, he didn’t check if I was ready this time; instead, he winked and clicked another button on the remote.

*“What do you hear?”*

Instantly, I could hear sound emanating from each of the stationary objects in the middle of the square. Nothing moved, and yet a loud, rhythmic drumming filled my ears. Despite being able to tell the noise was coming from directly in front of me, it sounded incredibly distant, too. Like it was echoing from the depths of a massive cave system before it reached me standing at the cave’s entrance.

What started a single drum eventually became a frenzied ensemble. Over only a few seconds, hundreds of drum rolls layered over each other until the chaotic pounding caused my head to throb. The Budha was grinning, but that’s not what I heard. I heard the marble figure screaming at me, its voice made of deafening thunder rather than anything recognizably human.

I cradled my temple with my palm and grimaced, shouting an answer to Hewitt’s question.

*“All three things are drumming, same as always, Doc.”*

He clicked the remote again, and like the flick of a switch, the objects became silent immediately.

*“Thank you, David. Head to the lobby, grab a book and have Annemarie make you a cup of coffee. In about an hour, I’ll call you back. We’ll repeat the procedure, I’ll deactivate the implant, and you’ll be done for the week.”*

My legs pulled my body out of the chair without a shred of hesitation. I was dying to leave the office and get some fresh air. As my hand gripped the doorknob, however, Hewitt’s words rang in my head.

*There are no other patients like you, David.*

I turned back to the doctor, who was now spraying down the statue with the unknown liquid.

“*Hewitt…you mentioned something when we first met in the hospital - about our contract. You said that, eventually, you’d be able to explain to me what we’re doing here. I know I’ve never brought it up before now. I think I used to be more scared of knowing than I was of being left in the dark, and, well…I’ve sort of been feeling the opposite way, as of late. Is that option still on the table?”*

Although he interrupted what he was doing, he didn’t meet my gaze. Instead, he kept his focus on the statue and muttered a halfhearted response.

“*I can appeal to the board. No promises, David.”*

When I returned an hour later, the objects and the pillars were in their same positions, but the Buddha had a new, glistening shine on its marble skin.

As the device activated, the horrible drumming reappeared, but only from the spray bottle and the petri dish. The statue remained eerily quiet.

Hewitt clicked the remote one last time. The implant beeped three times, and then released one last shockwave, weaker than the one that came with “priming” his part of the device. This supposedly meant the implant had completely deactivated its experimental portion. I was told the designers never intended me to experience the drumming outside a controlled setting.

*“Well, that's all for today. You have my cell phone number. I may not always be able to answer, but call me if there are any issues. Feel free to leave a message, as well.”*

He shook my hand, forced a smile, and then waved me out of his office.

As I turned to leave, my eyes fell on the gleaming statue still sitting on his desk. Although the silence better matched the figure’s smile, I couldn’t help but feel like it was still screaming, berating me for being so naïve.

I just couldn’t hear it anymore.

\------------------

Below, I’ve typed out what I can recall of the messages I left for Hewitt leading up to my inditement.

Here's what I remember:

\------------------

***11/05/02 - Six days before the incident.***

***Me:*** *Hey Hewitt. First off, everything is OK. I know I’ve never called you on your cell before, so I don’t want you to think that…I don’t want you to think there’s a big emergency or something. I mean…there kind of was, but I’m alright.*

*I was in a car accident. Drunk driver fell asleep at the wheel, swerved into traffic and I T-boned him. Not sure he walked away from the wreck…but I’m hanging in there, all things considered. Just a broken rib and a nasty concussion on my end. Banged the side of my head against the steering wheel pretty hard.*

*Still hearing everything OK, so I’m assuming the device is working fine, but I figured with the head injury…I figured you might want to know. Especially since our next appointment isn't for another week.*

***Me:*** *Got your machine again, I guess. Haven’t heard from you, so I suppose you aren’t too worried about me…or the implant. Which is good! Which is good...*

*But…uhh…maybe you should be. I am…after last night.*

*I started…hearing the drumming at home. Just little bits of it, here and there. Much quieter than usual.*

*I was sitting at my computer…and I heard it in the background of the music I was listening to. It just kind of…appeared. I’m not sure how long it was there before I noticed it. At first, I thought I was hearing things, but as I walked through my apartment, it became louder. Muffled, though. Felt like it was coming from multiple places rather than one. Eventually, I thought I tracked it to a drawer in my kitchen, but when I pulled it opened, it stopped…all of a sudden.*

*I guess it could be the concussion, but the noise is so…distinctive. An invisible jackhammer banging into invisible concrete, like I’ve told you.*

*Anyway…just call me back.*

*Oh! Before I forget, have you heard from the board? I’d…I’d really like to know what this thing does. In addition to my hearing, I mean.*

\------------------

***11/08/02 - Three days before.***

***Me:*** *Doc - where the fuck are you?*

*…sorry. Didn’t mean to lose my temper. I…I haven’t slept.*

*Can the implant…turn on by itself? I’m…I’m definitely hearing…whatever I’m being trained to hear.*

*It’s…it’s everywhere. Comes and goes at random. Or…maybe I’m just starting to hear it when I face it a certain way. My head…it feels like an antenna. If I turn my head up and to the left…it all goes away. Any other position, though, and I can hear the drumming. Like I said - everywhere. On my phone, my clothes, the walls…*

*I…I heard it inside myself, too.*

*I managed to fall asleep, but I guess I relaxed, and my muscles relaxed and…well, my head must have turned, because I could hear it again.*

*Loud as hell...from the inside of my mouth.*

*I’m not proud, but I…I kind of freaked out. Put my hands in my mouth and just…just started scraping. I…I wanted it out of me. Dug at my gums…its really bad.*

*I can’t drive, either. I mean, I can try, but I feel like I’ll just get in another wreck, trying to keep my head up and to the left while driving. And…what if it still happens? Even though my heads in the right place?*

*Please…please call me.*

\------------------

***11/10/02 - One day before.***

***Me:*** *…I’ve started to feel it all, Hewitt.*

*The drumming…it’s moving over everything. It’s* ***in*** *everything. It breaks you, and then it rebuilds you again. And now, I have only one sense, not five.*

*I don’t see, I don’t taste, smell, touch…and I certainly don’t hear. Not anymore.*

*But I feel the current.*

*I feel it writhing and pounding and slipping and fucking and expanding and consuming and living and dying over every…****goddamned****…thing.*

*It speaks to me. Not in a language or a tongue. It’s…it’s a tide. It ebbs and flows.*

*It sings wordless songs to me…and I understand, now.*

*I thought you cursed me, Hewitt. But all transitions cause pain. I mean, how do you turn a liquid into a gas?*

*You boil it. And when it bubbles its tiny pleading screams, you certainly don’t stop.*

*You turn up the heat.*

\------------------

***11/11/02 - Day of the incident***

***Me:*** *Hello?* **(shouting)**

***Hewitt:*** *David, are you at home?*

***Me:*** *Doc - oh thank God. You…you gotta help me…oh God…it’s…it’s everywhere…I’m nothing…I’m nothing…* **(shouting)**

***Hewitt:*** *Can you get to the-***(I cut him off)**

***Me:*** *Please…please make it stop. Why doesn’t it ever…why doesn’t it ever stop…* **(Crying, shouting)**

***Hewitt:*** *David, I need you to calm down.*

***Me:*** *Am I hearing death, Hewitt? Can God hear what I can hear, Doc, or are they too scared?* **(Laughing, shouting)**

***Hewitt:*** *LISTEN.* **(shouting)**

***Me:*** … **(line goes dead)**

***Hewitt:*** *You’re hearing the microscopic, David. It was all just supposed to be a novel way to test the effectiveness of anti-infectious agents. Once they stopped moving, we know the medication killed them. We stood to make a lot of money off of the technology, but we couldn't prove it worked. Not until you. You’ve…you’ve helped so many people, David…*

***Me:*** **(quietly)** *I’ve been able…able to hear, able to feel…the billions of living things…moving around…on my skin…inside me…everywhere…*

***Hewitt:*** *Don't call an ambulance, don't call the police. We're coming to pick you up.*

\------------------

I don't remember much from that night other than this conversation. I can vaguely recall Hewitt arriving at my apartment, remote in hand. He examines my head, and I'm fading in and out of consciousness.

When I fully come to, I'm lying on my couch, holding a gun I'd never seen before. A few steps away is Hewitt's corpse.

And I start crying - not out of fear or confusion, out of relief.

It's finally quiet. Silent as the grave. The endless drumming of infinite microorganisms crawling around me and within me has vanished.

Just then, my weeping is interpreted by man rounding the corner into my living room. He's well dressed with dark blue eyes, and he walks over to sit next to me, stepping over Hewitt as he does.

He introduces himself as Hewitt. Tells me the body won't be needing the name anymore, so it's his now.

*""Listen, David, we have some new terms. You can still keep the device, meaning you can keep your hearing. Its fixed now, too. You won't be hearing anything you weren't meant to hear from now until the day you die.""*

*""As with any fair deal, I have some conditions. You can't tell anyone what you heard, and you have to take the fall for the killing of the nameless body in front of you. If you do those things, you'll be safe.""*

*""Fail to abide by those conditions, and we're turning the noise back on. All of it. And we'll leave it on, up until the moment you choke on your own tongue. Not a second sooner.""*

*""Do you understand, David?""*

\------------------

I agreed to the terms then, but I've had a little change of heart. Jail gave me perspective.

You see, the punishment behind incarceration is that you lose your autonomy. That's your incentive to reform. Serve your time, play by the rules and hey, maybe we'll give you your agency back. Maybe you'll have an opportunity to own your body again.

It makes you realize that agency and autonomy are the only things that really have value in this world. Without them, you have nothing.

And what is this implant, but another jail? I've wanted to speak up for so damn long, but the threat of being subjected to the drumming again has kept me silent. Without autonomy, I'm incarcerated no matter where I go. 

Well, my priorities have changed. I'm tired of just settling for what they'll *so* generously give me. I want my goddamned agency back.

So, to the creators of the implant, consider this my resignation from our contract. In addition, I have a few choice words. I am relying on the internet to carry them to you, wherever you are.

My boyfriend works, and also claimed a 6 figure settlement from a bad accident earlier this year, so money is not an issue. 

I’ve been feeling resentment build up because it seems like he’s making no effort to help with the bills. He gives me money here and there for things like my nails, gas, coffee, random things like that, but what does he think i pay $0 for my apartment? 


It’s exhausting and it’s to the point i’m annoyed with his presence because of the resentment, it’s been festering inside of me because I don’t know how to approach the subject. We woke up this morning and I told him I had family coming over so he needed to go home (he used to roommate but with his mom and dad after accident) that was this morning, now he’s texting me asking what’s for dinner and what time should he come back over. I just want to explode. I don’t even feel like seeing him that’s how annoyed I am with the situation. I don’t know how to turn him down. 

I do love him, he’s a great partner. I just don’t get how he can be so oblivious to the fact that i’m paying for all the bills and he hasn’t even offered to help, I’d rather live alone if that’s the case? I don’t mind living with him, but I can do bad on my own if that’s the case.

I am 6 feet (38M). I was 320 going into the new year, started carnivore a few days before the new year.

I was 440 pounds a few years ago and weight on a meal plan and dropped all the way down to 260, and I remember the weight just completely melting away on that almost instantly (Opta Via).

I haven't been paying attention too much to when/how much i've been eating, kind of just listening to my body and eating. Maybe over eating a little bit. But staying very strict on what i'm eating; beef, chicken, pork (bacon!), eggs, butter, salt. THAT'S IT. Seltzer water and water (black coffee in the morning). I have not been exercising at all either. I never experienced any ""keto flu"" like symptoms either, except maybe my mood being a little bitchy?

Did I read that right? But seriously guys, punches will not be pulled. You have been warned. The prompt will make sense by the end)

The sort of people that called the Downs their home knew better than to glance twice at the odd tableau that was a small mountain of a figure making her way down The Avenue in the dead of night; a canine monstrosity balanced atop her left shoulder, blood dripping off of its shattered jaw onto the front of her raincoat.

It was a miserable night to be out and about. The steady drizzle misting its way down past broken streetlights and grimy windows meant that most businesses foolhardy enough to operate out of this particularly godforsaken sliver of Revane had long since shuttered down for the night.

Some years ago, some starry-eyed politician had tried to breath new life into the Avenue in an attempt to combat the gang presence that had begun festering in the area.

Warehouses had been repurposed into food courts, a row of fountains had been built all the way down the main thoroughfare and business licenses had been handed out like candy at a fair. The poor man had even dug into his own coffers to commission an avenue of Grafted fruit trees that blossomed every morning, and grew heavy with fruit every night. Word was, he'd hoped that they'd act as a sort of secondary draw for his little shopping utopia; sipping coffee and dunking donuts underneath the Forever Trees, and all that.

When the day came to cut the ribbon on the Avenue, the man's dismembered corpse, as well as that of his poor assistant, were found scattered and spread out all the way up and down the street.

Every headline across the city ran with the same byline; a front page spread of an uncut ribbon, dangling in the morning sun. Beneath it, the politician's severed head, posed in a grotesque facsimile of a roguish wink atop an infamous gang sign. And beneath that, in large blood-streaked letters, the words, ""WELCOME SHOPPERS!""

There had been no coming back from that. The Downs added another notch to its belt, and the Shepherds kept their territory.

The figure paused momentarily, turning her considerable bulk to look past a small mound of refuse caught in the flickering glare of a storefront sign. Old graffiti glistened in the shape of a set of lupine incisors. The mark of the Shepherds.

Dumping her cargo next to a long disused fountain, she tested the stone work's integrity with her foot. Satisfied, she sat, scrunching her nose up a little at the mild hint of urine emanating from the fountain's stagnant pool.

Angling her rain coat's hood to keep away the worst of the drizzle, she rummaged inside her coat pocket for a few seconds, before eventually pulling out a small brown bag.

Something shifted to her right.

Emerging from the gloom of the fountain, on the side shadowed by one of the blinking streetlight above, a filthy figure, seemingly emboldened by the hint of food in the offing, held out his palms in timid supplication. Scars winked at her all along his emaciated palms and forearms where the man had taken on all sorts of crude Carvings. A Bloodletter, then. Probably surviving off of the trees.

The figure grinned, an expression that rightfully sowed the first hints of doubt somewhere in the clouded vacancies that were the beggar's eyes, and fully germinated when the giant of a woman pulled down the sides of the brown bag to reveal its contents: a severed hand, with a conspicuously mouth shaped chunk missing off of its side and a tattoo on its back that mirrored the tag that'd shed spied earlier.

Panic settled in, shaving the blunt edges off of the dullness in his eyes for a moment. He watched as she raised the bag to her mouth, revealing a double row of predatory teeth, and took a bite, her gaze never leaving his face.

She chewed, her foot resting on the humongous dog's haunches.

""You're not running.""

He shook his head.

""Not used to that."" She took another bite.

Her voice didn't sound like what you'd expect. The local monsters out here, those hired by the Shepherds and the other gangs to flex their muscle and push the locals around, never knew when to stop when it came to augments. Otis; for instance, down on Meat Row, had his voice carved to make you want to piss yourself every time he so much as growled.

This one didn't sound anything like that. Rather, she sounded like voice of an athlete he'd heard promoting some kind of protein shake a lifetime ago. Lively. Almost performative.

Still chewing, she waved the hand around. ""This fucker took something that belongs to me. Came here to get it back.""

The beggar blinked at her, resisting the urge to wipe away the sticky droplets of...fluid that got on his neck and face every time she gesticulated.

She spat out a finger bone.

""Know where I can find them?""

Fifteen minutes later, Bear found herself in a dark alley, her new friend standing passively to the side as the lookout positioned therein struggled and clawed against her forearm, his face completely engulfed in the palm of her hand. Tenacious bastard was taking too long to suffocate, so with a judicious twist of her wrist, she ended his struggles and let him crumple onto the ground.

Dead Eyes stared at her as she picked up her canine cargo once more, and sniffed the air.

""That's the last of them. At least out here."" She sniffed the air some more. ""Bunch of them in there though.""

Situated at the tail end of the street, nesting in the gloom of a dozen broken streetlights, one of the refurbished warehouses pulsed with the light and sound of the sort of establishment where mistakes were made in abundance. A small crowd of individuals stood in a loose line outside its industrial sized double doors, negotiating with a pair of oversized bouncers, behind which a Carved dog-even large than the one she bore on her shoulder-stood vigil.

Bear looked down at her strange companion and grinned, her teeth glinting in the dark and stained with the evidence of her more recent meals.

""You weren't kidding. They aren't trying to hide at all.""

Dead Eyes shook his head.

""You gonna stick around and watch?""

He shook his head again.

""Aw shucks, don't be like that. Tell you what, if you wait for me right here until I'm done, whatever drops they've got stashed in there, they're yours."" She stooped a little and patted the top of his head. ""Would you like that, my junkie friend?"" She cooed. ""Would you like to break whatever's left of your tired little mind?""

Dead eyes didn't respond. But when she stepped away, he stayed where he was, staring vacantly at nothing.

""Good boy.""

Bear stepped out of the alley way.  
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Bear felt the familiar burn as her Carvings kicked into action all along her spine and gullet. Making her way down the shadowed street, she could feel herself grow in size and bulk up as she converted her food stores into muscle and mass.

It was the simplest and least subtle of her tricks, but that was OK.

The dog reacted first, ears perking and rousing off its haunches as it caught her scent. One of the guard said something in a strange accent, before the both of them began to look around.

Grabbing the dog on her shoulder by its neck to stabilize it, she laughed as both of her hearts kicked into high gear and adrenaline surged through her system. She begun to run.

Squinting through the drizzle, they caught her advance as she charged down the street. One of them barked something at the dog growling behind their back, and it rushed out to meet her.

Bear picked up her pace, a phenomenon that the couch sized dog must not have been used to, as a hint of hesitancy bled into its pace. Still, it charged at it her, legs pumping and drool slobbering, before it judged the distance close enough and leapt at her, teeth bared.

Bear felt her new tendons strain as her left foot bit into the asphalt, cratering a section of the road as she adjusted her trajectory just enough for the beast to sail just past her, but not before she twisted her head to the side and ripped out its throat with her teeth.

She didn't stop to watch where it landed as she swallowed and the Carvings in her throat got to work, flooding her with information: Three other dogs, one of them much much larger than the others, master's new cologne irritating her nose, yesterdays lunch, the taste of fear as it realized it was going to die, sleepy longing for its kennel as it reluctantly accompanied master out into the rain, the scent of a new batch of puppies...

Bear grinned at that last one. So these \*were\* the bastards that had stolen her newly adopted rescue from the pound...

The pair at the front of the warehouse wasted precious seconds panicking, as they tried to pull something out of their waistbands.

""Nope."" Bear arrived, her momentum sending not a few unfortunate members of the crowd standing outside flying, and one screaming as she fell and bore the weight of Bear's passage on her shapely back. Bear swung her cargo like a baseball bat, wielding its neck like a hilt. The first one, the one who'd yelled something at the dog, ducked in time, throwing himself down onto the ground. The second one made a wet sound as he collided with the double doors.

Bear pivoted, turning her makeshift weapon in a large arc. Turning on the balls of her feet, she brought the creature down on the man's legs. The man howled. Bear laughed.

""Your dog hated your cologne, by the way.""

She stomped and the howling stopped.

The doors to the warehouse exploded outwards as a storm of teeth and claws charged out to meet her.  
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

It took a while for the denizens schmoozing and gyrating inside the Shepherd's warehouse club to parse what the correct reaction was to a gigantic dog sailing across the dance floor like a guided missile, bearing not a few tables and bodies in its wake.

But when the even larger monstrosity that was the woman that followed in their wake, made her presence known by laughing uproariously as she strode into the club, another of the Shepherd's infamous monster dogs dangling on her barrel sized wrist as it attempted to worry it, a conclusion was arrived at.

Pandemonium broke.

Bear barely noticed the bodies streaming past her as she lifted the dog up to get a better look at it, all the while still gripping its long dead companion by its throat.

This one looked to be more or less the same body type. Did these guys have a preference for mongrels?

She spied the Carvings on its chest and the back of its head. The workmanship was actually...not that bad. Someone in these guys' payroll knew what they were on about.

Probably why they raided the pound, she thought as she casually snapped its neck and pulled it off her wrist. Almost passively, she redirected some of her stored mass into patching up the damage.

The club was emptying out quickly, and, as she looked up into the nosebleeds, she felt her hearts race as she caught a glimpse of a man with both hands on the railing. The rings on his hands looked as expensive as the bottle he held deceptively casually as he glared down at her.

The darkness behind him shifted as a truly colossal dog eclipsed the VIP area's strobing lights and rumbled a challenge. On each of its incisors, Carvings glistened.

""Who in the ever loving fuck are you?"", the man called down.

All around her, down on the dance floor, weapons bristled and knives shone. Music pulsed.

No more civilians left huh? Bear felt the heat from her spine and gullet spread in earnest.

""I'm a dog mom."" With a manic grin, she pointed whatever remained of her grisly makeshift weapon up into the balcony in a mock salute. ""And I'm here to get my girl back.""

INT. ART SUPPLY STORE – LATE AFTERNOON

*The store is cramped, fluorescent lights buzzing over shelves crammed with half-empty paint tubes and dented sketchbooks. Rickie lingers in the pastel aisle, running his thumb over a chalky blue stick. He turns the corner and freezes.*

*Corey stands by the charcoal pencils, wearing a faded band tee and a hesitant smile. His sketchbook peeks out of his backpack, edges frayed. Their eyes meet. Rickie’s breath hitches audibly. He fumbles the pastel, sending it clattering to the floor. A beat of stunned silence.*

COREY

(too casual)

Hey. Uh. Rickie, right?

RICKIE

(stiffening, voice strained)

You here?

*He crouches to grab the fallen pastel, avoiding Corey’s gaze. When he stands, his arms cross tightly over his chest.*

COREY

(scratching his neck)

Just… hiding from my stepdad’s new ”no art supplies til your grades improve” policy.

RICKIE

(too fast, defensive)

Tell him art is a grade. Unless you’re in woodshop.
*His attempt at sarcasm falters. Corey grins, oblivious to Rickie’s internal meltdown.*

*Corey flips his sketchbook around, revealing a mural design: a sunburst colliding with storm clouds.*

COREY

School project. Principal wants something ”uplifting.”

*Rickie leans in despite himself, forgetting to guard his expression. His voice softens, almost to himself:*

RICKIE

You’re using the wrong blue.

COREY

(blinks)

What?

*Rickie plucks a Prussian blue pastel from the rack, holding it out like an accusation.*

RICKIE

For the shadows. That cerulean crap is too… (waves a hand) …Hallmark card.

COREY

(staring at him)

You’ve got a good eye. I’ve seen your stuff around.

*Rickie freezes. His throat bobs. He snaps the pastel in his hand, blue dust coating his fingers.*

RICKIE

(bitter laugh)

Yeah, well. Not like anyone notices.

COREY

(stepping closer)

I did.

*Rickie steps back, bumping into a shelf. A tube of cadmium red crashes to the floor. Corey doesn’t flinch.*

COREY (CONT’D)

(rushing)

I’m supposed to finish this mural by Friday. But it’s… missing something. You wanna help?

RICKIE

(voice shaky)

What, like a pity collab?

COREY

(firm)

Like a partner.

*Rickie stares, throat tight. Corey’s eyes flick to his lips. The air crackles. Rickie’s hands tremble as he grabs a cheap brush, twirling it like a baton to mask the panic.*

RICKIE

Only if we add a hidden middle finger in the clouds.

COREY

(grinning)

Deal.

*Their hands brush reaching for the same pastel. Rickie jerks back like he’s been burned. Corey hesitates—then kisses him, quick and off-center. Rickie’s eyes fly wide, his whole body rigid. Corey pulls back, panicked.*

COREY

Shit. I’m—I didn’t—

RICKIE

(cutting him off, desperate)

You missed.

*He yanks Corey closer, kissing him properly—fierce, hungry, years of buried longing surging to the surface. They break apart, breathless. A jar of gesso tips over, pooling white onto the floor.*

COREY

(dazed)

…So, Friday?

RICKIE

(adjusting his jacket, voice trembling)

Bring better blue.

*He bolts for the door, pausing just once to press shaking fingertips to his lips.*

RICKIE (V.O.)

Art stores smell like hope and turpentine. And I’m deathly allergic to both.

INT. LIBERTY HIGH SCHOOL – EMPTY CLASSROOM – AFTERNOON

*The room feels too big, sunlight bleeding through grimy windows. Angela perches on the edge of a desk, her knees pulled to her chest. Brian lingers near the door, shoulders tense, clutching his backpack like a life raft. The crumpled apology letter (signed “Jordan”) rests between them like a landmine.*

ANGELA (V.O.)

Words are supposed to make things clearer. But these ones? They just… float. Like dust. And I can’t stop breathing them in.

BRIAN

(stiffly)

You wanted to talk.

*Not a question. Angela nods at the letter. Her voice wavers.*

ANGELA

Why’d you do it?

BRIAN

(defensive)

He asked me to—

ANGELA

(soft, cutting him off)

No. Why’d **you** do it?

*Brian stares at the floor. A beat. His voice cracks.*

BRIAN

Because you looked at him like… like he hung the moon. And he didn’t even see it.

*Angela’s breath hitches. She slides off the desk, tentative. Brian doesn’t move.*

ANGELA

(whispering)

These aren’t his words, Brian. They’re yours.

BRIAN

(bitter laugh)

Yeah. But you wanted them to be his.

*Angela steps closer, tears glinting. Brian’s hands tremble. The air thickens.*

ANGELA (V.O.)

Brian Krakow’s always right there. In the margins. And I’m just… now noticing the handwriting.

*She kisses him—sudden, searching. Brian freezes, a strangled sound escaping his throat. His fingers clutch her sweater, knuckles white. A stifled gasp. His hips jerk forward involuntarily. He breaks away, mortified, backing into a desk. His face burns crimson.*

BRIAN

(choked)

I—I’m sorry. It’s… not—

ANGELA

(blushing, confused)

…What?

*Brian fumbles for words, eyes darting to his jeans. Angela follows his gaze. Realization dawns. She covers her mouth, half-laughing, half-horrified.*

ANGELA (CONT’D)

Oh. Oh my God.

BRIAN

(muffled, hands over face)

It’s not—I didn’t—

*Angela’s laugh softens. She touches his arm, gentle.*

ANGELA

It’s… okay.

BRIAN

(peeking through fingers)

It’s not.

*They stand in stunned silence. The bell rings. Brian grabs his backpack, holding it awkwardly in front of him.*

ANGELA (V.O.)

Truth isn’t a letter. Or a kiss. It’s… this. Whatever this is.

*She hands him her sweatshirt without a word. He takes it, grimacing.*

BRIAN

(muttering)

I’ll… wash it.

*Angela smiles faintly, lingering in the doorway.*

ANGELA

Just… don’t lie anymore, okay?

*Brian nods, eyes raw. She leaves. He sinks into a chair, pressing the letter to his forehead.*

BRIAN (V.O.)

Note to self: Never wear khakis again.

\[FADE OUT.\]

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INT. RESTAURANT SPACE – AFTERNOON

*The hollow shell of the future restaurant feels cavernous, sunlight slicing through plastic-covered windows. Dust motes swirl around Graham, hunched over blueprints on a sawhorse table. A coffee-stained thermos sits abandoned. He mutters under his breath, jabbing at the blueprint with his pencil. The measurements don’t add up—a column misplaced by six inches. He rubs his temples, stress lines deepening.*

*The door creaks open—Hallie strides in, her heels echoing too loudly. She holds a grease-spotted paper bag.*

HALLIE

(forced brightness)

I brought egg rolls. The kind with that… (snaps fingers) …weird pink sauce you like.

*Graham doesn’t look up. His pencil grinds into the blueprint margin.*

GRAHAM

(distracted)

Thanks. Just set it there.

*Hallie hesitates, then drops the bag. Silence, except for Graham’s scribbling. She picks at her nail polish.*

HALLIE

(too casual)

Patty called me. About the… uh… ventilation specs. City needs ’em for the final inspection.

*Graham’s pencil stops. Beat. He finally meets her eyes.*

GRAHAM

She didn’t mention it to me.

HALLIE

(shrugs)

She called the restaurant line. The one I set up. (Forces a laugh.) You really need to get a landline in here, Graham.

*Graham stares at her, jaw tight. Hallie’s smile fades. The subtext hangs heavy—Patty’s distance, Graham’s absence. Hallie kicks a loose tile.*

HALLIE (CONT’D)

(softly)

You sleeping in that office again?

GRAHAM

(sharp)

It’s not an office. It’s—

HALLIE

(cuts him off)

a storage closet. With a sleeping bag. And a hot plate. (Pauses.) I saw the receipts.

*Graham sighs, rubbing his neck. The blueprints crinkle as he sits on the floor, gesturing for her to join. She does, skirts pooling around her. They eat in silence, the egg rolls sitting heavy in their stomachs.*

HALLIE

(quiet)

I had this dream last night. We were… open. Packed. You were laughing. (Pauses.) Patty wasn’t there.

*Graham stares at her. Hallie’s facade cracks—a flicker of want, sharp and desperate. She leans in. He doesn’t pull back.*

GRAHAM (V.O.)

When you’re starving, even guilt tastes like food.

*Their kiss is clumsy—all teeth and noses. Hallie’s hand grips his collar; Graham’s fingers leave flourishes on her wrist. They break apart, breathing ragged. Hallie scrambles up, lipstick smeared.*

HALLIE

(panicked laugh)

Shit. Shit.

GRAHAM

(hoarse)

Hallie—

*She’s already at the door, pausing just once. Her reflection fractures in the plastic-covered window.*

HALLIE

Tell Patty I… I’ll email the specs.

*Graham sits alone, egg roll grease seeping into the blueprint—right over the kitchen design. He balls it up, hurls it at the wall.*

GRAHAM (V.O.)

Some blueprints aren’t worth saving.

Height: 5'6

According to my phone my resting energy is average 1400 cals and the energy i burn is average 200 cals (I walk 7-9k every day)

According to that my maintenance is around 1600 calories, but if i write my information into a TDEE calculator it says it's around 1900 (i put in light exercise)

How do i know which one is right? 

Im trying to get ready to maintain since i only have 4lbs to lose, but it's confusing me. I don't wanna lose weight once im at my goal weight, and 1600 calories seems pretty low to me for my height and age. 

Im on my feet all day, even when im not walking around i just like to stand for no reason and just be on my phone and do stuff (i get fidgety pretty quickly when im laying down lol so that's why standing is better for me) 

Even tho 1600 cals is still a lot and i can easily be full for a whole day from two bigger meals, i still want my snacks and coffee here and there.

I know there's First Friday, and some art fair sections of the Farmer's Market, but those are more about having a dedeicated studio or booth for people to visit. 

Should I put together a portfolio and just visit places? Email places? idk why I feel so unsure about this. I guess I assume there's a whole network of artists through Western that have their own clubs and opportunities. I did not attend Western and have no idea what the students are up to.

So like most of you I've been having a shitty time recently. But I've had a couple of really nice moments that made me emotional.

First, I made a new friend online. We spent a couple of weeks chatting and getting to know each other before meeting in person. She's great and I'm really happy to have found her. I told her that I was trans after talking for a week or so, and she was so kind and affirming. Told me that I didn't need to worry and that she would support me. Then we met up a few days ago for dinner and had a really nice time together. She called me beautiful multiple times, and I felt seen as a woman the whole time. We're definitely going to hang out more in the future.

Then yesterday I went out for coffee with another new friend/potential romantic interest. It felt really natural and comfortable talking together. She's also great and again, I felt seen as a woman the whole time. She told me she liked my makeup, which was nice to hear because I've really been working on getting better at it recently. I also told her a story about a time years ago when a gay man was hitting on me, and she had to take a minute to process why a gay man would be interested in me. Because she just saw me as a woman and she doesn't have the image in her head of what I looked like before I started transitioning. She knows I'm trans, but just wasn't thinking about it in that moment, I guess. Then today, she texted me and asked me out on a date! I'm excited for it. 

I just wanted to share the good feelings. I'm a little emotional about it right now.

Also, if you're reading this and you're thinking about transitioning but you're worried about starting too late, just know that the possibilities are so much greater than you probably think right now. I thought a year ago that there was no way I could ever be perceived as a woman, but the corner has been turned and now I think that really is how people see me most of the time.",1,1738618721.0,MtF,0,1.0,False

1ih0riu,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualPT/comments/1ih0riu/mais_um_desabafo/,Mais um desabafo...,"Bem cá estou eu de novo. A vir ao Reddit pedir conselhos e opiniões em vez de marcar outra consulta com a psicóloga.

Uns updates em relação aos meus posts anteriores aqui no subreddit:
-Estou empregado e efetivo nos quadros do estado, larguei o trabalho no café e avancei para a carreira de professor e tem sido uma experiência muito interessante, com os seus altos e baixos.
-Estou solteiro, a mulher que eu achava que me ia acompanhar para o resto da minha vida, decidiu que eu era melhor amigo do que namorado e deixou-me.
-Estou ""sem casa"", após o divórcio dos meus pais e da venda da nossa casa de família fui meio que forçado a vir viver com a minha avó materna.

O desabafo que estou prestes a escrever deriva disto tudo.

Ultimamente sinto me péssimo, sinto que sempre que as coisas parecem estar a melhorar, pioram dez vezes mais. Vou fazer isto por secções/tópicos porque é a única forma que eu sinto que consigo organizar os meus pensamentos melhor.

-A vida social/Romântica:
Tenho um pequeno grupo de amigos e não os trocava por nada, mas agora quase não tenho tempo para os ver e para sair com eles, gostava de o fazer mas tudo o que tem acontecido tem dificultado essa possibilidade. Quero fazer novas amizades e conhecer novas pessoas mas parece que cada-vez se torna mais difícil fazê-lo. Perdoem me o pensamento Pessoano mas porque é que não poderia ser tudo como na nossa infância, dizíamos ""agora somos amigos"" e ficávamos amigos para a vida, muitas das minhas amizades são isso. Soou ingrato com as amizades que tenho, eu sei, mas com a quantidade coisas que tenho lidado com alguns deles, ando de pé atrás...

Depois vem o romance, perdi o que a minha psicóloga categorizou como ""O meu primeiro amor"", temos namoricos, paixões, e amores e ela foi o meu primeiro amor. Nós já tinhamos tido uns problemas no passado que com melhor comunicação podiam ter sido resolvidos e o que a levou a decidir que já não queria estar comigo foi novamente um problema que tinha solução. Agora, um mês e meio depois, cá estou eu de novo solteiro, ainda a sonhar com ela e a imaginar o que poderia ter sido e o que já foi, a pensar que ela já cagou em mim e ainda estou eu aqui a sofrer. Depois parece que todas as tentativas que faço para tentar esquecer, seja terapia, seja sair com outras pessoas casualmente (que não acontece porque parece que ninguém olha pra mim e pensa ""yah o gajo é bacano, até é giro, bora falar com ele"") não dão em nada.

Tenho 22 e sinto que perdi o tempo de ir para as discotecas curtir com pessoas à toa, apanhar altas bebedeiras e divertir-me, qualquer nova amizade ou pessoa pela qualganhe interesse romântico parece ser cada vez mais difícil de manter por perto.

-O trabalho:
Larguei o meu trabalho part-time na Copenhagen Coffee Labs (e ainda bem que sim, aquilo anda um caos pelo que ando a ouvir) e avancei para a carreira de professor, comecei em setembro como professor de Português e Inglês para miúdos de 5° e 6° ano e Diretor de turma de 6°.

 Não vou mentir, é um trabalho fixe, mas tem os seus altos e baixos. No primeiro período correu tudo bem, agora no segundo... Já houve uma luta entre duas miúdas, uma delas da minha direção de turma, que levou às suas respectivas suspensões, a carga de trabalho não letivo anda a encher as mãos de todos os professores e as minhas especialmente, por causa da belíssima ideia que alguém teve de passar os exames/provas de aferição para formato digital (qual era o problema dos exames em papél?????), tenho dois miúdos em risco de suspensão por excesso de faltas disciplinares, uns que já vamos ter que notificar a CPCJ por grande número de ausências injustificadas e pronto, é uma carga de trabalho tremenda que me tem deixado numa pilha de nervos. Agora estou efetivo, foi uma conquista muito favorecida pela sorte mas uma conquista de qualquer forma. Os meus colegas tem sido, na maioria, impecáveis e têm me ajudado muito no que toca à gestão de sala de aula, mas estes miúdos estão cada vez mais impossíveis, puseram me logo como Diretor de Turma de um das piores, se não a pior, turma de 6° ano da escola. Não tenho queixas das minhas outras turmas, adoro os miúdos, são simpáticos, empenhados e o futuro deles promete.

-Habitação:
Esta, por fim, porque este desabafo já se alonga demasiado, a questão da habitação. Desde outubro que estou a viver na casa da minha avó, que após a venda da minha casa de infância, depois do divórcio dos meus pais e desde então que tem sido uma luta para encontrar casa para habitação própria. A efetividade ajudou me bastante com os valores que o banco me dá, juntando a isso a garantia jovem parecia que ia ter tudo resolvido em breve mas não. Os bancos não me deram valores decentes e as avaliações das casas na margem sul não andam favoráveis para os valores que os proprietários querem pelas casas ( e uma vez que os bancos só emprestam o valor resultante da avaliação, isso deixa-me sem grandes opções.) Felizmente já tenho a parte do empréstimo tratada mas encontrar uma casa cuja avaliação seja boa, habitável e bem localizada....aí já é difícil...

E tem sido stress atrás de stress atrás de stress ultimamente, eu sei que a malta mais velha provavelmente vai olhar para este posto e vai ridícularizar ou o conteúdo do post ou o meu português ou os parágrafos como de costume mas eu só procuro umas palavras sabias que me possam ajudar, algum apoio, alguém em situações semelhantes que possa partilhar comigo o seu ponto de vista...
Sinto me só, cansado e desmotivado...

É isso...

We ended up doing the following: 

Thursday - arrive late, local bus into town (very cheap), met our Airbnb host and walked her dog with her. Stayed up chatting before getting some rest. 

Friday - town in the morning. Bruktbokhandle and general mooch about. Pust sauna for two hours with plenty jumps in the ocean. Loved that. Then quick polar museum. Meh. Healthy Asian Foods for dinner, decent and not so expensive. A couple of pints and midnight concert in the cathedral; that I wouldn't really reccomend. 

Saturday - up and at it. Grabbed coffee then a bus across the bridge. Walked from the arctic cathedral up Sherpatrappen to the top of the cable car. We had heard the conditions would be impossible and horrific, but we found it fine. Sure, my £10 Amazon crampons were probably put to the test, but we made it to the top pretty easily in less than 2 hours. We then slid down on our bums which was probably a highlight of the trip. Walk to Arctic cathedral again, across bridge, pizza for dinner, jobs a gooden. Then back out for a pint and some cards, on the way to which we saw the northern lights.

Sunday - after breakfast with our Airbnb host, she reccomended we visit the University Museum and southern tip of the island, to answer some of our queries about Sami culture. In my research before visiting, this play wasn't much talked about, but the museum was fantastic, and the Pier am Folkeparken was a ridiculous view. Hard reccomend. After some souveineir shopping and a reindeer hot dog, we were back on a local bus up to the airport. 

  
We had been warned lots about trying to do Tromso cheaply and without tours, and I believe we proved those people absolutely wrong. **Without spending a fortune**, we had a fantastic time and Tromso is probably my favourite place I've visited in Europe. See the beauty of Tromso is (obviously) all natural. So whilst I can see the merit in forking out on a northern lights, or reindeer, or whale watching tour, none of these are mandatory! Walk around the island, do hikes, visit museums! Sure we splashed a little on Pust, but beyond this we really didn't spend too much, beyond one sit down meal a day (otherwise eating from supermarkets etc.) Please don't be put down by being told/believing you HAVE to do so many expensive things to enjoy Tromso, its simply not true. 

  
Our trip was also in large part made by our Airbnb host. On my original thread, there was some backlast about the tourist and Airbnb industry in Tromso. Our host was extremely hospitable, and discussed these problems with us. She already rents out two rooms in her home to students, and the room used for Airbnb would be spare otherwise, meaning it is not affecting local rents. She shared fears over the industry and its effects, and its certainly an interesting topic. She was fantastic, giving us reccomendations, and spending hours having interesting conversations with us. If anybody is looking for a central host who will offer a homely experience, I'd be glad to reccomend.

I’m launching my **mushroom coffee** campaign next Tuesday and have been testing different ways to promote my **Kickstarter pre-launch page**, but the results have been limited. Here’s what I’ve tried so far:

* **FB Ads ($10/day, CPV model)** – Trying to build an audience to retarget on launch day, but engagement is low. Getting views, but no real followers.
* **Posting in Coffee/F&B-Related FB Groups** – Most groups seem inactive, so the impact is questionable.

Since I’m in the **food & beverage space**, I’d love to hear from anyone who has **successfully launched an F&B product on Kickstarter**. What worked best for you? Any **organic or paid strategies** that helped drive engagement and sign-ups before launch?

Of course feel free to change up the names to your liking.

100g 15 suiker, 50g 9 zout, IBU 8g 20

# - Softner

The most basic recipe i use in a lot of things is **Softner**. These materials can be acquired at the **gas station**. 

It consists of : **50% Sugar**, **50% Salt**.

The easiest way is to make **100 grams** of **Softner**, this will cost you ***$16,50.***

# - Amphetamine

I use two types of Amphetamine, **AMP80** and **AMP80+.**

The only real difference between these two is the fact that **AMP80+** is more addictive, use this when selling to people expecting **higher quality** or people you want to get **addicted**.

**AMP80** : **78% Amphetamine, 22% Softner.** Crafting **10 grams** will cost you ***$58,23***

**AMP80+ : 78% Amphetamine, 19% Softner, 3% Ibuprofen.** Crafting **10 grams** will cost you ***$57,82***

# - Ecstasy

This one is for people that have gotten a little further into the game, for doing this more efficient i recommend getting a **pill machine** (of course), **electric coffee mill** and a **mixer.**

**XTC80 : 78% Ecstasy, 22% Softner.** Crafting **10 grams** will cost you ***$58,23***



# - Cocaine

This one is also for people that have gotten a little further into the game. Pretty **addictive** by itself, no need to mix it up with **Ibuprofen** or **Viagra**. If you do want to **make it more addictive**, choose **Viagra** because of its **high addictiveness rate** and **low toxicity**.

**SNOW75 : 74% Cocaine, 7% Ecstasy (pure), 19% Softner.** Crafting **10 grams** will cost you ***$189,92***



# - Heroin

This one is also for people that have gotten a little further into the game.

**HERO80 : 76% Heroin, 24% Softner.** Crafting **10 grams** will cost you ***$129,40***

  
As you can probably tell i like to use the **Softner** a lot in all the mixes, it is pretty easy to get and make and it keeps the cost low. **Mixing** your drugs always results in a **higher yield** and so results in **more profit**.

I also tried Caraval but i just could not get into it 😭. It was clean, but just kinda weird and boring for me. Garber's writing style is just not for me i guess. Also there were too many detailed descriptions of every dress the main character wore. 

I also tried If We Were Villains and i expected to love it because of the concept (it's like A Secret History but with theatre kids) but all of the characters were insufferable and 70% of the dialogue was just random Shakespeare quotes. And it seemed likt the author was trying to push the ""dark academia"" vibes a bit too hard.

(Reminder that my mini rant is just my opinion and if you enjoyed the two books above, that's great!! :D | i can definitely see why people like them.)

1ih0hae,https://www.reddit.com/r/Commodities/comments/1ih0hae/advice_to_a_young_trader/,Advice to a young trader,"Hello! I'm not active on this sub (or reddit in general), but recently I started reading this sub and found it very helpful as it feels sometimes too hard to find material and places to share experience, thoughts and advice about commodity trading.

Anyway, I'm Brazilian, M and started a coffee trading company in 2017 in Brazil. My cousin was a local merchant of Arabica and the idea was to make the trading more professional, find better margins abroad, etc. Starting from nothing, the company has developed but it is small in the scheme of things: in 2024 we had 40M USD revenue with 1,5M in earnings. We've also started trading Robusta coffee and black pepper, have our own sorting facilities and warehouse and managed to recover from small losses in the first years.

The business feels more stable than ever, but I am still struggling with a couple of issues:

1.	⁠I feel very pressured all the time with the bulk of decision making and general management focused on me - my cousin left the company in 2020 to retire (he was 65). We got ~20 employees, 10 in warehouse, 5 in finance and 5 in quality/purchasing, one junior trader who really helps me and grew up with the company. The pool of talent where we are based (countryside of Brazil) is not the best if I wanted to hire a more senior manager, and bigger trading houses (Olam, LDC, NKG) are able to pay way much more than me to convince them to move. In the end, I feel like general manager + solo trader of 2 product, which has been feeling unsustainable;
2.	⁠Although I feel our risk management and decision making are good, sometimes the amount of risk involved feels too big to handle. We don't have loads of resources to spend on systems, and with the volatility in soft commodities, everything feels like a huge balloon of market and counterparty risk ready to pop. That sentiment is probably magnified by (1). Related to this, I often feel like exploring new things/thinking outside the box, had a few ideas for the company, but always end up focusing on what we call in Brazil ""rice and beans"", that is, the very basic trading that started exciting, but is now boring, but pays it pays the bills;
3.	⁠I am about to marry a british woman. We live in Brazil now, but are likely to relocate to the UK. I've spent half of my time in the past 2 years in London, and to prepare for the scenario in which we live there, I've opened a small importing operation to trade a wee bit of specialty coffee locally, which was a relative success in 2024 and I'd be happy to expand. I could also try to apply for a trading company, knowing London is a good place for it - and I really don't mind working with coffee, trading is what I love - but then many times I feel like it's too late for that, or that I am not capable of it. Anyway, the truth is that the benefits of just staying focused on my company are potentially good, but so is the pressure and instability (see (1) and (2)).

I know there is no right answer or divine thought that will solve my doubts, but would be lovely it you could share your opinion on all this.

A nameless organization offered to pay for it, and when I accepted, I started to hear things no person should ever have to hear.","Before I start, I’d like to be as transparent as possible.

Twenty years ago, I was convicted of manslaughter. 

Framed by an organization that took my need and my vulnerability and twisted it to their own ends.

I can’t right my wrongs, and I know that. I’ll live with the consequences of trusting them for the rest of my life. 

Now that I’m free, though, I've finally decided to put the truth of what happened to me out into the world, which boils down to this:

The organization implanted something that allowed me to hear sounds that are normally well out of reach from our perception. Sounds that the human mind wasn’t designed to withstand - an imperceptible cacophony that is occurring all around you as you read this, you just don't know it. It’s occurring around me as I write this as well, and although I can’t physically hear it, I can still *feel* it. It's faint, but I know it's there. 

And once I came to understand what they did, they made sure to silence me. 

\------------------

***11/01/02 - Ten days before the incident.*** 

*“Ready?”*

I nodded, which was only kind of a lie. I was *always* ready for this part of my week to be over, but I was never quite ready for the god-awful sensation.

Hewitt clicked the remote, and the implant in my left temple whirred to life. It always started gently. A quiet buzzing. Irritating, but only mildly so. Inevitably, however, the sound and the vibration crescendoed. What started as a soft hum grew into a furious droning, like a cicada vibrating angry verses from the inside of my skull.

I gritted my teeth and closed my eyes tight.

*Only a few more seconds.*

Finally, when I could barely tolerate it anymore, a climatic shockwave radiated from the device, causing my jaw to clack from the force. With the reverberation dissipating as it moved further down my body, the device stilled.

A sigh of relief spilled from my lips.

I opened my eyes and saw green light reflecting off of Hewitt’s thick glasses from the implant’s remote. In layman’s terms, I’d learned that meant “all good”.

Hewitt smiled, creasing his weathered cheeks.

*“The implant is primed. Let me collect my materials so we can get this show on the road.”*

The stout Italian physician shot up from his desk chair and turned to face the wooden cabinets that lined the back of his office. Despite his advanced age and bulky frame, he was still remarkably spry.

*“Thanks. By the way, I don’t think I’ll ever be ‘ready’ for that, Doc. For any of this, actually. You can probably stop asking. Save your breath, I mean.”*

As I spoke, it felt like heavy grains of sand were swimming around my molars. I swished the pebbles onto my tongue and spat them into my hand, frowning at the chalky crystals in my palm.

*“Jesus. Cracked another filling. Does the Audiology department have a P.O. box I can forward my dental bills to?”*

He chuckled weakly as he turned back towards me. The old doctor was only half-listening, now preoccupied with assembling the familiar experimental set up. Carefully, he placed a Buddha statue, a spray bottle of clear liquid, four half-foot tall metal pillars, and a capped petri dish on the desk.

Absentmindedly, I rubbed the scar above my temple. Most of the time, I just pretended like I could perceive the outline of the dime-sized implant. The delusion helped me feel in control.

But I wasn’t in control. Not completely, at least. 

I shared control with the remote in Hewitt’s hand, especially when *his* part of the implant was active. The experimental portion. Suppressing the existential anxiety that came with split dominance was challenging. I wasn’t used to my sensations being a democracy.

The concession felt worth it, though. The implant restored my hearing, and Hewitt installed it free, with a single string attached: I had to play ball with these weekly sessions, testing the part of the implant that I wasn’t allowed to know anything about, per our agreement.

On the desk, the doctor was arranging the metal pillars into a small square. Once satisfied with the dimensions of the square, he’d position the statue, the spray bottle, and the petri dish into the center of it. Then, testing would finally begin.

*“So…are your other patients tolerating this thing okay?”* I asked, fishing for a few reassuring words.

The doctor looked up from his designs, pointing a brown iris and a bushy white eyebrow at me.

*“There are no other patients like you, David.”*

He paused for a moment, maintaining unbroken eye contact, as if to highlight the importance of what just came out of his mouth. Abruptly, he severed his gaze and resumed fidgeting with the metal pillars, but he continued to talk.

*“Your case, this situation, its…unique. A marriage of circumstances. When the brain infection took your hearing, any model of cochlear implant could have been used to repair it. But you couldn’t afford them, not even the cheapest one. At the exact same time, my lab was looking for an elegant solution to our own problem. A friend of a friend was aware of both of our dilemmas. You needed an implant for free, and we needed a…”*

He stopped talking mid-sentence and swiveled his head around the setup, examining it from different angles and elevations, but he made no further modifications. It seemed like everything was in its right place. Contented, he sat back down in his chair, and briefly, Hewitt was motionless. He looked either lost in his thoughts, captivated by things he’d rather not say out loud, or he was resting and not thinking about anything at all.

Either way, it took a moment for him to remember he had been explaining something to me. My confused facial expression probably sped that process along.

*“Right. We needed a…”* he trailed off, wringing his hand to convey he was searching for the correct word in English.

*“We needed an ‘operator’. Someone to tell us that the device worked like we had designed it to. I wouldn’t say this was an elegant solution, but we’re both getting something out of the deal, I suppose.”*

In the nine months since the implantation, this was by far the most Hewitt ever divulged about the deeper contents of their arrangement.

As requested, he didn’t check if I was ready this time; instead, he winked and clicked another button on the remote.

*“What do you hear?”*

Instantly, I could hear sound emanating from each of the stationary objects in the middle of the square. Nothing moved, and yet a loud, rhythmic drumming filled my ears. Despite being able to tell the noise was coming from directly in front of me, it sounded incredibly distant, too. Like it was echoing from the depths of a massive cave system before it reached me standing at the cave’s entrance.

What started a single drum eventually became a frenzied ensemble. Over only a few seconds, hundreds of drum rolls layered over each other until the chaotic pounding caused my head to throb. The Budha was grinning, but that’s not what I heard. I heard the marble figure screaming at me, its voice made of deafening thunder rather than anything recognizably human.

I cradled my temple with my palm and grimaced, shouting an answer to Hewitt’s question.

*“All three things are drumming, same as always, Doc.”*

He clicked the remote again, and like the flick of a switch, the objects became silent immediately. 

*“Thank you, David. Head to the lobby, grab a book and have Annemarie make you a cup of coffee. In about an hour, I’ll call you back. We’ll repeat the procedure, I’ll deactivate the implant, and you’ll be done for the week.”*

My legs pulled my body out of the chair without a shred of hesitation. I was dying to leave the office and get some fresh air. As my hand gripped the doorknob, however, Hewitt’s words rang in my head.

*There are no other patients like you, David.*

I turned back to the doctor, who was now spraying down the statue with the unknown liquid.

“*Hewitt…you mentioned something when we first met in the hospital - about our contract. You said that, eventually, you’d be able to explain to me what we’re doing here. I know I’ve never brought it up before now. I think I used to be more scared of knowing than I was of being left in the dark, and, well…I’ve sort of been feeling the opposite way, as of late. Is that option still on the table?”*

Although he interrupted what he was doing, he didn’t meet my gaze. Instead, he kept his focus on the statue and muttered a halfhearted response.

“*I can appeal to the board. No promises, David.”*

When I returned an hour later, the objects and the pillars were in their same positions, but the Buddha had a new, glistening shine on its marble skin.

As the device activated, the horrible drumming reappeared, but only from the spray bottle and the petri dish. The statue remained eerily quiet. 

Hewitt clicked the remote one last time. The implant beeped three times, and then released one last shockwave, weaker than the one that came with “priming” his part of the device. This supposedly meant the implant had completely deactivated its experimental portion. I was told the designers never intended me to experience the drumming outside a controlled setting.

*“Well, that's all for today. You have my cell phone number. I may not always be able to answer, but call me if there are any issues. Feel free to leave a message, as well.”*

He shook my hand, forced a smile, and then waved me out of his office.

As I turned to leave, my eyes fell on the gleaming statue still sitting on his desk. Although the silence better matched the figure’s smile, I couldn’t help but feel like it was still screaming, berating me for being so naïve.

I just couldn’t hear it anymore.

\------------------

Below, I’ve typed out what I can recall of the messages I left for Hewitt leading up to my inditement. 

Here's what I remember: 

\------------------

***11/05/02 - Six days before the incident.***

***Me:*** *Hey Hewitt. First off, everything is OK. I know I’ve never called you on your cell before, so I don’t want you to think that…I don’t want you to think there’s a big emergency or something. I mean…there kind of was, but I’m alright.*

*I was in a car accident. Drunk driver fell asleep at the wheel, swerved into traffic and I T-boned him. Not sure he walked away from the wreck…but I’m hanging in there, all things considered. Just a broken rib and a nasty concussion on my end. Banged the side of my head against the steering wheel pretty hard.*

*Still hearing everything OK, so I’m assuming the device is working fine, but I figured with the head injury…I figured you might want to know. Especially since our next appointment isn't for another week.*

*Give me a call back at* \[xxx-xxx-xxxx\] *when you can.*

\------------------

***11/06/02 - Five days before.***

***Me:*** *Got your machine again, I guess. Haven’t heard from you, so I suppose you aren’t too worried about me…or the implant. Which is good! Which is good...*

*But…uhh…maybe you should be. I am…after last night.*

*I started…hearing the drumming at home. Just little bits of it, here and there. Much quieter than usual.* 

*I was sitting at my computer…and I heard it in the background of the music I was listening to. It just kind of…appeared. I’m not sure how long it was there before I noticed it. At first, I thought I was hearing things, but as I walked through my apartment, it became louder. Muffled, though. Felt like it was coming from multiple places rather than one. Eventually, I thought I tracked it to a drawer in my kitchen, but when I pulled it opened, it stopped…all of a sudden.*

*I guess it could be the concussion, but the noise is so…distinctive. An invisible jackhammer banging into invisible concrete, like I’ve told you.*

*Anyway…just call me back.*

*Oh! Before I forget, have you heard from the board? I’d…I’d really like to know what this thing does. In addition to my hearing, I mean.*

\------------------

***11/08/02 - Three days before.***

***Me:*** *Doc - where the fuck are you?*

*…sorry. Didn’t mean to lose my temper. I…I haven’t slept.*

*Can the implant…turn on by itself? I’m…I’m definitely hearing…whatever I’m being trained to hear.*

*It’s…it’s everywhere. Comes and goes at random. Or…maybe I’m just starting to hear it when I face it a certain way. My head…it feels like an antenna. If I turn my head up and to the left…it all goes away. Any other position, though, and I can hear the drumming. Like I said - everywhere. On my phone, my clothes, the walls…*

*I…I heard it inside myself, too.*

*I managed to fall asleep, but I guess I relaxed, and my muscles relaxed and…well, my head must have turned, because I could hear it again.* 

*Loud as hell...from the inside of my mouth.* 

*I’m not proud, but I…I kind of freaked out. Put my hands in my mouth and just…just started scraping. I…I wanted it out of me. Dug at my gums…its really bad.*

*I can’t drive, either. I mean, I can try, but I feel like I’ll just get in another wreck, trying to keep my head up and to the left while driving. And…what if it still happens? Even though my heads in the right place?*

*Please…please call me.*

\------------------

***11/10/02 - One day before.***

***Me:*** *…I’ve started to feel it all, Hewitt.*

*The drumming…it’s moving over everything. It’s* ***in*** *everything. It breaks you, and then it rebuilds you again. And now, I have only one sense, not five.*

*I don’t see, I don’t taste, smell, touch…and I certainly don’t hear. Not anymore.*

*But I feel the current.* 

*I feel it writhing and pounding and slipping and fucking and expanding and consuming and living and dying over every…****goddamned****…thing.*

*It speaks to me. Not in a language or a tongue. It’s…it’s a tide. It ebbs and flows.*

*It sings wordless songs to me…and I understand, now.* 

*I thought you cursed me, Hewitt. But all transitions cause pain. I mean, how do you turn a liquid into a gas?*

*You boil it. And when it bubbles its tiny pleading screams, you certainly don’t stop.*

*You turn up the heat.*

\------------------

***11/11/02 - Day of the incident***

***Me:*** *Hello?* **(shouting)**

***Hewitt:*** *David, are you at home?*

***Me:*** *Doc - oh thank God. You…you gotta help me…oh God…it’s…it’s everywhere…I’m nothing…I’m nothing…* **(shouting)**

***Hewitt:*** *Can you get to the-***(I cut him off)**

***Me:*** *Please…please make it stop. Why doesn’t it ever…why doesn’t it ever stop…* **(Crying, shouting)**

***Hewitt:*** *David, I need you to calm down.*

***Me:*** *Am I hearing death, Hewitt? Can God hear what I can hear, Doc, or are they too scared?* **(Laughing, shouting)**

***Hewitt:*** *LISTEN.* **(shouting)**

***Me:*** … **(line goes dead)**

***Hewitt:*** *You’re hearing the microscopic, David. It was all just supposed to be a novel way to test the effectiveness of anti-infectious agents. Once they stopped moving, we know the medication killed them. We stood to make a lot of money off of the technology, but we couldn't prove it worked. Not until you. You’ve…you’ve helped so many people, David…*

***Me:*** **(quietly)** *I’ve been able…able to hear, able to feel…the billions of living things…moving around…on my skin…inside me…everywhere…*

***Hewitt:*** *Don't call an ambulance, don't call the police. We're coming to pick you up.*

\------------------

I don't remember much from that night other than this conversation. I can vaguely recall Hewitt arriving at my apartment, remote in hand. He examines my head, and I'm fading in and out of consciousness. 

When I fully come to, I'm lying on my couch, holding a gun I'd never seen before. A few steps away is Hewitt's corpse. 

And I start crying - not out of fear or confusion, out of relief. 

It's finally quiet. Silent as the grave. The endless drumming of infinite microorganisms crawling around me and within me has vanished. 

Just then, my weeping is interpreted by man rounding the corner into my living room. He's well dressed with dark blue eyes, and he walks over to sit next to me, stepping over Hewitt as he does. 

He introduces himself as Hewitt. Tells me the body won't be needing the name anymore, so it's his now. 

*""Listen, David, we have some new terms. You can still keep the device, meaning you can keep your hearing. Its fixed now, too. You won't be hearing anything you weren't meant to hear from now until the day you die.""*

*""As with any fair deal, I have some conditions. You can't tell anyone what you heard, and you have to take the fall for the killing of the nameless body in front of you. If you do those things, you'll be safe.""*

*""Fail to abide by those conditions, and we're turning the noise back on. All of it. And we'll leave it on, up until the moment you choke on your own tongue. Not a second sooner.""*

*""Do you understand, David?""*

\------------------

I agreed to the terms then, but I've had a little change of heart. Jail gave me perspective. 

You see, the punishment behind incarceration is that you lose your autonomy. That's your incentive to reform. Serve your time, play by the rules and hey, maybe we'll give you your agency back. Maybe you'll have an opportunity to own your body again. 

It makes you realize that agency and autonomy are the only things that really have value in this world. Without them, you have nothing. 

And what is this implant, but another jail? I've wanted to speak up for so damn long, but the threat of being subjected to the drumming again has kept me silent. 

Well, I've changed. I'm tired of just settling for what they'll give me. I want my goddamned agency back. 

So, to the creators of the implant, consider this my resignation from our contract. In addition, I have a few choice words. I am relying on the internet to carry them to you, wherever you are.

1ih0e53,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1ih0e53/sometimes_i_wish_i_wasnt_here/,Sometimes I wish I wasn't here...,"Hello, I'm a 35 year old man, I live in the UK and really am depressed here. I don't like the country I was born in at all, from dealing with being bullied to racism growing up and very aggressive strict parents.

I moved to Canada and got married some years ago but my wife divorced me around 2019 I came back to the UK some years ago with my life in pieces.

I thought I would never return to the UK and was so happy there in Canada. Now the government has cut my money and I can't afford my rent. I sometimes wish I was dead. Today has been particularly hard as I have an appointment with those that cut my rent / financial aid tomorrow and my mind is racing.

I discovered after my wife left me and I was forcibly taken by the SWAT team to a mental health unit and locked away in a ward, that I had Bipolar and complex PTSD as well as a few other things.

I feel miserable here in the UK and just want an end to the emotional pain I feel. After being locked away I was never the same, my happy confident nature went away. I felt caged and that the police could treat me like garbage and get away with it. What kind of freedoms do we really have?

I now spend my days as a solo developer making VR apps for the Meta Quest.

I'm lucky my family now understand how tough it has been for me but my mind is a complete mess. I struggle to remember simple things and stay organized although my work as a solo developer does not pay me much at all I have a wonderful feeling knowing my work is downloaded and seen by people around the world. That's the only thing that brings me some peace.

I am a tortured artist though, I spend far too long trying to get my apps for the Meta Quest headset perfect (60-70 hours per week) and not enough people buy them adding to the financial strain I feel. I know 12 month in people are only starting to discover my apps.

I am also unfit for a normal job and nobody wishes to give me a chance anyways.

I feel lonely too but I enjoy working alone and learning my craft as I work. Sometimes I wake up as early as 2-3am to start work on my apps.

I'm struggling with addiction to nicotine and have for the most part managed to quit cannabis too which did help me a bit from time to time to stay calm and even be able to sleep when I could not.

I often recount my time in Canada where I was so happy, I can't see an easy way back there now and lack the energy and mental capacity to find a way to return.

The good memories haunt me too, like going to the cottage with my ex-wife and kayaking, biking and hiking, all things that are not so easily adopted by UK culture and city life here.

I ended up on social media in some downtime today and was deeply depressed after a while of scrolling through videos of delinquents being arrested by police or gun videos or other stupid shit that just rots your brain. I don't often doom scroll but when I did today it depressed me so much that we live in a hate filled world full of crime.

I guess I feel very unlucky in life so far and have found it so hard to open up to anyone about this and how I'm feeling. The mental health services here are garbage and I'm at the end of a very long waiting list to get councilling which I otherwise cannot afford.

I hate my life, my self sabotaging nature sometimes, my inability to be happy with what little I have which is close to nothing.

I know there won't easily be a place for me in society which is why I developed VR apps to help others like me unwind and relax in VR and try and create a career for myself at my own pace.

I created two apps to help those with Bipolar, PTSD or stress, simply relax.

Its been 12 months almost from knowing nothing about developing apps to teaching myself and on occasion hiring others where the work became too complex but I needed things done.

I guess I hoped for more from life and was disappointed. I feel as if I'm halfway through life and barely reached my peak. I can't afford a train ticket or a cup of coffee most days.

If you have any advice for me I'm listening because right now I feel my life is not worth it, I feel the world is based on corruption and corrupt world leaders and I am ashamed to be a part of it.

Today I'm struggling, I have told myself to take a break from app development for a while because I have barely taken a break for almost a year.

So I have a childhood friend (24f), let's call her Anna. She had a baby about 9 months ago with her boyfriend.Their relationship is not the healthiest in my opinion but that's not the point. Her boyfriend has a friend, let's call him Alex (32m) and we met last year at Anna's birthday party. We really got along well, we both love hiking and decided to go on a hike date and it went really well. He is very nice, humble and fun, I can't say anything bad about him. The date was great and we kissed at the end. After a couple of days later we met for coffee and he told me that he is looking for something serious and it would probably not work out between us because of the age difference. I understood his point of view and we didn't go out for dates anymore. I told what happend to Anna and she said she is sorry to hear that as he is such a nice guy and so hot as well. She said that she is sorry she didn't meet Alex before she met her current boyfriend and had a baby with Alex instead. I was shocked but didn't wanna make a scene as me and Alex went out on just one date till then. Fast forward to this years New year's party which we celebrated at Anna and her boyfriend's place. There was about 10 of us and Alex as well. We got really drunk and me and Alex ended up sleeping together. It was nice. We met a couple of times afterwards and had sex but for the last two weeks I didn't really have much time. Anna started hiking with me about two months ago as she wanna lose some baby weight and for the last two weeks I didn't have time to go with her and honestly  she is too slow for my endurance. She went alone a couple of times but then she started inviting Alex to go on hikes with her. And now they hike a couple of times a week together. I feel a little weird about that. She said to me that they discussed me and that Alex said what a great girl I am and so nice to talk to. That's sweet but then Anna said that she doesn't get where this is coming from as I am ignoring him for the last two weeks. I gave her a weird look and told her I am not ignoring him and I just don't really have time for that stuff right now. She said that I should text him and start seeing him again because he is so sweet and fuckable. wtf. I just feel weird that they are hanging out together, and I can't understand if she is jealous of me or actually wants Alex and me together. Alex said that he is not looking for anything serious right now and neither am I but she said that after some time we will fall for eachother if we just keep seeing each other. I am so confused.

1ih0chm,https://www.reddit.com/r/puertovallarta/comments/1ih0chm/trip_report/,Trip report,"Recently came back from PV—my third time visiting PV and my boyfriend’s first.  Thought it could be helpful to leave impressions.

Airport—stupidly left debit card in one of the ATMs near exit and it was stolen and immediately used before the bank put a fraud hold on it.  We actually think it was an American couple that was hovering behind us and trying to chat us up to distract us.  This was the first time I had experienced crime in Mexico.

VIP airport transfer—didn’t want to do taxis or Uber so set up a transfer in advance for OK price on their website.  Was worth it to avoid initial stress with bags and finding a ride on landing.  But they messed up our return time and came early and then didn’t want to come back at right time so I would not use them for a return in future—taxi is fine for that.

Hotel Mousai—have stayed here before and the rooftop pools and balconies with hot tubs are the main draws. 

I think the service has actually gotten a bit nicer and friendlier since the last time I was here, but there is still an annoying pressure to do a timeshare talk which I just decline until they stop.  Our tub was broken the first day but they came immediately and had it fixed within an hour.  

The North tower is probably the way to go in terms of views and privacy on the balcony, although the lobby is not as nice and it’s a bit older.

On two nights our neighbors were loud into the small hours but I eventually heard security give them a lecture and they stopped.  This is sometimes a bit of a party hotel although the other nights were quiet.  

We did not do the all inclusive at Mousai because you would need to drink all day and/or eat every meal on property to make it worth it and we did not want to do that.  However we liked lunch and drinks on the rooftop on pool days.  If you want to buy a bottle of liquor from them they will use it to make your drinks your whole stay so that you’re not paying by the glass (the rooftop attendants are great and hooked us up with this).  The watermelon cocktail is A+.  The Baja shrimp tacos were the best thing we ate on the entire property.

The Japanese place at Mousai and the Mexican place at Garza Blanca are just OK.  Don’t bother with the toro at Hiroshi.

Significant other activities—

La Palapa—some people might think this restaurant is overrated or cheesy but I love this place and always go back.  The atmosphere is great—consider not sitting right in front of the public path so you don’t get propositioned by buskers and vendors but it’s great even there.  The food is good as are the drinks—the waiter somehow read my bf’s mind and offered his favorite dirty blue cheese martini on arrival which he thought was great.

Cafe des artistes—again this is touristy but the atmosphere is amazing.  My bf’s jaw dropped when they showed us to our table even though I had already told him it was a really lovely restaurant.  I am a sucker for the foie gras crème brûlée and we really liked the fish dishes.

Whale Photo Safari through Vallarta Adventures—really incredible tour both times I’ve done it.  Be aware you ride in an inflatable dinghy (not as small or scary as that makes it sound), which means you can get really close to the whales.  Both times I have done this they have come within feet of the boat and this time one swam directly under where we were sitting.  Last time I saw a mom whale with its newborn feet away.  This is a different tour from others that occur on larger boats with more people.  A woman we met said she hired a fisherman to take her out from Mislamoya and saw a bunch of whales that way.  And we saw a bunch of them breaching from our balcony and the rooftop pool.

Rhythm of the Night boat ride and acrobatic show—I had been avoiding this because it seemed incredibly cheesy but a woman at our hotel recommended it and the bf wanted to try it.  Be warned the boat ride over was quite a spectacle—lots of drunken shenanigans and loud music with party tricks by the crew.  This was sometimes annoying but it is a nice ride over the bay at twilight. The open bar drinks are just sweet cheap punch drinks and beer so nothing to get excited about.  

The atmosphere on the site is more pleasant but still very cheesy.  The show is mildly funny and the acrobatics are impressive but the show is sometimes eyerollingly silly.  The dinner they served after was just OK but the bf enjoyed eating right on the water.  The best thing was the Mexican coffee with kahlua.  The boat ride back was again loud which is a weird vibe shift after being on the site which they set up to have a more romantic vibe.

We had a good time and had a nice mix of relaxation and fun activities.  ",3,1738617564.0,puertovallarta,1,1.0,False

We talked the whole night, danced some, then went to a bar until I brought her to her train because she's actually from another city 2 hours away. Before I asked her if she would be down for coffee some time and she said yes. Now this weekend I was coincidentally staying at my parents which is not too far from where she lives, so I asked her if she'd be down to meet in the next 2 days. It took her until afternoon the next day to answer, even though I can see she's online on instagram a lot of times. She said she just came home but would be down for coffee. So 2 hours later I text her if she has got time tomorrow. Again, she's online and posts something to her story but no answer until the next day evening. She says she is sorry for not answering and is in bed with period cramps. 

  
Now, to me this is obviously a case of she is not interested in meeting up with me. Which I would be fine with because of the age gap and distance and everything. But in the same message she asked me something back which you would not usually assume is behavior of someone who does not care. And now I'm annoyed because in my head she does not care which is fine but then I'm like, just tell me you like me but I am too young or whatever you don't have the energy instead of telling me you want to meet up and then take a day to answer a simple question. Now she asked me something and I'd feel bad if I just ghosted her because I don't usually do that but at the same time I feel like an idiot for answering someone who in my head doesn't really care but maybe she's just a horribly bad texter. I could just straight up tell her that she doesn't have to beat around the bush and should just tell me if she doesn't want to meet but that feels to confronting for someone I don't really know.

So feel free to skip! It was already helpful to write it down (second try).

Second: i have to put some trigger warnings because of mental illness and more

Third: Its more a personal rant, cause i dont know who to talk to and if there are people understanding me then possibly here and my english is not the best, so i maybe mess up a few things and descriptions

I actually wrote a text before, but i deleted it accidentally, so ill try again with this one and a timeline for better understanding.

Im 26 and for further understanding i have to describe everything before sadly. 
So with 14 i began to develop a major depression, i refused help and took drugs instead. After a longer time period i got finally help and even visited a clinic a few times and became sertraline. I also got off any drugs except caffeine, nicotine and alcohol. 
The last visit was probably 2016 or 2017. 
This was the first time i developed physical problems. I got massive diarrea but nothing was found till 2023. I thought ist probably the ssri and the increased alcohol consumption. 
2022 i got covid first time. First 2/3 days were hard, very high fever i think but i recovered in one and a half week. Early 2023 i then got another colonoscopy and they found a microscopical colitis, combination of two types, but this was the first time, results were small and therefore i think it was probably a reaction to something but not a safe bet. 
Later in 2023 the symptoms changed, i drank less alcohol now im off since 2 years and reduced sertraline because of health incline and diarrea was disappearing, first it felt great, till it became constipation in 2024. 
Same time, so 2023 and 2024 i became less concentrated, my short term memory seemed to be worse compared to the years before and sleep problems came back. Sleeping early was always a problem because of my mental stuff but now it seemed i was not only sleeping longer because i felt depressed but because i needed it. Otherwise i developed worse stomach symptoms like pain and constipation next day, i felt somewhat sick like in an early infection and got neck pain.
This, combined with hypochondric fears, got so bad that i did doctor hopping and i started to research a lot. But doctors couldnt find a clear reason. 
My colitis seemed to be „cured“ as the constipation was in a normal unfrequent range without complications and all other doctors, like my cardiologist couldnt find a specific reason for any symptom. 
At least till i listened to a friend, that suffers from ME since 2016 or something like that, i went to a doctor and checked for his antibodies. MAChr 3 and 4 as well as beta adrenerg aak 1 and 2. 
They were all elevated in exactly the same pattern as his. But these are no guarantee for or against any disease so i never got a diagnosis, not even from his doctor who said a post viral syndrome is likely and it could even explain the change of my colitis, but it cant be proven. 
Some other results are kinda interesting but also no safe thing, so my histamine is too high, DAO too low and the laboratory said it looks like an mastcell associated inflammation, but its not enough for a histamine intolerance according to my doctors. 

So right now i try to get a job done, next to my college and its not really working out. 
Im off sertraline since 3 months, after trying to get rid of it for 2 years, my therapy is coming to an end and nobody has any clue whats wrong or to be exact everyone has an own idea. 

To conclude my symptoms that may be completely psychosomatic according to my therapist and some doctors or may be post viral according to others:
I have the „irritable colon“ and an „irritable bladder“ (this one is only a few months old and developed slowly). I have up and downs. 
In my up phases (i assume ist adrenaline keeping me going) i can function to 80 percent of my old limits. Only things i notice is a worse short term memory, lack of concentration to a small degree and i get somewhat dizzy if i concentrate for too long. 
In my bad phases even going into the city to meet up for a cup of coffee results in feverish feelings, im tired and need to rest and sleep more to „recover“.
I cant sleep fast because of the bladder and i need proper sleep for 8 or 9 hours in my bad phases, otherwise i get those bad feelings, my stomach feels sour, i feel sick and somewhat out of energy like i think a zombie must feel, somewhat outburned and to be honest a bit disgusting, i feel sweaty and stinky even though nobody said its actually the case. These phases are coming irregulary but if they fully develop i get nothing done besides laying in the bad and watching stuff or sleeping. Learning is like studying an entire new language in these phases. I read sentence and ist lost in the fog before im done with the next. Sometimes i get neck pain, dry eyes, dry mouth with bad taste, strong heartbeat (which seems to be not that fast, that its a problem) – even after eating or standing up is still in the normal range, no pots. 
I could bring up more points, like my lowered caffeine and cold tolerance, which are both extremely obvious to me and others, because i was highly tolerant in both 5 years ago… 
I could also mention the skin of my hands, its either sweaty and cold through midday or completely dry and inelastic like dried leather if i get tired and no lotion seems to help enough, but as all of my points this could be explained with other things, for example i wash my hands too often… 
So in conclusion: i personally feel worse since i got covid, especially since mid 2023… i think many symptoms are related to some types of stress, but its not really consistent enough. 
Same time i have unclear results from my doctors and as many of those symptoms are also explainable through my mental condition or other reasons, i cant even say whats true. 

If i have a good high energy day like today i can write a longer text and im wondering why i even think about it, seems all good… im just lazy thats it… 

In a bad phase i really think there is something bad happening and that i should get a result finally. In those phases im also pretty confident, that its the adrenaline of my stress that keeps me going in the good phases, cause it feels like it. 

The only way to provoke a bad phase is actually constant stress for a few days with tough work. Like my exam last september. After two weeks i felt like a zombie. Not just tired or exhausted, i felt sick, really really sick. Like i did some bad bad drugs and had to feel the consequences for a few days.
While thinking about it, „bad phases“ actually feel like a combination of beeing sick and recovering from a stressfull night with a lot of stimulants. 

Overall my biggest problem is, independent from any possible reasons, that i think i have way too less capacity to get the stuff done people get done around me. I have practically no social life at all, i visit my sick friend once a week for an hour, thats it. 
I nearly completely stopped gaming and similar hobbies cause most times i only can concentrate enough for maybe an hour and then i see a rapid decline in my performance so its no fun anymore. This decline is btw. not the same as my „crashes“, its just something i discover on a daily basis, like going to work and forgetting what i have explained to customers half an hour ago, while coworkers still know what happened. Those performance problems affecting short term memory, concentration, vigilance, loss of eye focus, feeling somewhat dizzy after a time and reduced cognitive clarity like brainfog are permanently coming, but as they can be just symptoms of exhaustion that feels extreme for me cause i focus too much, they dont get attention as beeing pathological. Also they dont seem to be that significant, that people would tell me that. Even though i find it highly suspicious that other people dont seem to have those problems… „everyone is different – its in a normal range – life with it“
To get my job done (when i have to stand up early Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday), i reduce my sleep from Saturday to Sunday already, i try to keep awake up to 2 or 3 and stand up after a few hours, so the Sunday will feel bad, but i get to sleep in the evening so i get through the days Monday and Tuesday. 
This goes completely on to my moods. I feel too weak to get it done, im not studying properly, but without an explanation nobody understands whats happening and if i have good day i even doubt myself that anything is wrong, till i „crash“ again and need a few days to recover… 
Even if i have vacation and can focus completely on my studying, my performance is mediocre at best… while i didnt had to to much in the first semesters to get through an exam now i do double the amount and get the same results.
Thank you for reading. There are still a lot things missing and i probably forgot those details that are highly relevant. I also know that im still way fitter than most of you here and that i shouldnt bother too much. 
But i dont know who to talk to anymore…
I know there are no tests to get a diagnosis ruled out or approved, but if there are tests that can be done and that are affordable, i would have done them by now - if I know which one for sure… If you have any ideas, tipps or something else, let me know. I'm interested: what would you do? 
Just keep going and internalising its the mindset - cause obviously doctors say I'm pretty much fine - so don't listen to myself, it's probably hypochondria so screw it - or would search for some help? 

For anyone who has read till here… I'm impressed, I feel honoured you went through this and im sorry you had to and i hope i didnt ruin everything for you today…

I wish you all the best

1ih08cd,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1ih08cd/my_sister_is_in_an_abusive_relationship_and_its/,My sister is in an abusive relationship and it's killing me,"I (F, 23) have come to the realization that my sister (F, 20) is in an abusive relationship. I was in an abusive relationship of my own for six years, and though it left me with an insane level of trust issues, it also provided me with plenty of clarity after the fact, in regards to how we work and function in an abusive relationship. 

He isolates her whenever given the chance, he doesn't seem to like her going anywhere without his presence. If anyone speaks against his behaviors, were told we just hate him for no reason and that she loves him more than she's ever loved anyone before. They get into frequent arguments that entail them screaming at each other, according to the people my sister lives with. When the arguments go too far, he often gives her gifts and money to get her to stay - the most recent occurrence i know of, was my sister trying to dump him and in response he bought her a play station five. He got mad at her at one point because my own boyfriend approached my sister to greet her on campus...as if it's some heinous act for someone to know someone else on a COLLEGE CAMPUS.

 A few days ago, she called a friend she lives with and stated that her boyfriend had hit her coffee out of her hand and grabbed her arm to prevent her from leaving during an argument, and said she was scared he was going to hit her. The same night, when said friend was texting her about being worried about this relationship, the ""boyfriends cat"" somehow managed to break her computer screen. 

I can see the physical and mental change in my sister. This past summer she began stealing from and trying to manipulate those of us who live at home, while refusing to work, which led to us all purchasing lock boxes for our posessions that we didn't want stolen. She has larger bags under her eyes than the exhausted mothers I see come into my job, and complains about her mental health deteriorating. I've noticed bruises on her before, specifically her neck but she explains them away. She barely eats, and is with her boyfriend every waking hour of the day. Recently, when visiting her apartment, she arrived and 15 minutes later stayed she missed her boyfriend (who she was just with) and so she left to be with him again .

It kills me that there is nothing I can do to fix this. Our relationship has suffered immensely, I am not one to tolerate lying, manipulation, and stealing. She wasn't like this before, she was hard working and kind - sure, maybe a bit abrasive, but we're all like that in my family. 

I can't say anything to her, or she'll distance herself more or talk to her boyfriend about it which will lead to more isolation. I can't say anything to him, or he'll take it out on her. I can't say anything to our parents, they'll talk to her which will, again, lead to further isolation. The only option is to continue to be kind and passive in hopes that one day she figures out that this isn't a relationship she wants to be in. 

I don't know what else to say except that I feel hopeless, helpless, and I miss my baby sister. ",1,1738617281.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False
