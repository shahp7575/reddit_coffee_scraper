Everything started fine, but the night took a turn.  

Rick and Nancy (the newer couple who got their kid(3F) along) brought food without asking anyone’s preferences—just chicken biryani and a small veg curry for our vegetarian friend, Veronica, without rice or bread. (We didn’t know because the food was packed up until dinner to keep it warm). Well, dinner time came and they suggested I stop playing to cook rice for her or that she should just eat around the chicken (which she couldn't due to allergens). Veronica & James bought alcohol - Whiskey for all of us and a $68 wine which Nancy wanted. 

Nancy also asked us to lock up our two cats upstairs out of sight despite having no allergies or fears—just because she doesn’t like animals (She said she wasn’t pet friendly and doesn’t trust them). One of our cats, who loves people and is very vocal & affectionate, was enamoured by the child and touched the child’s leg with his paw and sniffed her feet because it was his first time seeing a tiny human, but she repeatedly shoved him away with her foot. My cat was nothing if not gentle but he got sad by the shoving and whimpered, so I scooped him and he sat on my lap limply and quietly for the rest of the night.

Throughout the evening:  
- Nancy spilled a bottle of wine all over our coffee table and rug.  
- She let her child do watercolor painting (brought a book from home) on our light-colored couch. A few paint strokes were left.
- She threw chicken bones into the recycling bin instead of the trash (right next to it).  
- Her child broke a sentimental statue, and instead of telling us, she hid the broken pieces in a potpourri vase.  (Found it later during clean-up)
- Rick got drunk (he emptied 2/3 of the whiskey - sneaking shots behind our backs), and spilled ketchup on our couch.  
- They refused a ride home despite Rick barely being able to stand, insisting they’d be fine after a couple of hours. We repeatedly told them that we’d drop them or book them an uber but they were adamant.

Before leaving, they asked me to pack up all the leftovers for them (1 plate of each item left). They later texted saying they got home safely, but my husband was furious and vented to James and Veronica. They told us they’d had similar issues with them before but thought it was a one-off. Clearly, it wasn’t.  

Now, my husband’s birthday is next week, and I had already invited them before game night. He obviously doesn’t want them there. How do I politely rescind the invite?  ",2,1740629257.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

Coffee makers come in various types, each with its own process. From drip coffee makers to single-serve machines, the choices are vast. Learning to use them can make your mornings smoother. A coffee maker can save you money and time if used correctly.

This guide will help you understand the basic steps. It will also offer tips to enhance your coffee experience. Whether you’re a beginner or looking to improve, these steps will be useful. Let’s dive into the world of coffee makers and discover how to brew that perfect cup.



# Choosing Your Coffee Maker

Want to brew the perfect cup of coffee at home? [Choosing the right coffee maker is the first step.](https://gomehedi.com/best-hot-coffee-maker/) With so many options available, it can be overwhelming to decide which one suits your needs. This guide will help you understand the different types of coffee makers and the factors to consider when making your choice.

# Types Of Coffee Makers

There are several types of coffee makers to choose from, each with its own set of features. Understanding these types will help you make an informed decision:

* **Drip Coffee Makers:** These are the most common. They use a filter to brew coffee and are great for making multiple cups at once.
* [**Single-Serve Coffee Makers**](https://gomehedi.com/best-single-serve-coffee-maker/)**:** Perfect for a quick cup. They use pods or capsules and are very convenient.
* **French Press:** This manual coffee maker lets you control the brewing time and coffee-to-water ratio, offering a rich taste.
* [**Espresso Machines**](https://gomehedi.com/best-espresso-machines/)**:** Ideal for espresso lovers. They come in manual, semi-automatic, and fully automatic versions.
* [**Percolators**](https://gomehedi.com/best-coffee-percolator/)**:** These old-school coffee makers brew strong coffee by cycling boiling water through the grounds.
* **AeroPress:** This portable option uses air pressure to brew coffee quickly. It’s great for travelers.

# Factors To Consider

When choosing a coffee maker, several factors can influence your decision. Here are some key points to think about:

* **Budget:** Coffee makers range in price from affordable to high-end. Determine how much you’re willing to spend.
* **Capacity:** Consider how much coffee you drink. Single-serve machines are good for one cup, while drip coffee makers can brew a whole pot.
* **Brewing Time:** If you need coffee quickly, look for a machine with a short brewing time. Single-serve and AeroPress options are fast.
* **Ease of Use:** Some machines require more effort than others. Automatic machines are usually simpler to operate.
* **Maintenance:** Think about how easy it is to clean. Machines with fewer parts are generally easier to maintain.
* **Features:** Some coffee makers come with extra features like programmable settings, built-in grinders, or milk frothers.

Here’s a quick comparison table to help you decide:

|Type|Pros|Cons|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Drip Coffee Maker|Easy to use, makes multiple cups|Requires filters, can be bulky|
|Single-Serve|Convenient, quick|Costly pods, limited to one cup|
|French Press|Rich flavor, manual control|More effort, cleaning required|
|Espresso Machine|High-quality espresso, versatile|Expensive, complex|
|Percolator|Strong coffee, durable|Can over-extract, old-fashioned|
|AeroPress|Portable, quick|Single cup, manual effort|

# Essential Tools And Ingredients

Using a coffee maker can be a delightful experience, but having the right tools and ingredients is crucial. This ensures you get the best cup of coffee every time. Understanding the essentials will make your coffee-making process smoother and more enjoyable.

# Coffee Beans Vs. Ground Coffee

Choosing between coffee beans and ground coffee depends on your preference and convenience. Both have their advantages and can affect the flavor of your coffee.

**Coffee Beans:**

* **Freshness:** Coffee beans retain their freshness longer than ground coffee. They preserve the oils and flavors that give coffee its rich taste.
* **Customization:** You can grind the beans to your desired consistency, whether you prefer a coarse or fine grind.
* **Variety:** Purchasing whole beans gives you access to a wider range of coffee varieties and blends.

**Ground Coffee:**

* **Convenience:** Ground coffee saves time as it is ready to use. No need for a grinder.
* **Storage:** Ground coffee takes up less space and is easier to store.
* **Consistency:** Pre-ground coffee ensures a uniform grind size, which can be beneficial for certain brewing methods.

Consider using a table to compare the two:

|Aspect|Coffee Beans|Ground Coffee|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Freshness|Lasts longer|Shorter shelf life|
|Customization|High|Low|
|Convenience|Requires grinding|Ready to use|

# Water Quality Matters

The quality of water you use significantly impacts the taste of your coffee. Good water can enhance the flavor, while poor water can ruin even the best beans.

**Why Water Quality is Important:**

* **Flavor:** Impurities in water can alter the taste of your coffee. Chlorine, for example, can give an unpleasant flavor.
* **Consistency:** Using the same quality of water ensures your coffee tastes the same every time.
* **Machine Maintenance:** High mineral content in water can lead to scale buildup in your coffee maker, affecting its performance and lifespan.

**Tips for Better Water Quality:**

1. Use filtered water to remove impurities and improve taste.
2. Avoid distilled water as it lacks minerals that contribute to coffee flavor.
3. Consider using bottled spring water for a balance of purity and minerals.

Here’s a quick table for water quality tips:

|Tip|Benefit|
|:-|:-|
|Filtered Water|Removes impurities|
|Spring Water|Balanced minerals|
|Avoid Distilled Water|Keeps essential minerals|

Paying attention to these factors ensures a delicious cup of coffee every time you use your coffee maker.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1iz6zd0,https://www.reddit.com/r/UntoldAmishExperience/comments/1iz6zd0/amish_crush_pt4/,Amish Crush Pt.4,"I asked him why he wasn’t married tonight when I met up with him to give him the keys to my father’s place. He is going over there super early in the morning at like 6am and I will still be asleep so I met him in the next torn over to exchange the keys. He sat in my car a bit with me and it wasn’t as awkward this time. He actually has opened up quite a bit in the last two days and it’s nice to watch. 

His response to my question was that most married young in his community and he wasn’t ready to settle down so young but now he’s in a tough spot because all the women his age are married so there are very few to “pick” from. He said if he could go back he probably would marry young because it can get lonely now sometimes.

I went over and sat in his truck and we spoke about life and how I would like to write to him and stay in touch even when he goes back downstate for the summer and I’ll most likely be leaving as well. I told him I really don’t want to leave but I may have to for just one more year to button my life up. He told me his family gets the mail sometimes so he said maybe he could get a PO Box that I can write to and send photos of my place and life updates. 

We just sat and looked eachother in the eyes while he had his hands resting on my cheek and I told him I could stay in this moment forever. He apologized for his hands being rough and I told him that is one of the things that I like about him. I like that he is a strong yet gentle man and is a hard worker. He told me he’s going to bring me down some maple syrup he’s been harvesting this winter now that it’s flowing again. 

I truly believe we meet everyone for a reason and no matter what happens, I will always remember the Amish man who gave me butterflies like I was a teenager again (that feeling is hard to come by). 

I told him I’ll meet him tomorrow morning at my father and bring us both coffee since there isn’t a coffee pot there. 

I hope everyone who is reading this has had a beautiful day and just know that there is always light at the end of the tunnel. Life is truly beautiful even with its ups and down.

The relationship ended due to financial irresponsibility and some concerning behavior.

Financial Issues:
	•	She had $35K in credit card debt and bought a $55K car just because she liked the color, bringing her total debt to $90K (by the time she’s done paying interest). She is also 30 and lives at home with no real expenses or rent. 

	•	She was earning around $21K/year as a realtor and hadn’t sold a house in 4 months.

	•	She didn’t know how to pay off her credit card and couldn’t clearly explain how she accumulated so much debt when I asked her

	•	She spent on unnecessary luxuries like $60/month culligen water delivery and two gym memberships while drowning in debt. I also tried to help set up a monthly budget and she refused 3 times as she didn’t want to show me her banking which makes me think there was more debt she was hiding. I only knew of the 35k and car because she told me. She would also say that she didn’t have bad spending habits despite the debt. And she would always say she is a self made woman while she lives at home and is actively losing money everyday. 

	•	I helped her get a debt consolidation loan and set up a meeting for her to see a financial planner, but she was defensive and emotional about it and came home crying as he told her she needed to double the amount of houses she sold 

	•	She has a pattern of instability — failed her real estate exam 8 times, has 6 speeding tickets, and has been fired from 3 jobs.

Reckless Behavior:

She ran a red light last week to get to me faster.
Once flipped off a cop while we were driving. And she constantly blurs boundaries with other men and engages and seeks out conversations with them and says she is networking for clients. 

She also went out for coffee with an old tinder flame and said they were friends. She didn’t tell me until a month later. And I voiced this saying I felt uncomfortable about it. And then she asked if she could call him on the phone a few weeks later. 

Despite all this, I cared deeply about her. She started making some changes, but only after a lot of pressure from me. I felt like I was becoming her financial coach instead of her partner.

Did I give up too soon, or was this breakup the right decision? 

TL;DR: Broke up with my girlfriend of 8 months due to financial irresponsibility ($90K in debt, impulsive spending, no stable income) and lack of emotional boundaries with men. She failed her real estate exam 8 times, had 6 speeding tickets, got fired from 3 jobs, and didn’t know how to pay off her credit card at 30. She also engaged in conversations with other men that blurred boundaries (e.g., went for coffee with an old Tinder match, responded to flirty messages from coworkers/clients). She was sweet, family-oriented, and we had a strong emotional/physical connection, but the long-term concerns felt too big to ignore. Now I’m struggling with missing her and wondering if I made the right decision. Did I do the right thing?",5,1740628573.0,relationships,10,0.86,False

I’m dealing with a situation where my 31f boyfriend’s 32m comment really hurt my feelings, and I’m not sure how to approach it without escalating things. Here’s what happened:
Today, I didn’t have breakfast, had a bit of tofu for lunch, and then came home to drink coffee and went for a work out. Later, I put 3 chicken drumsticks on my plate for dinner. My boyfriend saw it and commented, “Are you going to eat all that? That’s fatty.” I was really hurt and ended up bursting into tears.
I explained to him how his comment made me feel, and he said I need to “grow up” and that there’s no need to cry. When I tried to explain that I need encouragement on my weight loss journey, he said he was just keeping me “in check.” since that what I asked him to do. I love honestly but I felt like he didn’t understand how his words affected me.
He apologized, saying he won’t do it again, but now he’s shut down completely and said he’s not going to say anything from now on.

Total cost: $20k or around $220 per guest.,"I posted this a few months ago, and I thought updating it with final numbers now that we are only a few weeks out may help some of you!

This forum has been so helpful as we’ve planned our wedding and hopefully this helps someone else. 

Though we initially had a goal of staying around $15k, we are very pleased with the deals we’ve found, especially with the inflation rate! According to the Knot, the average wedding cost of a wedding in 2024 in the two cities closest to us is $33k and $37k, so I’m happy with our $20k price tag.

Please see the breakdown below: 

Venue: $5,500 for a 48 hour rental. We booked for a Wednesday & Thursday with the ceremony to be held Thursday night. The cost of a Friday & Saturday was $20,000! We had major savings by doing a weeknight. The venue includes all tables, chairs, cottages for the bride & groom for 48 hours (or two nights during the event) and a day of event coordinator which is a game changer. All setup and cleanup is included in the package. Of course, weeknight weddings are definitely a “know your crowd and know what works best for you and your partner” decision.

Additional Coordinator Services: $320. This includes some help with table settings and end of night duties.

Venue security: $330

Officiant: Free. Family friend.

Marriage license: $21

Venue insurance: $313

Rehearsal dinner: $350 for 15 people. We are catering BBQ.

Wedding day brunch for wedding party: $200. Charcuterie boards, sandwiches, coffee, & fruit. 

DJ: $822

Violinist: $810. She will play the ceremony and cocktail hour. This is a big splurge for us. 

Linen rentals: $733. This includes all flatware and linens.

Catering: $3,535. This was a STEAL! Other quotes were double this. This rate includes non alcoholic drinks, passed appetizers, salads, rolls, entree with two sides, and a full dessert bar. This includes all vendor meals and all tips for servers. 

Coffee bar: $600. Full service lattes for 100 guests with a customized menu and customized cups with our wedding logo included! Two baristas included for two hours of service.

Florals: $890. This includes my bouquet, three bridesmaids bouquets, 11 centerpieces, and eight boutonnières. We are using H‑E‑B for this service!

Photograpy and Videography: $2,300. We got another great deal on this one. This includes our engagement session, 9 hours of photography on our wedding day, and 3 hours of videography for the ceremony and part of the reception.

Decor: $500 give or take a little. Signage, table numbers, guest book, etc. We are using a mix of Canva and a local printing company.

Invitations & thank you cards & postage: $250

Suit with tailoring, belt, and dress shoes: $650 

My dress: $900 from David’s Bridal.

Alterations: The total cost is between $550 - $750. This one was a huge sticker shock for me! I’m waiting for my final appointment for the final cost.

Photo Booth: $500 for two hours. Includes prints!

Wedding Party Gifts: $250

That’s everything! I know it’s not under $10k but I’m very proud of how it’s all come together and the deals we’ve managed to find for such great prices. We are hoping for a beautiful and memorable event with those we love. 💕 💕💕

TLDR; Managed to get all professional vendors for our 90 guest wedding for around $20k! 🎉🎉🎉

We messaged eachother with it was nice meeting eachother and if we are not too busy we can do coffee or hangout one day. 

The individual randomly called me a few days later and when I didn’t answer they texted me saying they hope I’ve had a good week and they have question for me. The text was vague so I gave them a call back and they were mentioning how they are an entrepreneur and if I’m interested in making some passive income. And we can set up a meeting to go over some detail bc I was asking questions like the nature of the business, compensation and hours. I accepted the scheduling of the meeting bc I am a curious person and wouldn’t mind some passive income even tho I have a full time job. She said she was some form of realtor that worked with Redfin?but then she said she’s an entrepreneur for e-commerce business that drives traffic through websites. 

When asked about compensation she mentioned the income depends on what is drives online. but I’ve been researching the individual and the supposed business. I found her Instagram and lists their business name as a management group. The business seems relatively new and or small and they are not registered with the Secretary of State records. I guess I have more questions then answers after that phone call she didn’t seem pushy but I’m not sure if this an MLM or some form of scam?

Let’s be honest: I enjoy a good coffee in the Arts District as much as anyone, but none of those spots in “noho” reflect the people who have called this place home for generations.

Take El Manguito, for example—a staple of the community and, without question, one of the best Salvadoran restaurants in the Valley. Their pupusas? Easily among the finest in Los Angeles. Before you dismiss North Hollywood as the next step in manifest destiny, step outside the Arts District and appreciate a classic pupuserja - if you still can’t see the value in the businesses that built this community, then you shouldn’t move here .

I am currently 21 years old and I have this fucking addiction to gambling online. I mostly play blackjack. But i addiction really went to the worse on december 2024. before that i would only play occasionally. Before my addiction I add a credit card with around 2.5k and my car loan of 8k 

Until early december 2024 My bank called me because of suspicion of fraud on my credit card. It was nothing and got resolved... During the phone call i asked the person that my credit card interest was high and how i could avoid it. They told me that if i add debt that i could get a loan with lower interest rate to help pay the card. and showed me how to get the loan inside the banks mobile app. Then in my head that gave me the idea of taking a loan to gamble and pay my credit card. I first took a loan of 5k december 15th. I lost the whole 5k in 2-3 days. then on december 27th I took another loan of 5k and i made in 2-3 days 10k profit. 

So now i am at 15k in the bank with 10k personal loan, 2.5k credit card and 8k on my car. So if i would of been smart i would've payed the 10k loan and my credit card and start the year with 2.5k and 8k car loan.

But no instead on the night of January 3rd 2025 I lost 10k. after that night I told myself that i would stop gambling for good. 

Until the 1st February I lost the remaining of everything that i add left that was around 7k. So Now i add 0$ to my name with approximately 20k in debt.  I tried to get another loan of 5k but my bank declined me.

Then i decided to call my Grand-mother that always spoiled me and always helped me in my diffucult situations. I Straight up lied to her face and said that I got sick and missed to many days at work and im missing money to pay for my things. She decided to help me and she sent me as a gift to help me get back on my feet 5k. She said i hope thatr this will help and I love you. As i am writting this, this is making me sick to my stomach. My grandma is such a good person and i lied tp her for my fucking stupid addiction that put me in this shit position. 

Then in not even 2-3 hours after getting the 5k I lost everything gambling. 

then i worked hard in the upcoming weeks to be able to pay for my things. Then by miracle during the weekend of valentine's Day i made 7k profit gambling with the last 250$ to my name. after that i told myself it was over and that i would focus on working hard and not gamble.

Then Today I lost everything that i add to my name. I called my grandma again for help and again I told her some bullshit excuses. She said that she could loan me 15k and i said yes. Not even couple hours later I lost everything. 

  
I feel like a fucking loser that failed in life Because I lost 20k from my grandma that she worked hard for. No one in my family knows in shit i am. Now i have 0$ and bills are coming idk what im going to do. No kidding i cant even go to my local store to buy a 1$ coffee. I have nothing.

I have 8k car loan, maxed credit card at 3k, 10k personal loan, 15k loan from my grandma. In total: 36k

So i came from november 2024 with little to 0 debt. to now with all this debt and i feel like absolute shit and i don't know what to do. I make around 1k every 2 weeks. I am 21 years old stuck working years to pay off stupid debt of my gambling addiction. Now today i realized that i may of ruined my life and everything will now suck for years. I will never find a partner because i will never be able to afford anything in life. 

If you are reading this please let me know what you think I should do. And please don't gamble it will ruin your life. Because simply mine is over. i have years of hardwork and saving money to pay off debt that i accumulated in **2 MONTHS.**",2,1740627762.0,GamblingAddiction,0,1.0,False

The weight loss has slowed down considerably so this week I’m taking a “diet break” which means I’m still OMAD but eating things I actually enjoy. Still eating below maintenance calories. Lost 2lbs the last couple days. Huzzah! 

This photo is tangible evidence that it’s actually working as I still view myself as the left pic. 

Exercise wise I walk very inconsistently. Sometimes a lot sometimes… not a lot. 

After 6ish months I think I’ve got the hang of this. I only eat when my brain tells me to eat and not my stomach. But relapse is always around the corner so I have to monitor my shit and stay vigilant.

I am looking to upgrade my Niche Zero setup and was looking at flat burrs grinders. I am mostly using my Niche for Espresso but also filters sometimes (and I have phases where I only do filter for a few days/weeks).
For Espresso I mostly drink straight shots, Americanos, Espresso Tonics and milk drinks in that order.

I drink self-roasted (mostly lower altitude) coffees roasted at light-medium levels.

The Timemore is very intruiging and the reviews favorable. But it seems like everyone evaluated it at the Kickstarter price. It seems that the $800 is a bit high to me.
What are others thinking. Obviously the whole thing is subjective but we have been there before with the Niche’s original price which was much more worth it than what it is now with the current competition.

My upgrade budget would be $800 and I have looked at the DF83 v3 as well but not sure how well the stock burrs do with filter. It seems that the O78S does well with both with an emphasis on espresso which is exactly what I am looking for.",1,1740627214.0,espresso,7,1.0,False

I need to buy a new moka pot that will be used to make almost exclusively specialty coffee and so far the E&B lab moka pot (1 cup) seems to be the logical choice, also because of the short “chimney” which gives a constant and perfectly uniform extraction flow unlike my current moka (a 3/1 Giannina) which is temperamental and gurgles a lot because of the tall chimney that is not suited for specialty coffee.

What I don’t like about the E&B lab moka (induction) is that half of if is made of aluminium and I would like a 100% stainless steel moka pot, so I was also considering buying the E&B filter and pair it with a different pot, but the problem here is that I need a Bialetti like extraction with an extremely regular flow, and I wouldn’t know which model to choose and if the results would be the same or mostly the same as using the E&B moka pot.

Total cost: $20k or around $220 per guest.,"I posted this a few months ago, and I thought updating it with final numbers now that we are only a few weeks out may help some of you!

This forum has been so helpful as we’ve planned our wedding and hopefully this helps someone else. 

Though we initially had a goal of staying around $15k, we are very pleased with the deals we’ve found, especially with the inflation rate! According to the Knot, the average wedding cost of a wedding in 2024 in the two cities closest to us is $33k and $37k, so I’m happy with our $20k price tag.

Please see the breakdown below: 

Venue: $5,500 for a 48 hour rental. We booked for a Wednesday & Thursday with the ceremony to be held Thursday night. The cost of a Friday & Saturday was $20,000! We had major savings by doing a weeknight. The venue includes all tables, chairs, cottages for the bride & groom for 48 hours (or two nights during the event) and a day of event coordinator which is a game changer. All setup and cleanup is included in the package. Of course, weeknight weddings are definitely a “know your crowd and know what works best for you and your partner” decision.

Additional Coordinator Services: $320. This includes some help with table settings and end of night duties.

Venue security: $330

Officiant: Free. Family friend.

Marriage license: $21

Venue insurance: $313

Rehearsal dinner: $350 for 15 people. We are catering BBQ.

Wedding day brunch for wedding party: $200. Charcuterie boards, sandwiches, coffee, & fruit. 

DJ: $822

Violinist: $810. She will play the ceremony and cocktail hour. This is a big splurge for us. 

Linen rentals: $733. This includes all flatware and linens.

Catering: $3,535. This was a STEAL! Other quotes were double this. This rate includes non alcoholic drinks, passed appetizers, salads, rolls, entree with two sides, and a full dessert bar. This includes all vendor meals and all tips for servers. 

Coffee bar: $600. Full service lattes for 100 guests with a customized menu and customized cups with our wedding logo included! Two baristas included for two hours of service.

Florals: $890. This includes my bouquet, three bridesmaids bouquets, 11 centerpieces, and eight boutonnières. We are using H‑E‑B for this service!

Photograpy and Videography: $2,300. We got another great deal on this one. This includes our engagement session, 9 hours of photography on our wedding day, and 3 hours of videography for the ceremony and part of the reception.

Decor: $500 give or take a little. Signage, table numbers, guest book, etc. We are using a mix of Canva and a local printing company.

Invitations & thank you cards & postage: $250

Suit with tailoring, belt, and dress shoes: $650 

My dress: $900 from David’s Bridal.

Alterations: The total cost is between $550 - $750. This one was a huge sticker shock for me! I’m waiting for my final appointment for the final cost.

Photo Booth: $500 for two hours. Includes prints!

Wedding Party Gifts: $250

That’s everything! I know it’s not under $10k but I’m very proud of how it’s all come together and the deals we’ve managed to find for such great prices. We are hoping for a beautiful and memorable event with those we love. 💕 💕💕

TLDR; Managed to get all professional vendors for our 90 guest wedding for around $20k! 🎉🎉🎉

- She sleeps with the windows open, but has a quilt her cousin made if he gets cold
- she'd prefer the light left on (it's not that bright)
- the bathroom mirror has is embarrassingly cracked

- maybe he could change her life

Starting weight: 250 lbs
Current Weight: 225 lbs
Goal Weight: 185 lbs 

Currently on a big health kick after a year of being totally out of it and gaining close to 60 lbs. 

I’m exercising at least twice a day (light-to-medium weight training and an outdoor activity like a walk/kayak trip/hill hike) 

I’m eating a fairly consistent diet of the following:

4 AM: 4 Teaspoons Metamucil, followed by 32 oz of water 

9 AM: Coffee and Regular Half & Half 

Noon: Whole Avocado and Tuna/Quinoa Packet 

6:30 PM: 1 lb slow cooked Mexican chicken, 3 oz sour cream, 1 whole avocado 

8 PM: 2 scoops Protein Powder / 4 teaspoons of Metamucil (I’m aware this is a lot of Metamucil, but I get absurdly constipated on this diet without it) 

I drink at least a gallon and a half of water daily, while supplementing at night with:
Zinc
Collagen 
Magnesium 
Multivitamin

I also use cocoa butter lotion 3-4 times a week 

I’ve been maintaining a 2k+ calorie deficit a day for 6+ weeks now and have lost right at 25 lbs while gaining quite a bit of muscle (on my legs in particular)

As I’m getting in better shape, I am noticing the calories are getting a little harder to burn, so I’m hoping I can stick on my current regiment and avoid losing this weight too quickly. 

What do you guys think? Is loose skin inevitable if you’re going to drop 60 lbs quickly? Or is there a way to have my cake and eat it too?

In 2023 I (17 F, at the time 16) was asked out by the ex bf (we'll call Dan 17 M, 16 at the time)of a casual friend in my class (we'll call Ellen 18 F). He and her had not been serious and only dated for 3 months, at the time of this they had been broken up for 7 months and we were about a month into the new school year and Dan and Ellen were on good terms.

 I did have slight feelings for Dan at the time (was not at all interested while he was dating Ellen) but was caught off guard when he asked me to get coffee with him.I wanted to go but at the time I didn't know him that well and my friendship with Ellen was more important, so i told him I'd get back to him. I asked Ellen and was totally up front with her and said that really genuinely i would rather be her friend than get coffee with a boy and that if it would make her resent me or hurt her in any way, then I would completely understand and i would tell him no. When she had decided she told me that it was not her decision to make, but that she really wants the best for me and that he seemed to be doing better since their breakup and she would not resent me at all if i decided to pursue anything with him.

 So, i went out with Dan for coffee and we ended up dating for over a year and were very serious and taking our relationship into consideration when contemplating serious life decisions. Throughout this time, Ellen slowly stopped talking to me completely and i later found out from mutual friends that it was indeed because of my relationship with Dan. I completely understand her feeling this way, but it does seem unfair that I have her the opportunity to say that before i was attached to him and she told me i had nothing to worry about, just for her to resent me to the point of ignoring me. 

In October 2024 i gave her a letter essentially saying that i was sorry that i hurt her and that if i had known in the moment that my actions would hurt her, I wouldn't have done it and that i had thought that since they were on good terms and i asked her how she felt, then it wasn't breaking ""girl code"". She didn't reply to this letter. Then, on December 4, 2024, long story short Dan broke up with me with no clear reasons but has since shown some signs of being back in a poor mental state, but we don't have to dig into that too much.

 As can be imagined, i have been devastated the past almost 3 months and going to school has been very hard without crying in the bathroom every other period. Shortly AFTER our breakup, Ellen gave me a response letter essentially saying that we can be friends and that she just wants the best for me. Since then however, she has been constantly talking to Dan in a decisively flirty way whenever he approaches her. She would then complain about this and tell mutual friends that she wishes he would leave her alone, but now INTENTIONALLY starts conversations with him and puts herself in positions to talk to him one on one. Going to school and not talking to Dan has been hard enough, but watching his ex talk to him constantly in a flirty way genuinely makes it almost impossible to get through the day. 

Ellen has also overheard me sobbing to my mother about the situation and has made eye contact with me while talking to him as tears are streaming down my face. She is well aware that i still have strong feelings for him  and that I do not like her talking to him as often as she does, yet she has made no changes and still continues to complain about him ""bothering"" her. 

Do i think that Dan likes Ellen? No, they've talked often since freshman year since she's one of the only people who can keep up with his political conversations, so i think that's why he enjoys talking to her, even if it comes across as flirty sometimes. Do i think Ellen likes Dan? Not really, i think she enjoys the attention she is getting from him and she talks in a flirty way to most of the guys in our class, whether it's intentional or not. What bothers me is that she knows how upset i am about how often they talk and she knows how devastated i am about the break up and still does it directly in front of me intentionally.

 I think that she thinks we are on good terms now because of her response letter, i am courteous to her, but I absolutely despise her now. We are on good enough terms that I think I COULD maybeee have a conversation with her about it, but idk.
When they are talking it is literally instantaneous tears and I've missed so many classes because I cannot stop crying, it's a serious issue. I know that this is partly a me-problem and something I need to work on, but I also really want her to stop talking to him so much. It would benefit me a lot mentally, and even if she didn't listen, it would at least get my feelings out in the open. 
But we also have many mutual friends that have tried to explain away her behavior as her ""just being nice"" and I'm afraid that if I confront her I will create tension between myself and those friends, who are important to me, but closer to her.
So is it worth it to risk making drama and causing friction with my friends? Her actions are seriously affecting me mentally, which sounds very dramatic, but it hurts so much. If you think I should say something to her, how should I phrase it in the least problematic way?",1,1740626465.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

I was content with being a lurker until (what I hope is) the ""series finale"" of some drama in my life occurred about 2 days after I joined the sub-Reddit. That will be on another post that I'm currently collecting the receipts for and will share in another thread (it's going to be a loooong one). But I thought I'd dip my toe in with my worst dating stories first. So stay tuned 😉

For context (because we love the context) I am currently 29 (F) but these stories are from upwards of 10 years on this gawd-awful dating apps. I don't remember every encounter (because most weren't very memorable) but I'd like to share the worst from my online dating experience and why I want EVERY first date to be just coffee.. because HOW ARE THESE MEN NOT EMBARRASSED????? 

#3 - THE CATFISH
This guy's profile said that he was 6'3"", 27, and that he was a manager at the place he worked. We talked  over the app for about a week prior to deciding on when to meet up for coffee. He gave me weird vibes, (not creepy, just weird) and I asked a friend of mine to be on ""standby"" in case I needed an escape plan. When I say weird vibes, I mean he seemed really awkward at times and had weird responses to things, but he came off as genuinely sweet otherwise so I just took that as him being shy or maybe new to online dating. When I asked him questions about his job, he had really indirect answers. I thought that was weird but I still decided to go on the date. I'm relaying some of these weird messages to my friend and she decided she's going to go into the cafe ahead of time and be seated close by. I get to the cafe, get a drink, and take a seat. About 10 minutes later, a short, stout, and poorly dressed.. boy.. comes in. He was MAYBE 5'10"" (which I guessed based on the fact that I, a 5'8"" woman in 2 inch heels, was looking just over his head) which wouldn't be a big deal.. if also didn't lie about his age and job. Yep, this ""27 yo manager"" was actually a 23 yo sales representative. He even angled his photos on his profile to make himself look taller and his face look more structured. Idk how he expected to lie about all of these basic things and expect me to not call him out on it. I ended up leaving the date and sitting down with my friend instead. We just watched him walk out. 

#2 - THE SLOB
I'm going to preface this one by saying I have wayyy too much patience for my own good sometimes. This guy was pretty funny over conversation and seemed normal. Nothing spectacular, but normal was better than a lot of the other options on these sites. We set a date to go for coffee. Please note: I was dressed casually, but I was put together, since I make a effort to look good for these dates. We decided to meet for noon, I pull up, and he's not there. I get a text from him that his grandparents (whom he lived with) needed him home for about an hour to help with something. I didn't want to waste gas going home and back so I decided to do some shopping nearby while I waited. An hour passed, and he said he was still stuck helping out. And so, (yes, I know I should have just gone home at this point) I decided to bring some coffee to a friend of mine who worked in the area. We hung out for a bit while she had some free time. Then I did some grocery shopping, went to the bank, and ran some other errands.... 3 HOURS LATER.... He finally texts me that he's free. I pull up to the cafe and he pulls in shortly afterwards. We get out of our cars and start walking in.. now, this guy was the opposite of a catfish. He was exactly how he looks in his profile picture. EXACTLY. He was wearing the exact same outfit. A gross, torn, black zip-up sweater. A Graphic t-shirt with a stain on it. Black jeans that were torn at the hems from being stepped on. And the sneakers... the sneakers were the most worn down, holey, and dirty shoes I've ever seen. He had FOUR HOURS to make himself look like he hadn't just rolled out from under a bridge. I should have walked away, but then I wouldn't have gotten to learn about this guy's spending habits.. or lack thereof. I mentioned that I did some shopping while I waited and he told me he basically never buys new things. Specifically, he said he bought the sneakers he was wearing 10 years ago. Look, I'm all for not spending money unless needed, but when you have your big toe sticking out of your shoe, I think it'd be time to get new ones. After he talked about his shoes, he then spent the next 10 minutes talking about his most recent ex that he was clearly still hung up on. That's when my patience reached it's end and I left. 

#1 - THE WORST (you're not ready for this one)
 This was about 10 years ago right after I ended a terrible relationship and a friend of mine recommended this guy she knew. After showing me his pictures, she gave me his number and we texted for almost 2 weeks. He was engaging, asked lots of questions, seemed genuinely interested in me, and we got along. We decided to meet up. This was back when I was into jogging (definitely not into it anymore) and after I told him about it, he offered to join me on my next jog. So, the next day I got my athletic wear on, grabbed my sneakers and water bottle, and jogged over to where we decided to meet. I get there first and I wait a bit. He shows up and he's wearing jeans, a button down shirt, a corduroy jacket, and the shiniest dress shoes I've ever seen. He suggests we just go for a walk. Considering he was the one who suggested we go jogging together, I was expecting to, idk, actually go jogging. I would have been perfectly happy meeting somewhere and going for a coffee. On this walk, all he talked about was himself. Which wasn't all that exciting. He was an IT that worked from home and rarely went outside. That became apparent when 20 minutes into our walk, he complained his calves were burning. I offered for us to find somewhere to sit but he insisted we just turned around and did the 20 minute walk back, complaining the whole way. I could imagine that the expensive looking dress shoes weren't very comfortable to walk in for long periods of time... Anyways, we got back to where we first met and went to part our ways, when he tried to reach up and kiss me, and I ended up turning my cheek into it. I jogged home, told my mum about what happened, and then I got into the shower. While in the shower, I decided that I'm going to end things with this guy. I finish my shower, get out, towel down, and go back into my room, pick up my phone, and see the most disgusting, unbelievable text I've ever received in my life...

""So I was thinking about your VA*INA (😳) and how tight (🤢) it must be because you do all these walks and jogs and keeping active (🤮)."" 

There was more to it but I barely could get through the first part without wanting to throw up, so I think I've mentally blocked the rest. I simply replied with ""this isn't going to work out, thanks, have a good life."" to which he responds with ""IT'S BECAUSE I'M SHORT ISN'T IT?????"" (he was about 4 inches shorter than me) I was going to respond but decided to just block him instead. I relayed this whole thing to my friend who told me about him and it turns out, she never actually met the guy irl, just spoke with him over the internet. So, I told her the next time she wanted to match me with someone, she needed to at least meet him in person first LOL 


I wish I was making these up. But after 10 years of this BS, I'm more comfortable and happy being single. I'm in the best years of my life and I'm not about to let a man come in and ruin that for me. I do not chase, I attract, and the right person will come along when the time is right. As of last summer, I've deleted all of the dating apps and I'm focusing on being back in school, my career, and eventually buying my own house and living my best life!

1iz69en,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iz69en,First Time Dobie Owner!,"Hey everyone!

I do have other dogs, a Maltipoo and a Pitbull, but this is my first pure bred dog and first Doberman!  This is Coffee and I got her little under a month ago.  She is three months now and doing amazing.  She will mostly respond to name and recall, mostly good with potty training, has learned to sit, hand, lay down, twirl, is working on her impulse control, and slowly we’re integrating heel and safe!

My question now is with everything else 😅.  

I'd like to ask for tips on how to show her good manners in spite of what her big pittie brother tries to teach her.  They get along beautifully, better than expected, but they do also tend to be mischievous together.  Also, her teething phase is approaching and though I’ve tried to prepare with teething toys, freezing said toys, offering ice cubes, plenty of other toys and teaching bite inhibition, I’d like to get some tips and tricks from other Doberman owners, if possible.  I've also tried some mental stimulation, such as using meal times as training, putting some meals in a bottle, playing hide and seek, and hiding kibble beneath a cup(hasn't worked well😅), but I’d appreciate any other tricks or games I could try with my girl!

Really, I would appreciate advice about anything.  Anything is welcome!  And thank you for reading and responding!",21,1740626344.0,DobermanPinscher,3,0.96,False

In 2023 I (17 F, at the time 16) was asked out by the ex bf (we'll call Dan 17 M, 16 at the time)of a casual friend in my class (we'll call Ellen 18 F). He and her had not been serious and only dated for 3 months, at the time of this they had been broken up for 7 months and we were about a month into the new school year and Dan and Ellen were on good terms.

 I did have slight feelings for Dan at the time (was not at all interested while he was dating Ellen) but was caught off guard when he asked me to get coffee with him.I wanted to go but at the time I didn't know him that well and my friendship with Ellen was more important, so i told him I'd get back to him. I asked Ellen and was totally up front with her and said that really genuinely i would rather be her friend than get coffee with a boy and that if it would make her resent me or hurt her in any way, then I would completely understand and i would tell him no. When she had decided she told me that it was not her decision to make, but that she really wants the best for me and that he seemed to be doing better since their breakup and she would not resent me at all if i decided to pursue anything with him.

 So, i went out with Dan for coffee and we ended up dating for over a year and were very serious and taking our relationship into consideration when contemplating serious life decisions. Throughout this time, Ellen slowly stopped talking to me completely and i later found out from mutual friends that it was indeed because of my relationship with Dan. I completely understand her feeling this way, but it does seem unfair that I have her the opportunity to say that before i was attached to him and she told me i had nothing to worry about, just for her to resent me to the point of ignoring me. 

In October 2024 i gave her a letter essentially saying that i was sorry that i hurt her and that if i had known in the moment that my actions would hurt her, I wouldn't have done it and that i had thought that since they were on good terms and i asked her how she felt, then it wasn't breaking ""girl code"". She didn't reply to this letter. Then, on December 4, 2024, long story short Dan broke up with me with no clear reasons but has since shown some signs of being back in a poor mental state, but we don't have to dig into that too much.

 As can be imagined, i have been devastated the past almost 3 months and going to school has been very hard without crying in the bathroom every other period. Shortly AFTER our breakup, Ellen gave me a response letter essentially saying that we can be friends and that she just wants the best for me. Since then however, she has been constantly talking to Dan in a decisively flirty way whenever he approaches her. She would then complain about this and tell mutual friends that she wishes he would leave her alone, but now INTENTIONALLY starts conversations with him and puts herself in positions to talk to him one on one. Going to school and not talking to Dan has been hard enough, but watching his ex talk to him constantly in a flirty way genuinely makes it almost impossible to get through the day. 

Ellen has also overheard me sobbing to my mother about the situation and has made eye contact with me while talking to him as tears are streaming down my face. She is well aware that i still have strong feelings for him  and that I do not like her talking to him as often as she does, yet she has made no changes and still continues to complain about him ""bothering"" her. 

Do i think that Dan likes Ellen? No, they've talked often since freshman year since she's one of the only people who can keep up with his political conversations, so i think that's why he enjoys talking to her, even if it comes across as flirty sometimes. Do i think Ellen likes Dan? Not really, i think she enjoys the attention she is getting from him and she talks in a flirty way to most of the guys in our class, whether it's intentional or not. What bothers me is that she knows how upset i am about how often they talk and she knows how devastated i am about the break up and still does it directly in front of me intentionally.

 I think that she thinks we are on good terms now because of her response letter, i am courteous to her, but I absolutely despise her now. We are on good enough terms that I think I COULD maybeee have a conversation with her about it, but idk.
When they are talking it is literally instantaneous tears and I've missed so many classes because I cannot stop crying, it's a serious issue. I know that this is partly a me-problem and something I need to work on, but I also really want her to stop talking to him so much. It would benefit me a lot mentally, and even if she didn't listen, it would at least get my feelings out in the open. 
But we also have many mutual friends that have tried to explain away her behavior as her ""just being nice"" and I'm afraid that if I confront her I will create tension between myself and those friends, who are important to me, but closer to her.
So is it worth it to risk making drama and causing friction with my friends? Her actions are seriously affecting me mentally, which sounds very dramatic, but it hurts so much. If you think I should say something to her, how should I phrase it in the least problematic way?",1,1740626296.0,teenrelationships,1,1.0,False

1iz68qc,https://www.reddit.com/r/gallbladders/comments/1iz68qc/severe_middleofthenight_attacks_gallbladder/,Severe Middle-of-the-Night Attacks – Gallbladder? Pancreas? Something Else?,"Hi everyone—this is a long post, I know (and my first ever Reddit post!) but only because this has been happening for over 10 years now and I’m desperate for answers at this point. I’ve (27f) been experiencing these bizarre, terrifying episodes since I was around 14-15 years old, and I’m hoping someone here might recognize what’s going on. 

Doctors have brushed me off in the past, writing these episodes off as panic attacks. (One Dr even resorted to refilling my Xanax prescription, as I admittedly do have anxiety and panic attacks that I take Prozac for.) But I know my body, and this feels very physically triggered by some kind of internal event. After researching this (a whoooole lot), Ive recently begun to suspect it might be related to my gallbladder.

What Happens During an Episode:

	•	Almost always happens in the middle of the night—wakes me up from a dead sleep
	•	Sudden stabbing, squeezing, cramping pain in my upper abdomen (usually in the center that radiates throughout my abdomen)
	•	Pain comes in waves—so intense that it will take my breath away. I imagine it feels like birthing contractions almost?
	•	Chest pain that feels like it’s coming from the abdominal cramping (“cramping” as in the sensation of being stabbed with knives)
	•	Feels like I need to vomit or have diarrhea (which sometimes happens, mostly the diarrhea.)
	•	Excessive sweating—my whole body gets clammy and drenched, sweat will soak through my clothes. Literal beads of sweat drip down my skin. 
	•	Burning skin sensations… which feels hot yet cold? My body feels hot, like I’m overheating
	•	Shortness of breath and painful breathing, especially with deeper breaths
	•	Heart racing (feels like a panic attack but starts with pain, not fear)
	•	Feeling dizzy and lightheaded and weak, to the point that I get scared I might faint
	•	Feels vasovagal in nature—I feel so hot and overwhelmed that I always have to lie down on my back on the cool bathroom tile floor
	•	Shivering and feeling cold from the sweat after the worst of it passes
	•	The attack will suddenly stop, almost like flipping a switch, and then I feel weak and chilled afterward
	•	Episodes last about anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour approx., and I feel wiped out after

When & How Often It Happens:

	•	Episodes can be sporadic—sometimes I’ll have a couple close together, but will usually go months without one
	•	They’re pretty rare, but when they do happen, they feel severe. They probably happen 5 to 10 times per year.
	•	Almost always happens in the middle of the night and wakes me up

What Seems to Trigger It:

	•	Caffeine (or especially sugary, creamy coffee drinks—it’s worth noting that my first attacks in high school seemed to always happen after consuming those Dunkin’ Donuts’ frozen coffee drinks, I think they were called Mochachinos?) 
	•	Alcohol
	•	Heavy, creamy foods

One recent episode happened a couple hours after eating a giant bowl of gluten-free Alfredo pasta—I immediately felt nausea and abdominal discomfort, but the attack itself came a couple hours later. My boyfriend (who is currently applying to medical school, and who is extremely logical and isn’t easily shaken—especially after working in healthcare settings for several years) saw an episode for the first after this dinner and was very, very worried upon seeing me on the bathroom floor, where I was profusely sweating, in extreme pain, and was barely able to interact with him. He wanted to take me to the ER (I refused, I have white coat syndrome tbh. The irony, I know, what with my bf aspiring to become a doctor. But I knew from past experiences that the episode would eventually pass and ER was more than likely unnecessary.) And he gave me tums which (maybe a placebo effect?) did seem to maybe help ease the pain.. or at least encouraged a bowel movement.

What I’ve Been Told & My Fears:

	•	Doctors have dismissed it as panic attacks, presumably because I have a history of anxiety/panic disorder and take antidepressants for that
	•	But this feels like it starts physically, not mentally—the pain triggers the panic, not the other way around
	•	I sometimes get scared it’s a heart attack… and yes, I mean it: like an actual heart attack. The pain gets THAT severe, like emergency room-territory. Like I’m scared I’m dying. 
	•	I’ve wondered if it could be biliary colic (gallbladder attacks), bile sludge, pancreatitis, or something else? (I have a maternal “grand”-aunt who passed away from pancreatic cancer and who also had gallbladder issues.)

Between episodes, I’m fine. But I do have other health issues like:
-chronic digestive system issues like IBS (albeit, the ibs is self-diagnosed). I also have a class 3 or 4 wheat allergy (revealed after an IGE test) and haven’t tested for celiac, but I do try to avoid gluten and mostly feel better GI-wise when I am good about that. 
-Discovered I had a severe vitamin d deficiency my freshman year of college (the value was 13, I believe). I didn’t really start taking supplements again until this year when I tested again and found it was 28. Once I started taking supplements again, I found it made a huge difference for things like brain fog, feeling cold all the time, menstruation pain/migraines, sleep, etc. and just a general sense of well being.
-Frequently bloated. 
-This is gross, I know: but I also usually have yellow-brown colored/ mucus covered stool that will float and also holds a lot of undigested food bits. 5 to 6 on Bristol scale. 
-My TSH also goes into “hypo” territory sometimes, highest it’s been (that I know of) is 5.25. My mom is diagnosed with Hashimotos.
-Bouts of constipation and then periods of diarrhea. 
-Experience nights sweats rather regularly, where it soaks through my clothes (similarly to when I experience these episodes). I have also wondered if maybe these episodes are hot flashes and are maybe hormone related? 

All of this said, I’m in the process of trying to find a doctor who will 1) take me seriously and 2) who I feel comfortable with—but for my own peace of mind, has anyone experienced something similar? Could this be gallstones, bile sludge, pancreatitis, something else?  I’ve been dismissed each time I’ve brought it up to a provider, which granted I haven’t done much anyway, but this dismissiveness makes me feel like I’m crazy… I really want to get to the bottom of it finally. Would love to hear from anyone who’s been through something like this!

1iz63rt,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1iz63rt/messy_situation_with_a_sortof_friend_and_my_ex/,messy situation with a sort-of friend and my ex,"This is a very long situation to explain, but I am very much in need of help and any advice would be so so appreciated. In 2023 I (17 F, at the time 16) was asked out by the ex bf (we'll call Dan)of a casual friend in my class (we'll call Ellen). He and her had not been serious and only dated for 3 months, at the time of this they had been broken up for 7 months and we were about a month into the new school year and Dan and Ellen were on good terms.

 I did have slight feelings for Dan at the time (was not at all interested while he was dating Ellen) but was caught off guard when he asked me to get coffee with him.I wanted to go but at the time I didn't know him that well and my friendship with Ellen was more important, so i told him I'd get back to him. I asked Ellen and was totally up front with her and said that really genuinely i would rather be her friend than get coffee with a boy and that if it would make her resent me or hurt her in any way, then I would completely understand and i would tell him no. When she had decided she told me that it was not her decision to make, but that she really wants the best for me and that he seemed to be doing better since their breakup and she would not resent me at all if i decided to pursue anything with him.

 So, i went out with Dan for coffee and we ended up dating for over a year and were very serious and taking our relationship into consideration when contemplating serious life decisions. Throughout this time, Ellen slowly stopped talking to me completely and i later found out from mutual friends that it was indeed because of my relationship with Dan. I completely understand her feeling this way, but it does seem unfair that I have her the opportunity to say that before i was attached to him and she told me i had nothing to worry about, just for her to resent me to the point of ignoring me. 

In October 2024 i gave her a letter essentially saying that i was sorry that i hurt her and that if i had known in the moment that my actions would hurt her, I wouldn't have done it and that i had thought that since they were on good terms and i asked her how she felt, then it wasn't breaking ""girl code"". She didn't reply to this letter. Then, on December 4, 2024, long story short Dan broke up with me with no clear reasons but has since shown some signs of being back in a poor mental state, but we don't have to dig into that too much.

 As can be imagined, i have been devastated the past almost 3 months and going to school has been very hard without crying in the bathroom every other period. Shortly AFTER our breakup, Ellen gave me a response letter essentially saying that we can be friends and that she just wants the best for me. Since then however, she has been constantly talking to Dan in a decisively flirty way whenever he approaches her. She would then complain about this and tell mutual friends that she wishes he would leave her alone, but now INTENTIONALLY starts conversations with him and puts herself in positions to talk to him one on one. Going to school and not talking to Dan has been hard enough, but watching his ex talk to him constantly in a flirty way genuinely makes it almost impossible to get through the day. 

Ellen has also overheard me sobbing to my mother about the situation and has made eye contact with me while talking to him as tears are streaming down my face. She is well aware that i still have strong feelings for him  and that I do not like her talking to him as often as she does, yet she has made no changes and still continues to complain about him ""bothering"" her. 

Do i think that Dan likes Ellen? No, they've talked often since freshman year since she's one of the only people who can keep up with his political conversations, so i think that's why he enjoys talking to her, even if it comes across as flirty sometimes. Do i think Ellen likes Dan? Not really, i think she enjoys the attention she is getting from him and she talks in a flirty way to most of the guys in our class, whether it's intentional or not. What bothers me is that she knows how upset i am about how often they talk and she knows how devastated i am about the break up and still does it directly in front of me intentionally.

 I think that she thinks we are on good terms now because of her response letter, i am courteous to her, but I absolutely despise her now. We are on good enough terms that I think I COULD maybeee have a conversation with her about it, but idk.
When they are talking it is literally instantaneous tears and I've missed so many classes because I cannot stop crying, it's a serious issue. I know that this is partly a me-problem and something I need to work on, but I also really want her to stop talking to him so much. It would benefit me a lot mentally, and even if she didn't listen, it would at least get my feelings out in the open. 
But we also have many mutual friends that have tried to explain away her behavior as her ""just being nice"" and I'm afraid that if I confront her I will create tension between myself and those friends, who are important to me, but closer to her.
So is it worth it to risk making drama and causing friction with my friends? Her actions are seriously affecting me mentally, which sounds very dramatic, but it hurts so much. If you think I should say something to her, how should I phrase it in the least problematic way?",1,1740625839.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

Zuman stood there, frozen in shock. Piles of books lay scattered around the cottage and the once neatly cleaned sofa was now marred with strange black stains. A stench of rotten eggs emanated from the open fridge, where the food was replaced by an assortment of shirts, jeans, gloves and socks. 

The front door was open, hanging on its hinges while the floor itself was flooded with dirty green water. Zuman couldn’t wrap his head around what had happened but after dealing with strange stuff like this for a week now, he was rather frustrated. As Zuman stood in the chaotic cottage, his mind drifted back to two months ago, when it all began.



**28th May 2009,**



Zuman Mihran had just graduated from West Bengal’s college, ready to pursue his dream of becoming a software engineer. However, the next day he received a letter from his grandfather that completely shattered his plans. 

The letter explained that his grandfather was going out of town for a while and he did not expect to return before atleast a month. Therefore, Zuman would have to look after his grandfather’s ranch in Texas which was on the other side of the globe.

“Zuman crumpled the letter in his hand, his stomach sinking. He had never been close to his grandfather, a man his family often called ‘crazy.’ The thought of spending a month on the ranch felt like a prison sentence. Part of the reason why Zuman had not visited him in years was a result of his grandfather being extremely superstitious and prejudiced. The worst part was the fact that he his age was now nearing 102 which was simply astounding, and also unfortunate for Zuman’s part.

But now that his grandfather had gone away, Zuman’s father insisted he should go to Texas. Zuman had practically begged him to change his mind. “Dad, I can’t spend a month shoveling cow dung. I just graduated. I need to find a job.” , he said but he got the same reply every time, “Zuman, its an opportunity you should not pass. Its only for a month anyway. It won’t kill you.”

Zuman reluctantly said goodbye to all of his family members, including his mother who lay beneath a tombstone, gone when he was only two. His mother had always wanted him to become an engineer but that possibility seemed to be quite far away at the moment.

Soon, he was sent to the ranch, in Texas. 

The ranch comprised of a large wheat field , a sizable pasture, two barns and a cottage. Out of these, Zuman was most interested in the cottage, hoping that it was well maintained. At first, he was actually quite impressed with the place. Although small, the kitchen was clean and had a nice assortment of wooden cabinets with polished handles that gleamed in the light. The bedroom was spacious, with a comfy, cushioned bed and hanging ceiling lights that cast a luxurious glow across the room. The basement was completely empty and dirty, with cobwebs and dust scattered all around the room.

Zuman spent the next couple of days getting accustomed to the environment, learning how to look after the cows and sheep. Thankfully he was not quite alone here; a dog named “Blake” was also with him, he was specifically used to herd the sheep. Zuman felt bad for him; it was evident that his grandfather had not taken care of him considering the malnourished body and its frightened demeanor. Zuman had fed him well and tended to some of his wounds, trying to lift his spirits. Fortunately, he was already looking better than he did.

Although the cottage was clean and maintained, the barns were in a very poor condition and all of the animals in there were smeared with dirt. Their bodies were thin, with their bones popping through the skin, clearly showing signs of starvation. 

“The old fool kept the luxury to himself!” he muttered, looking at the animals forced to live in the horrible environment. His heart was moved by their pleading looks and he decided to clean the entire ranch. Zuman went out of his way to clean up both the exterior and interior of the barn. Despite regretting the cow dung cleanup, he felt very accomplished once the job was done and the barns looked as good as new.

The next day, Zuman decided to go through some of the cabinets inside his room, checking if anything entertaining was there. The lack of a television and internet was driving him crazy thus, forcing him to rely on books. But the books that lay around the house were all strange religious books, with a crap ton of strange scribbles riddled on the pages. “The man was truly cracked,” he said, going through the cabinets, revealing even more religious books. All of this angered Zuman so much that he decided to throw all of the books away. He started to get rid of the books one by one until the pile of books revealed one diary, much cleaner than the other books and one which showed clear signs of use whether it be the cracked spine, creased and yellow pages or the stained cover.

Zuman curiously opened it, only a single page was brimmed with writing, the rest remained empty. The date was written as follows , “15/06/09”. The very first paragraph sent shivers down his spine, “By order of the harvester, ye must submit seventeen souls to him. Fail to do so and you will be killed. We won’t accept sheep anymore; we need human flesh.” 

With each line, Zuman’s heart fastened its pace, pounding aggressively. Below the first paragraph lay a strange symbol; a large scythe with blood dripping from its tip, below it lay a seemingly lifeless body of a human, one that had a striking resemblance to his grandfather. Zuman immediately threw the diary into the blazing fireplace, letting it turn into ashes as he stared, horrified by the contents of the diary. “What did it mean by ‘harvester’?”. Zuman let that thought aside before retiring to sleep.

A strange dream swirled through his mind that night, one that he would never forget till the end of his days; Visions of the cottage’s interior flashed in his mind, only instead of being clean and arranged, everything was scattered and although he could not make out the other odd things laid on the floor, he definitely noticed a dead animal. What it was, he could not guess but it was evident that it had been torn apart, with blood leaking from its exposed gut, worms munching on its brains while flies buzzed over it.

Zuman immediately got up from his slumber, panting heavily. His heart was beating against his rib cage and his mind kept flashing the gory image in front of him. He looked at his alarm clock, its numbers flashing : “3:25”. Suddenly, he heard Blake's barks echoing from outside. 

Grabbing his flashlight, Zuman stepped outside, the chill biting into his skin. He could see Blake's silhouette in the distance,  his barks getting increasingly louder. He rushed to Blake, noticing how his eyes were widened, his tail curled up under his body. Blake trotted close to his side, his growls turned into whimpers and tears emanated from Blake’s eyes. The barn in front of them stood menacingly, with its door hung open, its movement sluggish despite the absence of wind.

“Anyone there?” Zuman called, his voice faltering. The only response was the rhythmic creak of the door. Zuman turned towards Blake. “What's the matter buddy?” 

Blake only returned a whimper with widened eyes. He kept glancing towards the barn.

Zuman let out a sigh. Plucking up his courage, he stepped inside, the beam of his flashlight sweeping across the barn. The animals were eerily still, their eyes wide and fixed on the far corner. All of them were breathing raspily, as if they had seen something out of this world. 

The hair on the back of Zuman’s neck prickled as he moved closer, his boots crunching on scattered hay.

Suddenly, a PIt Pat echoed from behind. Jerking himself towards the direction, his heart missed a beat. He could have sworn that he saw something there.

The flashlight flickered. Zuman froze as he noticed something in the corner—a dark, shifting shape among the hay. The air felt heavier, pressing against him like a weight. Slowly, the pile moved, and something rolled out onto the floor.



*Pit Pat*



The light flickered again, revealing a glimpse of it, a strange figure, its edges dark and uneven. Zuman couldn’t make sense of it, but a deep chill ran through him. A whisper followed, low and cold, curling around him like smoke: “You shouldn’t have burned it.” Zuman let out a gasp and fell to the floor, his flashlight breaking from the impact. Blake barked behind him, the sound sharp and panicked.

Zuman whipped out his phone, his heart beats matching the *Pit Pats* echoing around him. He fumbled around the phone's interface and turned on the torch. 

When the light flickered back on, the corner was empty. The barn was still, yet Zuman’s skin crawled. On the ground where the object had been was a single, scorched page. Shaking, he leaned closer to read the dark, jagged writing: “The Harvester is watching.”

Blake barked again, snapping Zuman from his trance. Without hesitation, he bolted from the barn, slamming the door behind him. The stillness outside was no less suffocating than the darkness inside.

Back in the safety of the cottage, Zuman leaned against the door, his breath uneven. He glanced back at the barn. Something was there, something waiting—and it wasn’t going to leave him alone. “Screw this shit! What did the old fool get himself into? Why do I have to deal with this? Hmph! I ain't going back in there again, not until I have some protection.”

He had no choice but to return to the house and expect a quiet sleep, but that was quite impossible after what had happened. He had also picked up his grandfather’s old rifle from the basement, putting it on the nightstand. “I ain’t risking anything.”

Blake got up on the bed and curled himself on his lap. Zuman’s unease evaporated instantly, the comfort of Blake’s presence allowed him to sleep through that night although the same couldn’t be said for the rest.

The next day, while he was busy tending to his sheep, the neighbor came to pay a visit. She was an old lady, her face quite beautiful despite her age. “My boy, I see that you are taking care of the ranch quite well!” she said looking at the now restored ranch and smiling. 

Blake barked in approval, receiving a pat from the lady. She nodded before saying, “You’ve really spruced the place up, Zuman! Your grandfather sure left you a lot of work” she said, her smile transforming into a frown. “Cracked he was, utterly cracked!”.

Zuman let out a dry chuckle, “Thanks, and yes he was always a bit…different, to put it lightly.”

“My boy,” she said, scanning for any eavesdroppers around her before saying, “Forgive an old woman for prying, but every June, your grandpa used to vanish from town for a while, going off to god knows where. And every time he came back, he always brought about a dozen books with him, all religious ones.”

“Religious books?” Zuman muttered, stroking his chin. “I did find a lot of religious books lying around the whole cottage. It is quite skeptical, but again, maybe he just got some strange pleasure from reading religious books.”

Zuman knew very well that it was not the case. Knowing his grandfather, he was sure there was something more sinister behind his motives.

The lady let out a grim chuckle before saying, “I wish it was that simple, but books were not the only thing that went into the house. I saw him, you know. Slaughtering sheep, dragging them inside. And after that…” Her voice dropped to a near whisper. “I’d see flashing lights. Hear screams. You don’t know how chilling it was to see that sight.”

A long silence followed, leaving Zuman to wonder about the whole ordeal. Many questions were gliding around his mind. Frankly, he was not sure what to think of all of this. He had always disliked his grandfather, but he hadn’t expected him to do such a thing. Moreover, could he really trust this lady?

“My advice?” the lady said, raising her voice. “Don’t meddle with his strange affairs. Keep yourself out of trouble.”

“I will keep that in mind,” Zuman nodded, his voice wavering as he spoke. The worst part was the fact that this story fit seamlessly into the prospect of the diary that he had found. He let his thoughts aside before turning back to the lady, “Would you like to join me for supper tonight? I’d appreciate some company and perhaps we could talk more about this.”

The lady’s face softened, and she smiled gently. “Of course, my boy. I’ll bring over some of my stew. We can discuss more then.”

“Thank you. I’ll see you this evening,” Zuman replied, feeling a mix of relief and apprehension.

Later that evening, she came over with a pot of her delicious stew. During supper, Zuman had got to know the neighbor’s name, that being Olivia. They had chatted for a while, discussing the affairs around the town, with Zuman receiving many compliments from Olivia regarding his well done job of maintaining the ranch. Zuman was quite cheerful after eating the delicious stew that Olivia had made.

 For a moment, he managed to push aside his worries about the harvester and enjoy the warmth of her company. But as the night wore on, his questions resurfaced, and he knew he needed to get more answers. Still, he forcefully pushed them aside thinking, “I really do not need more things to worry about. Why did the old fool get into this mess? He could have saved me a lot of questions.”

As the first week passed, Zuman found a rhythm. The ranch began to prosper under his care, the animals looked healthier, and even Blake’s spirit seemed lifted. Even Olivia had helped him with taking care of the sheep when he was tired. She even cooked him dinner during the night. They had developed a mother-son relationship quickly with their bond strengthening every day. Many uneventful days passed until the arrival of **13th June 2009**, a date which changed the course of everything.



It had been a normal morning for Zuman, trimming the wool off of the sheep before tending to the cows. He did not forget to clean Blake’s kennel and feed him. After all that was done, he decided to take a little rest inside the cottage. As he was about to walk in, the barks of Blake echoed through the air, coming from the ranch’s gate. Zuman looked into the distance before spotting Blake barking at a man outside the ranch. Zuman immediately grabbed the old rifle from the house and hurried towards the gate

Zuman eyed the strange man wearing a brown trench coat and sunglasses. Zuman was confused by his attire which he thought absurdly resembled a mafia member from a 70’s movie. The man stepped forward before speaking with a heavy Peruvian accent, “Where is the old man?”

“He isn’t here; the ranch belongs to me now. What is your purpose?”

The man eyed Zuman warily, scanning his facial features. He kept glancing at the rifle, but not in fear. “Here or not, I come to deliver him a message,” the man said, pulling out an envelope from his pocket and handing it out to him. “It is from the harvester as you probably know”

“The harvester? Who is he?” Zuman asked but the man scurried off into the distance without a reply. Frustrated with the whole ordeal, Zuman muttered, “What has the old fool got himself into?”

Zuman grappled with the decision to open the letter for a long time. Eventually curiosity got the best of him and he opened the letter. His heart skipped a beat as he read the small message. “The ides of June grow near and so do I. You better have prepared yourself old man, I need you to pay your debt. I need you to give me a soul. – THE HARVESTER “

He couldn’t sleep later that night, the dream from before kept invading his slumber. This time, Blake’s presence was not enough. Unanswered questions kept gnawing at his mind. “The sheep, the books, the debt. What does it all mean?”. He now hoped that he had not thrown the diary away. Maybe he could have got some answers from it. “I need answers, but who can I trust? Olivia seems to know something, but how much will she share?”

Unable to contain his curiosity, he decided to pay Olivia a visit next day, hoping that she knew something about the matter. The countdown for the ides of June began.



**14th June 2009**



Zuman got up early that day, rushing off to Olivia’s house. “Sit down, my boy” she said, letting him inside the house and pointing towards an armchair. Although Olivia had been to Zuman’s cottage quite a few times, Zuman hadn’t got the same privilege till now. They chat around for a while, talking about general things. 

Despite his growing unease, Zuman hesitated to tell Olivia about the whole ordeal. He feared she might dismiss him as crazy. Soon his impatience crept in and he blurted out, “Olivia, I must ask you something. Do you know anything about someone called the harvester?”

Olivia’s eyes widened and she immediately said, “Harvesters? My boy, there are so many harvesters here that I do not know which one you are talking about.” But it was quite clear from her wavering voice that it was a lie. She knew exactly what he was talking about.

“You know of what I speak,” Zuman said, his heart racing. “It has been troubling me ever since I got here.” He proceeded to explain all of his findings from start to end, his encounter with the stranger and also about the letter. Olivia patiently listened although it was evident from her deep breaths that what she had heard was not good.

“You have got yourself into great trouble,” she began, wiping the sweat off her forehead. ”The harvester is not a harvester of crops or animals; It or should I say he, is the harvester of souls. You have probably figured that out by now. Many tales and legends circulate around the harvester in our town, with many regarding him to be death himself, for he only appears when a person is destined to die.” A long silence followed, only broken by the loud thumping of Zuman’s heart.

Eventually, he broke the silence, “That sounds… unreal. But with everything I’ve seen, I believe it. What should I do?”

She got up and brought back a newspaper clipping, its title reading, “The truth about the harvester.” Not much information was present other than what Olivia had just told him. “But how did that old fool get linked with all this?” he said quietly but Olivia overheard her.

“Now I had always suspected that your cracked grandfather was meddling in affairs that he should not be,” she continued in a grim voice.”From your story, it is quite evident that your grandfather has found a way to cheat death and death ain't happy. But much of this is a riddle and one that does not seem to have any answer.”

All of this information only made Zuman more anxious. “Listen, my boy,” Olivia said, putting her hand on his shoulder in a kind manner. “Don’t be afraid! I have spent my whole youth studying these myths and legends of old and I must give you this advice; get out while you still can, for the harvester does not play fair and there is no way to move him with words. I suggest you leave in the early morning tomorrow.”

“But I can’t just leave. What about Blake and all the other animals? What about you?”

“I know it’s hard, but your life is worth more than this ranch. Go, Zuman. Go before it’s too late. Do not worry about me.”

Zuman left Olivia’s house, all drenched in sadness. He had to go or he wouldn’t live to see another day. But that meant saying goodbye to the ranch, the animals and of course Blake. He just could not bear to leave him there when there was such a big threat looming over the ranch, poised to strike at any moment.

As Zuman walked through the fields, memories flooded his mind, moments shared with Olivia, times spent caring for Blake and the other animals. Approaching the cottage, he noticed something unusual: the door hung off its hinges.



**The Present**



His hands trembled as he pushed the door aside, proceeding into the house. As soon as he stepped inside, his shoes were immediately soaked by the dirty green water flooding the floor. More absurdly, the kitchen was a complete mess, with plates shattered on the ground, cabinets all broken and the sink open, water pouring out of it every passing moment. 

Zuman let out a yell before hurrying to turn off the sink. His heart pounded as he started to make his way towards the bedroom. The living room sofa was marred with black stains while the fridge was now open, with its contents replaced by old socks, jeans and shirts that belonged to his grandfather. He stood among the chaos, simply frozen in shock. “Where is Blake?” he suddenly thought, recognizing the lack of barks.

Feeling fear grasp him, he shouted, “Blake, where are you boy?”. He did not care about the disarray anymore, his mind was completely focused on finding Blake. “Where are you?” he kept shouting with each shout more desperate than the other.

Eventually he arrived inside the bedroom, and he instantly dropped to his knees; Blake lay there with his body torn apart in half, worms wriggled through his torn gut as flies swarmed the remains. Zuman sat there silently, tears pouring out of his eyes. There was a long silence before he broke off into tears, his cries echoing through the air. “No, not like this” he kept crying, banging his head against the wall. He stopped crying however, after he noticed a note on the nightstand. The handwriting was clear, written with blood which Zuman hoped was not Blake’s.

“I warn ye for the last time. Do not run away again or you will face the consequences!” and beneath this sentence was the signature. “THE HARVESTER “

Before he could think about anything else, the alarm rang off by itself. Its loud ringing was followed by a loud boom which reverberated through the air. Zuman looked out of the window and his heart burst.

Olivia’s house was on fire, smoke fuming from the now, decrepit house. Zuman could not believe his eyes, it felt like his whole world had come crashing down in a matter of minutes. “What did I do to deserve this?” he thought, wiping off tears.”Curse the harvester” He looked back at the alarm clock, its display clearly showing 00:02. It was now the ides of June.

His crying stopped as the realization hit him like a truck. He was the payment. This was all a set up. His grandfather used him to pay his debt. And now it was the ides of March. He just sat there for a few minutes.

But he did not run, no. He did not pack his bags to leave or try to hide. He went straight down to the pastures, sitting on the grass. “Curse that old fool!” he said, his eyes moving to a shadow in the distance.

A tall lean figure materialized in the distance. It seemed to float above the grass, not disturbing a single speck of dust. Its head was large, with jagged sharp teeth jutting out of its huge jaw. Its long arms hanged from his body and on it was a huge scythe, big enough to slice Zuman in half yet, Zuman did not move

The figure stopped short, studying Zuman’s figure. Zuman got up from the grass and glared at the harvester, in his eyes gleamed a raging fury. He tightened his fists and said, “Tell me, harvester. Why have you taken everything from me? Why do you destroy my life?”

“My debt needs to be settled, fool! Your grandfather had avoided me for years and I won’t return empty-handed again. It is nothing personal,” it hissed, the high-pitched voice screeching through the air.

“Now tremble before my wrath”, it said, changing its pitch to an extremely low one.

An eerie silence followed, only broken by the shriek of the cold breeze. Zuman took one step forward, maintaining eye contact with the entity. 

“I do not fear you. I do not wish for life any longer. Do what you came to do,” Zuman said before spitting at the harvester’s floating feet. The harvester’s sinister smile transformed into a frown, he hesitated for a while, recognizing Zuman’s courage.

“You defy me? Very well. You’ll meet your end with courage. It’s more than most can say.” it said before laughing eerily. Zuman spread out his arms and closed his eyes, recalling every happy memory on this ranch. “Any last words?”

Zuman hesitated for a moment and then said, “Make that old fool pay!”. The harvester let out a deep chuckle.

He thought to himself, “It was good while it lasted. Goodbye world, I'm going to see my mother.”

“Get on with it already.”, he said at last, taking a deep, long breath.

The harvester raised its scythe, before proceeding to tear Zuman in half, its laughter echoing through the otherwise silent night.



However, that was not the end.



Somewhere across the pacific, Zuman’s grandfather sipped a cup of coffee, relaxing on a yacht. Smiling grimly as the ides of June passed and he did not.

“Immortality is mine. My debt has been paid. Hail the one with the darkness, the harvester!”

His chuckle caught in his throat as he saw the harvester materializing in front of him.

“We meet at last,” the harvester said, drifting towards him with the scythe in hand. 

“But…w-why? M-my debt h-has been paid? I have given you all s-seventeen souls for my seventeen c-crimes?!”

“I am only here to fulfill your grandson’s last request. It is nothing personal,” the harvester chuckled, raising its scythe.

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I still owe her a whole lot of hell for it too and I plan on delivering it.... But we had more sweet moments that many of you didn’t see. This wasn’t Kissen. This was Rebecca. The Rebecca who teased me about my big mouth, had cute southern nicknames for me, checked on me after health tests were run, worried about the dates I went on & waited up on me. The Rebecca that would talk to me for hours about God as we went into our knowledge of scriptures together, that exchanged pics of the suppers we had made that night and recipes on easy desserts to make & who I would text when I went to a gas station and bought a Gold Peak Tea bc it was our favorite tea and I always think of her when I buy one. She would get SO tickled that I would text her a picture of my Gold Peak tea that I had bought. She loved that I had thought of her. She appreciates those small gestures, she always has. I miss the Rebecca that would cut up with me on the phone and we would laugh till we cried, that got super hyper on chocolate and coffee. The Rebecca that giggled and teased me over Trump and how I would get over politics. The Rebecca that would blow my phone up when I told her NOT to bc Trump was giving a speech. She loved to give me shit. We have laughed together, cried together and gone for each other’s throats. This is the Rebecca that I miss. I don’t miss Kissen. I miss REBECCA. I have gotten down on my face before God and begged for her life and to show her mercy & to give her the justice that she deserves. I am praying for divine intervention and a miracle. My friendship and what went on with Rebecca was always private. We kept it that way unless we went to war with each other. I wanted to share what we were like together OFF the app. Those in her circle know this to be true. I know that you are all still praying for her as am I. One of Rebecca’s favorite Bible verses as many of you know was Matthew 18:20. “For where two or three are gathered together in my name, I am there among them. She knows the power of prayer. She BELIEVES in that power of prayer with every fiber of her being. Honor her by praying for her. Love her thru prayer. It is the most purest, unadulterated form of love that you could show her…….she will KNOW we’re praying. The Holy Spirit will KNOW. She is a big believer in the Holy Spirit talking to her as am I. We do not really know the truth of her condition but God DOES. If you want to get to Rebecca…..go to her Heavenly Father. She will KNOW. Love y’all

## Why Choose Aluminum Camping Cookware?

*   **Excellent Heat Conductivity:** Aluminum heats up quickly and evenly, reducing cooking time and saving fuel.This is especially important when cooking in unpredictable weather conditions.

*   **Affordability:** Compared to titanium or stainless steel options, **affordable aluminum camping cookware** offers a great balance of performance and price.

## understanding Different Types of Aluminum Camping Cookware

not all **aluminum camping cookware** is created equal. Understanding the different types will help you make an informed decision:

*   **Raw aluminum:** Basic, untreated aluminum is lightweight but prone to scratching, denting, and reacting with acidic foods.Not generally recommended for camping.

*   **Anodized Aluminum:** This type of aluminum has undergone an electrochemical process that creates a hard, durable oxide layer on the surface. This makes **anodized aluminum camping cookware** more resistant to scratches, corrosion, and sticking. It’s a popular and reliable choice. Hard anodizing further enhances the durability, making it an excellent choice for rugged use.

*   **Non-Stick Aluminum:** Some **aluminum camping cookware** features a non-stick coating (usually Teflon or a similar material). This makes cooking and cleaning easier, especially for items like skillets and frying pans. However, non-stick coatings can be delicate and may degrade over time, especially with high heat. Some camping circles on Reddit have debated the teflon safety on a direct fire.

1iz5rno,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1iz5rno/lovebombing_in_friendships/,Lovebombing in friendships?,"I’ve experienced love bombing in a friendship. It’s always related to relationships but never friends. 
I developed a friendship with a new friend a few yrs ago. Me and her quickly became besties. Our kids would hang out all the time. She even told me I was the only person she would ever let babysit her kids. Which I did several times. She was so in love with my baby, always gifting her stuff and she always gave me words of affirmations! We were constantly sending each other funny videos and she responded to every one! She was the best. 

This was a slow burn. I noticed she was a bit flakey but I let this slide cause when we would finally meet we were talking again nonstop. I began to get annoyed though cause I realized she wasn’t telling me ahead of time that she wouldn’t be hanging out. She would tell me hours after the set time. And say something like “my phone was off”. And I know at times this was bs cause she is always on Instagram and once read my message on there but didn’t respond to my text about if she was still meeting me. This was weird but I let it slide several times. So red flags began to show. And if I’m being quite honest there were red flags during our better times and I ignored them. 

 Recently I noticed anything I would tell her she would disagree with me. I’ll send her videos and she would respond passive aggressively or negatively. We agreed to meet at the park and she didn’t show for 40 mins and when she showed she had brand new coffee in her hand like she took her sweet time all while telling me she was almost there. My last straw was her once again flaking on me. So I stopped initiating hangouts. I started sending less videos and she seemed to respond less. We would have days where we would catch up and those days were great. She began sending vidoes with a more controversial tone to it and when I would send back videos she told me “I’m not watching these videos”. So I told her simply don’t watch it. And we haven’t spoken in over 2 months. 

I come to a conclusion that this is so similar to love bombing and I don’t understand why. Has anyone else experienced this with a friend?

1iz5m2t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Key_Intelligence_/comments/1iz5m2t/what_are_china_intelligence_priorities/,What Are China Intelligence Priorities?,"China’s intelligence prioritizes energy security and cyber sovereignty: the China-Kazakhstan oil pipeline switches to a backup oil source in 60 seconds, and Qingdao’s underground oil storage can support the country’s oil consumption for 15 days; Hangzhou data center deploys “Tai Chi Defense” to intercept 3 million DDoS attacks per second, and the digital RMB smart contract has cut off 23% of cross-border money laundering routes, and the mass production yield of 7-nanometer chips has exceeded 82%.

# Chip War

In 2023, a wafer factory was brightly lit at two o’clock in the morning, and engineers stared at the yield curve of the 28-nanometer production line, which suddenly plummeted to 62%. This scene is like a replay of the ASML lithography machine being stuck in the neck that year-China’s semiconductor industry is experiencing the bloodiest secret war. The latest entity list of the US Department of Commerce has locked the process below 16 nanometers, but SMIC has used DUV stacking technology to make 7-nanometer chips, which is more magical than the two bombs and one satellite back then.

This war is fighting the lifeline of the supply chain. The purchasing director of a memory chip factory in Wuhan showed me their emergency plan: the inventory of key spare parts is accurate to the piece, and even the air pump seal ring is prepared for three years. When Japan stopped supplying photoresist, their workshop used domestic materials for experiments, and scrapped wafers worth two private jets before they found the way. Now the yield rate of Yangtze Memory’s 232-layer NAND flash memory has caught up with Samsung, relying on this kind of experience gained with real money.

EDA software is the real bottleneck. Just like you can’t draw precise drawings without AutoCAD, chip design is impossible without tools like Synopsys. After Huawei was sanctioned, they circulated the operation of using the Cadence version 20 years ago to hard-code 5G base station chips. Now, although the interface of domestic EDAs such as Huada Jiutian looks like the Windows 98 system, it can already handle 14-nanometer design. A military unit even used it to reverse engineer the US military radar chip.

The most fatal thing is the competition for talent. Headhunters in Zhangjiang, Shanghai now clearly mark their prices: Engineers with experience in TSMC’s 5-nanometer mass production will receive a signing bonus that is equivalent to the down payment for a house in Pudong. A domestic equipment manufacturer is even more outrageous, inviting retired Japanese semiconductor technicians to be consultants, and paying them by the minute – these veterans can tell what is wrong with the ion implanter by just touching the vibration of the equipment.

# Belt and Road

The sound of the whistle of the cargo ship in the Strait of Malacca hides a game more complicated than chips. On the day of the trial operation of the Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway in Indonesia in 2024, local villagers rushed into the construction site holding a banner that read “Give me back my land”. This picture perfectly interprets the sweetness and bitterness of the Belt and Road. The money China has spent on this road is enough to buy all the listed companies in Vietnam, but what it gets in return is not just ports and railways.

Resource security is the real trump card of this road. The crude oil pipeline at Kyaukpyu Port in Myanmar can transport 22 million tons of oil every year, bypassing the Strait of Malacca, which is equivalent to China’s crude oil consumption for 10 days. In the monitoring room of a cobalt mine in Africa, Chinese engineers taught local security guards to use Dahua’s facial recognition system. They were not trying to prevent thieves, but commercial espionage by Western mining giants. These arrangements are more practical than any diplomatic rhetoric.

The debt trap is really a shame. In the Colombo Port City project, China actually played a trick – exchanging construction and operation rights for debt restructuring. Now the foreign exchange earned by this free trade zone for Sri Lanka is five times more than the port rent each year. Ethiopia’s Oriental Industrial Park is even more amazing. It directly taught locals to use TikTok to sell coffee beans. Last year, online sales increased sevenfold. This is not a debt trap, but clearly business enlightenment.

The Digital Silk Road is the hidden trick. Laos’ 5G base stations use Huawei Marine’s submarine optical cables, and the transmission speed is four thousand times faster than their previous dial-up Internet access. Thai rubber plantation owners now use Alibaba Cloud’s AI algorithm to predict production, with an accuracy rate 83% higher than praying to Buddha for divination. These digital infrastructures are like capillaries, delivering Chinese standards to the world.

In the security system of the presidential palace of an African country, Hikvision’s cameras and Tongfang Weishi’s security inspection machines form an iron wall; the payment system of an e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia is based on Ant’s blockchain technology – these invisible battlefields are the Terracotta Warriors of the new era.

# Military in the South China Sea

At four o’clock in the morning, a radar station in Fujian suddenly sounded a shrill alarm – the US EP-3 reconnaissance aircraft was playing “edge ball” close to the median line of the strait, and was only 16.8 nautical miles away from the baseline of our territorial waters at the closest point. This cat-and-mouse game is played more than 20 times a month. In a confrontation last year, our pilots used the J-16 to “bathe” the Australian P-8 maritime patrol aircraft, and the aluminum foil jammers were scattered like flowers from the sky.

The real powder keg in the South China Sea is underwater. In the port of Yongxing Island in Sansha City, there are more than 20 modified fishing boats parked all year round. These boats are equipped with seabed topographic mapping systems, and fishermen can find out the hydrological data while fishing. Last year, when a Vietnamese exploration ship wanted to cause trouble in Wan’an Bank, our 40 fishing boats directly set up a Bagua formation, forcing the other fleet to not dare to drop anchor for three days. Now the missile warehouses on the islands and reefs are hidden in the base of wind turbines, and the radar stations are disguised as seafood processing plants. This set of “military-civilian integration” gameplay makes satellite reconnaissance blind.

Legal battles are more dangerous than real swords and guns. The Philippine lawyers used Article 298 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea for arbitration, and we turned around and brought out the revised version of the Maritime Traffic Safety Law – now foreign ships entering the South China Sea must report their draft depth in advance, and this regulation has made the US military survey ship uncomfortable. What’s even more amazing is that when the Japanese merchant ship was seized last year, the reason used was “failure to handle ballast water in accordance with regulations”, and the International Maritime Organization’s terms were played better than the old captain of Tokyo Bay.

Fishermen are the real Great Wall on the sea. The old ship bosses in Tanmen Town, Qionghai, all have special navigation apps installed on their phones. When they encounter foreign warships, they turn on the “fishing mode” and the fleet automatically forms a human wall. During a confrontation last year, they used fishing nets to entangle the propeller of a US destroyer. The damage to the fishing nets was clearly listed in the subsequent claims list. These “maritime militias” wearing slippers are more difficult to deal with than regular troops.

# Anti-color revolution bottom line

The “free sour plum soup” incident that suddenly broke out in a university cafeteria turned into a gathering of thousands of people within three days – it was later found that it was a coupon issued by an overseas NGO through a campus food delivery platform. The color revolution has long since changed from a street battle to an algorithm attack and defense. Now the sensitive word library of university forums is updated every 6 hours, and even code words such as “Starbucks second cup half price” can be recognized.

The ideological defense line is being digitally reconstructed. The public opinion monitoring system developed by a Shenzhen technology company can predict mass incidents through the frequency of use of Weibo emoticons, with an accuracy rate 67% higher than traditional methods. During the Hong Kong amendment storm last year, this system warned of the Yuen Long conflict 48 hours in advance, and the special police team directly confiscated 3,000 laser pens at the subway entrance. Even more ruthless is the WeChat “circuit breaker mechanism” – when the discussion heat of a group exceeds the threshold, it automatically triggers a 30-second information delay, which is enough for the Internet police to lock down the leader.

Colleges and universities have become battlefields without gunpowder. The ideological and political courses of a 985 university now use virtual reality technology to restore the scene of the color revolution. Students wear VR glasses to experience the Kiev Square riots, which is more useful than watching the news broadcast a hundred times. The library database procurement is even more secretive. Last year, 20,000 “academic works” donated by a foreign foundation were intercepted, and the proportion of private goods in them was as high as 43%.

The economic defense line is the ultimate firewall. During the Xinjiang cotton incident, an e-commerce platform modified the algorithm overnight and automatically associated the “boycott” keyword with the patriotic product page, and the conversion rate soared 18 times. Even more extreme is the siege of NGO funds – now overseas remittances exceeding US$50,000 will trigger the “anti-money laundering circuit breaker”, and last year a certain environmental protection organization was intercepted. 38 million funds that were prepared to be used for street art.

Grassroots governance plays with “millimeter-level defense”. The “building thermometer” system set up by a community in Shanghai can detect suspicious people in the group tenants through abnormal water and electricity data. Last year, a foreign force tried to infiltrate through the pet community, but was discovered on the spot by the dog-walking intelligence network of grandpa and auntie – Auntie Wang’s golden retriever and the suspicious element’s corgi failed to mate, but instead became a breakthrough. This capillary-level prevention and control system makes it even more difficult for people to hide than Skynet cameras.

# Energy lifeline

At three o’clock in the morning, the pressure gauge of the oil pipeline on the China-Kazakhstan border suddenly soared red – the oil supply in the direction of Kazakhstan dropped by 60%, the dispatch center switched to the backup plan in seconds, and the oil storage tank group of Xinjiang Dushanzi Refinery automatically started the filling mode. The sensitivity of this energy nerve reflex arc is directly related to whether the national artery is blocked. When the United States sanctioned Venezuela last year, we launched the “Crude Oil Palette” plan overnight, blending Iranian heavy oil, Russian light oil and African crude oil in proportion, and forcibly made raw materials that meet refining standards. This set of operations is more sophisticated than mixing a cocktail.

The strategic oil reserve is a trick. The underground oil depot in Huangdao, Qingdao, looks like a seafood cold chain base, but in fact, the 30-meter-deep cave contains enough crude oil for the whole country to use for 15 days. Even more amazing is the LNG receiving station on an island in Zhejiang. The gas tanks are disguised as wind turbines, which cannot even be recognized by Google Maps. When the situation in the Taiwan Strait was tense last year, these “shadow energy bases” extended the life of power plants on the southeast coast within three days, and the fluctuation of electricity prices was suppressed to less than 2%.

The power attack and defense war is hidden in the UHV tower. The “technical supply cut” of the Qinghai-Henan 卤800 kV line last year was actually a remote control of the converter valve temperature sensor by hackers from a certain country. Our engineers directly switched to manual mode and relied on the old master to touch the vibration frequency of the transformer to determine the load status. This set of folk methods actually broke the opponent’s digital encirclement. Now all newly built wind farms are equipped with “electromagnetic fingerprint locks”, which automatically identify the grid feature code when connected to the grid, and foreign wind power equipment cannot be connected to the Chinese grid at all.

Rare earths are the real energy lever. On the production line of a mine in Ganzhou, workers use X-ray sorting machines to extract terbium from tailings with an accuracy of 99.99%. The engine of the US F-35 fighter lacks these “industrial vitamins” and even starts up. Even more ruthless is the magnetic material processing link – Japanese companies bought Chinese rare earth permanent magnets and wanted to dismantle and reverse engineer them, but found that the heat treatment curve used a chaotic algorithm and could not be copied at all.

# Network sovereignty

A data center in Hangzhou suddenly experienced a traffic tsunami in the early morning – an overseas IP launched a DDoS attack with 3 million requests per second. The defense system automatically turned on the “Tai Chi mode” and directed the attack traffic to the honeypot cluster of Yunshang Guizhou, and then located the attacker’s chicken network hidden in Kiev. This kind of scramble for every inch of cyberspace is more brain-burning than territorial defense. Last year, a social platform suddenly broke out the “emoji uprising”, and the panda head emoji was implanted with malicious code. The Cyberspace Administration of China directly launched a “digital disinfection cabin”, and the net net rate reached 98% within two hours.

The battle for data sovereignty has already begun on submarine optical cables. The Shanghai landing station of the direct submarine cable between China and the United States has now deployed quantum key distribution equipment, and the key generation speed is 17 times faster than traditional encryption. During an international conference last year, politically sensitive information that was disguised as video streaming data was intercepted. After decoding, it was found that it was ciphertext hidden in the spectrum of Douyin’s popular BGM. Now, multinational companies’ Chinese business data, even backup tapes, must go through the “data naked channel” through customs, and are physically isolated throughout the transportation.

Social media has become the opium war of the new era. After the upgrade of WeChat’s “fuse mechanism”, the risk level of group chats can be predicted by the density of chat keywords. The “fruit alias method” (replacing sensitive words with apples and bananas) taught in a color revolution manual last year was discovered by the algorithm after just three uses. What’s even more amazing is the “painting style filter” of short video platforms. Even if the current politics are alluded to in the form of animation, AI can identify sensitive scenes from the reflection of the characters’ pupils.

The 5G battlefield is a dimensionality reduction attack. Each of the smart street lamp poles in Xiongan New Area is an edge computing node. Last year, a foreign embassy wanted to install monitoring equipment under the guise of a municipal renovation project, but the chip was burned by the electromagnetic pulse of the street lamp. Huawei’s 5G base station is even more ruthless. The built-in network security protocol will “tame” overseas equipment. Three months after a Canadian telecom operator’s equipment was connected to the Chinese network, it was automatically upgraded to a version that meets Chinese standards.

Digital currency is a hidden front in the struggle for sovereignty. The smart contract function of the digital RMB piloted the “border trade funds sandbox” on the southwestern border last year, and cross-border payments directly bypassed the SWIFT system. An underground bank wanted to use virtual currency to launder money, but was targeted by the exchange’s AI. The system found that the account’s transaction pattern at 3 a.m. was highly consistent with the GPS trajectory of Xinjiang’s cotton harvesting vehicles, directly triggering the central bank’s anti-money laundering Skynet.

1iz5fpq,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_epicwizard07/comments/1iz5fpq/notes_on_gerd/,Notes on GERD,"# What is GERD?

GERD stands for gastroesophageal reflux disease. It is a condition where the lower esophageal sphincter becomes relaxed and open allowing for regurgitation of stomach content into the esophagus and back of the throat, or acid reflux. It has many symptoms, the most common being heartburn and an irritated esophagus. It can lead to complications, for example, an irritated esophagus, or esophagitis, which can turn into Barrett's esophagus, which can turn into esophageal cancer, or esophageal adenocarcinoma. When it comes to GERD, there are usually many different causes and conditions, primary and secondary which may cause it to be, especially to the long-term sufferers. Some of the biggest risk factors for GERD are obesity, smoking, and alcohol consumption.

**Symptoms:**

The most common is heartburn. Then, backwash of food or sour liquid in the throat, upper belly or chest pain, trouble swallowing which is called dysphagia, and a sensation of a lump in the throat. If you have nighttime acid reflux, you are more likely to experience an ongoing cough, inflammation of the vocal cords which is known as laryngitis, and new or worsening asthma. Some other symptoms are nausea, postnasal drip, and hiccups.

# What can be done about it?

Like any condition, you have to identify potential risk factors and correct them, strive towards permanent solutions to the problems you face, and make the conditions for well-being more favorable, or in this case, make the conditions for not having GERD more favorable. When it comes to drugs and pharmaceuticals for treating GERD, if permanent solutions work for you, which will be the case for most people, then stick with that. The more you study physiology, medicine, and pharmacology, the more you will be repulsed to take drugs even as a medicine. There's nothing in this world for free; you shouldn't stay on a drug for the rest of your life if it's an option. The longer you stay on a pharmaceutical or drug, the more likely the potential adverse effects from that drug will manifest itself, and some of the adverse effects of many pharmaceuticals are very risky. There are many potential risk factors for GERD. In this post, I will go through as much as I can, however, there are likely some that I haven't mentioned, as physiology is a very vast field.

**The Identifiable and Correctable Risk Factors Are:**

1. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection

This is, to most, the easiest identifiable and correctable risk factor for GERD. These bacteria may be present in the gut. To test for it, you have to talk to your doctor and give a stool sample. If you test positive, then the reason for your GERD, *generally speaking*, will most likely be from this bacterial infection. It's a bacterial infection, so being free from GERD is as simple as taking antibiotics, and possibly other pharmaceuticals for a very short period of time. If you test negative, then that is one risk factor to be crossed off the list.

2. Anatomical risk factors

The anatomical risk factors are: obesity, a bulging of the top of the stomach up above the diaphragm also known as a hiatal hernia, pregnancy, connective tissue disorders, such as scleroderma, and delayed stomach emptying. To identify the risk factors for many of these, such as a hiatal hernia, you would want to see a gastroenterologist for conducting tests.

3. Smoking, alcohol, coffee and caffeine consumption

Smoking can contribute to GERD by relaxing the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and reducing saliva production, and cause damage to the LES. Alcohol consumption can contribute by relaxing the LES and can increase acid production directly. Caffeine can relax the lower esophageal sphincter, contributing to acid reflux. Coffee especially contributes to GERD compared to other common caffeinated drinks, due to its high acidity content. If you smoke cannabis and need to use it medicinally, you should consider switching to edibles if they achieve the same medicinal effect. Taking medicinal cannabis in the form of edibles is much more medicinal than smoking it if it works for you.

4. Certain foods, such as chocolate or spicy foods, and fatty or fried foods

Chocolate has caffeine and theobromine in it, which can contribute to GERD. Spicy foods can increase stomach acid production, but can also irritate the lining in the esophagus, which makes it more sensitive to stomach acid. While irritation of the esophagus may not be a direct cause of GERD, the very things that cause GERD may be the same things that perpetuate it or keep it going. High fat foods can relax the LES and usually take longer to digest, which can promote acid reflux.

5. Lactose

If you are lactose intolerant, you may experience some symptoms when ingesting anything with lactose, such as gas or bloating, which can contribute to GERD. Every human being other than infants are lactose intolerant to some degree. Switching to lactose-free milk would be best and is fairly easy to do. When it comes to lactose-free milk, in my experience and in the experience of others, certain brands of lactose-free milk taste gross, such as Lactaid. Fairelife is my favorite.

6. Improper breathing

I used to breathe backwards. When I fixed it, I noticed an improvement in my acid reflux. Back when I would breathe incorrectly, when I inhaled, my chest and belly would deflate, and on exhales, my chest and belly would inflate. When you breathe in, your diaphragm contracts, making your lungs expand. On exhales, your diaphragm relaxes, which pushes the air out of your lungs. The diaphragm is known as the umbrella muscle, which is responsible for these contractions. When you breathe in, your lungs need room to expand. I had this whole thing backwards, and so, I had a lot of pressure on my internal organs, which includes the LES. To correct this, you have to change the way you breathe. The recommend way to breathe by doctors is to use a technique called diaphragmatic breathing, which is a breathing technique commonly used by meditators and yogis. This method is also conducive for being free from GERD. For diaphragmatic breathing, otherwise known as belly breathing, you have to, as you breathe in, have your belly rise as it fills with air, while your chest remains mostly still or slightly expands. As you breathe out, your belly should fall as the air is expelled, while your chest remains mostly still. On another note, it is extremely hard to breathe with your diaphragm throughout the day when you perform your activities when you're rushing all the time. Try to do most things *slowly* and *calmly.* To make belly breathing a habit, practice it each day and it will gradually become more automatic.

In the context of breathwork exercises, belly breathing looks like this:

The object is \[the breath and the abdomen\]. Put your hand on your abdomen. Become aware of the rising and falling of your belly. Just focus on your breath and your abdomen.

*Breathing in,*

*my abdomen is rising.*

*Breathing out,*

*my abdomen is falling.*

7. Poor posture

Poor posture can contribute to GERD directly and indirectly. It does so directly by making less room for your internal organs, which means more pressure on your LES. It can do so indirectly by making you unable to sit it a healthy, non-slouched position, as it is hard to maintain perfect posture if it causes you pain. Good posture also makes belly breathing more natural and easier.

8. Dehydration

Dehydration is another. Dehydration can reduce saliva production. Saliva plays a key role in keeping stomach acid clear from the esophagus and neutralizing the pH levels of it. Be sure to stay hydrated.

9. Certain supplements

Certain supplements can contribute to GERD. The list is very big, so be sure to look into whatever supplement you're taking. One example is creatine. Creatine can contribute to GERD if you take in incorrectly. It can cause certain adverse effects, such as stomach cramps, diarrhea, and dehydration. To avoid the digestive issues and to provide a buffer for your stomach, take it with food and water. Something small, such as a Nutter Butter 5-10 mins before you ingest the creatine and then chase it with a tall glass of water. You can also make it into a shake, but if you prefer eating the powder raw, take it with food and water at least. A good rule of thumb is if a supplement has the word ""acid"" in it, it's generally another risk factor, such as alpha lipoic acid (ALA). Be sure to look into it.

10. Certain pharmaceuticals and drugs

Drugs like aspirin, anything with ibuprofen in it, and blood pressure medications can contribute to GERD. For ibuprofen or aspirin, follow the same basic logic with the creatine. Take it with food 5-10 mins before to protect the lining in the stomach. When it comes to other drugs, the same general rule of thumb applies with supplements. Anything with the word ""acid"" in it, you may want to look into, such as valproic acid. Insomnia drugs, any drug that may be used to treat insomnia, or any drug that comes with the subject effect of ""muscle relaxation"" is another risk factor, as it may relax the muscles of the LES allowing for regurgitation of stomach content.

11. Sleeping positions

You spend, or should spend, 1/3 of your life asleep. Some sleeping positions are better than others. Sleeping on your side, *namely your left side*, is generally regarded as the best sleeping position in the medical field. Side sleeping is conducive for having good spine and neck health, reducing snoring, and it also helps prevent your airway from collapsing. It is the recommend sleeping position if you're pregnant, especially in the last trimester. Sleeping on the left side puts less pressure on internal organs and promotes healthy blood flow, which means less pressure on the LES. A small pillow between your knees or a body pillow will help if you have neck or back pain or just find side sleeping uncomfortable.

12. Lifestyle and the human problem of suffering

A lifestyle with no exercising or physical activity can slow down the digestive process. Sitting in slouched positions with poor posture or in long periods can put pressure on the abdomen, promoting acid reflux. When it comes to suffering, namely, stress, your muscles, such as the diaphragm, may become tense which may affect the LES. Stress may increase stomach acid production, possibly through hormonal responses, and can potentiate or contribute to GERD through other means.

13. Age and genetics

As you age, the changes in your body may contribute to GERD, such as changes in digestion, reduced saliva production, and a loss of strength in the LES. Genetics can also play a role, such as having a family history of GERD, certain anatomical predispositions that arise from genetics, and metabolic factors like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

14. Previous damage/trauma and pressure around the abdomen

Previous surgeries that involve the abdomen, injuries to the esophagus, and nerve damage that controls the esophagus all may play a role. Frequent intense pressure around the abdomen, such as wearing a belt too tightly can put pressure on the LES contributing to GERD.

**Helpful things:**

1. Furniture risers

Bed risers will help keep the stomach acid down when in bed. Since you spend 1/3 of your life asleep, it may be a good idea to do this, even if you don't have GERD to protect your health in the future. It's recommended to put the risers to tilt the bed and not just the mattress itself. You can also put just bricks under the legs at the bottom of the headboard. I just use furniture risers. You can find them online and tilt your bed 6-8 inches. To stop the bed from shaking or moving, you can place rubber grippers on the bottom of the front legs of the bed and of the furniture risers, and then heavy-duty Velcro squares on the furniture riser to the back legs, and wall anchors to push against the headboard. Be sure to put furniture risers less than the height of the ones on the back legs under the middle legs to keep the bed from breaking if it's made of wood and also so it doesn't sink when you lie down.

2. Foods that help

Eating healthy foods crowds out less healthy foods. Foods that help are foods high in fiber, non-citrus fruits or foods low in citrus, vegetables, such as dark green leafies, whole grains, ginger, low-fat lactose-free milk or dairy, and plant-based proteins, which are lower in fat. Ideally, you would want to cut back on fat, namely, saturated fats. If you exercise, you will still want 20-35% of *healthy fats* composing your daily calorie intake.

**Conclusion:**

To summarize, there are many risk factors that can contribute to GERD, too many to summarize in the conclusion. It'd be best to just correct one risk factor at a time and see what happens. It's a slow process, but it's good to get to a start somewhere. In my experience with having GERD, belly breathing was the most helpful, and I noticed a lot of improvement by just changing the way I breathe! It took time, and I still don't fully breathe with my diaphragm, but in situations where my GERD symptoms are really bad, focusing on belly breathing makes it go away more quickly and provides immediate relief.

I just turned 19 last year kaya bata pa. Hindi ko alam kung anong pwede kong gawin sa co-workers ko rito, kasi nung unang months ko sa company okay naman kami.  Pero kasi naiinis na rin ako sa mga ginagawa nila these past few days dahil nalaman nila na nagrrant ako sa new found friends kong kasing age ko about them. Nasa sales kami btw, and yung friends ko nalipat sa marketing kaya di ko sila kasama at all times. Ito yung mga reasons why di ko na pinansin yung coworkers ko rito dahil sa mga ugali nila:

• Nasa field kami nito kaya yung suot semi/formal dapat kasi haharap sa clients. Kaya naka heels din ako. Nag lunch kami somewhere, and yung sahig naka parang bricks siya na magkakahiwalay. Natapilok ako non tapos nakita nila ko, edi nagtawanan sila. Natawa rin ako siyempre pero as a typical Gen Z, nag bad finger ako sa kanila habang tawang-tawa. I admit na mali rin ginawa ko non, pero kasi nagulat ako tapos napahiya sa ibang tao kaya ako nag bad finger sa kanila kasi grabe tawa nila. Kinabukasan non pagkadating ko ng office pinag-uusapan na nila yung ginawa ko tapos sinabihan akong ""ikaw K lumalabas na totoo mong ugali ha"". Tinawanan ko na lang sila pero medyo na-off ako. Sila nga grabe kung mag murahan sa isa't isa, pero pag sinabayan sila ng mas bata sa kanila, pangit na agad ugali ko?

• Ito naman, nasa field kami ulit, nag-ayaan sila mag coffee yung nauuso ngayon na may b1t1. Ginamit namin number ko since di pa registered don sa app, tapos habang nagpipindot ako ron, nag-aantay mag proceed yung app, inagaw nung isang ka-work ko yung phone sabay sabing ""ako na nga"". Like, ginagamit ko pa teh, nag aupdate rin ako sa bf ko, bakit mo aagawin nang ganon na lang phone ko? Dibaaa. Napatingin na lang ako non sa langit talaga tapos ngumiti nang pilit hahaha. 

• Malapit na nito birthday ko. Nung nalaman nila yon dahil sa lecheng hr din kasi finaflash yung mga celebrants sa tv screen, di na nila ko tinantanan. Wala talaga akong balak magpakain nito kasi ipapang treat ko na lang sana fam ko, and ang dami rin kasing pakakainin, almost 30pax palalamunin ko non, e ang sahod ko lang minimum. Nasaktuhan din kasing may 13th month pay kaya siguro nag eexpect sila magpakain ako. Nung nagtatatlong isip ako magpakain, kinukulit nila ko ""bday na ni K sa ano. K, san tayo sa bday mo?"" desisyon sila masyado ahwhahahah nagssuggest pa sila kung saan oorder. Sinasabi ko na lang di ko alam, wala akong balak magpakain kasi ang dami rin nila. Sinasabihan ako nung isang kasama ko na mag leave na lang sa mismong bday ko hahaha kaso di ko rin sinunod kaya alam kong kasalanan ko rin. Nung dumating yung sahod nung araw ng bday ko, umorder na lang ako ng pancit tsaka pichi-pichi. Lagas 13th month ko non gawa na rin ng trineat ko fam ko sa restau, and nag gift ako sa self ko ng nail extensions haha. Umorder din ako non ng susuotin ko sa year end kasi suggest nang suggest si ate L na mag backless ako na dress kasi maganda raw ako bagay sakin (we found out kasi na may prize kapag napili ka sa best dressed kemerut na in the end, wala naman pala. sayang pinambili hahahaha). Kinabukasan, pagtapos ng bday ko, wala na ulit pansinan.

• Nito lang, nag enroll ako for second sem sa school. Maglleave sana ako nung araw na yon kasi akala ko aabutin na naman ako ng hapon sa enrollment. Nagdecide na lang ako na mag half day kasi wala rin naman akong pupuntahan kasi yung bf ko nasa work din (same company). Pumasok na lang ako ng hapon. 12 nito, break time. naglalakad ako paakyat, then napadaan ako sa smoking area. Nung una nakita ko na yung ibang friends nila na beks pero di ko na pinagtuunan nang pansin tas nagphone na lang habang naglalakad. Bale magkasalubong kami nito kasi palabas sila ng smoking area tapos ako madadaanan ko sila. Tinawag ata nila ako nung napadaan ako sa harap nila pero di ko napansin kasi (1) naka ear pods ako. (2) ayoko na rin sila pansinin magmula nung na-o-off na ko sa mga ginagawa nila. Pero nung nakalagpas naman ako hinawi ko yung buhok ko para makita sana nilang naka pods ako. Di ko clearly narinig yung sinabi nila pagkalagpas ko. Pero sure akong ""ang sungit"" or ""di namansin"" yung sinabi nila kasi may letter s akong narinig hahaha. Nakakunot lang naman onte yung noo ko kasi di ko makita binabasa ko sa phone habang nakayuko. Na-misinterpret ata nila yung pag ganon ko. Pagkabalik ata nila or kinabukasan, alam kong nagpaparinig sila na wag daw laging galit tsaka nakanguso or mahaba nguso, nag aasaran sila sa isa't isa nang ganon. 

• Lastly, dito ko na naka-close yung friends ko ngayon dahil na rin nagkakasama kami nung year end. Nag rant ako sa kanila tungkol don sa mga ginawa nung workmates ko. Sinasabi ko lang naman sa kanila kinakainisan ko kasi nakakainis naman talaga mga ginawa nila sakin (I know mababaw, pero kasi nakaka off talaga). At nalaman ng mga kasama ko yon kasi nagrrant din ako sa viber. Naging chismosa ba (pero di kasing lala nila). Nalaman ata nila yon nung naiwan ng isang friend ko yung laptop niya, kasi sabi niya pagbalik niya sa area naiba na raw ng pwesto yung viber niya sa laptop. E ako rin mostly nagrrant sa GCs namin kasi mas madaldal lang ako sa chat, hindi sa personal. Now, parinig sila nang parinig sakin na kesyo yung iba raw tahimik lang pero chismosa pala, na dapat daw iniistapler yung bibig lol, tapos itong kanina lang, sabi nung isa, buti pa raw yung mga kasama niya may benta, di raw tulad ng iba na wala pero puro chismis alam kong ako yon kasi ako lang naman wala pang benta pati yung friend kong isa pero goods naman kasi sila non. (may winowork out kaya akong project ngayon ulol). 

Di ko alam kung anong pwede kong gawin. Gusto ko sila ipa HR sa pangungupal nila. Not just me, pero may nauna pa sakin na pinaparinggan nila na ang pangit pangit daw, ganito, ganiyan. Bullying na ginagawa nila pero di nila dinadirect sa tao.

Alam ko rin naman may mali ako. Pero kasi, mabait ako sa mabait din sakin. Mabait pa rin ako kahit kinukupal na ko, pero kapag feel kong sumosobra na, hindi ko na pinapansin. Ganon lang naman ako sa ibang tao, kaya di ko alam kung bakit feel ko ako yung masama rito. 

Sila ang mas malalang chismosa. Imagine, nagpunta lang ako sa may bintana kasi ang hina ng signal, napatingin lang ako saglit, nagtanong na yung isa ng ""K anong ginagawa mo jan?"" yung pang chismosang tono. Di mo naman kailangan alamin lahat ng nasa tao teh, ewan ko ba kung sinong masama satin, ikaw ba o ako?

Also, baka mahirapan kayo i-identify which is which, yung madalas merong sinasabi is si ate J (ang dami niyang hanash sa ibang tao pero yung itsura niya katawang jabi tapos yung mukha niya parang si shrek. sarap niya laitin talaga) yung isa naman si ate L eto yung nagsabing istapler daw yung bibig kakachismis tsaka yung umagaw sa phone ko nang biglaan. Gandang ganda ako rito noon pero ngayon nabbwisit na ko sa kaniya. Gatong kasi. Silang dalawa yung pinakanakakabwisit talaga pag magkasama. Maingay lang naman si ate J kapag may kasama siya, pero pag siya lang mag isa tameme. 

Marami pang iba pero di ko na lalahatin. Alam ko rin naman na mababaw and magulo yung kwento ko, kaya sorry pero yaan niyo naaaa hahaha. Gusto ko lang ivent out yung nararamdaman ko tsaka humingi ng advice kung anong pwedeng gawin kasi baka mamaya sumabog ako rito tapos di ko alam gagawin ko, mapahiya pa ko. Utal-utal pa naman ako magsalita lalo na kapag malakas boses kaya sa ganto lang ako nakakapagrant nang tuloy-tuloy kahit magulo loool.

Thanks agad sa advice niyo. Idk if this is the right sub para mag share, pero sana matulungan niyo ko kung anong pwede kong gawin kasi gusto ko pa umabot ng november at kunin ang 13th month ko hahahahah. Update ko kayo kapag nagawa ko yung advices niyo. Thank you ulit!",1,1740623670.0,CasualPH,0,1.0,False
1iz5dzv,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1iz5dzv/explore_the_qja_em625_espresso_machine_review_is/,Explore the QJA EM625 espresso machine review: Is it worth the hype?,"Using the QJA EM625 espresso machine has been quite an adventure in my coffee-making journey. As someone who has tried various coffee makers in the past, I was curious to see how this compact, stainless steel machine with a 20-bar pressure system would perform. Here’s my breakdown of its performance and features based on daily use.

**Brewing Performance**

The brewing performance of this espresso machine is impressive for its size and price range. With its 20-bar pressure system, the device extracts rich and flavorful espresso shots consistently. I experimented with different coffee beans, and each cup had a smooth, robust taste that rivaled café-quality coffee. The brewing process is quick, and the machine heats up in no time, which is perfect for those rushed mornings. I’ve even timed it—less than a minute from start to finish. It’s incredibly efficient!

[Check QJA EM625 espresso machine price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0d9tr2bzy/)

**Design & Build Quality**

This espresso machine has a sleek and stylish stainless steel finish. It’s compact enough to fit on my kitchen counter without taking up too much space, which is a blessing for those of us with limited kitchen real estate. The LED touchscreen adds a modern touch and is easy to use, even for someone like me who isn’t particularly tech-savvy. However, I did notice the plastic tamper included felt a bit cheap compared to the rest of the machine’s build. While it doesn’t affect performance, it did make me question the overall durability of the smaller accessories.

**Coffee Quality**

I’ve been blown away by the quality of the espresso this machine produces. The flavor is smooth and well-balanced, with a rich crema on top that I didn’t expect from a machine at this price point. I’ve even had friends over who commented that the coffee tasted like it was from a high-end café. Whether I’m making a single shot for myself or a double shot for my partner, the results are consistently excellent.

**Milk Frothing & Steaming Capability**

The milk frother on this machine is a game-changer. It produces a creamy, rich foam that’s perfect for lattes and cappuccinos. I’ve been trying my hand at latte art, and while I’m no professional barista, the frother makes the process enjoyable and straightforward. The steam wand is powerful yet easy to control, which is great for beginners like me who are still learning the ropes of milk frothing.

**Features**

One of the standout features of the QJA EM625 is its automatic cleaning function. This saves a lot of time and effort, especially for someone like me who uses the machine multiple times a day. The removable drip tray and water tank are also convenient and make maintenance a breeze. Additionally, the LED touchscreen simplifies the brewing process. I appreciate being able to select my coffee options with just a few taps.

**Water Tank & Capacity**

The machine comes with a 57.5-ounce water tank, which is more than enough for daily use. I typically make two or three cups of coffee a day, and I only need to refill the tank every three days or so. It’s easy to remove and clean, which is another plus. However, if you’re hosting a gathering or making coffee for a large group, you might find yourself refilling it more frequently.

**Energy Efficiency & Noise Levels**

The QJA EM625 operates quietly, which is a relief. I’ve had espresso machines in the past that sounded like jet engines, but this one is surprisingly discreet. As for energy efficiency, it seems to use minimal power without compromising performance. The machine also has an auto-shutoff feature, which is great for peace of mind.

**Advantages**

* Produces café-quality espresso with rich crema.
* Compact and stylish design fits small spaces.
* User-friendly LED touchscreen simplifies the brewing process.
* Efficient milk frother creates creamy foam for lattes and cappuccinos.
* Automatic cleaning function saves time and effort.

**Minus Points**

* Plastic tamper feels less durable compared to the rest of the machine.
* Espresso temperature could be slightly hotter, especially for those who prefer extra-hot coffee.
* Instructions could be clearer; I had to rely on online videos to figure out some features.

**Direct Competitors**

Compared to other espresso machines in this range, the QJA EM625 holds its own quite well. Machines like the Breville Bambino Plus and De'Longhi Dedica also offer compact designs and quality espresso, but they often come at a higher price point. While the Breville has an edge in heating speed and build quality, the QJA EM625’s automatic cleaning feature and LED touchscreen make it a more convenient option for everyday users. On the other hand, the De'Longhi Dedica provides slightly hotter espresso, which might appeal to those who prioritize temperature.

**Cost-Effectiveness**

For its price, the QJA EM625 delivers excellent value. You’re getting a machine that can produce barista-quality espresso, froth milk like a pro, and simplify maintenance with its self-cleaning function. While there are minor drawbacks, they don’t outweigh the overall performance and convenience of this espresso maker. If you’re looking for an affordable yet high-performing machine, this one is worth considering.

1iz5dzr,https://www.reddit.com/r/wirelessearbudsreview/comments/1iz5dzr/explore_huawei_freeclip_wireless_earbuds_review/,Explore HUAWEI FreeClip Wireless Earbuds review: Are They Worth It?,"Testing the HUAWEI FreeClip Wireless Earbuds has been an interesting journey, blending sleek design, innovative features, and some areas that could use improvement. As someone who uses earbuds daily—whether for work calls, gym sessions, or simply tuning out the world—I was eager to see how these performed. With their unique open-ear design, they promised a lot, and I was curious to find out if they delivered.

[Check HUAWEI FreeClip Wireless Earbuds price on Amazon.](https://wirelessemporium.com/check/b0cwxl2ymc/)

**Fit & Comfort**

Comfort is paramount for me since I often wear earbuds for hours. The HUAWEI FreeClip earbuds are impressively lightweight at only 5.6 g each. These tiny spheres rest lightly on my ears without causing discomfort. The open-ear design was a pleasant surprise, allowing my ears to “breathe” during extended wear. Even after a long day of use, I didn’t feel any soreness or fatigue, which has been an issue with other earbuds I've tried. The snug fit, enhanced by the Ni-Ti shape-memory alloy C-bridge, ensures they stay in place, even during a sweaty gym session or a quick jog around the block.

That said, the fit might not suit everyone perfectly. My coworker, who has slightly smaller ears, found them a bit loose after prolonged use. These earbuds seem to cater best to medium to larger ear shapes, so keep that in mind if you’re on the smaller side.

**Battery Life & Charging**

Battery performance is often a dealbreaker for wireless earbuds, and these don’t disappoint in this department. With up to 10 hours of playtime on a single charge, these earbuds lasted through my longest workdays. The quick-charge feature is another standout—just 10 minutes of charging provided enough juice for a couple of hours, which saved me during a last-minute meeting. However, the charging case itself isn’t water-resistant, so I’ve been cautious when carrying it around in damp environments.

**Sound Quality & Performance**

The audio experience was, in a word, satisfying. The 10.8 mm dual-magnet high-sensitivity drivers deliver a rich sound that’s clear and consistent. Vocals come through beautifully, and the bass isn’t overwhelming, which makes these a great choice for podcasts, audiobooks, or mellow music. However, at higher volumes, the bass does begin to taper off slightly. I also noticed that while the earbuds are excellent for private listening, the sound leakage could be an issue in very quiet settings. My partner could faintly hear my playlist while sitting next to me on the couch.

**Noise Cancellation & Ambient Mode**

The adaptive noise cancellation is decent but not groundbreaking. It’s not going to completely drown out the hustle and bustle of a noisy coffee shop or a crowded gym. However, the ambient mode is a game-changer. It cleverly balances music playback with environmental sound, ensuring I stay aware of my surroundings. This feature was particularly useful during outdoor runs. Safety first!

**Design & Build Quality**

The minimalist spherical design is undoubtedly sleek. These earbuds are an accessory you’d be proud to show off, not just functional tech. The black finish looks premium, and the shiny coating adds a touch of elegance. However, I noticed they can get a little slippery when my hands are damp, which made handling them tricky at times. The IP54 rating ensures basic protection against dust and water, but I wouldn’t risk wearing them in heavy rain or during intense workouts where excessive sweat might be an issue.

**Durability & Water Resistance**

Speaking of durability, the HUAWEI FreeClip has held up well against everyday wear and tear. I’ve dropped them accidentally a few times, and they emerged unscathed. The IP54 resistance gives peace of mind for light splashes or dusty environments. That said, it’s crucial to note that the charging case isn’t waterproof, which feels like a missed opportunity for those who lead active lifestyles.

**Warranty**

HUAWEI offers a standard warranty, which is reassuring. I haven’t had to use it so far, but knowing it’s there adds a layer of confidence. It’s worth mentioning that the warranty doesn’t cover liquid damage, so avoid charging these in damp spaces.

**Advantages**

* Feather-light design ensures all-day comfort.
* Impressive sound quality with clear vocals and balanced bass.
* Quick-charge feature is highly convenient.
* Adaptive noise cancellation combined with a practical ambient mode.

**Negative Attributes**

* Some sound leakage at higher volumes.
* Fit may not cater to smaller ears perfectly.
* Charging case lacks water resistance, limiting usability in some conditions.

**Product Rivals**

Comparing these earbuds with others in the market revealed some nuances. The Bose Open Earbuds are a direct competitor, offering slightly better sound quality and customizable EQ settings. However, the Bose earbuds fall short in battery life and are significantly more expensive. Another contender, the Tozo Open EarRings, impressed with their budget-friendly pricing and custom EQ feature. That said, the HUAWEI FreeClip outperformed the Tozo in terms of build quality and pairing reliability. If you’re looking for a balance between premium features and price, the HUAWEI FreeClip is a solid middle ground.

**Value for Money**

Considering the features packed into these earbuds, I’d say they offer solid value for money. While not the cheapest option, they strike a good balance between affordability and functionality. The premium build, combined with practical features like quick charging and ambient mode, justifies the investment for anyone who prioritizes comfort and usability.

1iz5cnr,https://www.reddit.com/r/SPNAnalysis/comments/1iz5cnr/scarecrow_3_my_brother_could_give_you_this_puppy/,"Scarecrow (3) ""My brother could give you this puppy dog look, and you’d just buy right into it.”","“We’re famous for our apples,” says Scotty, plying a young couple with free pie as Dean enters the café.  
  
“Oh, hey, Scotty. Can I get a coffee, black?” Dean asks. “Oh, and some of that pie, too, while you’re at it.” He never gets the coffee, or the pie, and Scotty seems keen to discourage him from talking to the young couple.  
  
It becomes a running gag in *Supernatural* that Dean repeatedly asks for pie but, for various reasons, he never gets it. I believe it’s more than a simple gag though. Beginning with this episode where apples and apple pie are a clear symbol of the wholesome American lifestyle the town initially appears to represent, I believe the pie that Dean is continually denied symbolizes the “apple pie life” that he secretly craves but feels he can never have.  
  
As he attempts to engage the couple in conversation, we get another brilliantly filmed and edited scene. Manners is a master of using facial close ups to create atmosphere and tone, and here we get an increasing sense of unease as we focus on Dean.

https://preview.redd.it/39ptusjdclle1.jpg?width=602&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=73e81dc948eed39480027ebcaf9974c21ef692b3

As he tries to convey a warning about the impending threat, the closeups are *too* close. They reflect how he appears to the young couple and imply that, from their pov, he is forcing himself into their personal space. It’s clear that he seems creepy and makes them feel uncomfortable.

https://preview.redd.it/vrokjanjclle1.jpg?width=602&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c8f7eb2df7b9cc7d2f899f4a8a8a3f2a74f594a0

Eventually he receives a firm rebuff from the young man.

https://preview.redd.it/xnotxjkmclle1.jpg?width=602&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d1f3ecbcebb866ad795f662a0b7596d9afb567b7

Dean laments the absence of Sam’s people skills: “You know, my brother could give you this puppy dog look, and you’d just buy right into it.”  
  
Sam’s “puppy dog” eyes was one of those concepts that captured the fandom imagination. It may come as a surprise to some, considering its ubiquitousness in fanon, but this was the only time the phrase was used in Kripke’s canon . . . at least until his fandom spoof episode in his last season as show runner, when he had Dean say it as an in-joke for the fans:

[\(“The Real Ghosbusters” s5e9\)](https://preview.redd.it/prk29xv1dlle1.jpg?width=602&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=47e6b8c9419d65f7d6b1384c3d8d734d6f9d626f)

Meanwhile, Sam is sharing chips and beers with Meg at the bus station. A bus station is one of those liminal spaces we’ve talked about before that are suggestive of transition from one place or state to another. Typically, they represent the threshold of a change that can be an opportunity for a new beginning or, alternatively, the introduction of a threat. Sometimes the two are not mutually exclusive. Often there is a sense of defamiliarization or an atmosphere of unease accompanying these places. Sam and Dean, however, actually spend a good deal of time in transit, moving from one place to another. The *interstate* scenes in the car imply a similar state of transition, but there is always the familiar presence of the Impala indicating that the brothers are, to a degree, at home in a continual state of flux and, in the first season at least, there is a sense of movement, progress and purpose in their journey. Here, however, the opportunity for movement has been frustrated by the unavailability of the Sacramento bus so, for Sam, the bus stop becomes a place of waiting; he is forced into stasis by an external factor beyond his control: the vagaries of a bus timetable. This contrasts sharply with the comparative freedom afforded by a car, which typically gives you the power to choose your own time and direction, a contrast that was emphasized by his conversation with the ticketing clerk:

https://preview.redd.it/rzm2inkjdlle1.jpg?width=602&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c345eecd4d8eebe4b02b7d66f693b6385e825242

Another thing the car provides is *protection* from the external elements. As an extension of Dean, the Impala also represents the protection Sam receives from his brother. Without the protective barrier of the car, and his brother’s presence, Sam is exposed and vulnerable to attack from dark forces. It is significant that Sam’s conversation with Meg takes place while he is stuck in this limbo.

https://preview.redd.it/mo6v8pgtdlle1.jpg?width=602&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=81ebb5b6cb09f9233bd7e39cf0e1e347df7ddf52

Meg is looking very seductive in her little off the shoulder number, and that’s no accident. It’s another thing that marks her as the temptress figure from the hero myth, attempting to lure Sam from his true path. But her tactics are more psychological than sensual as she tempts him away from Dean by mirroring his feelings about his family:  
  
MEG: I love my parents. And they wanted what’s best for me. They just didn’t care if I wanted it. I was supposed to be smart. But not smart enough to scare away a husband. (SAM smiles.) It’s just…because my family said so, I was supposed to sit there and do what I was told. So, I just went on my own way instead.  
(SAM stares at her.)  
[http://www.supernaturalwiki.com/1.11\_Scarecrow\_(transcript)](http://www.supernaturalwiki.com/1.11_Scarecrow_(transcript))  
  
Here we have another example of the literary doubling device that we’ve seen in earlier episodes, but it isn’t a matching of physical appearance (as it was in “Skin”, for example). Meg is the physical antithesis of Sam, being petite and blonde rather than tall and brunette, but she does have a strong resemblance to Jessica in some respects, and that’s probably not an accident either.

https://preview.redd.it/n907xvh4elle1.jpg?width=292&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eab7ec2d3fc463ae11781106e44e71ef0c8513f6

https://preview.redd.it/f7tkkwh4elle1.jpg?width=256&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=70de9bfd353c480f5fda23a93f2765d194b02a5b

This time the mirroring of Sam is situational/psychological rather than physical (in keeping with him representing the mental/moral half of the brothers’ partnership). Nevertheless, it still marks Meg as a *shadow* figure, representing an unexpressed side of him, and this point is emphasized by the fact that she’s wearing black. Noticeably, her eyes are very dark too – almost demon dark – and I wonder if that was a deliberate casting choice.  
  
Interestingly, it indicates there’s been a shift in Sam’s attitude since the pilot when Dean was the original shadow figure who represented the part of Sam that he feared and rejected. Now it seems that role has been transferred to this woman who is tempting him away from Dean; perhaps she now seems to represent the dangerous option – striking out on his own to try to find his father – while remaining with his brother has become more familiar and safe by comparison.  
  
Perhaps Meg recognizes that she’s unsettled Sam because she apologizes:  
  
MEG: I’m sorry. The things you say to people you hardly know.  
SAM: No, no, it’s okay. I know how you feel. Remember that brother I mentioned before that I was road-tripping with? (MEG nods.) It’s, uh, it’s kind of the same deal. (Ibid)  
  
Nicki Aycox, by the way, is another master of micro-expressions; catch this momentary “gotcha!” look she gives Sam when he says, “I know how you feel”:

https://preview.redd.it/l3hyxssmelle1.jpg?width=602&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fb6b64ddd7f75a03e84b09481709901fde9a7a27

But is Meg’s glee perhaps a little premature?  
  
“And that’s why you’re not riding with him anymore?” she asks.

https://preview.redd.it/gtcm4isrelle1.jpg?width=602&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=468bc50307177d8f70b03befe9a8ac448e515643

Sam doesn’t really answer. Does he seem a little sad and wistful? Like he’s missing Dean? Is it possible the conversation is actually having the opposite effect to the one Meg intends, and now he’s not really sure he knows why he’s not riding with his brother anymore?  
  
Meg’s appearance as the seductress figure confirms that Sam’s true path is with Dean, since she’s encouraging him away from it, but is she truly the primary source of temptation in this story? After all, Sam had already parted from Dean before her intervention so she can really do no more than encourage him along a path he’s already taking. Since it was the phone call from his father that precipitated that act, it could be argued that it was actually John who was the principal agent of temptation. Just a thought.  
  
The scene closes on Meg proposing a toast:  
  
(SAM shakes his head. MEG raises her beer bottle.) Here’s to us. The food might be bad, and the beds might be hard. But at least we’re living our own lives. And nobody else’s. (SAM taps his bottle against hers and they both drink.)  
[http://www.supernaturalwiki.com/1.11\_Scarecrow\_(transcript)](http://www.supernaturalwiki.com/1.11_Scarecrow_(transcript))  
  
On reflection it’s a deeply ironic statement, since the option of leading his own life was erased for Sam with the death of Jessica. Regardless of whatever he decides to do now - return to Dean or continue to pursue his father – it’s simply a Hobson’s choice between two roads that have already been mapped out for him by events beyond his control. And by the end of the episode, we have reason to question Meg’s freedom of choice too.  
  
  
  
TBC.

Captain Vernon Demerest went to the kitchen, and the cupboard was full of bottles with the name,those were the bottles that the passengers didn't drink so she took them for her party, he kissed her for a few moments then she pushed him away. They said and poured him some tea, then Gwen said that she was pregnant, he couldn't believe it, Gwen was sure that Vernon was the father of the baby. There was silence in the room. He thought that the best way was to give the baby up for adoption or an abortion. at least the trip to Naples was still up to.

Those things happened a lot of time, there was a plan called the Three point plans given to the airlines to help pregnant hostess, the airline would paid them for a ‘holiday’ and after the birth the baby would be adopted soon, but she had to tell the airline the father's name and he would help pay the medical expenses. 

Gwen wondered how he knew the very detailed three points plan, Vernon had had a similar situation, the baby was adopted, it was a girl and he had never seen her. He wished he would divorced Sarah and married Gwen, but the baby thing would be a problem so he would talked later about the possibility of an abortion 



***CHAPTER 14***

Keith was in the restroom holding the key of room 224, he looked for it for several minutes, he had lost sense of time, lately his mind felt like a worn out motor not longing working. After thinking how he would die and swallowing a bunch of nembutal he went back to finish his shift, the key with the number reminded him of June 24th, a year and a half ago, the day that his pain began.

It was a summer’s day with a clear sky, keith back then worked in a different airport (Washington Air Traffic Control in Leesburg) it was one of the busiest air control at the time, Keith worked with Perry yount, Keith worked in the controlled traffic in the Pittsburgh-Baltimore area, also Keith was training another man called George Wallace. He was working with George and training him, Keith felt proud about it, Perry would stay to supervise how everything was going, Keith went to the washroom but when Keith had left the room Perry had an emergency and landed a plane with a person that had a heart attack. Keith stayed in the washroom thinking about his life and how work was so exhausting for him, he stayed for another minute while Perry was bringing the plane down safely. 

Irving  redfern was flying his small private Beech bonanza to Baltimore, he was with his wife and their two children, flying high above West virginia, and Wallace saw the plane as a green dot on the screen following a safe course, but something that they hadn't noticed it was that an Air national guard T-33 trainer was flying in the area and the pilot Lieutenant Neel hadn't realized that he had wandered a long way off course, and no one had not noticed until that moment. 

Keith after fifteen minutes he left the washroom, and the room looked busier than before. Wallace looked in panic, Keith pushed him on the other side to take control, he shouted to Irving to make a right turn, and the lieutenant's plane was rushing towards The beach bonanza. They watched in silence hoping that they didn't crash, but then on the other side of the radio was suddenly silent, and the two dots green met crashing into each other. 

The plane crashed and burned with the Redferns inside and the Lieutenant landed safely with a parachute. Perry was blamed and fired, and Wallace couldn't work as a controller anymore.

Keith had not held responsibility, but since that day he blamed himself for staying longer in the war room, he had nightmares about that day, he wouldn't look at his children's faces either. Natalie had begged him to change his job, that was the first time he thought about killing himself.



***CHAPTER 15***

An hour later tanya left mel she was in the room with the stowaway. It was an old lady named Ada Quonset. She looked calm and untroubled. She was wearing a black dress. Ada would reach Newy york but he had told her plan to a passenger who told her secret to a hostess. Ada was a widow with a daughter, and her daughter lived in New york, sometimes she would visit her without a ticket. She had been a stowaway in different airports, but Trans america was the best. Ada visited her daughter for a week or two, so she would go to the airlines office and tell them that she arrived as a stowaway, the airport would get angry and send her back.

Ada tried to avoid the topic, so she asked if she was married and her age. Tanya had recently been having a conflict about her aging, Ada wouldn't have any trouble because the airport's never do anything. The lady knew a lot of tricks to pass through without a ticket, then the Transport Manager phoned to see if Tanya got any useful information. Tanya sent the report and needed tickets to send her back to Los angeles. 

Ada said to Taynaya that she would like to take an indirect flight, and she would pretend to be asleep in the airports. Ada would go back to Los Angeles but she wouldn't be alone, a young agent called Peter Coakley would stay alongside Ada. After Ada had left Tanya wondered if she would come round again, but that wouldn't matter because Mel had come into her mind, asking herself If *he* would come around.



***CHAPTER 16***

The runway three zero was still blocked… there were many delays… The air force K-135 landed safely… Planes were taking off over Meadowood and the airport was receiving calls from the town… And Mel knew his wife would be at the party angry because he was still in his office. I am called Cindy.

She knew he was still at work and had finished, her voice was calm. Mel would be out at midnight and so Cindy would go to the airport to talk to Mel, she put the phone down.  He phoned home to Mrs Sebastiani, the babysitter, Roberta was asleep but Libby was still awake, he talked to her.

After the call he walked out of his office and looked down over the crowded hall, everyone was at the front of a notice of Flight two to Rome, Tanya was there talking to a group of passengers. She was busy trying to make it possible for the flight to take off on time. They talked about Captain Demester and their fight; Vernon thought that they shouldn't sell insurance at airports, Mel thought that they should still do it. 

It happened at a meeting of the Airport commissioners. Vernon talked about the insurance thing at the airport and how it was ridiculous and that invited madmen and criminals to murder for a few dollars. Mel said to the meetings that many people were afraid of flying , and liked to have insurance, also the airport needed the money they gained by selling insurance, and after that they had bad blood.

Back with Tanya they talked about their dinner later that night, and she would wait for him.



***CHAPTER 17***

 forty five minutes before the golden argosy took off was being prepared, those types of flights took weeks  or months. The last flight one of the engines had become too hot and worked perfectly with three engines. When they arrived at the airport a team of machines were waiting. It took them a long time. After the repairs were finished they loaded the planes with food, drinks and newspapers. The passengers' luggage were taken abroad. An extra fuel was loaded by request of Captain harris, he had not feel comfortable after vernon to put an airline’s shirt, harris asked for a friend of his but it was too small, he had any intention of argue with Vernon, another man would be flying with Harris and Vernon, the flight engineer called Cy jordan. A bus took the crew to the plane, there were five air hostesses,  one of them was Gwen.

Semester greeted the crew formally, then the bus started to drive, they had the last preparation to do when they arrived… Harris asked for extra fuel and Demester checked the weather report. The three men were ready to take off when Gwen arrived saying that the flight had been delayed an hour because of passengers that hadn't arrived yet and the bad weather. They decided to go to the coffee shop, and Vernon would think about talking to Gwen about the abortion thing.



***CHAPTER 18***

D.O Guerrero was shaking with fear for being late to the flight. He was on his way to the airport, and he lit his last cigarette. Even though the flight had been delayed an hour, the thick snow would make the bus slow for more than an hour. The bus were people that also would lose their flight if it didn't get faster, a few had gone by car to get there quickly. 

Guerrero’s tongue had gone dry, he needed to get there fast and needed fifteen minutes to spare so he could buy his insurance, his plan would fail. He had a small case with the bomb in it, and the ticket agent questioned why someone would bring only a case for a trip to Rome. He knew that he should have brought extra luggage but if  the plane was exploited there wouldn't be any proof. A child that was running in the bus fell into the seat next to Guerrero, knocking the case onto the floor. He wanted to hit the kid but he managed himself because soon enough they all would be dead.

The bus started to drive faster, he got more worried about his luggage and that the ticket agent  would have called the airport and he would have gotten in, but he’d just pull the sting and he would not go to prison.

Inez Guerrero came to her apartment from her work tired and probably got a cold. Two years before she had looked younger and happy but at that moment she seemed much older. She found a note in the living room from her husband saying that he would not be home for a few days, he was going away. That did not surprise her at all.

But in the more it didn't say where he was going, and with whom money because they only had a few dollars, she went to bed and opened a drawer where laid a yellow ticket, showing Guerrero had bought airline ticket to rome for forty seven dollars and promised that he would pay the rest over two years. 

She got curious why her husband would go to Rome, she knew he was in trouble somehow, she went to the phone and called Transamerica, discovered that the flight had been delayed an hour, she tried to find if his husband was in the flight but the airline wouldn't say private information. She spent her last dollars on a taki to the airport, but when she was on his way to the airport, Guerrero had reached the terminal. 



***CHAPTER 19***

The Meadowood meeting was ending, they just needed to talk about what they would do next. Elliot's going to the airport. He wanted all of them to go with him. Everyone didn't think twice that they would join Elliot. But before they could keep going with the plan they needed to get the attention and sympathy of the public, so they would go to the radio and television to have a good story. He knew that there would be problems at the airport when they arrived but he had to make sure to not break the law. Elliot calculated the amount of money he would get and it was worthy, he needed to satisfy his audience, he saw the reports on the phone to his notice and he knew their plan was ready.



***CHAPTER 20***

Joe patrine arrived at the airport after three hours, he jumped out of his car, lit a cigar and got into the truck that would take him. Mel left Joe a message saying that he would give him a box of cigarettes if he took the plane off the runway, Joe laughed.

Joe got updated on what had been happening, that they had taken the passengers with the luggage to try to use the power to move the plane… that failed. Patroni realized that the snow stuck the plane onto the ground. He arrived to work with the maintenance men and worked with them, to get the plane off the runway would take at least an hour.



***CHAPTER 21***

Vernon and Gwen sat to drink coffee, Gwen knew that Vernon was lost in his mind about her being pregated. Vernon started to talk about the option of an abortion, Gwen didn't know what she would do yet but she seemed that she didn't want to abort it. She thought he wouldn't leave her, but he would when the trip to Naples ended because he knew how to end affairs. 

Vernon saw Mel talking to Ned Ordway, chief of police that worked at the airport. saying that the people of Meadowood were coming to the airport. Vernon walked towards Mel and talked with him bitterly and egocentric. He saw a man nervously join the line of people waiting at the desk of insurance  and then he heard the announcement of the departure of flight two, the golden argosy for Rome.

  
  
  
  


***CHAPTER 22***

The departure of the Golden argosy was announced, and Gwen Heighen welcomed the people on board the plane and Mel when he heard the announcement he couldn't help but thinking that him and vernon would find another way to be more polite with eachothers, and while people were arriving at the plane Ned Ordawy received a message, that people from Meadowood arrived at the airport.

When the announcement had been heard, Ada Quonsett was talking with Peter Coakley about her late husband. He was so tired of being in his uniform looking after an old lady because her flight to Los Angeles was delayed by the storm. While she talked she was thinking of a way to get away from him, so she acted like she was sick and went to the bathroom. 

in the ladies room, she talked with a woman and asked her if he could send a message to Peter that she needed a doctor. As Ada told her she did so and Peter went to fetch a doctor. When the woman had gone, Ada walked quickly towards gate 47. Tanka at that moment was dealing with a man that claimed that his luggage had been damaged. 

When the flight departure was announced D. O Guerrero was still in line for insurance, he was shaking with nerves, he looked at the clock and he had many people before him. In despair he pushed himself to the front of the line shouting that his flight was departing. and the woman at the desk saw his face of ‘hurry’ that let him skip the line.

Bunnie Vorobioff let D.O guerrero skip the line, she sold insurance in the airport, she had a big smile and wonderful figure, she needed to look beautiful that day because the insurance company was holding a competition for the person who would sell the largest amount of insurances. Guerrero asked for a small policy but Bunnie offered him a big one of three hundred thousand dollars, eagerly he accepted. but he couldn't find the exact money until he found five dollars. Bunnie had seen Guerrero's worried and shaky face, she questioned herself about selling him a policy, but she wanted the prize. He insured Guerrero and posted the policy to Inez and rushed towards gate 47.



***CHAPTER 23***

Harry Standish said goodbye to his favorite niece Judy, who was traveling at the Golden argosy. Harry worked at custom inspector, he stood near gate 47 watching the last passengers, Tanya had left and then a old lady claiming that his son had forgotten his money, so Harry let the old woman in and behind the old lady a man with a suitcase arrived at the plane, but Harry felt that man had something weird going on.

D.O Guerrero could insurance himself and get on the plane. his seat was by the window, in the center was empty and the next seat was another man. Ada was hiding in the bathroom when the air hostesses were counting the people on the plane. She opened the door and saw an empty seat between two men. She got curious about the man next to the window that was holding a suitcase firmly, he looked worried and yellow-faced. 

Standish talked with tanya about the last man that had arrived at the plane how he looked weird, when she walked back to her office thinking about what inspector Standish told her when she came across Peter coakley telling her that Ada had disappear, she went angry because the old woman was more clever than her.

Vernon demester was losing his temper because they hadn't taken off yet, it seemed that the passengers counting, Vernon claimed that they were wasting fuel and they needed to take off immediately, and so they did… and at that moment Inez Guerrero had arrived late at the airport.



***CHAPTER 24***

Gwen Meighen had to receive a warm welcome from all the passengers and showed the passengers what to do in case of an emergency, and the last announcement was that they would reduce the power of the engines to lessen the noise. She sat looking out the window at the lights of the airplanes that were going to take off, then she thought about Vernon's child and her own and what could she do. The plane was prepared in the runway two five that was cut by another runway one seven. Captain Harris made the announcement and as fast as possible they were taking off.

Keith bakersfield was not controlling the take off of flight two, he was doing her last job as air traffic control before killing himself, while he was thinking mel had stopped to talk to his brother, mel handled him a cup of coffee and keith was shaking, they went outside the room to talk and mel asked him if he felt good because he noticed he didn't look good at all. mel and keith’s wife talked about keith’s mental illness that maybe had to do with lessburg’s incident, he couldn't tell him about his suicide attempt but keith told mel how was his own fault about the accident. After talking to someone who was looking for Mel, Mel's eyes were watery and Keith felt relieved to share his deepest secret. Keith went back to the radar room and Mel had to talk to Danny Farrow and Ned Ordway, Mel had been informed that the people of Meadowood were arriving at the airport, and a police officer had found a woman crying and left her at Mel’s office… Mel would go to his office to talk with the crying woman called Inez guerrero.

Tanya couldn't believe how Ada could have tricked her like that, she blamed herself for it, Tanka would tell Captain Semester about her mistake with Ada, but her mind also couldn't focus because of the thin man on board flight two. 



***CHAPTER 25***

Cindy was taking a taxi to the airport, she was thinking about how she and Mel had grown apart over the last years, she speculated that happened after Kennedy’s death and how Mel had focused only on his work, and left Cindy by herself in their relationship and their childrens. But when Mail was focused on his work Cindy found a lover Lionel, he came from an old, respected and wealthy family, Lionel was willing to marry Cindy after he left his wife and was willing to take care of her daughters. So, she was going at the airport to talk to Mel to see what they should do with their relationship.

Cindy arrived at Mel’s office, she saw a woman outside the office, her clothes were wet and she looked like she was crying, Cindy didn't get any notice and entered his office waiting for Mel. Minutes later Mel came into the office, they didn't want to fight but Cindy had a lot to say explaining the nights he didn't have to work late, because he didn't want to come home. Mel spilled how he felt about going home, how his work kept him busy and the parties Cindy wanted to go to. They had to end the fight, and also they ended their marriage. Ordway entered the office informing the people of Meadowood brought six representatives, they got into Mel’s office, One was Elliot Freemantel followed by three reporters. Cindy stayed in the office and the woman outside Mel’s office had gone.

  
  
  
  


***CHAPTER 26***

Flight two was twenty minutes away from Lincoln International, the plane received the information about Ada, Demester sent Gwen to check if the woman was in fact at the plane as a stowaway, she came back laughing. Demester decided not to do anything and waited till they arrived in Rome. 

Vernon talked with Harris about their repetitive couples and babies, and debated the abortion thing and how Harris viewed it. Harris had a strong view about it but Vernon didn't agree with what Harris said, Vernon dismissed the conversation.

Ada was enjoying herself and talking with a musician that sat next to her, she was talking about her husband and drinking, unless the man to her left side that tried to talk to him but he seemed invested in his suitcase. Guerrero calculated that maybe in two hours he would pull the string and blow up the airplane, he didn't want to talk to anyone, even the old woman beside him, he only dreamed all the money Inez would get. Then he fell asleep with a hostess reminding him that dinner was ready.



***CHAPTER 27***

Mel had met Elliot Fremantle and he’d already disliked him, Elliot tried to seem like Mel didnt care at all about people’s life at Meadowood, he just was trying to lose Mel’s temper. The airport cared about people’s life, the airport had been meeting with the town, but Elliot questioned what Mel said. Also, Elliot asked why they were using the runway nearest the town if they didn't use that, Mel explained they had to because of the evidenced storm happening but that didn't make it any different. 

Elliot even though he knew it wouldn't happen, he said that the town would take the airport to court and closed it down. Mel knew that there were cases but at the end of the day the airport won. Mel decided to speak up and told them that they can reduce the noise of the planes when it takes off and lands, the only solution for the Meadowood people should be to move out. Mel’s office was a chaos with Freemantel; the reporters and Cindy there. a reporter gave Mel a paper that people of the town had signed, the reporters would probably write that in his report and Mel understood what Elliot was trying to do.



***CHAPTER 28***

Cindy stood up, reclaiming to him how his work was more important than her and his daughters. There was a knock at the door, it was Tanya, Tanya looked surprised by the visit of Cindy. 

Cindy smelled something weird between Mel and Tanya, Cindy got jealous and almost crossed the line with her questions to Tanya, Mel stopped her. 

Tanya told Mel about the thin man carrying only his suitcase in flight two, Tanya told him that she believed that the weird man carried a bomb in his suitcase. Mel got confused as to why someone would bring a bomb, that sounded insane. He phoned the insurance desk asking the woman all the passengers that brought insurance policies, he got the name of the man, it was called D.O Guerrero, like the name of the woman that was outside his office. Tanya made the announcement all over the terminal that Inez would be found. There was a lot going on in Mel's head, Cindy had already left without notice, his worries about Keith and at that moment the man that insured his life for three hundred thousand dollars that bought with his last coins.

  
  


***CHAPTER 29***

Patroni was working with the Aereo mexican plane with a small group of aereo mexican and TWA, also crew from Braniff and Pan Am had come to help without being asked. The work was longer than he’d expected, the crew had to stop digging because his hands got frozen. The captain of the plane was in the plane listening to music and not helping very much. Patronie offered to drive the plane, but the captain refused. When the digging stopped, that was the sign to turn on the plane, the captain tried to turn on all the power of the plane, but it wouldn't work out. so, Patroni offered to drive the plane again, the captain gave Patroni his place but the problem got extended because the aircraft was deeper in the mud so they’d have to do all the operation again.



***CHAPTER 30***

Inez was confused about what she was doing at the airport, she was lost in her mind. She had given her last ten dollars to the taxi driver so at that moment she had nothing, also flight two had gone she had been late and Guerrero had left. 

She started to cry, because all the effort she had given, her children and Guerrero, she was hopeless. People passed by her and gave her strange looks, then a policeman found her and took her to Mel’s office. She thought that someone had announced her name but she couldn't believe it because no one knew her name.



 ***CHAPTER 31***

The office of mel’s was full of people that worked at the airport, tanya’s chief Bert Weatherby arrived first followed by Ned Ordway. Tanya and Mel tried to explain that they believed there was a bomb in Flight two. A custom inspector Harry Standish arrived with the girl that sold insurance Bunnie Vorobioff, she looked pale and frightened. They had to decide if tell Captain Demerest about the bomb on the plane, the phone had rung with the information of the plane’s position; height; speed and course, and that the runway three zero would be able to be use in one more hour, Inez guerrero had not been found yet, they still trying to figure things out.

They tried to talk to Bonnie if she remembered the man D.O Guerrero but she couldn't remember, they put pressure on her then she decided to talk and describe how D.O Guerrero looked, Weatherby was mad at the insurance woman and in general with insurance. They prepared to send the message when Ordway arrived with news that they found Inez guerrero. 

she was sitting in Mel’s office, she didn't know why her husband was flying to Rome, they didn't know anyone from Rome, he had sold Izen’s mother ring to pay the ticket, Guerrero had lost his job and they were in debt, he was stranger doing things behind her back and also being violent sometimes, he like to use explosives, he kept them in a drawer but that night when she was bad they weren't there. 

She didn't know he had insured his life to her name, when she heard that he might have brought a bomb to the plane to give her the insurance life she knew that D.O Guerrero would do something like that. 

 

  
  


***CHAPTER 32***

On Flight two the captains were enjoying their meal when they received a radio message, they faces changed suddenly and immediately tried to get a change plane action to turn in a wide circle that the passengers wouldn't notice, Harris did that meanwhile Vernon sent Gwen to look round and see if in fact D.O Guerrero was there and how would they get his suitcase away from him easily. But she remembered that man’s face, when she offered to take his suitcase to give him dinner he refused, and he was sitting next to the stowaway and that would make it more difficult. Vernon sensed real danger, but he had an idea.

Ada finished her dinner when two hostesses arrived at her seat suspiciously asking to give her her ticket. Gwen was being rude and unpleasant as Vernon told her to do. When Ada didit find her ticket Gwen said that they knew who she was, the musician tried to help and Gwen was making sure that Guerrero heard, so she took Ada with the captain.

When Ada met Vernon he told her that everything that happened was a lie, Ada was quite excited for what would happen, Vernon told Ada that the man next to her had a bomb in his suitcase, she suspected that they wanted her to retreat the suitcase from him and help them. Vernon told her the plan, and then asked her why was she flying as a stowaway and Ada told him all the story of her daughter and hoe lonely she felt, so Vernon promised if she help them they would gave her free tickets to New york and back first class, her eyes filled with tears.

Ada came back fake crying, passengers gave Gwen a bad look at how she ‘treated’ Ada. Ada begged Gwen not to send her to prison and Ada cry more and more, Gwen pushed harder to Ada that she screamed how she was treating her, turn to Gurerreo asking for help but he didn't care, so Ada screamed and cried uncontrollably and threw her arms around Guerrero neck, he tried to free from her. Vernon behind a curtain saw what was happening waiting for Gwen to take the suitcase, she did but not soon enough a man called Marcus Rathbone had to ruin the plane.

Marcus was a stubborn that liked to criticize people’s ideas and also her was a machist that didn't like to see women mothering, when he saw Gwen taking the suitcase he thought he needed to do something, so he took the suitcase from Gwen’s hand and gave it back to Guerrero. He held the suitcase tightly, Vernon arrived late that Guerrero had pushed past them and ran to the back of the plane. Vernon screamed bomb that it wasn't a surprise that everyone on the plane would scream and get scared. 

Close to the toilets there was no escape, Vernon told him that they knew who he was and his plan with the bomb and the insurance, and that that wouldn't work out and the insurance wouldn't be paid. Vernon would keep talking to him when the toilet was unoccupied Guerror locked himself in. but Gwen had stuck his foot between the door before it was fully-closed.  

Guerrero was confused with the last few minutes but he at least understood that his plan had failed, so the last thing that had to be done was to pull the sting and so he did.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  


***CHAPTER 33***

The explosion was immediately huge and destructive, inside stuck with a deafening roar, D.O Guerrero died instantly and his body was completely destroyed, a large hole appeared in the side of the plane. Gwen received the impact of the explosion in her face and chest. 

The hole caused decompression, a dark cloud rolled through the aircraft carrying trays, bottles and bags thrown off the plane, people were confused and the oxygen masks fell down. The plane got filled with mist and frizzy cold, and the noise from the engines and the wind made it unbearable. Vernon tried to help people to put their oxygen mask on when he saw Standish's niece helping a woman to put on their mask. He had to reach the Captain cabin and to tell Harris and Jordan what had happened.

Harris and Jordan felt the explosion, they hadn't had enough time to think, they needed to act fast, they put oxygen masks on and pushed the bottom and gave oxygen masks to the passengers. Harris reduced the speed, so the passengers could breath he needed to bring the plane down, he asked himself if it should be a slow dive or a fast one. There were things that could go wrong but he couldn't stay thinking, Harris told Jordan to send a message to Warn Air Traffic Controls that they’d do a fast dive. They dive faster and faster, at fourteen thousand feet he would level at ten, the control seemed to be working well, when they were at ten he leveled it.

Vernon came into the cabin, explaining that a bomb made a hole in the plane, Vernon sent Jordan to count and see how bad was the damage, and if Gwen was alive. The plane must lande on the longest runway, that was in Lincoln, it was an hour away Vernon hoped that the plane was able to stay still for an hour. There were several Doctors on the plane and he didn't know anything about Gwen. They’d landed off the runway three zero but it was blocked so at the airport Patroni had fifteen minutes to clear it.



***CHAPTER 34***

All the people of Meadowood and the cameraman followed Elliot Freemantel and were making noise in the terminal hall of the airport but not the police. Elliot talked with a reporter talking down at the airport that they were cheaters and liars. More people arrived and got nosier, Elliot only needed the police to arrive so the reporters could write it down but the police were busy looking for Inez Guerrero. After the police chief, Ordway, and Mel finished talking with Inez they saw all the crew of people gathering around Elliot, Mel had enough of Elliot and his lies so he confronted him, when everyone went silence Mel started talking again that they tried to reduce the noise but the storm made it impossible, moreover the planes get bigger and bigger as well as nosier and nosier. 

Mel had to tell them the truth about how twelve years ago the companies that built the houses in Meadowood were aware of the airport being close to the town but they were too greedy and didn't care and built houses anyway. After speaking Mel felt pity for the people’s town because it wasn't their fault but he couldn't help them either. To conclude, Mel told the people that lawyers often tried to take advantage of those problems and lied to people because in the majority of those types of cases the people didn't win at all. 

The people turned to Elliot, they wanted their money back. Mel told them how they could get their money back and never heard from Elliot Fremantle again, also that made Mel sad because there was nothing he could do to help those people and the noise. Then, Tanya handed him a piece of paper, that was how he found out that Guerrero had pulled the string, and the plane would land on runway three zero… the runway that was still blocked. 



***CHAPTER 35*** 

Doctor Milton Compango was near the explosion, he was helping Gwen Meigher she was unconscious and bleeding, around him many passengers were bleeding from cuts.

Gwen would have been sucked out of the plane if her arm hadn't grabbed from a seat, also if it wasn't for the dive Gwen would have lost oxygen. 

Miltor was the only doctor on the plane with a medical bag, so he directed the other doctors. He asked an air hostess to help him with Gwen and gave her oxygen. Milton controlled the bleeding, then Cy jordan checked how Gwen was, she was stable. Vernon made an announcement that they would make a safe landing at Lincoln in forty five minutes.

Vernon thought how Mel would feel after that situation, then he received a radio message that the runway three zero was still out of use, but trying to clear it on time. He sent Jordan to tell the passenger what they had to do before landing, and Doctor Compagno entered the cabin, Milton explained how was Gwen and the injuries, Vernon felt sick. He told Miton that she was pregnant but that didn't change how she was. 

At that moment he realized he loved Gwen and he would have the baby because he didn't want to make the same mistake as his other daughter who did not know where she was. Also, he would tell Sarah the truth even though he knew there would be shouting at him but she wouldn't leave him, he loved the thought of being a father.

Harris took over the plane while Vernon sent a radio message to the airport that they needed the runway, and he insulted Mel saying that it was his fault after all.



***CHAPTER 36***

Emergency vehicles were called out into the airfield for the people in the plane injured. Mel noticed that Patroni hoped to move the plane in twenty minutes. Tanya and the reporter Tomilson was in the car with Mel, Tomilson asked what thing could he put in his story. After hearing the rough message from Vernon, Mel called Danny farrow to send snowplow and heavy vehicles to help Patroni, that would break the plane in million piece and lost a lot of money, but Mel just wanted to get that plane out of the way. 

They arrived at the runway and Mel told his plan to Patroni, Patroni thought he was mad, Patroni needed more time. 

They got back in the car. The reporter asked if Mel had changed his mind about the insurance policy. He might have changed but was still confused about what to think about it. Minute passed and the engineers started but it didn't move and there were six minutes left. He used all the engineers, but he couldn't move, Mel was ready to give the order, they would push the plane.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  


***CHAPTER 37***

Air traffic control wasn't quiet after midnight with the storm and the flight, Wayne and Keith were still on duty. Keith tried to focus on his work, his mind worked in two levels; the first one with all that he knew; the second were his personal problems. He felt he was already dead on earth. 

Wayne told Keith all that happened on flight two, the runway was trying to get clean, so the plane would land safely, and radio communication had been set up between the control power and Joe Patroni on board the Aereo Mexican plane, Wayne would have Keith closed just in case.

Keith heard the message of Vernon saying that he needed the runway to get clear of a plane full of dead passengers, flight two was close to land and Keith felt frightened, he couldn't bear another accident, Mel was ready to break the plane. Keith saw the plane in the radar room, tried to call Wayne but no words came out from his mouth. Wayne was there, then Keith felt anger for his father that put him into that job. Then words came out and apologized for making them wait, he would bring flight two safely. Mel's given the order to move the plane.



***CHAPTER 38***

Joe Patroni was running out of time, the crew needed at least another fifteen minutes to free the plane off the snow but there wasn't time. Patroni asked for a thin person on the flight deck, Mel had called snowploughts and heavy vehicles, but Patroni didn't like that idea because he loved planes and broke a fine machinery would be madness. A young mechanic called Rolling got up. Patroni started all the engines, the voice grew louder and louder and the plane didn't move, Rolling said that they couldn't do it, a radio messenger came through saying that there wasn't any more time. 

Rolling tried to tell Patroni that they couldn't do it but Patroni didn't hear he just pushed the control to its limit. Suddenly the aircraft moved forward slowly, then gained speed and cleared the way of runway three zero.



***CHAPTER 39***

Flight two was ten miles from the airport, everyone was ready to land; Gwen was stable; Ada held tightly hand with her neighbor thinking how that night was a chaos but at least she was alive to get her free ticket to New york; Standish niece, Judy was still helping the woman with the baby. The plane would probably lose speed after touching the runway. Keith Bakersfield announced that the runway three zero had been cleared.

Vernon tried to find the lights of the runway in between dark clouds, he landing would be hard because the tail might break off. Vernon saw the lights of the runway, they were above the runway moving fast, they got down to the runway, heavily. The end of the runway was covered in snow and darkness, but flight two had stopped three feet from the end of the runway.

  
  
  
  
  


***CHAPTER 40***

In the radar room, Keith was on duty for another hour but he stood up and said goodbye to Wayne. He walked out for the last time, he landed safety flight two and he felt light headed. 

Went into the restroom where he kept his things, took the photo of Natalie and he wanted to cry, and put it back in his pocket, that would be the last time he’d be in that room.

But he stopped himself, because he had another plan in mind, he wouldn't go to the hotel, instead he’d go home to Natalie.  He knew that he couldn't do anything for the Redferns, he had to live with those memories and try to handle it, and for a start he would never work again in aviation. Keith walked to his car and threw the nembutal into the snow.



***CHAPTER 41***

 Mel, Tanya and Tomlinson watched how Patroni moved the Aeroe Mexican and the successful landing of flight two, Tanya would be needed at the terminal, so she and Mel would meet in the terminal later. 

Tomilson walked to Patroni to speak with him, Tomilson would write a great story, even though Mel wasn't one of the heroes. The aereo mexican was moved away to be checked and washed for the next flight, Mel stayed there watching. 

He knew something would happen and still was going to happen if the airport didn't change, the airport was out of date, it needed to be fixed. Mel would call a meeting of the airport commissioners, telling them that the airport needed new runways and if they denied it, Mel would make sure that reporters and public knew how hypocrites they were.

Mel, the next day would move into a hotel now that he was getting divorce, also he questioned if his relationship with Tanya was going to be a friendship, one of a long lasting one. Other aircraft started to use runway three zero, he saw the landing lights of planes approaching, then he noticed that snow stopped falling, the storm had moving on.

1iz5bdg,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1iz5bdg/you_wanna_know_why_im_doing_this_he_whispered/,"“You wanna know why I’m doing this?” He whispered, about to swallow another needle.","Daryl grinned, opened his mouth, and planted a second three-inch needle onto his tongue, rolling it around the surface like a cherry stem he was preparing to tie into a knot. Left to right, right to left. Right to left, left to right. I followed the needle, helplessly transfixed by the rhythm of the movement.

After a few seconds, he let the needle rest, now sticky and shimmering with saliva. I met his gaze, shaking my head *no*. Wordlessly, I pleaded with him. Begged him to move out of the doorway and let me leave.

He tilted his head back slowly, letting the golden barb slide to the edge of his throat. All the while, he stared into my eyes, savoring the panic.

*“Please, Daryl, I don’t…I don’t understand…”*

For a moment, he seemed to come to his senses. Pivoted his jaw forward, placing his hand palm up in front of his mouth like he was going to spit the damn thing out. At the same time, the wildness in his features waned. The grin melted down his face like candlewax, and his lips stopped quavering.

I saw the tiniest hint of fear behind his eyes, too.

*“It’s okay, it’s okay… just give me my phone back…I can call an ambulan-”*

Before I could finish my sentence, he winked, licking his lips playfully, cradling the needle in his creased tongue as he did. In an instant, Daryl’s mania returned at a fever pitch.

When I realized he had only been toying with me, pretending to hear reason, my heart sank. He flung his thick jowls towards the ceiling like he was throwing back a shot of whiskey, and the needle disappeared down his throat.

His mouth sputtered, coughing and choking violently as the needle tore into his esophagus, blood rising up and pooling in his cheeks. The emotion driving his expressions seemed to flicker, quickly swapping from hysteria to fear and then back again in the blink of an eye. I couldn’t help but imagine the sharp tip of the needle dragging down the inside of his throat like a rock climber digging their axe into the downward slope of a mountain, trying to slow the speed of their descent.

*“Now I’ll ask you again, Lenny, do you-”* his sentence was interrupted by a bout of coughing so vicious that it caused him to double over, creating slightly more space between his body and the door that he had been blocking.

I bolted, reaching for the knob. Right as I was about to grasp it, he snapped his hip back, sandwiching my wrist between his waist and the metal frame.

A series of audible crunches filled the air, and agony detonated in my wrist like a pipe bomb.

I wailed and fell backwards on to the floor. The pain was unlike anything I’d experienced up to that point in my life; a vortex of fire and electricity churning in my forearm. Trying to stabilize the pulverized joint, I wrapped my other hand around my broken wrist, staring at it in disbelief.

Daryl stepped forward from the doorway. Looming over me, he bent down and gently put a meaty finger to my lips, shushing my howls. Reluctantly, my gaze lifted from my wrist to his eyes. When I finally quieted completely, he started anew.

*“You wanna know why I’m doing this, Lenny?”*

In his hand, he held out a black tin about the size of a matchbox, making a spectacle of showing me the details of the case like he was about to perform a magic trick. Golden stars and spirals covered the lid, forming a hypnotic pattern that straddled the line between purposeful and anarchic. He flicked the tin open with his thumb, revealing rows and rows of golden needles. They were thin, but that only made their ends appear sharper.

*“Please…Daryl…I don’t understand. Just stop. We can figure this out, please,”* I whimpered.

His pace accelerated.

Three more needles onto his tongue, swallowed, fingers back into the tin.

Five more needles onto his tongue, swallowed, blood and saliva oozing over his trembling lips.

On his last handful, Daryl didn’t even bother to lay them all in the same direction. Some were parallel to his tongue, others were horizontal; a bramble of tiny golden harpoons that fought back every step of the way as he attempted to force them down his throat.

He gulped, coughed, and wheezed, never looking away from me.

So, I finally gave in to his game. I asked him.

*“Why…why are you doing this?”*

Before he buckled over, blood spilling into the empty spaces in his abdomen from his stomach turned pin cushion, Daryl whispered the four words that have haunted me for the last half year.

Words that played on an endless loop in my mind, at the police station, in the courtroom; everywhere.

He wheezed and laughed, *“Because you* ***made*** *me.”*

\-------

Daryl and I were born on the same day, thousands of miles apart from each other. Cousins with very little in common.

But the coincidence of our births connected us.

Because it wasn’t *just* that we were born on the same day. We were born on the same day, in the same hour, with the same minute listed on both of birth certificates. It may have been the same second, too.

Of course, that’s impossible to prove.

Despite that bizarre synchronicity, our deliveries were quite different.

I was born full term, as planned, without a single complication. Thirty-eight weeks and a day of gestation, exactly as the doctor predicted. From what I’m told, my labor only lasted fifteen minutes. I was alive and breathing before the morphine could even be brought to the room to help my mother weather the contractions. Painless, punctual, and healthy.

Daryl was not blessed with my good fortune.

My cousin was born three months early, practically out of the blue and substantially underdeveloped. The doctors were baffled; my aunt had no risk factors for an extremely premature birth. Normally, there’s *some* identifiable reason for it, whether it be placental abnormalities, drug abuse or infection. But in his case, they couldn’t find a single thing.

He just…appeared. Exact same time as I did, down to the minute. Materialized from the pits of creation a whole season early so that we could cross that threshold together.

As you might imagine, babies born at twenty-six weeks of gestation don’t enter this world healthy.

He was physically underdeveloped for the demands of reality. Lungs don’t fully develop until at least *thirty-six* weeks, so he only existed for about a minute before a breathing tube needed to be placed down his throat. His blood vessels were exceptionally fragile, too. It was like blood was being transported through overcooked penne rather than strong, fibrous tubing. Because of that, he bled into his brain twelve hours after they put the breathing tube in.

I was born six pounds, two ounces. Daryl wasn’t even born with a pound to his name. Spent the first five months of his life in the neonatal intensive care unit, tethered to the location by the IVs and the feeding tubes like a dog leashed to a bike rack outside a bodega, waiting patiently for their owner to come back out with a pack of cigarettes so their life could continue.

Despite those hurdles, he lived. No long-term issues other than blindness in his left eye.

No biologic issues, at least.

The synchrony of our births became a family legend overnight. A story told over thanksgiving dinners, in grocery store parking lots, during the coffee break after Sunday Service. Over and over and over again until the flavor had been drained from the story; gum that had been chewed tasteless without being spat out. Because of that, no one treated us like cousins.

When Daryl and his family moved into my town, we were treated like twins, which introduced an element of competition between the two of us. An inevitable game of comparison perpetuated by our parents.

A game that I consistently won; not that I was looking to *beat* him at anything. I was just living my life.

My cousin never saw it that way, though.

\-------

As a kid, Daryl was quiet; reserved and a little socially awkward, but overall considered polite and well behaved.

That disposition was a mask that he put on for everyone but me. In mixed company, my cousin was a bashful titan. Despite his bumpy start in this life, he well surpassed my lanky frame before we were even toilet-trained.

But when we were alone, he dropped the act, and I got to see the strange hate that festered behind it all.

*“Why did you pull me out?”* he said, shoving an eight-year-old me to the floor of his bedroom.

I shrugged my shoulders and swiveled my head side to side, tears welling in my eyes.

*“I don’t…I don’t get what you mean,”* wiping the snot under my nose with the sleeve of my sweatshirt.

*“You know what I mean, Lenny. I was floating in the jelly, minding my own business. I wasn’t hurting you. I wasn’t hurting anyone. But you pulled me out. Reached inside what wasn’t yours and pulled me out. And now, I’m wrong. I feel wrong all the time. My heart beats backwards, not forwards. Part of my head is still in the jelly, and that hurts. The ink follows me. I can see it with my blind eye. Wakes me up at night.*

***Why did you do it?****”*

Every interaction I had with Daryl with no one else around was like this. Nonsense accusations paired with threats of physical violence. I dreaded the occasions where he’d be capable of getting me alone; holidays, birthdays, family reunions. They all inspired a burning, unspeakable worry that would smolder in my chest like a hot lump of coal.

Thankfully, as we aged, I gained agency over my life. If I didn’t want to be alone with Daryl, that was my choice. Once I was in High School, no one would just plop us in a room, close the door, and ask us to *play nice.*

Eventually, my unhinged cousin became a distant trauma, fading into the white noise of adult life. I moved out, went to college, then to law school. Got a good job. Paid for a nice condo with the money from that job.

From what my mom would tell me, Daryl still lived at home. Worked at a car wash. Still reserved, still quiet - still pleasant enough. Got in with the wrong crowd, though, apparently. Nothing to do with drugs, violence, or sex. It was something else. Despite being a notorious gossip, mom never gave me any details. All she ever told me was that it was really scaring my aunt.

After all that, she’d tell me how proud of me she was, and how she would brag to her friends about how much I made of myself.

She’d never *directly* say it, but mom only ever told me she was proud *after* expounding on how much of a fuck-up Daryl was. The implication was loud and clear; I was great, but I was *especially* great compared to my cousin, and that meant she was *better* than our aunt.

I hated my mom’s toxic pride. I pursued a career as a lawyer because I liked it, and it fulfilled me, but that didn’t make me any better than Daryl. Life is not a game of prestige. It felt fucked up to enjoy my position that much more on account of Daryl being seen as societally deficient, even if he tormented me as a child. I hoped that, whatever he was doing, however he was living his life, he was happy.

More than that, though, I hated the comparison because it linked me with him. I just wanted to be my own person, left alone.

When Daryl arrived on my doorstep with the tin of needles in his hand, I hadn’t seen or heard from him in over a decade.

\-------

Once he lost consciousness, I reached my uninjured hand into his jacket pocket to retrieve my phone.

*“9-1-1; what’s your emergency?”*

Minutes later, the EMTs rushed into my apartment and took over the resuscitation efforts, which was a tremendous relief. Between the shock, the terror, and the broken wrist, I’m sure my one-handed CPR was piss poor at best.

As I was stepping out the front door, escorted by one of the EMTs, I noticed something violently peculiar. Next to Daryl’s body, face now pale and blue from the blood loss, I spied the lid of the black tin lying next to his hand, but it looked different.

What I saw made no earthly sense. Initially, I attributed the discordance to a false memory, but I know now that what I noticed had significance, even if I still don’t understand exactly *what* that significance was as I type this.

The golden design that had been present on the tin only ten minutes prior was now gone. Vanished like it had never been there in the first place.

Hours later, discharged from the emergency room, wrist newly casted, I thought it was all over. I felt like I was free from him. He was dead, so the link was broken.

Finally, I'd be left alone.

I was sorely mistaken. Whatever Daryl had done, it continued despite his death.

Maybe even *because* of his death.

A sacrifice for a curse.

\-------

A day later, I opened my apartment door to find two detectives standing outside. They instructed me to follow them to their car. I needed to answer a few questions about my cousin’s death, and they requested I answered those questions at the police station.

Truthfully, though, it wasn’t a request. I was going to the station one way or the other. It was just a matter of how I was getting there and what shape I wanted to arrive in. I elected to avoid whatever force they had in mind if I refused and accompanied them to their idling sedan.

I wasn’t sure *what* they planned on asking me. Daryl arrived unannounced to my apartment, pulled my phone away from me before I could call 9-1-1, and then proceeded to ingest handfuls upon handfuls of sharp needles until he died from the internal bleeding. I didn’t know much more than that.

To my complete and absolute bewilderment, I was placed in an interrogation room when we arrived at the station.

I was the prime suspect in Daryl’s *murder*, and the detectives were looking for a confession.

*“Listen - we* *know* *you did this, Lenny.”* one detective shouted, slamming a hairy fist onto the metal table.

*“What the fuck are you talking about?? He swallowed the goddamned needles!”*

*“Yes! But…”* started the other detective.

*“You* ***made*** *him do it.”*

I leaned back in my chair, wide eyed, stunned into silence. These detectives were lunatics.

A second later, the hairy fisted detective parroted the statement. The same statement that Daryl had made right before he died.

*“Yes. You* ***made*** *him do it.”*

Initially, I wasn’t worried. Disturbed by the outlandish accusation, sure, but not worried. I went to law school. They had *zero* evidence, and I had no motive. None of it made a lick of sense. What was there to be concerned about?

That changed when I called my mother from the station’s pay phone.

*“Lenny…”* she sobbed into the receiver.

*“I can’t believe you* ***made*** *him do that.”*

Numbly, I hung up, listening to her tiny static wails as I placed the phone back on the hook.

The judge considered me a flight risk and therefore refused to offer bail.

So, I remained there. Trapped in the county jail, indicted for Daryl’s murder, with the only evidence against me the unanimous belief that I ***made*** *him do it.*

\-------

The trial was a sham; an absolute fucking travesty of justice.

I watched in horror as the prosecution called friends and family to the stand, who all had the same thing to say. An unending parade of baseless insanity.

*“He* ***made*** *him do it. I just know it.”*

When it was the defense’s turn, my lawyer didn’t even bother to call me to the stand. He just ceded to the prosecution.

*“Even I know Lenny* ***made*** *him do it.”* he claimed.

The judge then denied my request for self-representation.

I’ll save you all the details of my attempts to fight back. It’s unnecessary, and will only rile me up. I think, at this point, it would be obvious what the response was.

After three days of that, the jury didn’t even leave the room to deliberate. They looked at each other, shook their heads in near unison, and delivered their verdict.

*“We find the defendant guilty.”*

Without a second thought, the judge handed down his sentencing.

*“Twenty years to life. May God have mercy on your soul.”*

The gavel banged against the wood, its sound reverberating around the room like church bells before a hanging, and the bailiff ushered me out the door.

\-------

That was two months ago. Since then, I’ve spent my days adjusting to the nuances of a maximum security prison, appealing my verdict, and attempting to figure out what the hell Daryl did to everyone.

So far, no luck on any front. Courts have universally denied my appeals. Prison has been a near impossible adjustment. I still don’t understand the mechanics of what my cousin has done to me, not one bit.

Then, there was what happened a few nights ago.

A loud tapping jolted me awake. The familiar sound of a baton rapping on the closed window at the top of my cell door continued as I rubbed sleep from my eyes.

One of the correction officers then pulled down the cover, revealing only his chin. He called my name, demanding I report to the door, despite the fact that it must have been two or three in the morning.

I dangled my feet off the top bunk, lowering myself carefully onto the floor below, hoping not to incur my cell mate’s wrath by waking him up. He was a light sleeper.

In my groggy state, I misjudged the distance to the floor, rattling the bunk beds as I fell. My cell mate didn’t wake up. Not to the tapping, not to me falling, not to the miniature earthquake that traveled through the metal bed frame as I attempted to soften my fall.

Something was off.

I pulled myself up and tiptoed towards the door. As I approached, I couldn’t see the particular CO that was standing outside. There was just a disembodied jaw smiling at me through the partition.

When he spoke again, it wasn’t with the same voice he had used to call me over.

*“You do understand now, don’t ya Lenny?”*

I’d recognize that terrible melody anywhere. It’s a tune that bounced against the inside of my skull like a pinball, day in and day out.

*“D-Daryl? …how…”* I stuttered.

*“One more chance, Lenny. Do you understand?”*

In an instant, my heart raced and my blood began to boil. Sweat poured down my face. A veritable supernova of anger was rushing to the surface; fury that I had suppressed while I pleaded my innocence, trying to appear harmless. When it bloomed, I had no hope of controlling it.

“***FUCK YOU, DARYL,”*** I screamed, battering my fists against the steel door until they bled. I couldn’t help myself. That sentence exploded out of my mouth, again and again, hoping my undead cousin on the other side of the threshold would suffocate on the steam my screams created, killing him a second time.

When he responded, I think he said something like:

*“Alright, Lenny. Let’s try this again.”*

But I can’t be one-hundred percent sure. I was lost in an endless maze of pain and confusion.

Whatever was on the other side of the door closed the window latch and walked away. As it clicked, my cell mate began to yowl, gripping his stomach with both hands and falling out of bed.

It took about a minute for the *real* prison guards to hear his agony. During that time, I was confined in a small concrete box with the shrieking man.

As I watched him curl up into the fetal position and roll around the floor, I found myself imagining something strange.

I looked around my cell, and I imagined that I was trapped inside Daryl’s black tin. If I squinted, I could even see the golden stars and spirals that had disappeared from the lid of the tin, littering the walls like an intricate mural or the incoherent scribbling of a madman.

My cell mate died that night. Ruptured ulcer in his stomach, acid exploding over his intestines like a water balloon.

Naturally, the prison decided it was my fault.

They told me I ***made*** it happen.

Looks like I’ll be sentenced to another twenty years, maybe more.

I’m posting this from the prison’s computer lab to see if anyone *outside* my immediate orbit is unaffected by whatever Daryl has done.

What’s happening to me?

How do I escape it?

Or the next time Daryl appears; do I just tell him that I understand?

Even though I don’t.

Left to right, right to left. Right to left, left to right. I followed the needle, helplessly transfixed by the rhythm of the movement.

After a few seconds, he let the needle rest, now sticky and shimmering with saliva. I met his gaze, shaking my head *no*. Wordlessly, I pleaded with him. Begged him to move out of the doorway and let me leave.

He tilted his head back slowly, letting the golden barb slide to the edge of his throat. All the while, he stared into my eyes, savoring the panic.

*“Please, Daryl, I don’t…I don’t understand…”*

For a moment, he seemed to come to his senses. Pivoted his jaw forward, placing his hand palm up in front of his mouth like he was going to spit the damn thing out. At the same time, the wildness in his features waned. The grin melted down his face like candlewax, and his lips stopped quavering.

I saw the tiniest hint of fear behind his eyes, too.

*“It’s okay, it’s okay… just give me my phone back…I can call an ambulan-”*

Before I could finish my sentence, he winked, licking his lips playfully, cradling the needle in his creased tongue as he did. In an instant, Daryl’s mania returned at a fever pitch.

When I realized he had only been toying with me, pretending to hear reason, my heart sank. He flung his thick jowls towards the ceiling like he was throwing back a shot of whiskey, and the needle disappeared down his throat.

His mouth sputtered, coughing and choking violently as the needle tore into his esophagus, blood rising up and pooling in his cheeks. The emotion driving his expressions seemed to flicker, quickly swapping from hysteria to fear and then back again in the blink of an eye. I couldn’t help but imagine the sharp tip of the needle dragging down the inside of his throat like a rock climber digging their axe into the downward slope of a mountain, trying to slow the speed of their descent.

*“Now I’ll ask you again, Lenny, do you-”* his sentence was interrupted by a bout of coughing so vicious that it caused him to double over, creating slightly more space between his body and the door that he had been blocking.

I bolted, reaching for the knob. Right as I was about to grasp it, he snapped his hip back, sandwiching my wrist between his waist and the metal frame.

A series of audible crunches filled the air, and agony detonated in my wrist like a pipe bomb.

I wailed and fell backwards on to the floor. The pain was unlike anything I’d experienced up to that point in my life; a vortex of fire and electricity churning in my forearm. Trying to stabilize the pulverized joint, I wrapped my other hand around my broken wrist, staring at it in disbelief.

Daryl stepped forward from the doorway. Looming over me, he bent down and gently put a meaty finger to my lips, shushing my howls. Reluctantly, my gaze lifted from my wrist to his eyes. When I finally quieted completely, he started anew.

*“You wanna know why I’m doing this, Lenny?”*

He flicked the tin open with his thumb, revealing rows and rows of golden needles. They were thin, but that only made their ends appear sharper.

*“Please…Daryl…I don’t understand. Just stop. We can figure this out, please,”* I whimpered.

His pace accelerated.

Three more needles onto his tongue, swallowed, fingers back into the tin.

Five more needles onto his tongue, swallowed, blood and saliva oozing over his trembling lips.

On his last handful, Daryl didn’t even bother to lay them all in the same direction. Some were parallel to his tongue, others were horizontal; a bramble of tiny golden harpoons that fought back every step of the way as he attempted to force them down his throat.

He gulped, coughed, and wheezed, never looking away from me.

So, I finally gave in to his game. I asked him.

*“Why…why are you doing this?”*

Before he buckled over, blood spilling into the empty spaces in his abdomen from his stomach turned pin cushion, Daryl whispered the four words that have haunted me for the last half year.

*“Even I know Lenny* ***made*** *him do it.”* he claimed.

The judge then denied my request for self-representation.

I’ll save you all the details of my attempts to fight back. It’s unnecessary, and will only rile me up. I think, at this point, it would be obvious what the response was.

After three days of that, the jury didn’t even leave the room to deliberate. They looked at each other, shook their heads in near unison, and delivered their verdict.

*“We find the defendant guilty.”*

Without a second thought, the judge handed down his sentencing.

*“Twenty years to life. May God have mercy on your soul.”*

The gavel banged against the wood, its sound reverberating around the room like church bells before a hanging, and the bailiff ushered me out the door.

\-------

That was two months ago. Since then, I’ve spent my days adjusting to the nuances of a maximum security prison, appealing my verdict, and attempting to figure out what the hell Daryl did to everyone.

So far, no luck on any front. Courts have universally denied my appeals. Prison has been a near impossible adjustment. I still don’t understand the mechanics of what my cousin has done to me, not one bit.

Then, there was what happened a few nights ago.

A loud tapping jolted me awake. The familiar sound of a baton rapping on the closed window at the top of my cell door continued as I rubbed sleep from my eyes.

One of the correction officers then pulled down the cover, revealing only his chin. He called my name, demanding I report to the door, despite the fact that it must have been two or three in the morning.

I dangled my feet off the top bunk, lowering myself carefully onto the floor below, hoping not to incur my cell mate’s wrath by waking him up. He was a light sleeper.

In my groggy state, I misjudged the distance to the floor, rattling the bunk beds as I fell. My cell mate didn’t wake up. Not to the tapping, not to me falling, not to the miniature earthquake that traveled through the metal bed frame as I attempted to soften my fall.

Something was off.

I pulled myself up and tiptoed towards the door. As I approached, I couldn’t see the particular CO that was standing outside. There was just a disembodied jaw smiling at me through the partition.

When he spoke again, it wasn’t with the same voice he had used to call me over.

*“You do understand now, don’t ya Lenny?”*

I’d recognize that terrible melody anywhere. It’s a tune that bounced against the inside of my skull like a pinball, day in and day out.

*“D-Daryl? …how…”* I stuttered.

*“One more chance, Lenny. Do you understand?”*

In an instant, my heart raced and my blood began to boil. Sweat poured down my face. A veritable supernova of anger was rushing to the surface; fury that I had suppressed while I pleaded my innocence, trying to appear harmless. When it bloomed, I had no hope of controlling it.

“***FUCK YOU, DARYL,”*** I screamed, battering my fists against the steel door until they bled. I couldn’t help myself. That sentence exploded out of my mouth, again and again, hoping my undead cousin on the other side of the threshold would suffocate on the steam my screams created, killing him a second time.

When he responded, I think he said something like:

*“Alright, Lenny. Let’s try this again.”*

But I can’t be one-hundred percent sure. I was lost in an endless maze of pain and confusion.

Whatever was on the other side of the door closed the window latch and walked away. As it clicked, my cell mate began to yowl, gripping his stomach with both hands and falling out of bed.

It took about a minute for the *real* prison guards to hear his agony. During that time, I was confined in a small concrete box with the shrieking man.

As I watched him curl up into the fetal position and roll around the floor, I found myself imagining something strange.

I looked around my cell, and I imagined that I was trapped inside Daryl’s black tin. If I squinted, I could even see the golden stars and spirals that had disappeared from the lid of the tin, littering the walls like an intricate mural or the incoherent scribbling of a madman.

My cell mate died that night. Ruptured ulcer in his stomach, acid exploding over his intestines like a water balloon.

Naturally, the prison decided it was my fault.

They told me I ***made*** it happen.

Looks like I’ll be sentenced to another twenty years, maybe more.

I’m posting this from the prison’s computer lab to see if anyone *outside* my immediate orbit is unaffected by whatever Daryl has done.

What’s happening to me?

How do I escape it?

Or the next time Daryl appears; do I just tell him that I understand?

Even though I don’t.

And, God, I don’t think I [ever will.](https://www.reddit.com/r/unalloyedsainttrina/)",3,1740623415.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

It was January, and on Friday at half past sex the Lincoln international airport was hit by the worst storm, as well as the entire midwestern United states. it lasted three days and there were problems, like a truck carrying two hundred dinners was lost or hundred of flights delayed and the runway three zero was out if use for an aero mexican plane that lay sideways across it with its front wheels stuck in the deep mud which lay under the snow near the edge of the runway. aeromexico couldn't take it off so they called TWA. With the runway closed and flights delayed, a lot of passengers were impatiently waiting. 

Mel Bakersfeld, the airport general manager, was surprised that the airport was still open. He could tell from the snow control desk that maintenance men with snow plows tried to clear the snow, but they got tired fast.

Danny Farrow was at the snow control desk talking to the phone trying to get more maintenance men that could clear the snow, but Danny seemed to lose his temper because their search would block the services road and plenty of complaints. 

Mel phoned Air traffic control, asking if there was any progress but there was none. Mel knew that the airport needed more runways even though many people disagreed with him. Also, planes were taking off over Meadowood, even though the airport had been built before building houses. with the runaway blocked and the compliments it seemed that that would be a lot of troubles.

Mel asked for Keith, Mel's brother who worked in Air traffic control. Recently Mel was worried about him.  After the call, mel took a note received by Tanya livingstone, she worked for Trans america as the passengers relations agent and a special friend of mel’s. The note said that the Airlines snow committee, led by captain Vernon Demesters, wanted to blame him for all the delayed flights. Vernon Demester was one of the most experienced pilots, he was married to Mel's sister, but they were not friendly with each other, they had exchanged angry words at a meeting. Mel wasn't worried because he tried to do his best, but the criticism behind his back was what bothered him. At the end of the note Tanya invited him to have a cup of coffee.



***CHAPTER 2***

Mel went to his office, it was silent and empty, took command and fur lined boots. He didn't have too much to do, he wasn't on duty, but he thought he needed to stay to help. Which was a lie he told himself so he couldn't go home. The airport kept him busy, and also was an escape from all his fights with his wife Cindy. He had promised Cindy to go to a party that evening with Cindy, and she hated to miss a party. He called his home, one of his daughters Roberta picked up. she talked to him in a cold, bothered tone, mel didnt like that. he asked for cindy but she went out. Then his other daughter Libby talked, she was seven years old, and Mel wanted to keep her like that. When the call ended he walked out of his office and the hall of the main terminal was crowded with impatient, worried and angry people. he walked to Tanya’s office 

  
  
  
  
  


***CHAPTER 3***

Tanka was having a situation in his office where a girl Pasty smith from Trans america ticket was crying in her office, a man had missed his flight and they couldn't find another place where to put the man, and when patsy find him a place he complained about the movie it would shown on the flight, so the man started to tell her horrible thing and patsy couldn't handle it not more and threw him a book. Tanya told her that she agreed with what she did but that that couldn't happen again tfc. Patsy went out and Mel came into the office. They walked to get coffee when Mel asked to have dinner at her place. Mel wondered if that could lead up to a love affair. She invited him on sunday. The coffee shop was full of people, they went to sit down and Mel almost fell and seized Tanya's arm. They became closer when Mel made a speech to the airport operators council. While they were talking Mel saw a good looking man, that man was taking flight two to Rome, ‘’the golden argosy’’, and Vernon demester was going to pilot it. Then they talked about marriage and divorce. Tanya was married to a man that left her after her first daughter was born. 

They were leaving the coffee shop, and Mel phoned The snow desk. Danny told him that the aereo mexicano was still stuck in the runway, so they called TWA and they would send Joe patron, the only man that could possibly move it.

Then someone gabe Tanya a message that a stowaway was found on a flight from Los Angeles, so Tanya and Mel would be around each other.



***CHAPTER 4***

Joe Patroni was on his way to the airport, he got into his car and drove slowly, the snow was thick and there was traffic. Joe started working as a motor mechanic in a garage until he won an old airplane in a card game, he repaired it on his own and taught himself how to fly it, studied at night and went to work for TWA as a airplane mechanic. he was the best, everyone called him whether was a problem, he didn't waste time and always said what he was thinking. Then, he became TWA chief maintenance at Lincoln International, he married a hostess named Marie for twelve years and had three childrens.

He waited in his car, but he decided to get out to see what was happening. There was an accident, a sixteen wheeler was lying on its side in the road, the police tried to move it with a breakdown truck. He walked towards the police and said that they would never move it, so ten minutes later Joe was in charge and everyone was listening to him. More trucks were on their way to help and Joe started to get worried about the situation at the airport, he came back to his car and Mel Bakersfield left a message that the runway three zero was urgently needed, the snow was still thick but at least the two breakdows trucks arrived.



***CHAPTER 5***

Mel went to his car, which had its own two way radio. The wind was freezing and storming, he drove out to the airfield, he could see several planes waiting to take off. The radio had messages passing between aircraft and ground control, the controller sounded tired and that made him think of Keith. He reached the runway, and he met Ingram, the aereo mexican maintenance supervisor, his face blue for the cold. He told me that all the passengers had been taken off the plane, he needed to do it quickly. Mel felt something was going to happen, so he called Danny Farrow asking for Patroni, but he would be there for another hour. Also Mel's wife Cindy had phoned again, probably angry.

  


***CHAPTER 6***

Captain Vernon demerest was three miles from the airport, driving his Mercedes to a large apartment block where parties were held and love affairs between pilots and hostess. Demerest had had a large number of affairs with hostesses, but that night he was going to visit a dark haired english girl, Gwen meighen a farmer daughter that came to america ten years ago, she was a fashion model before becoming an air hostess. 

They would fly to Rome together in the Golden Argosy, and spend three days in Italy, Vernon was happy with the thought of that. He arrived at the airport early, he said goodbye to his dull and quiet wife, their marriage was built by not asking questions about his affairs. Also he was happy about the recent report the airlines snow committee had made to mel bakersfield. 

He arrived earlier at the apartment, he could imagine the warm night and soft music of Naples with Gwen. Vernon would fly alongside the pilot Captain Anson Harris, he was a little less experienced than vernon.  the other pilots hated to be checked by vernon, he seemed to try to find fault with them, he made captain harris angry, telephoning to him remind him not to be late and when the met told harris to wear the TWA shirt, when harris realized he was not joking he went all red and angry. 

He arrived at Gwen’s apartment, knocked it and he could hear her soft and attractive voice. She invited inside for some tea and talked to him about something important. He went in smiling.



***CHAPTER 7***

The wind got stronger and stronger, as Mel drove to runway one seven, he was freezing but also of his memories. He had a pain in his foot during the Korean war sixteen years ago. He had the feeling that something was going to happen and the next day his plane shot down into the sea.  His foot was trapped so he cut his foot to free himself, and since that day he would never be able to fly a plane again.

Lincoln international had five runways and only two of them were in use, and since the storm began men worked on the runways, those men were trying their hardest even though people don't know how much effort they put in this. A man called me to have a ride in the snowplow, and he accepted. He climbed and sat beside the man called Will. He liked to be in the airfield, that was the place he needed to go to think about everything.



***CHAPTER 8***

Lincoln international was the modern airport years ago, but nowadays it has failed to be modern. It needed more adjustments like more runways because one runway cut across another two, that made the planes that took off and landed crossed very closely to each other and that something air traffic control knew. Also, Keitt told me that one day there would be a crash if no one did anything.

Mel had not thought about that when he saw it with his eyes, how the two planes seemed to almost crashed into each other. He spoke to the airport commissioners and to the city council about more runways; the people who controlled the airport didn't listen to him. mel let the snowplow and went back to the terminal  thinking when he was president of the airport operators council, made a amazing speech about the future of air transport and then the next day he was invited to the white house to meet the president kennedy, they talked and he asked mel advices, and the next day kennedy was killed, he felt he lost a friend.

Mel reached the terminal and spoke to Danny Farrow if there was any update about the aereo mexican but there was nothing new, Danny asked Mel about the party, he forgot to call cindy. He phoned her, and she picked up asking why he wasn't there, she had an angry voice. They started arguing about Mel trying to make it on time but Cindy contradicted that he should have been out of his job hours ago. Mel started to get hot from anger, he didn't want to explode so he tried to calm himself, then Cindy put a limit saying that if he didn't want to leave the airport that that would be the end of their marriage. she rang off.

walking back to his office angry at himself, because thinking how he messed up many times before, at his office he threw his coat, lit a cigarette but immediately put it out. he still was thinking of cindy and his marriage went downhill when his telephone rang, it was air traffic control saying that they had a emergency.



***CHAPTER 9***

Keith Bakersfield was on duty in the air traffic control, he was in the radar room. The storm had a big effect in the radar room. Unlike the other air traffic control rooms, the radar room had no windows and the controllers worked under low lights.

in the radar screen appeared a single like a green flower, that represented an aircraft in trouble, it was the US air force KC-135, was flying above the airport and asked for immediate landing. Keith saw the signal appear first, then a supervisor had come to help Keith and both send urgent messages to other controllers and buy radio to other aircraft. 

The screen  showed bright points of lights, those were the planes that were in the air, and that night the screen was full of them. Keith was nervous. The supervisor, Wayne Tevis, told Keith that Braniff flight was getting close to Eastern, and Keith had to turn Braniff right so the Eastern could keep on his course. The problems Keith and others controllers had was that they were working  to clear a path for the Air force KC-135 to land, and other planes were circulating up in the sky, and also the contact with the plane had been lost.

He spoke to Braniff nervously to make a right turn, then Keith kept saying to other planes new courses. Wayne tried to contact the 135. The green signal showed that the pilot was doing the right thing, that there was a clear path for him. Around Keith everyone was talking, exhausted, he had been one of the best, and that night he didn't want to make mistakes because later that night he would be dead. 

Wayne told Keith to take a break just because he didn't trust Keith, left the room and went to a small rest room to think clearly. lit a cigarette and took out some food his wife, Natalie, had prepared for him. Recently their marriage looked hopeless, without energy. He took a photo of her wife, he loved her but he only felt despair. He thought about Mel and how none of them could help Keith. When he came off duty he would go to a hotel and soon he would be dead.



***CHAPTER 10***

A meeting was being held in a church in Meadowood. It started late because of the storm outside. They were the amount of people that lived in a small town (kinda the town of Gilmore Girls), most of them were formally dressed, and also newspaper reporters were there. people were sitting as well as standing, the people seemed angry at the noise they heard night and day and that moment the noise of the planes taking off made it impossible for them to hear. but they didnt know one runway was closed, and then they had to use the one closer to the town. The chairman said that it was impossible to live with all that noise, but the people had already complained about the noise and that the airport had taken notice of them. 

The chairman was a sixty years old manager of a printing company called Floyd Zanneta and alongside him there was a younger man, a lawyer called Elliot Freemantel. 

Floyd shouted that the airport would do anything about the noise and that they were cheats and liars, he tried to keep talking but the noise of the planes interrupted. The people wanted to know what to do about that situation. Floyd said that they should not be polite any longer, he had brought Elliot Freemantel, a lawyer that made special study of those types of cases.

Elliot just wanted the old man to shut up, Elliot had not made any special study of any cases, he just wanted to show himself like he knew what he was doing, he just wanted to make money. Once Floyd ended to talk Elliot stand up, he talked with such a confidence that make everyone in the room listened to him, he said he wanted to help him and bring them justice. he told them that in many cases the airport could be taken to court by ordinary people like them, and they could win, and the airport could be forced to pay them a large amount of money, and if they lose it wouldn't matter because in most cases they lose, and Elliot didn't care if they win, he just wanted the money they would pay him, and it would be twenty five thousand dollar. they just needed to sign the papers. Everyone agreed with Elliot, and they signed the papers that hired him as their lawyer.



***CHAPTER 11***

When Elliot was talking to the town, a former builder called D.O Guerrero was tasting the bitterness of failure. He was in a poor, dirty apartment fifteen miles from the airport. He was a thin, sickly sort of man, with an unhealthy yellowish face, deep hollows around his eyes and pale thin lips, he was losing balls and had shaky hands, he had fifty. 

He was married to Inez, for several years they were happy but however he felt they grew apart and couldn't share things with each other, his family was poor, mostly because of his business failures. They had to move from their cozy home to another cheaper place. Inez could bear living like that, but with Guerrero’s changed temperament it was hard to talk to him. One time he had hit her in the face, he had not apologized or talked about it. Inez sent his two children with her sister and took a job as a waitress because they really needed the money, Guerrero was at that department and inez was at work, he had bought a ticket for Trans America Flight Two to Rome, it cost four hundred and seventy four dollars and he paid only forty seven something he promised he would paid later but he wouldn't, he sold inez mom’s ring to get the money. 

Guerrero was ruined with a lot of debts going on, he would be arrested if they found his business deals, they would be homeless soon if they didn't get the money on time. Although he had a plan to get money, he would blow up trans america flight two, and he would be there in the flight. He had taken out life insurance for seventy five thousand dollars and his family. He had been thinking about his death for several months, studied similar cases and how to make it perfect. 

The plane should disappear and be high above the atlantic ocean, if it exploded there the pieces would disappear. He had made a small and simple bomb made by hand that would fit into a suitcase, he had only pulled a string and the bomb would explode.

He got ready to go to the airport, he had enough money to get there and buy an insurance policy. He left a note to Inez saying that he wouldn't be home for a few days and then he left the apartment.

  
  


***CHAPTER 12***

 Joe Patroni was still trying to move the big vehicle blocking the way, he phoned the airport and the Aereo Mexican was still crossing the runway. He went back to the group of people, three more breakdown trucks arrived, and a cameraman arrived. When he phoned the airport the breakdown trucks had their chain in the sixteen wheeler to pull it out but when he came back the chains were gone.

Joe asked who did that but the policeman said that it looked better on television without the chains. Joe started to get really annoyed but he had to control his temper. He argued with the police saying to pull back the chains or he would send the information of what he did to the policeman chief. He did so and made the cameras go away. He let Joe direct the operation and the bradowns trucks were pulling the heavy goods vehicle off the road and snow plows moved quickly to clear the road, Joe walked back to his car.

So I'm 10 months post partum, and this past week I had the most debilitating fatigue the week before my period. Like pure exhaustion all day, sleeping the second my head hits the pillow, can't get off the couch, fatigue. I can't drink more caffeine to fix it or I'll get anxiety. I only have one cup of coffee when I wake up. 
I was on the nexplanon for a bit after my son was born but I got it taken out due to mood changes and I never stopped bleeding the 4 months I was on it. So this would be either my second or third cycle off of the nexplanon. 
Both my kids wake up a bunch, but I get about 5 hours a night, maybe less, and I usually feel just fine. My body has become accustomed to the sleep deprivation haha. 
So my question is my upcoming period induced extreme fatigue normal???? How do I give myself more energy without caffeine?? ",1,1740623373.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

Left to right, right to left. Right to left, left to right. I followed the needle, helplessly transfixed by the rhythm of the movement.

After a few seconds, he let the needle rest, now sticky and shimmering with saliva. I met his gaze, shaking my head *no*. Wordlessly, I pleaded with him. Begged him to move out of the doorway and let me leave.

He tilted his head back slowly, letting the golden barb slide to the edge of his throat. All the while, he stared into my eyes, savoring the panic.

*“Please, Daryl, I don’t…I don’t understand…”*

For a moment, he seemed to come to his senses. Pivoted his jaw forward, placing his hand palm up in front of his mouth like he was going to spit the damn thing out. At the same time, the wildness in his features waned. The grin melted down his face like candlewax, and his lips stopped quavering.

I saw the tiniest hint of fear behind his eyes, too.

*“It’s okay, it’s okay… just give me my phone back…I can call an ambulan-”*

Before I could finish my sentence, he winked, licking his lips playfully, cradling the needle in his creased tongue as he did. In an instant, Daryl’s mania returned at a fever pitch.

When I realized he had only been toying with me, pretending to hear reason, my heart sank. He flung his thick jowls towards the ceiling like he was throwing back a shot of whiskey, and the needle disappeared down his throat.

His mouth sputtered, coughing and choking violently as the needle tore into his esophagus, blood rising up and pooling in his cheeks. The emotion driving his expressions seemed to flicker, quickly swapping from hysteria to fear and then back again in the blink of an eye. I couldn’t help but imagine the sharp tip of the needle dragging down the inside of his throat like a rock climber digging their axe into the downward slope of a mountain, trying to slow the speed of their descent.

*“Now I’ll ask you again, Lenny, do you-”* his sentence was interrupted by a bout of coughing so vicious that it caused him to double over, creating slightly more space between his body and the door that he had been blocking.

I bolted, reaching for the knob. Right as I was about to grasp it, he snapped his hip back, sandwiching my wrist between his waist and the metal frame.

A series of audible crunches filled the air, and agony detonated in my wrist like a pipe bomb.

I wailed and fell backwards on to the floor. The pain was unlike anything I’d experienced up to that point in my life; a vortex of fire and electricity churning in my forearm. Trying to stabilize the pulverized joint, I wrapped my other hand around my broken wrist, staring at it in disbelief.

Daryl stepped forward from the doorway. Looming over me, he bent down and gently put a meaty finger to my lips, shushing my howls. Reluctantly, my gaze lifted from my wrist to his eyes. When I finally quieted completely, he started anew.

*“You wanna know why I’m doing this, Lenny?”*

In his hand, he held out a black tin about the size of a matchbox, making a spectacle of showing me the details of the case like he was about to perform a magic trick. Golden stars and spirals covered the lid, forming a hypnotic pattern that straddled the line between purposeful and anarchic. He flicked the tin open with his thumb, revealing rows and rows of golden needles. They were thin, but that only made their ends appear sharper.

*“Please…Daryl…I don’t understand. Just stop. We can figure this out, please,”* I whimpered.

His pace accelerated.

Three more needles onto his tongue, swallowed, fingers back into the tin.

Five more needles onto his tongue, swallowed, blood and saliva oozing over his trembling lips.

On his last handful, Daryl didn’t even bother to lay them all in the same direction. Some were parallel to his tongue, others were horizontal; a bramble of tiny golden harpoons that fought back every step of the way as he attempted to force them down his throat.

He gulped, coughed, and wheezed, never looking away from me.

So, I finally gave in to his game. I asked him.

*“Why…why are you doing this?”*

Before he buckled over, blood spilling into the empty spaces in his abdomen from his stomach turned pin cushion, Daryl whispered the four words that have haunted me for the last half year.

Words that played on an endless loop in my mind, at the police station, in the courtroom; everywhere.

He wheezed and laughed, *“Because you* ***made*** *me.”*

\-------

Daryl and I were born on the same day, thousands of miles apart from each other. Cousins with very little in common.

But the coincidence of our births connected us.

Because it wasn’t *just* that we were born on the same day. We were born on the same day, in the same hour, with the same minute listed on both of birth certificates. It may have been the same second, too.

Of course, that’s impossible to prove.

Despite that bizarre synchronicity, our deliveries were quite different.

I was born full term, as planned, without a single complication. Thirty-eight weeks and a day of gestation, exactly as the doctor predicted. From what I’m told, my labor only lasted fifteen minutes. I was alive and breathing before the morphine could even be brought to the room to help my mother weather the contractions. Painless, punctual, and healthy.

Daryl was not blessed with my good fortune.

My cousin was born three months early, practically out of the blue and substantially underdeveloped. The doctors were baffled; my aunt had no risk factors for an extremely premature birth. Normally, there’s *some* identifiable reason for it, whether it be placental abnormalities, drug abuse or infection. But in his case, they couldn’t find a single thing.

He just…appeared. Exact same time as I did, down to the minute. Materialized from the pits of creation a whole season early so that we could cross that threshold together.

As you might imagine, babies born at twenty-six weeks of gestation don’t enter this world healthy.

He was physically underdeveloped for the demands of reality. Lungs don’t fully develop until at least *thirty-six* weeks, so he only existed for about a minute before a breathing tube needed to be placed down his throat. His blood vessels were exceptionally fragile, too. It was like blood was being transported through overcooked penne rather than strong, fibrous tubing. Because of that, he bled into his brain twelve hours after they put the breathing tube in.

I was born six pounds, two ounces. Daryl wasn’t even born with a pound to his name. Spent the first five months of his life in the neonatal intensive care unit, tethered to the location by the IVs and the feeding tubes like a dog leashed to a bike rack outside a bodega, waiting patiently for their owner to come back out with a pack of cigarettes so their life could continue.

Despite those hurdles, he lived. No long-term issues other than blindness in his left eye.

No biologic issues, at least.

The synchrony of our births became a family legend overnight. A story told over thanksgiving dinners, in grocery store parking lots, during the coffee break after Sunday Service. Over and over and over again until the flavor had been drained from the story; gum that had been chewed tasteless without being spat out. Because of that, no one treated us like cousins.

When Daryl and his family moved into my town, we were treated like twins, which introduced an element of competition between the two of us. An inevitable game of comparison perpetuated by our parents.

A game that I consistently won; not that I was looking to *beat* him at anything. I was just living my life.

My cousin never saw it that way, though.

\-------

As a kid, Daryl was quiet; reserved and a little socially awkward, but overall considered polite and well behaved.

That disposition was a mask that he put on for everyone but me. In mixed company, my cousin was a bashful titan. Despite his bumpy start in this life, he well surpassed my lanky frame before we were even toilet-trained.

But when we were alone, he dropped the act, and I got to see the strange hate that festered behind it all.

*“Why did you pull me out?”* he said, shoving an eight-year-old me to the floor of his bedroom.

I shrugged my shoulders and swiveled my head side to side, tears welling in my eyes.

*“I don’t…I don’t get what you mean,”* wiping the snot under my nose with the sleeve of my sweatshirt.

*“You know what I mean, Lenny. I was floating in the jelly, minding my own business. I wasn’t hurting you. I wasn’t hurting anyone. But you pulled me out. Reached inside what wasn’t yours and pulled me out. And now, I’m wrong. I feel wrong all the time. My heart beats backwards, not forwards. Part of my head is still in the jelly, and that hurts. The ink follows me. I can see it with my blind eye. Wakes me up at night.*

***Why did you do it?****”*

Every interaction I had with Daryl with no one else around was like this. Nonsense accusations paired with threats of physical violence. I dreaded the occasions where he’d be capable of getting me alone; holidays, birthdays, family reunions. They all inspired a burning, unspeakable worry that would smolder in my chest like a hot lump of coal.

Thankfully, as we aged, I gained agency over my life. If I didn’t want to be alone with Daryl, that was my choice. Once I was in High School, no one would just plop us in a room, close the door, and ask us to *play nice.*

Eventually, my unhinged cousin became a distant trauma, fading into the white noise of adult life. I moved out, went to college, then to law school. Got a good job. Paid for a nice condo with the money from that job.

From what my mom would tell me, Daryl still lived at home. Worked at a car wash. Still reserved, still quiet - still pleasant enough. Got in with the wrong crowd, though, apparently. Nothing to do with drugs, violence, or sex. It was something else. Despite being a notorious gossip, mom never gave me any details. All she ever told me was that it was really scaring my aunt.

After all that, she’d tell me how proud of me she was, and how she would brag to her friends about how much I made of myself.

She’d never *directly* say it, but mom only ever told me she was proud *after* expounding on how much of a fuck-up Daryl was. The implication was loud and clear; I was great, but I was *especially* great compared to my cousin, and that meant she was *better* than our aunt.

I hated my mom’s toxic pride. I pursued a career as a lawyer because I liked it, and it fulfilled me, but that didn’t make me any better than Daryl. Life is not a game of prestige. It felt fucked up to enjoy my position that much more on account of Daryl being seen as societally deficient, even if he tormented me as a child. I hoped that, whatever he was doing, however he was living his life, he was happy.

More than that, though, I hated the comparison because it linked me with him. I just wanted to be my own person, left alone.

When Daryl arrived on my doorstep with the tin of needles in his hand, I hadn’t seen or heard from him in over a decade.

\-------

Once he lost consciousness, I reached my uninjured hand into his jacket pocket to retrieve my phone.

*“9-1-1; what’s your emergency?”*

Minutes later, the EMTs rushed into my apartment and took over the resuscitation efforts, which was a tremendous relief. Between the shock, the terror, and the broken wrist, I’m sure my one-handed CPR was piss poor at best.

As I was stepping out the front door, escorted by one of the EMTs, I noticed something violently peculiar. Next to Daryl’s body, face now pale and blue from the blood loss, I spied the lid of the black tin lying next to his hand, but it looked different.

What I saw made no earthly sense. Initially, I attributed the discordance to a false memory, but I know now that what I noticed had significance, even if I still don’t understand exactly *what* that significance was as I type this.

The golden design that had been present on the tin only ten minutes prior was now gone. Vanished like it had never been there in the first place.

Hours later, discharged from the emergency room, wrist newly casted, I thought it was all over. I felt like I was free from him. He was dead, so the link was broken.

Finally, I'd be left alone.

I was sorely mistaken. Whatever Daryl had done, it continued despite his death.

Maybe even *because* of his death.

A sacrifice for a curse.

\-------

A day later, I opened my apartment door to find two detectives standing outside. They instructed me to follow them to their car. I needed to answer a few questions about my cousin’s death, and they requested I answered those questions at the police station.

Truthfully, though, it wasn’t a request. I was going to the station one way or the other. It was just a matter of how I was getting there and what shape I wanted to arrive in. I elected to avoid whatever force they had in mind if I refused and accompanied them to their idling sedan.

I wasn’t sure *what* they planned on asking me. Daryl arrived unannounced to my apartment, pulled my phone away from me before I could call 9-1-1, and then proceeded to ingest handfuls upon handfuls of sharp needles until he died from the internal bleeding. I didn’t know much more than that.

To my complete and absolute bewilderment, I was placed in an interrogation room when we arrived at the station.

I was the prime suspect in Daryl’s *murder*, and the detectives were looking for a confession.

*“Listen - we* *know* *you did this, Lenny.”* one detective shouted, slamming a hairy fist onto the metal table.

*“What the fuck are you talking about?? He swallowed the goddamned needles!”*

*“Yes! But…”* started the other detective.

*“You* ***made*** *him do it.”*

I leaned back in my chair, wide eyed, stunned into silence. These detectives were lunatics.

A second later, the hairy fisted detective parroted the statement. The same statement that Daryl had made right before he died.

*“Yes. You* ***made*** *him do it.”*

Initially, I wasn’t worried. Disturbed by the outlandish accusation, sure, but not worried. I went to law school. They had *zero* evidence, and I had no motive. None of it made a lick of sense. What was there to be concerned about?

That changed when I called my mother from the station’s pay phone.

*“Lenny…”* she sobbed into the receiver.

*“I can’t believe you* ***made*** *him do that.”*

Numbly, I hung up, listening to her tiny static wails as I placed the phone back on the hook.

The judge considered me a flight risk and therefore refused to offer bail.

So, I remained there. Trapped in the county jail, indicted for Daryl’s murder, with the only evidence against me the unanimous belief that I ***made*** *him do it.*

\-------

The trial was a sham; an absolute fucking travesty of justice.

I watched in horror as the prosecution called friends and family to the stand, who all had the same thing to say. An unending parade of baseless insanity.

*“He* ***made*** *him do it. I just know it.”*

When it was the defense’s turn, my lawyer didn’t even bother to call me to the stand. He just ceded to the prosecution.

*“Even I know Lenny* ***made*** *him do it.”* he claimed.

The judge then denied my request for self-representation.

I’ll save you all the details of my attempts to fight back. It’s unnecessary, and will only rile me up. I think, at this point, it would be obvious what the response was.

After three days of that, the jury didn’t even leave the room to deliberate. They looked at each other, shook their heads in near unison, and delivered their verdict.

*“We find the defendant guilty.”*

Without a second thought, the judge handed down his sentencing.

*“Twenty years to life. May God have mercy on your soul.”*

The gavel banged against the wood, its sound reverberating around the room like church bells before a hanging, and the bailiff ushered me out the door.

\-------

That was two months ago. Since then, I’ve spent my days adjusting to the nuances of a maximum security prison, appealing my verdict, and attempting to figure out what the hell Daryl did to everyone.

So far, no luck on any front. Courts have universally denied my appeals. Prison has been a near impossible adjustment. I still don’t understand the mechanics of what my cousin has done to me, not one bit.

Then, there was what happened a few nights ago.

A loud tapping jolted me awake. The familiar sound of a baton rapping on the closed window at the top of my cell door continued as I rubbed sleep from my eyes.

One of the correction officers then pulled down the cover, revealing only his chin. He called my name, demanding I report to the door, despite the fact that it must have been two or three in the morning.

I dangled my feet off the top bunk, lowering myself carefully onto the floor below, hoping not to incur my cell mate’s wrath by waking him up. He was a light sleeper.

In my groggy state, I misjudged the distance to the floor, rattling the bunk beds as I fell. My cell mate didn’t wake up. Not to the tapping, not to me falling, not to the miniature earthquake that traveled through the metal bed frame as I attempted to soften my fall.

Something was off.

I pulled myself up and tiptoed towards the door. As I approached, I couldn’t see the particular CO that was standing outside. There was just a disembodied jaw smiling at me through the partition.

When he spoke again, it wasn’t with the same voice he had used to call me over.

*“You do understand now, don’t ya Lenny?”*

I’d recognize that terrible melody anywhere. It’s a tune that bounced against the inside of my skull like a pinball, day in and day out.

*“D-Daryl? …how…”* I stuttered.

*“One more chance, Lenny. Do you understand?”*

In an instant, my heart raced and my blood began to boil. Sweat poured down my face. A veritable supernova of anger was rushing to the surface; fury that I had suppressed while I pleaded my innocence, trying to appear harmless. When it bloomed, I had no hope of controlling it.

“***FUCK YOU, DARYL,”*** I screamed, battering my fists against the steel door until they bled. I couldn’t help myself. That sentence exploded out of my mouth, again and again, hoping my undead cousin on the other side of the threshold would suffocate on the steam my screams created, killing him a second time.

When he responded, I think he said something like:

*“Alright, Lenny. Let’s try this again.”*

But I can’t be one-hundred percent sure. I was lost in an endless maze of pain and confusion.

Whatever was on the other side of the door closed the window latch and walked away. As it clicked, my cell mate began to yowl, gripping his stomach with both hands and falling out of bed.

It took about a minute for the *real* prison guards to hear his agony. During that time, I was confined in a small concrete box with the shrieking man.

As I watched him curl up into the fetal position and roll around the floor, I found myself imagining something strange.

I looked around my cell, and I imagined that I was trapped inside Daryl’s black tin. If I squinted, I could even see the golden stars and spirals that had disappeared from the lid of the tin, littering the walls like an intricate mural or the incoherent scribbling of a madman.

My cell mate died that night. Ruptured ulcer in his stomach, acid exploding over his intestines like a water balloon.

Naturally, the prison decided it was my fault.

They told me I ***made*** it happen.

Looks like I’ll be sentenced to another twenty years, maybe more.

I’m posting this from the prison’s computer lab to see if anyone *outside* my immediate orbit is unaffected by whatever Daryl has done.

What’s happening to me?

How do I escape it?

Or the next time Daryl appears; do I just tell him that I understand?

Even though I don’t.

And, God, I don’t think I [ever will.](https://www.reddit.com/r/unalloyedsainttrina/)",2,1740623345.0,TheCrypticCompendium,0,1.0,False

Left to right, right to left. Right to left, left to right. I followed the needle, helplessly transfixed by the rhythm of the movement.

After a few seconds, he let the needle rest, now sticky and shimmering with saliva. I met his gaze, shaking my head *no*. Wordlessly, I pleaded with him. Begged him to move out of the doorway and let me leave.

He tilted his head back slowly, letting the golden barb slide to the edge of his throat. All the while, he stared into my eyes, savoring the panic.

*“Please, Daryl, I don’t…I don’t understand…”*

For a moment, he seemed to come to his senses. Pivoted his jaw forward, placing his hand palm up in front of his mouth like he was going to spit the damn thing out. At the same time, the wildness in his features waned. The grin melted down his face like candlewax, and his lips stopped quavering.

I saw the tiniest hint of fear behind his eyes, too.

*“It’s okay, it’s okay… just give me my phone back…I can call an ambulan-”*

Before I could finish my sentence, he winked, licking his lips playfully, cradling the needle in his creased tongue as he did. In an instant, Daryl’s mania returned at a fever pitch.

When I realized he had only been toying with me, pretending to hear reason, my heart sank. He flung his thick jowls towards the ceiling like he was throwing back a shot of whiskey, and the needle disappeared down his throat.

His mouth sputtered, coughing and choking violently as the needle tore into his esophagus, blood rising up and pooling in his cheeks. The emotion driving his expressions seemed to flicker, quickly swapping from hysteria to fear and then back again in the blink of an eye. I couldn’t help but imagine the sharp tip of the needle dragging down the inside of his throat like a rock climber digging their axe into the downward slope of a mountain, trying to slow the speed of their descent.

*“Now I’ll ask you again, Lenny, do you-”* his sentence was interrupted by a bout of coughing so vicious that it caused him to double over, creating slightly more space between his body and the door that he had been blocking.

I bolted, reaching for the knob. Right as I was about to grasp it, he snapped his hip back, sandwiching my wrist between his waist and the metal frame.

That changed when I called my mother from the station’s pay phone.

*“Lenny…”* she sobbed into the receiver.

*“I can’t believe you* ***made*** *him do that.”*

Numbly, I hung up, listening to her tiny static wails as I placed the phone back on the hook.

The judge considered me a flight risk and therefore refused to offer bail.

So, I remained there. Trapped in the county jail, indicted for Daryl’s murder, with the only evidence against me the unanimous belief that I ***made*** *him do it.*

\-------

The trial was a sham; an absolute fucking travesty of justice.

I watched in horror as the prosecution called friends and family to the stand, who all had the same thing to say. An unending parade of baseless insanity.

*“He* ***made*** *him do it. I just know it.”*

When it was the defense’s turn, my lawyer didn’t even bother to call me to the stand. He just ceded to the prosecution.

*“Even I know Lenny* ***made*** *him do it.”* he claimed.

The judge then denied my request for self-representation.

I’ll save you all the details of my attempts to fight back. It’s unnecessary, and will only rile me up. I think, at this point, it would be obvious what the response was.

After three days of that, the jury didn’t even leave the room to deliberate. They looked at each other, shook their heads in near unison, and delivered their verdict.

*“We find the defendant guilty.”*

Without a second thought, the judge handed down his sentencing.

*“Twenty years to life. May God have mercy on your soul.”*

The gavel banged against the wood, its sound reverberating around the room like church bells before a hanging, and the bailiff ushered me out the door.

\-------

That was two months ago. Since then, I’ve spent my days adjusting to the nuances of a maximum security prison, appealing my verdict, and attempting to figure out what the hell Daryl did to everyone.

So far, no luck on any front. Courts have universally denied my appeals. Prison has been a near impossible adjustment. I still don’t understand the mechanics of what my cousin has done to me, not one bit.

Then, there was what happened a few nights ago.

A loud tapping jolted me awake. The familiar sound of a baton rapping on the closed window at the top of my cell door continued as I rubbed sleep from my eyes.

One of the correction officers then pulled down the cover, revealing only his chin. He called my name, demanding I report to the door, despite the fact that it must have been two or three in the morning.

I dangled my feet off the top bunk, lowering myself carefully onto the floor below, hoping not to incur my cell mate’s wrath by waking him up. He was a light sleeper.

In my groggy state, I misjudged the distance to the floor, rattling the bunk beds as I fell. My cell mate didn’t wake up. Not to the tapping, not to me falling, not to the miniature earthquake that traveled through the metal bed frame as I attempted to soften my fall.

Something was off.

I pulled myself up and tiptoed towards the door. As I approached, I couldn’t see the particular CO that was standing outside. There was just a disembodied jaw smiling at me through the partition.

When he spoke again, it wasn’t with the same voice he had used to call me over.

*“You do understand now, don’t ya Lenny?”*

I’d recognize that terrible melody anywhere. It’s a tune that bounced against the inside of my skull like a pinball, day in and day out.

*“D-Daryl? …how…”* I stuttered.

*“One more chance, Lenny. Do you understand?”*

In an instant, my heart raced and my blood began to boil. Sweat poured down my face. A veritable supernova of anger was rushing to the surface; fury that I had suppressed while I pleaded my innocence, trying to appear harmless. When it bloomed, I had no hope of controlling it.

“***FUCK YOU, DARYL,”*** I screamed, battering my fists against the steel door until they bled. I couldn’t help myself. That sentence exploded out of my mouth, again and again, hoping my undead cousin on the other side of the threshold would suffocate on the steam my screams created, killing him a second time.

When he responded, I think he said something like:

*“Alright, Lenny. Let’s try this again.”*

But I can’t be one-hundred percent sure. I was lost in an endless maze of pain and confusion.

Whatever was on the other side of the door closed the window latch and walked away. As it clicked, my cell mate began to yowl, gripping his stomach with both hands and falling out of bed.

It took about a minute for the *real* prison guards to hear his agony. During that time, I was confined in a small concrete box with the shrieking man.

As I watched him curl up into the fetal position and roll around the floor, I found myself imagining something strange.

I looked around my cell, and I imagined that I was trapped inside Daryl’s black tin. If I squinted, I could even see the golden stars and spirals that had disappeared from the lid of the tin, littering the walls like an intricate mural or the incoherent scribbling of a madman.

My cell mate died that night. Ruptured ulcer in his stomach, acid exploding over his intestines like a water balloon.

Naturally, the prison decided it was my fault.

They told me I ***made*** it happen.

Looks like I’ll be sentenced to another twenty years, maybe more.

I’m posting this from the prison’s computer lab to see if anyone *outside* my immediate orbit is unaffected by whatever Daryl has done.

What’s happening to me?

How do I escape it?

Or the next time Daryl appears; do I just tell him that I understand?

Even though I don’t.

And, God, I don’t think I [ever will.](https://www.reddit.com/r/unalloyedsainttrina/)",8,1740623290.0,Odd_directions,1,1.0,False
1iz59h2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1iz59h2/tinder_date_turned_stalker/,Tinder date turned Stalker,"Okay, I have not shared this with anyone outside of my immediate family and husband. 

Growing up I was always a much chubbier girl, like weighing 240lbs in freshman year chubby. My senior year I thinned out a ton from an eating disorder and got down to 110lbs while being 5'9. I recovered from it and was able to maintain more healthy weights after. 

All of that being said, I did not date at all in high-school and to add my parents are divorced (have been since I was 3) so I had no examples of healthy relationships. 

When I was 21 I decided to make a tinder, in my brain I was like ""what's the harm?"" I matched with a few guys and talked with them but never got the nerve to meet up with any of them. I ended up deleting the app, but did not deactivate my account. 

I regularly used Facebook and noticed I had a message request. I opened it and saw it was from a guy who looked to be around my age inviting me over to come spend time with his family for a football game. I didn't think much of it and ignored the message. He messaged me again using Instagram and was just making general conversation with me to which I did engage in. 

One night when my close friend was over we were sitting and talking. She asked about if I had any luck with tinder and I told her I had not used it to much. I re-download the app to show her and saw that I had matched with the same guy who was contacting me via FB and Instagram. I messaged him back on there as well and he ended up asking me on a date. 

My friend was hyping me up to doing it so I agreed to meet him. He let me pick the place so I picked a small local coffee shop near my parents home. When I got there to meet him he was very nice, polite, pulled out chairs, everything. I insisted on paying for my own drink as my mom had always raised me to be more ""independent,"" and not feel like I owed anyone anything. He did get a drink as well, but not a coffee it was some energy drink. 

He was talking about his life, family, career and I talked about mine as well. He said he wanted to be open with me and that he did not want his wife in the future working as it was her job to stay home with the kids and raise them. This made me a tad uncomfortable, but everyone has their preferences and I like I stated before I didn't know what could/should look like a red flag. 

From there we talked frequently, I would go over to his apartment and cuddle with him and watch movies. It was at that time he gave me my first kiss (yes, I did not have my first kiss until my 20s, sorry if that's lame to some). I thought everything was going well/normal. I told him that was my first kiss and he did not believe me, but in the end he finally did and was kind of shocked by that as well as learning I was still a virgin/had not been with anyone. 

He asked me if I could take off work for a few days and travel with him to the next state over for a get away to which I declined (I mean, I've known him like a few weeks at this point and thought that was odd). He kept pressing but eventually gave up. 

The next day while I was at work he asked me to be his girlfriend and that he wanted to court me (he is LDS, which I had never heard of prior). He was explaining that when (not if) we got married I would need to also convert to that religion. I was raised nondenominational so I truly had no clue about it, but said I would look into it. 

After about a week of officially dating he said he was going to be visiting one of his female friends a few cities away and would be gone for a few days. I thought nothing of it, but my coworkers were saying that was a mega red flag. I tried talking with him about it after that saying I was uncomfortable with it, as it would just be her and him staying at her apartment. He told me I was insecure and broke up with me saying we could talk about it when he got back. 

He returned and invited me to his apartment for talking. However we didn't really have much to talk about, just kind of hung out. I asked him if we were still dating to which he said ""I mean, not officially."" So I asked him if it was okay to go on dates with other people to which he replied he did not care. 

I decided to go ahead and start back on tinder again (even though it kind of failed me prior) and matched with someone. Him and I hit it off immediately, we chatted about our past, traumas, etc. We talked for almost a month before even meeting up at our local mall for our first date. We walked around holding hands, went into one of the ""think-geek,"" stores where the worker saw my date wearing a starwars shirt and shoved a darthvader helmet on his head (my date was very red when they took off the helmet). We ate at yard house that was attached to the mall over all it was an amazing date and felt as natural as breathing. 

When I got home I looked at my phone to see I had 10 missed calls and about 20 messages from the previous guy I spoke to (Coffee house guy). The messages were pretty much stating he did not give me permission to date others and was asking why he saw me with someone else out and about. This was a bit alarming to me as 1)we were not dating anymore and 2)he did not know when my date was or where it was. I thought it was odd and blocked him thinking that would be it, it was not. 

The remainder transpired over a years span. He messaged my close friend (who he never met, but saw on one of my fb posts before) asking about me. He matched with her on tinder and asked about me. He got new numbers and tried calling/texting me. He showed up at my work (not while I was working thank God) asking for me. After a few months of this I told my at the time boyfriend (now husband) what was happening. He answered my phone threatening the guy, but that still did not stop him. He persisted in getting new numbers and calling me. 

Finally it stopped, months passed and I heard nothing from him and was very grateful. That was until I got a message on fb from him (from a new account) asking how I was and how I liked my new job (my job change was not public knowledge, nor on social media so unsure how he knew). He said he was married with a child now, but still thought about me often. I messaged him back stating that if I hear from him again I will be going to the police and filing a restraining order. Since then I have not heard from him. However the thought of what happened still doesn't feel real. 

I know this is super pointless to post, but wanted to share and see if anyone else had crazy dating experiences like that. ",9,1740623284.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,2,1.0,False
1iz594p,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1iz594p/you_wanna_know_why_im_doing_this_he_whispered/,"“You wanna know why I’m doing this?” He whispered, about to swallow another needle.","Daryl grinned, opened his mouth, and planted a second three-inch needle onto his tongue, rolling it around the surface like a cherry stem he was preparing to tie into a knot. Left to right, right to left. Right to left, left to right. I followed the needle, helplessly transfixed by the rhythm of the movement.

After a few seconds, he let the needle rest, now sticky and shimmering with saliva. I met his gaze, shaking my head *no*. Wordlessly, I pleaded with him. Begged him to move out of the doorway and let me leave.

He tilted his head back slowly, letting the golden barb slide to the edge of his throat. All the while, he stared into my eyes, savoring the panic.

*“Please, Daryl, I don’t…I don’t understand…”*

For a moment, he seemed to come to his senses. Pivoted his jaw forward, placing his hand palm up in front of his mouth like he was going to spit the damn thing out. At the same time, the wildness in his features waned. The grin melted down his face like candlewax, and his lips stopped quavering. 

I saw the tiniest hint of fear behind his eyes, too.

*“It’s okay, it’s okay… just give me my phone back…I can call an ambulan-”*

Before I could finish my sentence, he winked, licking his lips playfully, cradling the needle in his creased tongue as he did. In an instant, Daryl’s mania returned at a fever pitch.

When I realized he had only been toying with me, pretending to hear reason, my heart sank. He flung his thick jowls towards the ceiling like he was throwing back a shot of whiskey, and the needle disappeared down his throat.

His mouth sputtered, coughing and choking violently as the needle tore into his esophagus, blood rising up and pooling in his cheeks. The emotion driving his expressions seemed to flicker, quickly swapping from hysteria to fear and then back again in the blink of an eye. I couldn’t help but imagine the sharp tip of the needle dragging down the inside of his throat like a rock climber digging their axe into the downward slope of a mountain, trying to slow the speed of their descent.

*“Now I’ll ask you again, Lenny, do you-”* his sentence was interrupted by a bout of coughing so vicious that it caused him to double over, creating slightly more space between his body and the door that he had been blocking.

I bolted, reaching for the knob. Right as I was about to grasp it, he snapped his hip back, sandwiching my wrist between his waist and the metal frame.

A series of audible crunches filled the air, and agony detonated in my wrist like a pipe bomb.

I wailed and fell backwards on to the floor. The pain was unlike anything I’d experienced up to that point in my life; a vortex of fire and electricity churning in my forearm. Trying to stabilize the pulverized joint, I wrapped my other hand around the broken wrist, staring at it in disbelief.

Daryl stepped forward from the doorway. Looming over me, he bent down and gently put a meaty finger to my lips, shushing my howls. Reluctantly, my gaze lifted from my wrist to his eyes. When I finally quieted completely, he started anew.

*“You wanna know why I’m doing this, Lenny?”*

In his hand, he held out a black tin about the size of a matchbox, making a spectacle of showing me the details of the case like he was about to perform a magic trick. Golden stars and spirals covered the lid, forming a hypnotic pattern that straddled the line between purposeful and anarchic. He flicked the tin open with his thumb, revealing rows and rows of golden needles. They were thin, but that only made their ends appear sharper.

*“Please…Daryl…I don’t understand. Just stop. We can figure this out, please,”* I whimpered.

His pace accelerated.

Three more needles onto his tongue, swallowed, fingers back into the tin.

Five more needles onto his tongue, swallowed, blood and saliva oozing over his trembling lips.

On his last handful, Daryl didn’t even bother to lay them all in the same direction. Some were parallel to his tongue, others were horizontal; a bramble of tiny golden harpoons that fought back every step of the way as he attempted to force them down his throat.

He gulped, coughed, and wheezed, never looking away from me.

So, I finally gave in to his game. I asked him.

*“Why…why are you doing this?”*

Before he buckled over, blood spilling into the empty spaces in his abdomen from his stomach turned pin cushion, Daryl whispered the four words that have haunted me for the last half year.

Words that played on an endless loop in my mind, at the police station, in the courtroom; everywhere.

He wheezed and laughed, *“Because you* ***made*** *me.”*

\-------

Daryl and I were born on the same day, thousands of miles apart from each other. Cousins with very little in common.

But the coincidence of our births connected us.

Because it wasn’t *just* that we were born on the same day. We were born on the same day, in the same hour, with the same minute listed on both of birth certificates. It may have been the same second, too.

Of course, that’s impossible to prove.

Despite that bizarre synchronicity, our deliveries were quite different.

I was born full term, as planned, without a single complication. Thirty-eight weeks and a day of gestation, exactly as the doctor predicted. From what I’m told, my labor only lasted fifteen minutes. I was alive and breathing before the morphine could even be brought to the room to help my mother weather the contractions. Painless, punctual, and healthy.

Daryl was not blessed with my good fortune.

My cousin was born three months early, practically out of the blue and substantially underdeveloped. The doctors were baffled; my aunt had no risk factors for an extremely premature birth. Normally, there’s *some* identifiable reason for it, whether it be placental abnormalities, drug abuse or infection. But in his case, they couldn’t find a single thing.

He just…appeared. Exact same time as I did, down to the minute. Materialized from the pits of creation a whole season early so that we could cross that threshold together.

As you might imagine, babies born at twenty-six weeks of gestation don’t enter this world healthy.

He was physically underdeveloped for the demands of reality. Lungs don’t fully develop until at least *thirty-six* weeks, so he only existed for about a minute before a breathing tube needed to be placed down his throat. His blood vessels were exceptionally fragile, too. It was like blood was being transported through overcooked penne rather than strong, fibrous tubing. Because of that, he bled into his brain twelve hours after they put the breathing tube in.

I was born six pounds, two ounces. Daryl wasn’t even born with a pound to his name. Spent the first five months of his life in the neonatal intensive care unit, tethered to the location by the IVs and the feeding tubes like a dog leashed to a bike rack outside a bodega, waiting patiently for their owner to come back out with a pack of cigarettes so their life could continue.

Despite those hurdles, he lived. No long-term issues other than blindness in his left eye.

No biologic issues, at least.

The synchrony of our births became a family legend overnight. A story told over thanksgiving dinners, in grocery store parking lots, during the coffee break after Sunday Service. Over and over and over again until the flavor had been drained from the story; gum that had been chewed tasteless without being spat out. Because of that, no one treated us like cousins.

When Daryl and his family moved into my town, we were treated like twins, which introduced an element of competition between the two of us. An inevitable game of comparison perpetuated by our parents.

A game that I consistently won; not that I was looking to *beat* him at anything. I was just living my life.

My cousin never saw it that way, though.

\-------

As a kid, Daryl was quiet; reserved and a little socially awkward, but overall considered polite and well behaved.

That disposition was a mask that he put on for everyone but me. In mixed company, my cousin was a bashful titan. Despite his bumpy start in this life, he well surpassed my lanky frame before we were even toilet-trained.

But when we were alone, he dropped the act, and I got to see the strange hate that festered behind it all.

*“Why did you pull me out?”* he said, shoving an eight-year-old me to the floor of his bedroom.

I shrugged my shoulders and swiveled my head side to side, tears welling in my eyes.

*“I don’t…I don’t get what you mean,”* wiping the snot under my nose with the sleeve of my sweatshirt.

*“You know what I mean, Lenny. I was floating in the jelly, minding my own business. I wasn’t hurting you. I wasn’t hurting anyone. But you pulled me out. Reached inside what wasn’t yours and pulled me out. And now, I’m wrong. I feel wrong all the time. My heart beats backwards, not forwards. Part of my head is still in the jelly, and that hurts. The ink follows me. I can see it with my blind eye. Wakes me up at night.*

***Why did you do it?****”*

Every interaction I had with Daryl with no one else around was like this. Nonsense accusations paired with threats of physical violence. I dreaded the occasions where he’d be capable of getting me alone; holidays, birthdays, family reunions. They all inspired a burning, unspeakable worry that would smolder in my chest like a hot lump of coal.

Thankfully, as we aged, I gained agency over my life. If I didn’t want to be alone with Daryl, that was my choice. Once I was in High School, no one would just plop us in a room, close the door, and ask us to *play nice.*

Eventually, my unhinged cousin became a distant trauma, fading into the white noise of adult life. I moved out, went to college, then to law school. Got a good job. Paid for a nice condo with the money from that job.

From what my mom would tell me, Daryl still lived at home. Worked at a car wash. Still reserved, still quiet - still pleasant enough. Got in with the wrong crowd, though, apparently. Nothing to do with drugs, violence, or sex. It was something else. Despite being a notorious gossip, mom never gave me any details. All she ever told me was that it was really scaring my aunt.

After all that, she’d tell me how proud of me she was, and how she would brag to her friends about how much I made of myself.

She’d never *directly* say it, but mom only ever told me she was proud *after* expounding on how much of a fuck-up Daryl was. The implication was loud and clear; I was great, but I was *especially* great compared to my cousin, and that meant she was *better* than our aunt.

I hated my mom’s toxic pride. I pursued a career as a lawyer because I liked it, and it fulfilled me, but that didn’t make me any better than Daryl. Life is not a game of prestige. It felt fucked up to enjoy my position that much more on account of Daryl being seen as societally deficient, even if he tormented me as a child. I hoped that, whatever he was doing, however he was living his life, he was happy.

More than that, though, I hated the comparison because it linked me with him. I just wanted to be my own person, left alone.

When Daryl arrived on my doorstep with the tin of needles in his hand, I hadn’t seen or heard from him in over a decade.

\-------

Once he lost consciousness, I reached my uninjured hand into his jacket pocket to retrieve my phone.

*“9-1-1; what’s your emergency?”*

Minutes later, the EMTs rushed into my apartment and took over the resuscitation efforts, which was a tremendous relief. Between the shock, the terror, and the broken wrist, I’m sure my one-handed CPR was piss poor at best.

As I was stepping out the front door, escorted by one of the EMTs, I noticed something violently peculiar. Next to Daryl’s body, face now pale and blue from the blood loss, I spied the lid of the black tin lying next to his hand, but it looked different.

What I saw made no earthly sense. Initially, I attributed the discordance to a false memory, but I know now that what I noticed had significance, even if I still don’t understand exactly *what* that significance was as I type this.

The golden design that had been present on the tin only ten minutes prior was now gone. Vanished like it had never been there in the first place.

Hours later, discharged from the emergency room, wrist newly casted, I thought it was all over. I felt like I was free from him. He was dead, so the link was broken.

Finally, I'd be left alone.

I was sorely mistaken. Whatever Daryl had done, it continued despite his death.

Maybe even *because* of his death.

A sacrifice for a curse.

\-------

A day later, I opened my apartment door to find two detectives standing outside. They instructed me to follow them to their car. I needed to answer a few questions about my cousin’s death, and they requested I answered those questions at the police station.

Truthfully, though, it wasn’t a request. I was going to the station one way or the other. It was just a matter of how I was getting there and what shape I wanted to arrive in. I elected to avoid whatever force they had in mind if I refused and accompanied them to their idling sedan.

I wasn’t sure *what* they planned on asking me. Daryl arrived unannounced to my apartment, pulled my phone away from me before I could call 9-1-1, and then proceeded to ingest handfuls upon handfuls of sharp needles until he died from the internal bleeding. I didn’t know much more than that.

To my complete and absolute bewilderment, I was placed in an interrogation room when we arrived at the station.

I was the prime suspect in Daryl’s *murder*, and the detectives were looking for a confession.

*“Listen - we* *know* *you did this, Lenny.”* one detective shouted, slamming a hairy fist onto the metal table.

*“What the fuck are you talking about?? He swallowed the goddamned needles!”*

*“Yes! But…”* started the other detective.

*“You* ***made*** *him do it.”*

I leaned back in my chair, wide eyed, stunned into silence. These detectives were lunatics.

A second later, the hairy fisted detective parroted the statement. The same statement that Daryl had made right before he died.

*“Yes. You* ***made*** *him do it.”*

Initially, I wasn’t worried. Disturbed by the outlandish accusation, sure, but not worried. I went to law school. They had *zero* evidence, and I had no motive. None of it made a lick of sense. What was there to be concerned about?

That changed when I called my mother from the station’s pay phone.

*“Lenny…”* she sobbed into the receiver.

*“I can’t believe you* ***made*** *him do that.”*

Numbly, I hung up, listening to her tiny static wails as I placed the phone back on the hook.

The judge considered me a flight risk and therefore refused to offer bail.

So, I remained there. Trapped in the county jail, indicted for Daryl’s murder, with the only evidence against me the unanimous belief that I ***made*** *him do it.*

\-------

The trial was a sham; an absolute fucking travesty of justice.

I watched in horror as the prosecution called friends and family to the stand, who all had the same thing to say. An unending parade of baseless insanity.

*“He* ***made*** *him do it. I just know it.”*

When it was the defense’s turn, my lawyer didn’t even bother to call me to the stand. He just ceded to the prosecution.

*“Even I know Lenny* ***made*** *him do it.”* he claimed.

The judge then denied my request for self-representation.

I’ll save you all the details of my attempts to fight back. It’s unnecessary, and will only rile me up. I think, at this point, it would be obvious what the response was.

After three days of that, the jury didn’t even leave the room to deliberate. They looked at each other, shook their heads in near unison, and delivered their verdict.

*“We find the defendant guilty.”*

Without a second thought, the judge handed down his sentencing.

*“Twenty years to life. May God have mercy on your soul.”*

The gavel banged against the wood, its sound reverberating around the room like church bells before a hanging, and the bailiff ushered me out the door.

\-------

That was two months ago. Since then, I’ve spent my days adjusting to the nuances of a maximum security prison, appealing my verdict, and attempting to figure out what the hell Daryl did to everyone.

So far, no luck on any front. Courts have universally denied my appeals. Prison has been a near impossible adjustment. I still don’t understand the mechanics of what my cousin has done to me, not one bit.

Then, there was what happened a few nights ago.

A loud tapping jolted me awake. The familiar sound of a baton rapping on the closed window at the top of my cell door continued as I rubbed sleep from my eyes.

One of the correction officers then pulled down the cover, revealing only his chin. He called my name, demanding I report to the door, despite the fact that it must have been two or three in the morning.

I dangled my feet off the top bunk, lowering myself carefully onto the floor below, hoping not to incur my cell mate’s wrath by waking him up. He was a light sleeper.

In my groggy state, I misjudged the distance to the floor, rattling the bunk beds as I fell. My cell mate didn’t wake up. Not to the tapping, not to me falling, not to the miniature earthquake that traveled through the metal bed frame as I attempted to soften my fall.

Something was off.

I pulled myself up and tiptoed towards the door. As I approached, I couldn’t see the particular CO that was standing outside. There was just a disembodied jaw smiling at me through the partition.

When he spoke again, it wasn’t with the same voice he had used to call me over.

*“You do understand now, don’t ya Lenny?”*

I’d recognize that terrible melody anywhere. It’s a tune that bounced against the inside of my skull like a pinball, day in and day out.

*“D-Daryl? …how…”* I stuttered.

*“One more chance, Lenny. Do you understand?”*

In an instant, my heart raced and my blood began to boil. Sweat poured down my face. A veritable supernova of anger was rushing to the surface; fury that I had suppressed while I pleaded my innocence, trying to appear harmless. When it bloomed, I had no hope of controlling it.

“***FUCK YOU, DARYL,”*** I screamed, battering my fists against the steel door until they bled. I couldn’t help myself. That sentence exploded out of my mouth, again and again, hoping my undead cousin on the other side of the threshold would suffocate on the steam my screams created, killing him a second time.

When he responded, I think he said something like:

*“Alright, Lenny. Let’s try this again.”*

But I can’t be one-hundred percent sure. I was lost in an endless maze of pain and confusion.

Whatever was on the other side of the door closed the window latch and walked away. As it clicked, my cell mate began to yowl, gripping his stomach with both hands and falling out of bed.

It took about a minute for the *real* prison guards to hear his agony. During that time, I was confined in a small concrete box with the shrieking man.

As I watched him curl up into the fetal position and roll around the floor, I found myself imagining something strange.

I looked around my cell, and I imagined that I was trapped inside Daryl’s black tin. If I squinted, I could even see the golden stars and spirals that had disappeared from the lid of the tin, littering the walls like an intricate mural or the incoherent scribbling of a madman.

My cell mate died that night. Ruptured ulcer in his stomach, acid exploding over his intestines like a water balloon.

Naturally, the prison decided it was my fault.

Looks like I’ll be sentenced to another twenty years, maybe more.

I’m posting this from the prison’s computer lab to see if anyone *outside* my immediate orbit is unaffected by whatever Daryl has done.

What’s happening to me?

How do I escape it?

The narrator is having a dream about the house manderley at night, with a full moon. it wasn't the first time she was there, nor the first dream about the mansion. she was in the iron gates, and like a ghost she passed through the gates. The mansion was covered with flowers and trees. the narrator felt the excitement, she saw the silently and quiet sea. once she lived there with her husband maxim, but now they would never live again happily.

She was woken up by the harsh sunlight, in  a hotel room. she and maxim would never talk about manderley, she would never tell her dreams. Manderley had been destroyed by evil and hatred… they would never come back. Sometimes it was bored in their quiet hotel, that their memories of the house were brought back. they shall never see the English sun again. they lost a lot, but they grew as a person.



***CHAPTER 1***

The narrator was traveling with Mrs van Hopper, a rich woman. van hopper loved to meet rich and famous people and every summer she stayed at the most expensive hotel in monte carlo, she knew who well-known people were there so she could speak to them.

The narrator hated van hopper, but at least paid her well and it was just her companion. They went to the hotel’s restaurant. van hopper had her high heeled shoes  and her heavy body swayed above her short legs. The narrator was young and shy, she was straight-haired and badly fitting clothes. Once at their table, van hopper complained that there wasn't any well known person, she was greedy. She ordered a large lunch for herself and then ate in silence. The narrador felt awkward about how the van hopper ate so she looked away. The narrator saw a new guest sitting at the next table… a van hopper put down her fork and her eyes reflected excitement. It was max de winter, he owned the house manderly, a beautiful old house in the west of england. his wife had died a year ago. 

van hopper finished her meal as fast as she could, van hopper would drink her coffee in the lounge  that was between the restaurant and the main door of the hotel. van hopper asked her companion to bring her a letter from her nephew who had met Max de winter. She went upstairs and when she came back van hopper was in the lounge and Max de Winter alongside. He was a handsome maa, pale-faced and dark-haired. He stood politely. She gave Van Hopper the letter. Max welcomed them as his guests. He was sitting in a chair, she was next to the van hopper. They talked about how van hopper met Max at his nephew’s party. Max de Winter remembered her. They kept talking until van hopper’s dressmaker was waiting at her room. Van hopper offered Max a few drinks the next day, but he would be absent all day. 

Max de Winter was an attractive but strange man, he looked rushed. van hopper told her how rude she was with him. in the room, she sat at the window seat looking outside. She wasn't allowed to go out because some friends of van hopper would come for tea, they all were rude women. Her job was to talk to them, light their cigars and tidy the room after they were gone. 

a waiter knocked the door with a note for her, the letter was from max de winter, he apologized for how rude he was earlier. the waiter left and van hopper called her, she couldn't stop thinking about manderley.

  
  


***CHAPTER 2***

The next day, van hopper woke up with a high fever. Her doctor came…she had the flu. Van hopper had to be in bed to get better. She needed a nurse to look after her. 

Monte Carlo was boring. Once the nurse came, she went to the restaurant. She felt great being alone, the room was almost empty and there was max de winter. she tried not to look in his direction, she picked up the menu but she knocked down the flowers on her table. The water was all over the table and her skirt. de winter saw that and called a waiter to lay another place on his table. she didnt want but de winter was going to ask her anyway.

They ordered the food and talked about van hopper and what she was doing with her and he asked more about herself. her father died suddenly and a few weeks after her mother died. They talked for over an hour. He talked about how they were alike, alone in the world. The narrator was going to do some sketching at some old houses but Max told her he would take her. 

They soon reached the place she wanted to sketch but it was so windy that they had to go back to the car, then he drove on, up the steep mountain road. He stooped at the very edge of the ended road. Max de Winter looked uncomfortable, he was in that place before. He turned on the car and went again at the twisting road. Max started talking about Maderley, about the gardens and flowers; the sea that was near the house; a secret valley hidden from the world with scent flowers.

Once back in Monte Carlo, she saw a book and overread it, Max told her she could keep it. The narrator walked up the steps of the hotel feeling like a child after the party. She sat in the lounge, she ordered tea and sandwiches.she was daydreaming about her time with Max, she took the book and looked carefully. On the front page Max dedicated the book to Rebecca, her ex wife who drowned in the sea near manderley. She stood up and walked unhappily back to her room with a van hopper.



***CHAPTER 3***

For the next ten days van hopper was still in bed, and the narrator was going out every morning with Max de Winter in his car and  lunch with him. she’d forgotten the place they went but it didn't matter. she wanted to keep those moments and never forget it… she question himself with he was going with a women like her, he knew everything about her, but she dont know nothing about him except he lived at Manderley and his wife was dead.. a silent went off, max turned and said his memories were very unhappy, we’d like t forget them. Something happened to him a year ago that changed his life, that’s why he was in monte carlo, but since they hung out Max enjoyed her company. 

the narrator was at the edge of tears, max turned on the car to go back. Max noticed her tears. Max took her hand and kissed her and gave her his handkerchief to wipe the tears. He was older than her… he didn't know how to speak to her, he wanted to start again, his family called him maxim. The morning was bright again, she was happy and comfortable with him.

back with van hopper they were playing cards, van hopper wanted to know if max was still in the hotel. The van hopper didn't know they were hanging in and out of the hotel. van hopper said that de winter was attractive and that people would say that his wife was clever and beautifully dressed, everyone adored her. The narrator couldn't forget about Rebecca's books in her room, Rebecca was everything she would not.  



***CHAPTER 4***

Two days later van hopper received a letter from his daughter saying that she was sailing from new york on saturday and her child was ill, so van hopper decided to go to new york, monte carlo was getting bored for her, and they already had all the trucks and bags packed. The narrator felt sad, she didn't want to be away from Maxim but van hopper didn't care. She went to the bathroom, so she could have a moment alone but a van hopper knocked on the door. She had to hurry because there was too much to do. She spent the day arranging the journey and packing, and van hopper came to say goodbye. Maxim wasn't in the hotel, and she cried all night.

The next morning she was red for crying, van hopper had bad-temperedly, they would take the earlier train, van hopper told her to go to the reception. The narrator had another idea: she went upstairs instead to the Maxim room. Maxim was in his room, having breakfast, he seemed surprised. the narrator told him about her leaving monte carlo, she didn't have any other option she worked for her. Maxim gave her two choices; marry him and go to Manderley or stay with van hopper.

She thought he was joking around, but he was so serious. She thought they belonged in two different worlds. Maxim would take her to Venice on their honeymoon, traveled to Italy and then to Mandeley. She loved the idea of living there. Maxim would tell van hopper about the marriage thing. He and van hopper had a private conversation. While she waited the narrator took the book of poems and cut the page which had Rebecca's name of Rebecca and then burned it. Max walked out, everything was fine, he went downstairs and she went in to talk to van hopper.

Van hopper was by the window smoking, she talked about how clever she was but he was older than her and she could handle Manderley even though she thought she’d do it fine. Van hopper put the cigarette down, and spilled the truth, man was alone there, he couldn't handle loneliness and desolation, she thought she was marrying her to fill the gap Rebecca left.

  
  
  


***CHAPTER 5***

they arrived at manderley early may, before summer. When they reached Manderley the gloomy, raining gloomy sky of London turned into a blue sky. The narrator felt anxious and lonely going to a new house, while Max was like coming back from a trip. the house in a valley beyond the trees, they turned to a corner there was a cross road and then a high wall. The road turned again where two high iron gates and beside a lodge, people looked at them out of the windows of the lodge. Max told her that she needed to be herself and that mts Danver, the housekeeper, would leave everything to her.

They drove along the drive that led up the house , the drive turned and twisted like a snake, there were tall trees where a little sunlight could be seen. Then the trees were gone and the sun shone. they turned into the last corner and there lay Manderley.

a perfect old house, built in a small hollow and gray stones that glowed, smooth lawn surrounded the house and beyond the lawn were the gardens, and beyond the garden was the beautiful sea. They stopped in front of stone steps where the top was the door with all the personnel looking at them. an old man named Frith received them.

they went up the stone steps where two lines of servants were, mrs danvers was a tall, thin woman she looked dead and she looked creepy. 

Maxim took her to the library for tea, and a dog named Jasper, ran to the library doing a friendly welcome. The library was spacious and comfortable, also the long windows made a beautiful view to the lawn and beyond that, the sea. They had tea while Maxim read the letters un-opened when Frait asked if they’d wanted to see their room in the east wing, the narrator went alone, Maxin would go later.

Mrs Danvers was waiting for her and led her into a small room that led into a large light bedroom, with wide windows where the views were the rose gardens. That room was especially arranged for her. She and Mrs Danvers talked about how she worked at Manderley for years and all that she saw, until Maxim arrived he talked how he loved the quietness and peace of the room. Then he showed her the rest of manderley.

Once back at the library, Maxim was reading the paper, and she poured a cup of coffee and stroked Jasper's ears, then she realized that was the same thing Rebecca did when she lived.



***CHAPTER 6***

all the same things happened every day at manderley, like it was rehearsal. The first morning Maxim had almost finished his breakfast, she served herself. Maxim's sister Beatrice was going to come over for lunch with her husband. The narration felt sad because Maxim had many things to do and they were not to spend their morning together. she finished the breakfast and went to the library, the fireplace wasn't lit, so she went to the dinning room to find matches then Frith came into the room. he talked that usually the fireplace wasn't lit until afternoon, and mrs de winter used the morning room before lunch and how mrs de winter wrote her letters in the morning room before breakfast. The narrator would go to the morning room, but she didn't know where it was, Frith told her the way. 

The morning room was small and different from the library, it looked perfectly decorated with everything in a specific place to be. An old writing desk stood near the window with everything labeled in order, in one of the drawers was a book that belonged to Rebecca, that desk was hers. Then the telephone rang, it was Mrs Danvers asking if she had seen the menu. she put down the telephone, she thought how rebecca would had responded to the call, the she picked a piece of paper and start to write a letter to van hopper, and saw how childish was her handwriting comparing from rebecca’s 



***CHAPTER 7***

Maxim’s sister had arrived early, but he wasnt at home and the narrator didn't want to meet them by herself, so she ran upstairs looking for her bedroom but she got lost. She went up a dark staircase to a corridor with doors on each side, she walked on and came to a wide window where below was a green lawn and the bright green sea. It was loud because of the sea. Mrs Danvers appeared and told her was in the west wing. She turned back and walked but Mrs Danvers was following her.

The narrator arrived in the morning room, Maxim was there with her sister Beatrice, her husband Giles, and Maxim agent Frank crawley. Beatrice was tall, broad shouldered and looked almost like maxim. Beatrice welcomed her. Giles was big and Frank was a thin man and worried-faced. Frank worked for the mandeley house. Everyone was laughing. Beatrice and the narrator talked, if it was to swim in the bay which made all the room go quiet, Beatrice was worried for Maxim about what had happened to Rebecca but the thing was that the narrator didn't know the full story, Maxim hadn't told her anything.

They had lunch and once over she took Beatrice out on the terrace, and talked about how she met Maxim , how she got with Mrs Danvers, Mrs Danvers was very jealous, and she adored rebecca. The men came out and a servant brought rugs and chairs. They sat under a tree. At that moment she wanted to be alone with Maxim, she was sitting leaning against Maxim's chair. That afternoon was quiet and peaceful, which is what the narrator wanted for her life with maxim. Then Beatrice and her husband had to leave. Back to the drive, Beatrice apologized for all the questions and that she was very different from Rebecca, then they drove away.

***CHAPTER 8***

After a moment, Maxim felt relieved that her sister was gone, but he looked angry.  He wanted to go for a walk even though it was raining. Robert fetched a coat for the narrator and they took Japer with them. He was barking with happiness. They talked of how Beatrice is kind-hearted but sometimes said the wrong things. 

They went through a dark wood when they came to a clearing in the wood where two paths appeared, going in opposite directions. Jasper ran through the right path. Maxim called him and he stopped, that path took them into a small bay, instead they took the left path. 

The left path led them into a valley which on each side of the narrow path stood bushes with pink, white and gold flowers. every seemed beautiful, and the soft summer rain fell and the air was full of scents maxim called it ‘The happy valley’

He picked up a flower and gave it to her. She was happy to see the beauty of manderley, and heard the bird sing while holding Maxim's hand.



***CHAPTER 9***

They left behind the valley to come into a little narrow bay, and almost at their feets it was the sea. They threw stones into the sea. She and Maxim were laughing and very happy. Then they noticed Jasper had disappeared, they tried to call him but he didn't appear until the narrator heard a sharp bark coming beyond a line of rocks to the right of the beach. She began to climb the wet rocks but Maxim didn't want her to climb the rocks.

she reached the top of the rock, and she saw another bay, a small stone wall across the bay made it into a small harbor, down to the shore near the woods layed a small cottage building made out of stone and a man was near the shore, dresses as a fisherman, jasper was down there barking at the fisherman and running round and round. The narrator tried to call him, but Jasper ignored her, she looked back and Max wasn't there. 

The narrator decided to climb down the bay. She was near the strange man. He had small eyes, round-faces and thick red lips. She called Jasper back and the man talked, saying that the dog belonged to the house. She tried to be kind but the man stayed still looking at her. The narrator went to the cottage to find a string to tie jasper, the outside did not look very neat, and once inside it was furnished with shelves with books, although it had  thick dust. At the end of the room she opened a door that led into a small boat house. she found a string and cut it, the place felt out of place, and frighteningly, she walked out. The man was still watching her and asked if she would come back, the eyes of the man. she walked back to the rock where maxim was waiting for her, he looked angry. Maxim told her that that man was Ben, he was mad. They walked past the cottage through a path in the woods, it was steep and dark.

They had a discussion about how it was her fault for walking so fast and that she didn't need to go after jasper. Maxim didn't dare to go into that place beyond the rock or that cottage, it brought him back bad memories, his face was white, he regretted leaving italy.

They arrived at manderley and had tea at the library, the narrator tried to put back her tears. He wasn't angry at her but his eyes said something else, until the servants put the table, maxim colors came back, he was smiling again. while they were eating she took the handkerchief in her raincoat that didn't belong to her, but the letter R could be seen, it was Rebecca's handkerchief and raincoat. and The scent of the handkerchief was the same scent of the happy valley. She couldn't escape from rebecca. 

  


***CHAPTER 10***

A week later, the weather was wet and cold, and the narrator could see the sea from the terrace. The sea was loud but they didn't bother her. she was being disturbed for the recent event down the bay, she faulted herself for bringing back maxim bad memories. 

visitors would come to manderley and she knew that the Rebecca theme would bring in the table. One afternoon she was having tea when the wife of the bishop called. She asked if Maxim would hold the manderley fancy dress ball, which she didn't know that man did, but the narrator would ask Maxim about it. Then the narrator brought the conversation to Rebeca, she was a lonely person… so full of life and well loved by everyone, something the narrator thought would never be. She sat in the library thinking about the lively Rebecca but that didn't matter anymore, she was Mrs de winter. 

Later that afternoon, Frank Crawley arrived. The narrator asked about the ball. It was held every year and people came from miles around, and she told him she found the cottage in the bay, that cottage belonged to Rebecca where she slept and had moonlight picnics on the shore. She asked about the buoy in the boat and why there wasn't a boat; Rebecca was in the boat when she drowned, nobody had seen the accident there wasn't a way to help her. She apologized for all the questions. Frank told her to forget the past, but the narrator asked if Rebecca was very beautiful as a last question, and Frank replied that she was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen.



***CHAPTER 11***

Every morning Mrs Davener gave her the menus and rang her from the house telephone, the narrator hadn't seen her after, the narrator had a new maid called clarice, she was new. The narrator tried to follow what Frank had told her, but she noticed something that made her think of rebecca. 

One day the narrator was in the morning room. Beatrice had sent her a wedding gift as she promised. She sent four big books about painting. She was glad to have something that belonged to her. She put them in a row on top of the desk but it was so heavy that it fell and knocked down a china ornament. It was a little cupid. she felt frightened, she found an envelope and put the pieces in it and hid in the desk, put the books in the library and left. 

The following day she was with Maxim in the library, and Frith came and called maxim. Mrs Danvers accused Robert of stealing or breaking the little cupid. The narrator decided to confront it and said that she had broken it. Mrs Danvers came into the room and Maxim told her that it was a mistake, the narrator felt like a child. The narrator said where she had hidden the piece, when Mrs Danvers had gone she apologized for being so careless. but Maxim felt like she acted strangely sometimes and that she should hide her shyness. Then Maxim threw his paper and his face got angry and dark because she thought he had married her because she was quiet and dull, so that people wouldn't gossip. After talking about if it was the right decision to marry and their age difference, they calm down and kiss. the narrator asked for the cupid… the cupid was a wedding gift for Rebecca, then Maxim sat down in his chair. 



***CHAPTER 12***

Maxim had gone to London at the end of June, the first time the narrator was alone at Manderley, it was quite there. She took Jasper to walk into the woods, they walked through the happy valley to the sea and Maxim wasn't there, so they could walk to the other bay.

She walked across the beach until arrived at the cottage that did not look creepy at all. jasper ran into the boat house and ben was sitting by the wall. he looked like he was shaking with fear and tear were rolling down his face. he said that she didn't looked like the other woman that had told him he would be locked up. he smile because the narrator wouldnt locked down, ben walked down the beach and she up towards the woods. she was feeling watched.

Once on the lawn of the house, she felt relieved, and a car was parked. It looked like there were visitors. The narrator looked up at the west wing and in one of the rooms a man stood in the window then another figure, maybe Mrs Danvers, closed the shutter. she walked into the morning room that smelt like smoke, she heard people coming and hid behind the door. an old man’s voice was talking to jasper and then he saw her behind the door. It was a big, handsome man but his face was red and blue-eyed. A moment later Mrs Danvers came into the room and introduced the man called Mr. Favell, he spoke like an arrogant man. In the hall he and the narrator talked, he didn't want her to tell Maxim about his visit, it looked like they didn't like each other. Then she got into his car and left. The narrator was confused why he was there, and where Mrs Danvers had gone, she decided to go up to the east wing and see if everything was all right.

In the corridor I found the first door and went in , turned on the lights and the room was completely furnished. It looked dustless and tidied… it was rebecca’s bedroom, there were flowers in the dressing table and beside the bed, and a pair of slippers under a chair, the room seemed to not be used in a long time, that room was the one that man and mrs danvers were. She held the slippers under the chair, and held Rebecca's nightdress in the bed, it smelt like a happy valley. 

Then, Mrs Danvers came in, her face looked strange and excited. Mrs Danvers showed her the room and talked about how lovely it was. the night before rebecca died she was wearing the nightdress, it looked that mrs danvers was fascinated by the things rebecca had. Mrs Danvers was out the evening she had died, and did not look after her after five when the boat wasn't there anymore. the sea could be heard from there. Danvers sometimes felt Rebecca around like the narrator did . After a moment of being quiet the narrator went back to the corridor and went to her room to rest, she felt sick.

Started feeling very bloated and gassy was burping a lot then started getting sweaty and chills with nausea. Was at a nail salon trying to hold it in started throwing up when I left on the side of the road walking back to my hotel but felt like that wasn’t enough to relieve me. Back at the hotel extreme violent D that has been non stop plus low fever and body aches. Only had some sprite that night since no ginger ale here. This was 2 days ago, couldn’t sleep that night and flew to Chiang Mai yesterday. Have only eaten 2 bananas and one piece of toast and electrolyte water. The smell of food even coffee makes me nauseous. I am running to the toilet last night every 30 seconds it was hard to sleep. 

My prescription anti nausea medication from home and over the country diarrhea medicine is not subsidizing symptoms. Fever was short and no more swears/chills but body still achy.

My stomach has never hurt so much like this before and the issue is even drinking water makes me need to go to the bathroom more.

Where should I go for help? I do have travel insurance. I was thinking at this point if the OTC meds aren’t curbing symptoms maybe I need something stronger?",4,1740623063.0,ThailandTourism,21,0.75,False

Look, either you support liberal democracy and freedom and the rule of law, or you don’t…and Trump supports none of that. Bezos is obviously ingratiating himself with Trump (as Sam Stein correctly noted) and transparently skewing the editorial pages of WaPo in a MAGA-friendly direction. David Shipley is not Noam Chomsky, so him leaving means Bezos is up to some bullshit.

1iz54ut,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1iz54ut/plastique/,Plastique,">**(Some wear names like gold. Others borrow them. Tonight, a woman walks with purpose—chased by something she can’t escape. By morning, she’ll remember why.)**

>

The night smelled of rain and asphalt.

Addison Monroe stepped onto the street, heels tapping in quick, measured clicks. The city pulsed around her—horns, chatter, the distant bass of a nightclub. She adjusted the silk scarf around her neck, its designer logo catching in the neon glow.

**She was a woman in control. She was someone.**

She turned the corner, and then—**she saw it.**

A figure. **Wrapped in black plastic.** Standing motionless beneath a flickering streetlamp.

A vagrant, surely. But something about the way it **stood**—rigid, waiting—sent a shiver up her spine.

She kept walking. Faster.

The rain started. Light at first. Then heavier. The damp air curled against her skin, making her shudder. She pulled her coat tighter and **didn’t look back.**

But she didn’t need to.

She **felt it.**

**It was following her.**

A glance over her shoulder—nothing. The street was empty.

Still, unease slithered under her skin.

She turned into a more crowded area, near the late-night cafés. The glow of warm lights, the murmur of voices—it should have made her feel safe. **It didn’t.**

She stole another look back—**the plastic figure stood at the edge of the street, barely visible in the rain.**

Her breath hitched. She stepped into a small diner, heart hammering. The bell above the door jingled, and the waitress looked up from behind the counter.

*""Need a table?""*

Addison shook her head. *""No, I—""* She stopped.

Through the window, across the street, **it was standing there.**

Not moving. Not even turning its head. **Just… waiting.**

Addison’s hands clenched. This was ridiculous. A bum trying to freak her out? She wasn’t some scared little girl. She was Addison Monroe.

With forced calm, she turned back to the waitress. *""Actually, I’ll take a coffee.""*

She sat near the window, eyes locked on the figure. The rain made it blurry, the streetlights warping its edges.

The coffee arrived. Hot. Bitter. She took a sip. Her hands wouldn’t stop shaking.

When she looked up—**it was gone.**

She exhaled a laugh. A nervous, shaky thing. See? Nothing. Just her mind playing tricks.

She paid in cash and stepped outside.

The street was slick with rain.

**Empty.**

She started walking home. The city was quieter now, the late-night crowds thinning. Her building was only five blocks away.

Four blocks.

Three.

She glanced back.

**A shadow moved.**

Addison’s stomach dropped.

She turned a corner. Picked up her pace.

Another corner. A sidestreet.

Footsteps.

Her pulse slammed in her throat.

**It was real. Someone was following her.**

She turned her head slightly, just enough to see—**a figure. Moving faster now. A little too fast.**

Not running. **But closing the distance.**

Her heels clicked against the pavement. She swallowed her fear and **forced herself not to sprint.** Running meant panic. Running meant weakness.

Two blocks.

She cut through a parking lot. A shortcut.

Bad idea.

Halfway through, she realized how quiet it was. How isolated.

The footsteps behind her **stopped.**

She turned—**nothing.**

No one there.

Just the rain. The endless dark.

She let out a shuddering breath. *I’m losing my mind.*

She turned back toward the street—

**A figure stepped out from behind a parked car.**

Closer now. **Much closer.**

Her breath hitched. She stumbled backward, heart racing.

**It was wrapped in black plastic.**

Not a coat. Not fabric. **Plastic. Tight. Binding. Rustling.**

Addison turned and ran.

Her heels skidded on wet pavement. She didn’t care. She ran.

A sharp turn—down a main street, past glowing storefronts. Her breath came in ragged gasps, but she didn’t stop.

A cab. Parked ahead.

She sprinted to the door, yanked the handle—**locked.**

She banged on the window. *""Please! Let me in!""*

The driver didn’t even look at her. Just muttered, *""Find another ride.""*

Addison turned—

**The figure was there.**

**Ten feet away.**

She froze. The rain soaked through her coat. **The plastic rustled in the wind.**

Her throat closed.

She took a step back. Another.

And then—**it moved.**

Not rushed. Not lunging. Just **walking straight toward her.**

Addison ran.

Through alleys, past shuttered shops. Her lungs burned. **It didn’t stop.**

It never stopped.

She reached her building, swiping her keycard—**it slipped from her shaking hands.**

She grabbed it. Shoved it against the reader—**beep.**

The door unlocked. She stumbled inside, slamming it shut behind her.

Silence.

She gasped for air, pressing against the door. Her fingers trembled as she checked the locks.

Nothing. No one was there.

A nervous laugh bubbled up. **It was gone.**

She turned to the lobby mirror, wiping rain from her face—

And **screamed.**

The reflection staring back **was not Addison Monroe.**

The designer coat? **Rags. Layers of grime.**

The heels? **Worn-down sneakers.**

The shopping bags? **Crushed, greasy plastic.**

She touched her face. **Sunken cheeks. Hollow eyes.**

The truth hit her like a sledgehammer. **She was never Addison Monroe.**

She was the beggar. The woman in plastic.

A choked sob tore from her throat.

Across the glass, **the real Addison Monroe** stepped out of a sleek car.

She glanced toward the door, eyes narrowing in disgust.

*""You again?""*

Addison turned.

No.

Not *Addison.*

Not *Brittany.*

**Someone else.**

Her lips curled into a thin, eerie smile.

And she stepped into the night.

1iz5104,https://www.reddit.com/r/online_sellers/comments/1iz5104/10_etsy_seo_mistakes_that_are_costing_you_sales/,10 Etsy SEO Mistakes That Are Costing You Sales (And How to Fix Them),"
Etsy is a fantastic platform for selling handmade and unique products, but if your listings aren’t optimized, they might never reach the right buyers. Many sellers struggle with SEO (Search Engine Optimization), which directly impacts how often their products show up in search results.  

Here are **10 common Etsy SEO mistakes** and how to fix them!  

---

## **1. Using Titles That Are Too Short or Vague**  
### 🚫 Mistake:  
A title like ""Cute Mug"" or ""Handmade Necklace"" is too broad and won’t rank well in search results.  

### ✅ How to Fix:  
Use long-tail keywords that describe the item clearly.  
**Example:** Instead of ""Cute Mug,"" try **""Personalized Coffee Mug with Name - Custom Gift for Coffee Lovers.""**  

---

## **2. Not Researching Keywords**  
### 🚫 Mistake:  
Guessing keywords instead of using research tools means missing out on high-traffic search terms.  

### ✅ How to Fix:  
Use tools like **Etsy’s search bar (autocomplete), EverBee, eRank, or Marmalead** to find what people are actually searching for.  

---

## **3. Not Using All 13 Tags**  
### 🚫 Mistake:  
Leaving some of Etsy’s 13 tag slots empty means missing out on potential traffic.  

### ✅ How to Fix:  
Use all 13 tags with a mix of broad and specific terms.  
**Example:** For a wooden ring, your tags could include:  
`wooden ring, handmade ring, nature jewelry, eco-friendly ring, rustic wedding band, minimalist jewelry, boho jewelry`  

---

## **4. Ignoring Seasonal Keywords**  
### 🚫 Mistake:  
Keeping the same keywords year-round without adjusting for seasonal trends.  

### ✅ How to Fix:  
Update listings for seasonal searches like **""Mother’s Day gift"" in March-April** or **""Christmas stocking stuffer"" in October-December.**  

---

## **5. Keyword Stuffing in Titles**  
### 🚫 Mistake:  
Cramming too many keywords in a title makes it hard to read.  
Example: **""Handmade Mug Coffee Mug Cute Mug Pottery Mug Gift Mug""**  

### ✅ How to Fix:  
Keep it natural and readable.  
Example: **""Handmade Ceramic Coffee Mug - Unique Pottery Cup - Gift for Coffee Lovers""**  

---

## **6. Writing Weak Product Descriptions**  
### 🚫 Mistake:  
Only writing one or two sentences, or skipping important details.  

### ✅ How to Fix:  
- Describe the size, material, color, and any customization options.  
- Answer common buyer questions in the description.  
- Naturally include some keywords (but don’t overdo it).  

**Example:**  
*""This handcrafted ceramic mug holds 12oz and features a rustic glaze finish. It’s perfect for coffee, tea, or hot chocolate. Each piece is unique due to the handmade process.""*  

---

## **7. Using Only One or Two Photos**  
### 🚫 Mistake:  
Listings with fewer photos get fewer sales because buyers want to see details.  

### ✅ How to Fix:  
Use at least **8-10 high-quality images**, including:  
- Different angles  
- Close-ups of details  
- Size reference (next to a ruler or hand)  
- Packaging (how it looks when shipped)  
- Lifestyle shot (the product in use)  

---

## **8. Not Renewing Listings at the Right Time**  
### 🚫 Mistake:  
Etsy gives a slight boost to newly renewed listings, but renewing at random times won’t help.  

### ✅ How to Fix:  
Renew listings when your target audience is active.  
- **Weekends and evenings** tend to be peak shopping times.  
- Use Etsy Stats to see when you get the most traffic.  

---

## **9. Ignoring the Importance of Reviews**  
### 🚫 Mistake:  
Not encouraging buyers to leave reviews means fewer trust signals for new customers.  

### ✅ How to Fix:  
- Send a friendly post-purchase message thanking them and reminding them to leave a review.  
- Deliver great packaging and fast shipping for a better customer experience.  

---

## **10. Forgetting About Off-Etsy Traffic**  
### 🚫 Mistake:  
Relying only on Etsy search when other platforms can drive extra traffic.  

### ✅ How to Fix:  
- Share listings on **Instagram, Pinterest, and Facebook** to attract more buyers.  
- Use **Pinterest** for long-term traffic (pins last much longer than social media posts).  

---

## **Final Thoughts**
