1gonav2,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1gonav2/what_are_the_easiest_hacks_lifestyles_changes_to/,What are the easiest hacks/ lifestyles changes to lose weight? ,"I'll be straight to the point, I am *lazy*. I hate the gym, the most i'll do is go for a walk and lift some light weights at home and do squats. I want to know basically the laziest method of changes that one can make to lose extra weight. I'm not over weight by **any means**, but it's almost my birthday and i'd like to lose a few pounds because why not. 

For reference, I usually eat three meals a day. Sometimes my hunger is less or more depending on the day, so my calories range from 1200 or upwards of 1600. 

What do I usually eat/drink? 
- Eggs
- Greek Yogurt 
- Avocados 
- Sprouted Bread
- Whole wheat Pita Bread
- Grass fed butter 
- Organic Tortilla chips (with avocado or some type of greek yogurt dip I make) 
- Red meat (I like burgers, marinated steak) 
- Rice (Not the biggest fan, I usually limit rice) 
- Fairlife Milk
- Coffee (I make it from french press with no sugar)
- Matcha (usually with fairlife and maybe some organic maple syrup for sweetness if i make it cold) 
- Nuts (Pistachios, almonds) 
- Samosa (air fried frozen kinds, usually one for like 190 calories. Not my fav ntrient wise but it tastes good) 
- Avocado oil chips 
- Yes I like fries. I try to make them at home most times in avocado oil in the oven. But i'm a fiend for fries. üçü 

What hacks can I do to easily reduce some weight? Thank you üíÉ",1,1731312350.0,WeightLossAdvice,0,1.0,False

1gon9qh,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeddingPhotography/comments/1gon9qh/please_be_kind_i_need_advice/,Please be kind- I need advice ,"Today I messed up. I have NEVER done this before and I am reeling. Please be kind. I have never made a mistake like this before and have been taking pictures and been getting paid to do so since 2011. I started when I was a child, and it's been a hobbyist passion of mine for years and years. I am absolutely devastated and upset with myself. Please offer your advice if you have any. I'll include some backstory as well. 

TLDR; I shot JPEG unknowingly, and now I can't edit how I normally do and I am spiraling. Please help. 

So, I am in some local groups on FB where people can post looking for photographers for their event; and a lot of the posts are from women who are on super tight budgets. A lot of the replies are from photographers who are new/novices who are looking to get more for their portfolio, etc. I respond to these posts every once in a while. I saw a post for this potential client who posted about how tight their budget was and that they needed help, for a wedding coming up in less than 3 weeks...

I threw my hat in the ring and commented a few photos from the last wedding I did, and I offered to do it at the amount she posted was her budget ($500.00) out of the 100+ comments, she chose me because she likes the sample photos I included in my comments. 

I told her I would be willing to work with her budget and give 4 hours of coverage for that amount. She said that was all she needed and wanted anyway, and asked I show up at 3:30pm and shoot till 7:30. 

Mind you- this is less than 3 weeks out from the wedding day. I offered to do a consultation phone call or meet at a coffee shop or do a zoom, but she declined and reassured me she is low maintenance. She wasn't super forthcoming as far as a timeline and didn't really know what she wanted. So I kind of felt blind going into this. But, I felt little pressure because it was only a 500.00 budget. 

I asked her some questions and and answered hers, and then checked in 3 days before to make sure we were still on for the wedding date. She said yes, reviewed the contract, and everything was in motion...

Now: this is where I messed up. Or right before I messed up. 

Recently, I just purchased a 2nd hand camera body to be my back up. The brand and body is the same as my current; Nikon D750. It's affordable and I am comfy with Nikon and have multiple lenses for this body style. 

It had less than 29k actuations and was in perfect condition. My other body has WELL over 300k. 

SO- I switched over to the new/used body for this micro wedding I shot today, and went into autopilot when I arrived, threw my freshly charged battery in, got my SD cards in the slots, adjusted my settings to the room we were in for getting ready shots- and immediately chaos began. Immediately, one of thenThe little girls (of one of the bridesmaids) grabbed a curling iron while she was getting her hair done, and it stole my attention away. I offered some advice, and tried to get back to work...

Then, there was missing jewelry... then therr was a missing pair of shoes for a flower girl. Lots of helping look and running around. Then, a missing bucket of petals for one of the 4 flower girls, and children running around EVERYWHERE taking things and getting in front of my camera, every where I went. Constant asking me to look at their dancing, etc, etc. 

Normally- this wouldn't bother me at all- but my attention went elsewhere and I messed up- BECAUSE I didn't switch to RAW üò≠üíÄ

I LEFT IT HOW I BOUGHT IT.

AND IT WAS SHOOTING IN JPEG. üíîüíîüíî 

Now for some, this works just fine. For me- and how I edit, this is NOT fine. I am absolutely devastated. Now, I am protected by a contract... but this is not a clause I have. This is clearly my mistake.

If I can't figure some way out to make this editing process work for me, I am tempted to return the full $500.00 and edit what I can edit and make the gallery and send it off as is. 

She wanted a darker moodier vibe, and the venue was AWFUL conditions for having any sort of light. Natural or synthetic. 

I wasn't aware until I walked in the building today, that she wanted the over head lights turned off. Had curtains put up onto every window (black out curtains) and only wanted string lights (like for your Christmas tree. 4 strings total, making a square)lining the center of the grange hall. 

I argued my case to leave just 1 set of lights on, at least, if she would be willing, since i couldn't have any windows open or the back door open to let in a little bit of light, to have something more to work with. The stage lights she agreed could be on were harsh stage lights... pointed basically on top of the heads, up on the stage they were getting married on. This historical site was just not set up for success and has barely started allowing the public to rent it out for events. 

Now, I adjusted my settings in manual and they looked fine in camera. It was darker than I was used to, and looked to ""unscripted"" for some pointers on what settings I should start with in such a dark scenario. 

I continued on, and when things got dicey or more difficult for me, I turned to Auto- and went back and forth between that and manual and adjusted my settings as needed. 

As someone who doesn't do that many weddings or indoor shoots specifically (and bride knows this) I did my absolute best with the provided conditions. (Also side note: This historical grange hall did not allow flash photography due to all the historical art work and flags they had displayed around the building) 

The bride was fully aware I did mainly portraits and family and seniors, etc; all outdoors, and always shot during golden hour if at all possible. The optimal time for my editing style.

On the way to the Venus, she texted me asking if we could do her bridge and groom 1v1 shots AFTER her ceremony at that started at 530pm and head to the lake for photos after. I referred her back to our consultation and told her we would need to go before then, so we would have some sunlight. And ideally, shoot at around 425/430 ish for golden hour for where we are. They ended up agreeing at least to that. So we got decent photos at the lake today as the positive out of this experience. 

The bride and groom were so so so wonderful and kind. Problem is, I still can't edit them the way I would like to or use my presets as they are formulated for RAW images. I feel like I am in cement. 

I need some advice. Any tips or tricks to help me edit these JPEG images? Or; any recommendations for JPEG friendly presets? I can hand edit, and they look fine to me as a natural/airy style- but- if I try to make them moodier, all color gets lost. ",2,1731312208.0,WeddingPhotography,1,1.0,False

1gon7fd,https://www.reddit.com/r/RelationshipIndia/comments/1gon7fd/i_24m_found_my_partner_24f_texted_her_ex_in_a/,I (24M) found my partner (24F) texted her ex in a flirting way,"We have been together for more than 4 years now. We knew each other for a year before getting in a relationship, had our phases when we talked a lot, and fallouts as well during the year before getting together. 

Before me she had a casual thing with this guy for 4-5 months (let's call him Y), she made it pretty clear to him that it wasn't going to be (that's what she told me). They called it off, were friends after that. When she met me they still hung out together, once or twice a week, going out for eating or coffee. She made it very clear to me about exclusiveness of our relationship, also informed me about this guy Y.
During the last 4 years most of the arguments or fights we had was focused around Y. Because he was a creep, used to stalk her spotify, suggested songs to add to her personal playlists, constantly messaged her asking to meet. He's a creep also because he invaded her private space once without consent (leaving the details out), this happened before we got together. She told me about it. 

A year ago, we had a pretty serious argument about this same guy Y. Almost broke up. She decided to block him and told me that how I'm more important. But she left out a major detail out of it.

Last week I was going through her phone to check something, in there I had this urge to look at their chats, I opened it up. (Not the best thing to do, I regret it, or I don't?)

I found that during one of the night of our serious fight last year(lasted for 2-3 days), she texted him.
Now a little bit of background, since I found this guy so annoying, she decided she would just ghost him. They didn't have a conversation for the last 6 months before this fight. Then she texted him post our fight. Now this happened a year ago. And I found out last week.

The content of the chat were disturbing too. She knew very well that this guy liked her all along even when they were friends. Which she justified to me during the last few years as ""it's his issue, and I don't like him at all"", so it's alright,  I agreed.

The content of the texts had clear flirtatious tones, where she hits him up with texts like ""mere devdaas"" and similar teasings from her side. He too obliged flirtingly.
I didn't have the guts to read more.

I eventually confronted her, had a fight about it. She said that she accepted that the timing of the text was wrong. But she also maintains that there's nothing wrong in it and I am acting crazy like it's cheating, and that she doesn't regret it. Even asked me to ""move on"" from it.
The flirty texts she justified by saying they had this humour amongst themselves and it was normal between them to talk like that.

My concern over all this is, if I knew she had this kind of dynamic with a friend who was her ex, I would never have gotten together. That is just a personal preference,  because if I don't behave a certain way with the opposite gender it's fair to wanting a partner with the same preferences.And all this while I thought she had the same understanding as me, but after seeing these texts I feel like I was cheated.
Secondly there's also the fact she often pointed out that this happened a year ago and not to make a big deal out of it since post this she blocked the guy everywhere and they have no contact. 
But it still doesn't make it right, am I in the wrong to believe it?

I think it was a conscious decision to text this particular person, after a fight which was about him.
It would've made sense if they were in touch but they weren't for the last 6 months.

I don't really know how to feel about it and how to proceed. Cannot tell my close friends because I had this perfect thing as per them.
Need your suggestions as to how to proceed further.

1gon43z,https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/1gon43z/ambienzolpidem_for_jet_lag_with_provigilnuvigil/,Ambien/Zolpidem for Jet Lag with Provigil/Nuvigil,"1.)  I have used Ambien/Zolpidem many times for Jet Lag.  I am a large male and take 10 mg right after they serve supper and if there is at least 4 hours till your scheduled arrival you should be fine.  By 2 hours it is down to 5 mg, by 4 hours 2.5 mg, by 6 hours 1.25 mg, and by 8 to 12 hours all gone.  I would NOT mix it with alcohol.  Ask you medical doctor to enough tablets for 5 to 7 nights going, and 7 nights when you get back.  If you are a small woman your doctor will want you to take 5 mg the same way.   If you wake up in 4 hours and have 4 more hours to sleep before you land you can repeat 1/2 tablet of either original dose  at that time.  Some people are more sensitive than others so it is OK to try 1/2 tablet or 1/4 little bit even for the first dose and see how it works.  Food in the stomach slows down absorption and the onset of sleepiness, so if you have just eaten a meal within 2-3 hours try sucking the somewhat bitter tablet under your tongue till it dissolves and try to not rinse your mouth till the bitter taste goes away.  It can absorb quicker sublingual than oral.  If you can't afford a business class sleep bed, then use a neck pillow and ear plugs or sound canceling headphones. And wear comfortable clothes to sleep in.    
2.) Some people the next day can keep awake with coffee (brewed is stronger than expresso) but it doesn't work for everyone. For the in the morning you can ask your doctor for a similar small prescription for Provigil or Nuvigil  200 mg for big adult or 100 mg for small woman.  It keeps you awake without being buzzed.   10 tablet Rx,  for the first 5 days going and the same 5 days after you get home will greatly diminish your symptoms of jet lag.  You may not need all 5 doses, stop when you feel normal during the days.  Used this occasional way they are not habituating.  And don't text message or buy anything till the Ambien/Zolpidem wears off after at least 4-8 hours of sleep.  

I've traveled international at least 15 times and it has made Jet lag a lot less of an issue.  The other way is just have 5 extra days and don't do anything except lie around and sleep a lot those days before you start your tour.  This works now that I am retired .  Or break up long flights with  one night stopovers to sleep a night between flights, like Seattle to New York, sleep.  New York to Iceland sleep one or two nights and soak in the Blue Lagoon for a day, and then go on to Norway or Sweden or Denmark to start your tour, semi rested.   If flying to Africa stop over for 1 or 2  nights in Istanbul, Duba. or Addis Abba to sleep and see a little of another county.   I still use the Ambien to get sleep in each stopover, but find I need less Provigil, and really do get there ready to go and fully enjoy wherever in Europe we travel.  I am retired MD, FP.  And Tropical Medicine Specialist. DTM&H.  Get your Rx from your one family doctor.  Or see a sleep specialist if they are not up to date on Rx of Jet Lag.",1,1731311522.0,insomnia,0,1.0,False

It would be a miracle if you get to see this and I really hope you do 

The only reason I‚Äôm posting in here is because I have no other way to contact you. Without knowing your surname etc in a city of 5M there must be hundreds of thousands of Dan‚Äôs here 

I tried to post this a long time ago in a Sydney group but they refused and it just doesn‚Äôt belong in any other thread except for this one. So here we are‚Ä¶

Note: this is going to be a very long post so that the Dan who this is for is in no doubt it‚Äôs for him. Everyone else can expect to be bored out of their minds so read at your own peril‚Ä¶ long story of missed opportunities due to COVID and our own ineptitude and no way to contact each other 

Dear Dan,

I still feel terrible about the last time I saw you (a year ago) at the bar we know each other from. I didn‚Äôt actually recognise you (as it had been so long - since Covid lockdowns started) and you looked very different (leaner, older, dressed differently and your very distinctive hair was now cut off) and you acted so differently too - well except for not approaching me and just being nearby and the place was packed like sardines as usual and I don‚Äôt really ever pay much attention to anyone standing near or behind me when I‚Äôm just chatting to my friends 

I wish that you had just come directly up to me when you first appeared and said Hi Diana, remember me or something. 

I would have been super happy to talk to you as have thought of you often since Covid kicked in just when we finally started to talk and then on the first day that everything reopened after that first lockdown when you obvs went there in case I returned but that day I was in the middle of moving house and finally permitted to go get things from my work (right near that bar) and was dashing from my office to get to Telstra in person before they closed as had been impossible to get things organised at my new house so I dashed past the bar and know that you saw me and that indeed it was you that tried to intercept me at the street crossing 

At first glance I thought it was you but then it was dark, you were dressed so differently and had your distinctive hair hidden in a beanie so when you stood next to me at the busy street crossing across from the Telstra shop which was closing in 5 mins I glanced at you again and thought nooo that is someone else. I also was focused on the crossing and was exhausted from my house move and freezing (couldn‚Äôt find my warm clothes or jackets as still had hundreds of boxes piled to the roof in my new house) and it was dark, super windy with my hair blowing over my face and eyes 

I thought IF that‚Äôs you, you would say Hi etc, but I also thought well we are both crossing in the same direction so I will double check if it is you on the other side and I do get hyper vigilant on busy crossings after a traumatic accident I had in the last past being a pedestrian with an elderly out of control/oblivious driver SO at any road crossing particularly super busy ones I always have all my focus on the cars

I could feel you looking at me like you were willing me to look at you but I thought you would say something as I wasn‚Äôt even sure it was you anyway with your completely different clothes and your beanie covering your hair and a fair bit of your face anyway and I just can‚Äôt break my focus on the road so I kept looking forward and thought well see when we get to the other side. But you marched off probably assuming that I definitely knew it was you and chose to ignore you and also that was at the Telstra store that I had to get into with 5 mins to spare

I thought that I would see you again at the bar soon enough anyway but even though I did go back it wasn‚Äôt often as it was such a hassle to book a table and with myself and all of my friends still working from home for years. So I went back just not often and you could have gone there hundreds of times just never when I was there

But i hoped one day I would see you again but never did until last time around this time last year which had been so long that I wasn‚Äôt expecting to see you years later.

I genuinely didn‚Äôt recognise you that night - you looked so different and were acting differently too being outside when you never were in the hundred or so times we saw each other before Covid, drinking wine etc when you only ever drank beer etc so many small things. There have always been 2 other men that go there that look extremely similar to you that were always outside etc and because I have worked right near there for years to me you looked very familiar but so does almost everyone since that‚Äôs mine and my friends regular pub and I constantly bump into other people that also go there and to same lunch, coffee places etc etc as me so yes you looked very familiar but I didn‚Äôt actually recognise it was YOU

When some of my friends noticed you hovering and looking at me, they asked me if i knew you and I glanced at you and said NO, I don‚Äôt know him - if I did I‚Äôd talk to him (I‚Äôm a super friendly person so I always say hi to everyone I know)

So many things about that night I wish went differently. Firstly that you didn‚Äôt just come talk to me earlier in the evening

Then when you finally plucked up the courage to come and talk to me later you were so drunk that firstly you didn‚Äôt make any sense - if you remember I had gone inside by myself to get a drink where I bumped into another male friend of mine who I chatted to for a few minutes before and after being served and then when you appeared you were very unsteady on your feet 

You started talking about how you could understand why I liked ‚Äòhim‚Äô and that I could go out with whomever I want but ‚Äòhe‚Äô wouldn‚Äôt treat me right

I had no idea what on earth you were talking about-or even WHO you were referring to (that friend I just spoke to just before that) or one of my friends I was hanging out with outside since they were also all males.

Absolutely none of them is anything other than one of my friends, or outside some of them were my friends work colleagues etc. I‚Äôm a friendly and social person and yes often hug my male friends or they kiss me on the cheek etc as a friendly hello greeting etc but yes to me your comments weren‚Äôt making any sense at all and you definitely had had way too much to drink and were very unsteady on your feet

So that‚Äôs why I said I thought you needed to go home as I was worried you might fall over and hurt yourself especially on that brutal staircase and genuinely you really weren‚Äôt making any sense at all but you were still gracious and polite and apologised for bothering me and 

Then you went to wait for your friend outside far away from me I assume to give me space which I wasn‚Äôt meaning that you had to do that just really I genuinely thought you needed to get a cab home as you weren‚Äôt in a good state to be out 

While you were standing over there I was definitely thinking that you were so familiar and trying to work out where I know you from especially after our conversation and then when you had to come back to me looking for your laptop you had left behind and your friend arrived to help you - it was only just after you left that I finally clicked that it was YOU

The man I had hoped to see again and have felt terrible ever since about what a crap night that must have been for you (especially since I think your laptop had been stolen to add insult to injury) and ever since then I have hoped that I would run into you again and get to have a proper conversation and a laugh about the ridiculousness of it all

It has been a year since then and while I still go back to that bar it‚Äôs not often maybe once a week as my friends and I are still working from home most days and I think that you probably felt embarrassed and that I was obviously not interested or doubting if I ever was

So I want you to know that yes, I was always interested and still would have been that night too - if only you had just talked to me earlier or if only I had recognised you 

Even when you finally did approach me being that drunk - I still would have told you that you needed to go home (you really did!! As I‚Äôm sure you and your mate that came to help you know) but I would have exchanged numbers with you and told you to call me another day

But once again I didn‚Äôt know it was you until it was too late and I imagine that you must have felt embarrassed and totally rejected and probably will never step foot back there again

That was a year ago and I‚Äôm sure you have moved on -if I find you so attractive I‚Äôm sure many other women do too but I do want you to know that no you were never imagining the huge attraction between us. It was there from the first time we made eye contact and all the hundreds of times after that

I have never felt so drawn to anyone in my life and when we first saw each other I really wasn‚Äôt remotely interested in seeing anyone at that time (I had just ended a 4yr relationship) so your shyness actually made you even more attractive and was so refreshing from men that usually just crack on to me the minute we meet

I liked you more for your gentle approach and was always hugely attracted to you from the instant our eyes met

It was such a shame Covid shut downs happened when they did because things finally seemed to be inching forwards and I felt sooo ready and how I wish you had talked to me that first night after the first lockdown ended at the street crossing 

Or if anything different had happened last time, if I had instantly recognised you I would have talked to you immediately. If when my friends had said ‚Äòdo you know that guy?‚Äô If instead of me taking a brief glance at you in that weird street lighting outside and saying no, I wish I just said to you ‚Äòdo I know you???‚Äô

Or if you hadn‚Äôt started talking nonsense to me when you did finally talk to me inside and just simply said Hi Diana, do you remember me

Just so many tiny things that if just one was different on that night and I knew it was you things would have been so different 

I know it would be a miracle if you see this. But I so hope that you do and at least if I put this out here it‚Äôs at least possible that you might stumble across it as I don‚Äôt want you to feel embarrassed- who hasn‚Äôt made a drunken fool of themselves and I think it‚Äôs pretty funny well aside from the sheer disappointment of knowing that once again we both missed yet another opportunity which is sadly probably final

If you do see this, it‚Äôs definitely not final for me. I rarely meet anyone I like enough to want to go out with romantically as I only want to see someone I know I could feel everything for, I don‚Äôt go out with someone just to be seeing someone I do prefer to wait 

I have had a few relationships since Covid but they haven‚Äôt worked out because I knew it wasn‚Äôt going to be everything I wanted and I think because I have never stopped thinking about you and wondering what if

What if you had just talked to me that day you intercepted me at the pedestrian crossing?? What if I just recognised you last time 

What if we weren‚Äôt such bumbling fools just before lockdown happened?

What if, what if what if??

It‚Äôs true that the worst regrets are the things you didn‚Äôt do for sure

So. This is why I‚Äôm writing you this letter that I so wish I could really send to you. It‚Äôs unsent only because I have absolutely no way to contact you 

If I had known your surname I would‚Äôve tried to find you on Facebook or LinkedIn etc and sent you a message for sure but I don‚Äôt so I can‚Äôt because in a city of 5 million people there are just tens or hundreds of thousands of Dan‚Äôs

I want you to know that you weren‚Äôt delusional-I always wanted you then and I still do now

It makes me feel sad that due to COVID and of course our own ineptitude that we missed so many opportunities to actually get to know each other 

If you see this then you can message me here, or go back to the bar and if so just come up and talk to me. 

I know that it must feel very intimidating to try to approach me when I‚Äôm usually in a large pack of friends especially given that the majority of them are men

I never considered that before since that has never stopped other men from just coming over to hit on me until it dawned on me that that‚Äôs because they were just players who are used to hitting on women all the time and you were always too respectful and gracious to behave like that

Which is why I finally went over and introduced myself to you that time which is something I never ever do so that was a big move on my part and I only did that to give you the confidence to just come talk to me after that

Anyway if you do come back please know that I would love it if you came to talk to me and that pretty much every other man I talk to there is just a friend or acquaintance of mine - not a romantic interest. If I was on a date it would never be there!!!

If you have moved on then I still hope you see this and know that you weren‚Äôt ever wrong and your instincts were correct and didn‚Äôt fail you and that I will always think of you in a positive light

I hope you are happy and doing great as you are a lovely man and deserve nothing but happiness 

From Diana

1gomys2,https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyPlanning/comments/1gomys2/trip_review_2_days_at_dlp_with_a_1_year_old/,Trip Review - 2 days at DLP with a 1 year old,"Heya folks!  I got a lot of help here on planning our first Disneyland trip with our toddler, and I wanted to give back to the community by sharing our experiences with y'all.  Our toddler is 16 months old, and we did 2 days at Disneyland - no California Adventure for this trip. 

Day 0 - Arrival in Anaheim

* We flew in from Hawaii, where there is no good jewish deli, so I wanted to make sure to get some on this trip.  Headed over to Benjies, which is enroute from SNA, and it was absolutely incredible, could go toe to toe with any NY jewish deli.  So good we got it again at the end of the trip on our way back.
* We stayed at the Clementine Hotel, which we were really happy with. As far as I could tell, it was one of the few (only?) hotels that had fireplaces in the rooms, which my wife loves. We picked up some duraflame logs at Vons and enjoyed a nice fire every night after the baby had gone to bed. The hotel also had a pretty good breakfast buffet, full kitchen in the room, kids playroom, pool, and sport courts. Was about a 10-15min walk from the front gates and the room was quite affordable.  Would definitely stay here again
* On our first night we went to O Happy Nails and got disney-themed pedicures - my wife got minnie nails and i got sorcerer mickey. The nail technicians were super nice and accommodating and did a great job, this was a really fun thing to do on our first night to get ready for our trip.

Day 1: Wed Oct 30

* Not sure if it was because it was a weekday, or because it was the day before a major holiday, but the park was empty on our first day which was amazing.  Granted, we didn't do any of the more popular rides because of the baby, but the rides we did do never had a wait of more than 10 minutes.
* I entered the VQ for Haunted Mansion a minute or two after 7 - I was in an early queue, but the ride was closed for the entire morning so we didn't end up getting called until about 5pm.  We were at dinner during the boarding group window, but we went afterwards and were told that you could enter any time after your boarding group was called, even if your boarding window was expired. We tried again the next day, but unfortunately the ride closed right as we were entering and didn't open for the rest of the night.
* We weren't interested in rushing or rope dropping, so we entered the park around 9:30. Made our way to Starbucks which was great, probably one of the longest lines of our whole trip, lol. Good stop for the baby because they had milk and uncrustables there.
* Our first destination was Adventureland. Started with the tiki room, which was fun as always.  This was probably when our little one realized that this was not going to be a normal day - totally captivated by the parrots and lights.
* Side note, OH MY GOD THE FAMILY RESTROOMS AT TIKI ROOM. Probably the highlight of our trip, lol. They were clean and private and perfect for changing him and taking a short breather from the crowds and energy of the park.  We basically came back to these restrooms every time we needed to use the bathroom, highly recommended for toddler parents.
* After tiki room, we went on jungle cruise. I think our toddler liked this one a bit less, but the motion of the boat was highly effective at inducing sleep because the minute we got off the ride, he took his nap. We were worried about if he'd be able to nap and tried to research ""good"" nap places for him, but in the end he pretty much just got exhausted and fell asleep in his stroller and we'd seek out places that weren't too noisy so he could get some shut-eye in.
* While he napped, we headed over to Tropical Hideaway for the Tajin dole whip, which was absolutely amazing.  Loved the chunks of pickle in it, definitely elevated it to a new level.  Then we headed over to Bengal Barbeque for some skewers, which were really good as well.
* After lunch we headed over to New Orleans Square.  Took our time looking in the shops - this was a theme of this trip, usually we just rush by the shops because we have rides to get to, but with the little one we had more time to take it slow and check everything out.  After the shops I wanted to get my beignet fix in so we went and got that as well.
* The toddler was starting to wake up at this point, so we headed to Pirates which at the time only had a 10 minute line.  This was probably the most thrill-like ride we went on and our toddler absolutely loved it.  Any ride where there was a bar that came down, he really enjoyed because he could sit on his own and hold on to it.  Didn't really have any reaction to the drops but was very captivated by the scenes.
* Went over to Fantasyland and did Pinocchio and Mr. Toad (what an effed up ride, lol. Nightmare fuel.).  Again he liked the scenes and being able to hold on to the bar.
* By this time it was mid-afternoon and we had an early dinner reservation at Napa Rose.  My wife wanted to get a dress while we were there for the occasion so we headed to Downtown Disney and the Disney Dress Shop - which was a bit underwhelming.  We were hoping for a store full of dresses, but really it was more of a general Disney clothing store.  There were two dresses available, though, and my wife got the Hocus Pocus dress which she was very happy with.
* We headed over to Napa Rose which was wonderful - by this time it was getting late for our little one and he was starting to get cranky, but we powered through the dinner reservation and the staff were very accommodating for us. Dinner was great - the steak was probably in the top 5 best steaks I've ever had in my life. 
* Of course, the minute we left dinner with our cranky toddler, he swiftly fell asleep. We headed back into the park and decided to check out Galaxy's Edge, which we had never been to before.  Going for the first time at night was a great decision - the immersion was incredible and we had a great time walking around and seeing all the sites. 
* On our way out of the park, our toddler woke up and we figured we'd try and get in to our Haunted Mansion VQ.  There was no line whatsoever - we literally walked up with our passes and went straight into the elevator room.  The glass breaking in the elevator ceiling was the one thing that frightened our toddler, but he didn't cry and enjoyed the rest of the ride with us a lot.

Day 2: Thu Oct 31

* Whereas the park was empty on day 1, day 2 was halloween and the park was packed especially at the end of the night since DCA closed early for Oogie Boogie.
* We grabbed Starbucks and headed over to Galaxy's Edge, where we had a morning reservation at Oga's Cantina.  We don't really drink but the non-alcoholic drinks were still really fun, the vibe was perfect and the edamame was very tasty. Definitely paid off to get a reservation since there was a long standby line to get in.
* After Oga's we headed back towards main street, where my wife wanted to walk through every single store, which we did - again, this was a fun different thing since normally we just blow by the stores. Bought a couple trinkets.
* I wanted a turkey leg, so we grabbed that from Tomorrowland and then took some pictures - the toddler was dressed as Peter Pan for Halloween which was really perfect. 
* The little one fell asleep, so we headed back up to Galaxy's Edge to check out Docking Bay 7, where the food was incredible.  Definitely the best restaurant in DLP, we both agreed that if it was a restaurant at home we'd be going there every week.  Why doesn't everyone have that cocoa pebbles cream cheese coffee!!!
* On our way back down to the rest of the park, we randomly ran into a parade of characters which was fantastic.  My wife was really hoping to see Hook (she was bounding as Tinkerbell) and we got the perfect selfie with him. Probably one of the best moments of the entire trip.
* Randomly spotted the Green Apple churro in Tomorrowland, which was incredible.  The caramel sauce and the green apple powder, amazing.
* Rode Pirates one more time, the line was much longer this time and we ended up waiting about 30min to get in.
* Headed over to Blue Bayou where we had a 5pm reservation. Our little one was much less cranky this time and we had a great dinner.  I think the food quality has improved since we were last there a few years ago, because I found it quite tasty. 
* Our last ride of the trip was Peter Pan, which was a very long line and in retrospect was shorter than I remember, it was practically over before it started. Still enjoyable, though.
* Headed back over to Galaxy's Edge (a lot of back and forth on this day, in retrospect I probably would have organized things a bit better with regard to walking around to the different areas) where we got some photographer shots with the Millenium Falcon. 
* Shortly after this our toddler fell asleep - we debated staying for the fireworks but we're not fans of big crowds and the amount of people that were there was absolutely insane.  All of main street was packed shoulder-to-shoulder.  We passed by the Tomorrowland terrace and saw the balcony where you could reserve a table and that seemed totally worth the money, even if the food served was less than satisfactory - you're paying for a quiet place to watch the show, not the food. Would definitely try and get a reservation for this next time, assuming our kid is old enough to stay up for the show by then.

All in all we had a fantastic time - I don't think our 1yo was old enough to understand the Disney-ness of it all, but I think he knew he was somewhere special and he had a really good time.

There's something I've noticed about Disney, and also about holidays. When you're a kid, and you go to Disneyland or its Christmas, it seems like wondrous magic is all around you, it's incredible.  Then, you get older, and you can still have fun at these places, but now you can see that it was adults, whether they are the employees of Disneyland or your parents at Christmas, who are working hard to make this magic happen. It's still fun, but the magic is no longer there. However, what I've learned from this trip is that there is a new level of fun you get to experience once you're a parent - you get to be the magician now, you get to put the hard work in to make the magic happen and see that wonderment again on your child's face when they experience it. I'm not sure if, at 1 year old, he really got the full ""magic"" experience, but I do think he had some sense that this wasn't his average day, and that he had a lot of fun taking everything in. Very much looking forward to going back when he's a bit older and has more of an understanding of Disney movies and the storytelling associated with the park.

**Why Outsourcing Market Research Can Be a Game-Changer for Small Businesses and Startups**

If you run a business or startup, you probably know how challenging (and expensive) it can be to keep up with market trends, understand customer needs, and stay one step ahead of the competition. Many companies find themselves stuck in a cycle of trial and error, trying to gain insights without the resources of larger competitors. That‚Äôs where outsourcing market research comes in. Here‚Äôs why more and more businesses are opting to bring in outside research experts‚Äîand why it might be the smartest move for your business.

# 1. You Get Pro-Level Insights Without the Full-Time Staff

Hiring a whole team dedicated to market research is a luxury most small companies can‚Äôt afford. But outsourcing allows you to tap into the skills and experience of pros who do this for a living. These are people who can pull insights from customer behavior, forecast trends, and dig into your competition‚Äîall without you needing to build an entire department.

Take this stat: According to Deloitte, 59% of companies outsource to save on costs. For small businesses, that could mean freeing up thousands (if not more) in labor expenses. And it‚Äôs not just about saving money‚Äîthese research teams often have tools, data subscriptions, and methods that would cost you a lot to access independently.

**Example**: A small coffee roaster looking to expand into new regions might outsource their market research to understand the customer base in those areas. Instead of hiring a team to figure it all out from scratch, they could have a research consultant pinpoint exactly which cities are most receptive to their brand, saving them time and money.

# 2. Flexibility to Respond to Changes Fast

Ever feel like the market changes overnight? It pretty much does. Trends, consumer demands, and competition can shift in an instant, and the companies that succeed are the ones that can adapt quickly. According to Statista, 78% of companies that use consumer data for quick decision-making see better results in the long run.

When you outsource, you get the benefit of real-time insights without needing an in-house team on standby. Say you‚Äôre about to launch a new product or enter a new market‚Äîan outsourced research team can dive deep into the latest trends, consumer preferences, and competitive analysis, all on a tight timeline.

**Example**: Imagine a small skincare brand looking to expand from the U.S. to Europe. Instead of taking the time (and cash) to train a team on European market regulations and customer tastes, they could outsource to an expert familiar with the market, giving them faster, more accurate insights with less overhead.

# 3. Save on Costs While Still Getting High-Quality Research

Maintaining a full-time research team doesn‚Äôt just mean paying salaries. There‚Äôs training, data costs, and often a significant lag before teams can start delivering value. Outsourcing, on the other hand, allows you to get the research you need, when you need it, and only pay for what‚Äôs essential to your business goals.

In other words, you‚Äôre not spending money on research until it directly aligns with a priority project. For a lot of small businesses, that‚Äôs the difference between smart spending and stretching the budget too thin.

**Example**: For a bootstrapped tech startup, outsourcing market research only during a major launch or funding round can mean better resource allocation. They‚Äôre putting their cash where it counts‚Äîon customer feedback or competitive analysis at key times, rather than maintaining a team year-round.

# Is Outsourcing Right for Your Business?

At the end of the day, outsourcing market research offers small businesses and startups a way to compete with the ‚Äúbig dogs‚Äù without the same budget. By choosing research partners wisely, you can tap into serious expertise, get quick insights when the market shifts, and spend only when it aligns with your current goals.

In an economy where data drives everything, having the right insights isn‚Äôt just an advantage‚Äîit‚Äôs essential. If staying competitive without breaking the bank sounds good, it‚Äôs probably worth considering a research partner.

(Sorry for any grammatical or spelling mistakes!)

Here we go!

1. A customer complained that our floor-to-ceiling windows were too clean, and she almost walked into them. She asked if we could put up a sign or something warning future customers and informing them what's windows and where the actual door is. 

2. A gentleman complained that his Cappuccino wasn't hot enough after I made it to 80 degrees Celsius which is considered extra EXTRA hot. Customer then compared the temperature of his coffee to his friend's pot of tea, which obviously contained boiling water. I had to explain basic physics to a senior gentleman and how water boils at 100 degrees and milk burns at around 90-95 degrees. I said if I was to burn his milk it would taste very bad and give the coffee a crunchy texture. Customer then told me he in fact did not care for the taste and only cared for the temperature. Sure...

3. A customer ordered a meat-lovers pizza, then asked why there was bacon on it...

4. A customer rang the phone 10 minutes before we closed if he could have a coffee. I told him we were about to close and that I couldn't make a coffee as the machine was off. He then asked what other cafes were open... Like I would know. I told him no as we are one of the only places nearby still open until 5 o'clock, most cafes close at around 2 or 3 o'clock. The customer then complained that he wanted a coffee RIGHT NOW. I apologised and reiterated what I said prior about the coffee machine. Yeah, the dude hung up on me... I was a little offended, mainly because I wish I was the one to hang up on him.

5. A customer asked for a long black and to make it extra hot... Soooo you want me to make your boiling water and coffee... Hotter? Ok

6. A woman complained that there was not enough ice in her iced latte. After adding more ice she then complained it was too watery.

7. Customer complained about too many flies... while sitting outside.

8. A man claimed he was discriminated against because we asked him to leave. We asked him this 20 minutes after we had closed. He responded by throwing his coffee on the floor and then walking off. Real mature, sir.

9. A man got mad and swore at me because he had to wait 6 minutes for a ham and cheese croissant. I told him that since he wanted it toasted it had to go in the oven for 4 minutes, the other 2 minutes was grabbing it and wrapping it to go for him. After giving him the croissant, he then complained that his pasty that he was holding had gone cold due to him waiting 'so long' and demanded a new one. Patience may be a virtue, but a rarity.

and finally 10. Getting asked the same question almost every day by random old men... 'How do you milk an almond.' Apparently, giving them a proper answer, aka blending them, isn't the answer they like and they feel the need to explain, 'iT's A jOkE!' to me, like I'm an idiotic blonde woman, even after I tell them I hear the joke EVERY DAY... 

  
Ooo bonus one, for my fellow peeps with mental disabilities! I had a customer tell me that 'dyslexia isn't real' and that it was all in my head after I apologised and explained my disability when I had trouble counting their change. I also mentioned that I had been noticing improvements in my maths abilities only that day wasn't my day. The customer then said, ""The main reason you probably think you're getting better working with money is because you're an adult and your finally using more of your brain!"" I laughed at them... Could have just nodded and went on with your day but you had to try to make me look stupid only to make yourself look like an ass.

I‚Äôm taking courses at a community college in preparation for a 4 year university. when I started I basically had $600 to my name and got picked up by my new landlord in a green pick up truck and went off alone into the city. It‚Äôs been 2 years, and I‚Äôm more stable, but it also feels like I am less financially and emotionally stable. because I was running on fumes to get straight As the first year(I took it slow, as close to 12 credit hours as possible and didn‚Äôt really work), as soon as I got some stability by moving in with my girlfriends family, I collapsed. I had been totally clean from video games and tv, but I started to relax and play games again, I felt so stressed. And now I was very unnerved relying on a relationship for my housing, despite how much I trust them, I knew I wouldn‚Äôt be able to get a legit lease on my own, and i have no family cosign me. it feels as if the luster of the city has worn off, and I am tired again. My ADHD and mainly CPTSD are very crippling. Some days i have nothing to eat but a large coffee drink.   the depression I feel at night is terrible, I feel many nights that my life isn‚Äôt worth living.

i keep sacrificing a lot for my degree. It is what will allow me to support myself on the amount of work I can do, which is not full time. I don‚Äôt know why, but mentally I can barely handle more than 30 hours of work per week or things start to get extremely bad. And they have been lately. I thought with the cushion I made for myself in the first couple semesters, it would get easier because I could let my grades slip a bit. But the expectations just keep getting higher. Calculus 2 was unexpectedly difficult and time-consuming, and now I have a sudden scholarship to prepare for. It is the be all end all, because it is enough to basically guarantee I don‚Äôt have to take out more than 10,000 in loans, and the applicant pool is limited to a group I‚Äôm in of 76 people and they are choosing 8 of us. I immediately added on a crucial project on to my workload to qualify for the scholarship. it felt like things were cranked up to 11. I couldn‚Äôt sleep, obsessively thinking about the things I have to do. During breaks, my functioning is declining. I wear the same clothes for a week and let my space get very gross. 

it‚Äôs just too much. I used to have 1 coffee a week but now it‚Äôs most days. I have resonated with dr k saying that we are most proud of ourselves when things are hard. And that was the case when I started, when things were new and inspiring and fun, but not now. I am tired. It feels like nothing will ever get better. If i don‚Äôt get this scholarship I don‚Äôt know what I will do, because honestly my finances after community college were always a nebulous thing, but they are coming fast and it‚Äôs not looking good. especially with the current job market, i don‚Äôt know if I will ever be not struggling in the next 5 years.",1,1731309751.0,Healthygamergg,1,1.0,False

I vape a little too frequently and just recovering from alcohol use disorder with my last relapse being almost two months ago. To start I definitely think this is from drinking heavily for Years before going on a sobriety journey. 

So last year alcoholism was bad like all day everyday in 2023. And in those times the veins beside my eyes would often feel really strained. So in these two months it felt like things cleared up mostly and I felt healthy once quitting drinking. Its only recently I get this intense pain by my eye- sometimes it pulses and sometimes I need to shut my eyes to feel okay. Usually only in the evening does this happen- could it be paws and my brain settling, screen time, vaping etc- the fact that ot only happens at night and goes away after I sleep. Any suggestions? I'll post a picture in comments- that's tonight and it's especially bad today.

Edit to add: today it felt like this came on after I had three cups of coffee instead of my normal two- and it's not everyday but just recently on certain evenings. I probably have too much screen time too",4,1731309687.0,AskDocs,2,1.0,False

Been married for 44 years straight out of high school,"Married at 18 both of us, went to college together, got jobs, went to graduate schools while working full time jobs, had 3 kids and all that entails‚Ä¶.yet even while that busy, exhausted he would still call me by my pet name, give me a kiss or hug just because , and often tell me he loved me . This was at least solid for 25-30 years of marriage. He threw a huge party to celebrate our 25th anniversary even tho that‚Äôs not really his thing. It was amazing! Flash forward to about 8 years ago‚Ä¶.. we both began planning to retire , looking forward to it but life doesn‚Äôt always go as planned. We ended up deciding together to fight for custody of our 3 grandsons due to their parents substance abuse issues, mental health problems , homelessness and multiple jail times. I know we both went into it thinking ( hoping) this would not be long term, that at least 1 of their parents would get their act together but that has not happened and it looks like we will be raising them until they are each able to be on their own  currently they are 15, 8 and 7 years old. I feel like he blames me for us taking them in even tho we decided together. He tells me I am the reason why our son turned out like he did . I was eligible for retirement when we were awarded custody of all 3 boys so I retired from a job I loved because financially with child care for 3 kids it more financial sense to draw retirement and not have to pay all of that money for childcare. I will admit raising them is tiring and. All consuming. It often feels like my husband thinks I‚Äôm choosing the grandkids over him because I do have to focus on them with the struggles they have so I can see where he might feel neglected. My husband often jots down notes of things he needs to remember to do or the needs  to pick up at a store. A few years ago I saw one laying on his bathroom vanity that said simply ‚Äúquit parenting, I‚Äôm done‚Äù  . And admittedly I have been totally responsible for everything regarding the kids, all of the housework, shopping, meal prep, attending school functions, etc. He does work very hard at his job but as soon as he gets home he immediately pulls out his phone and computer, goes downstairs and stays until after everyone is in bed and then he may venture back up to go to bed with me. I‚Äôve tried talking to him about all of these things ( he says I just want to fight‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs actually the last thing I want)I‚Äôve tried improving my looks, being more sexual in bed.helping with whatever projects of his that I can but I feel as if I‚Äôm not getting anywhere. I don‚Äôt want constant attention and lovey words but it hurts and confuses me as to why he won‚Äôt at least make small attempts at claim my pet name every now and then , Just sitting for coffee for 15 mins, cuddling for 30 minutes watching Netflix ‚Ä¶ if he gives it a half hearted try he has his phone out the entire time on social media or messaging other people which leaves me feeling even more alone than before. . I‚Äôve tried talking to him several times over the last 8 years about ‚Äúhey do you realize how long it‚Äôs been since you told me you love me‚Äù Why don‚Äôt you ever call me ‚Äúbabe‚Äù anymore? He just always refuses to answer or shrugs it off or just walks away. Has anyone ever experienced anything like this? I really don‚Äôt expect him to fawn over me like he did when we were 18 but is it asking to much to hear I love you‚Äù every now and then! Does this happen to everyone that been together for for this long or is it possible he won‚Äôt say it anymore because he doesn‚Äôt feel it and he doesn‚Äôt want to lie to me about it? I am so confused. I love this man for getting us where we have made it to in this life. We have been a great team But at the same time I really need to feel that I am loved, that he wants to be with me.ive even been getting a nanny to stay with the grandkids so we can travel together like we talked about our entire lives. Our trip can range from 3 days-10 days so far .

Last year after begging my doctor to test me because my fatigue was so consistent and never-ending, I tested positive for mono. Which I thought was the answer. However, it‚Äôs been a year and I know mono symptoms like fatigue can last up 6 months or longer‚Äî but I have other symptoms. 

Physical: First is the charley horses. Which are almost daily. They always happen when I‚Äôm laying down in bed or sometimes sitting, but never after long exercise or physical labor (which I don‚Äôt do anyways because I never have the energy). I also have constant joint discomfort in my knees. constant. It‚Äôs bearable but bordering on painful.

Cognitive: Next is difficulty speaking/finding words/mispronouncing words/slurring speech AND memory issues/gaps in my memory (both short and long term). I didn‚Äôt realize how big of an issue these were till I moved in with my roommate. I‚Äôll bring up stories, topics, or thoughts of mine that I think are new and my roommate will explain how we had just talked about that exact thing a day or week ago and I have no recollection whatsoever. This happens a lot. I‚Äôll also say something completely different than what I intended to say, get words mixed up often. Can‚Äôt read stuff for school due to problems concentrating.

Restless sleep. I haven‚Äôt had one night where I slept through the night. No matter how much sleep I get I‚Äôm still tired. Have to take a breath and stop when I‚Äôm walking up hill to class. Coffee does not energize me at all. 

I feel so hopeless and tried mentally too of all this. Please let me know if this sound like CFS could be the case for me.",1,1731308514.0,cfs,2,1.0,False

1gomawm,https://www.reddit.com/r/OutdoorGearHub/comments/1gomawm/best_camping_dinnerware_from_trail_mistakes_to/,Best Camping Dinnerware - From Trail Mistakes to Campsite Mastery üèïÔ∏è,"After 7 years of regular camping and backpacking across different terrains and seasons, I've accumulated enough dinnerware disasters and victories to write a book. Instead, I'm sharing this comprehensive guide that I wish I had when I started. Grab your favorite camp mug, and let's dive in! ‚õ∫

# The Great Dinnerware Disaster of 2019 üòÖ

Picture this: A crisp autumn evening in the Adirondacks, my first ""serious"" camping trip with my partner. I thought I was clever bringing our regular ceramic plates from home because they were ""just so much nicer than camping gear."" Fast forward to dinner time - we're huddled around the campfire, and I drop my plate. Not only did it shatter into a million pieces, but we spent an hour making sure we collected every shard to leave no trace. The next morning, we had to share one plate between us, awkwardly taking turns eating our scrambled eggs. That was the moment I realized camping dinnerware isn't just about eating - it's about safety, convenience, and protecting our environment.

# Understanding What Makes Great Camping Dinnerware ü§î

# Essential Qualities:

1. **Durability**
   * *Must withstand drops on rocky surfaces*
   * *Should handle temperature changes*
   * *Needs to resist scratches and dents*
2. **Portability**
   * *Lightweight enough for backpacking*
   * *Compact design for limited space*
   * *Stackable or nesting capabilities*
3. **Functionality**
   * *Heat resistance for hot meals*
   * *Non-slip bottom for stability*
   * *Multi-purpose uses when possible*
4. **Cleaning Ease**
   * *Smooth surfaces that don't trap food*
   * *Material that doesn't stain easily*
   * *Quick-drying properties*

# The Great Materials Showdown üèÜ

# 1. Melamine: The Reliable Friend

My experience: I've been using the same melamine set for 3 years now, including a memorable 2-week trip through Yellowstone. It's survived countless drops, dishwasher cycles, and even an encounter with a curious raccoon!

**Pros:**

* Practically unbreakable
* Lightweight
* Dishwasher safe
* Affordable
* Comes in fun designs

**Cons:**

* Can retain food odors over time
* Not microwave safe
* May not be ideal for very hot foods

# 2. Stainless Steel: The Immortal Warrior

True story: My stainless steel plate survived being accidentally run over by a Jeep at our campsite. It got a small dent that I now consider a badge of honor!

**Pros:**

* Nearly indestructible
* Perfect for cooking and eating
* Will outlive you
* Easy to clean
* Doesn't retain flavors

**Cons:**

* Can be heavy
* Conducts heat (learned this the hard way with soup!)
* Can be noisy in your pack
* More expensive

# 3. Enamelware: The Vintage Beauty

A lesson learned: During a mountain camping trip, my enamel mug got its first chip from a small drop. By the end of the season, that chip had grown into a significant crack. However, I still love it for car camping!

**Pros:**

* Classic outdoor aesthetic
* Good heat retention
* Relatively lightweight
* Easy to clean

**Cons:**

* Can chip and crack
* Chips can rust
* More expensive than plastic options
* Not ideal for backpacking

# 4. Bamboo: The Eco-Warrior

My sustainable camping phase taught me a lot about bamboo dinnerware. Used it exclusively for a summer of weekend camping trips.

**Pros:**

* Environmentally friendly
* Naturally antibacterial
* Very lightweight
* Beautiful aesthetic

**Cons:**

* Less durable than synthetic options
* Can absorb flavors
* Needs more careful cleaning
* May crack in extreme temperatures

# 5. Bioplastics: The Modern Marvel

Recent addition to my gear collection - perfect for ultralight adventures!

**Pros:**

* Extremely lightweight
* Environmentally conscious
* Affordable
* Good for cold to warm foods

**Cons:**

* Not as durable as traditional materials
* Can warp with very hot foods
* May need replacement more often
* Limited style options

# Comprehensive Comparison Table üìä

|Material|Durability|Weight|Heat Resistance|Cost|Eco-Friendly|Lifespan|Best Use|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Melamine|4/5|3/5|3/5|2/5|2/5|3-5 years|Car Camping|
|Stainless Steel|5/5|4/5|5/5|4/5|4/5|10+ years|All-Purpose|
|Enamelware|3/5|3/5|4/5|4/5|3/5|2-4 years|Glamping|
|Bamboo|2/5|2/5|2/5|3/5|5/5|1-2 years|Light Use|
|Bioplastics|3/5|1/5|2/5|2/5|4/5|1-2 years|Ultralight|

# Real-World Testing: My Personal Experiences üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

# The Mountain Test

Took all five materials on a challenging 3-day mountain trek. Here's how they performed:

1. **Stainless Steel**: Champion of hot meals, but added noticeable weight
2. **Melamine**: Perfect for cold meals, struggled with boiling water
3. **Enamelware**: One plate chipped on day two
4. **Bamboo**: Performed well but absorbed some curry flavor
5. **Bioplastics**: Ultralight winner but showed some wear

# The Family Camping Test

Used different sets during a week-long family camping trip:

1. **Melamine**: Perfect for kids
2. **Stainless Steel**: Great for cooking and serving
3. **Enamelware**: Adults loved the aesthetic
4. **Bamboo**: Great for salads and cold foods
5. **Bioplastics**: Good backup option

# Pro Tips for Dinnerware Success üéØ

# 1. Storage Solutions

* Use cloth napkins between plates to prevent scratching
* Store in dedicated bags with padding
* Keep away from heavy gear

# 2. Cleaning in the Wild

* Bring biodegradable soap
* Use sand as a natural scrubber
* Heat water for tough stains
* Always dry completely before storing

# 3. Mixed Material Strategy

I've found the perfect combination is:

* *Stainless steel* for cooking and hot foods
* *Melamine* for general use
* *Bioplastics* for ultralight backup

# Specific Use Cases and Recommendations üé™

# For Car Camping

* **Best Choice**: Melamine sets
* **Runner Up**: Enamelware
* **Why**: Durability without weight concerns

# For Backpacking

* **Best Choice**: Titanium or Bioplastics
* **Runner Up**: Stainless Steel
* **Why**: Weight is crucial

# For Family Camping

* **Best Choice**: Mixed Melamine and Stainless Steel
* **Runner Up**: Enamelware
* **Why**: Durability and safety for kids

# Maintenance Tips for Longevity üßº

# Daily Cleaning

1. Scrape off food residue
2. Use biodegradable soap
3. Rinse thoroughly
4. Dry completely

# Deep Cleaning at Home

1. Vinegar solution soak
2. Baking soda scrub for tough stains
3. Thorough sanitization
4. Complete air drying

# Environmental Considerations üå±

# Impact Reduction

* Choose durable options to reduce waste
* Opt for biodegradable cleaning products
* Consider end-of-life disposal
* Repair when possible

# Final Thoughts üí≠

After countless meals in the wilderness, I've learned that the perfect camping dinnerware depends entirely on your specific needs. Don't be afraid to mix and match materials, and always test new gear before heading out on a major trip.

# My Personal Setup

* **Weekend Trips**: Melamine set with stainless steel cooking pieces
* **Backpacking**: Titanium pot and bioplastic plate
* **Family Camping**: Full melamine set with enamel mugs for coffee

Coffee - specialty, fair trade, farming, roasting,... everything from bean to brew are big interests of mine as a blogger and world traveler. My hobby primarily consists of spending a day in a coffee shop working on my computer, playing board games/cards, reading, or just chatting with and learning about the owners/team members... which is how I spend my travels as well! 

With this all said, I am looking for coffee shop recommendations in Orange County - within 20-30 minutes driving from Yorba Linda, preferably. Wifi, indoor seating, and oat milk are musts. :) High-top, community, or bar seating preferred (I am a stander!).

I‚Äôm the type who would savor an afternoon at the park with a book or a picnic.

This is a command line history manager built with SwiftUI to help users interact with history more conveniently. Like my other macOS apps, it's still **open-source** and **free**.

**xHistory** is lightweight and non-intrusive, you can even use it like a native feature. But it's more than that, I added a lot of useful features to it, including:

* Get history in real time (works with bash and zsh now)
* Customizable highlighting scheme based on syntax tree analysis.
* Supports searching / pinning / filtering / copying and filling your history.
* ""Magic Slice"" can help you quickly copy a fragment of any history.
* ""AutoFill"" allows you to enter text into the command line without having to copy it.
* Can be invoked in a variety of ways: hotkeys, command, menu bar, etc.
* No user data will be uploaded to any server, it runs completely offline!

**This is my fourth open source macOS app and thank you for your support, I love you all!**

1golzbp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1golzbp/it_seems_that_everything_is_perfect_there_is_only/,It seems that everything is perfect. There is only the Good Ending.,"The cleverness of the story of mankind and God is that everyone will get what they want in the end.

You are either with God or without God and you are either with God because you want to be or you are without God because you want to be.

If all salvation takes is repentance, then all who humble themselves in their final moments shall receive forgiveness and all who do not, who are too attached to their worldly priorities, will not be forced to rise up to a state they do not want.

In that way, everyone gets their own good ending. Those who are righteous shall live on in bliss forever with God and those who are not shall know true death and be freed from the pain of their sin, gone forever. Obliterated from all existence.

It's kinda weird but God sure is weird. A final act of compassion even unto those who reject Him, to obliterate them.

Now, sometimes I wonder which side I'm on because sometimes I feel life on Earth is enough and eternal death is just the rest I need. Either way, it's just perfect. But for the sake of the challenge, I think it's worth trying to be with God, even if I'll be alone.

Everything I love in this world, I trust I will not have in the Kingdom of the Father. There, I will have no cigarettes or coffee. I will have no guitars to play nor fabrics to sew for fun with. I will have no friends or family for I know them well and I know the wages of their deeds. Hypothetically, it would just be myself, some kind strangers, and the Almighty Father and his Son. 

But then, maybe it's not about what I want. No, it never was. It's about what's right.

My family has been secular for many years now. The last of our faithful died five years ago. It was my grandmother. She died smiling up at a hospital ceiling with a look of utter tranquility. It shook my mother to her core, watching as her mother took on that expression and then just... died. She called for help and the doctors rushed in to give her CPR. They kept at it till all her ribs were broken. She was gone and still, she had that look of peace on her face, according to my mother. A look of peace more serene than all her nights of sleep before, for in life she'd been wracked with terrible pains.

Sometimes, I think maybe she'd seen the future. Maybe upon death, we immediately time travel to the Day of Judgement and somehow, somehow I just get this self-centric feeling that my grandmother was smiling because she saw me there too, and in that way, I feel I'd like nowhere else to go than be with her. At least her. When she was alive, I was still a heathen, but now that she's gone, it's just as she always told me.

""When I'm gone, you will know I was right.""

If you've made it this far, thank you. If you please, pray for me. Call me a stray dog for I am not under the roof of the Lord but when he comes, I shall throw myself in front of Him and beg for scraps.",1,1731306770.0,Christianity,8,1.0,False

Final stop in my 18 day Italy trip with my parents, after visiting Venice, Bologna, Ravenna, Florence, and Sienna. 

Day 1:

Walked from Termini to our airbnb right in Centro near Piazza Navona. This is definitely the place to stay for a first timer, everything we wanted to see was within a 30min walk. 

Walked over to Trastevere, suppli was amazing at Suppli Roma, saw a short lineup for Da Enzo and joined the line. Dinner was great, amatricina carbonara and oxtail. Stumbled upon the Chiesa di Sant (amazing ceiling fresco). 

Day 2: 

Booked Pantheon ticket the night before for 9am opening. After almost two weeks, using that website was the first time my card issuer (wealthsimple) decided to put a hold on my card post- transaction. Quick call and it was sorted. 

Short lineup outside at opening, not too crowded inside. Could have skipped the online payment if i showed up later. 

Sant'Agnese in Agone was also beautiful on the inside. Walked to Trevi Fountain, its ok, and then walked to Spanish steps and into villa borghese. Loved all the green space here and wandered for a while. Lunch at Al 34, loved the orrichette here, but also the only time we ordered that. Chilled out at Monumento a Vittorio Emanuele for sunset. Dinner at Roscioli Salumeria con Cucina, which was good, but not sure I need to go back when there are so many other options. One of the pastas seemed less than al dente.

Day 3:
Vatican day. I had prebooked the 830am entry. Got there by 8am and lineup was already big. Wow this museum was overwhelming big, used the Rick steves guide which covered the highlights. Sistine chapel was crowded as expected, but found a good seat and spent 30 minutes marvelling at it all. Didnt try to use the right door to St Peters, seemed like it was for groups only, could have feigned ignorance? 

Walked around the outside, had lunch, lineup for St Peters was halfway around but was only 30min in the end. Dinner at Emma, good pizza but favourite was the cacio e pepe which I enjoyed better than night before. 

Day 4:
Got lucky and booked the 8:50am attic ticket. I was so confused by which ticket and how to book thesez so thanks to this sub for the help (tip, use the search function). What a special experience to be up there with just a few other ppl. Lunch at RUVER Teglia Frazionata, which was my favourite pizza al tagio. Spent afternoon in the Forum, walked into all the SUPER sites. Palatine hills and Forum were overwhelming tbh, wished we had more time here, and in hindsight would have come here the next day since the ticket is valid for two days, one entry. Dinner at Dar Poeta, solid pizza. 

Day 5:
Final day. Nothing planned at all. Started with a sunrise run pass the pantheon, colosseo, the pyramid, along the Tiber, the vatican, piazza del popolo. Turns out there was a 15k race later that morning, should have signed up for it. Had a porchetta at Panino Ingegnoso, 2nd best of the trip, best was in Sienna. 

Stumbled into the Campagna Amica Market. Packed with locals. Bought some pecorino cheese to take home, ate some fritta for lunch. Walked over to Largo di Torre Argentina, grabbed a slice from Alice since everyone else was eating it. Great pizza al tagio. Had the bufala pistachio gelato at Ruma Bottega, which was up there with the best of the trip. Dinner at Maritozzo Rosso, which was my favorite pasta out of places we tried here. Suppli, alicia, maritozzo, carbonara and cacio e pepe. They specialize in savoury maritozzos, but the pastas were my fav. Good last meal. Picked up some more pizza at Antico Forno Roscioli for the flight home. 

Day 6:
7am flight from FCO, booked at 4am taxi with Freenow day before. First taxi ride of the trip. Went smooth, pickup confirmed minutes after booking, driver arrived on time, cost 58euro with the extra service charge. Coffee and cornetto at the Eataly while we waited for our flight with lots of time (bag check and security was fast, <30min). Best airport cafes I've been to. 

Overall, great first trip to Italy, sticking to the standard tourist sites with my parents. Ill be back for sure to explore more of the natural beauty of Italy, dolomites and the Valle d'Aosta in particular, and the south. 

would try to learn some more italian next time, but a couple weeks of Duolingo definitely helped with basics. Everywhere we went felt very safe, arguably safer than home. I'll miss the plentiful cafes, trattorias and beautiful artwork everywhere. Thanks for the reccos everyone!

Chapter 1:

In the peculiar and mysterious realm of Vectoid found at https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/670754400/fullscreen/, the landscape is dominated by strange black skies illuminated only by faint light filtering through vents leading down to the acidic core of the world. Initially presided over by the Grand Builders, who initiated the ambitious construction of towering structures, the empire thrived in abundance for roughly a century. During this period of prosperity lasting around 100 years, the Grand Builders fashioned numerous monumental edifices across their vast dominion. Following this golden era and the subsequent 500 years of modest wealth and societal well-being, the empire eventually crumbled, dissolving into oblivion. In its wake emerged the Vectoids, a newfound civilization gradually seizing control of the land coveted by their predecessors. Amidst the upheaval, a handful of refugees from the era of the Grand Builders managed to endure, bearing witness to the turbulent transition of power across the enigmatic world of Vectoid.



The most important of which was called ‚ÄúScratcher.‚Äù He was little known during the prior 10 years before the empire‚Äôs vanishing. After he went and built a little hut, he constructed it to be a unique sanctuary amid the rugged landscape. The hut, standing at a height of around 7 feet, was meticulously crafted from dark oak wood, imparting a sense of rustic elegance. Its strategic location near an acid vent leading to the core's inner lair bestowed upon him a mix of peril and comfort - the vent providing an unconventional source of Stage 2 Lung cancer, yet radiating a welcoming glow and warmth. The floor, fashioned from a sleek, cold blue stone favored by the empire for its durability, offered a stark contrast to the warm wooden walls.



A single circular window, 2 feet in diameter, framed the hut, allowing glimpses of the surrounding terrain. The dimensions of the hut, measuring 8 feet deep and 10 feet wide, provided ample space for his modest belongings. A small cabinet adorned with the remnants of jewelry salvaged from his previous home added a touch of nostalgia. Memories of The Attacks lingered, but he chose to bury them deep, leaving only traces in the corners of his mind.



His simple bed, elevated slightly from the ground on a mat, served as a meager defense against the encroachment of rodents. Despite his efforts, the occasional rat could still breach his sleeping quarters, provided they were not unusually diminutive in size. Amidst his possessions, Scratcher unearthed copies of ""Tower Building One"" and its sequel, fueling his ambition to construct formidable turret towers. Plans took shape for towers named ""Bullet"" and ""Laser,"" intended for both sustenance hunting and defensive strategies against potential threats.



As he envisioned his future within the confines of his hut, the world outside held both danger and opportunity, echoing the dichotomy of his existence since The Attacks had reshaped his life. Through resilience and ingenuity, Scratcher sought to carve out a new sense of security within the walls of his modest abode, mindful of the challenges that lay ahead yet determined to thrive in the face of adversity.



Scratcher, a skilled resource extractor, embarked on the monumental task of gathering valuable materials from the depths of the https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/670754400/fullscreen/. Armed with a meticulously crafted pickaxe of his own making, the tool shimmered with a mesmerizing hue - a mesmerizing blend of blue in darkness and green under the light. The pickaxe, a treasured heirloom forged by his legendary great grandfather Sla'thor in the depths of the grandest forge, bore the weight of a lineage marked by craftsmanship and resilience. This forge, with its sprawling pathways leading to individual workstations, served as a sacred ground where skilled artisans like Scratcher could fashion essential tools like pickaxes and tower components.



Contemplating his next move, Scratcher realized the need to establish an acid forge in order to create the intricate tower parts required for his endeavor. As he gripped the pickaxe, its handle seamlessly molded to fit his unique grip style and strength, an extension of his own being. The length of the handle, perfectly harmonizing with his arm's proportions, imbued him with a sense of connection to the ancestral wisdom encapsulated within the tool.



With unwavering determination, Scratcher bore into the nearby bluestone wall, feeling the raw power of his body and pickaxe as they cut through the solid rock with precision and ease. Each strike resonated with a controlled force akin to a martial artist's focused strike - reminiscent of the disciplined precision seen in a proficient practitioner of a martial art requiring years of training and dedication, though unknown in his world. As he delved deeper into the stone, a symphony of echoes reverberated through the chamber, a testament to his skill and determination in the face of adversity.



After around two and a half hours of mining, he hit a fresh Solidified Acid Pocket, these were quite common and with just a bit of prolonged air exposure it would start turning into normal acid, which could be used to forge objects in a forge that utilizes acid to forge objects. After he extracted the acid with gloved hands, white gloves of course, he placed it in a stone cauldron he had recovered, it would work for the low level forging required to make tower parts.

Scratcher got to work reading the manuals, cross referencing them to find out what the pages said, or what pages were missing and what they said, he wrote them down onto another piece of paper, then bound it up at the end with it attached to a hard cover Whitestone cover, whitestone is a very strong resource that reflects heat and fire, along with surviving in acid for up to 30 minutes and 35 seconds. He made it so it could be sealed in an airtight case so if he had to leave it it would stay safe. He made another copy with the same whitestone cover to bury around 5 foot 3 inches under the ground under his middle of his house.

After a day he slept, sleeping well for around eight hours and 32 minutes, 53 seconds before entering a state of consciousness, his dreams vibrating around in his head, they were showing him the seconds before destruction of his home, his town, his family, his country, his empire‚Ä¶

Upon awakening he missed his coffee, he had a custom made coffee pot, labeled with the word ‚ÄúScratcher‚Äù in gold, forged by his normal grandfather, it brewed his coffee to an amazing taste and caffeine count, he had a headache but knew he had to get back to work, he started building a true forge, with hard borders and a huge acid pit, he needed to start tower parts.

The day was pleasant when he first walked outside, only 4 average sized cloud looking clouds in the sky floating around, no unexpected acid clouds visible, acid clouds wouldn‚Äôt kill you, but you might be burned for weeks, and any miners were at huge risk if they couldn‚Äôt get away from it.

The temperature was 68 degrees fahrenheit, they had no concept of fahrenheit, so they wouldn‚Äôt understand this assessment, sadly. Scratcher felt good today, on his way to get mining, and if you saw him you would see he was better than yesterday, even with the screams of death echoing in his ears. He began mining and digging, needing iron and copper for his tower components, along with hoping for a Vectrium deposit to make his Laser towers more powerful.

He came up to the surface after five hours and thirty two minutes and thirty two seconds, with a large amount of materials packed over his back, the backpack was forged by his other great grandfather and was given to him for his sixteenth birthday, however Scratcher never much liked going outside, he preferred to run a business selling low tier graphics cards to his classmates for cheap prices, compared to the price of the other Vectrex 320 and Vectax 460, the other low end graphics cards coming out, at least before the empire died.

‚ÄúAfter I make some defenses, I will make a computer and see if anybody else lives.‚Äù Scratcher thought illogically. He had forgotten the fact the WiFi would be down, even if he could remember how to make a working wifi chip.

Scratcher got to work on forging a silicon chip in his acid forge, he first needed to make a cast using intense microscopically focused heat, he started digging an alcove into the bluestone that he would put his forge in, and then build a mini factory inside around his forge in the hole for the forge. The digging took awhile, a while indeed, in fact, some might say the while was a long while, but in the grand scheme of the universe, the while was but a blink of an eye, a grain of sand on the eternity that is the universe. Of course, Scratcher had no concept of sand, or beaches like we know them, only knowledge of where the pure acid was, slowly eating away at the [https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/670754400/fullscreen/](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/670754400/fullscreen/) (for reference, every time [https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/670754400/fullscreen/](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/670754400/fullscreen/) is put down, it means the world).

And the [https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/670754400/fullscreen/](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/670754400/fullscreen/) had no such thing as sand anyways, as nothing lived in the grand acid lakes of the [https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/670754400/fullscreen/](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/670754400/fullscreen/) meaning that nothing could create enough sand to matter, nor in the grand oceans of the [https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/670754400/fullscreen/](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/670754400/fullscreen/) so no sand their either, sadly for them for they could never experience the pleasure of sitting on the sand near a large body of water, for all the water in their [https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/670754400/fullscreen/](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/670754400/fullscreen/) was buried deep under the ground.

After digging for a while, Scratcher took a drink of water that he had saved from his well earlier, and collapsed onto the cold bluestone ground of the cavern he was creating for his forge, where he would build a factory around, in time he would.

Upon awakening, Scratcher was hungry, he went out of the cavern he was digging out from the bluestone to fit his forge where he would build a factory around in time. He went outside onto the coldness of the [https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/670754400/fullscreen/](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/670754400/fullscreen/) , looking out he felt a sense of sorrow, for he knew his [https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/670754400/fullscreen/](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/670754400/fullscreen/) was never going to be the same again. And this made him rather sad, as how would you feel if your whole [https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/670754400/fullscreen/](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/670754400/fullscreen/) was changed and could never be the same again? You would probably be sad as well, just as Scratcher was, as he thought about how his [https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/670754400/fullscreen/](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/670754400/fullscreen/) was never going to be the same again. He thought of how he no longer had the convenience of being able to go to the store to buy food, or having materials ready, for the [https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/670754400/fullscreen/](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/670754400/fullscreen/) was changed, and him with it, as he was rather sad about the whole situation of his life at the present moment, thinking about how sad he was about being sad made him realize that there was a long speckled rabbit in front of him.

Long speckled rabbits are long rabbits, with dots all over, this one was a creamy white brown mixture, looking delectable, Scratcher was hungry, so he bonked the rabbit on the head with his pickaxe forged by his great grandfather and roasted the rabbit over the heat of the acid forge he had made prior to the moment the rabbit was bonked, prior to that day as well.

The rabbit took awhile to cook over the aforementioned acid forge for forging stuff, or for now cooking things, as the rabbit cooked Scratcher thought about his own sorry self, feeling sorry for himself the whole time, as why would he not? The situation was quite tragic and different from what he had known before, and he was glad he finally started working out.

Scratcher was just out of youth, and had decided to get in shape just three months, twenty six days, and three hours before the attack, luckily he worked hard, or he probably would not have even survived to this point, meaning he was rather lucky to have started working out then, or he would not even be thinking about how lucky he was right now that he had started working out then.The rabbit finally cooked after cooking over the aforementioned acid forge for forging stuff and now cooking, for several hours, leading to Scratcher FINALLY eating and using the skin to make a small blanket, not even enough to keep him truly warm during the cold nights of the world.



Scratcher thought about how he would write his own story in his own words.

As he recalled the vivid memories of his exhilarating journey, an idea began to form in his mind - the idea of penning down a book that would encapsulate every moment, every emotion, and every detail of this extraordinary adventure. It played on his thoughts persistently, stirring a sense of purpose within him. Each day, as he settled into the tranquility of normal life, the urge to embark on this literary endeavor intensified. The prospect of immortalizing the enthralling escapade through ink on paper filled him with a sense of excitement and anticipation. It seemed like the perfect project to channel his creativity and share his experiences with the world.



He envisaged a narrative that would not only entertain but also inspire others to dare greatly, to embrace the unknown with courage and curiosity. The thought that his words could spark a similar sense of wanderlust or ignite a passion for exploration in someone else's heart fueled his determination.



For him, this concept of capturing the essence of his adventures in a book transformed from a mere idea to a calling, a mission to preserve the essence of his journey for posterity. The belief that this story deserved to be more than just a fleeting memory pushed him to consider the inherent value of crafting a literary masterpiece that would stand the test of time.



With each passing day, the clarity of his vision sharpened, and the excitement to embark on this literary odyssey grew. The more he ruminated on the intricacies of storytelling and the power of words to transport readers to far-off lands, the more convinced he became that this endeavor was not just a good idea but a necessary one.



In the tapestry of his mind, the threads of creativity, determination, and passion intertwined, weaving the fabric of his future book. It was a project that held the promise of not just recounting an adventure but also encapsulating the spirit of exploration and the boundless possibilities that lie beyond the confines of the familiar.



So, with a renewed sense of purpose and a heart brimming with enthusiasm, he embarked on the journey of a lifetime - the journey of transforming his memories into a literary magnum opus that would stand as a testament to the transformative power of storytelling.

Once Scratcher had finished pondering all these intricate details, he eagerly returned to the laborious task at hand - digging tirelessly into the resilient bluestone surface. His primary objective was to carve out a space within which the acid forge would be situated. With unwavering determination, he envisioned this forge as the cornerstone for his ambitious project - a factory to be established for the precise purpose of fabricating the essential components needed to construct his towering fortress. These components were not merely for structural integrity but also for fortification against potential threats, serving to safeguard both his territory and sustenance sources from aerial invaders. In pursuit of this grand endeavor, Scratcher delved deep into the rugged terrain, each shovel of earth another step towards realizing his vision of a stronghold that would stand as a testament to his skill, resilience, and strategic foresight.



He finally gave up working on the cavern for his forge, a vast underground sanctuary he had meticulously carved out of the earth, to create his factory in. It was late into the night when he decided to call it quits, feeling the exhaustion creeping into his bones as he gathered his tools and made his way towards the surface. The flickering torchlight cast ghostly shadows on the rough-hewn walls, a stark contrast to the industrial vision he had in mind for his planned factory.



As he trudged wearily to his sleeping quarters, he wrapped himself in the warmth of his self-made rabbit skin blanket, finding solace in its familiar touch. The night air was cool against his skin, carrying faint whispers of the impending dawn. Tiredness weighed heavily on his eyelids, lulling him into a state of drowsiness that beckoned him towards the embrace of sleep.



In his dreams, the images of his town flashed before his closed eyes, vivid memories intermingling with the haunting specter of the Vectoids. Those monstrous beings, with their mechanical limbs and insatiable hunger for destruction, had brought ruin upon his once-thriving community. Scratcher's heart clenched with sorrow and anger as he relived the chaos and devastation wrought by those otherworldly invaders. Yet, amidst the turmoil of his nightmares, a flicker of determination ignited within him, propelling him towards a singular purpose - to rebuild and reclaim what had been lost.

In the early hours of the day, Scratcher woke up feeling a sense of fatigue engulfing his entire being. Alongside this weariness, he became acutely aware that his hand, the very instrument of his detailed expression, was also weary, strained from the elaborate writing it had meticulously carried out. Thus, he made a conscious decision to moderate the depth of his descriptions, reserving intricate depictions only for moments of profound inspiration that stirred his creative spirit. Contemplating this adjustment in his writing approach led him to ponder the purpose of the fourth wall - that invisible barrier separating creator and audience - and whether its boundaries were meant to be transgressed. After all, what significance did the fourth wall hold if not to challenge conventions and invite a daring breach of the norm? It was in these reflective moments that Scratcher found himself considering the delicate balance between immersion and detachment in storytelling, and how breaking the fourth wall could potentially redefine the interactive dynamics between the storyteller and the one being told. As he mulled over these thoughts, a spark of curiosity ignited within him, prompting a newfound exploration of narrative possibilities that transcended the confines of traditional storytelling structures. The notion of breaking the fourth wall took on a deeper significance, hinting at a potential shift in his creative process that could usher in a fresh wave of innovation and engagement with his craft.

‚ÄúI need some new life considerations omg‚Äù Thought Scratcher, using internet slang intermingled with his thoughts.

Scratcher walked over to the place he was going to make his factory, he had to dig more, but he was finally done digging. He delved into his workbench, meticulously selecting the materials needed to fashion intricate casts for the minuscule components of his defense tower. With meticulous attention to detail, he embarked on his journey to bring to life a groundbreaking ""Laser"" tower, the first of its kind, designed to sweep the skies with precision and strike down any airborne threats, even the elusive birds that dared encroach upon his territory. Yet, beyond the realm of mere avian adversaries, his creation held a deeper purpose ‚Äì a shield against the formidable Vectoids, the merciless forces that had inflicted unspeakable harm upon his world, driving him to the edge of despair. As he toiled tirelessly in his workshop, each piece falling into place with unyielding determination, he forged not just a tower of defense, but a symbol of resilience and defiance against the shadows of his past. Through the humming of machinery and the flurry of activity, a new hope emerged, wrapped in the embrace of cutting-edge technology and unwavering resolve.

As he stood there, observing in amazement, the tower he had painstakingly built successfully aimed and shot down the first bird that had come his way. Emotions of pride and accomplishment surged through him, filling his chest with the satisfaction of a lone achievement. He couldn't help but revel in the solitary triumph, knowing that many others had typically relied on teamwork, group efforts, or assistance from external sources to achieve a similar feat. In that solitary moment of victory, he felt a sense of independence and strength, proving to himself that he was capable of achieving remarkable things on his own. The pride that swelled within him served as a testament to his dedication, perseverance, and skill, solidifying his belief in his own capabilities and fortitude. Though the task had been challenging and demanding, the outcome was more than worth the effort expended, as it symbolized not just the act of shooting down a bird, but a personal milestone of surpassing limitations and achieving greatness through individual effort and determination.

Scratcher, whose hand-built house was now a refuge in the desolation caused by the invasion of the Vectoids, sat down in the quiet solitude, his mind heavy with the burden of processing the catastrophic events that had unfolded before his eyes. He pondered over the ruins of what was once his cherished town, memories of his friends and family flashing through his thoughts like fragments of a shattered mirror. The image of the menacing triangular Vectoids, swift in their approach and deadly in their precision, lingered ominously in his mind, a reminder of the relentless destruction that had befallen everything he held dear.



As he delved deeper into his memories, he grappled with the stark contrast between reality and the haunting echoes of his imagination. The vivid recollection of the orange spherical basics, those seemingly harmless yet insidious beings, haunted his thoughts. These slow-moving orbs, with their deceptively gentle approach, represented a constant threat that lurked in the shadows, ready to pounce upon any unsuspecting prey. The fear of their touch, and the knowledge of the devastation it would bring, sent shivers down Scratcher's spine.



In the midst of his reflections, a poignant recollection surfaced from the depths of his mind, a memory that he tried to suppress but found impossible to ignore. The haunting image of his beloved mother, her face etched with a mix of courage and despair, flashed before his eyes. The last time he saw her, surrounded by chaos and destruction, her presence was a beacon of strength in a world consumed by darkness.



As the weight of his grief and loss settled upon him, Scratcher found himself at a crossroads, unsure of what path to take next. The ruins around him bore witness to the devastation wrought by the Vectoids, but they also whispered tales of resilience and hope. With determination etched into his features, Scratcher made a silent vow to honor the memory of those he had lost, to rise from the ashes of destruction.

As Scratcher dove deeper into the profound realization that facing the Vectoids head-on was the pivotal step needed to restore his inner calm and equilibrium, he found himself unable to shake off the looming specter of the upcoming trials that loomed large on the horizon, casting a dark, foreboding shadow over his already heavily burdened mind. The very act of seizing back control over the neighboring states of the once-great empire presented itself as a colossal challenge, an immense undertaking fraught with unknowns and formidable adversaries standing in the way. The outlook of stabilizing these newly acquired territories post-conquest appeared even more daunting, sparking uncertainties regarding the sustainability of his reign amidst the potential waves of unrest and rebellion that threatened to erode his authority. Fully cognizant of the immense weight of responsibility resting squarely on his shoulders, Scratcher decisively resolved to actively search for allies, understanding that successful collaboration was crucial in navigating the imminent battles that lay ahead. The pressing imperative of building a robust coalition took center stage, necessitating strategic partnerships with any survivors left to form a united front against the imminent threat posed by the relentless march of the Vectoids. Recognizing the importance of readying his comrades for the arduous trials looming on the horizon, Scratcher devoted himself to imparting crucial knowledge on harnessing the power of his acid forge to construct defensive towers capable of withstanding the ferocious assaults of the enemy hordes. The process of instructing his companions in the intricate art of tower construction became a top priority, demanding painstaking attention to detail and rigorous training to ensure their adeptness in crafting these indispensable defenses. Although Scratcher's current proficiency was confined to crafting ""Bullet"" and ""Laser"" towers, his resolve to uncover the missing blueprints and broaden his repertoire of defensive structures remained steadfast and resolute. The quest for additional instructional manuals evolved into a pivotal mission, one that promised to equip his defenders with a diverse array of armaments capable of thwarting the varied strategies employed by the cunning Vectoids in their ceaseless onslaughts. Scratcher's unyielding dedication to expanding his knowledge base and meticulously planning his strategies stood as the cornerstone of his preparations, brilliantly laying the groundwork for a sturdy resistance that would bravely stand against the unforgiving forces threatening the very last remnants of the empire.



Before embarking on his journey to the Diode Forest, a sprawling expanse comprising 8 of the 24 states within the empire, Scratcher meticulously plotted his course. Initially, his quest would revolve around reclaiming the elusive Dream Road, a meandering path that meandered through the terrain, twisting northward, then veering sideways before curving back south, only to swerve sideways once more, leading him into a different state altogether. By wrestling back control of Dream Road, Scratcher aimed to disrupt a crucial conduit in the empire's transportation network, effectively hobbling the Vectoids, the malevolent force behind the devastation, by limiting their mobility and resources.



With Dream Road secured, Scratcher's strategy would then pivot towards launching a systematic expansion from this pivotal stronghold, systematically reclaiming the remaining states under the oppressive grip of the Vectoids. Amidst the ruins, he sought to locate any resilient survivors who had weathered the cataclysm, offering them hope and a beacon of defiance against the encroaching darkness. Moreover, buried within the vestiges of the fallen civilization, lay the elusive lost manuals‚Äîguiding blueprints essential for the construction of formidable towers, potent weapons that could tip the scales in their favor. Scratcher's ambition extended far beyond mere reclamation; it ventured into the realm of redemption and resurgence, breathing life back into the shattered remnants of the empire.

Scratcher spent hours meticulously preparing various tower components in anticipation of transporting them using a sturdy pull-wagon that he had specially equipped for this task. The isolated region of Dream Road served as a stark boundary, effectively severing the Diode Forest from the diminishing remnants of what once constituted the empire. This strategic separation meant that any rebellious activities within the forest would likely go unnoticed, as the attention of the Vectoids was primarily directed towards the capital city and the critical acid network that supplied essential power and warmth to all its territories.



With a steely determination, Scratcher set his sights on reclaiming Dream Road from the malevolent Vectoids who had entrenched themselves there. Despite their formidable presence, he knew that the primary adversaries he would encounter were the swift Triangular Speedies, distinguished by their vibrant yellow forms, and the unassuming spherical Basics, whose peculiar orange bodies had inflicted an irreparable loss on him by taking his mother's life. Additionally, he remained wary of the Triangular red Regenerators, known for their regenerative capabilities, as well as the elusive airborne red squarish Flyings, a rare but formidable opponent in their own right. Emboldened by his resolve and armed with the memory of his past grievances, Scratcher steeled himself for the challenging encounters that lay ahead on his quest to rid Dream Road of its oppressive occupants and begin restoring his empire back to its former glory.

Scratcher, a brave adventurer determined to reclaim the now darkened land from the clutches of the Vectoids, embarked on a perilous journey through the eerie graystone hills that once thrived with the vibrant glow of the capital's light, a beacon now extinguished due to The Attacks. In the dark and foreboding realm where shadows danced eerily across the landscape, the sinister Vectoids lurked with an air of malevolence. These otherworldly beings, with their bodies shrouded in inky darkness, despised any hint of light, which only served to reveal the cold metallic glint of their robotic forms. As they moved noiselessly through the void, their slender, mechanical appendages glinted faintly with the reflection of their glowing viewing cameras, the sole hint of their unsettling presence. It was through these cameras that they observed, unblinking and detached, the world around them, their red, unfeeling eyes capturing every detail in the dimly lit surroundings. It was this subtle luminosity, a stark contrast to the pervasive darkness that cloaked their existence, that marked the Vectoids' silent intrusion into the shadows, a chilling reminder of the malevolent forces at play in the realm of obscurity and mystery. With only his trusty lamp guiding his path and the occasional eerie glow of the acid pits rising from the planet's core to illuminate his way, Scratcher pressed on with unwavering resolve towards the looming Diode Forest. His mission clear in his mind, he knew that the key to the beginnings expelling the Vectoids lay within the heart of the forest, and time was of the essence. Every step he took, every shadow he passed, brought him closer to the confrontation that would determine the fate of the land and its inhabitants. As he trudged through the darkened terrain, the weight of responsibility heavy on his shoulders, Scratcher was driven not only by a desire to rid the land of the oppressive Vectoids but also by the hope of restoring the once vibrant and prosperous world to its former glory.

1golvep,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1golvep/about_the_generator_room_by_pizza_hut_and_bp_on/,ABOUT THE GENERATOR ROOM BY PIZZA HUT AND BP ON Copley Rd. ,"You all have seen it if you lived in Akron. That brick building by the highway right next to pizza hut on Copley road. It's right next to a BP gas station too, yea that building. Now that you know what I'm talking about let me begin my story. I worked for the city as a maintenance man for these generator rooms back when I was 22. There is a total of 6. I have to go to each one for 1 hour to do maintenance and pretty much make sure everything is working properly. My first generator room is the one by Copley road. When I first started I was introduced to a man named Paul. Paul was a white man in his mid 40s of average height, with a not so average size body. (He was about 350 lbs). He showed me what the job entails and about all the rules and regulations. All of which sounded normal. If you're going to call off do it at least 1 hour before your shift. If you need time off go online to the website and of course no sleeping on the job because it can get boring from time to time. One particular rule stood out to me though. Never come back to this location until the next day. I asked Paul why and he told me for security purposes. This made sense to me so I never bothered asking about it again. On my first day I stopped at BP for a coffee to wake myself up. I chatted it up with this cashier named Anthony. Told him I just started working a minute walk away and that he'd be seeing me more often. And with that I headed to building number 1. I went in and checked all the monitors. After seeing everything was good I sat down and scrolled through my phone. The hour went by rather quickly, before I knew it I was on my way to the next building. I repeated this process until my shift was over at 6pm. Every Monday-Friday I'd repeat the same thing. Go in to get a coffee or Iced tea, head to building number 1 and go on to the others. For the most part everything was uneventful until my 5th month in. 

    It was on a Monday, I went into BP to get my coffee and chat it up with Anthony. I routinely headed to building number 1 to see Paul rushing out and slamming the door shut behind him. We both stared at each other for 10 seconds until I asked him if everything was ok to go inside. He stood there for 5 seconds and finally said yea of course. Paul then hobbled off to his truck and sped onto the highway. I was so confused that I forgot it was almost time to clock in. I opened the door to see nothing out of place. As of to why Paul acted that way was beyond me. I just checked all of the monitors and sat down to scroll through Facebook. The rest of the day went on like normal. On Tuesday I headed into Bp, Anthony wasn't there, so I figured the guy must be sick. It was until Friday I noticed he wasn't there for the past several days. I asked the cashier that day that always worked behind Anthony about him. Apparently he had no called no showed since Tuesday. I just sighed in disappointment, damn it would've been great if the guy told me he was quitting. But hey can't make everyone your friend. I just paid for my Iced tea and headed to building 1. 30 minutes into my shift I heard someone scream. It sounded like a man, but where was it coming from? I ran outside even though I known for a fact I heard the scream inside. I went back in to look for secret compartments or something to indicate I'm not just hearing things and going crazy. And of course to no avail I came up with nothing.
    
     The incident was so bizarre that I forgot my phone in the building. I didn't realize until building 4. Paul's voice came to mind ""Don't come back until the next day"". But why? Security measures of course but it all just made no sense anymore. What the hell would I possibly do to sabotage the company? I mean I'm just coming back for my phone. So It was decided, once my shift was over I'd head back over to building 1. Unfortunately it was winter which meant the sun starts going down at 5:30. So when 6pm came it was dark outside. As I pulled up to building 1 I got a weird feeling as if I shouldn't be there. Paul's words kept going through my head. But man fuck all that. A nigga need his phone. I unlocked the door and the first step I made in I fell. I fell for 10 seconds until I dropped into some cold deep water. I swam up to the surface violently coughing and trying to catch my breath. Everything was dark except the small light above which was the generator rooms front door. I looked around frantically because it was pitch black all around me. I finally turned to see a faint blue light about 50 feet ahead. This was going to be hard considering I wasn't the best swimmer around. I slowly did a breast stroke and soon enough my legs touched ground allowing me to walk closer to this blue light. I soon walked to solid ground with dripping wet clothes. Breathing hard from the exhaustion of swimming in such frigid waters. When I came to my senses I saw I was in some sort of cave opening. I walked deeper into the cave and got more visual of my surroundings. I saw hundreds of thick metal wires that surrounded the entire area. I wasn't in just some cave. I was in a cavern made completely up of wires. 
I finally came across a large room the size of a baseball stadium. What I saw not only froze me in fear but completely bewildered my mind. There, hanging from tubes on the ceiling we're people with their mouths and eyes wide open glowing, with their veins being bright blue. I just stood there in shock until I saw a familar face. It was Anthony! There was nothing I could possibly do to save him now. So I just ran out of that room and back to where that small lake was and looked for some sort of opening. Luckily I found another passageway that was dark but l had a pen light. I ran through that tunnel and came up to a ladder leading up to a sewage drain. I pushed the lid open and got fresh air. When I climbed out I saw that I was by the Copley liquor express. I just closed it back carefully and walked away hoping no one saw me. I walked all the way back to my car but before I got in I heard an all to familiar ringtone and a Pauls voice saying ""Looking for this"".",1,1731306323.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

I had been going without for awhile so I figured ok I have 3 loud kids I need to hear lol. So anyways fast forward he asked why I was deaf in my right ear and I told him the story my mother told me. That the tube killed the nerve endings and boom no hearing. So he had me get an MRI to see if that was the case .. was not the case I guess but when I got the MRI and got the results back I was told my MRI showed ""Small scattered punctate white matter lesions"" and that it would normally be unremarkable but there were more then normal for someone of my age (36). But upon looking up some of the possibilities that he suggested one was it might be an early onset of -MS and it seemed to connect a few more dots then others but I didn't think much of it until recently as my eyes have gotten blurrier and I have tightness and nerve and muscle pain in my right arm almost daily . And I also noticed other symptoms as well. But the pain is what is irking me and sometimes when I am writing my hand just decides to not be legible or work for me and I have to write in scribble and sometimes my hand feels numb. Sometimes in the morning I can barely hold my coffee cup and it feels like I'm going to drop it. So I don't want to be annoying or a hyperchrondiac but does this symptom happen commonly with MS and would it be worth rescheduling the MRI? Or am I just going to be wasting someone's time ?
