I moved to overnight retail at an 8-12 (get it?) convenience store. It's more physical work but it's an extra three dollars an hour from Night Audit around here.

I'm trying clean & restock the coffee station when Same Guy walks in wobbling like an under fed new born foal. So I break off and head over to wait at the check out counter. Same Guy grabs a cold case of beer and stumbles up to the counter before dropping his ID next to the case of beer on the counter.

I tell him politely before checking anything he's too drunk and I can't sell him any booze. In my party elder wisdom I suggest Gatorade and some pizza in the warmer instead to help with the future hangover.

But according to him no one tells him what to do and a rack of 300 Minute Energy drinks gets smashed onto the floor. I start smashing the robbery button for cop help just before an end cap of various candy got thrown on the floor. 

I get from around the counter and Same Guy starts suddenly moving towards the front door. Seems being a foot taller & fifty pounds heavier than a grown up toddler really helps with non physical direction.

A local cop pulled in with lights on when Same Guy was walking back to his car. Local cop confronted him, there was some loud but undecipherable discussion before Same Guy ended up cuffed in the back of the local cop car. He needed Same Guy's ID because he's DUI.

I had totally forgotten about it and pick it up from the counter.

Then I saw the name and face on the ID and started laughing my head off. Local cop even asked me if I was OK.

I Same Guy him out of a Triple Nut thirty miles away last December because he had trouble with sex workers. Apparently he would contact three or four and then only actually hire the first one that shows up. A sex worker screaming at him in the hallway is where I encountered Same Guest the first time on night audit and he was trespassed the same night.

After explaining the history of my reaction local cop started giggling too.

Now I've got trespass orders against the same guy in two different industries.

It's morning now as I type this out. I am trying to beat the sun and get into bed before the first rays of dawn slither through my blinds and confuse my circadian rhythm. The curse of night shift. My nights typically start at nine pm and end by about five in the morning. Always dependent on how sloppy the shift went. Last night was one of those nights. Our patrons I deliver to found out it was my last week and were none to happy to hear about it. A few of there reactions make me incredibly nervous for my next shift. I will have to bring another set of clothes or maybe ask Frank if I can take some extra aprons and towels, better yet an extra bottle of blessed oil, and some sigils to pin to my clothes, maybe a quirt gun with florida water steeped with wolfsbane. Or better yet a flamethrower based off how Jim reacted to me breaking the news. They all scare me but Jim, he is dangerous. Like reality shifting, perma-nightmare molecular torture for all eternity kind of dangerous. Why was he so mad? Charlene told me they wouldn't be happy. I mean every night is borderline deadly but I really didn't think it would get this bad. I don't think whatever these stains are will ever wash out. I will probably just need to burn this shirt, I cant risk another wardrobe possession and have to awkwardly explain to my landlord why my dirty work clothes are running around trying eat the other tenants, again. Sorry I'm rambling.

I work for a donut shop, circle of sugar donuts to be exact. Best coffee and maple bars in the county. We even put bacon on some of the maple bars. Our bakers really love to experiment and its one of the reasons we have been in business for so long. My personal favorite is our brown butter cinnamon glazed rings. Those things sell out fast. Don't even get me started about our coffee, but I digress.

Circle of sugar is an great place to work don't get me wrong. I really have enjoyed my time here but I just have to follow my dreams. I will be going to film school next semester in state far away from this place. I just felt like telling people about the reality of what is going on up here is something I had to do. I am leaving out the specific locations for everyone's safety. I don't want some savvy reddit detectives opening a door their not necessarily prepared to close. Though in all reality if someone dug deep enough they could figure out where the delivery route leads.

I suppose I should start from the beginning to paint a better picture. This was one of those jobs where you heard about it through a friend of a friend. They never placed ads for the position. I learned this was because they wanted someone who could directly vouch for the person applying. The interview was definitely one of the strangest I had ever been through. I showed up early in my best outfit and was greeted by the barista. She had me take a seat and offered me a free which I gratefully took. The front of the store was your typical donut shop. Bright pink boxes, shining polished display glass holding an array of sugared jewels of all shapes and sizes. A tip jar full to the brim. Bright eyed teenagers helping customers who lined out the door. Busy place, a good sign that I had chosen a decent place to work.

""Bill?"" A man in an apron stained with chocolate frosting stood with my resume in is hand.

""Yes Hello sir."" I replied

""Call me Frank, pleasure to meet you Bill lets head back to my office.""

I shook his immense calloused hand trying and failing to match his grip.

The hallway was the first indicator of how strange this job was going to get. Various symbols were painted along the walls in a red color that looked like rust. Circles in circles with zigzag patters and what looked like Hebrew written along the outer rings. Dolls made of flowers and bones hung from certain parts of the ceiling. We passed an opening to the kitchen where several bakers stood around a table chanting working a pile of dough. I swore the dough looked like it was moving around at first glance. 

""Right in here Bill.""

We turned into a small room before I could be sure. It was the size of a small closet and cluttered with papers, empty pink donut boxes still un-assembeled and wrapped in plastic, a wall of security camera monitors and a huge cabinet with two doors closed behind the chair of Franks desk. We both took a seat and went through the typical back and forth of a normal interview. Frank seemed pleased with my responses and sighed deeply before opening a drawer in his desk and pulling out a non de-script bottle of brown liquid.

""Bill would you join me in having a drink?""

I froze, the question making me stutter out ""A drink?""

I wondered if this was some sort of test. As if reading my mind Frank said ""Don't worry this is not a test I just like loosening up a touch with my new hires to get to know them better.""

I nodded, slightly nervous at the prospect. This was beyond odd but I really did want this job. The town I'm in doesn't have a ton of prospects and the pay was the best I had seen in a long time for a simple delivery job.

""Sure why not."" I said smiling in a way that probably communicated my apprehension.

He poured us both a glass and we clinked our glasses before shooting back the harsh liquid. It was whiskey I assumed. It tasted a little watered down but still burned as it made its way to my stomach.

Frank stared at me smiling for an uncomfortable amount of time. I started to think it actually was a test, one which I had failed miserably.

""Bill do me a favor can you hold out your hand for me?""

""What, uh, yeah."" I replied dumb founded before holding my hand out across the desk. Frank reached back in a nook of his clutter desk and retrieved a salt shaker. While maintaining eye contact he began sprinkling salt in my open hand before quickly pulling back as if it would explode. I began to sweat nervously thinking I had made a grave mistake and my prospective employer was a complete nutjob.

After a time he relaxed and said ""Excellent, OK good, you can just toss that down.""

""I'm sorry but that was actually all a test and you passed. We can move onto the second part of the interview your doing great Bill.""

I sheepishly dropped the salt and wiped my hands together to get the rest off.

""What kind of test? This is all a little odd sir, with all due respect.""

Frank looked down at my resume skimming through, ""To make sure your human.""

""Human? Do you get a lot of non humans applying for this job?"" I asked in a tone I regretted as soon as it came out of my mouth.

""You would be surprised. Just bear with me a little longer Bill I understand the strangeness of all this but It will make sense as we finish out. If by the end you don't want the job no hard feelings OK?""

I nodded slowly, curious as to where this was actually going.

Frank began a series of rapid fire questions.

Do I believe in the paranormal? Have I ever encountered a non human entity? Do I believe in other dimensions? What is your experience with occult practices?

I guessed I was answering correctly by Franks nods and continuous smile. We finished the questions and Frank leaned back pouring another shot.

""You don't have to have another if you don't want one Bill. It's just jack daniels watered down with holy water nothing to crazy.""

I felt curious to hear what he had to say next but also plotting my escape from this office and out into the safety of my car.

""The job is yours if you want it but I need to explain a few things. You will be assisting the bakers for the first half of your shift, frying and prepping dough. The second half will be delivering orders across and out of town in our truck. We also have a menu which is not available to the public. It caters to a clientele who need certain requirements. Our job is to keep that specific clientele happy in order to keep the public safe. We make and sell donuts here but we are also part of an organization. One which has been around for as longer than I can tell you. We help to keep the shadows satiated so to speak. Now I understand this is a lot but I can guarantee this is all very real. As I said the job is yours if you are still interested but I cant go into much more detail unless you take the position. So what do you say Bill, is this something you are interested in?""

I sat under the weight of what he had just said. I didn't feel as though he were lying. His confidence and casual manner of speaking about it all made me believe him. It was all weird but if I am being honest this was the most interesting thing I had ever come across in our boring little sleepy town. I wanted to know more, even if it all was a huge hoax my curiosity was peaked, and there was something I just really liked about Frank.

""I accept the position.""

Frank grinned ear to ear reaching out his massive hand. We shook and hammered out the details for when exactly I would start.

 Frank explained ""I will be the one to train you on the routes and our head baker Charlene will train me on the baking and prep.""

""Can you explain more about the whole shadowy organization menu thing, I mean that is a lot right?""

Frank laughed nodding ""Yes I will get more down to the nitty gritty on your first night. It would be better if we discussed it when you meet Charlene and get out on the route.""

With that I took the job. I'm going to stop here guys as the sun is definitely starting to come up and I am exhausted. I will write in more soon here. It is nice to get this all out finally. Have a good one guys thanks for reading.",1,1741461680.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

I want to take the dogs on walks with him, and dog-sit when my brother goes on tour. I want to ride every ride in the theme park with him, and perform living room karaoke with him. I want to have a two person book club, and cinema club, just for us, as we lazily discuss theories and playfully argue about what movie to watch that night. I want to hold him in my arms as I read to him at night in our bed, and I want to be held by him as he reads out loud for me as I lay with my back against his chest, nuzzled into the crook of his neck. 

I want to marry him on a mountainside in secret, with only our closest friends in on it. On a snow covered hill, or in a wildflower meadow, or under a starlit summer sky, or on an autumnal path in the woods. 

I want to make him his coffee in the morning, just the way he likes it, even though I don’t. And I want to pack his lunch and write little love notes in it, which he’ll hang up all over the studio. A constant reminder of the light that lit up the way. Calling him home to me. 

I want to play video games with him, go on podcasts with him, and stand backstage at every performance, so he doesn’t have to be so afraid anymore. I want him to wander the bookstore while I’m signing my books, with the white dog under the table at my feet. 

I want to visit Santorini with him, and a vast glassy desert of arsenic white, and see the rains down in Africa. Go to comedy shows, and concerts, and festivals with him. I want to watch with glee as his fans show their adoration for him - and I’ll stand nearby, looking like the cat that got the cream, because he’s mine. That the real him is mine. 

I want to be a part of a trio in an old time string band. Two boys with guitars (sometimes) and a girl who’s a little bit psychic - and can sing (sometimes), with the desert cowboy - my brother's husband, cheering us on from the wings. 

I want to grow roses at our country estate, and take long walks at the forest’s edge with him. I want to take a walk with him through his mind, as often as he wants, because I love him so, and want to hear about everything that goes on in that brilliant, beautiful mind. 

I want him to surprise me with a puppy, and I want to surprise him with one too. 

I want to raise chickens with him, and alpacas, and tend a vegetable patch with him. Train jasmine to vine up the arbor of our door. Pick strawberries in the springtime and bake pies, harvest blackberries in the summer to make jam, and bake fresh bread with the windows open, making it and remaking it, the same way that our love will be made and remade each new day. 

I want to build sandcastles with him, and cover his body in warm, soft sand - a disembodied head looking around the beach cheekily, before he stands up to playfully chase me along the shoreline.

# Background

25 male - Started hobby jogging last summer and had a couple stretches of time where I wasn’t getting many miles in. Started getting 25 MPW in October to run a half marathon in November of 2024 and completely bonked on mile 9 - of course. Was certainly untrained and was aiming for a sub 1:45:00 finished the race 1:48:XX. I was upset with this race because I stopped pushing when things got hard/uncomfortable. Realized I needed to prioritize mileage and signed up for another half marathon just days later. 

Maintained 25 MPW to wrap up 2024 and started 2025 with a lot of motivation to embrace the suck. Started getting into the 30-45 MPW territory from January until now. Whether it was windchills of -10, snow on the ground, ice on the ground, or all three - I can proudly say I didn’t miss any mileage for a week. As I said, this was all about embracing sucky things to prepare mentally.  

I ran all of my long runs at the half marathon course which is a course of rolling hills and about 850’ ft of elevation gain which feels like a lot. A lot of long runs were good and a lot of long runs were bad but I just made sure to show up and give effort. 

**Pre-race**

Woke up 4 hours before gun time and had an almost normal routine - Coffee, Water and electrolytes, oatmeal, and skipped the pop tarts because I was not hungry - this may have came back to bite me. 

**Plan**

7:35-7:25 Pace - hang onto that pace and rip the last three miles. 

My coach gave me these paces despite my lack of confidence to hold this for 13 miles. Thankful that I bought in and trusted her. 
. 

**Race**

Miles 1-5 

Of course, things felt easy the first two miles but by mile 3, I noticed I was getting hungry already and super parched. Issue is I don’t drink water on my long runs. I avoided water and touching my singular gel and kept moving through the hills. Average pace through 5 miles - 7:34 

Miles 6-10 

Mile 6 and 7 contain the steepest hill and it’s about a mile long. I failed on this hill nearly everytime during long run race paces so I prepared to keep heart rate in check and make up time on the downhill which I did. Coming into mile 8 I had to get water to get my gel down and this was a rough one. Fought nausea and hiccups from essentially here on out. Things started to really suck about here. Mile 9 starts and it’s an absolute dog fight - this hill is the longest hill on the course spanning about 1.5 miles. Sub 1:40:00 felt a little dicey so despite the pain, nausea, hiccups I battled and fought up the hill. Average pace through these 5 miles was 7:35 

Miles 11-13 

Planned to let it rip on these three miles but the lactate was filled in my legs and it was everything I could do to hang onto my pace. Had weird chest pain in my lungs for about a mile but fought through it. 

The time goals were there but my biggest priority was to not be a bitch and roll over when things got tough like my last half marathon. I felt if I stayed tough sub 1:40:00 would be there. 

The final half mile was confusing, no markings on where to go so I was constantly asking directions to finish off the race. Ripped the final quarter mile at a 6:30 pace and left what I think was all the effort I had at the finish line. 

Finish time 1:39:50 


**Post-race**
Placed 15th overall out of 200 runners. Immediately went for food/gatorade since I was so hungry. 


** Reflection ** 
Eating nearly 4 hours before the race was probably a bad decision - the plan was to eat the oatmeal early then a pop tart an hour before. Even though I ate plenty yesterday, I may have started the race with a lack of calories. I thought I was hydrated and I never drink water on long runs but I had to get a drink on this race. I think this led to so many problems - hiccups, chest pain, nausea? I think this made the race more uncomfortable than needed. 

Proud of my effort considering elevation and my errors - I never waived a white flag 


# Whats Next

Marathon in 6 weeks and dial in nutrition/hydration bc I have so much respect for that distance. I’ll take a couple days here and get back up to 40-50 MPW and do another taper for the full. Goal there is to just finish with effort again.",1,1741461495.0,AdvancedRunning,0,1.0,False
1j6okov,https://v.redd.it/agk0n81mmine1,Reel Editing Advice,"Hi Everyone, Im attempting to self edit a demo reel from 2 professionally shot videos and 3 self shot monologues… 
I know reels should be relatively short and of course I understand why, 
So if I take 30secs from each of the 5 that’s a 2.5 mins which I believe is reasonable.. BUT I’m questioning.. 
Do I leave each 30sec clip intact, do it split them each into 15sec then alternate them to give it more variety and appeal, and with the self tape monologues should I edit out the solid backgrounds and instead use a live background or photo to help it appear more “professional”… 
I do have editing experience so I’m able to do it almost seamlessly and appear believable but I’m questioning if I should… 
Additionally, one of my monologues (IMO one of my best) is not the preferred orientation because it was slightly cut off and I had to crop it but it’s a great piece…. (I’ll add it here and maybe I can get some feedback and CC)… The prologue is a psych ward patient who is asked to explain why she violently broke the coffee table..

(Burner account, only here to ask this question).

I (27F) and this guy (29M) know each other for a few months through a weekly language exchange that we do. 

We met yesterday too, as usual but this time instead of coffee, we got drinks. It was late, I was tipsy and he was in a good mood too. 

We came to my place, we started doing the deed and then, maybe it was the drinks and the general tiredness (it was late already) but he couldn't keep it hard on. And he said he's tired too. 

(Also, not proud to say this but he has a partner and kid, and I have a partner too but what's happened has happened. I have no intention to dwell over this whatsoever. And please, I'd rather not receive advise on morality and why this was bad. If it's bad it's bad but too late and well, save me the judgement, please 🥲.)

I was tired as well, so I didn't mind as much. It was a heat of the moment, so I was okay that it wasn't so great as an experience. 

But my question is, could it be possible that he just found me unattractive all of a sudden? Or that he immediately thought of other things that put him off? 

He told me he's on medications (for depression, if I remember correctly) and that's why he takes a while to come and he said, ""yeah, I know it makes you tired.""
He asked if we could cuddle and I was ofc, happy to do so. I did ask him if it was me who ""turned him off"" and he said no, not at all. But I am confused now. 🙄

Anyways, I don't know what to make of this. I haven't chatted with him since he left. Not even sure if we'll continue to see each other. 

But I am wondering if it's me or what it could be..

Thanks a lot for all your understanding and non judgemental answers.

My step-dad is sometimes abusive and uses violence against me (more in the past, but less now), a 14 year old boy. 

Once he used his extremely heavy weight to trap me under him, and since there are no witnesses, he denies everything, when my mother comes home. 

I am very bad at reasoning and I can't argue as well as him, and he is experienced in phycology and can use manipulative tricks to flaw my argument. He doesn't apologise and even tries to make it seem like I was in the wrong. When he wrestled me, I could not move due to his weight and tried to escape, but he kept repeating ""calm down, I need you to calm down"", as I saw his yellow teeth and bloodshot eyes staring at me when he was on top of me, in which he was the one who was making me agitated. He then grappled my head and slammed me onto the floor, where I could feel a spark in my head as he did so, and claimed he ""didn't hurt me"" time and time again, since there here no physical bruises. 

But I was emotionally, mentally and definitely physically hurt by this, and I had explain the definition of ""hurting somebody"" to him, and his opinion about the matter was not changed a bit. 

When my mother came home, I was disorientated and couldn't think clearly about what had just happened. We had an argument, and my younger sister and mother became involved, and my younger sister defends my step-dad, because he is very nice to her, and is strangely affectionate to him compared to me. She has also attacked my before, but I remember I was in the wrong for that situation. However, in my opinion, I think she is not very polite, and quite arrogant, boasting about her achievements. 

This situation all happened, when I was recording an audition for musical theatre, and while recording, my step-dad walks into the room, and tells me to stop the recording, because the neighbour's dad of 2 had texted him that his daughters need to sleep. We had an extension, which was not connected to the walls of their house, I suggested that I could do it there. I am a busy person and I could not do the audition at any other time due to my extra curriculars that I participate in. I had received the information at a very short notice, so I could only do it on the Friday, since Saturday was the deadline. I told him that ""I could do it upstairs in the extension"", and he said with a very firm ""no"". Then I said, ""the extension!"", ""on the top floor!"", and he repeated ""No. I doesn't matter!"" and followed by mentioning the mechanics of chimneys and sound waves, and I kept saying ""This shouldn't affect the neighbours!"" and then he shouted ""NO!"", with his eyes open like a gecko staring right at my soul, because apparently that's what his dad always did to him and always beat him up. 

And I was prepared for this, as I was like ""what is your problem???"" and for some odd reason, he got furious and ran up to me like a giant rhino and just before he could get me, I hit him (without any force or intent) with self defence. He had beaten me before, but then he got even angrier and scrunched up my lyrics for audition and grappled onto me (he was still on top of me) and slammed my head onto the floor, almost disorientating me and I was immobile, and I tried as hard as I could (I literally work out), but he was too heavy (he is on ozempic btw). I tried to call for help, but it was no use, so I got agitated and trapped, and it is hard to believe it was real. It was so weird, because he sat on me! I smelt his stinking, coffee odour breath, as his face was so close to mine, and he tried to trick me by thinking I was the one who was violent, agitated and at fault, when I LITERALLY was fighting for my life. Then I hit him in the face but he did not budge, so I crawled out with all the remaining force of my body, and he stood up and he was so unforgiving. 

Around 30 seconds later, my mum who was already in the house at this time, came in followed by my sister, and I got so frustrated because they had missed the whole event unfold. They couldn't even hear me until I screamed (sort of shouted) while disoriented, and my mother tried to sort things out. In my opinion, she is mature, and intelligent, and can figure out what had happened. My step-dad's face was shifted and it was obvious that he was trying to hide the fact that he did this. I had so much physical evidence of him scrunching my paper and the coffee table and carpet told many stories, being pushed back and wrinkled. He then continues to DENY THAT HE EVER DID THIS, and continues to interrupt me every single time I said a word. I felt extremely frustrated, and I began to shout at him, while sister, (who didn't even see the event), immediately defends my step-dad, and screams at me directly telling me ""stop arguing with \[stepdad\]!"" 

I am a passive person and I don't like to fight, but defend myself, and I have realised having the better argument and being mature does not actually win arguments. However, my mum had realised what had happened, and knew that this is what he would typically get upset and do. She knows what I would get upset for, and I tell him that violence is never the way to resolve anything. But then he denies that he was ever violent, and says that I was the one who started the conflict. He says that nobody should ever sing ""this loud"" (I was doing an important audition + I wasn't even singing loudly), and that he was actually calm all the way, and I was the one who was angry and violent. My mum did not believe this bs, and tells him that he stands for the neighbour way too much, in which he replies that he is trying to be a good neighbour. But then I say, I wanted to help the neighbour too, but I wanted to do it in the extension in which he claims he ""didn't hear"" I said that. 

All I wanted was at least an apology, but he doesn't do this, just complained about how ""tired"" he was from arguing. I remember my sister crying at that moment, (even though she wasn't even involved) and went to bed, and we agreed that when the neighbour is concerned about noise, she would be the first one to be informed. She also told me that I could still complete the audition upstairs if I wanted to, but I was so hurt that I eventually didn't submit it. I now feel unsafe at home, because the consequences could be worse if another situation arises, and nobody is there to save me. 

I wanted to call the police, but I don't believe any charges could be put against him, and I had literally no evidence, and it is such a minor thing currently. He is now not talking to me whatsoever, and I scared for my life. I asked my mum ""why are you even with this guy"", and with tears, she says that he still loves me and won't do it again. He didn't even accept that he did it. 

As well as this, he is the bread-winner of the family, meaning there is some intermingled reliance on this guy. I don't even want to think about it, but I feel like I am WAY TOO FORGIVING, and some day I will forget about it, until it happens again. I have no bruises but I don't want him in our family now, because it makes me feel extremely unsafe. Simply providing doesn't make a good father.

1j6oa0v,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthProductsNatural/comments/1j6oa0v/best_sleep_patches/,Best Sleep Patches?,"For years, I struggled with **falling asleep, staying asleep, and waking up feeling exhausted**. I tried everything: melatonin pills, herbal teas, meditation apps, white noise, blackout curtains—you name it. Some worked for a while, but nothing stuck.

Then I came across **sleep patches** and wondered if they could be a better solution. The idea of a **slow-release transdermal patch** seemed different from traditional sleep aids, so I decided to test one.

I went with **Wellamoon sleep patches** because they had good reviews and contained natural ingredients. I wore a **Wellamoon sleeping patch** every night for a month, and this is my full experience.

# What Are Sleep Patches?

Sleep patches are **small, adhesive patches** you place on your skin before bed. Instead of swallowing a pill, the ingredients **absorb through your skin** over several hours, helping you fall and stay asleep.

Many brands exist, but I chose **Wellamoon sleep patches** because they use **slow-release technology** and contain well-known sleep-supporting ingredients:

* **Melatonin (7mg)** – Naturally regulates sleep cycles.
* **Valerian Root (27mg)** – Helps reduce stress and anxiety.
* **Hops (16.53mg)** – Traditionally used for relaxation.
* **Magnesium Malate (41.32mg)** – Supports muscle relaxation and deep sleep.

You apply the patch **on your forearm, thigh, shoulder, or stomach** about an hour before bed, and it releases the ingredients gradually throughout the night.

If you want to check it out, here’s where I found mine: [**Wellamoon Sleep Patch Info**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2J8ZH9TQ/?source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HealthProductsNatural)

# First Night: Initial Impressions

I didn’t expect much on the first night. I applied the **Wellamoon sleeping patch**, went through my usual bedtime routine, and got into bed.

Within about **20 minutes, I noticed a subtle wave of relaxation**. It wasn’t like taking a strong sleep aid, but I felt calmer. I fell asleep in **about 30 minutes**, which was faster than my usual tossing and turning.

The real surprise was waking up. I **slept through the entire night** without waking up once, which rarely happens for me. More importantly, I woke up **without the groggy feeling** I usually get with melatonin pills.

# Weeks 1-2: Early Changes

By the end of the first week, I noticed:

* Falling asleep was **consistently faster**.
* I wasn’t waking up multiple times a night.
* No side effects or morning grogginess.

The **slow-release melatonin** seemed to be the biggest difference. Unlike melatonin pills, which hit all at once and fade too quickly, the **Wellamoon sleep patch** kept me sleeping through the night.

# Weeks 3-4: Long-Term Effects

By the third week, I felt a real shift in my sleep cycle. I was waking up **naturally, at the same time each morning**, without an alarm. Even on nights I didn’t use the **Wellamoon sleeping patch**, I still fell asleep easier than before.

By the end of the month:

* My **energy levels during the day improved**.
* My sleep was more **consistent and restful**.
* I didn’t feel the need for **multiple cups of coffee** to function.

It wasn’t just about sleeping longer—it was about the **quality of sleep**. I felt **refreshed in the morning**, something I hadn’t experienced in a long time.

For those interested, here’s where I got mine: [**Wellamoon Sleep Patch Details**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2J8ZH9TQ/?uid=34563&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HealthProductsNatural)

# Are Sleep Patches Better Than Pills?

Many people rely on **melatonin pills**, but sleep patches seem to have some advantages:

* **Slow-release formula** prevents sudden wake-ups.
* **No digestion required**, meaning higher absorption.
* **No risk of overuse** since the ingredients enter gradually.
* **No morning grogginess**, unlike high-dose melatonin pills.

Some downsides:

* They **may not work for severe insomnia**.
* **Skin irritation** can happen if applied in the same spot too often.
* Results **vary from person to person**.

# Are Wellamoon Sleep Patches the Best Sleep Patches?

I haven’t tried every brand, but out of everything I’ve tested, **Wellamoon sleep patches** worked **better than melatonin pills and herbal teas**. They helped me:

* Fall asleep **faster**.
* Sleep **deeper**.
* Wake up **without grogginess**.

They won’t work for everyone, but if you struggle with **light sleep, waking up frequently, or poor sleep quality**, they’re worth considering.

Through my story, I so want young girls to stay careful & not fall prey to groomers. 

I was 16 (11th standard) I was naive, joyful & full of hopes & faith. My professor was in his mid twenties, I was studying in his coaching class. He was very charming, friendly & had a charismatic personality that impressed all of us students, boys included. He was cool, funny & great at the subject he taught us. I really looked upto him, because initially he saw the spark in me & often appreciated me in class for being a good student, he said he saw a lot of scope in me. 


Me & a lot of other girls obviously had a crush on him, he was friendly with us to the extent that he would take us ( as a class ) out for playing cricket, take us out for treat & for waterpark trips. But he had one bad quality that we all were scared of & that was his raging anger. We had to be cautious about the mood he was in, if he’s in a bad mood, we’re all in trouble. He would yell at us really bad, insult us & a lot of times often beat students up if they didn’t score well or couldn’t answer properly. 


He had thrown a farewell party for the seniors who were leaving coaching soon & that was when he behaved flirty with me. My silly friends before this farewell party would all the time tease me saying “he doesn’t get mad at you, he’s so gentle with you, he has a soft corner for you”. But in this farewell party, I myself felt this interest in me that he had. After a day or two of this party, he texted me saying how gorgeous I looked that night. I got nervous but I took this lightly. He soon started texting me more & one day he asked me out for a date. I was shocked, confused.. I just knew this isn’t right but i also had a crush on him & unfortunately I gave in & went on a coffee date with him. We started going on more coffee dates, he would buy me gifts, we started meeting after class sneakily. It was thrilling, exciting & intense. He would go easy on me with homework & stuff & would give me special attention behind the scenes on topics I couldn’t understand. He made me feel so special! One day, he called me to his office on a sunday & there he had the whole room decorated with balloons & flowers.. he went down on his knees & asked me to be his girlfriend. He also made a video edit of all my photos. He admitted that this relationship is unethical & that he feels guilty but he really loves me & thats when I fell hard for him! 


Slowly he started pushing me to get intimate with him. I was naive & he was my first kiss. I got addicted to him really fast. Just a kiss, started turning into more because of the way he would convince me to do more. & I somehow gave in, i feel so stupid for this! & then within no time, he started behaving cold, he would ignore me for days & I had no idea why? The only reason he gave me was that he’s busy. He would only meet me in private in order to only get intimate. I knew he was losing interest in me & just to hold onto him, i still went ahead with it. During all this he would get angry with me for no reason, yell at me in class & abuse me more in private for the smallest of mistakes. I somehow held onto him for 2 years. It became a torture for me to see him everyday in class & try to focus on studies, with all this behaviour of his, I started failing in tests & doing miserable. I was anxious all the time. 

He would bodyshame me & say that I’m good for nothing. He would meet me only when he wanted to obviously to get intimate. I couldn’t accept the fact that he was using me. Until one day I got to know he was cheating on me with a few more girls of his other coaching classes. I lost it, i decided to take revenge & confront him & all he did was abuse me, slutshame me & that he would go to my parents to tell them how I was a slut doing all this with him. I had no option but to let him go. 


I was lost, depressed for months. I couldn’t eat anything & threw up & couldn’t sleep. When I look back I don’t know how i dealt with all of it. Let me tell you that i got to know a lot of teachers knew about our affair & how shitty he is, but no one came & told me anything. A few days back I saw him with a young girl who was most definitely his student & there he was grooming another girl & living his best life. How can I even protect these girls?

My Take on Being a Woman in India.,"It’s March 8th, 2025, International Women’s Day, and I’m sitting here in Hyderabad, sipping my coffee, thinking about what it means to be a woman in this country. I’m 30, a gynecologist, married a few years, and I’ve seen enough through my patients, my staff, my friends, to know the crap women deal with here is unreal. This isn’t some polished essay, it’s me, unfiltered, spilling my guts about the reality of being a woman in India.

I’ve got women walking into my hospitals every day, heads down, whispering about their bodies like it’s a crime to even ask. “Doctor, is it okay to feel this way?” “I don’t like it with him, something wrong with me?” It’s 2025, and they’re still taught sex is this shameful thing, something you endure for your husband, not enjoy for yourself. If they dare admit they’ve got desires, or, God forbid, act on them outside the “rules,” they’re branded sluts, whores, ruined. I’ve had patients tell me their husbands forced them, left them bruised and bleeding, but they won’t call it rape. “He’s my husband, how can it be?” Because we’ve got no law saying it is, that’s how. We’re out here building rockets, but can’t protect a woman in her own damn house?

Then there’s the clothes thing, I see it all the time. My nurses, my cousins, my friends, they love their sarees, their sleeveless tops, their shorts at home. But the minute they step out, the moral police pounce. Aunties clutch their dupattas, uncles grumble “girls these days,” random creeps on the street think they’ve got the right to judge. “Yeh kya pehen rakha hai?” I’ve heard stories, a nurse got scolded by her landlord for a deep neck blouse, a friend’s sister got an earful from her in-laws for a backless choli at a wedding. Meanwhile, men strut around in lungis or tight tees, and nobody cares. Why are women the ones stuck lugging “culture” around? Who gave these clowns the authority to play fashion cop?

The patriarchy’s everywhere, I see it in my hospitals, even if I don’t deal with it myself. My female staff tell me about patients who won’t let them treat them because “lady doctor kya jaanegi?” My friends in other jobs get talked over by men who couldn’t tie their shoes right. At home, their in-laws nag them to cook after 12-hour shifts because “aurat ka kaam.” It’s the same garbage across the board, the “posh” crowd shaming you for not having kids yet, the “prude” crowd judging you for working late. Rape, molestation, casting couch, it’s all there. I’ve heard actresses cry about directors demanding “favors” for roles, interns breaking down over creepy seniors groping them. And what’s the advice? “Adjust.” Adjust to what? Being treated like dirt?

Don’t even get me started with the rape crisis. Everyday, girls as young as 10, women in their 60s, assaulted on buses, in alleys, at home. The wounds are bad, but the blame’s worse. “Why was she out?” “What was she wearing?” “She shouldn’t have been drinking.” It’s never about the bastards who do it, always about her. Then there’s slut-shaming, my friend posted a beach pic in a bikini, and the trolls lost it. “Sharam nahi hai?” Another got called “cheap” for wearing shorts to a party. Wear a skirt, date a guy, speak your mind, bam, you’re a slut. They’re out here living, and society’s furious about it.

Freedom’s a joke too. Movies get butchered if a woman’s too bold, news channels freak over a low neckline but ignore dowry deaths or harassment stats. My staff tell me they’ve posted about women’s rights online and gotten hate, “Aise kyun bolti ho?” Because they’ve got mouths, that’s why. But no, we’re supposed to stay quiet, look pretty, nod along.

India’s priorities are a mess, we’re obsessed with policing women’s hemlines, their dating lives, their voices, but not with fixing the real problems. Rapists walk free, marital rape’s still not a crime, casting couch is just “how it works.” We’re building fancy malls and tech parks, but a woman can’t walk down the street without looking over her shoulder. It’s infuriating.

But I keep telling them, my patients, my nurses, my friends, my family, don’t stop. Wear that damn crop top, chase that crazy dream, love whoever you want. Your sexuality, your passion, your life, it’s yours, not theirs. The moral police, the patriarchy, the haters, they don’t get to own you. I’ve seen women push back, bit by bit, and it’s badass. A nurse wore a sleeveless kurta to work and stared down the glares. A patient left her abusive husband and started over. It’s hard, it’s messy, but every time they fight, they’re winning. I wear my deep necks, I speak my mind, I live how I want. It’s not always easy, the glares sting, the fights drain you, but every time I stand my ground, I feel freer.

How do we fix this? Laws, make marital rape illegal, fast-track rape cases, punish the creeps, not the victims. Education, teach boys respect, not entitlement, teach girls they’re enough. Call out the idiots, the nosy neighbors, the sanctimonious relatives, the troll army. And give women space, in films, news, power. Let them speak, let them lead. It’s not quick, but every step counts, every “no” to nonsense, every girl rocking her shorts, every voice that won’t shut up.

It’s Women’s Day, and I’m not here for the fake smiles or sappy cards. I’m here for the real stuff, freedom, respect, power. These women aren’t just wives or daughters or moms, they’re fierce, messy, alive. To every woman out there: you’re a bloody rockstar. Keep pushing, keep being you. And the haters? They can choke on it.",1,1741460490.0,100thupvote,1,1.0,False

That’s not a bad joke—it's a reality Klarna brought to the customer service industry last year. Imagine waking up only to discover your job’s been swiped by a digital assistant who doesn’t even need a lunch break. Ouch. But hey, don't worry, it will never take away your coffee machine... yet.

**Call Center Chaos Unleashed**

The call center industry is spinning as fast as a customer hoping to “speak to a human.” AI seems to bring the dream (or nightmare) of cutting costs into sharp focus, effortlessly handling customer queries without the charm of mild sarcasm that human agents perfect over time. Klarna, the Swedish fintech firm, kickstarted a revolution with its AI doing the job of 700 full-time workers—from complaint handling to sinister ""Can I speak to your manager?"" scenarios—all in a day’s work for this shiny new employee with a flawless performance record.

**The Perks... and Perils of AI Domination**

While the cost savings are delicious to companies, the ethical recipe requires some serious taste-testing. With AI replacing traditional roles, and potentially careers, companies juggle the dual narrative of efficiency and economic impact. Sure, AI does it faster and sometimes even better, but the looming question is at what societal cost? In an era where technology and human employment stand at a glaring crossroads, you can bet the dinner conversation is getting heated.

**What’s Next for Call Centers?**

AI isn't just performing; it's learning. It's changing how businesses operate, especially in areas relying heavily on human interaction. But here's where the story twists—AI’s rapid integration into the workforce raises critical questions about the future job market. Who would have thought we’d find ourselves pondering the ethics of digital employment over breakfast?

The dawn filtered through the cracks of the blind like a thief trying not to be seen, while I struggled in bed with my hand on my forehead, prisoner of a dream that I did not want to let go. Coffee, that bitter concoction that reminds me so much of my own existence, called me from the kitchen, urging me to face another day of this reality we call life, I was going to prepare mate, but I wanted a new experience.

The cup moaned like a damned while I ground the beans with the cockroach, and the aroma it gave off was so intense that it seemed like I wanted to choke me after pouring a little milk into it. ""Birth is a curse and existence a prison,"" whispered the steam rising from the cup, while I, like an automaton, poured more milk and added sugar, as if the sweetness could ease the weight of conscience.

""To live is to suffer, to survive is to find some meaning in the suffering,"" murmured the cocoa extracted in Nicaragua, while I, with trembling hands, held the cup as if it were the chalice of the last communion to overflow with wine. The first sip was like a scream to the edge of my lips, a reminder that, in the end, everything is pain, and that every morning is an awakening in the hell of existence.

The disgusting taste dissolved in my mouth, and with it, the illusions, the hopes, the dreams, the longing for a day where I did not contain caffeine in my blood. That infusion was telling me the story of a man who wakes up one morning and discovers that the world has changed, that there is no longer a place for him, that every step is an effort, every breath a punishment, every black day where he wants everything to be red.

And I, sitting there, with the cup on the small table, wondered if coffee was the executioner, the confessor, or the stalker, if it was the one that kept me in suspense or the one that sank me deeper into the abyss. But in the end, it didn't matter. The American, like life, does not give options. It simply exists.

On January 1st, exactly one month ago, I sent Marcelo Ferrandini—known as Montalvo—the first four chapters of this writing. I wanted his opinion, nothing more, being recognized in his research in Argentina, in addition to his controversial style that I felt at the time was in line with me. I wasn't expecting praise or a job offer, just an honest reading from someone with some experience in the trade. But to my surprise, he was fascinated with my style and offered me a position as an editor at Clarín, his independent journalism digital newspaper.

I received the news with a mixture of fear and disgust with excitement. I had never worked in a newsroom; I had never worked at anything, really. I always considered myself an apprentice, a self-taught person, someone who writes more out of mental necessity than by profession, far from the ""capital contract"" wanting to ""leave my seed"" of knowledge. And yet, there I was, with an opportunity that others would have killed to get, clearly I was very lucky, not many at my age and just starting out get an offer like that.

But the euphoria was followed by anxiety. I could see, in my mind, the faces of my Theory and Practice of Graphic Journalism professors, repeating like gospel that my texts were deficient, chaotic, unacceptable, impertinent to their perfect eye. The teacher of the workshop of that subject, a university version of Tronchatoro, looked at me with contempt from her pedestal in front of Classroom 3, waiting for my every mistake with the same patience with which a cat watches a trapped mouse, about to pull my braids. ""Tell your mommy you'll never pass,"" he seemed to say every moment he explained what he'd done horribly, and in my imagination I was nothing more than a bug under his shoe, doomed to be crushed again and again by faulty syntax or incorrect structure.

Still, I decided to take a chance. Mr. Montalvo gave me the contact information of the editor-in-chief and, after a couple of days, I gathered the courage to write to him. What followed was strange, as if, at the moment of pressing ""send"", something inside me had connected to a larger network, something foreign to my consciousness. A new circuit was activated in my mind, meandering through my pre-existing thoughts, infiltrating the grooves of my reasoning until I could no longer distinguish where I ended and the machinery of the news event began. It was as if an electrical parasite had settled inside me, consuming me with a methodical, inquisitive curiosity, impossible to appease.

The harsh terror of being overwritten by an external intelligence lasted only an instant before becoming an uncontrollable vibration, a muffled scream that dissolved into the fog of my brain. In that moment I understood the magnitude of what I had accepted. Journalism was not just writing news: it was merging with the machinery, letting oneself be absorbed by a system that feeds on information and fresh meat, where each written word is an offering to an invisible god that demands speed, precision, sacrifice and scoop.

And deep within me, I felt the calling. I couldn't resist. My body ached, I longed to be more. I knew that to survive in that world I would have to give myself completely, allow it to reform me, become something bigger, faster, more relentless, I have always dreamed of being like Lanata, there I went up a step to be one.

Turning back was now impossible.

The top editor was Aurélio Cortés. His story had rhymes with mine, as he had also started from the bottom, writing news for Mr. Montalvo until he rose through the newspaper's hierarchy. Now, he was in a position of power, and I was about to present myself to him, not as a simple aspirant, but as someone who, deep down, already knew that he was born to write.

It was not only Mr. Montalvo who read my texts. Cortés also received those chapters and, between sips of mate, he commented bluntly: ""I love your way of writing. Your journalistic chronicles are very good."" It was not an empty courtesy, but a weighty statement, said with the confidence of someone who knows. However, he added: ""I realize why it is more complicated to write chronicles than to write news.""

He had to avoid being lukewarm, but appear to be reckless. Each word had to be measured, each line had to be held with the dignity of someone who knows his worth, but still needs confirmation. So, I wrote an academic, standard, almost disgustingly bureaucratic, but necessary opening. It was the preamble that every speech of this nature requires:

""Good afternoon, dear Mr. Aurélio Cortés. I hope this message finds you well.""

Then, I got to the heart of the matter:

""My name is Fulanito de Tales, and I am contacting you on the recommendation of Mr. Montalvo, who told me to contact him to continue the process for the position of editor at the Clarín newspaper.""

No room for pettiness. It was important to mark the reference of the person who sent me and the reason why it broke into their inbox.

I knew that my lack of formal experience could work against me, but I had something more valuable than that; hunger. And I made it clear in the following line:

""Despite being at the beginning of my academic training, I have previous experience in writing and critical analysis, with a particular focus on political and social issues.""

It seemed like a statement, nothing more. My education at the Faculty of Humanities in Paso de la Patria, Argentina, had given me few tools, but what really sustained me was constant practice, the obsession with writing. Therefore, I added that:

""I am extremely interested in being part of the team of this prestigious media, since I consider that working at Clarín would be an excellent opportunity to develop my skills and contribute from my perspective and style.""

All this, however, had no weight without the next move, he had to show that he was willing to test me.

""Mr. Montalvo mentioned that I should coordinate with you the completion of a test to evaluate my suitability for the position. I remain completely at your disposal to coordinate the day and time that you consider most appropriate.""

I knew it was a message that, in the midst of a boss's mentality, had to be concise and impossible to ignore.

Cortés' message came with the naturalness of someone who is comfortable managing the times as he pleases. There was no rigidity, just a measured informality, a tone that wavered between camaraderie and authority. ""Flexible schedules,"" he said, as if the maelstrom of journalism had not trapped him in an uncontrollable current.

""Perfect, So-and-So. Tomorrow at the same time we will do the Meet. Any inconvenience that may arise, I will let you know in advance. Sorry for the delay, I am having flexible schedules""

I read the message several times. Not because of insecurity, but because of the implicit burden in those lines. It was a confirmation, the first real step in an area that until then had been only a 0% possibility. Tomorrow, at the same time I wrote to you (7:00 PM), the screen would be the beginning of something new.

02/06/2025:

The job interview with Cortés, initially scheduled for January 17, ended up taking place only on the 23rd. Several ""last-minute meetings"" and unforeseen problems postponed it, until we finally managed to make the video call.

During the conversation, I understood the basics. The first two weeks would be a trial: three weekly news stories on popular topics, first Cortés's choice and then my choice. I chose to publish them on Mondays, Thursdays and Fridays. ""Good choice,"" Cortés commented, with a tone that hinted at both approval and a certain camaraderie. Beyond the employee-employer relationship, there was some camaraderie. He was 25 years old, just five years older than me, which facilitated the work dynamic without unnecessary impositions of domination.

At no point did I ask about the pay, I had doubts about everything I was going to do, except that. Not because of a lack of interest, but because of something I learned since I was a child, with my mother's sayings that money comes with effort, and talking about figures too soon can ruin future opportunities. ""Look at this idiot, he asks about pay before doing anything. He doesn't deserve the job or our money,"" something like that I imagined they might think if I hurried. So I accepted the test ""blindly"", trusting that somehow everything would work out in a good way.

Those two weeks were supposed to be paid, although Cortés was not clear about the amount that corresponded to me. ""When you finish the test, I will give you the contact information of the treasurer in charge of that,"" he assured me. With that vague promise, the first step was taken.

The interview was on a Thursday. Just a few days later, on Monday the 27th, I wrote my first assignment for a media outlet, the first tangible step in everything I had done in my career.

Cortés didn't leave me much room for doubt. ""I have you to do the Kuider thing, remember that the crazy man had to go live in Paraguay,"" he told me like someone issuing an order without the need for explanations. Then he added a second, more concise instruction. ""Without subtitles and you are integrating the theme with its important variants.""

As soon as Cortes gave me the directions, I started immediately at 4:47 p.m. m. and I finished the news at 7:51 in the afternoon, the same day. The rules were clear that all news items had to be completed and delivered on the same day they were requested. When I sent him the article, his response was immediate.

""The note is very good. The only 'error' is that you needed to develop the topic of the neighbors a little more, but it is fine. The data and references are well placed.""

Then he added:

""The highlights you made are good too, relevant. However, make them bold, not italic.""

The article was finally published with the title ""Edgardo Kueider is evicted from the 'domestic mansion' where he was under arrest in Paraguay."" My happiness was so great that I felt like my head was going to burst with blood. It was not the satisfaction of having completed my job, but the feeling that something was finally taking shape in my life.

That episode marked a string of publications in the same newspaper, some more successful than others, and others, frankly, atrocious. In my desire to stand out, to devour the media at insane speed, I tripped over my own haste. And the error, the damn error, was none other than a treacherous comma where I should have put a full stop. An insignificant slip for the common reader, but for me, an indelible scar.

Clarín did not take long to notice. And the next news, mine, another imperfect but own creature, appeared transfigured. The structure, the paragraphs, the logical sequence were there, as if a bit of my voice was still trying to make itself heard, but each had been stripped of its aura. My prose was shredded, supplanted by a foreign lexicon, synonyms that did not belong to me, a syntax that seemed strange to me. I was a crooked reflection in a circus mirror, where my style and identity had been modified.

It was devastating, my heart for what I did was shattered. Who would be pleased if his person were replaced by an imposture? Who could bear to see their message stripped away, their literary pulse turned into mere cheap bureaucratic formula? It horrified me to tears. It hurt me with the feeling of an accurate shot, and in that despair I wanted to give in to the temptation of smoking. He had kicked the habit, but like coffee stains on a white shirt, the result of a bad decision, the vice always finds a way to return in the worst mistakes. And that one, which could have been good, was irremediably ruined, stained by frustration and the smoke of a cigarette that was inside me.

02/07/2025:

Friday. I didn't sleep all night. I felt, with a severed nerve, how my brain mass was decomposing, how rot inhabited me, as if a plague of invisible insects were nesting in my skull, gnawing me from the inside. Cockroaches, worms, microscopic nits building their civilizations in the ruins of my thoughts. Maybe I was getting stupider. More than I imagine. Maybe stupidity has already caught up with me and has devoured my tongue, my hands, my eyes, more ideas. Maybe thinking is now just a memory, a useless memory of something I once was. But how to know? I just intuit it. And if I sense it, it must be true, right?

I feel a sting in my right eye, as if it had become the revolving door of a luxurious five-star hotel for viruses and bacteria. I break down, and I don't blame the system. I blame myself. It's easier, more immediate, more intimate, more normalized. I blame myself for every failure, for every carelessness, for every idea that breaks before becoming a word, for every word that disappears before being spoken. But if the world is a crime in itself, why should I settle for my fault?

There are days when I think about the end of the world. Not in a better future, not in the utopia that blind politicians promised us, but in the pure act of destroying everything, of erasing every vestige of what is already shitty, like a God fed up with his imperfect creatures. Didn't he do the same thing in the Old Testament? Didn't it sweep the Earth and start again? Maybe it's necessary. Maybe we should start again.

The afternoon swept me away with the heaviness of days in which time seems to have forgotten to move. ""Hello, Cortes. How are you?""

Silence. One hour and thirty-nine minutes of absence, pure suspense for me, who wanted to know how I was going to continue my work at Clarín, whether they were going to stay on board or whether they were going to throw me overboard.

Perhaps my message was diluted among the previous unanswered messages from Cortés, one more ghost in the digital tangle of my WhatsApp, that man always claimed to be busy, if it wasn't with his streaming program it was with making supposed ""scripts"" and any kind of strange excuse that I didn't understand, nor did I dare to ask either. Or maybe it was read and discarded, relegated to that limbo of pending responses that never arrive, he saw my messages only that he did not have the option enabled to see if he really saw them, marvelous implementation of the truth by digitality. ""What did you think of the two pieces of news I gave you?""

Nothing. The flashing ""Online"" cursor is the closest thing to a sign of life.

Four minutes later, I insist: ""How are we going to handle next week?""

Finally, the answer. A relief as brief as a breath of air before sinking back into the cold arctic waters.

—Good afternoon, Tales. How is it going?—, the bureaucratic tone of someone who responds out of commitment, without space for real conversation, a post-pandemic falsehood.

—I liked the one about the WHO. Not so with the PASO. Then I'll give you good feedback. The note is not bad, the approach is poorly developed—referring to the two previous news items from that week that I wrote and did not publish.

The focus. As if my words had failed in their purpose, as if the angle from which I looked at the story was twisted, out of focus, mutilated. That's how I felt. Maybe he is. Perhaps my very perception is a deformed aberration, a sick eye that does not know how to see.

And that only feeds the parasites more. I feel them move. Little accomplices of madness, building tunnels between my holes, eating my sanity at a pace I don't control. It's not insomnia. It's not anxiety. It is something older, more visceral, schizoid evolution.

But the worst thing is not the mental rot, nor the uncertainty of whether my texts are worth anything. The worst thing is the wait. The dead step between sending and response, between creation and judgment, between the luck of being read and the sadness of being ignored. I write so that no one publishes me, so that no one sees me, so that my name rots in a forgotten file.

I must learn to understand other people's clocks, they tell me. But I don't have that watch. Not a normal one, at least. Mine is unique. Its needles are teeth, its second hand is a blind white worm that advances without haste, eating the patience of those who know that they are impatient.

—Now I am very complicated producing today's stream program, but on the weekend, if you have time, we will have a good chat about how we continue.

A tacit agreement to postpone the inevitable. What if Saturday never comes? What if the chat is going to die where the messages have no realistic response?

—Okay, Cortes. Thank you. Yes, no problem. Don't worry—the automatic words of someone who already knows how this game works, the exploitation of the worker.

I write this here because if I write it down in my notebook, the desperation will become more present. More palpable. Because I know that, by occupying any space, no matter how tiny, I will be corrupting the purity of the empty, contaminating it with my uselessness.

Even if I erase every letter, the damage will already be done. The hole will have been violated. And even if the ink is erased, the scar of what was once there will remain: not something important, not something momentous, just something stupid. A stain on the nothingness of me.

02/10/2025:

At seven o'clock the video call began. An hour before, I was already practicing in front of the screen, rehearsing responses with my reflection. Narciso peeked out from the black glass of the monitor, and I looked at him with the same distrust with which one observes a beggar who looks too much like oneself.

Was he well dressed? Did it look professional? Did he look human? Or had I already become a substanceless avatar of Meta, a pixelated image?

The call was connected. Cortés appeared on the screen, with dark circles under his eyes from insomnia and a cigarette in his hand.

""I like the way you write,"" he said, the words appearing among the white smoke. But the latest news… I don't know. Something was missing. It was empty.

Empty. The word seemed like a diagnosis of death. Empty of what? Of information? Of content? In what sense? It hurt more than it should. It wasn't a rejection, it was a “I give you a 7, but not a 10.” He didn't banish me, but he didn't consecrate me either, he humiliated me.

I couldn't contain my nerves. The bomb fell on Hiroshima.

—Sure, I understand… —I paused, swallowed—. Sometimes I worry that ""flexible"" will end up making me earn less than I should.

Cortés lit another cigarette. He looked at me from his screen, exhaled the smoke with a patience resulting from the same boludization of nicotine.

—Do you have another problem with work?

—Beyond being afraid of making mistakes… I was always very nervous. I am terrified of criticism. Not to corrections, but to my words being modified until they become euphemisms.

Silence. Just the sound of the ember consuming tobacco.

""Then I like you,"" he finally said. I am the same. I can't imagine writing without smoking, if I stop smoking I will be dead. And I'm afraid of what they might say about something I did. We understand each other.

""We understand each other."" I clung to those two words like a castaway to a board. I tried to fraternize with a smile, although I only managed a grimace.

""I liked the work,"" I said, looking at his dark circles. It took me out of my comfort zone, it made me experience the environment...

I paused, not because I hesitated, but because the shock wave of the confession hit me suddenly.

—After this experience, I have thought about smoking again. Because I'm screwed.

Cortes smiled. But it was not a smile of mockery, nor of condescension. It was something more like the resignation of a man who has seen enough beginners.

—Welcome to journalism, it is impossible not to get stressed. Tomorrow, Monday, or Tuesday at the latest, you will be given your number.

I stopped for a moment after the call, as if a premonition warned me late that it was better not to answer. But there is no refuge in evasion. I looked at the black computer screen and there I was, my own reflection watching me with an ambiguous smile. I reminded myself that this present in constant march towards tomorrow was nothing more than a treadmill, we moved forward without moving from the spot. They talk to us about ""progress,"" but progress is nothing more than a mirage, a carrot dangling in front of us as we dehydrate in the desert.

Medicine advances, but not everyone makes progress; some die with wrong diagnoses, others without even having been treated. Human relationships evaporate before being consolidated, bonds do not resist the weight of time. We do not last, we do not endure, we do not live. Work is a punishment without a fixed sentence: flexibility means always being available, getting paid when they decide, receiving what they want to give you. “We always comply,” say the bosses. But when they do, you are already in infrapoverty, in the lowest stratum of dignity, where there is nothing left but to remain silent and be grateful.

In the black I still saw myself, but it was not me, but another failed replica of the same mass-produced human mold. One more product from the work catalogue, designed to be used and discarded. And the company? Abstract. Digital. There is no community, only interaction; there is no affection, only consumption, human waste. I occupy the same place in this society as an empty plastic bottle. I lost the last thing I had: full hope.

I thought about what Asma Mhalla wrote in Tecnopolitics. How technology turns us into soldiers, that technology locks us in echo chambers where everything sounds the same: the same opinions, the same terms, the same idols. A mental officialdom. A cabinet where only applause and confirmations are tolerated, not contrary criticism. The net ""is made of plastic and moves,"" but it does not breathe.

Society was once thought of as a living organism, a body with interdependent organs. Now it is a company, a holding company of atomized individuals, each floating in the uncertainty of their own financial destiny. And not only does it affect us economically—in my case, I still haven't seen the payment promised last Friday the 7th—but it disfigures our values, it tears away our sense of belonging. I haven't spoken to Rous in a while, and I wonder if that's a choice or just the inevitable reflection of this system.

Commitment and loyalty are no longer profitable assets. Instead, uncertainty and detachment have been elevated to virtues. Superficial relationships, chronic anxiety and, worst of all, the inability to imagine a collective organization with minimal certainties.

They have freed us from alienating routines, but in exchange they have condemned us to discontinuity. We float from one project to another without a coherent narrative, without a story that structures us. We no longer adapt to life, we adapt to the frenzy of the market, to capitalist realism, to the vertigo of the ephemeral. There is no fixed job, there is no fixed housing, there is no fixed salary. And if everything is transitory, then nothing makes sense, life is a plastic bottle.

That's why sometimes I miss the truth.

I want to blame the dog but it was me,"This morning my son had a friend coming over to hang out at 11 am. My doberman gets very excited when people come inside and she will run back and forth and jump up and try to lick faces. She will also sometimes jump over the couch. I saw down minutes before the friend was supposed to arrive with a 24 ounce travel mug of coffee (that I can put a lid but didn't) and I set the cup down next to my computer. I have spilled liquid (usually coffee) into 3 or 4 previous computers. I had planned to move my mug to a lower shelf after sitting down but I have a lot of clutter on the lower shelf. As I am making space for my mug, the friend starts coming up our walkway and Luna (my dobie) starts whining and then launches herself over the end table where my laptop and coffee are located. It remains to be seen if coffee got inside but the the top held a pool of coffee. Two pairs of bluetooth headphones got soaked. Two mechanical pencils, a pair of glasses, a book I was reading, a notepad I use daily and two boxes I use to hold small things all got soaked down. Coffee also splashed down the wall, all over the floor, etc. As much as I want to deflect blame, it is my fault. I cant blame the dog for being a dog and any lack of training to stay calm when people arrive falls back on me as well. I know this will impact my mood for the rest of the day.

1j6o2s4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1j6o2s4/going_camping_alone_with_them_help/,"Going camping alone with them, help!","Hi, so my birthday is in a couple weeks and I’m going camping with my crush the weekend before (we both love camping). He has no clue I feel this way about him. 
Backstory- we’ve been friends for a decade now, met in high school. The summer he graduated (a year after me) I though he had a crush on me because he kept sending me good morning texts or snaps every day, we hung out constantly and I even met his family. He had a girlfriend at the time though so I never made any moves, and wasn’t in a place mentally where I wanted to date anyway. 
He texted me one night after a movie with him and a mutual friend asking if I liked him because “my girlfriend thinks you do”. I had never met her so idk why she would’ve thought that, IF she did. I said no and all the good morning texts/snaps stopped…
A few years goes by, we don’t talk much because he got married and had a hectic schedule with work. We would check in with each other every six months or so and that was it. Then suddenly in 2023 he started texting me every day and we finally got to hangout and catch up. I found out he was getting divorced, and we got close again. Hangouts every other week (he would pay for coffee, dinner, ice cream, etc) and he introduced me to a new stepdad at a big event (in which he paid for my expensive ticket without me even asking) and suggested we leave early for ice cream before he walked me to my car. That’s when I realized he may be feeling the same way he had in the summer after graduation, so I started paying close attention. 

The hangouts kept happening, but he never made any moves to hold my hand or do anything at all besides pay for me so I wasn’t sure and didn’t want to make him uncomfortable since he was just recently divorced. My birthday rolled around and he paid for dinner with me and my girl bestie, told her while I was in the bathroom that she didn’t need to pay him back because “it’s her birthday, and you tagged along”. 

By the time I worked up the courage this past fall to tell him how I felt, he beat me to it and told me he had a girlfriend. I bit my tongue, and said I was happy for him and asked what she was like. He seemed really happy, and stopped buying ice cream and stuff for me (which was fine, I’m not materialistic). 

When I got a potential job opportunity as a flight attendant he said he believed I would be good at it, then said “I’ve always wanted to do that, but I’m not hot enough to be one”… later on we were talking about dating people and our types and he said his type is “tall not skinny women who are slightly witchy” which is me to a T. I told him my type, which matches him. 
He broke up with his girlfriend a week later, but kept telling me about people he was talking to. He called me directly after a date too. My girl bestie got sick of all this and called him angry, then ten minutes later called me back all giddy and refused to say what exactly was said but that he would call me and he agreed to talk to me about “us”. He still hasn’t, a month later. 

Now he and I are going camping alone together (partially his idea after everyone but him canceled on the original camping plans) for my birthday, he said he would cook for me and help me set up my tent, and that he loves camping because “the campfire brings out deep conversations”.

Conversations go on longer than necessary.  We always linger together when the conversation should be over since she joined us 5 years ago.

I have many female work friends who I’ve never tried to push boundaries or get sexual, we would get 1:1 coffee or lunch, be alone 1:1 in offices it was never a problem.

I thought it was off and asked a separate friend if it was weird and her response was “this is why girls try not to be friends with guys don’t make it weird”.  So I didn’t.


From the gift things escalated.  We would grab a quick coffee every day at work talk about our daily frustrations, joke about life.  It was great.  I felt a gap filled from some other close work friends who moved on or were promoted where we couldn’t meet regularly. 


Then one day she invites me for a drink with a different coworker after work.  I ask my wife and my wife freaks out “if you have time to plan drinks with so and so why can’t you do things with your wife”.  The thing is I’ve been trying to do things with my wife, she has a trauma history, she doesn’t like leaving our kids with other people and is frequently sick.  I miss having someone to go out to dinner with and shoot the shit with. So much of my interaction with my wife is addressing her anxiety life concerns and managing our kids and household.  There is very little fun, there used to be fun before we had kids,  the kids tap her out it’s too much sensory stimulation. I don’t have a lot of other friends.


My wife asked if I had feelings for my work friend. I said no.  That’l was probably a lie but I couldn’t tell if I had feelings for the person or for the positive interactions we had.  We never communicated without my wife knowing we never were together without my wife knowing.  My wife went through my texts and said my coworker was a negative influence on me because of the way we communicated in jokes, nothing was sexual nothing was disparaging against my wife.  There was a ton of communication chemistry.  I told her if she felt threatened I would go no contact.  


This lasted 2 weeks it was SO hard.  That’s when I knew I was fucked.   My respect only grew for my work friend because she gave me space, we lasted 3 months low to no contact.  We have now been cycling where there will be a check in every few weeks to
Make sure the other is ok, trying to get on projects where we will see each other.  When we overlap in a project it goes 0 to 100 in terms of chemistry and communication.  I have repeatedly told her that I so badly want this to be a good friendship of support, I don’t want to abandon her because she is a good person.


My wife is going out of town for 2 weeks and my coworker knows she sent me an email to see if we could connect for a drink or dinner while my wife is out of town.  I basically told her I respect her too much to keep these microescalations going but I’m happy to be there for her as a friend however I can.


I’m upset because I worry she’ll stop talking to me and I’m worried that I hurt her and she’ll be alone.  We clearly love or are in love with  each other.  I’ve repeatedly told her it’s easier  because we don’t have obligations and that to have an actual relationship would just amplify our obligations as we had to navigate 2 divorces and 4 children.  On top of that she resents her father for his infidelity, I care about her enough that im not going to let her repeat those mistakes with me.

I need a safe place to express my thoughts (posted a pic elsewhere just to say I'm not making this up lol).

A few months ago, she had to relocate to a city about three hours away for work. Since I can't leave my job, I stayed at the apartment we rented together, while she found a new place near her work. But most of her clothes are still here with me—her dresses, skirts, lingerie… and every day, looking at the closet, the temptation to dress up only grew stronger (I hadn't crossdressed since we got together, and she has no idea about this side of me).

It all started one night when I couldn't resist. I shaved my body and slipped into her pantyhose and one of her skirts. The next day, I impulsively ordered a wig and heels online. We're similar in size, so all her clothes fit me perfectly, but I needed the wig and heels to complete the look.

I started wearing her clothes in public, strutting through the store in her cute skirts, picking up more outfits. I love the sound of my heels clicking against the ground, each step echoing with confidence and grace. Almost every night, after Facetiming her, I'd slip into her dresses and accessories. One time, while I was out, a guy approached me and asked if I wanted to grab a coffee. We spent the afternoon chatting, and he was cute. While we sat together, his hand was on my thigh the whole time, and I just let him. He casually asked if I wanted to head back to his place to watch a movie or something. There was a split second where my mind raced, my heart pounding in my chest. I quickly apologized, feeling a rush of panic, and ended up bolting away. When I got home, I went straight to get a cold shower to clear my mind. It was a rush, a strange mix of excitement and confusion. I hadn’t expected it to affect me the way it did, but in a way, it made me feel seen in a way I hadn’t before.

And just like that, the femboy I had suppressed for so long came to life once again. It has been five months now of living this double life. I’m too scared to tell her; I know she wouldn’t take it well, and the thought of her finding out terrifies me.

Great idea, but I lived in a condo with poor ventilation, so that was the end of that.

  
Now I am in a house with a nice balcony just off the kitchen and I've gotten into actual espresso, so I figured for fun I'd try again. Ordered a green coffee sample pack from Coffee Bean Corral.



My first roast went... poorly. Or so I thought. I was aiming for medium. I don't like super light roast espresso, and I'm trying to build my palate away from dark roasts. I didn't really hear first crack, mostly because I was expecting a series of pops, rather than just an occasional snap. Hit what was clearly second crack when it sounded like actual popcorn and it was smoking like crazy. Pulled it immediately. Way too dark.

  
But whatever, I'm not going to waste it. I tried brewing some the next day. Confirmed--bitter, way too dark. Oh well.

  
I randomly tried another double shot two days after that. My grinder was set too coarse for this bean, since I had been brewing something else. The espresso shot came out in like 15 seconds instead of 25-30 like it's supposed to. I tasted it. Heaven! Possibly the best shot of espresso I've ever had.

I inherited two redwood burl coffee tables. Unfortunately, they were coated in some sort of epoxy and then stored in a non-climate controlled and leaky garage filled with a ton of junk for a really long time.

I am going to start with the smaller one first.  
  
The epoxy on the top of the flat part is peeling so I think with some patience I could manage to scrape it all off. However, the epoxy was applied to the rough edges and holes (circled in first photo). How would you suggest getting it off there? The silver lining is that only some of the legs were coated.

Initially it went down like a lead balloon, he wouldn’t talk to me and binned the flowers he bought me. By the next day and the day after we were talking as normal, making tea/coffee for one another and everything was pretty normal minus any physical touching as I requested. 

Today I went to pump my tyres up and after switching on the ignition, it automatically Bluetooth connected to his phone from the house and his last audio started playing. It was a woman’s voice called “chat and interact with [woman’s name]”. I know for a fact this is some sort of AI girlfriend thing as I’ve snooped on his phone before so this gave me opportunity to bring it up without him knowing I’ve been snooping.

So I went in the house and very calmly and nonchalantly said “you could’ve waited until I left before you started chatting and interacting with [name]”. His face dropped, asked what I meant and I explained it came on through the car. He said it’s not a real person (which I know). But I was just very dismissive and said “no, it’s ok, just keep doing what you’re doing cos that side of us is done anyway. I told you keep on doing whatever you’re doing”. I gave no opportunity for an explanation, excuse or lies. Nor do I want one.

I was nervous about buying it due to negative reviews, but I took it on a 7-hour, 18km hike loaded with a camera body, lens, water, coffee, and extra clothes. I used the Peak Design Hip Belt and added Zpacks Shoulder Strap Pads just in case.

The good news is the bag was surprisingly comfortable! The hip belt was absolutely essential, transferring the weight off my shoulders. I barely noticed the heavy load throughout the hike. I'm not sure how much the extra padding helped, but the hip belt made all the difference.

It's true that the straps are quite firm, especially when new. Without the hip belt, carrying a heavy load is definitely not great, and I do feel the pressure on my shoulders when testing it at home. However, with the hip belt engaged during the hike, I experienced no discomfort.

Overall, my experience was very positive. If you're considering the 30L V2, I highly recommend using the hip belt for heavier loads. It transforms the carrying experience. I'm hoping Peak Design addresses the strap firmness in a potential V3, as that would make the bag truly perfect. But for now, with the hip belt, it's a fantastic and comfortable option even for long hikes.",6,1741458069.0,peakdesign,0,0.88,False

Last year, I completed a full year of workouts, about 120 sessions in total. I focused on resistance training and HIIT once a week, with each session lasting at least an hour. I ate well, but hitting my recommended protein intake was a daily challenge. While I built muscle in my arms, back, and legs, I didn’t lose much belly fat.

My doctor recommended IF after my last physical because my glucose levels were borderline high. Despite my diet and workouts, my numbers hadn’t changed from the previous year. 

After researching IF and different body types, I realized that constant protein intake might not have been ideal for me. To hit my targets, I had to eat multiple times a day, which may not have been the best approach for my body.

So, I started intermittent fasting about 28 days ago.

The results are in… I started at 249.4 lbs and now I’m 239.4 lbs! Finally under 240 for the first time in two years. I’ve also lost an inch off my waist.

I started with 16/8 for the first week, then switched between 16/8, 18/6, and 20/4 depending on my schedule. Even on a one-week cruise, I maintained 14/10 and 12/12 and still made progress.

I haven’t changed what I eat and still enjoy dessert almost every other night. However, I’ve completely cut out soda and sugary drinks, even during my eating window. The key to making this work? Clean fasting with black coffee daily.

Shoutout to Fast. Feast. Repeat. by Gin Stephens for breaking it all down for me. I’ll post again when I hit the next 10 lbs and I’ll include actual body pics then!",1,1741457974.0,intermittentfasting,1,1.0,False

1. Maybe I over fertilized her during winter. My fertilizer states to use it every 8-14days which I also kept up during the winter months (I know, stupid).
2. I had to move her back from her usual spot by the window due to the heaters being turned on during winter (her usual spot is about a meter and a half to the right haha).

Education and teaching light up my world, and I’m excited to keep growing in this rewarding field.

I’m **5’4” with deep brown almond-shaped eyes, medium-length dark brown hair, two pierced ears, and three tattoos.**

**I love life’s simple pleasures—sipping a** **cranberry vodka or gin and tonic** while taking in the city lights, sharing a good laugh over coffee and cake, or getting lost in a bookstore for hours. I prefer **quiet moments over loud parties and thoughtful conversations over small talk.** Libraries, bookstores, and cozy coffee shops? Always a yes. I also love **skylines and late-night drives—there’s something magical about city lights against the night sky.**

So, why am I here instead of on a dating app? Glad you asked! Dating apps often feel like an endless cycle—swipe, match, chat, go on a date, realize there’s no spark, and repeat. It gets tiring. I want something more organic, more *real*.

I’m looking for **an old-fashioned romance**—the kind where you go on real dates, where a night out means exploring the world together, not just hanging out at someone’s place. I love creating meaningful memories in real-life settings.

When I’m not working, you’ll find me **writing, drawing, listening to synthwave, or watching nostalgic 80s/90s films.** I’m a die-hard fan of the original *Gossip Girl* (2007—no reboot, please!) and would love a partner who’s down to binge it with me. Some of my favorite films include *Dogfight, Cruel Intentions, Stand By Me, Career Opportunities, Secret Admirer,* and *The Bling Ring.* My playlists are filled with dreamy tracks like **“Sunset” by The Midnight, “Summer Eyes” by Coastal, and “Miracle Love” by Lazer Club.**

While I treasure my independence, I’m ready to share my life with someone who feels like my best friend. I want a connection that’s built on **laughter, trust, and genuine care.** I picture us as that couple who creates silly inside jokes, enjoys the little things, and has each other’s backs through it all. Romantic moments are my favorite—those quiet seconds when you lock eyes, smile, and just *know*.

# What I’m Looking For:

* **Age Range:** 28-37
* **Height:** Preferably 5’10” or taller
* **Build:** Slim/fit/lean
* **Lifestyle:** Drug-free (no molly, edibles, coke, etc.), moderate drinking is fine
* **Location:** Connecticut or within 25-35 miles (U.S./Canada preferred)
* **Relationship Goals:** Long-term, monogamous, with marriage potential—bonus points if you’re open to a family someday!

# A Few Must-Haves:

* You’re emotionally available, stable, and single
* You communicate openly and value consistency (the little things matter!)
* You’re excited about real dates and meaningful experiences
* You’re present in your current life, not caught up in the past

If you’re **kind, stable, and looking for a relationship filled with joy and mutual respect**, I’d love to hear from you! Feel free to send a message, and if we vibe, I’m happy to exchange photos. Let’s see where this journey takes us. 💕",0,1741457816.0,r4r,1,0.33,False

I messaged him on our class chat individually though and asked him to study for the upcomingexam. He said yes sure and agreed to both possibilities on both days. We met up studied for a few hours. He smiled at me like a lot and I actually saw his teeth lol I never did because he’s very shy and doesn’t talk much but he talks with his friends that sit near us like if a normal guy.He isn’t shy with them when talking atleast. I can tell he is shy but the study night was great he was shy but it was cute. After we packed and i normally pack fast but I started packing slow to maybe walk out with him. I just causally asked him do u wna go out to eat tommorow.And he kinda froze and said yeah kinda smiling but shocked look. And I said r u sure u dont have to if u dont wanna and he still said yes. He’s very sweet and my stomach was growling so loud during the study session I said sorry and he was like it’s ok ur good and started laughing.We flirted a little bit during the study session and at time once he had me repeat something 4 times.And just couldn’t focus on answering the question i asked the whole time he was looking at me. Honestly I just thought he was infatuated or just mesmerized with me that’s what it seemed like. His eyes got so big kind of Everytime he looked at me his facial expressions like would widen idk how to make it make sense.I ended up hugging him goodbye that night and said thanks. It was a bit akward but whatever. Next day comes we have our exam we meet up a bit before class, and that day he decides to sit right next to me in class he always sits near me but never right next to me. He could’ve just sat in his normal seat he’s been in the whole semester because he got to class after me .We take the exam and leave after class. It’s like 9:30 so we just go to Chick-fil-A bc everything’s closed. While we were walking to my car heading to Chick-fil-A we were talking about just hobbies and ourselves and how we just did on the exam.I also noticed I usually have to iniated a lot of the conversations to get him comfortable talking in the car. He wasn’t as quite while we were walking to the car he got more quite when we were just sitting in it while I was driving.The study session id say he was more comfortable body language wise where I was shy so my body languae was closed off. When he got closer and moved his seat next to me to see the computer better,Even though it was in the middle of both of us. I would cross my arms not on purpose I promise I j get anxious but I can understand how my body language that day wasn’t rly showing interest until after I hugged him when we head out to sort of show interest. He’d hand me the calculator because we were sharing one and would like kinda touch hands but I didn’t want him to think I’m flirting since I just asked him to study although I do have interest just want to feel it out first yk before rushing anything so I made sure my hand wouldn’t touch his.But when we went out to eat I tried to be a bit more open but when I get nervous or scared I basically face the away and won’t really make much eye contact because I just get nervous.He didn’t pay for me in Chick-fil-A but that was fine because I never specified it was a date but I’ve had male friends in the past that could pick up on the signs that I liked them pay for me. I honestly think he might just not be good at picking it up after I found out he doesn’t rly talk to any girls he told me.and I technically just talked to him for the first time the day before although I’ve always had class for months we start to talk abt ourselves n then he asked about me i told him stuff about me he was smiling. I can tell he’s a private person and I can’t tell if he’s like a strict person he doesn’t have Snapchat I don’t think he has Instagram. Probably has TikTok I only got his discord so we could play fortnite.After he’s asking me stuff I I asked him if he smokes and he said no and he asked if I did. I did lowkey lie and say no bc I’m actually trying to stop and just didn’t wna go into explaining it because most ppl think when ppl say “im quitting” it’s a lie but im not lying ive reached a point I just get high for 15 minutes and it’s killing my money because my tolerance is so high. and been decreasing my use but idk if he saw my cart in my car and also my friend next to me in class asked me if I was high.I wear contacts and when wind gets in my eyes it makes it watery and sometimes red but that’s why I was kinda hesitant to answer and I was like no I don’t smoke and asked him if he’s talking abt nicotine and weed to try to deflect even tho I do both.hes never done nicotine but has done weed but doesn’t like it but he does drink from time to time he says he sounds like he cares about health but he did say he doesnt rly mess with smoking lmao so my heart kinda dropped thinking he’s not gonna talk to me bc of that but said he does have some friends that do he just doesn’t. Forgot to mention he used to drive to school all the time himself now his dad drops him off I’m not sure what happened to his car I didn’t ask because it’s not my business but when we were in class he told me he didn’t drive today and I told him that’s fine I can drive and he kinda looked in me in shock and said ok and just kept talking to me ig he kinda looked surprised. I’m not tryna sound cocky but I do think I’m a very pretty woman but I am private I guess and do have an rbf but I may not be his type because everyone has their preferences.A lot of guys have been atttracted to me or interested in me and kind of distance themselves when they weren’t fully sure I liked them back and wouldn’t rly believe I would like them usually coming from some personal insecurity like their body or looks. I noticed the dude always wears black, and the day we studied he told me he didn’t eat all day besides a banana I think so I kinda felt bad bc it was 11pm but maybe he’s dealing with something.One guy I talked to he was so hot but didn’t even realize. He told me “I didn’t think u would like me bc u seem like u have ur shit togetehr and rly confident” that’s why I’m overthinking this situation. I just feel a lot of times the  guys I’ve talken to think they have to have everything together to be with me. Trust me I deal with my own shit hence why I started smoking again but I know that’s not a good choice and I have only been smoking once a day at night from previously smoking almost the whole day and night when I woke up because I just couldn’t sleep. But besides smoking I’m a very productive person I still focus on my goals but i don’t want to do it forever.I asked him would he want to hangout when he comes bk from break and he was sort of hesitant. He was like “I’ll have to see I’m not sure” or whatever but it was clearly not a yes. And I said oh do u have a girlfriend or something? And he said no I don’t have a girlfriend im single and I asked him has he ever had one and he said no but he’s had romantic relationships with girls. He’s 22 not an issue but I honestly think he might be a virgin and I feel like if u looked at me u can tell I have atleast some experience. I’m not even sure if he’s ever kissed a girl because now that I’m thinking about it he went to an all boys private school in highschool, and in college he said he doesn’t talk to girls.I can very much tell he doesn’t have like any experience rly with girls so AFTER he told me that I was like that makes so much sense I thought maybe I was making him uncomfortable. It’s not an issue it’s just makes sense y he acts like that.And I just said well I just wanted to get to know u yk like we can just hang out, and he said get to know how? I kind of froze bc I do find him attractive but want to slowly build it up I guess by maybe hanging out weekly after class if we’re able too. I was thinking about being more direct and say I was interested in talking to him but I didn’t know what he was thinking. I didn’t know if he was rly against talking to someone or if he was interested in it so I just said get to know to keep it casual. Was this his way of trying to figure out what I wanted for sure? I’m just confused because he was a bit hesitant when I already asked him to hang out again I guess ?And he kinda like just looked at me idk maybe bc I wasn’t trying to give him a clear answer trying not to scare him off saying I like him he’s just rly akward i can tell. I asked him what he does he said he mainly stays at home and hangs out with friends from time to time. So I was like so ur basically a home body and he said I guess? He likes to play video games and I like to play fortnite so I offered to play with him one day. At the end of the night when I was kind of confused why all the sudden he just didn’t seem that interested to hangout like food wise, he did say like we can hangout and study and I was asking him why not like just go out? And he couldn’t rly say an answer. He was like thinking of an answer and was like I’m just not interested but then after that started asking me if I have guy friends and mentioned he doesn’t rly go out much. I’m not sure if he was trying to play it off as friends because I haven’t specified that I like him yet because I’m playing it off as just friends too so rn I just look probably friendly to him I am flirting a little bit but not enough to the point where it can maybe distinguish to him that I like him more than friends. It’s just hard to because I already know he has social anxiety and I don’t want him to feel rushed but I’ve liked him for some time now just had to work up the courage to try to talk to him, and then he just randomly asked me do I have guy friends? And I was like yeah do u not have girl friends? And he said no and then I was like ohhh now this all makes sense why he’s acting very shy. He’s very attractive I don’t think he realizes how much tho. Like I would rate him a 8.5/10.by his confidence I feel he would rate himself a 5/10 I just think a lot of men get insecure about things they think girls care about when they probably don’t if they really like u. Even if it was an actual date for example and I drove who cares. Also a lot of guys tend to not talk to me after finding out my family is wealthy and a lot of them think I require a lot of maintaince ig? When I’m like literally the cheapest person ever meaning I don’t spend what I don’t need to. In relationships it’s not really materialistic things that make me happy. I like love letters my ex used to write me or just it can be so simple as buying a $4 coffee one day randomly or flowers .So ig my question is is he just actually not interested? Why would he just ask if I have guy friends randomly after saying he’s not interested? My friends thought that maybe he thinks I get a lot of guys because he said no to having girl friends and the way he answered it was like a “wtf no”. He didn’t say wtf he said “no but he answered it in that tone basically.and also mentioned that he doesn’t really go out much but went out with me twice? So I’m like was he interested and maybe thinks I’m not. I could tell just me and him hanging out I don’t think he does that often with people besides his very close friends he’s known from highschool or early college. Is he is just deflecting from probably something internally or maybe just no interested. I felt awful after because I thought Did I just misread every sign. Technically I asked him to study and stuff but that was my was of trying to have conversation with him and he could’ve really just seen it as just studying but he agreed to go out with me the next day.My friends said a guy that says he doesn’t go out much, says he’s basically a homebody I guess and just causually hangs with friends hangs with u, and mentions he has no female friends do u think he had any interest atleast.He wasn’t in any rush to leave and it was getting so late to. I think maybe after he realized I drive almost 50 min from campus on my gps when he was sitting in the car he told me to get home safe when he left but I felt bad because I did hug him the night before and in my mind if he wants to be strictly friends that might’ve not been a good move but I brought it up and he said no no no don’t feel sorry for that I’m just so confused",1,1741457770.0,u_ThrowRA_jess2454,0,1.0,False

TLDR: These are all very good in that I wouldn’t kick any of them out of bed based strictly on performance (burn quality, throw, etc.). Still, as expected there were certainly some standouts based solely on my own preferences.👃For those of you that want more deets, light up a Djarum Black and take a steady drag as you read on.

For the past two months it’s been brrrrr cold ❄️ and I’ve craved cozy. To cope, I’ve done a self-imposed curation of candles with tobacco listed in the brand’s notes. If someone had told me that I’d be madly in love with tobacco at the beginning of my descent into scent I wouldn’t have believed it. I’ve always associated that description with bad JC Penny cologne so I would just pass them over until….

- Ranger Station/Tobac + Musk *sweet pipe tobacco, blue musk, clove, amber*…until I met this candle. I gave it a sniff at a cute little shop while traveling last year, fully expecting to dislike it but then, “Wait, should try this??” Many orders later and this is now my OG. He’s ultra heaaaavy on the clove, rich, deep, sweet-ish (but not cloying), a tidge earthy with the tiniest subtle smoke. Bonus points for a big ol’ throw.

- D.S. & Durga/Breakfast Leipzig *javanese coffee, almond kuchen pastry, tobacco leaf, butter, leather upholstery, fireplace* There are plenty of reviews on this candle, but I’d not smelled it in IRL so I blind bought it specifically to include here. For me, this candle has so many other interesting and delicious components I’m hard-pressed to even put it in the tobacco category. It’s a journey where my nose goes one-by-one through all the notes and back again. I get a huge dose of nutmeg/cinnamon for it not having any spices listed though, so I liken the dessert note more to that of a coffee-cake. Others have mentioned throw issues but mine must’ve been a good batch because I found it above average.

- Diptyque/Narguilé *honey, tobacco leaves, spices* An OG in its own right. If you want to dip your toe into tobacco you won’t be disappointed if you start here. I don’t find it woody or smokey which some would think one (or both) is a requirement if tobacco is mentioned, but I personally don’t miss it. I get carmelized, nutty honey balanced with mellow leather and deep spice. 

- Fvith/DILF *tobacco leaf, madagascar vanilla, wood sap, tonka bean, cocoa, dried fruit* I keep buying more and more Fvith candles (I might do a brand review if anyone is interested. This really delivers the tonka along with some creamy cocoa, so it leans gourmand. There’s a touch of dried wood/smoke element that keeps it balanced though. There’s shades and shadows of similarities to HHC’s Langston, so if you like that you may like this. Unfortunately I only get a faint bit of tart dried fruit on the cold throw and I wish it showed up more during the burn.

- Harlem Candle Co./Speakeasy *cardamom, smoked incense, pimento berry, saffron, licorice, plum blossom, tobacco leaves, palo santo, patchouli, vanilla, dark chocolate* That’salottanotes, folks. Whew. They all work brilliantly together though—somehow safe (vanilla) and complex (licorice & pimento) at the same time. I find it almost peppery with more noticeable smoke, too. Me no likey patchouli, and either all the other notes stomp it out, or it’s just thankfully not in there. I got a pretty decent throw even with just their tin size.

- Maison Louis Marie/No.03 L’Etang Noir *anise, nutmeg, tobacco flower, clove, ginger, vanilla, tonka, benzoin, musk* This has that slightly synthetic waxy-ness, but I like that I can pick out every single listed note. It’s mild but bright due to the ginger and I’d say it’s also on the sweeter side. I’d want to play with burning it alongside something else to add depth.

- La Montaña/Alfredo’s Cafe *black tobacco, coffee, brandy, leather, incense* I get acidic coffee, boozy brandy and dry leather from this, so I do rather enjoy this candle. After a while though, that classic men’s cologne smell creeps in and mostly overtakes. If you like Trudon Ernesto I think you’d find that this is similar, but dare I say better. It’s more complex and interesting.

- Voluspa/Blond Tabac *warm perique tabac, vanilla husk, sandalwood* After not being able to describe exactly what I smell, I had to Gaggle “perique” tobacco. Turns out that type of tobacco in particular is described as “fruity” and then it made sense. I get a smoky citrus and vinegar. It’s one of my mom’s favorites so I buy a case wholesale to dole out to her as gifts and I had one on hand to include here. I personally don’t care for it much myself.

- Roen/Garçon * tobacco, dark rum, cologne, red currant, cardamom* I had high hopes as I really do like Roen for their great value. All of their candles I’ve had have burned perfectly with big throws. If I liked the actual scent of this particular candle more it’d be an easy one to keep around. Dang though, it’s far too heavy on the cologne for my taste though. I get nothing else from it but a blast of generic aftershave. 

- Trudon/Ernesto * bergamot, grapefruit, rhum, oak wood, clove, labdanum, patchouli, tobacco, amber, leather, moss* I know this is an icon for some, but didn’t care for it and I don’t get any tobacco. That labdanum and patchouli are just too overpowering for me. I received the cameo for free and since there *is* tobacco in the notes I included it here, but otherwise I personally wouldn’t put it in this lineup. 

Thanks for reading, I’m always happy to elaborate and hey, would you look at that! The sun’s out today! ☀️

My question is mostly, how important is it to have a matching basket size for the dose?  Or is small variations, like 20g in a 22g basket still perfectly acceptable?

------------

Did you know 50% of people give up on weight loss in the first weeks? That makes me sad. Starting weight loss is like climbing a big hill. It looks easy, but my friend, it can be tough at first. I will tell you why starting is hard. I will also share ways to make it easier. Do not worry, you can do it!

I know many people feel lost when they start. Weight loss can feel like a trick. But I know the secrets. I can show you why you feel this. We will learn about water weight, cravings, and mindset. I will tell you small steps to feel better. Soon, weight loss will not feel like a big fight.

1. Fighting the Urge: Cravings and Withdrawal Symptoms
------------------------------------------------------

When I start eating less, I want sweets badly. You too? The body wants sugar. This is a big problem at first. The body is used to getting sugar all the time. When it does not get sugar, it gets angry. This makes it hard to say no to sweets. Sugar withdrawal is real. I also feel bad when I stop drinking coffee. It is like the body is saying, ""Give me back my sugar and coffee!""

Changing your habits is difficult. It is not just about the body. The mind also wants old foods. Maybe you eat sweets when you are sad. Then, when you are sad and try to eat less, it is harder. The mind is saying, ""Eat sweets, it will help."" This is why the start is very hard. It is a fight with the body and the mind. It’s a big reason for initial weight loss struggles.

2. Metabolic Slowdown and Energy Adaptation
-------------------------------------------

### Initial Impact on Metabolism

When I eat less food, my body gets clever. It thinks, ""Oh no, less food! I must save energy."" So, my body slows down. It burns less energy than before. This is called metabolic slowdown. When this happens, I feel tired. This is because my body is not using energy fast. Initial weight loss challenges are common.

### Energy Level Imbalance

Because my body is slow, I do not want to do much. I do not want to exercise. I just want to sit. This makes it harder to lose weight. I need energy to move and burn fat. But my body is trying to save energy. This is a problem. It is hard to stick to a diet when I feel tired all the time. The reasons for slow initial weight loss is a metabolic slowdown is a primary culprit.

3. The Psychological Barrier: Mindset and Motivation
----------------------------------------------------

### Impact of Unrealistic Expectations

I see many people think they will lose weight fast. This is not always true. Weight loss takes time. If I think I will lose 10 kilos in one week, I will be sad. When I do not lose that much, I give up. It is important to know weight loss is slow. I must be patient.

### Mental Strategies for Early Success

My mind is very important. I must tell myself, ""I can do this."" I must not be angry at myself when I eat one bad thing. I must keep going. If I think positive, I will have more power. I can walk more if I feel good about myself. So, I must be kind to myself.

4. Dieting ""Perfectionism"" and the All-or-Nothing Mentality
-----------------------------------------------------------

Sometimes, I think I must be perfect. I cannot eat any bad food. If I eat one cookie, I think I have failed. Then, I eat many cookies. This is not good. It is okay to eat a small bad food sometimes. I do not need to be perfect.

It is better to eat healthy most of the time. If I eat one cookie, I can just eat healthy tomorrow. This is better than eating many cookies because I think I failed. I must not give up when I make a small mistake. It is important to find a way to eat healthy that I can do for a long time. A more flexible approach is best to maintain your motivation for weight loss.

5. The Digestive Adjustment Period: Bloating and Constipation
-------------------------------------------------------------

### Gut Microbiome Changes

When I start to eat healthy, I eat more vegetables. Vegetables have fiber. Fiber is good, but it can make my stomach feel funny at first. My stomach has small bugs inside. These bugs are called gut bacteria. When I eat more fiber, the bugs change. This can make me feel bloated.

### Hydration and Electrolyte Balance

It is important to drink more water when I eat more fiber. If I do not drink enough water, I can get constipated. This means it is hard to go to the toilet. I also need to make sure I get enough salt. Salt helps my body keep water. If I do not have enough salt, I can feel weak. So, I must drink water and eat enough salt when I start eating healthy. Watch out for bloating and constipation.

6. Sleep Deprivation and Stress: Exacerbating the Struggle
----------------------------------------------------------

I must sleep well if I want to lose weight. When I do not sleep, my body gets stressed. Stress makes me want to eat bad foods. It also makes my body store fat. This is not good. I must try to sleep at least 7 hours every night. This will help me lose weight.

Stress makes my body make a bad thing called cortisol. Cortisol makes me hungry. It also makes me store fat in my belly. I must find ways to stop stress. I can walk, do yoga, or talk to friends. When I have less stress, it is easier to lose weight. Poor sleep and stress hamper weight loss efforts.

Conclusion
----------

Losing weight at first is hard. I know this. It is normal to feel like giving up. Do not give up! Water weight can trick you. Cravings are strong. Your body slows down. Your mind can play tricks. Your stomach can feel funny. Stress and no sleep make it harder.

These problems do not last forever. They will get easier. You can do small things to help. Drink water. Eat more vegetables. Sleep well. Talk to friends. Be kind to yourself. You can lose weight. I believe in you. Share your journey with others and explore more information on how to manage your health.

But as time has gone on I've found I've consistently enjoyed their event gamemodes more than the actual base game, ESPECIALLY 2v8. I love it so much and when it's come out I'm constantly playing it for hours on end. 
2v8's been gone for a couple days now, and i've just reopened the game to play some 1v4. I'm only 2 games in and during both games i've been slugged on the ground and left there. During the second game i was left on the ground for so long that i got up to grab myself a cup of coffee then after finally being killed i watched the killer knockdown the last survivour, do the movement we allllll know killers love to do when they've knocked you, bring the last survivour to the hatch and let him crawl to it making it seem like he's going to let him out, just to close it right in front of Dwights face and then killed him. Ya i think im done. 

I can't sit here and act like im some great player because i know im not, again, im a casual and solo, anyone I used to play with stopped playing this game for how unbalanced they thought the game was. The extra event gamemodes are FUN while regular 1v4 is not. It makes me sad that i've only played 2 games and i have NO desire to continue playing. 

I know plenty of others feel the same and have expressed that on here, I know im beating a dead horse. But i dunno.... it just makes me sad because i know 1v4 could be SO fun but it's just not quite there. Peace out, ill see everyone when 2v8 comes back. <3",0,1741457396.0,deadbydaylight,14,0.44,False
