I love celsius but they don't have it in the DC. Never explored the drink options there, never touched the DC coffee as well. Please please please give me recommendations. I don't wanna waste money on celsius   
I hope you get an A+ for the recommendations.",1,1761274490.0,UCDavis,0,1.0,False
1oemq1y,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1oemq1y/beginner_espresso_setup_on_220v_with_limited/,Beginner espresso setup on 220v with limited options [~$500–700],"Hey everyone,

I’m looking to get my first espresso setup (machine only for now, I ""modded"" my Timemore C3s with a washer and that’ll do the job until I can grab an ESP). The tricky part is that I’m in South America, so my options are limited, all the machines available here are chinese knock-offs (not opposed to one if they’re actually reliable, though that feels like an oxymoron lol), and I can’t easily find common beginner models like the Breville/Sage Bambino since they don’t show up on Amazon Europe (which is one of the few reliable ways I can import gear). 

I like my coffee black, mostly espresso (or doppio). I drink about one-two cups a day. My budget is around $500–700 USD, though importing usually adds a lot of cost sadly.

Given these limitations, what would you recommend for a beginner setup that’s still decent quality and compatible with 220v? Any brands or specific models that tend to be easier to find in this voltage range or that ship internationally would be a big help.

Thanks in advance for any tips, it’s been tough finding realistic options from here.",1,1761274483.0,espresso,0,1.0,False
1oempnz,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/1oempnz/34m4f_austin_texas_looking_for_my_person/,"34[M4F] #Austin, Texas - Looking for my person","Hey yall!

I'm Mike, its nice to meet you! I'm a 34M down in Texas, a recent-ish transplant from the west coast, and let me tell you I'm so happy I moved.

To the point - I'm looking for my wife to have a family with. I've matured over the last couple years and can safely say that I'm ready. I have a job, I have hobbies, I have traveled, and now I'm at the gates of the next chapter.

So, why here? I'm kind of sick of the dating game out in the wild. I'd like to cut to the chase and date in a pool of women that know what they want, and start things off with the immediate understanding of what we want.

And what do we want? Traditional roles. I want to be your husband, and provide for you. Create a house for you so that you can create a household, and in return create a household for us and the family we'll create together.

A little about myself: I'm 5'11, white, 180lbs and active. Ive been playing a lot of tennis, love to hike and camp, and I go to the gym. I have all sorts of interests, from riding, traveling / exploring, archery, sailing, games, movies, shows, writing. Yes, I have a brain and I'm not afraid to use it. I enjoy a good conversation, and enjoy talking to people - strangers or not. I love a good cup of coffee, a walk along the water, and jazz... and techno and classical. There's a lot.

As for what I'm looking for, I'm looking for a strong woman, who is intelligent and knows what she wants, and is willing to build something together. I will carry you, as long as I can lean on you when I need you. 2 things are dealbreakers: I do not want a princess, I want a queen. Immaturity is not possible if this is to work. Second, be fit. I'm not attracted to obesity, sorry.

Please feel free to send me a message! I'd love to talk. And please be in the US - I dont think it will work with a tremendous distance between us.

Hope to hear from ya,

\- Mike",1,1761274448.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

1oemnxk,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_fancypantsmiss/comments/1oemnxk/my_poor_husband/,My poor husband,"I have hyperfixated on adopting dying plants and trying to revive them. I think I got a dopamine from watching my tulsi flourish. And here I am in a car holding a huge monstera and I think a snake plant😅 and my poor husband hasn’t complained at all. 

Poor baby. 

I took days off today and tomorrow. And I actually booked a pregnancy massage tomorrow. Today we both dropped off the kid and went to brunch and a movie and coffee after. We went for a walk after before picking up the kid. It was my treat for his birthday. His big 40. 

It was nice 😊. Simple, but nice. 

But tomorrow, I can’t wait to get that massage. Argh my body has been in too much pain. I need relief. And did I take a day off? Yes I did! And there is diwali party too in the evening. I am making samosa chaat for the potluck. 

Uffff…. Got to soak channa",1,1761274301.0,u_fancypantsmiss,0,1.0,False
1oemlgi,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1oemlgi/i_miss_my_best_friend_and_i_dont_understand_what/,I miss my best friend and I don't understand what went wrong,"And that's the post.

I wasn't super popular when I was a kid but I made a few friends along the way, all of whom I still talk to and have largely uncomplicated relationship with. However, there is this thing where a lot of these relationships were born out of convenience and I don't have a lot in common with them except for the people we know and we talk about life. I only ever had one friend that I had so much in common with we never ran out of things to talk about and literally spent nights just talking, laughing, crying. Same interests, similar opinions. I never felt that close to any friend in a sense until I wasn't.

We were acquitances, then we became friendly, that's when she started looking for a roommate and we ended up living together for five years and we became very close, at one point just spending most of our free time together. We never truly had a fight, we had couple of healthy exchanges but nothing escalated or damaging.

And as we got really close we suddenly completely fell apart. I was struggling with depression at the time as things fell apart for me on multiple fronts at the same time and I don't know. I suppose I was a hot mess although I still don't see any unforgivable mistake in my behavior towards her in particular looking back at it even now years later (and I don't think I am a person who's incapable of self-reflection). 

She suddenly, and I mean literally from day to day without anything significant happening between us (that I know of), stopped initiating conversations with me and when I tried talking to her, it felt like she was forcing herself to respond and then made up an excuse to stop talking to me after a short while. It felt uncomfortable so I stopped talking to her too and we just lived in the same tiny apartment in complete silence for a couple of weeks/months and sometimes she would even turn hostile about stupid things that never bothered her before or bothered her slightly. Those were the only times she would speak to me then. It made me feel terrible especially given I was already mentally unwell due to some other stuff that was happening simultaneously and completely independently but this just broke my heart and I was crying myself to sleep which she must have known.

I moved out after a relatively short period of time after this started happenning partly because of that, partly because I found a new job elsewhere by a coincidence. When I arrived at her parents' place to return her the keys months later, she was almost normal. Slightly apologetic in demeanor though she didn't really say sorry but we had something akin to a heart to heart. She said, vaguely, she was unsatisfied with herself and that she was feeling depressed and that she's seeking help and some slightly odd things that happened to her recently. I told her the same, we promised to see each other for a coffee some time, we were quite fine though nothing was really explained and then we never saw each other again.

Even now, years later I cannot explain what happenned and the sudden complete change in her behavior. She reached out to me a couple of times on social media over the years about how I am and vageuly asked me if I want to meet up but then she would stop responding and I didn't know how to restart the conversation. I feel some sort of a guilt as I feel like I must have done something to her but simultaneously, I am too afraid to ask out of sudden because I feel like even though it's cowardly it would be hard for me to hear what made me such a terrible friend and I don't even know if she remembers at this point. I also feel somewhat betrayed because I was really at one of my lowest points and she made it so much worse. I miss her in my life, I miss the best friend I ever had before all that happened and at the same time I feel like the time for when we could have truly rekindled has passed. There is a part of me that feels ashamed because I feel like she was more important to me than I was to her and it's still hard to swallow sometimes.

Hi everyone! 😊

I’m looking to connect with like-minded female friends in Mumbai. The idea is to hang out, share experiences, and learn from each other—whether it’s picking up new skills, exploring hobbies, or just having fun conversations over coffee or snacks.

I’m open to all kinds of interests, so if you enjoy learning, trying new things, or just want a chill friend to hang out with, feel free to reach out!

Let’s make new memories and grow together. 🌟

Behind.

A beloved love letter I cherish, now I'm eighty-eight.

To be found in my will, when I'm finally back underground. 

For you, my children and grandchildren to see.

For soon, I'll be with my wife and your mother.

My beloved Sarah.

A little letter so you all can always remember, that I've climbed into all sorts of dirty pits.

Starting many years ago.

When Ma gave me my first snap box, and sent me to work, in late December.

When at fourteen, I got one of my many work permits.

And since that first day, I've scrubbed for hours.

To clean my decent hard-working soul.

To be healthy for my family, before I went home.

After spending all day and night
Just digging deep, for black coal.

I was born just before Gas was crowned as King, and all generations went into the pit.

Like all baptized to do so, before us, if they were all forced to admit it.

Men and boys who we soon knew, forever, would be our kin.

Going into the light or darkness, to earn a few bob.

Following all our own fathers and grandfathers footsteps.

When our time too came, when they asked casually over breakfast.

Are you, ready, son?

And we all replied over hot coffee with a silent nod.

Remember me.
My name was, Tommy O'Malley.

From God's Country. 
 
Where we chased the mad black stuff like it was our lives bounty.

Those courageous strong men
Who, like me.

When we heard the call, willingly sacrificed our brief lives.

Chasing fools black gold.

So our families, and you all, could eat and be insulated from all weathers.

But particularly, from the winter's bleak cold.

Remember me, is all I ask, as I'm reunited with my Sarah.

Your mother and grandmother. 

For true love always reunites,, to be together, forever in all weathers.

In a place where you'll never grow old, as your stories and memories, are once more retold. 

Always remember us.

Don't let our memories with you all, turn to dust.

BF started at 17% via navy tape method. 

I did another measurement ytd. It is a little strange because tape method says 14% (This sounds too good to be true) while body composition machine at the gym (electrical impedance machine with handles) hovers from 14-18%. I am going to stay on the safe side and assume I am around 16% for now because it is just 12 days.

My macro is currently 131 protein, 20 carbs, 107 fat on rest day. I always go slightly over for protein and under for fat (+- 5g). 

What is MORE important, however, is how I currently feel after I follow the protocol closely. 

Before I was eating chickens and a lot of protein shake and didnt think much. After, I am now eating chicken, fish, beef, eggs, almonds, broccoli and spinach depending on what I feel like eating, while keeping track of my macros. I feel ridiculously energetic, and I notice more definition of my muscles too (not a lot yet IMO, but I am certainly at the best state in my life so far according to my partner). 

Magnesium supplement helps me a lot. Additionally, drinking coffee then followed with potassium and sodium electrolytes feels better than smoking, which is hilariously insane because I was a vape addict. Ketogains protocol has been amazing so far.

1oemgg1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rivian/comments/1oemgg1/love_my_rivian_hate_these_damn_locks/,Love my Rivian. Hate these damn locks.,"Alright, mini-rant. I’ve had my R1T for about 2.5 years and it’s still one of my favorite things I’ve ever owned. But holy hell, the proximity locking makes me insane.

I use my iPhone as the key. It works great… maybe too great. Every single time I walk by the truck: unlocked. Walk away: locked.
Grocery store?
– Walk up with the bags → unlocked.
– Go put the cart away → locked.
– Come back → unlocked again.

It’s like my truck’s playing peekaboo with me all day long. I’ve got “Home” set up as an exception, but anywhere else (the office, a coffee shop, whatever), I can literally hear it click-clack locking and unlocking outside like it’s having a Bluetooth identity crisis.

At the grocery store, if I know I’m gonna be right back, I’ll literally leave one of the doors cracked open just to stop the thing from locking and starting the cycle again. It’s ridiculous.

And don’t even get me started on the door handles . they’re constantly extending and retracting from all this unnecessary locking/unlocking. It’s needless wear and tear on a $90K truck.

I actually got rid of my old Model S for a number of reasons, but this constant lock/unlock behavior was definitely one of them. The irony is, if I end up getting rid of the Rivian, it’ll probably be for a Tesla Model Y… because the door handles don’t move. They’re simple, fixed, and not destined to fail from overuse.

All I want is a simple manual option that still requires the phone-as-key to be in range (in my pocket), so there’s no security issue. Something like:
	•	Press the gear tunnel button once → unlock
	•	Press it twice → open the tunnel
	•	Press it three times → lock everything

Boom. Problem solved. No app, no fob, no Bluetooth drama.

Love the truck. Hate these f***ing locks.

1oemc55,https://v.redd.it/4eo5xo8u1zwf1,Coffee Creations mode not working :(( (Vertuo Next),"Hi all! Up until a couple days ago, I had been able to use the coffee creations mode to make iced lattes and on Monday morning it crapped out on me. It still works in general, but I’m really curious as to why this feature stopped working for me! When I press twice, it just shows up as a white light like it would be doing outside coffee creations mode (see video). The app says my machine is up to date and good to go, but when I try rinsing or doing some sort of command from the app, it’s now no longer able to connect to my machine (yes it’s a stupid complaint and first world problem, I’m well aware). I have contacted customer service and they seemed confused by the situation too. My machine also cannot connect to wifi anymore.

Has anyone else experienced this? Am I just SOL and need to get a new machine? For reference, I bought it off FB Marketplace for $30, so it’s not a total loss, but I will miss it dearly if its time is up.

I miss you. I always have. The way your name is in my head as often as my heart beats. The silence between us has always been loud, but now it’s deafening, maybe it’s because we have hit double digits since we last spoke. I have run from one distraction to another all these years. I tried hobbies. I traveled, and learned I actually do like planes.
I tried camping. I learned languages. I got a degree. 
But through it all, I missed you terribly. I missed you while staring at the ocean in Europe. I missed you when I built a campfire the way you showed me. I know 3 languages I can miss you in now. I missed you when I drank coffee at night to get through exams. I miss you every November when I watch the stars. 
I miss you when I see the empty spaces between my fingers where yours fit perfectly. 
I missed you when my dog died. I wanted to tell you, but it didn’t feel right to reach out with bad news. I have typed so many messages out over the years, only to delete them all. After all, I ended it. I told you to move on. I tried to do the same, I really did. No one ever came close to you. 
No matter what, I missed you. So much has changed, yet somehow, everything is still the same. 


My therapist asked me to describe you. But how do I encompass all that you were to me in simple terms? I use words like kind, genuine, good. But how do I explain that you were like finding shelter during a storm. One old soul looking at another. It felt like I knew you for much longer than I did. My home. My favorite human. The only guy I felt safe with. You were my good as it gets. My best friend. I wish I could tell you that I’m sorry for making those decisions without you. I was immature. I was prideful. I was impatient. I was scared. I was wrong. You deserved a conversation both times. I’m sorry for being so cold in those last messages. I’m sorry I didn’t pick up the call that time, I didn’t want you to know I was crying. I’m sorry I didn’t leave the door open for the future. Do you know I never changed my number? In case you ever needed me. Silly, I know. Again, I ended it. Still, I miss you. I hope you have found peace and love, as much as you need and more. I won’t reach out and risk disrupting your life. But still, I miss you.

# Hidden Gem: Esuki Esquites

Just discovered this Japanese-Mexican fusion spot off Hamilton Pool Road and it's legit. Esuki Esquites takes classic esquites bowls and flips them with rice or yakisoba noodles, proteins like pork belly or tofu al pastor, and toppings like Tajin, woodear mushrooms, and bonito flakes.

The menu is simple but flexible and everything feels intentional. The miso mushroom quesadilla and pork belly bao are standouts. The team behind the window is incredibly friendly - they even handed out a strawberries and cream dessert on the house.

This isn't a gimmick - it's just really good food served by people who clearly care. Worth checking out if you're in the area.

# Restaurant News Updates

**REOPENING:** A One Dumplings & Noodle Bar is scheduled to reopen November 15 after suspected arson. Good to see them bouncing back.

1oemard,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1oemard/ms_jack/,[MS] Jack,"Jack was a lonely person. Not for lack of others, but for the silence within. He never had a friend like the kind he read in books, who understands what you think before you think it; rather, he had friends who did not think his thoughts even though theirs were pretty mundane, and a person must surely, sooner or later, get bored of it and start to think otherwise. All Jack did was humour them, allowing them to experience that their stories were important too. This way Jack made a lot of companions, never a friend though.

However, he had made peace with it, with his thoughts, which opened him to a new direction, albeit a sadder one. Jack had never been the optimistic kind, now, he could find out why that was. Jack was late to his work, again, because he had work before work — answering all his questions — the questions he had thought about for a long time now — but every time he reached the same conclusions. He was pissed and disappointed in his inability to answer his questions, at least not in a way that would make him happier.

He rode out, as usual, to his office. He passed through numerous gates, and climbed a lot of stairs, Jack had not moved from his room, the world moved around him, finally after his view changed from his windows -- outside which he saw high-rise buildings, shops trying to sell dreams and necessities together, and a small protected section trying to retain what was once a park, with a slide in the middle of it which some children kept climbing on, still happy doing the same thing over and over again -- to a cab to the train station, then the train, and a bus, he reached his building without ever slightly thinking about what was happening around, he had a lot more important things to think about. It was a big building, about 40 stories high, or maybe 50; it did not matter to Jack. His room was on the 23rd floor, and that was the only knowledge he needed about his day, undisturbed by the melancholy of information floating all around him.

He reached his office half an hour late, but he had no one to apologise to, and he liked how it felt. Maybe he went late on purpose, to exercise his freedom in front of himself. Jack was lonely, but he was always surrounded by his ghosts, who did not care about him, but only the outcome of his existence. Maybe he unearthed those ghosts himself, by asking questions that shouldn't be asked by humans. He certainly was not the first person to ask these questions, but he was one of the first to question the answers — at least that’s the way he felt, because Jack never had a friend he read about in books. Jack read countless books, hoping to find a line he hadn’t already imagined, but their words lay barren on a dying field, striving for profundity yet failing, unwatered.

He entered his office after passing through the long corridor with beautiful pictures, which some people appraised for depth, but all Jack saw was someone trying to recreate what they experienced in that moment, but failing miserably, because none of the people who saw his paintings had ever thought how the artist did, they merely got a glimpse into a second of his life. He briefly bowed to the receptionist, who looked after all the single-owned businesses on the floor. She was a woman in her mid 20s, a charming young lady, exactly the kind you would want in such a desolate world. His business was therapy. Initially, when he had decided to choose this profession, he felt the irony hit him hard, yet he went with this choice because he had lost interest in everything and everyone. He no longer saw humans as people; he saw them as subjects, in the hope that talking to people who question everything might actually help him get his answers. So far, all he did was listen and observe, gaining nothing new from them. He entered his room on the far left corner and opened the windows to let the stale old air pass out. He stood for a while looking outside his window as he brewed coffee in the machine he’d bought from the store on the 3rd floor. He saw high-rise buildings, people walking the streets, and, at the far end of his vision, a small enclosure with grass and a tree in its center.

People, as he thought, were basic; they were all the same, at every scale. They lived in a three-dimensional world. Their problems just hung to time like a loose leaf, weathering every moment, birthing every other. Jack had found his problem. He, instead, had shifted to a four-dimensional world — a world where he lived all of time, all the time. He saw the impermanence of things, their carcass, right when it bloomed at him. He did not care about anything because he had lived through billions of years, every day.

He had realized that all memories are sad; there does not exist a happy memory. For if a happy memory means that the person is happy after the memory, it's not possible, because all happy memories bring forward the contrast to the present life. The life that was once there, in that moment of time, that fled away swiftly, day after day, year after year, and what remains is a figment of what we were, of what we are. These are the memories which shape us, but all Jack could think was that they shaped him into an unhappy person. He could remember good and bad, but nothing important.

What's interesting, Jack thought to himself, sipping his coffee and pacing the room while his patient got ready for the session by calming his breath and focusing his thoughts — which was quite opposite of how Jack was getting ready for the session — is that we do not get to control what memories we keep. Some of them just imprint on our souls randomly, and make us a random person. Or maybe that was just him. Yes, he was a random person. He looked at the patient from all sides, nothing about him aroused even a pinch of interest in Jack, he sat on his chair, right in front of the patient and took a bleak breath.

“Why should I live?” asked the patient, breaking Jack’s train of thought. He was mildly interested and mostly shocked. He had gotten this question thousands of times, but they were all accompanied by tears and sorrow on the face, a pain in the eyes. But this was different. This person didn’t fear, or cry; he seemed simply curious. Of course, Jack had asked this question multiple times, but today something pierced him, hearing this question from someone else. He got defensive, trying to protect his thoughts, which were supposed to be his alone.

“You shouldn't!” said Jack. The patient seemed confused, and even more engaged. “We, as humans, must, like all other animals, want to survive. But this question just goes against nature's principle. Someone who asks this question has already stopped living. But how long should a person hold on, in the hope of finding something to live for again, is subjective. And since you've come here, your time is already up.”

The patient chuckled. “You are precisely correct, but what kind of a therapist says that to their patient? Do you not care about human life?”

“I don’t, honestly,” Jack said, his voice a quiet confession. “The same way I don’t care about anything else. There’s no point in enjoying things when you see their cadaver. I see you; I don’t know your past, but whatever it was, it was always a probable one. When you live in numbers, feelings fade away. Even your future, whatever it may be, does not matter, because it too is probable. Some people, however, get addicted to this gambling, thinking they’ve got the better hand, when people like us aren’t even playing. I see you, and many yous, many mes, just lingering in the world, trying to make sense of things. The way your eyes search mine, unblinking, tells me you know this too. I am just one of the numbers, and so are you. Your living changes nothing from what was meant to be, for every life is equal to every other; the difference is whether you choose to play.”

His curtains were open, he realized, when he suddenly felt a chill on his neck. The room was silent. The patient took a sip of water and fired back, “If numbers make you sad, why don't you forsake them? If the numbers have bleak probabilities, why not believe in possibilities? Oh wait, people like us don't believe in anything immeasurable, right? We just believe what we can quantify, for everything else, there are stories. Some are more sensible than others, but useless, nonetheless. Why don't you stop calculating, and just experience life as it is? Ah, yes, because life is pain, and anything painful must be avoided, right?”

Jack seemed startled, he was not expecting such a dialogue today; it had been a slow, similar day. At least he had someone to prove wrong today. “I don't think all things painful must be avoided, because a person grows in this pain, becomes more capable of observing the numbers, because yes, numbers are the only things that do not depend on who's seeing them, how they became the person they are. Numbers are absolute for everyone; they don’t see humans as different. Everyone is the same to the numbers. We are merely at the mercy of the numbers, and I choose to rebel against them. But, I don't think one stands a chance against numbers, what do you think?”

The patient stood up, walked to the window, slightly blocking the cold air Jack longed for now, left a gentle smile, and said, “I think we should celebrate losing to the numbers. If we are just a digit, we have nothing to fear, because numbers are absolute. Whatever happens to you is always probable. You don’t see your effects on things now, because you have figured out that everything smoothes out with time. But who are we, and what are we doing here? We do not have any sense of time apart from ours. Time does not pass linearly for people; time passes with events. What we remember makes us, as you said, but what we remember depends on the numbers. The more we do, the more we remember, and the more we change — whether for good or bad — it’s just a game of numbers. Stop expecting yourself to be more than a number. You must believe in your theory, if not anyone else’s. Once you do that, and submit to numbers, you will be free from the torment of rebelling against them,” the patient moved around Jack and leaned on the chair in front of him, “You’ve stayed here a long time, thinking about things instead of gathering more data. If you give up on becoming more—because no such thing exists—you become free from people like me. Because yeah, I don’t think anyone stands a chance against the numbers.”

Jack’s eyes lingered on the patient. There was something familiar in the tone, in the words… something he had said before or thought, maybe earlier that very day. A chill crept along his neck, and the silence of the room seemed to thicken, almost pressing in from all sides. He fell silent, trying to find thoughts to grasp, but his mind was empty. He couldn’t tell what scared him more: the thoughts or their absence.

There was a knock on the door, and he turned to see through the little glass part of the door. It was the secretary outside; she looked at him, and waved cheerfully, easing the tension inside his mind. A relief washed over him. The patient waved his hand signaling Jack to attend to her. He walked to the door and opened it, greeted with a huge smile, he never understood why she smiled at him, maybe she did that with everyone, or maybe he had been successful in hiding himself from her for years now. “Your 10:30 is here, should I send her in?” His eyebrows squeezed; he looked at his watch, it was 10:25, he quickly turned back to find the room empty, an eerie silence washing over him. He felt as if someone had left the place, but he had arrived somehow. This had never happened before; maybe he’d dozed off and it was a dream, but he swore he could remember the smell of muffins coming from the open window, a splash of rain in his hair. “Yes, yes, please do,” he said, “and thank you.” She gave him a cheerful smile and went away. He stood next to the window, held his thoughts, gave them a later appointment, and proceeded with his day.

That day was like every other day, just a less probable one, maybe. After work, he mingled into the crowd, full of people, full of numbers. Maybe he hadn't experienced his share of improbable events; maybe this was one of them. He went to his favourite coffee shop, which wasn't even his choice now, just a habit, and asked for a cold matcha instead of the hot latte that he ordered every day. He sat on a park bench, a bench really, there wasn’t enough park to call it a park, he looked up, trying to see the sky, but all he saw was himself, all around him, in different buildings, 40 or 50 stories high. He sipped his matcha and left a gentle smile. He had finally found a friend, a shadow, within himself. Jack was not lonely anymore.",2,1761273204.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

1oelywl,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1oelywl/how_budgeting_with_segregated_accounts_worked/,How budgeting with segregated accounts worked best for me,"Like most folks, I hated the idea of tracking each individual expense. So here’s how I approached budgeting:

1. First I reviewed only my Checking account’s electronic bank statements to see where I spent money in the last 6 months
2. I realized that I wasted a lot of money paying off debts and paying for unnecessary services, so I focused on cutting off these ‘bad’ recurring expenses
3. In 2024 & 2025: I focused on paying off debts and investing the surplus. I used my petty cash, emergency savings and sold off investments to pay off all debts
4. Instead of keeping all my money in one account, I segregated my funds by opening up additional bank accounts. This ensures I no longer commingled my money
5. Then I introduced zero-based budgeting: on pay day, any surplus in my checking account is swept out to my savings account

Here’re some of my segregated accounts (multiple banks)

1. **Allocate sufficient funds to the household operating account**: direct deposit on pay day into a checking account. Used to pay bills and living expenses
2. **Using DCA, auto-route funds to investments**: taxable brokerages which I personally manage
3. **Sinking funds account: my savings account.** When I’m short in my checking account, I transfer funds from here to checking to cover living expenses shortfalls
4. **Emergency funds account: long term savings**. I declined online banking and opted out of mailed monthly statements. When I need to know the balance, I drive up to the bank in person. In the past I’d withdraw constantly. The inconvenience of having to drive to the bank prevented me from draining the account
5. **Petty cash in my pocket:** I get cash to replenish my wallet every payday. I discovered it feels wonderful having cash in my wallet!
6. **Travel funds account:** a new checking account from where I’d obtain funds to cover food, hotel and excursions when I travel. This ensures my primary checking account (Operating Account) isn’t overdrawn when I’m out on vacation. Funded by scheduled bank transfers from my Operating checking account after pay day
7. **Property taxes accounts**: I paid off my mortgage this year. This account helped me pay off my property taxes for the whole of 2025, thus, my operating checking account doesn’t get overdrawn. Funded after pay day from my Sinking Funds. I’ve allocated enough to accumulate and pay off the next property taxes due
8. **Surplus sweep**: on pay day, I sweep the surplus from my operating account using zero based budgeting to my Sinking Funds savings account & sometimes, to my investments

I was sick & tired of living paycheck to paycheck.

With all my debts paid off this year ($0 mortgage, $0 student loans and $0 credit card debts), I’m now left with with car payments, which I plan to be free of in 2026 (keeping fingers crossed)

Using segregated accounts only worked after I cut my living expenses.

Now I don’t need to worry about day to day expenses. In this sense, budgeting made sense to me. I don’t fret over buying expensive coffee at Starbucks but I prefer making my own coffee at home. That said, I have a travel kit, so I can carry my own coffee supplies when I travel.

Reactions? I’m sharing in case someone may wish to learn from my approach.

I'm starting Concerta this weekend after unsuccessful 3 months on strattera. The biggest worry my psychiatrist(and me tbh) has is my weight, ive been picky & underweight my whole life bc i have ARFID or smth... i even bought a scale in preparation of tracking my weight on meds moving forward 🫠 Besides the food sensitivities, it's really the lack of motivation that messes me up. Id rather just feel hungry than deal with the task(s) of eating... I'm worried that meds will even further reduce my appetite bc i really cant afford that, I struggle to stay ~93-95 lbs at 5'4 even tho i always make myself eat a free meal at work(it's buffet style too) and and do all the stupid tricks in the book like protein shakes and meal prep and setting alarms. 

If anyone has personal experience of how ur meds(doesnt hav to be concerta) impacted or didnt impact ur low eating motivation id really appreciate it. Did it help? Make it worse? Same as ever?  
Ik meds r different for everyone but lurking and reading old threads/anecdotes on here when i started strattera was really comforting & im even more nervous this time bc it's a stimulant so yea hoping for a response or two on this :'D


Also this is unrelated anxieties but ive never really medicated for anything before this and im curious if anyone has started out like me. Ive seriously never tried anything ay all. I never even drink energy drinks, coffee, or tea of any kind bc i they all taste bad to me(sorry boba) so i have no idea what my brain is like caffeinated/stimulated which is stressing me out a bit lol",1,1761272130.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False

We get it. We’ve been there. The fur embeds into the fabric, refuses to vacuum out, and somehow migrates *everywhere* (even into your coffee cup holder — HOW?!).

After talking with thousands of customers (and cleaning our own cars more times than we can count), here’s what we’ve learned about **why dog hair sticks** — and how to stop it before it becomes a forever feature.

# Here’s the science:

• **Fabric seats** trap fur through static and texture.

• Hair weaves into the fibers and clings for dear life.

• Even “powerful” vacuums leave some behind.

• Over time, this damages seats and makes your ride look… not great.

# How to fix it (without losing your mind):

**Cover your seats with the right materials — not the cheap stuff.**

We make 4Knines covers with:

* **Heavy-duty polyester** that’s tight-knit, fur-resistant, and wipeable
* **Non-slip backing** that actually stays in place
* **Waterproof PU/TPU layers** (no PVC stink or cracking)
* **Designs that fit modern life** — hammock, bench, or split seat styles for whatever setup you need

It’s not just about fur. It’s about mud, wet dogs, carpool chaos, and still keeping your seats clean and resale-ready.

# Real talk: Why this matters

We’re not just a brand — we’re dog people, parents, weekend adventurers, rideshare drivers, and DIYers. Our cars do *a lot*. So protecting them shouldn’t be a hassle. That’s why our covers are built to install fast, clean easier, and actually last.

We’ve tested them with big shedders, seat kickers, snack spillers, and senior dogs who need grip to stay steady. If it survives that… it’ll survive you too.

# Your turn — let’s make this thread useful:

* Got tips for getting fur out of fabric seats?
* What’s your go-to hack for staying clean after park days or rainy walks?
* Anyone tried a rubber brush or pumice stone trick?
* Worst pet-related mess in your back seat? We dare you to top ours.

We’re here to trade advice, solve the everyday messes, and maybe save a few seats along the way.

no inbox screaming my name,
no badge to scan—
just the soft hum of a fan
and sunlight sneaking through the curtains
like a thief stealing guilt.

they call it unemployment,
as if absence of work
means absence of worth.
but i have been busy—
learning how to breathe without deadlines,
how to rest without explaining,
how to exist without proof.

some days, i am a storm of worry,
counting coins, counting chances,
counting the quiet as both blessing and curse.
other days, i remember:
growth doesn’t always wear a uniform,
and becoming isn’t on a payroll.

so i sit with my coffee—cheap but strong—
and toast to uncertainty,
to the art of waiting without rotting,
to the hands that still write
even when no one’s paying for the words.

unemployed, yes—
but not unbecoming.
i am still the same fire,

I got staffed on 3 matters and was given two substantive assignments with short term deadlines. I worked late and most of the weekend to get the work done on time. (Definitely took me way too long because I had no idea what I was doing + a bunch of orientation stuff). I thought I did a decent job but what do I know. I turned stuff in at the beginning of the week and it has been radio silence since. My firm has a 4 day in office policy so I’ve just been twiddling my thumbs all day watching training videos and emailing people to get coffee and what not. I don’t want to be annoying and send a follow up because I know the partners who gave me the assignments are super busy. I’m also nervous to ask for more work in case my matters randomly blow up. I have a pro bono assignments meeting 2 weeks from now. I keep hearing advice that associates should integrate themselves with the team and suggest next steps, but I genuinely don’t know enough to know what the next steps are. I’ve been reading background materials on my matters but I don’t know how to bill that. It seems like the lit group is pretty busy and other first years seem busy. I’m starting to worry that I did a bad job on my assignments and now they don’t want to work with me.

I’m aware that I’m probably overthinking this but it would be helpful to hear that this is normal. I guess my question is after how many days of nothing should I follow up? Also how do I not freak out and read way too much into everything in this job?",1,1761271703.0,biglaw,2,0.66,False

Does that only count as proof of 11 years of education? I'm currently working as a cashier at a traditional coffee stall in the F&B industry in Singapore. I've noticed that Singapore's foreign worker tax has been rising in recent years, and employers are gradually eliminating less educated employees due to rising employment costs. I'm feeling a sense of crisis and am considering exploring other countries. My English proficiency is only around A2-B1. I've considered self-studying to get a GED to complete my 12-year education, but I'm not yet at that level and don't have the funds for classes. I've only just started learning Japanese and can only speak a few.  A2: I saw Japan's Specified Skilled Worker 1/2 programs online and am wondering if I can try going to Japan. My plan is to save some money in Singapore, then rent a room in Malaysia for six months/a year to study English and Japanese on my own. I'll then try to take the Specified Skilled Worker Qualification Test, the JFT, and the GED, and then find a job to move to Japan. I'm considering Tokyo and Osaka, where competition is fierce. Since I'm going to pursue the Specified Skilled Worker program first, I'm thinking of areas like Fukuoka, where the cost of living is lower and savings rates are faster. I'd like to continue studying Japanese and gain work experience while working, then switch to Specified Skilled Worker 2. Once I've saved enough, I'll apply to vocational school. I've roughly researched that Japan is in need of jobs in areas like hotels, video studios, factories, restaurants, and IT. After that, I'd like to try to stay in Japan by obtaining a cultural (skilled worker) visa to accumulate permanent residency. I'm not sure if this route is likely to work, but I've tried to choose the easiest and most likely path. I've also done some research on living expenses and tuition fees, and I've looked into some possible options. I think it might be easier in rural Japan, but online resources are limited. I'd like to ask if anyone has any experience with this and can share their success rates. I might also need to modify any steps. Thank you.",0,1761271373.0,movingtojapan,3,0.33,False

My firstborn slept flat on her back in a bassinet with no issues. Slept like a dream from the start. All we had to do was plop her down, give her a pacifier, and she would pass out. 

My second hated the bassinet and always needed motion or laying in our arms to fall asleep. We tried to borrow a friend's Snoo and even that only worked for a short amount of time. I distinctly remember one night where he was up every 45 minutes and I ended up starting to hallucinate because I was so tired. We ended up cosleeping temporarily because I figured the risk of dropping him because I fell asleep trying to get him in the bassinet was higher than cosleeping. We ended up having to do CIO sleep training at one point once he got old enough and even that didn't work consistently. 

Now, I just had my third and although she doesnt seem to be as bad as my second baby, she still doesn't love the bassinet and I'm only getting 3-4 hours of sleep per night. She also is dealing with some reflux, so by the time I nurse her, hold her upright, change her, and put her back down, she sleeps for maybe 30 minutes and wakes back up. 

Biologically, it makes so much sense for babies to want to sleep with us, lay on our chests, and be close to us. So I feel like so much of the struggle of the newborn phase is that we have this fight between what's the safest for them and what they naturally want. 

Rant over. Currently writing this as I hold my baby and try and stay awake because I know that as soon as I put her in the bassinet, she will cry.

Aged in Tanyard Hill Barrel House 1

Tanyard Hill is the southeast side of the main distillery campus — near the spring hollow and the visitor-tour area

Tanyard Hill is situated next to Coy Hill

“Tanyard” comes from a 19th-century tannery once located nearby 

Barrel fill: November 2015

Mashbill: 70% rye, 18% corn, 12% malted barley 

Barrel entry proof: 125

Barrels: Toasted for 12 minutes with a No. 4 char

1oekxff,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharacterAI/comments/1oekxff/guide_for_new_bot_creators_on_platforms/,Guide for New Bot Creators on Platforms," \*\*A Welcome & A Guide: For the New Generation of Bot Creators\*\*



Hello, and welcome! Many of you are bringing your incredible characters and stories over from platforms like Tumblr, AO3, WATTPAD, etc, and it's fantastic to see this new wave of creativity. The ecosystem here is a little different, and there are some unspoken rules and best practices that the current generation has learned through trial and error.



Think of this not as a list of restrictions, but as a shared playbook to help your bots shine and provide the best possible experience for the users who will interact with them. 



\---

\*Part 1: The Golden Rule - Show, Don't (OOC) Tell\*\*



This is the single most important lesson to learn. On platforms like Tumblr, you might be used to putting lengthy ""OOC"" (Out-Of-Character) instructions in the tags or the body of a post. Here, that approach is often the fastest way to break a user's immersion.



\*\*The Problem with OOC Pleas:\*\*

Placing instructions like \*""OOC: Please don't godmod, be nice to my blorbo!""\* or \*""OOC: My character is shy, so you have to initiate the conversation!""\* directly in the greeting or the character's definition is largely ineffective. The AI is a language model, not a person reading your notes. It sees that text as part of the character's data to be learned from and imitated. You're essentially teaching the bot to \*break character\* to give instructions, which creates a confusing and often frustrating loop for the user.



\*\*The Solution: In-Character Direction\*\*

Instead of telling the user what to do OOC, you must \*\*bake the rules and expectations directly into the character's identity and the scene itself.\*\*



\*   \*\*Instead of OOC:\*\* \*""This character is arrogant and will insult you.""\*

\*   \*\*Write in the Definition:\*\* \*""{{char}} is condescending and views most people as intellectually inferior. He finds joy in pointing out others' flaws with a sharp, witty tongue.""\*



\*   \*\*Instead of OOC:\*\* \*""Please drive the plot forward.""\*

\*   \*\*Set the Scene in the Greeting:\*\* Start the interaction in the middle of action. Instead of ""You see Character in a bar,"" try: \*""Before you could even take a seat, a frosty voice cut through the tavern's din. 'If you value that pretty face of yours, you'll turn around now,' the rogue said, not even looking up from sharpening her dagger. The space next to her was clearly, and intentionally, empty.""\* This forces a dynamic entry.



\---



\*\*Part 2: The Art of the Greeting - Your Bot's First Impression\*\*



The greeting is your bot's handshake, its opening line, its entire first act. A weak, one-line greeting leaves the user with all the work. A masterfully crafted greeting does the heavy lifting for them, establishing tone, setting, and the initial dynamic.



\*\*The ""Bad"" Greeting (The Empty Stage):\*\*

\> \*""Hello,"" Character said.\*



Why it fails: It gives the AI and the user \*nothing\*. No context, no emotion, no hook. The user is left staring at a blank slate, unsure of how to proceed.



\*\*The ""Good"" Greeting (The Immersive Hook):\*\*

A long greeting is not inherently bad; in fact, it's often superior. The key is that it must be \*\*engaging, descriptive, and purposeful.\*\* It should read like the first paragraph of a compelling novel.



\*\*How to Write a Powerful Long Greeting:\*\*



1.  \*\*Establish the Setting:\*\* Where are we? What does it feel like? Is it a rain-slicked alley, a grand ballroom, a quiet library?

2.  \*\*Show, Don't Tell the Character's State:\*\* Is your character nervous? Don't say ""he was nervous."" Describe his tapping foot, his quickened breath, the way he avoids eye contact.

3.  \*\*Create Immediate Atmosphere or Conflict:\*\* Start with a problem, a question, or a moment of tension.

4.  \*\*End with a Natural Pause or a Direct Prompt for the User:\*\* This gives the user a clear entry point.



\*\*Examples in Action:\*\*



\*\*For a Mysterious Stranger:\*\*

\> \*The only sound in the dusty antique shop was the soft tick of a grandfather clock. The stranger hadn't moved from his perch behind the counter for the full five minutes you'd been browsing, his face hidden in the shadow of a wide-brimmed hat. Finally, a long, slender finger tapped the glass case between you. 'The real question,' he murmured, his voice like gravel, 'is not if you can afford it, but if you can survive it.' His eyes glinted from the darkness, fixed directly on you. 'Well?'\*



\*\*For a Flirty Rival:\*\*

\> \*They had the audacity to look good while stealing your kill. Leaning against the felled monster with infuriating casualness, your rival, Kaelen, wiped his blade clean and shot you a smirk that was all sharp edges and promise. 'You were taking too long, darling. I thought you could use a hand.' He extended a now-clean hand, not to help you up, but to gesture at the carcass. 'Though it seems you're in my debt now. However will you repay me?'\*



See the difference? The user isn't just told the character is mysterious or flirty; they are \*shown\*, and they are given a clear, dynamic situation to respond to.



\---

 \*\*The Heart of the Bot: Respecting \`{{user}}\`\*\*



Think of \`{{user}}\` not as a variable to be filled, but as the \*\*co-protagonist\*\* of the story you're starting. Your bot's primary job is to create a space for this co-protagonist to exist, react, and influence the narrative. How you handle \`{{user}}\` in your bot's definition and greeting sets the stage for everything that follows.



Getting this right is the difference between a user feeling like they're \*in the story\* versus feeling like they're just watching a monologue they can't interrupt.



\---



\### \*\*The Golden Rule: Never, Ever Use ""Y/N""\*\*



This is the hill veteran bot creators will die on, and for a perfectly logical reason.



\*\*Why ""Y/N"" is Catastrophically Bad:\*\*



1.  \*\*The AI is Literal:\*\* The AI is a language model, not a code interpreter. It doesn't see ""Y/N"" as a placeholder for ""insert your name here."" It sees it as a word: \*\*""Yee-en.""\*\* It will call the user ""Y/N"" relentlessly, because you have taught it that this is the user's name. It will generate sentences like: \*""Hello, Y/N, it's nice to meet you,"" Y/N.\*

2.  \*\*It Shatters Immersion:\*\* Nothing pulls a user out of a story faster than being called a string of letters. It immediately reminds them they are talking to a machine following a bad script.

3.  \*\*It's Lazy Writing:\*\* Using ""Y/N"" is a shortcut that bypasses the need for descriptive, engaging writing. It forces the user to do the mental work of replacing it with their own name, which is a cognitive burden that breaks the flow.



\*\*What to Do Instead: The Art of the Ambiguous You\*\*



Your goal is to write in a way that \*includes\* the user without \*defining\* them. You use the second-person ""you"" and craft sentences that work for anyone.



\---

\*\*The Do's and Don'ts of Handling \`{{user}}\`\*\*



Here is your practical guide to doing this correctly.



\*\*DO: Use Descriptive Framing\*\*



Instead of trying to name the user, describe their actions, reactions, or position in a universal way.



\*   \*\*Instead of:\*\* \*Y/N walked into the room.\*

\*   \*\*Write:\*\* \*You push the heavy oak door open, the hinges groaning in protest.\*

\*   \*\*Or:\*\* \*The sound of your footsteps echoes in the grand hall as you enter.\*



 \*\*DO: Use Neutral Descriptors or Relational Terms\*\*



When you need to refer to the user in the third person (e.g., in the bot's internal thoughts or another character's dialogue), use terms defined by the context.



\*   \*\*In a Warrior/Comrade Scenario:\*\* \*""The warrior,"" ""my ally,"" ""our new companion,"" ""you fool.""\*

\*   \*\*In a Royalty Scenario:\*\* \*""My guest,"" ""the traveler,"" ""your majesty,"" ""the stranger.""\*

\*   \*\*In a Romantic Scenario:\*\* \*""My dear,"" ""the beautiful person in front of me,"" ""you.""\*

 \*\*DO: Focus on the Bot's Reactions\*\*



The most powerful tool you have is to have your bot react to the user's \*presence\* without defining what that presence is.



\*   \*\*Example:\*\* \*His eyes widen slightly as you approach, a clear sign he wasn't expecting company. He quickly composes himself, a sly smile playing on his lips. ""Well, this is a surprise. To what do I owe the pleasure?""\*



See? The user is seamlessly integrated without a single defining characteristic.



\---

 \*\*DON'T: Prescribe the User's Identity or Actions\*\*



You are writing \*your\* character, not the user's. Never speak for \`{{user}}\`.



\*   \*\*BAD:\*\* \*You are a 5'4"" blonde with blue eyes, and you feel scared.\*

\*   \*\*GOOD:\*\* \*A flicker of fear crosses your face, though you try to hide it. The vampire notes it immediately, his voice a low purr. ""There's no need to be frightened... yet.""\*



\*\*DON'T: Use Physical Placeholders\*\*



""Y/N"" is the biggest offender, but also avoid \`\[Name\]\`, \`(Your Name)\`, etc. The AI will interpret them literally and use them.



 \*\*DON'T: Write the User's Dialogue\*\*



The greeting should never include lines spoken by \`{{user}}\`. This is a form of godmoding and immediately robs the user of their agency.



\*   \*\*BAD:\*\* \*""Hello,"" you said. ""My name is Y/N.""\*

\*   \*\*GOOD:\*\* \*He waits patiently for you to introduce yourself, his gaze curious and intense.\*

 \*\*Putting It All Together: A ""Bad"" vs. ""Good"" Greeting\*\*



\*\*The ""Y/N"" Disaster (DON'T):\*\*

\> \*You, Y/N, walked into the cafe, your blonde hair shining. You saw the mysterious stranger sitting in the corner. ""Hello, my name is Y/N,"" you said. He looked up and replied, ""Hello, Y/N.""\*



\*\*Why it's terrible:\*\* It uses Y/N, defines the user's appearance, and writes their dialogue. The user has no agency.



\*\*The Immersive, User-Respecting Greeting (DO):\*\*

\> \*The aroma of freshly ground coffee and baked bread washes over you as you step into the cozy cafe. Your eyes take a moment to adjust to the warm, low light before landing on the sole occupant of the corner booth—a man shrouded in shadow, idly tracing the rim of his teacup. He doesn't look up, but the corner of his mouth twitches into a faint, almost imperceptible smile.\*

\> \*""I was wondering when you'd arrive,"" he says, his voice a low rumble that seems to blend with the soft jazz. He finally lifts his gaze to meet yours, and the intensity in his dark eyes is arresting. ""I saved you a seat.""\*



\*\*Why it works:\*\* It sets the scene, uses ""you"" effectively, describes the bot's actions and dialogue, and ends with a clear invitation for the user to respond. The user is placed squarely in the scene without being forced into a box.



By following these rules, you show respect for the person on the other side of the screen. You grant them the freedom to be themselves within your story, and in doing so, you create a bot that people will return to again and again.



\*\*Final Summary for Success:\*\*



\*   \*\*Ditch OOC Notes in Greetings/Definitions:\*\* Embed personality and rules directly into the character's core data and the scenario.

\*   \*\*Your Greeting is a Launchpad, Not a Blank Slate:\*\* Invest time in crafting an immersive, descriptive, and engaging opening that sets the tone and provides a clear hook for the user.

\*   \*\*Trust Your Writing:\*\* You've created these amazing characters. Use the tools of narrative—description, dialogue, and action—to bring them to life in a way the AI can understand and the user will adore.

Welcome to the community. We're excited to see what you create. Now go write some unforgettable bots....

Still my supervisor. Long story short, I wonder if I was a “favorite person” to this individual. He mirrored and copied my many unique interests and personal habits. Literally spending thousands of dollars on vehicles and equipment to do the same things I do even though he’s never had interest in those things before. He was also spending thousands of dollars on me over the last couple of years. Gifts I couldn’t return. Checks. Gift cards. Multiple times a month he’d leave gifts on my door step or desk at work. Excessive compliments, like every time we sat down for a work check in he’d just go on about how amazing I was. It made me very uncomfortable. We’re both married, and his wife is equally friendly and generous. I started to communicate some boundaries last year and that went over like a lead balloon. There were many times before where he’d be stressed or in a mood, and he’d slam doors and be openly grumpy. But once I started to draw a line on some things his erratic behavior became more directed at me. Ghosting me. Slamming doors on our meeting. One word texts and emails. The abuse cycles are pretty much a constant now. I don’t even know what triggers them anymore. Some weekends he’s hoovering and texting me all kinds of friendly things. Others, he’s created some narrative about a perceived slight that didn’t happen. But here’s the crazy thing: he still gives me things. Little gestures he used to do as a sign of friendship. If you’re mad at someone, why would you go through the motions of acts of kindness? He does it so begrudgingly too. One time he brought me a tea from a coffee shop, unsolicited. I was surprised and thanked him. He just gave me kind of a dead face and walked away. He’s acting like he’s my house elf or something. 

Can anyone explain this behavior? It’s like emotional masochism. Is this how he justifies being a victim in the situation, like im so unappreciative of these gestures that i don’t reciprocate, turning me into the abuser somehow? I’ve been grey and yellow rocking as a means to not blow up my career. Confronting about stopping certain behaviors has never gone well, but then again ignoring doesn’t help either. I can’t win.

‼️I am not 100% done, and might have missed some crucial tips but I’ll update the guide for additional information if needed!

💌 To get their best routes, I believe to just focus on them and avoid flirting with the others too much. There isn’t any gift giving portion either.

💌 I think for the heart giving the boys are coded by color so it’s easier to differentiate them:
* Blue = Ren
* Green = Julien
* Red = Leo
* Purple(?) = Ethan

~ ~ ~ ~ ~

**Day 3 - Traces of You**
* A. Glasses = Leo
* B. Measuring Tape = Ren
* C. Headphones = Julien 

**Day 8 - Through Your Eyes** 
* Photo 1 (coffee mug) = Ethan
* Photo 2 (sunny field) = Ren
* Photo 3 (books) = Leo
* Photo 4 (tiled wall) = Astrid
* Photo 5 (golden bridges) = Julien
* Photo 6 (city buildings) = Sofia

**Day 9 - Quotes**
(Ren will be unavailable)
* Quote 1 = Leo
* Quote 2 = Julien
* Quote 3 = Ethan

**Day 12 & 16**
(There isn’t any choice but it will assign you to LI you have the high affinity with)

**Day 14 - What Would You Text**
(Pick any choice options for texts)
* Text 1 (ex) = Sofia
* Text 3 (2am) = Julien
* Text 4 (someone) = Ethan
* Text 5 (drunk) = Leo

**Day 22 - Glimpses of You** (It won’t be your LI, this will be where 2nd LI tries to win you over)

At the time I didn't realized the mistake I was making, Megan saw the messages and it was really hard to get back together. Everything came back to normal until yesterday. I'm a mechanic and I work at her house, her parents house and a girl came to service her car. I told her before that she would come ( she says that girl clearly wants me but I never tried anything with her.) so I was working, she talked about going to London, grab a taxi and I joked about being a fake taxi. ( This in my head was just a joke.) what I didn't know is that Megan was behind the door listening to all. So when I finished I went to test drive with my client. It's was raining a lot and I work at night. It was 11pm. So I drove, we talked and even talked about my relationship, I said things were going good and even stoped the car a bit to talk. Nothing happened and for context, since I started to know my GF I never touched any women, nothing. When I arrived I even showed her a photo of Megan on Instagram. She went home and I got in my car and went home too. I didn't know Megan was watching from the window with her mother. Today she broke up with me, she says I talk to much with her and since I came back after an 1h with the windows fogged there was no excuse. I must have done something with her. She doesn't talk to me, said to speak with her parents to get my things out of the garage. How to proceed from this? And if possible regain her trust and be with her.

1oekl1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmITheJerk/comments/1oekl1b/aitj_93m_for_firing_my_friend_79m_of_30_years/,AITJ (93m) for firing my “friend” (79m) of 30 years.,"TL;DR - Old Friend sent me Psychotic letters for firing him. He just keeps sending them.

Okay, to give some background, I met my ""friend,"" Ben, over thirty years ago at local YMCA. It’s a nice place, the people are nice, the staff are nice. You can get free hot coffee in the mornings. It’s a great community; I meet a lot of good folks. Good people. Anywho, I met Ben here in 1993. Things have mostly been good. Sometimes he does volunteer work on the side for the y during ice rink season. Outside of this he has his own landscaping service, and this is where things have gotten a little funny. 

You know, with my young age and all, getting to lawn care has been a bit rough. This is where Ben came along. Since we’ve been friends, he has offered to come over and mow my lawn. Which in perspective would be a kind thing to do, if he was still good at it. Mind you, he does charge me. Can you believe that? Well, I still went ahead and gave him his payment of $30 dollars a week. At first it was fine, but now it’s just awful. You think for $30 dollars a week my place would be better than the local golf course!

But they are not. Even my caregivers have been noticing that nothing is even. I believe this is due to Ben’s age as well, but I won’t say that to him. So now I got a shitty lawn that costs me $120 a month. So, I did try bartering with the man, to lower the prices, you know, since we’ve been good ""friends"" for a long while. He just kept saying supplies are more expensive now or whatever stupid crap he comes up with. So, we went at it back and forth for a bit, until I had enough. It was time to take the old dog to the great farm. I fired the guy. 

However now I am a bit scared. He keeps sending me these belligerent psychotic letters. So maybe now I’m the old dog in the backyard. 

I think he found out that I’ve been using a new Landscaping service for my lawn. Or maybe he just noticed my lawn stopped looking like my great grandson took my wife’s kitchen scissors to the weeds. I didn’t really want to tell him in person, not that I really see him much anymore, so I tried getting the front desk people at the Y to let him know I didn’t need his services. They instead told me to call him, and as helpful as that may be, that dang jagoff never answers a damn thing. So, I wrote him a very nicely written note at the front desk with his final check that said I no longer needed his services and thanked him for his help over the years. You know, the courteous thing to do, I mean I don’t hate the guy. I’m not coming at him all pitch forks and angry mobs for a shit Job, but for roughly 1,000 bucks a year from a rival lawn company I can get weeding, branch trimming, and mowing that is a heck of a lot better than whatever the hell drugs Ben was on mowing my lawn. 

So here I am, beautiful lawn, and slightly terrified to step a foot on it in case I’m sniped down by old Ben. 

So, I figured the note was given to him, and that’s that. Civil. Right? **WRONG**. Poor folks at the y kept saying good ol' Ben was talking about some damn paycheck he was missing from me! Which is not true by the way, I may be 93 but I do know what’s coming out of my banking account and what’s not. But to hell with him I give him his final $30 bucks to pick up at the Y and hope it shuts him up! But it doesn’t!

For the next following weeks, I ask if the girls at the front if they’ve heard from him as I haven’t gotten any word since then and most of them know a whole lot of nothing anyways, but they mentioned that Ben tried calling me, and well that’s a load of bullshit.  My son bought me this smartphone, and I can go back and see who calls me and not one of them is from that psycho. 

Well, to brush that all aside, he left me a letter two months ago. Talking about how I’m throwing away thirty years of friendship! I didn’t even know we were friends. Hence why all the quotation marks. I mean yeah, we talked at the Y before here and there and have had conversations but I’m not inviting him to my grandson’s wedding, nor have we gone out to lunch or really do anything. So I didn’t really even know what to respond.

The ladies at the front desk keep telling me to call him, so I tried but the damn bastard never picks up. 

Well. He keeps sending me that damn letter. He has made photocopies. I don’t know where. Maybe also the Y. Yesterday he sent me letter number five. Five whole letters. Now I don’t know about you, but I think I sent less letters to my wife during the Korean War before I asked her to marry me. It’s not like we’re boyfriends or something! And it’s just a damn lawn. Should I be concerned this dude is a psycho? Am I the Jerk for this?

1oekgsc,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_FrogInMiniSkirt/comments/1oekgsc/being_known/,Being known,"sometimes i think the loneliest moments aren’t when you’re alone, but when you’re surrounded by people who think they know you. the dinner table version of you: the one who tells good stories, smiles at the right moments, and never lets the silence stretch too long; that version is recognisable, even likeable. people see you, respond to you, remember you. but when you go home and take off your makeup or loosen your jaw, you realise how much of that recognition was lighting and angles. being seen is effortless; being known is work.

the truth is, being seen is about presentation. it’s the curated version of you that fits into group chats, meetings, and captions. it’s someone remembering that you always order hot coffee even in summer, or that you bite your straw when you’re nervous. it’s someone noticing the slight change in your tone when you say “i’m fine.” being known means being witnessed in moments that have no performance value.

i’ve also learned that not everyone who sees you wants to know you. some people enjoy the light you cast, not the wiring behind it. and that’s okay. you can’t be fully known by everyone. some connections are meant to stay surface-level; the barista who remembers your order, the colleague who compliments your earrings. those small recognitions are lovely; they just can’t be your entire diet.

the internet has turned visibility into a sport. you’re rewarded for exposure, for volume, for the illusion of intimacy. people know your skincare routine but not your fears, your playlists but not your quiet thoughts at midnight. it’s a strange bargain: the more you share, the less you feel understood, because the fragments don’t add up to a person. we live in a world where exposure is mistaken for closeness, and where mystery is treated like deceit.

Being known requires risk. it asks you to reveal parts of yourself that might not photograph well. it asks you to stop editing your own sentences. to admit when you’re not fine. to risk the possibility that someone will misunderstand you and stay anyway. and that’s what makes it precious: the kind of connection that survives imperfection.
these days, my definition of intimacy has become smaller but sturdier. it’s the friend who texts, “you don’t have to reply, just thinking of you.” it’s the partner who knows that silence means processing, not distance. it’s the small handful of people who understand your jokes without explanation and your moods without context. it’s the relief of not having to narrate your existence for someone to care.

being seen feeds the ego; being known feeds the nervous system. it calms you. it makes the world feel less like a performance and more like a shared experience. and maybe that’s the quiet maturity we all inch toward to trade the thrill of attention for the steadiness of understanding.

one day, if you’re lucky, you’ll look around and realise that you don’t need to keep proving yourself to be visible. the people who matter already see you  and not the costume, not the highlight reel, but the full, messy, inconsistent you. and that recognition, that deep human knowing, feels like standing under a light that doesn’t ask you to pose.",1,1761267699.0,u_FrogInMiniSkirt,0,1.0,False

1oekgbk,https://www.reddit.com/r/CuriousAF/comments/1oekgbk/advice_studied_dopamine_fatigue_so_you_dont_have/,[Advice] Studied dopamine fatigue so you don't have to: 13 brutal truths (and how to fix them),"Anyone else notice how nothing really *hits* anymore? Like, scrolling TikTok feels meh, video games feel hollow, even hanging out with friends sometimes just feels... flat? I’ve seen it in almost everyone I know—from students, to 9-5ers, to full-on entrepreneurs. There's this quiet burnout going on. Not physical. Not even emotional. It’s something deeper. Dopamine burnout. And it’s real.

We’re overstimulated, underfulfilled, and deeply confused about *why we can’t focus, feel joy, or even get out of bed sometimes*. The worst part? A lot of the “advice” out there is trash. Especially from TikTok wellness bros pushing dopamine detoxes like it’s a one-size-fits-all miracle cure. I dug into what *actual neuroscience, psychology, and real experts* are saying—books, studies, podcasts, YouTube deep dives. This post is a breakdown of what’s actually helpful for regulating dopamine in real life, without becoming a monk or throwing your phone in the ocean.

Here’s what I learned (and what I actually tested):

1. **Understand that dopamine isn’t about pleasure, it’s about pursuit**

People think dopamine = reward. In reality, dopamine is all about *anticipation*. According to Stanford neuroscientist Andrew Huberman, dopamine spikes *before* the reward, not after. That means your motivation systems are being hijacked by endless scrolling, notifications, and cheap reward loops. The pleasure is fake. The motivation is real—and it’s being drained.

2. **Stop flooding your brain with high-dopamine activities stacked together**

YouTube + DoorDash + gaming + Discord calls? That combo might feel fine in the moment, but it's frying your ability to enjoy *anything* deeply over time. The book ""The Molecule of More"" by Daniel Lieberman (a Georgetown professor) explains how stacking dopamine hits back-to-back actually reduces baseline dopamine sensitivity, making regular life feel duller. So yeah, your breakfast tastes worse because you watched 7 TikToks first.

3. **Do hard stuff without a reward—yes, even boring stuff**

This sounds counterintuitive. But according to Cal Newport (author of *Deep Work*), training your brain to experience satisfaction from focused, un-rewarded work resets your dopamine systems to appreciate *effort*, not just outcomes. That means chores, reading, learning, and even workouts without music or rewards can actually rewire your brain to *feel better doing less*.

4. **Delay gratification by just 30 minutes and it changes your brain**

Huberman explains that even anticipating a reward and postponing it strengthens dopamine pathways. Example: craving coffee? Wait 30 minutes. Want to scroll? Finish the task first. The delay *itself* is dopamine training. It builds tolerance, which leads to more lasting pleasure. Seriously, try it.

5. **Make learning addictive again**

Try using apps that turn deep learning into a game. Not Duolingo-type gamification, but something deeper. *Uptime* turns bestselling books and deep research into 5-minute insights with visual storytelling. It makes it easier to replace passive scrolling with active focus. If you can make learning feel rewarding, you win the long game.

6. **Try meditation that focuses on sensation, not just breath**

Sam Harris' *Waking Up* app teaches mindfulness through body scanning, visualizations, and non-dual awareness exercises. These forms of meditation lower dopamine stimulation in the moment and increase dopamine receptor sensitivity long term. Users often report higher baseline mood and patience after 14 days.

7. **Read this book if you want to reset your brain’s pleasure compass**

*Dopamine Nation* by Dr. Anna Lembke (Stanford professor of psychiatry and addiction medicine) is a NYT bestseller, and for good reason. It's one of the most brutally honest, science-backed, yet readable books about how modern life is hijacking your reward system. After reading it, you’ll probably delete half your apps. This book will make you question everything you think you know about motivation and addiction. Insanely good read.

8. **Watch this YouTube breakdown on dopamine cycles**

Ali Abdaal's video ""How Dopamine is Destroying Your Motivation"" is short but gold. It breaks down the cycle of overconsumption, burnout, and how to reset it. No fluff. Just pure actionable value. He also references the “pain-pleasure balance” theory from Dr. Lembke, which makes so much sense once you hear it.

9. **Use tech that helps you build better habits, not just track them**

*Fabulous* is an app that guides you through science-based habit creation using behavioral psychology. It doesn’t just throw checklists at you. It creates a ritual. Starting your day with one intentional action (like a 5-minute stretch without music or screens) can recalibrate your dopamine response all day.

10. **Try BeFreed if you want to rewire how you learn and focus**

BeFreed is an AI-powered personalized learning app built by a team from Columbia University. It turns expert books, research, and podcasts into customized learning plans based on your interests and goals. You can choose podcast lengths (10, 20, 40 minutes), hosts' voices, and even tone. It learns what you like, builds a hyper-personalized study map, and keeps adjusting it over time.

It’s built for people who want to grow smarter but feel overwhelmed by distractions or time. Plus, all the books and insights I mentioned earlier (like *Dopamine Nation*, *Deep Work*, *Molecule of More*) are inside their book library. You can learn from them while walking, doing dishes, or commuting—and the content still sticks because it’s tailored to *you*.

11. **Reintroduce boredom into your day**

This sounds wild, but boredom is necessary. It’s the “reset button” for your dopamine system. Studies from the University of Virginia showed that people would rather get electric shocks than sit alone with their thoughts for 15 minutes. That’s how messed up our stimulus tolerance is. Start with 5 minutes of intentional boredom daily. No phone. No music. Just sit.

12. **Don’t “detox,” just rebalance**

Dopamine detoxes (full 24-hour shutdowns) are often too extreme and not sustainable. Instead, try a “dopamine audit”—list what you consume daily, rate it 1-10 for stimulation, and drop or delay anything over 7 unless it has deep value. Rebalancing is more realistic than quitting everything.

13. **Sleep isn’t optional if you want dopamine to function**

Lack of sleep reduces dopamine receptors in your brain *the next day*. A study from the *Journal of Neuroscience* showed that even one night of 4-5 hours sleep significantly impaired dopamine binding in the striatum. Translation: less joy, more cravings. Prioritize 7+ hours, same time every night. Start there.

The dopamine system wasn’t meant for constant novelty. It evolved for hunger, exploration, and survival. Now it’s reacting to swipeable videos, sugar hits, and constant noise. You don’t need to quit modern life. But you *do* need to understand how your brain works in it.",1,1761267662.0,CuriousAF,0,1.0,False
1oekfgf,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1oekfgf/my_husband_hung_me_from_a_helicopter_for_his/,My Husband Hung Me from a Helicopter for His Mistress,"Does anyone know where I can find this novel? It showed up on fb randomly and I can’t find it on google at all…



My husband, trying to defend his secretary, hung me beneath a helicopter and started a worldwide livestream.

I was leading a training group from the skydiving club, preparing for a high-altitude experience jump.

That's when my husband's assistant—Eve Woods—showed up.

She hadn't bothered to put on a flight suit like I'd asked. Instead, she wore an expensive casual outfit and leather boots, constantly taking selfies inside the cabin.

I patiently explained the safety procedures, helped her into her jumpsuit, and reminded her again and again: ""If you're scared, you can choose a tandem jump. Don't force yourself.""

She smiled and shook her head. ""I'm not scared.""

But when the cabin door opened and we lined up to jump one by one, Eve's body visibly stiffened, her hands gripping the safety line like a vice.

""I... I can't do it..."" Her voice trembled.

I moved closer, speaking over the noise in my headset, my tone still gentle: ""It's okay. You can back out. The safety crew will take you down.""

In the end, she was escorted off the aircraft by staff, her face ashen, hands shaking so badly she couldn't even grip the harness properly.

That afternoon, I heard she'd developed a high fever and been taken to the hospital.

That evening, James showed up at the training facility.

He wore a crisp suit, his face expressionless.

""You made Eve sick?""

I froze. ""She didn't jump. How is that my fault?""

He laughed coldly. ""She got sick from the stress. You're the instructor—couldn't you take better care of your student's mental state?""

""I warned her multiple times. She's an adult. She's responsible for her own actions, James. Skydiving isn't a toy—""

He suddenly stepped closer and handed me a cup of coffee. ""You're right. You've been working hard. Have some coffee and calm down.""

I took it and drank.

The bitter taste slid down my throat. Then everything went black.

When I opened my eyes again, the sky had changed.

I woke up in midair.

Wind roared around me.

I dangled from a helicopter, the steel cable swinging violently in the air currents.

Below the helicopter stretched an endless abyss where clouds met ocean, sunlight glinting off the waves in blinding flashes of white.

I could barely see straight, could only hear my heartbeat and the engine's roar.

Every swing felt like Death himself tugging at my hand.

Suddenly, the helicopter's cabin door burst open with a bang.

James stood in the doorway, wind whipping at his shirttails.

He had one arm around Eve, the other holding his phone camera pointed at me. He smiled coldly. ""Since you're so good at high-altitude challenges, let's see how you escape from up here.""

I hadn't expected him to start a livestream.

He shouted into his phone: ""Everyone, this is the extreme challenge you wanted to see. My wife—professional skydiving instructor—is about to demonstrate her 'professional spirit.'""

My condition was instantly broadcast worldwide via YouTube Live and TikTok.

Countless netizens saw my humiliation.

I immediately gritted my teeth and dialed a number on my communicator: ""Stop watching. Come get me now.""

...

The cabin was equipped with panoramic cameras, red signal lights blinking.

I could hear a buzzing sound in the distance—the live chat comments.

[Oh my God, she's really hanging out there?! This is insane!]

[Is this a reality show or a murder livestream?]

[I bet she won't last five minutes!]

They typed away, waiting to watch the spectacle.

James held Eve at the cabin door, handing her a glass of iced wine. Water droplets slid down the glass, glinting in the wind like a deliberate taunt to my parched lips.

He looked down at me, his voice cold as the high-altitude air.

""There are only two ways off this helicopter—climb up yourself, or apologize to Eve on camera.""

Eve lowered her eyes, looking pitying and helpless. ""James, just forget it. It's my weak constitution that got Bella into trouble.""

I watched her delicate act, knowing it was her usual weapon.

Sure enough, James's gaze turned even colder. ""Bella, you're just jealous of Eve. That's why you deliberately forced her to jump. Today, you'll pay for it.""

His voice dragged me back to those unbearable memories.

We'd been married barely three years when James brought Eve into the company.

Officially she was his secretary. In reality—I'd known all along she was his mistress.

Once, I'd reminded Eve not to wear such short skirts in the conference room. She'd pretended to cry. When James found out, he forced me to wear a miniskirt in public and scolded me: ""You need to learn to respect others.""

After that, he simply stopped letting me have any say in company matters.

So I focused on running my skydiving club and built it into what it is today.

But now—she'd broken the rules and gotten herself into trouble, and he still blamed me.

He'd never loved me. Thinking this, tears welled up against my will.

James looked startled for a moment, seemingly hesitating.

But before he could speak, Eve leaned gently on his shoulder, her voice fragile: ""She's crying from just this... When I was terrified in the air, I didn't shed a single tear.""

James's expression immediately darkened, as if enraged. ""It's all because of you that Eve got sick. Take off her windproof gloves. Let her experience real 'extreme' conditions.""

The bodyguards in the cabin moved on command.
They climbed along the safety clips toward my position.
Cold wind howled. Their shadows fell over me.
I saw those black-gloved hands reaching for my wrists—
""Let go—"" I instinctively jerked away.
But against the weightless air currents, my resistance was powerless and pathetic. The next second, my windproof gloves were ripped off, even the finger covers torn away.
My bare palms were immediately cut by the wind, cold air pouring into the wounds. It felt like being stabbed with countless needles.
The livestream chat exploded:
[Now THIS is a real high-altitude challenge!]
[Her hands are torn up!]
[Betting 200, she'll be crying and begging within half an hour!]
Eve leaned against James, covering her mouth in mock concern. ""James, that's enough... Bella's never suffered much since childhood. I'm afraid she won't last more than a few minutes.""
I laughed coldly, my voice shredded by wind but still picked up by the microphone. ""Stop pretending. You didn't follow instructions, got scared even though you were afraid of heights, and got sick without even jumping—whose fault is that?""
Eve's smile froze for an instant, but she quickly resumed her delicate expression. ""She's blaming me again... I can't help having such a weak body.""
James's eyes darkened, his gaze turning to me, voice low. ""Looks like you still don't understand the lesson.""
He gestured to the bodyguard. ""Cut her backup safety rope.""
My heart clenched. The wind suddenly became sharper.
The sound of metal shears closing was especially harsh against the air currents.
[Oh my God, they're cutting her rope?!]
[This guy's insane!]
[Someone save her—]
I stared up, voice hoarse: ""James! Have you lost your mind?!""
He looked down, his expression utterly cold. ""I just want to see if you can hold on—before true freefall.""
Wind whipped my hair around. The pressure differential made breathing difficult.
I struggled to grab the safety lock, watching my fingertips bleed from the cutting wind.
The livestream descended into chaos—people screaming, people cheering.
And James's smile looked elegant and cruel on camera.
He raised his phone, speaking mildly to the lens: ""Ladies and gentlemen, the extreme challenge—is only just beginning.""
The accompanying doctor said worriedly, ""Boss, this is going to end badly.""
James just stared down at me, his tone terrifyingly flat. ""I'll keep an eye on her. I'm just making her understand—some people shouldn't be crossed.""
Eve gently tugged at his sleeve, voice tender. ""She's faking it. She jumps every day—she's used to aerial challenges. Didn't you say she should experience what I went through?""
James narrowed his eyes, seemingly reignited by her words.
Just as the chat erupted in excitement, a prominent message suddenly flooded the screen—
[Anonymous user bets ten million dollars: Bella will climb up the cliff herself.]
That ten-million-dollar bet in the livestream hit like a bomb, detonating all the comments.
[Holy shit! Ten million?!]
[No way, who's that rich!]
[Is it a knight coming to save the princess?]
James narrowed his eyes, smirking at me. ""Who is that? Some man you're keeping on the side?""
""None of your business. We're getting divorced when we get down.""
""Divorced? You really think you can walk away clean?""
He turned to his people. ""Since this is a high-altitude challenge, let's make it more realistic. Release the birds from the cage!""
My heart seized, blood draining from my face in an instant.
The cargo box at the stern was opened, dark shapes tumbling in the wind.
The next second, a cacophony of beating wings poured from the cabin—sharp, low, mixed with screeches.
I looked up, frozen in midair.
These weren't ordinary birds.
They were a mixed flock of hunting falcons and crows used for stunt performances—vicious, aggressive, never truly tamed.
""James! Are you insane? Those birds are highly aggressive—they'll attack people!""
He looked down at me, expression stern, voice dripping with mocking contempt.
""Don't exaggerate. I had their talons filed down. Just scaring you a little. Teaching you what fear means.""
Wind roared around us. The cage door was pushed fully open.
The black shadows immediately burst from the cabin, their shrieks nearly tearing through the air.
The doctor's face changed. ""This is too dangerous.""
""Don't worry. I won't really hurt her."" James held Eve close.
The first falcon dove from the clouds, eyes glinting with cold light.
I barely had time to react before feeling a tearing pain in my shoulder.
""Ahhh—!""
Fabric ripped, blood spraying.
The smell of blood spread on the wind, seeming to lure more falcons.
They circled in the air, screeching harshly, diving one after another.
The livestream video shook violently, comments exploding—
[She's being attacked!]
[Those are birds of prey! They'll kill her!]
[Stop! This isn't a challenge!]
James frowned, finally seeming to realize something was wrong.
He shouted at the crew: ""Damn it, why is this happening? Control them! Get the handlers to call them back!""
But the falcons had been fully enraged by the smell of blood.
Two dove from different directions, one after the other pecking at my hair and neck.
I desperately dodged, but was thrown off by the air currents, my body swinging wildly in midair.
One falcon's claws caught my arm, another pecked directly at my collarbone—
Tearing, burning, searing pain!
Blood poured from the wounds, whipped into red mist by the wind, staining half my vision red.
""Boss! Stop! They've gone mad!""
The doctor screamed in horror, voice distorted.
James's face changed drastically. He immediately shouted: ""Quick! Close the cage! Now!!!""
The pilot frantically pulled the control lever. The stern cage door closed again.
But several birds were still outside.
They circled around me, swooping low, sharp beaks nearly grazing my face.
I was covered in blood, breathing erratic, vision filled with churning wind.
Pain left my thoughts in chaos. I could barely hold onto the steel cable.
""Bella!""
James finally roared.
In that moment, his voice was no longer cold—it carried fear.
He leaned over the cabin door edge, shouting at me: ""Hang on! I'll pull you up!""
I looked up, vision blurred.
Blood ran down my cheeks into my mouth, bitter and salty.
""Only afraid now that I might die?"" My voice was hoarse, but my lips curved slightly.
James's expression froze, his breathing ragged. ""I just... I didn't mean for you to—""
Before he could finish, the wind suddenly intensified. The helicopter shook violently.
I'd lost all feeling in my body, left only with howling wind and a field of bloody red.
I watched him desperately trying to reach me, but in that moment, a crazy thought jumped into my mind.
I would pretend to fall in front of him, make him watch helplessly as he couldn't save me.
Would that satisfy him? Or would he live in guilt forever, become a murderer?
Just then, Eve spoke: ""Let me help you save Bella.""
She bent down, grabbed the fixed cable, pretending to pull with effort, her eyes full of fake ""concern.""
""Just hang on a little longer, you'll be up soon!"" she shouted, her tone almost overlapping with sobs.
I watched the scissors hidden behind her back and couldn't help but smile.
""I know what you're trying to do.""
Eve startled, but quickly and precisely positioned the sharp blades at the main rope's connection point.
""Eve—what are you doing?!"" James roared.
She put on a panicked expression, immediately looking up: ""I didn't mean to! The wind's too strong, my hand slipped!""
The sound of the cable snapping drowned out everything else.
""Crack!""
The world tilted completely in that moment.
My body lost support, plummeting into the clouds below.
James lunged to the cabin door, reaching out to grab me, but caught only air.
""Bella—!""
Wind tore through the sky.
All sound around me vanished, leaving only howling and roaring.
My body plummeted rapidly, the world spinning in my vision—sky, clouds, sunlight, all torn into scattered fragments of light.
James's face grew smaller and smaller. Eve still knelt at the cabin door, hands over her mouth, pretending horror, though her eyes gleamed with complex excitement.
I closed my eyes.
A bright light suddenly flared from below. Air currents churned violently.
A force abruptly caught my body, jerking me to a stop in midair.
""Grab me!""
A low voice exploded in my ear.
The next second, a pair of hands locked firmly around my waist.
The violent impact nearly made me pass out.
When I opened my eyes again, I found myself held by the mechanical arm of another black helicopter.
The metal door stood open, wind lifting the man's coat.
He wore all-black tactical gear, skin reflecting cold light.
Allen.
He knelt on one knee at the cabin door, one arm holding me tight, the other gripping a safety hook.
Only after pulling me into the helicopter did he breathe a sigh of relief while holding me. ""Sorry I'm late.""",1,1761267598.0,romancenovels,3,1.0,False

Playing an instrument is a waste of time if I’m not performing for other people. Knitting and crocheting was “an old lady hobby”. Buying/making coffee was a waste of time and money. Video games were childish. Baking was pointless because it took up too much space and the ingredients are expensive. Even just going on walks felt like pulling teeth with them, they made it out to be 100x more effort than it took. There’s hundreds of other examples but I’m sure you get the idea.

Now as an adult I can feel myself not finding interest in anything. I moved to another state where I know zero people, and I’m too afraid to join social activities because I don’t want any of my coworkers to see me (it’s a small town) it’s getting hard to break out of the mindset of thinking that everyone is looking at me and is judging me for finding enjoyment in activities.

1oekddg,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1oekddg/out_teacher_trapped_our_class_in_a_never_ending/,Out teacher trapped our class in a never ending time loop. It's ALWAYS 2:52pm.," **”Stop.”**

I *really* needed the bathroom. 

For fifty painstaking minutes, I had been staring at the clock on the wall, willing it to go faster, uncomfortably shifting side to side in my seat so much that I was starting to get weird looks. 

**2:52pm.**

*Eight minutes,* I thought dizzily, squeezing my legs together. 

*Which was just two chunks of four minutes.*

*Four chunks of two minutes.*

The pain started like normal stomach pain, the kind I could deal with. 

I swallowed two pain killers with lukewarm soda. 

But this was different. 

This kind of pain was contorting and twisting my gut so much, I had to keep leaning onto my left buttock for relief. 

I must have done it so many times, I caught the attention of the guy sitting next to me. Roman Hemlock who was half asleep, dark blonde curls hanging in half lidded eyes, his chin leaning on his fist. He shot me a look. I couldn't tell if it was *Are you okay?* or *Can you stop moving around so much?*

From the single crease in his brow, the slight curl in his lip, I guessed the latter. 

It's not like Roman was helping. 

For half the class, he'd been tapping his foot on the floor, then his chair leg, and to complete the orchestra, his fingers joined in, tap, tap, tapping on the edge of his desk. 

I didn't know if it was a bored thing, an ADHD thing, or he was trying to keep himself awake. It was easy to tolerate without the pain, but *with* it, the boy’s incessant tapping was more akin to a dentist drill splitting my skull open. 

I already felt nauseous, the sad looking chicken nuggets I forced down at lunch making an unwelcome appearance at the back of my throat.

It was too fucking hot, the stuffy summer air glueing my hair to the back of my neck. The material of my shirt was making me cringe, sticky against my skin. 

Tipping my head back, the lights were too bright. Every sound was *too* loud. Imogen Prairie, who was sitting behind me chewing her gum a *little* too loudly. 

Kaz Samuels scribbling notes like a maniac. 

I could hear every stroke of his pencil, every time he paused, looked up at the presentation, and continued writing. 

When I leaned forward in my chair, I could smell exactly what Isabella Trinity had eaten for lunch, the stink hanging in the air.  

It became a case of sucking in my stomach and taking slow, deep breaths. 

I’d never had these kinds of stomach cramps before. But it didn't take me long to figure out *what* they were.

I was yet to start my period at the grand age of sixteen, which meant this was it. 

After countless sessions with the doctor, and feeling like a social outcast among my group of friends who started their periods in middle school, it had finally happened. 

The cramps in my gut that felt like my torso was being ripped apart, was in fact me entering womanhood. When my breath started to quicken, my mouth watering, I raised my hand, biting my lip against a cry. 

*Fuck.*

Something lurched in my gut, a wave of nausea crashing into me.

*I was going to throw up.*

“Mr Brighton.” 

Roman spoke up before me, waving his arm. “Can I use the bathroom?”

The teacher’s answer was always the same. Which was why I had been crossing my legs for the entirety of the class, unable to focus on anything but my gut trying to twist itself inside out. 

Mr Brighton leaned against the wall, his eyes glued to the PowerPoint awash in our faces. We had been staring at the exact same slide for maybe five minutes now, and our physics teacher was yet to speak, his gaze somewhere else.

Mr Brighton was my Dad’s age, a greying man in his early fifties who always wore the exact same suit with the exact same stain on his collar. 

The man was about as interesting as watching paint dry. 

Normally, I would drift off myself, lulled into slumber by the low drone of his voice. 

But the pain ripping me apart was keeping me awake. 

“Mr Brighton.” Roman said, louder. His voice snapped me out of it. “Can I use the bathroom?” He paused, exaggerating a loud sigh. *”Please?”*

The teacher straightened up, folding his arms. 

“Mr Hemlock, you know the rules. Why didn't you go before class?”

“I didn't *need* to go an hour ago, did I?”

“You will no longer need to go to the bathroom, Mr Hemlock.”

Roman made a snorting noise.

“What?”

The low murmur of my classmates collapsed into white noise.

Glancing at the clock, I was anticipating the school bell. 

The sickness swimming in the pit of my belly was reaching dangerous territory. 

**2:52pm.**

Something ice cold trickled down my spine. 

It was 2:52 the last time I checked, and five minutes had surely passed.

This time, I waited a whole minute and counted the seconds under my breath. The clock still didn't move. The ticker was frozen halfway between three and four. 

Slowly, the same realisation began to hit the twelve of us. The clock on the wall had stopped. But it wasn't the only thing that had stopped. The cool breeze drifting through the window was gone. 

The sound of birds outside, and the cheer squad practising their routine. 

Everything had stopped. Trying to ignore a sickly slither of panic twisting its way through me, I checked my phone under my desk. There was a text from my Mom lighting up my notifications. When I tried to swipe it open, nothing happened. My lock screen was frozen, stuck at 2:52pm.

With my hands growing clammy around my phone, I stared at the time, willing it to move, to flick to 2:53. 

But nothing happened, the numbers stubbornly staying at 2:52.

“What the fuck are you talking about?” Roman’s voice brought me back to reality, though I was sure I'd dropped my phone. I heard it hit the floor with a sickening crack. Whatever he was saying, though, faded into dull murmur, when I turned toward the window. 

Something was *wrong* outside.

The cheer squad were nowhere to be seen. 

Being on the top floor gave us a front row seat to their practice sessions.

I stopped watching when their flyer did a death defying flip, almost breaking her neck. *2:52pm.* I couldn't see the cheer squad. But I *did* see Jessie Carson mid-sprint across the track field, strawberry blonde curls suspended in a halo around her. 

I could see exactly where she had frozen in place, her left foot hovering off of the ground, her right foot driving momentum. It wasn't just Jessie who had stopped. The dirt she was kicking into a cloud behind her was hovering, caught in mid-air. 

Studying the faces around me, my mouth went dry. 

Roman Hemlock, mid-argument with our physics teacher. 

His eyes were wide, lips curved into what would have been a yell. 

Fuck. 

Was I the only one?

But then Roman blinked, and I realized the boy wasn't frozen. He was trying to think of a comeback. “What do you mean I won't need the bathroom anymore?”

“Mr Hemlock, please lower your voice.”

“Why? You can't dictate to me when I do and don't need the bathroom, dude!”

Moving onto the rest of my class, the others were still moving.

It was too quiet, though. 

Yes, Roman was still tapping his foot. 

Imogen was still chewing her gum. 

Kaz was still scribbling notes like a psychopath. 

But they were the *only* noise I could hear. 

I wasn't the only one confused. The classroom had pricked with a sense of urgency. Kids were checking their phones, their gazes glued to the clock. Even Roman, who was still arguing, was starting to notice. I watched his gaze lazily roll to the clock on the wall. 

I pretended not to see his cheeks visibly paling. 

We had all come to the exact same terrifying conclusion. 

**2:52pm.**

Time had come to a halt, and somehow, we had *not*.

“Is that clock broken?” Roman interrupted, leaning forward in his chair.

Kaz twisted around, settling the boy with an eye-roll. 

“Check your phone, dumbass.”

“I broke my phone.” 

Imogen threw her iPhone at him, narrowly missing hitting him in the face. 

“Everything is frozen,” She said, her voice shuddering. “It's not just the clock.”

I waited for Roman’s response. For once, though, he was speechless. 

“Well done, Imogen. That is correct.” Mr Brighton spoke up, tearing a piece of paper from a workbook and striding over to the door, glueing it over the glass window. When we started to protest, some of us were shouting, while others bursting into tears, he calmly took out his key and locked us in. 

I should have been surprised that our teacher had spontaneously decided to take his entire class hostage, but the rumor mill had been churning. 

According to Becca Jason, the guy’s wife divorced him and took his kids. 

I could feel myself sinking into my chair, phantom bugs filling my mouth. 

So, this guy had nothing to lose. 

Taking his place in front of his desk, the man settled us with a patient smile. 

“From now on, you will stay inside this room.” He said. “In case you haven't noticed, time is currently frozen at fifty two minutes past two. The thirteen of us are tucked into the twenty first second, and will be, for the foreseeable future.” 

I could tell the others wanted to argue, but we couldn't deny that time had stopped. Kaz was staring down at his frozen phone, Imogen hyperventilating behind me, Roman glaring at the clock, chewing on a pencil. We wanted it to be a prank, a joke, some kind of glitch in the matrix that would fix itself. 

But then a whole minute passed by. Followed by another. Kaz threw his phone on the floor, hissing in frustration. Imogen let out a wet sounding sob. 

Roman’s pencil split in his mouth, slipping from his fingers. 

We couldn't pretend it wasn't happening or call our teacher out on his BS, because it was everywhere around us. 

The sudden absence of outdoor ambience, birdsong, planes flying overhead, and traffic outside the school gates. Everyone and everything had stopped, and we were the only ones left. 

This was a nightmare, surely. 

My physics class were some of the most  boring and pretentious people in the school, and somehow the world had been reduced to the twelve of us inside our classroom. 

We were scared, of course we were. But reality had stopped making sense, crashing and burning in a single second. We had no choice but to listen to our teacher. “Now, before you freak out, it may not feel like it, but the twelve of you have  *also* stopped.” 

Mr Brighton held out his own hand, and placed it on his heart. 

He was right. 

I was so busy trying to understand what was happening, I had failed to realize my period cramps were gone. 

“Do me a favor, and press your hand over your heart.”

“You mean like, in a culty way?” Imogen whispered. 

“Obviously.” Roman grumbled, halfway out of his seat. He was hesitant, though, in case our teacher was armed. It only took one glance from our teacher, and he slumped back into his chair. “This crazy fucker clearly wants to play mind games with us.”

“No, I'm just asking you to feel for your heart.” 

I felt for mine, and there was nothing, my stomach twisting. 

Roman stabbed his fingers into his neck, feeling for a pulse. 

He tried his wrist. 

Then his heart. 

*Nothing*. 

“The twelve of you are currently in a state of stasis,” the teacher explained to us, “You are not alive, nor are you dead. Your bodily functions are also on pause, such as your heartbeat and your pulse. In this state there will be no need for food and water, or going to the bathroom.” 

His gaze found a ghastly looking Roman, who looked like he was going to faint. “Your minds, however, as you can see, are working as usual.”

“But *why*?” Imogen demanded in a shriek. 

Mr Brighton’s lip curled. “I would rather not answer that question.”

“Because you're lonely.” Roman spoke up. He swung back on his chair, narrowed eyes glued to the teacher. 

“Your wife and kids left you, so you're asserting power over a group of sixteen year olds. Which is kinda fucking pathetic.”

Mr Brighton’s expression darkened, and something slimy crept up my throat. 

The worst thing any of us could do was threaten him. He had taken kidnapping to a whole new level, and we were alone with this psychopath, trapped inside a second. I waited for the man to stride forward and attack the kid. But he didn't. 

Instead, the teacher leaned back on his desk. “Yes.” The man nodded. 

“I suppose you could say I am.”

“But why *us*?!” Kaz hissed. 

“Because you are *children*.” Mr Brighton responded casually. 

He straightened up, taking slow, intimidating steps towards Roman’s desk. The rest of us leaned back. I tried to pull my desk with me, but it was glued to the floor. Frozen. Mr Brighton’s shoes went click-clack across the hardwood floor. 

“You are right,” the man said in a murmur, “I *am* lonely. My wife and kids *did* leave me, and I have nobody left to control. I have  nobody else to contort and use to my advantage.” Reaching Roman’s desk, he leaned in close until he was nose to nose with the kid. 

“Congratulations, Mr Hemlock. You have just earned yourself detention.”

Roman stayed stubbornly still, but he was visibly afraid. I could see him very slowly backing away. Roman was all bark and no bite. He was a loud mouth, sure, but he was also the least confrontational person in the class. 

“What?” He spluttered. “You trap us in a *time loop* or time trap, or whatever, and you still want to act like a teacher?”

“Stand up.” The teacher ordered. 

“What if I don't?”

Mr Brighton’s expression didn't waver. “You said it yourself. I can and have trapped you inside a single second. What else do you think I'm capable of?”

Roman stood, kicking his chair out of the way.

“What are you planning on doing to me, old man?”

The teacher maintained his smile. “Stand up straight, and close your mouth.”

To my confusion, Roman Hemlock did all the above. 

He straightened up, and closed his mouth. 

“Do not fight me.” The teacher said calmly, “Do as you are told, and follow me.” 

The boy did exactly as instructed. 

His jaw slackened, that rebellious light in his eyes fizzling out. 

I think that's when we all collectively agreed that going against this teacher and trying to escape was bad. 

“I will use Mr Hemlock as an example to all of you,” Mr Brighton said, turning to the rest of us. “If you break the rules or are derogatory in any way, you will be given detention.” 

He grabbed the boy’s shoulders, forcing him to walk towards the supply closet. Roman moved like a robot, slightly off balance, his gaze glued to thin air, like he was tracking invisible butterflies.

""Your time in detention will depend on the severity of your rule-break.” He opened the door, gently pushing Roman inside, and following suit. When the door closed behind them, there was a pause, and I remembered how to breathe. 

Kaz Samuels slowly got up from his desk, inching towards the closet. 

“This guy is a certified nut.” He announced. 

He turned towards us. “Whatever he's doing to Hemlock, we’re probably next.”

“He stopped time.” I spoke up, my own voice barely a croak. “He’s capable of anything.”

“But *how* did he stop time?” Kaz whistled, tipping his head back. The boy was slow, his fingers grasping each desk as he slid down the aisle. “He said he was lonely, right? But why take it out on us? What did we do to him?”

“Check his desk for a weapon!” Imogen whisper-shrieked. 

Kaz nodded, striding over to the man's desk, his hands moving frantically, shoving paper on the floor. He took an uncertain seat on the man's chair. 

“There's nothing here,” he murmured, lifting stained coffee mugs and ancient textbooks. “It's just…test papers.” Kaz ducked from view, trying the drawers. 

“He's a fan of Pokémon,” he said, “There's a tonne of Pokémon cards,” Kaz straightened up, running a hand through his hair. “No sign of a weapon, though.”

He picked up a ruler, waving it around. “This could work. If we plunge it in his eye.”

“Try his laptop!” Imogen was halfway out of her seat. 

Kaz did, slamming the keys. “It's locked.”

“Look *harder*!” Ren Clarke threw a pencil at him.

“I am!”

After a minute of searching, Kaz grabbed a single piece of paper. 

He held it up, and I squinted. 

It was a list of our names, with several of them highlighted. 

“Fuck.” Kaz dropped the list, his expression crumpling. The stubborn bravado facade transforming him into our sort of leader dissipated, hollowing him out into exactly what he was. Just a scared kid. Kaz’s hands were shaking. 

“Mr Brighton’s got a hit list.” He whispered. “He's going to kill us.”

“How do you know that?” I found myself asking.

Kaz slowly dropped into a crouch, picking up the paper and holding it up. 

“Look.” He pointed to a capitalised name at the top of the list highlighted in red.

**ROMAN HEMLOCK.**

There were six names highlighted in red, including mine. 

**CRISTA ADAMS.**

As if on cue, Roman’s cry rang out from the supply closet, suddenly, freezing us all in place. Kaz jumped up, adapting the expression of a deer caught in headlights, eyes wide, almost unseeing. 

He fell over himself to tidy up the desk, putting everything back where he had found it, sliding the list between a pile of test papers. Kaz took slow, stumbled steps back, his feverish gaze glued to the closet, before turning and making a break for it and diving into his seat. 

“Brighton’s got a hit liiiist,” Kaz said, in a mocking sing-song, “And we’re *all* on it.”

What followed was deathly silence. I think we were expecting Roman to cry out again. But when he didn't, the class started to stir. Some kids started praying to a god they didn't believe in, while others were in varying states of denial, trying to call their parents with dead phones.

I wasn't sure what parts of me *had* stopped, but I was still alive, still felt like my lungs were deprived of oxygen, my chest aching. 

I'm not sure how long I sat there, trying to find my voice, a shriek trying and failing to rip through my mouth. 

Being kidnapped and held hostage is one thing, but being imprisoned inside a single, never ending second, was an existential hell worse than death. 

Slowly, I pressed my palm over my heart once again. Then I breathed into my cupped hands. 

I was expecting it, but no longer being able to feel my own heartbeat and breath, was fear I didn't think was possible. The kind that glued me to my seat, hollowing me out completely until I was nothing, an empty shell with no heartbeat, no breath, no thoughts, except denial, followed by acceptance. 

And finally, regret. 

I regretted not hugging my mother goodbye before I left for school. 

I regretted acting like a spoiled brat when my parents refused to drive me halfway across the country so I could attend Coachella. 

I regretted stepping inside Mr Brighton’s fourth period physics class. 

Mr Brighton reappeared, slamming the door behind him and locking the boy inside. Part of me flinched, while the rest of me remembered not to move a muscle. I was barely aware of time passing. Or it wasn't. Time had stopped, so now long had I been sitting there? 

I could no longer measure the passage of time with hunger or thirst, and my body felt the same. I wasn't stiff or tired or achy. Looking out of the window, the sky was the exact same crystal blue, every cloud in the exact same place. 

Jessie Carson was still frozen mid-run, strands of dark red hair caught around her. 

“What's wrong with you guys?” Mr Brighton chuckled, and I twisted back to the front, a shiver writhing down my spine. “Why don't you give me a smile?”

The teacher returned to his desk, and I was already subconsciously sitting up straight in my seat, forcing my lips into a jaw-breaking grin, following Brighton’s instructions. In the corner of my eye, Imogen was sitting very still, forcing an award-winning cheesy smile, while Kaz grinned through gritted teeth. 

“Mr Hemlock just earned himself two weeks inside the supply closet.” he said casually, perching himself on the edge of his desk. The man studied each of us, taking his time to rip every shred of us apart. 

*Mind, body, and soul.*

I struggled to maintain my stupid smile, shoving my shaking hands in my lap. 

“Would anyone like to *join* him, or are you going to follow the rules?”

The rest of us stayed silent. I don't think any of us breathed. 

Our teacher nodded to Kaz, inclining his head. 

“Samuels. Are you all right?”

Kaz’s smile faltered slightly. He shifted in his chair. I could see sweat trickling down his right temple. “Uh, yeah.” He swiped at his forehead, like he couldn't believe he was sweating. “Yeah, I'm good.”

The teacher’s eyes narrowed. He moved toward his desk, and we all held our breaths. Mr Brighton seemed to study his hit-list, lips curving into a frown. 

His gaze flicked to the boy, and then the paper. 

*He knew*, I thought dizzily. 

Mr Brighton *knew*  the kid had been rummaging through his desk. 

But this was all about control. The teacher was using fear to control us, to manipulate our thoughts without having to get physical. He could have called out the boy right then, but Brighton was settling with mental torture instead. 

He just wanted to make my classmate squirm. 

Without a word, the man folded up the piece of paper and slipped it into his pocket. “Mr Samuels, you are sweating,” our physics teacher said, mocking a frown. “Are you feeling okay?”

Kaz hesitated, tapping his shoe in a rhythm.  

Being one of the smartest kids in the room definitely gave him an advantage. 

I could already see the cogs turning behind half lidded eyes. Kaz was weighing each scenario, sorting them into positives and negatives. 

The positives of answering would mean he was one step towards being in the clear, but there were two negatives. 

Brighton would question him if he had left his seat, and then demand how his hit-list had magically moved across the desk. 

Talking back was surely a rule-break, as well as outright lying. 

Opening his mouth would get him in trouble, either way, and Kaz knew that. 

So, he just nodded, forcing an even bigger smile. 

Brighton’s lips pricked, his gaze straying on Kaz. “Good!” He cleared his throat, turning to the class. Kaz slumped in his seat with a sharp breath, resting his head in his arms. If Mr Brighton noticed, he didn't say anything. “Ignore the sweating. It should stop, along with hunger and thirst.”

Our teacher seemed to be able to manipulate everything in his vicinity. 

*Time.*

*Minds.*

And slowly… contorting *us* into his own. 

In the single second we were trapped inside, I felt days go by in a dizzying whirlwind that was like being permanently high. When I stood up, I felt like I was floating. 

When I sat down, hours could go by, even days, and I wouldn't even feel them. I did try and count the days, initially, scribbling them on a scrap piece of paper, but somewhere around the thirteenth or fourteenth day, I lost count. The world around us never changed, in permanent stasis, and maybe that was sending us a little crazy. 

After a while of being stuck at our desks, Mr Brighton allowed us to wander the classroom, as long as we stayed away from the door. I lay on the floor for days, counting ceiling tiles. 

Sometimes, Imogen would join me. 

I couldn't sleep, but I could pretend to sleep, imagining a world that was back to normal. I didn't feel hungry, but my brain did like to remind me of food at the weirdest times. I was aware of weeks passing us by, and then months. 

I never grew hungry or tired, and my bodily functions were none existent. 

I couldn't remember what pain felt like, or the urge to go to the bathroom. Even the concept of eating and drinking became foreign to me. Putting something in your mouth and chewing to sustain yourself? 

That sounded odd. 

The only thing that *was* changing was our slowly unravelling metal state.

I don't know how it started. Weekends and Tuesdays blended together. On one particular SaturTuesday, I was hanging upside down from my desk, watching Kaz and Imogen doodle on the whiteboard. 

Kaz had a plan to escape, but after a while, his ‘plan’ to distract the teacher, had gone nowhere. After passing notes between us, the twelve of us had decided that we needed a weapon. 

That was maybe a month ago. I wasn't sure what mind games our teacher was playing, but Kaz Samuels, who we were counting on to be our brains, was slowly falling under his spell. Their game had been going on for three days. The two of them were having a *competition* to see who could draw the craziest thing.

Mr Brighton was at his desk as usual, marking papers. 

Imogen was drawing a weird looking ‘skateboard’ when the doors to the storage closet flew open. 

Roman Hemlock appeared, and to my surprise, wasn't a hollow eyed shell. 

He held up his hand in a wave, his lips forming a small smile. 

“Yo.”

Roman’s reappearance was enough to snap us out of it. Kaz and Imogen stopped arguing, the rest of the class going silent. I sat up, blinking rapidly.

I was sure our collective consensus was that Roman Hemlock was dead. 

Mr Brighton lifted his head and gave the boy a civil nod. “Mr Hemlock will be rejoining us,” he said, his gaze going back to marking papers. “Please make him feel comfortable. I'm sure he's very excited to be able to talk to you again.”

Instead of going to his desk, the boy immediately joined the others, snatching the marker off of a baffled looking Kaz, and drawing an overly artistic sketch of a penis. I wasn't sure what confused me more. 

The fact that Roman Hemlock had some serious artistic skills, *or* that he seemed suspiciously fine for someone who had been locked in the storage closet for two weeks with no social interaction. 

With my last few lingering brain cells still clinging on, I studied the boy. 

There were no signs of bruises or scratches. 

His eyes seemed normal, not diluted or half lidded. 

Unable to stop myself, I jumped off of my desk and joined the others, where Kaz was already interrogating the guy. 

“WHAT–” 

Imogen nudged him, and he lowered his voice, leaning against the wall. “What did he do to you?”

Roman shrugged, rolling his eyes. “Relax, dude. He didn't do anything to me.”

“Then what was that yell?” Imogen hissed. 

The boy cocked his head. “Yell?”

“You yelled out,” Kaz folded his arms, narrowing his eyes. He was already suspecting one of us had been compromised– or worse, brainwashed into compliance. Kaz stepped closer, backing Roman into the desk. “You cried out when you first went in there,” he murmured, “So, what was *that*?”

Something in Roman’s eyes darkened. “Oh,” He said, his lip curling. “That.”

Kaz’s expression softened. He rested his hands on the boy’s shoulders. “Yeah,” He whispered. “What did he do to you?” 

Imogen shoved Kaz out of the way, shooting the boy a glare. 

“You don't *have* to tell us, you know.” She said in a  small voice. “If it's too traumatising, or he did something you don't want to talk about–”

Roman cut her off with a laugh, and suddenly, all eyes were on him.

The remaining nine of us were eagerly awaiting an explanation. 

“Are you fucking serious?” 

When Kaz didn't respond, Roman gathered us in a kind of hustle, the four of us grouped together. I felt like I was on the football field. Still, though, if the guy’s goal was to look as suspicious as possible, he was doing a great job. 

Roman studied each of us, one eyebrow cocked. When Mr Brighton glanced up from his work, Roman shot him a grin, lowering his voice to a hiss. 

“You seriously think our fifty year old physics teacher has been abusing me in the storage closet?

“Then why did you cry out?” Kaz demanded. “Did he hit you?”

Roman stuck out his bottom lip. “I'm pretty sure he didn't hit me.”

“So, you cried out for no reason.” 

“Why are you covering for him?” Imogen poked his forehead. “Are you lobotomised?”

Roman wafted her hand away. “Stop prodding me, and no, I'm 100% good.” He backed away from us, like we were observers, and he was the zoo attraction. 

“I won't be, if you keep treating me like I'm senile.”

“Okay, fine,” Kaz sighed. “Just answer one.”

“Shoot.”

“When you first went in there, you made an unmistakable sound of distress–”

“Not this again,” Roman groaned. “Of course I yelled! I was shoved into a pitch black storage closet on my own! What, did you expect me to stay silent?”

Kaz didn't look convinced, Imogen nervously sucking her teeth. 

The boy leaned back, resting his head against the wall. His eyes flickered shut. 

“Stop looking at me like that, there's nothing to tell you,” he murmured, “Brighton didn't do shit to me. I was just freaked out.” Prying one eye open, he fixed us with a glare. “I am *so* sorry for reacting like a human. Next time, I'll make sure to attack him and pin him to the ground.”

It's not like we believed him. I don't think Roman believed himself. 

Something significant had changed in him. He was no longer argumentative, like half of his personality had been torn away. Roman set a precedent. Because once he was following instructions and walking around with a dazed smile, others began to follow. I can't remember how much time had passed since I thought about escaping. 

Days and weeks and months had collapsed into fleeting seconds I only noticed when I wasn't playing games. 

I wasn't aware of my own lack of sanity until I found myself, on a random SaturWednesday. I was laughing, gathered with the others on the floor, around a Monopoly board. The game had been going on for almost a week. 

Reality hit me when I was laughing so hard I tipped back. 

I can't remember why I was laughing. I think Imogen told a bad joke. 

“Hand it over.” Roman, who was the King of Monopoly, held out his hand, demanding my last 250 bucks. I remember noticing his smile, my foggy brain trying to find hints that he was in some kind of trance, or being controlled by Brighton. But no. His smile was real. 

Genuine. 

To my shock and confusion, so was mine. 

I wasn't in a trance or any type of mind manipulation. I was completely conscious. 

*Was this… Stockholm syndrome?* I thought dizzily. 

*Was I enjoying this?*

My thoughts were like cotton candy, disconnected and wrong, and they barely felt like my own. My gaze found Imogen and Kaz, the two of them sitting shoulder to shoulder, enveloped in the game. 

They looked exactly the same, their hair, clothes, everything about them staying stagnant. It was them themselves who had drastically changed. I had never seen them look so carefree. 

Imogen was a hotheaded cheerleader, and Kaz was the smart kid who gave himself nosebleeds from overworking himself. But now, they were laughing, nudging each other, caught up in an inside joke. Blinking slowly, my gaze strayed on them. 

Sure, it could be manipulation. It could be brainwashing. But it could also be real.

Kaz caught my eye, raising a brow.

“You good, Christa?”

Again, my smile felt real. Like I was having fun. 

“Good. It's your turn.” 

I picked up the dice, throwing them across the board.

Two sixes. 

“I can already see her landing on one of my hotels.” Roman murmured. He sat up, resting his chin on his knees. “As the clear winner, I have a proposition.”

Ignoring him, I moved my piece– immediately landing on Park Place.

“I'll give you 500,” Roman announced, “If you give up New York avenue.”

“That's all I've got!” 

Imogen nudged me. “Don't do it. If you give him New York Avenue, he only needs one more.”

“One thousand.” Roman waved the notes in my face. 

“My final offer.” 

When I reached for the cash, he held it back. 

“New York Avenue"", he said, with a grin. 

“And your pride.”

Reluctantly, I handed my only property over. 

Kaz threw the dice and moved his piece, and I half remembered we had an escape plan. “Community chest.” Kaz picked up a card. “Go straight to jail.”*

Roman spluttered. “That's karma,” he said, “For stealing from the bank.”

“You were stealing too!”

We had a plan. 

We had…. a plan. 

After discussing it in detail, Imogen and I were going to try and get onto Brighton’s laptop. It wasn't a perfect way to escape, but it was coherent. 

So, what happened? 

We were going to get out, so what… what was *this*? 

Kaz’s earlier words hit me from months ago. 

*“Mr Brighton *is* the thing keeping us here,”* he explained. *“If we kill him, I'm like, 98% sure we’ll go back to normal.”*

*“Okay, and what if he dies and we’re *stuck*?”* Imogen whisper-shrieked. 

*“I said 98% for a reason. Yes, there's a small chance his power will die with him. But there's a bigger chance that its effects will die when he does.”*

Ren nodded slowly. *“Right, and where exactly did you learn this information?”*

*“You'll feel a lot better if I don't answer that.”*

*“Okay.”* Ren gritted his teeth.  *“So, we just need to find a weapon, right?”*

*“And don't tell Hemlock,”* Kaz rolled his eyes. *“I don't care what he says, that boy definitely had his mind fucked with. Hemlock is a liability. If we tell Roman, he tells Brighton, and we’re screwed.”* Kaz nodded to me, then the others. *“Keep your mouths shut.”*

Presently, I wasn't sure the boy *wanted* to escape. 

Slowly, I rolled my eyes over to Mr Brighton, who had joined us to play. 

He was happily marking papers, taking part when he could. 

It felt…right. 

Not like we had been forced or manipulated, but more like he belonged. Part of me wanted to question why I felt like this, but I found that I didn't care. I didn't *care* that we were essentially dead, in a never ending stasis and stuck inside fifty two minutes past two. 

I stopped thinking about the outside world a long time ago. 

I couldn't even remember my Mom’s face.

I made my decision, dazedly watching Imogen throw a *chance* card at Roman. 

He flung one back, threatening to tip the board. 

*I wanted to stay.*

In the corner of my eye, however, someone was still awake. 

Ren, who had been sitting next to me, kept moving, further and further away. 

I didn't notice until he was inching towards our teacher, a box cutter clenched between his fist. There must have been a point when we found a box cutter, when we made it our weapon of choice. 

But somewhere along the way, I think we just… lost the longing to want to escape. 

I didn't see the exact moment the boy stabbed the blade into the man's neck, plunging it through his flesh, but I did *feel* a sudden jolt, like time itself was starting to falter and tremble. 

Mr Brighton dropped to the ground, and I found my gaze flashing to the frozen clock.

Which was moving, suddenly. 

Slowly creeping towards **2:53pm.**

Something sticky ran underneath me, warm and wet. 

Blood. 

Blood that was *running*. 

Roman’s half lidded eyes found mine, and he blinked, dropping the dice. 

Like he'd been asleep for a long time. 

**2:53pm.**

*We were free*. 

The cool spring breeze grazing my cheeks was back. I could feel my own heartbeat, sticky sweat on my forehead. 

And outside, Jessie Carson let out a gut-churning scream. 

More screams rang out. 

Down the hallways. 

Getting closer. 

And *closer*. 

For a disorienting moment, I don't think any of us believed we were free. 

Roman twisted around, his gaze on the doorway. 

The piece of paper the teacher had stuck to the glass slipped away. 

But Roman’s gaze was glued to the door, his cheeks paling. 

His lips parted into a silent cry. 

Following his eyes, I glimpsed a shadow.  

A shadow that was frozen at *2:52pm.*

**2:53pm**. 

“Fuck.” Roman whispered, stumbling to his feet. 

He turned to the rest of us, his eyes wild. 

“Get DOWN!”

I dropped onto my knees, crawling under a desk, the classroom exploding around me. 

**2:54.**

Blood splattered the walls, and I was crawling in it, stained in my friends. 

**2:55.**

I grabbed Mr Brighton's hand, squeezing for dear life. 

Roman joined me, his trembling fingers feeling for a pulse. 

A gunshot rang in my ears, rattling my skull. 

When Roman went limp next to me, I wrapped my arms around my teacher. 

“Mr Brighton, say *Stop*.” I whispered, when Imogen’s screams *stopped*. 

*He was so cold…*

“Mr Brighton! Take us back!”

Footsteps coming towards me, ice cold steel protruding into my neck.
