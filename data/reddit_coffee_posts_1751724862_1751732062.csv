The house is quiet. There are no meetings. No messages. No one waiting. Just time. It stretches out in every direction. Unstructured. Unfamiliar.

You go to the kitchen. The coffee brews out of habit, not desire. The badge is gone. The inbox is gone. What‚Äôs left is a space you‚Äôre still learning to inhabit.

There are small rituals now. Slower meals. Longer glances out the window. A drawer full of things you once meant to fix.

Hey, MaximizeMe fam! üôå

So, here's a little confession: I've been guilty of taking some serious mental shortcuts in my life, and guess what? They didn‚Äôt always lead me down the right path. Maybe you can relate? 

Remember that infamous idea of ""fake it 'til you make it""? üòÖ It's a classic shortcut, right? At first glance, it seems super empowering! Just put on a confident face and *voil√†*, you‚Äôre living your best life! But let me tell you, relying too heavily on that had me feeling like I was juggling flaming swords while riding a unicycle. Yikes! 

Here are some common mental shortcuts I‚Äôve stumbled over (and maybe you have too):

- **Overgeneralizing**: ‚ÄúI always mess this up.‚Äù Like, really? You‚Äôre not a walking disaster! 
- **Jumping to conclusions**: That time I assumed my friend was mad at me because they didn't text back within 5 seconds. Turns out they were just busy. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- **Confirmation bias**: Only looking for info that backs up what I *want* to believe. Yeah, that's a recipe for disaster!

Has anyone else felt the sting of these shortcuts? It‚Äôs kind of wild how our brains look for the path of least resistance, but sometimes that path leads to a dead end, or worse, circling back to the beginning! 

Hey, we all want to save time and energy, right? But here‚Äôs the thing: sometimes, it‚Äôs worth taking a step back and re-evaluating which shortcuts we‚Äôre taking. 

My top tips for finding a better route:

1. **Mindful Awareness**: Slow down a bit! Next time you feel an assumption creeping in, pause. Take a deep breath, and reflect. 
   
2. **Seek Diverse Perspectives**: Chat with friends, or even that random person at the coffee shop. They might have insights that could flip the script for you! ‚òï

3. **Embrace Curiosity**: Instead of ‚ÄúI know,‚Äù try ‚ÄúI wonder.‚Äù It opens up a whole new world of possibilities!

Let's not forget: it‚Äôs totally okay to stumble. We're here to learn and grow together, so let's swap our favorite (and least favorite) mental shortcuts. What‚Äôs the shortcut you regret relying on? Or maybe one that‚Äôs actually worked out for you?

I see a lot of posts about the soles being low quality and don‚Äôt last, which may be the case for those individuals, but I just wanted to share my own subjective experience. It‚Äôs hard to determine how much of the sole wear comes from an abnormal gait, or excessive heel/foot drag.

Obviously the tread has worn smooth in the balls of my feet, but the material isn‚Äôt thin there yet and doesn‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs wearing through or anything.

The hustling, bustling calamity outside infiltrated the space with muffled assaults on her tranquility. Memories of questions and conclusions recite what she had asked and learned. In a desperate attempt to avoid becoming, she tuned into the noise, spots and locks onto a flock of birds spiralling toward the earth. Their wings danced in frantic chaos against the dull hues of a coming gray day.

The beauty and synergy of days past had then lost their luster, shattered by disillusionment to reveal the falling sky. Compartments collapsed. Content scattered. Her baseball of neatly contained life had split, revealing the wildly chaotic threads of truths that were only a few days before ordered by sound reasoning. Whispered promises and comforting lies were the threads of deception holding it all together.

The weight of truth crushed as a tidal wave of recognized lies drowned her in a sea of despair. Clara lost grip, her cup scattered on the floor like those fragranced dreams parading as reality. Her heart raced like a galloping herd of rabid hogs, mocking her careless loyalty to those easy illusions, gifted by caring people of rancid persuasion. One pretty picture after another shattered with relentless awareness.

In the dusk of shattered dreams and hard truths, Clara embraced reality until it wasn't so ugly as she had imagined. Epiphany embraced her, making love and soothing the pain of breached trust, of blatant misdirection, steered with shame and phony reward. She soon glowed, basking in the new comfort of truth.

I'm looking to move around the Ann Arbor area for work!  I'd be grateful for any insight from some locals.  I'm a 27 year old guy with a budget of roughly $1,700 a month, which I know already makes it difficult to find a place. 

  
Ideal checklist: 

1) Local coffee shops, stores, and parks nearby. I know with my budget I won't likely find something truly walkable, so a short drive is fine.

2) Community is younger leaning- Hoping to make new friends in the area. Good mix between slower pace vibes and a bar crawl.

3) Amenities: a) Allows cats, b) preferred washer and dryer in unit, c) AC, d) dishwasher

1lsd630,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1lsd630/uncover_if_the_bodum_34oz_chambord_french_press/,Uncover if the Bodum 34oz Chambord French Press delivers quality coffee review,"The Bodum 1928-16US4 French Press Coffee Maker, by design and reputation, certainly lives up to its legacy as one of the most sought-after brewing tools for coffee enthusiasts. As someone who thrives on freshly brewed coffee, this glass-and-stainless steel marvel became a core part of my morning ritual. Testing it daily gave me ample time to analyze its every feature and performance aspect, resulting in a fair mix of admiration and critical evaluation. Here‚Äôs how the French press fared during extensive use:

**Design and Build Quality**  
The aesthetics of this French press are undeniably captivating. The polished stainless steel finish combined with the high-heat borosilicate glass carafe gives it a timeless, classic appearance. The craftsmanship reflects a commitment to durability, which is unsurprising considering it still employs chrome-plating methods dating back to the fifties. The handle has a matte black finish, offering a firm and ergonomic grip. While brewing, I found the assembly sturdy, though the glass can feel a bit vulnerable if handled too roughly on busy mornings. It screams sophistication but might demand cautious handling in rushed households.  

**Ease of Use and Brewing Process**  
Operating this manual coffee maker is simple and intuitive. With no buttons or electrical components to worry about, it exclusively relies on your input. To make the perfect cup, I used fresh, coarsely ground beans and water just shy of boiling ‚Äì maintaining that ideal 92‚Äì96¬∞C range for extraction. The process might take a bit longer than automatic coffee makers, but it offers a satisfying sense of control. However, the brewing instructions must be followed precisely to avoid weak or overly bitter coffee, a point where some beginners might need practice.

**Coffee Quality and Outcomes**  
The coffee produced is nothing short of exceptional. Every cup showcases more flavor complexity compared to drip coffee machines, as the French press preserves a full-bodied profile. The mesh filter ensures that essential oils and small coffee particles pass through, adding depth to the brew. On occasion, a few more fine grounds found their way into the cup, which became a slight inconvenience. As someone who occasionally serves iced coffee during family gatherings, this product worked beautifully for cold brews too, making it highly versatile.

**Positives**  
A few highlights stood out during testing:  
- Elegant, polished design that complements any kitchen d√©cor.  
- Produces richer, full-flavored coffee preservation of essential oils.  
- Easy-maintenance parts‚Äîcleaning takes minimal effort when done promptly.  
- Environmentally friendly, with no disposable pods or filters required.  

**Critiques**  
Despite its excellent performance, the product has areas for improvement:  
- Glass carafe feels fragile, requiring careful handling in a busy kitchen environment.  
- May not suit users unfamiliar with manually controlled brewing techniques.  
- The mesh filter, while functional, can occasionally let fine coffee particles slip through.

**Competing Products**  
Stacking it against its competitors, the Bodum Chambord holds its own but isn‚Äôt without stiff competition. Compared to its counterpart, the Frieling Stainless Steel French Press, this model is lighter and easier to maneuver due to its glass construction but might lack the thermal retention offered by high-end, double-walled fully stainless steel presses. AquaBrew‚Äôs French press provides premium thermal insulation and modern aesthetics but sacrifices the minimalistic charm this one offers. While many alternatives come close, the Bodum excels in consistent brew quality and accessibility across user skill levels.

**Value for Money**  
This French press won me over on its value proposition. It delivers quality coffee without recurring costs, thanks to its reusable filter system. Even some pricier automatic coffee makers couldn‚Äôt replicate the richness and texture it provides. For coffee enthusiasts who seek simplicity without compromising on flavor, it justifies the investment. However, in terms of long-term durability, especially for users prone to mishaps, its glass carafe might indicate a trade-off.

The kit on the Sunderland players is definitely not the Avec one they switched to in 1994 as that had a massive red area on the shoulder, so the game is from the 91-92, 92-93 or 93-94 seasons.

I've been wanting to do one of these for awhile! I‚Äôm 33F, married, DINK with three cats. I work in marketing and I have lived in the Front Range (CO) for two years.¬†This is an average week in the life with a 3-day (holiday) weekend (6/28‚Äì7/4). Literally nothing particularly noteworthy happened this week, though boring doesn't mean it wasn't good.

# Assets and Debt

**Retirement Balance:** $121,000 (employer Roth 401(k), $3,500 (Roth IRA)

I‚Äôve been contributing to my employer 401(k) since I started working out of college, but only in the last several years have I started contributing 10‚Äì15%. I opened the Roth IRA this year and will ideally fully fund it, but it‚Äôs not top priority.

**Home Equity:** $150,000

We put 20% down on a $500,000 home almost two years ago. This is our second home, and a lot of the downpayment came from the sale of our first home, which we purchased for $150,000 and only put 5% down on.¬†

**Personal Savings Balance:** $33,000

**Checking Balance:** My goal is to keep both my personal account and my joint account with my spouse at four figures, but otherwise we don‚Äôt usually have more than $2‚Äì4k in checking.¬†

**Brokerage Account:** $4,500

**Joint Savings:** $18,500

My spouse A. and I maintain separate accounts and contribute a set amount to our joint checking each month. We use that to fund some joint savings accounts for specific purposes, like taxes, our cats‚Äô vet bills, and house projects.¬†We each pay for our own gym memberships and or services that only one of us use.

If we do something together, either we pay for it with our joint account, or sometimes one of us will cover it from our individual account. If one of us does something alone (seeing a movie, getting beers with friends, etc.) we pay for that from our individual accounts.

A. also has his own employer 401(k) and IRA accounts.

**Debt:** $0

I luckily have no debt other than our mortgage. I graduated in 2015 with about $32,000 of student loans but was able to pay them off during 2021. A. also has no debt, though he graduated with student loans, too.

# Income

**Income Progression:** I've been working in my field for 10+ years, and my starting salary was $32,000.¬†

I haven‚Äôt changed careers, but I‚Äôm working my 5th job. I got lucky when I joined a scaling company several years ago and was able to move up in both job duties and pay while there (started at $65,000 and was at $130,000 when I left).¬†

I‚Äôve been in my current job ($170,000) for less than two months, and that newness is reflected in my diary.¬†

**Main Job Monthly Take Home:** $7,800. Taxes are $3,900/month, 401(k) is $1,300/month, and health deductions are $92/month.¬†

**Side Gig Monthly Take Home:** I do some freelance work that usually ranges between $100‚Äì$500/month. I don‚Äôt actively seek it out so some months there‚Äôs nothing.¬†

**Spouse‚Äôs Income:** A. has a full-time job as well as regular contract work which totals approximately $150,000/year.¬†

# Expenses

**Mortgage:** Our payment (includes insurance, taxes, etc.) is $3,300/month, but we‚Äôve been paying $4,000 because we can currently afford to, and we‚Äôd like to pay off the house as soon as we can.¬†

**Savings contribution:** Usually anywhere from $500‚Äì$2,000 a month. Sometimes this goes to my individual savings account, and other times it goes into one of our joint accounts.¬†

**Investment contribution:** I don‚Äôt regularly invest outside of my 401(k), but sometimes if I‚Äôve had several months of funding my savings, I‚Äôll use that line in my budget for more investments.¬†

**Donations:** $15/monthly to an org. I also volunteer MANY hours for a separate org‚Äîit‚Äôs honestly too many to count since we have a couple week-long events as well as the work I do year-round.¬†

**Electric, gas, water:** Around $200/month

**Fiber:** $70/month

**Trash:** $19/month

**Cellphone:** Was $95/month, but I just upgraded my plan so it‚Äôs going to be more like $110 once all the one-time charges are off my bill.¬†

**Subscriptions:** Spotify account is a joint expense, $18.22.¬†

**Gym membership:** $129/month for my yoga studio membership.

**Park passes:** We pay $100 annually for a county park pass and $70 annually for a Rocky Mountain National Park pass.

**Pet expenses:** We put $150/month in a savings account for major expenses, and then spend around another $150 for food and litter.¬†

**Car insurance:** We own both of our vehicles outright, and we pay our insurance for the year up-front.¬†

# Saturday

**5:00 a.m**. - My alarm goes off. It‚Äôs going to be 90 degrees today and I need to get my run done before 9 or I‚Äôm cooked, literally. The trailhead is only 20 minutes away, but I need ample time to wake up (as do my bowels).¬†

**8:30 a.m.** \- I run a very steep 10k. I‚Äôm building back up after having surgery, and I‚Äôm getting close to my pre-op pace.¬†

**11:30 a.m.** \- After napping on the couch for two hours while re-watching one of my favorite TV shows for the fourth or fifth time, I use the excuse of having one of the cats (Eldest Boy) on me to persuade A. to go to the store to buy me chips (**$5** from our joint account) that I can have with my lunch.¬†

**2:30 p.m.** \- I start getting ready to leave the house. We have a friend‚Äôs gathering at a brewery, then we‚Äôre getting dinner.¬†

**3:50 p.m.** \- Before the gathering, we go to another brewery having an anniversary event. We each get two beers (**$19**, using our joint account) and then I also buy a shirt and glass (**$38**) because they‚Äôre running a special and I‚Äôve been wanting a shirt from this brewery for awhile.¬†

**4:30 p.m.** \- We arrive at Brewery #2. We end up staying longer than planned chatting with friends and have three beers each (**$44**, using our joint account), which for Olds such as ourselves is a lot.

**7:30 p.m.** \- We walk a mile to dinner. Again, because Old, we‚Äôre usually done eating before 6, so we‚Äôre starving. A. covers the meal at our favorite spot (they know us there, which is fun but also slightly unsettling since I don‚Äôt always like to be Perceived). We don‚Äôt order drinks since one of us will hopefully be good to drive after eating. Due to this, the meal is significantly cheaper than usual.¬†

**8:45 p.m.** \- On our walk back to the car, we stop in to a new ice cream place, where A. treats again. It‚Äôs fine, but the line is long and I prefer the other place nearby.¬†

**9:20 p.m.** \- We‚Äôre home! The cats are angry their dinner has been delayed by more than four hours past its usual time. We feed them and head straight to bed.¬†

**Daily Spend:** $106

# Sunday

**6:15 a.m.** \- My alarm goes off for yoga. I was stressed about sleeping badly due to the four beers I had, and it was a self-fulfilling prophecy. Luckily I‚Äôm not especially hungover, just slightly crusty.¬†

**7:00 a.m.** \- I take it easy during yoga and it feels pretty good. In a triumph of will, I manage to not let out any audible farts.

**8:30 a.m.** \- Home, breakfast, coffee, and TV time.¬†Eventually, I start a load of laundry and clean my bathroom. A. gets home with our weekly groceries (**$100** from our joint account) and I help put those away while he begins prepping some things for dinner. Since I‚Äôm up, I make an early lunch before resuming my place on the couch.¬†

**1:15 a.m.** \- Naptime. A Sunday nap isn‚Äôt out of character for me, but I‚Äôve been napping a ton the past week. I think it‚Äôs just extra fatigue from getting back into my workout routine post-surgery.¬†

**2:45 p.m.** \- I wake up in time to get a snack and water before hopping on a volunteer call.¬†

**4:35 p.m.** \- The call wraps earlier than expected and it‚Äôs time to fold some clothes.¬†

**5:30 p.m.** \- Dinner is ready. A. does all the cooking‚Äînot just tonight, always. After, he makes dessert while I do the dishes. We take a 10-minute walk around the block before I resume watching TV.¬†

**8:30 p.m.** \- Time for bed and my book. I‚Äôm starting a new one tonight, hopefully I can get into it.¬†

# Monday

**5:00 a.m.** \- Wakey wakey. Yoga‚Äôs at 5:30 and I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm only 10 minutes away from the studio. I don‚Äôt usually go back-to-back days, but I need to make sure I‚Äôm getting my money‚Äôs worth from the membership‚ÄîI have to go at least 8 times a month for it to be worth it. I wish I was disciplined enough to consistently practice at home, but I think all my exercise self-discipline gets used up by running.¬†

**7:15 a.m.** \- I get home and do my morning journaling, then I open my work laptop to see if there‚Äôs anything immediate that needs my attention. (There‚Äôs not.) I eat breakfast and crank out my morning tasks in time to go for a run at the flat trail near my house. So far it‚Äôs pretty quiet at work, and since there‚Äôs a Canadian and US holiday and it seems like lots of folks are taking off, I have reason to hope that will remain the case throughout the week.¬†

**9:55 a.m.** \- I run a 4-mile loop and am pleasantly surprised that I am faster than I was when I ran the same route pre-op. Very exciting! I have a shower realization that my last massage was in March, which spurs me to see if my regular therapist has an opening this week. She does! I go ahead and book since I had budgeted for a massage in July (**$81**).¬†

**11:00 a.m.** \- First meeting of the day is the weekly meeting with my team, then there‚Äôs some back and forth in Slack on a high-priority project, followed by a 1:1 with another coworker.

**12:40 p.m.** \- I make lunch and when I come back to eat at my desk, I see I now have a meeting scheduled for this afternoon, which displeases me. I‚Äôm then asked to weigh in on something I feel too new to have an opinion on. It doesn‚Äôt seem like an urgent matter, though now would be a good time for a fire drill since not much else is happening.¬†

**5:30 p.m.** \- The last-minute meeting is awkward, runs long, and is followed by lots of discussion concerning the high priority project and the wannabe-fire drill. I decide I‚Äôm done for the day. A. and I eat leftovers for dinner while watching TV.

**8:50 p.m.** \- Bedtime. The book I started last night is [*Care and Feeding*](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/d80ea524-b10a-4778-a6ea-94d57142c40a) and I‚Äôm into it. (Memoir is one of my favorite genres.)¬†

# Tuesday

**6:45 a.m.** \- Sleeping in today! I indulge in some ‚Äúscroll in bed‚Äù time before getting ready for the day. I do some journaling and sun salutations. My shoulders are a little sore from the back-to-back yoga days.

**8:00 a.m.** \- I open up my work laptop and catch up on things while I eat breakfast. It‚Äôs pretty quiet so far, so I use the time to invoice a freelance client and check in briefly with another.¬†

**8:45 a.m.** \- I jinxed myself. Millions of fires, everywhere! They die down just in time for some meetings. After I make it through those, I make myself some lunch and I eat at my desk while reviewing some of my team‚Äôs work before moving into focus time.

**1:45 p.m.** \- I feel a little off, and I‚Äôve gotten through my main solo project for the afternoon, so I decide to take a 20-minute nap before my meetings. I wake up in time for a quick snack.¬†

**3:50 p.m.** \- Meetings wrap. One part of the high priority project is a shitshow right now, due largely in part to too many stakeholders, most of whom are only occasionally responsive.¬†

**5:00 p.m.** \- I shut my computer. Oof, it‚Äôs been a day. It‚Äôs currently a little stormy out (weather imitating mood, perhaps), but I think it‚Äôs mostly passed. Hopefully this will make it feel little cooler during run club. I start getting ready‚Äîthe brewery we meet at is close to my house, so I usually run over there to warm up.¬†

**5:40 p.m.** \- I leave for run club. We do one of our regular routes that‚Äôs just under 4 miles. My pace is decent given the conditions‚Äîdespite a few people saying it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot as hot as I expected,‚Äù it‚Äôs about as hot as *I* expected, which is too fucking hot. My discounted beer (**$6**) goes down FAST tonight. I hang out for an hour before heading home.¬†

**8:05 p.m.** \-¬† I warm up leftovers and eat at the kitchen island reading since I feel too gross to go sit on the couch and watch TV. When I finish, A comes up and enlists my help with Kitty Spa Day (AKA cutting the cats‚Äô nails). By 9, I‚Äôm showered, in bed, and ready to keep reading.¬†

**Daily Spend:** $6

# Wednesday

**6:30 a.m.** \- I wake up 15 minutes before my alarm and decide I might as well start the day. I get ready, journal, do my PT exercises, and go on a 20-minute walk before properly logging on. I get sucked into multiple Slack convos right away and quickly make breakfast before time gets away from me.¬†

**9:30 a.m.** \- Meetings begin. I have a meeting with some of my team to discuss a project, a 1:1 with another report, and a 1:1 with a coworker to discuss some processes.¬†

**11:20 a.m.** \- Still lots to do, but I step away to make some lunch since I have less than an hour before meetings resume. I eat at my desk and keep Slackin‚Äô away, though I also book a follow-up tattoo appointment for later in the month (**$20** deposit).

**12:30 p.m.** \- I have a quick meeting re: the high priority project fire to make a decision I don‚Äôt feel qualified to make, but my boss is backing it so hopefully it doesn‚Äôt blow up in my face. Next is a call that I get to join as an off-camera, silent attendee‚Äîfeeling #blessed for this.¬†

**2:20 p.m.** \- Two of the three cats (Eldest Boy and Middle Child) have their annual vet appointments today. A. and I stuff them into their carriers (they do *not* go gently into that good night). At the vet, Eldest Boy models a fawn response by sweetly accepting pets and Churus, whereas Middle Child goes into freeze mode. (Tiny Baby, whose annual appointment is in the fall, has a fight response and often has to be put in a kitty straightjacket.) Both cats get a clean bill of health, for which we pay **$317** (we pay from our joint account, but will use our pet fund savings to ultimately cover it). A. takes the cats home and I head to my massage.¬†

**3:40 p.m** \- I arrive at the massage studio with just enough time to check on and respond to some messages, then I have a blissful, completely Slack-free hour. My therapist does this thing where she digs her elbow into various parts of my butt while bending my leg back, and it‚Äôs actually amazing. As usual, I make sure to tip (**$20**).

**5:00 p.m.** \- On the way home, I hit the library, where I return one book ([*Pizza Girl*](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/e73541e1-5bd6-4b4d-b8bb-3c2ca3d94183), which I enjoyed a lot) and pick up a hold ([*Sunrise on the Reaping*](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/deb3321c-61a2-480d-a7b9-f24d01cebad5), which I assume will be highly entertaining if not high-brow). I go to the local grocery store to pick up hippie self-care products (moisturizer, **$26**, two lip balms, **$8**) and sorbetto (**$6**).¬†

**5:30 p.m.** \- I get home and A has dinner ready. I polish off the sorbetto for dessert and watch TV.

**7:45 p.m.** \- Bed and reading time. I‚Äôm 200 pages into *Care and Feeding* and still enjoying it.

**Daily Spend:** $397

# Thursday

**5:00 a.m.** \- My alarm goes off for yoga, but I‚Äôve had a terrible night‚Äôs sleep. Currently all three cats are on me, and Eldest Boy has been whining all night due to the presence of his sisters (he usually sleeps on A., so I don‚Äôt know why he doesn‚Äôt simply move over). I decide to sleep in.¬†

**6:45 a.m.** \- Eldest Boy is still in bed, but it‚Äôs time for me to get up. I journal, do a very quick yoga routine, and get ready for the day. I make a game-time decision to wash the sheets‚Äîit‚Äôs a little earlier than I normally would, but the amount of fur on the duvet has become untenable.¬†

**8:10 a.m.** \- I open my laptop and feel some hope that it will be a quiet day. I get through my morning meetings‚Äîa 1:1 with my manager and a team meeting‚Äîboth of which are pleasant. After the meetings wrap, my desire to kick off the long weekend in a clean home spurs me to do some frenzied vacuuming, sweeping, and dusting. A. comes home with some supplemental groceries (always necessary, **$10** from our joint account).¬†

**11:45 a.m.** \- I make lunch and, as usual, eat at my desk. I check my bank account and remember that payday is here a day early due to the holiday. Yay!¬†

**12:30 p.m.** \- Meetings start. I have two back-to-back presentations to other teams, both of which go well.

**2:55 p.m.** \- With my boss's blessing, I shut my laptop and plan to monitor solely on my phone for the rest of the day. I make the bed and entertain the idea of a nap, but end up finishing *Care and Feeding* instead. (4 out of 5 stars from me.)¬†

**5:25 p.m.** \- I leave to pick up my friend M. for run club at a different brewery. There are just a few of us, and we run slowly in a pack and call it after 3 miles since it‚Äôs ungodly hot (90 degrees‚Äîlet‚Äôs hear it for Type 2 fun!). We all get our discounted beers (**$7**) and hang out on the brewery patio.

**8:00 p.m.** \- I head home, shower, eat, and watch an episode of TV. By 9:30, A. is already in bed, and I‚Äôm ready to join him after last night‚Äôs terrible sleep and raw-dogging the whole day sans nap.¬†

**Daily Spend:** $17

# Friday

**6:00 a.m.** \- Our alarms go off. We take our time, but we‚Äôre still out of the house by 6:45 to begin our 50-minute drive to a new-to-us trail. The hike ends up being a little over 5 miles, and it‚Äôs very pretty. While we walk, we discuss the merits of taking an international trip this fall (A.‚Äôs idea, since it has been several years since we took an international vacation) versus investing more in the house (my preference, since we have various domestic travel commitments already lined up for fall). We come down on the side of the house as it‚Äôll be cheaper overall, but agree to plan some sort of international trip for 2026.¬†

**10:20 a.m.** \- We get back into town and grab a quick brunch (**$36** from the joint account).¬†

**11:30 a.m.** \- Home and showered, I begin some laundry while watching TV.

**1:30 p.m.** \- I wheedle A. into making me lunch, and after I pour myself a beer. Two loads of laundry down, another two to go. I play fetch with Tiny Baby, who seems to realize today is not a work day and therefore expects a lot of attention.¬†

**5:50 p.m.** \-¬†We put dinner together, some classic 4th of July food (basically our only acknowledgement of holiday).

**8:00 p.m.** \-¬†I'm in bed reading and hoping the firework action is minimal‚Äîalarm is set for 4:45 a.m. to get in a longer run before the heat tomorrow. The cycle repeats!

# TL;DR

Spent my money mostly on beer, groceries, and my cats. Worked and worked out, but balanced that with a decent amount of couch rotting.

# Reflection

Overall, I've become pretty frugal over the last several years, I think for the following reasons:

1. Adopting an anti-consumption philosophy: In my early 20s I did a lot of ""retail therapy"" but since then I've started to consider how much shit is produced and barely used and the impact of it all is staggering. (Plug for r/Anticonsumption.)
2. Evolving interests: One of my main hobbies is running, which is pretty low cost. I like to tell people my other main hobby is ""enjoying my mortgage,"" AKA sitting at home.
3. Desire to FIRE: I'm increasingly ambivalent about my work and would like to FIRE or soft-FIRE (or whatever the term is) by the time I'm 40. I haven't run the numbers on how doable that specific goal is, but ultimately A. and I both want to pay off the house very early for all the financial freedom it will create for us.

Still, I'm definitely willing to spend on non-essential things for enjoyment, and I think my week reflects all of this.

Elara Langton had just finished her global journey and arrived back in Egeorto at 2 AM. Instead of heading to her apartment, she caught a taxi straight to the swankiest hotel in downtown Landblic.

She hadn't slept a wink the night before and was completely drained. When she got to the hotel, exhaustion hit her like a ton of bricks. She swiped her key card and let herself into room 2201 on the top floor.

Too tired to even glance around the suite, she tossed her suitcase into the entryway, unzipped it right there on the floor, and pulled out a black silk nightgown. Then she made a beeline for the bathroom.

The presidential suite had a bathtub right by the window, perfect for soaking while taking in the dazzling night views of Landblic. The one-way glass added a thrilling sense of privacy.

Suddenly, her curiosity was sparked‚Äîthere was a small cabinet next to the tub. Most people wouldn't know what was inside, but Elara knew exactly what to expect‚Äîshe'd seen these setups in plenty of local hotels.

She slipped out of her white dress, opened the cabinet with a flick of her fingers, and her eyes narrowed as she picked out something tempting, tore open the packaging, and stepped into the tub.

\*\*\*\*\*

Three in the morning, and Adrian was deep in sleep‚Äîuntil something tugged him back to the surface. It was a woman's voice, soft and low, like a whisper in the dark. At first, it was just a gentle hum, barely there, but with an undeniable pull.

He was half-asleep, but the sound wrapped around him, dragging him in. He let himself drift, caught in a hazy half-dream, until the hum grew more insistent and urgent...

His heart started racing, and he jolted awake, every nerve on edge. The moment he opened his eyes, the sound hit a high note and then vanished into silence.

Adrian blinked, trying to focus. The hotel room was dark, the only light coming from the dim yellow glow of the bathroom. Everything looked the same as when he'd drifted off. He started to doubt it was just a dream.

He shook his head, feeling a strange mix of confusion and frustration. He'd always been the type to keep a tight rein on his desires. This kind of dream was new territory.

It had to be the stress, the nonstop work for the past month, his mind and body stretched to the breaking point.

He decided a cold shower might help clear his head. Throwing off the covers, he got out of bed, naked.

The bathroom door was wide open. He stepped inside, his long legs carrying him forward. A white dress on the floor caught his eye, and he frowned, puzzled. He moved closer, and then his gaze landed on the bathtub.

There, a naked woman was lounging inside, her eyes half-closed, her face flushed, and her lips parted as she breathed softly. She looked like a dream, but in the most intoxicating way.

Adrian's face remained impassive, but his heart skipped a beat. He stood there for a moment, making sure this wasn't just another strange dream. Then he spoke, his voice calm but firm, ""Who are you?""

Elara was still in a daze, her mind foggy from the afterglow of her little escape. She was halfway to sleep when Adrian's voice startled her. She jerked upright, her eyes wide with surprise as she saw him standing there, his expression unreadable.

He was naked, having just come from bed, and this sent a jolt through Elara. She instinctively covered herself, turning away. She shouted, her voice soft but tinged with panic, ""Hey! You creep! Get out.""

Her voice was just the same as the one in his ""dream""‚ÄîAdrian's eyes narrowed slightly. ""You saw me first,"" he said, his voice low and gravelly. ""And now you're telling me to leave? This is my room.""

Elara rolled her eyes, her voice dripping with sarcasm. ""How shameless!""

""Me, shameless?"" Adrian raised an eyebrow. ""Who's the one in the bathtub, acting all self-righteous while doing something so indecent?""

# Chapter 2 Sexual Harassment

Elara huddled in the tub, feeling like she was about to burst. She was just doing what any woman would do, so she was furious that Adrian was making a fuss over it. She snapped, her voice trembling with anger, ""Get out!""

But Adrian didn't budge. He stood there, unimpressed. ""This is my place. Why should I leave?""

Naked and exposed, Elara felt her anger bubble over. The humiliation of being caught, the frustration of being overruled, and the fact that he was still there‚Äîher chest tightened. She took a deep breath, trying to keep her cool.

After what felt like forever, he still hadn't moved. Elara closed her eyes, took a steadying breath, and softened her tone. ""Sir, have you seen enough? Could you please step out so I can get dressed? And maybe put some clothes on yourself?""

Adrian snapped out of a daze and didn't want any argument with her now. He turned and walked out of the bathroom without another word.

As soon as she heard the door click shut, Elara leaped out of the tub. She grabbed the black silk nightgown, pulled it on, and then tiptoed out.

Right then, Adrian was now sitting on the couch, wrapped in a hotel robe, a cigarette between his fingers.

Before they could even think about another showdown, the doorbell rang.

Adrian stood up, his tall frame looming over her. As he walked past, she felt a strange sense of intimidation wash over her.

Elara crossed her arms, her eyes still flashing with anger. ""Pervert! Where are you going?"" she snapped.

Without turning around, Adrian replied coldly, ""Who's the pervert here is still up for debate. Since we can't seem to sort this out, let the hotel handle it.""

He opened the door to reveal a woman in a grey pantsuit, her makeup flawless and her smile professional. She was the hotel's VIP manager. ""Mr. Hartley, you mentioned someone broke into your room?"" she asked.

Adrian's expression was grim as he stepped aside to let her in. He pointed to Elara, who was standing by the couch. ""That's her. She broke into my room at night and sexually harassed me.""

Elara froze. 'What? Broke into his room? Sexually harassed him? Me?'

Already seething, she exploded. ""Do you have some narcissistic problem? Think you're Brad Pitt or something? Why would I even want to harass you?""

""Isn't it obvious?"" Adrian retorted. ""Who was naked in my bathtub, enjoying‚Äî""

Elara cut him off sharply, her voice rising in panic. ""Shut up!""

Adrian didn't continue, but he didn't want to let her go. He said, his tone biting, ""So this isn't harassment?""

Elara knew she was no match for this silver-tongued man. Her face burning with frustration, she marched to the entryway, grabbed her key card and ID from her suitcase, and thrust them at the manager.

She said, ""Here's my key card and ID. I used it to get in here, just like anyone else.""

Her face was now flushed with anger, her delicate features twisted into a scowl that somehow made her look more exasperated than intimidating.

She pointed a slender finger at Adrian and snapped, ""The real creep here is him! He sneaked into my room in the middle of the night to spy on me while I was bathing. I'm calling the police.""

The manager glanced at the right key card and frowned. Hearing Elara's threat to call the police, she started to panic. That was the last thing the hotel needed.

""Ms. Langton,"" she said quickly, ""there must be some misunderstanding. Maybe the hotel system glitched and gave you the wrong room, or the front desk handed you the wrong key card.

""It's late now. Let me arrange a new room for you. I'll give you a full explanation in the morning, okay?""

Elara was exhausted, but Adrian's harsh words still rankled her. She retorted, ""Why don't you check him first? Did he check in under his own name? Does he even have a key for this room?""

""Ms. Langton,"" the manager explained, ""Mr. Hartley is a close friend of our boss. This room is reserved for him permanently and isn't available for rent. Technically, he can't be considered an intruder.""

# Chapter 3 Beware

Elara was stunned into silence. It seemed she was really supposed to just take this. She glanced at Adrian, whose lips curled into a self-satisfied smirk, as if he was daring her to come up with a comeback.

But she just couldn't bring herself to back down. ""So you're saying I just have to swallow this and call it a night? Even though I was seen naked for no reason, and now he's accusing me of harassment?""

The manager looked apologetic. ""I'm really sorry. Please stay in another room tonight. We'll sort this out first thing tomorrow morning‚Äî""

Elara didn't want to hear more. She grabbed her phone from her bag and started dialing 911.

The manager's eyes widened in panic, and she glanced nervously at Adrian.

Before Elara could finish, Adrian grabbed her wrist and yanked the phone away. ""Miss, looking at someone naked isn't a crime. Calling the police won't change that. Besides, I was in the room first. If anyone's at fault here, it's you for barging in.""

His expression was cold and menacing, his eyes hard and unyielding. He had that air of someone used to being in control.

He didn't want to cause trouble for his friend's hotel, and as their regular lawyer, he knew a police report would only make things worse for him.

Adrian took another step closer, his cold gaze meeting her frightened one. His words were a clear threat. ""If you call the police, I'll sue you for trespassing and harassment.""

He tightened his grip on Elara's slender wrist, holding her so tightly that her skin turned red.

Elara winced, her eyes filling with tears. ""How dare you‚Äî"" Her voice was barely above a whisper, trembling with rage, and even the manager felt a flicker of sympathy.

Adrian's relentless approach also made the manager start to worry. She quickly stepped in. ""Mr. Hartley, let's calm down. Let me talk to her first and see if we can sort this out.""

Adrian released Elara's wrist, but his stern expression remained unchanged.

Elara frowned, her eyes glistening with tears as she rubbed her reddened wrist. Her usually confident voice wavered. ""Give me my phone back.""

Adrian tensed, thinking she might call the police. His grip on the phone tightened.

Elara lunged for her phone, her face streaked with tears. ""You'll regret this."" She tossed over her shoulder, her voice shaking. She spun around, grabbed a camel coat from her suitcase in the hallway, threw it on, and yanked her high heels back on. Then she stormed out.

Adrian raised an eyebrow. 'She's scared off just like that? I haven't even gotten a chance to question her yet, and she's already acting like the victim?'

\*\*\*\*\*

Elara gritted her teeth, dragging her suitcase out of the hotel. She pulled out her phone and made a call. ""Ruby, what kind of dump did you recommend? This place is trash!""

Her friend Ruby sounded surprised. ""Wait, what? It's the top-rated hotel in town.""

""Is it the kind where you end up getting arrested?""

Ruby, back home and sipping her coffee, frowned in confusion. ""What are you talking about?""

""I'm posting about this on my social media. This hotel is a disaster.""

""Hey, don't! I'm trying to get in good with the owner. Don't mess this up for me.""

""You're so blinded by this guy. You have no idea how much I've been through today.""

Ruby didn't know what happened exactly and sighed, trying to smooth things over, ""Can't you just let it go? You haven't seen how hot this guy is. I finally got him to agree to dinner this weekend by having you promote his hotel.""

""No way. I can't take this. I'm exposing him. And I'm getting my influencer friends to share it.""

Ruby laughed, ""Elara, calm down. Was it bad service? Or was the place dirty? Once I've got this guy wrapped around my finger, I'll get back at him for you.

""Oh, and he's got this super-hot friend. I'll introduce you. This top lawyer guy‚Äîwell, if I weren't into Victor, I'd never let him go.""

""Thanks, but I'll pass. You can keep those two for yourself.""

""Elara, seriously, are you just going to stick with Alex forever?""

""Hey, you're right. Alex is the hottest guy ever.""

After hanging up, Elara quickly drafted a tweet, then set up her phone tripod at the hotel entrance and started filming a video. Her fingers tapped away on the screen and soon, the tweet was posted.

\[Beware! Dolphin Bay Hotel owned by Montgomery Group ($3,000/night) is a scam. A creep broke in, and the manager silenced me, no cops allowed. The creep, a lawyer, blamed me for trespassing‚Äîall threats, no solutions! Avoid it, girls. It's pricey and ruins trips.\]

# Chapter 4 Is It A Big Deal?

In Room 2201 of Dolphin Bay Hotel, Adrian sat on the couch, still wearing his hotel robe and smoking a cigarette.

He had just wrapped up a major case here. Last night, he'd hung out with some friends, drank until he was tipsy, and stumbled back to the hotel around midnight. Too tired to do anything else, he'd taken a quick shower and crashed into bed.

At 4 a.m., his grogginess vanished after the incident. He grabbed his phone from the bedside table, padded back to the couch, and poured himself a drink. His phone had died somehow, and he turned it on and started scrolling through his unread messages.

Victor: \[Crash in my room tonight. 2209, y' know. I got to hook up with this top influencer for a hotel staycation promo. She's a big deal‚Äîhard to get. Last-minute arrangement, no spare rooms, and my place is cluttered‚Äîso she's staying in yours.\]

After reading the message, Adrian frowned and quickly typed back: \[I pissed her off. Is it a big deal?\]

Victor was back home, playing golf with friends. When he saw the text, he was stunned. \[Huh?\]

Adrian: \[Saw your text too late. She was in the tub‚ÄîI walked in.\]

You can call me the guy who laughs at his own jokes, says ‚Äúpivot!‚Äù during actual moves, and secretly believes every group chat needs a Chandler.  
Born in Gaza, raised on memes, and fueled by coffee stronger than Ross‚Äôs divorce anxiety.

Some things about me:  
‚Ä¢ I drop FRIENDS references in real life (and still get shocked when people *don‚Äôt* get them).  
‚Ä¢ I‚Äôm the friend who brings the weird snacks to the party.  
‚Ä¢ Life goal: Find my own Central Perk squad and maybe, just maybe, a pet monkey named Marcel.  
‚Ä¢ Sarcasm is my cardio, and ‚ÄúSmelly Cat‚Äù is basically my personal anthem.  
‚Ä¢ My weirdness comes in limited edition.

What to expect if you stick around:

* Hot takes on sitcoms, cold takes on pineapple pizza
* Random acts of meme-ness
* Existential crises, but, you know, with laugh tracks
* Occasional deep/funny thoughts about life, the universe, and everything in between
* Friendly replies, always (unless you say ‚ÄúWe were on a break‚Äù‚Äîthen it‚Äôs war)

Drop your favorite FRIENDS quote or meme below, or just tell me who your spirit character is.  
Let‚Äôs see if we can make this the Central Perk of Reddit profiles.

Could I *be* any happier to be here?

I‚Äôm 34 living in upstate NY and looking for someone who is also seeking a deep connection that goes past the terrible prompts on the dating apps. I have a stable job, a house that I share with my 13 year old rescue pup and live w mostly quiet life due to my introverted nature. I work remotely but prefer to stay here for some time due to being by family, but distance is not an issue if the connection is there.
I believe if you‚Äôve found your person, distance should not get in the way of that.

In my spare time I love to be out and about, wandering and walking aimlessly. I love going to parks/trails and occasionally thrifting or shopping but am trying to be more minimalistic. I also love trying hole in the wall food/drink/coffee spots. If I‚Äôm at home, I‚Äôm usually tackling a home project or DIY, cleaning, or binging a show/anime.

I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3 with brown hair/eyes and roughly 140 lbs, currently working to get down to 125. I believe that physical attraction is very important so if you‚Äôre down to chat and a connection is there I‚Äôm happy to send a photo. I do feel that an emotional connection is more important but I understand that that cannot exist without the physical aspect.

I do have a thing for taller guys so I have to say unfortunately based on my preferences I would prefer someone who‚Äôs 5‚Äô10 or taller.

Age wise I am looking for someone who is 30-40 but am willing to go a year or 2 below/above. Generally speaking just searching for someone in this range.

I also do not partake in any recreational drug use, it‚Äôs just not my thing and something I wouldn‚Äôt really be a fan of my partner doing either. I do drink socially but don‚Äôt keep anything at home in terms of alcohol.

Lastly I am also CF (child free) meaning I don‚Äôt ever foresee myself wanting/having children, but am a huge animal lover in all aspects, be it dogs, cats, lizards, etc, you name it.

1lscu8s,https://www.reddit.com/r/dysautonomia/comments/1lscu8s/nicotine_helped_me/,Nicotine helped me?,"Hi everyone, 
I am 26F and was diagnosed with orthostatic hypotension a few years ago. Also suspected MCAS from my allergist and Ehlers Danlos. I manage the MCAS with antihistimes, and I've had doctors suspect ED but I've yet to get a diagnosis. 

I ran myself ragged for about 10 days with little rest on vacation. I mean I slept 4-6 hours a night. Flew home, worked the next day and crashed at 6pm that day (Thursday). The next day, yesterday, I couldn't get out of bed without severe symptoms. I drank 3 gatorlytes, ate extra salt, did all the things I usually do to recover because I had a concert that evening. I went to the concert and got very ill and almost passed out a few time. I was completely hydrated and had lots of salt in me but nothing was working. 

Out of pure desperation, I grabbed one of my fiance's 4mg nicotine pouches. I had no idea what else to do. Even sitting I felt like I was going to pass out. Within 5 minutes I perked right up and with the help of a couple more through the night I stood up and felt about 85% better through the night. 

This was wild to me. Has this happened to anyone else? I'm on adderall 10mg for my ADHD so I tend to avoid any other stimulants. Even coffee before my adderall would make me tachycardic. And I have to watch my adderall amd stay very hydrated or ill get tachycardia. I'm just confused as to why the nicotine helped me so much. I don't want to use those pouches every day. Maybe I could try the patches? 

Does anyone have experience with nicotine helping them? ",1,1751730304.0,dysautonomia,1,1.0,False

1lscrbb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lscrbb,Pairing Chronicles #190: Large cigar and small coffee,"As much as I love pairing cigars with coffee, a decent coffee shouldn't take more than 10 minutes to finish, while a cigar can last so much, especially if it's a Partagas Lusitania like the one I smoked yesterday. When smoking it I remembered something a so-called habanos expert once told me when I asked him why he always used the word creamy to describe flavors. I had always thought it was related to the cream flavor, as in vanilla and a sort of milky component, but he told me that in cigars this meant when the smoke texture is kind of oily and the flavors stick to the palate for a long time. That sort of creaminess came to mind often when smoking the Lusitanias. 

Even this coffee being a macchiato, the pairing was great thanks to the flavors of vanilla, pepper, oak, nuts and chocolate in the Lusi, while the coffee had all the creamy texture that kept those flavors on the palate as long as possible, and the milky flavors I assumed originally. 

I realized that coffee can pair with one of the thirds and not necessarily the whole thing. I paired this macchiato with the first third of the cigar and then went into some sparkling water and the result was amazing. Here's another experimenting I'm going to go into, with each third of the cigar. ",4,1751730087.0,cigar_refuge,1,1.0,False
1lscr61,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1lscr61/rush_too_far_by_abbi_glines/,Rush Too Far by Abbi Glines:,"CHAPTER ONE  
  
¬† This isn‚Äôt your typical love story. It‚Äôs really too completely fucked up to be charming. But when you‚Äôre the bastard son of the legendary drummer from one of the most beloved rock bands in the world, you expect serious fuck-ups. It‚Äôs what we‚Äôre known for. Add the selfish, spoiled, self-centered mother who raised me into the mix, and the outcome isn‚Äôt pretty.  
  
¬† There are so many places where I could start this story. In my bedroom, as I held my sister while she cried from the pain of our mother‚Äôs cruel words. At the front door, as she watched, with tears streaming down her face, while my father came to take me away for the weekend, leaving her alone. Both of those things happened often, marking me forever. I hated to see her cry. Yet it was a part of my life.  
  
¬† We shared the same mother, but our fathers were different. Mine was a famous rocker, who brought me into his world of sex, drugs, and rock and roll every other weekend and for a month during the summers. He never forgot me. He never made excuses. He was always there. As imperfect as he was, Dean Finlay always showed up to get me. Even if he wasn‚Äôt sober, he came.  
  
¬† Nan‚Äôs father never came. She was alone when I was gone, and even though I loved being with my dad, I hated knowing she needed me. I was her parent. I was the one person she could trust to take care of her. It made me grow up quickly.  
  
¬† When I asked my dad to bring her along, too, he would get this sad look on his face and shake his head. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt, son. Wish I could, but your momma won‚Äôt allow that.‚Äù  
  
¬† He never said anything more. I just knew that if my mother wouldn‚Äôt allow it, then there was no hope. So Nan was left alone. I wanted to hate someone for that, but hating my mother was hard. She was my mom. I was a kid.  
  
¬† So I found a place to focus my hate and resentment at the injustice of Nan‚Äôs life. The man who didn‚Äôt come to see her. The man whose blood ran through her veins yet didn‚Äôt love her enough even to send a birthday card. He had his own family now. Nan had been to see them once.  
  
¬† She had forced Mom to take her to his house. She wanted to talk to him. See his face. She just knew he would love her. I think, deep down, she thought Mom hadn‚Äôt told him about her. She had this fairy tale in her head that her father would realize she existed and swoop in and save her. Give her the love she so desperately sought.  
  
¬† His house had been smaller than ours. Much smaller. It was seven hours away in a small country town in Alabama. Nan had said it was perfect. Mom had called it pathetic. It hadn‚Äôt been the house, though, that haunted Nan. Not the small white picket fence that she described to me in detail. Or the basketball hoop outside and the bicycles leaning against the garage door.  
  
¬† It had been the girl who opened the door. She‚Äôd had long blond hair, almost white. She had reminded Nan of a princess. Except that she‚Äôd been wearing tennis shoes with dirt on them. Nan had never owned a pair of tennis shoes or been near dirt. The girl had smiled at her, and Nan had been momentarily enchanted. Then she‚Äôd seen the pictures on the wall behind the girl. Pictures of this girl and another girl just like this one. And a man holding both their hands. He was smiling and laughing.  
  
¬† He was their father.  
  
¬† This was one of the two daughters he loved. It had been obvious, even to Nan‚Äôs young eyes, that he was happy in those photos. He wasn‚Äôt missing the child he had left behind. The one her mother kept telling her he knew about.  
  
¬† All those things our mother had tried to tell her over the years that she had refused to believe suddenly fell into place. She had been telling the truth. Nan‚Äôs father hadn‚Äôt wanted her, because he had this life. These two beautiful, angelic daughters and a wife who looked so much like them.  
  
¬† Those photos on the wall had tortured Nan for years afterward. Again, I wanted to hate my mother for taking her there. For shoving the truth in her face. At least when Nan had lived in her fairy tale, she had been happier, but her innocence was lost that day. And my hate for her father and his family began to grow inside me.  
  
¬† They had taken from my little sister the life she deserved, a father who could love her. Those girls didn‚Äôt deserve him more than Nan did. That woman he was married to used her beauty and those girls to keep him from Nan. I hated them all.  
  
¬† I eventually acted on that hate, but the story really starts the night Blaire Wynn walked into my house with a nervous frown and the fucking face of an angel. My worst nightmare . . .  
  
¬† I had told Nan I didn‚Äôt want people over that night, but she‚Äôd invited them anyway. My little sister didn‚Äôt take no for an answer ever. Leaning back on the couch, I stretched my legs out in front of me and took a drink of my beer. I needed to hang around here long enough to make sure things weren‚Äôt going to get out of hand. Nan‚Äôs friends were younger than mine. They got a little rowdy sometimes. But I put up with it because it made her happy.  
  
¬† Mom running off to fucking Paris with her new husband, Nan‚Äôs still-inattentive father, hadn‚Äôt helped Nan‚Äôs mood lately. This was all I could think of to cheer her up. For once in her life, I wished my mother would think of someone other than herself.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúRush, meet Blaire. I believe she might belong to you. I found her outside looking a little lost.‚Äù Grant‚Äôs voice broke into my thoughts. I looked up at my stepbrother and then at the girl standing beside him. I‚Äôd seen that face before. It was older, but I recognized it.  
  
¬† Shit.  
  
¬† She was one of them. I hadn‚Äôt known their names, but I‚Äôd remembered there were two of them. This one was . . . Blaire. I cut my eyes toward Nan to see her standing not too far away with a scowl on her face. This wasn‚Äôt going to be good. Did  
Grant not realize who this girl was?  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIs that so?‚Äù I asked, racking my brain for some way to get her out of here‚Äîand fast. Nan was going to blow any minute. I studied the girl who had been a source of pain for my sister most of her life. She was gorgeous. Her heart-shaped face was highlighted by a pair of big blue eyes with the longest natural eyelashes I‚Äôd ever seen. Silky platinum-blond curls brushed against a pair of really nice tits that she was showing off in a tight tank top. Damn. Yeah, she needed to go. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs cute, but she‚Äôs young. Can‚Äôt say she‚Äôs mine.‚Äù  
  
¬† The girl flinched. If I hadn‚Äôt been watching her so closely, I would have missed it. The lost expression on her face didn‚Äôt add up. She‚Äôd walked into this house knowing she was in unwelcome territory. Why did she look so innocent?  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOh, she‚Äôs yours, all right. Seeing as her daddy has run off to Paris with your momma for the next few weeks, I‚Äôd say this one now belongs to you. I‚Äôd gladly offer her a room at my place if you want. That is, if she promises to leave her deadly weapon in the truck.‚Äù Grant was finding this amusing. The dick. He knew who she was, all right. He loved the fact that this was upsetting Nan. Grant would do anything to piss Nan off.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt make her mine,‚Äù I replied. She needed to take the hint and leave.  
  
¬† Grant cleared his throat. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre kidding, right?‚Äù  
  
¬† I took a swig of my beer, then leveled my gaze at Grant. I wasn‚Äôt in the mood for his and Nan‚Äôs drama. This was taking it too far. Even for him. The girl had to go.  
  
¬† She appeared to be ready to run. This wasn‚Äôt what she‚Äôd been expecting. Had she really thought her dear ol‚Äô dad would be here, waiting for her? That story sounded like bullshit. She‚Äôd lived with the man for fourteen years. I had known him for three years, and I knew he was a piece of shit.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI got a house full of guests tonight, and my bed‚Äôs already full,‚Äù I informed her, then looked back at my brother. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs best if we let her go find a hotel until I can get in touch with her daddy.‚Äù  
  
¬† Blaire reached for the suitcase that Grant was holding. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs right. I should go. This was a very bad idea,‚Äù she said with a hitch in her voice. Grant didn‚Äôt let the suitcase go easily. She tugged hard to get it out of his grasp. I could see the unshed tears in her eyes, and it tugged at my conscience. Was there something I was missing here? Did she really expect us to open our arms wide for her?  
  
¬† Blaire hurried to the exit. I watched the gleeful look stretch over Nan‚Äôs face as Blaire walked past her.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLeaving so soon?‚Äù Nan asked her. Blaire didn‚Äôt respond.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou ‚Äôre a heartless fuck. You know that?‚Äù Grant snarled beside me.  
  
¬† I wasn‚Äôt in the mood to deal with him. Nan strutted over to us with a triumphant grin. She‚Äôd enjoyed that. I understood why. Blaire was a reminder of all that Nan had missed out on while growing up.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShe looks exactly like I remember her. Pale and plain,‚Äù Nan purred, sinking down beside me on the couch.  
  
¬† Grant snorted. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre as blind as you are mean. You may hate her, but she‚Äôs mouthwatering.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt start,‚Äù I warned Grant. Nan might appear happy, but I knew that if she dwelled on it too much, she‚Äôd break down.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt go after her, I will. And I‚Äôm gonna put her sexy ass up at my place. She isn‚Äôt what you two assume she is. I talked to her. She hasn‚Äôt got a clue. That dumb-ass father of yours told her to come here. No one is that good of a liar,‚Äù Grant said as he glared at Nan.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDad would never have told her to come to Rush‚Äôs. She came here because she‚Äôs a mooch. She smelled money. Did you see what she was wearing?‚Äù Nan scrunched up her nose in disgust.  
  
¬† Grant chuckled. ‚ÄúHell, yeah, I saw what she was wearing. Why do you think I want to get her back to my place so bad? She‚Äôs smoking hot, Nan. I don‚Äôt give a shit what you say. The girl is innocent, lost, and smoking damn hot.‚Äù  
  
¬† Grant turned and headed for the door. He was going after her. I couldn‚Äôt let him do that. He was easily fooled. I agreed that the girl was easy on the eyes, but he was thinking with his dick.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúStop. I‚Äôll go after her,‚Äù I said, standing up.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Nan asked in a horrified voice.  
  
¬† Grant stepped back and let me pass him. I didn‚Äôt turn back and acknowledge my sister. Grant was right. I needed to see if this was an act or if she really had been told by her douchebag father to come here. Not to mention that I wanted to get a look at her without an audience.  
  
¬† CHAPTER TWO  
  
¬† She was walking up to an old, beat-up truck when I opened the door and stepped outside. I paused a moment, wondering if it was hers or if someone had brought her here. Grant hadn‚Äôt mentioned anyone else. I squinted against the dark to see if I could make out someone inside the truck, but I couldn‚Äôt tell from this far away.  
  
¬† Blaire jerked open the driver‚Äôs-side door and then paused to take a deep breath. It was almost dramatic, or at least it would have been had she known she was being watched. But from the way her shoulders sagged in defeat before she climbed up into the truck, I knew she had no idea that she had an audience.  
  
¬† But then again, maybe she did. I knew nothing about this girl. I only knew that her father was a fucking mooch. He took what my mother and Nan gave him, yet he never returned their tokens of affection or love. The man was cold. I had seen it in his eyes. He cared nothing for Nan or my stupid mother. He was using them both.  
  
¬† The girl was beautiful. There was no question about that. But she had also been raised by that man. She could be a master manipulator. Using her beauty to get what she wanted and not caring whom she hurt along the way.  
  
¬† I walked down the steps and toward the truck. She was still sitting there, and I wanted her gone before Grant came out and fell for this act of hers. He‚Äôd take her home with him. And she‚Äôd use him until she was bored. I wasn‚Äôt just protecting my sister; I was protecting my brother from her, too. Grant was an easy target.  
  
¬† She turned, and her eyes collided with mine before she let out a scream. Her red-rimmed eyes sure looked like she‚Äôd been crying real tears. No one was out here to see her, so there was the slight possibility that this wasn‚Äôt part of an elaborate scam.  
  
¬† I waited for her to do something other than stare at me like I was the stranger when she was on my property. As if she‚Äôd read my mind, she swung her gaze back to her steering wheel and made a move to crank the truck.  
  
¬† Nothing.  
  
¬† She started to become frantic in her attempts to get the truck to crank, but from the click I‚Äôd heard, I guessed there wasn‚Äôt a drop of gas in her tank. Maybe she was desperate. I still didn‚Äôt trust her.  
  
¬† The sight of her hitting her steering wheel in frustration was funny. What good was that gonna do if the idiot had run her tank completely empty?  
  
¬† She finally opened the door to the truck and looked up at me. If she wasn‚Äôt as damn innocent as she looked, then the girl was a hell of an actress.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúProblems?‚Äù I asked.  
  
¬† The look on her face said she didn‚Äôt want to tell me that she couldn‚Äôt leave. I reminded myself again that this was Abe Wynn‚Äôs daughter. The one he had raised. The one he had abandoned Nan for all those years. I would not feel sorry for her.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm out of gas,‚Äù she said with a soft voice.  
  
¬† No shit. If I let her go back inside, I was going to have to deal with Nan. If I didn‚Äôt, Grant would take care of her. And then she would more than likely take advantage of him.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHow old are you?‚Äù I asked. I should have known this already, but damn, I thought she was older than she looked. The big-eyed, scared look on her face made her seem so young. The way she filled out that tank top and jeans was the only sign that she was at least legal.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNineteen,‚Äù she replied.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúReally?‚Äù I asked, not sure I believed her.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes. Really.‚Äù The annoyed frown was cute. Dammit. I didn‚Äôt want to think she was cute. She was a fucking complication I didn‚Äôt need.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSorry. You just look younger,‚Äù I said with a smirk. Then I let my gaze tra  
vel down her body. I didn‚Äôt need her thinking I was someone she could trust. I wasn‚Äôt. I never would be. ‚ÄúI take that back. Your body looks every bit of nineteen. It‚Äôs that face of yours that looks so fresh and young. You don‚Äôt wear makeup?‚Äù  
  
¬† She didn‚Äôt get offended, but her frown grew. Not my desired effect. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm out of gas. I have twenty dollars to my name. My father has run off and left me after telling me he‚Äôd help me get back on my feet. Trust me, he was the last person I wanted to ask for help. No, I don‚Äôt wear makeup. I have bigger problems than looking pretty. Now, are you going to call the police or a tow truck? If I get a choice, I prefer the police.‚Äù  
  
¬† Had she really just suggested I call the police? And was that disdain for her dear ol‚Äô dad that I heard in her voice? I was pretty damn sure it was. Maybe he hadn‚Äôt been the model father that Nan had imagined in her head from the one short visit she‚Äôd made to that house when she was a kid. Sounded like Abe was on her shit list.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like your father, and judging from the tone in your voice, neither do you,‚Äù I said, letting the idea that maybe she was another casualty of Abe Wynn sink in. He‚Äôd abandoned Nan, and it sure as hell sounded like he had abandoned this daughter, too. I was about to do something I would regret. ‚ÄúThere is one room that is empty tonight. It will be until my mom gets home. I don‚Äôt keep her maid around when she isn‚Äôt here‚ÄîHenrietta only stops by to clean once a week while Mom is on vacation. You can have her bedroom under the stairs. It‚Äôs small, but it‚Äôs got a bed.‚Äù  
  
¬† The look of disbelief and relief on her face almost made the idea of facing Nan worth it. Even though I was pretty damn sure Blaire and Nan had father-abandonment issues in common, I knew Nan would never accept that. She was determined to hate someone, and Blaire was going to take the brunt of her anger.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMy only other option is this truck. I can assure you that what you‚Äôre offering is much better. Thank you,‚Äù she said tightly.  
  
¬† Fuck. Had I really been about to leave this girl in a truck? That was dangerous. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs your suitcase?‚Äù I asked, wanting to get this over with and talk to Nan.  
  
¬† Blaire closed the truck door and walked back to get her suitcase. There was no way her little body was picking that up and lifting it over the bed of the truck. I reached behind her and grabbed it.  
  
¬† She spun around, and the astonished look on her face made me grin. I winked at her. ‚ÄúI can carry your bag. I‚Äôm not that big of an ass.

Thank you a-again,‚Äù she said with a stutter, as those big, innocent-looking eyes locked with mine.  
  
¬† Damn, her eyelashes were long. I didn‚Äôt see girls without their makeup often. Blaire‚Äôs natural beauty was startling. I would have to remind myself that she was nothing but trouble. That and keep my fucking distance. Maybe I should have let her get her own bag. At least if she thought I was an asshole, she‚Äôd stay away.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAh, good, you stopped her. I was giving you five minutes and then coming out here to make sure you hadn‚Äôt completely run her off,‚Äù Grant said, snapping me out of whatever trance this girl had put me under. Motherfucker, I had to stop this shit now.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs gonna take Henrietta‚Äôs room until I can get in touch with her father and figure something out,‚Äù I replied, and shoved the luggage at Grant. ‚ÄúHere, you take her to her room. I have company to get back to.‚Äù  
  
¬† I didn‚Äôt glance back at her, nor did I make eye contact with Grant. I needed distance. And I needed to talk to Nan. She wasn‚Äôt going to be happy, but there was no way in hell I was letting that girl sleep in her truck. She would draw attention. She was gorgeous and completely unable to take care of herself. Dammit! Why had I gone and pulled Abe Wynn into our life? He was causing all this shit.  
  
¬† Nan was standing at the door with her arms crossed over her chest, glaring at me. I wanted her pissed. As long as she was mad at me, she wouldn‚Äôt cry. I didn‚Äôt deal well when she cried. I‚Äôd been the one trying to ease her pain since she was little. When Nan cried, I immediately started trying to fix things.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhy is she still here?‚Äù Nan snapped, looking over my shoulder before I could shut the door and block out the fact that Grant was headed this way with Blaire.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe need to talk.‚Äù I grabbed her arm and pulled her away from the door and toward the stairs. ‚ÄúUpstairs. If you‚Äôre gonna yell, I don‚Äôt want to cause a scene,‚Äù I told her, making sure to use my stern voice.  
  
¬† She frowned and stomped up the stairs like a five-year-old.  
  
¬† I followed her up, hoping she would get far enough away from the front door before it opened. I didn‚Äôt take a deep breath until she was stalking into the bedroom she had used back when this was our summer home. Before I became an adult and took what was mine.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre buying her shit, aren‚Äôt you? Grant talked you into it! I knew I should have followed him out there. He is such a dickhead. He‚Äôs only doing this to get to me,‚Äù she spat out before I could say anything.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs staying in the room under the fucking stairs. It isn‚Äôt like I‚Äôm putting her up here. And she‚Äôs only staying until I can get a hold of Abe and figure out what to do. She has no gas in her truck and no money to get a hotel room. You want to be mad at somebody, fine, be mad at motherfucking Abe!‚Äù I hadn‚Äôt meant to raise my voice, but the more I thought about Abe running off to Paris knowing that his daughter was headed here in a beat-up old truck with no money, the more it pissed me off. Anything could have happened to her. She was too damn breakable and needy.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou think she‚Äôs hot. I saw the look in your eyes. I‚Äôm not stupid. That‚Äôs all this is,‚Äù Nan said, before sticking out her lip in a pout. ‚ÄúSeeing her hurts me, Rush. You know that. She had him for sixteen years. It‚Äôs my turn!‚Äù  
  
¬† I shook my head in disbelief. She thought she had Abe now? Really? He was off living it up in Paris on my mother‚Äôs dime, and Nan thought that meant she had won? ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a fucking loser, Nan. She had his ass for sixteen years. I don‚Äôt think that means she won something. He let her come here thinking he would help her and didn‚Äôt think twice about the fact that she‚Äôs a little helpless girl with these big-ass sad eyes that any man could take advantage of.‚Äù I stopped talking, because I was saying too much.  
  
¬† Nan‚Äôs eyes went wide. ‚ÄúHoly hell! Don‚Äôt you fuck her! You hear me? Do not fuck her! She leaves as soon as you can kick her out. I do not want her here.‚Äù  
  
¬† Talking to my sister was like talking to a wall. She was so stubborn. I wasn‚Äôt doing this anymore. She could make all the demands she wanted, but I owned this house. I owned her condo. I owned everything in her life. I was in control. Not her.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGo back down to your party and your friends. I‚Äôm going to bed. Let me handle this the way it needs to be handled,‚Äù I said, then turned and headed for the door.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBut you‚Äôre gonna fuck her, aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù Nan asked from behind me.  
  
¬† I wanted her to stop saying that word in relation to Blaire, because, damn it all to hell, it was making me think about all that white-blond hair on my pillow and those eyes looking up at me as she climaxed. I didn‚Äôt answer Nan. I wasn‚Äôt going to fuck Blaire Wynn. I was going to keep as far away from her as possible. But Nan wasn‚Äôt going to order me around, either. I made my own choices.  
  
¬† CHAPTER THREE  
  
¬† The music was loudly pumping downstairs, but I knew I wouldn‚Äôt be able to hear it up in my room.  
  
¬† I wasn‚Äôt in the mood for all that shit down there. I hadn‚Äôt been in the mood before Blaire Wynn showed up, and I sure wasn‚Äôt in the mood now.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThere you are,‚Äù a female cooed, and I turned to see one of Nan‚Äôs friends from the club walking toward me. Her skirt was so short her ass almost hung out of the back. That had been the only reason I noticed her. Hard to miss an ass right there on display. I couldn‚Äôt remember her name, though.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou lost?‚Äù I asked, not liking that she‚Äôd come upstairs. My rule was to keep the party away from my personal space.  
  
¬† She pushed her chest out and bit down on her bottom lip before batting her eyelashes at me. Long fake eyelashes. Nothing like Blaire‚Äôs. Fuck me. Why was I thinking about Blaire?  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm exactly where I want to be. With you,‚Äù she said in a husky whisper, before pressing her tits to my chest and running her hand down to cup my dick. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard how good you can make a girl feel. How you can make her scream from orgasms, over and over again,‚Äù she said, gently squeezing me. ‚ÄúMake me come, Rush.‚Äù  
  
¬† I reached down and grabbed a strand of her blond hair. It wasn‚Äôt as blond as . . . no. Goddammit, I was doing it again. Comparing everything about her to Blaire. This was an issue I needed to get control of‚Äînow. ‚ÄúBeg,‚Äù I told her.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúPlease, Rush,‚Äù she quickly replied, and she rubbed my uninterested cock to life. ‚ÄúI want you to fuck me, please.‚Äù  
  
¬† She was good. Sounded almost like a porn star. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just sex, babe. Nothing more. And it‚Äôs just tonight,‚Äù I told her. I always made sure they knew the rules. We wouldn‚Äôt have a repeat unless she was damn good.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHmm, I‚Äôll remind you that you said that,‚Äù she said, winking up at me like she didn‚Äôt believe me at all. Either she was fucking brilliant in the sack, or it was wishful thinking on her part. I hardly ever went back for seconds. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs your room?‚Äù she asked, pressing a kiss to my chest.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNot taking you to my room,‚Äù I told her, and shoved her back until she stumbled into the guest bedroom I used for sex. Girls didn‚Äôt get to go to my room. That was my place, and I didn‚Äôt want memories of females up there.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOh, Mr. Impatient,‚Äù she said, giggling as she shimmied out of her skirt and licked her lips. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a pro at sucking cock.‚Äù  
  
¬† I pulled my shirt off and went over to sit on the bed. ‚ÄúShow me,‚Äù I replied.  
  
¬† The smell of perfume hit my nose, and I squinted against the sun, cursing whoever hadn‚Äôt closed the damn curtains last night. I rolled over, and the naked body beside me made a noise. She‚Äôd stayed all night. Shit. I hated the ones who didn‚Äôt leave. They were the clingy ones. The ones who thought this was more than a fuck. Did she really think getting on her knees and sucking me off without telling me her name was going to win her points?  
  
¬† I stood up and found my jeans, then jerked them on. The girl yawned, and I decided I‚Äôd forgo the shirt and get the hell out while I had time. She‚Äôd get the hint when I was nowhere to be found. I opened the door slowly, slipped out into the hallway, and headed for the stairs. If I went to my room, she‚Äôd come knocking on my door. I could take off down the beach and get in a morning run. But first, I needed coff  
ee.  
  
¬† I fixed a cup quickly, then headed toward the French doors leading outside. The moment I reached the door, I spotted her. That long, silky hair of hers was blowing in the breeze as she stood on my porch looking out at the water. I loved that view. It was peaceful. I wondered what she was thinking. Did she worry that Abe might not come back? Was she really going to find a way to leave? Or was she the mooch her father was?  
  
¬† After a night of sex with a nameless friend of my sister‚Äôs, I wondered what it would be like to get close to Blaire. She wouldn‚Äôt throw herself at me, and she sure as hell wouldn‚Äôt get on her knees and suck me off because I told her to. Why the fuck did the idea of innocence appeal to me? That was complicated. I didn‚Äôt do complicated. I couldn‚Äôt ignore her, though. Not this morning. I needed to see her face again and see if that sincere look was still there. Was she angry about sleeping under the stairs? Would the claws come out now?  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat view never gets old,‚Äù I said, causing her to spin around and gape at me.  
  
¬† I had startled her. I started to laugh when her gaze traveled down my bare chest and focused on my abs. What the hell? She was checking me out. Maybe she wasn‚Äôt that innocent. The idea made my stomach sour.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAre you enjoying the view?‚Äù I asked, masking my disappointment with amusement. She blinked rapidly as if waking from a trance and lifted her gaze back to my face. I hated the idea of her throwing herself at me. I didn‚Äôt want her to be like the others. Why the fuck it mattered, I didn‚Äôt know, but it did. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let me interrupt you. I was enjoying it myself,‚Äù I told her, unable to keep the annoyance out of my voice. I took a sip of my coffee. Her face turned bright red, and she spun around to face the water again. Why did the simple fact that she‚Äôd been caught looking and gotten embarrassed make me so fucking happy? Damn. I couldn‚Äôt keep from laughing with relief.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThere you are. I missed you in bed this morning.‚Äù I recognized the voice from last night. Shit. I‚Äôd wasted time, and she‚Äôd found me. Blaire turned back to look at me, and then her eyes went to the girl pressing up against me. This was good. She needed to see what a sorry-ass piece of shit I could be. This was what I wanted. She‚Äôd stay away from me if she saw this. But the flash of interest in Blaire‚Äôs eyes as the girl ran her fingernails down my chest did things to me I didn‚Äôt want to admit.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time for you to go,‚Äù I said, moving her hand off of me and pointing in the general direction of the front door.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù she asked with surprise in her voice, as if I hadn‚Äôt told her last night that this wasn‚Äôt happening again.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou got what you came here for, babe. You wanted me between your legs. You got it. Now I‚Äôm done,‚Äù I reminded her.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre kidding me!‚Äù she replied with an angry snarl. Maybe she hadn‚Äôt believed me last night. Her mistake.  
  
¬† I shook my head at my own stupidity and took another drink of my coffee. One day, I would learn that these hookups with a sleepover were trouble.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou are not going to do this to me. Last night was amazing. You know it,‚Äù she said in a whiny voice as she reached for my arm, which I pulled out of her grasp. It wasn‚Äôt ‚ÄúBeg Rush‚Äù time anymore. We did that last night. It was fun. She got off more times than she could count. But for me, it was mediocre.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI warned you last night, when you came to me begging and taking off your clothes, that all it would only ever be was one night of sex. Nothing more,‚Äù I said, annoyed that I even had to remind her.  
  
¬† I didn‚Äôt look back at her. I kept my eyes on the water and drank my coffee as if she‚Äôd already left. With a dramatic stomp of her feet, she left.  
  
¬† The horrified look on Blaire‚Äôs face made me quickly get over the interruption of last night‚Äôs mistake. ‚ÄúSo how did you sleep last night?‚Äù I asked. It had to be cramped in that room, plus the stairs and the noise in the house probably sucked. This was her chance to complain. Show her true colors.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDo you do that often?‚Äù she asked with an annoyed look on her face. That was adorable . . . dammit.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat? Ask people if they slept well?‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt going to let that face get to me. She was leaving as soon as I talked to Abe. This was his problem, not mine. The fact that I enjoyed looking at her was even more of a reason to get her the hell out of here.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHave sex with girls and then throw them out like trash,‚Äù she replied. Those big eyes of hers went wide, as if she were shocked at the words that had come out of her own mouth.  
  
¬† I wanted to laugh. She made it hard to stay focused. I set my cup down and stretched out on the lounge chair beside me. The best course of action was to get Blaire to hate me. I‚Äôd be doing us both a favor. If she hated me, I could easily keep my distance. ‚ÄúDo you always stick your nose where it doesn‚Äôt belong?‚Äù I asked.  
  
¬† Instead of the anger I expected to flash in her eyes, I saw remorse. Really? I had been an ass. She wasn‚Äôt supposed to look as if she were sorry for calling me out on my shit.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNot normally, no. I‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù she said with an apologetic half-smile, and she hurried inside.  
  
¬† What the fuck? Had she just really apologized to me? Where did this girl come from? Women didn‚Äôt act like her. Had no one taught her not to back down from bullies?  
  
¬† I stood up and turned to look inside and found her picking up empty bottles and garbage littered all over the place from last night. I hated a mess, but I tried to overlook it when Nan wanted to party.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to do that. Henrietta will be here tomorrow,‚Äù I said, hating to see her clean up.  
  
¬† She put the bottles in with the trash she had collected and glanced back at me. ‚ÄúI just thought I‚Äôd help out.‚Äù  
  
¬† I was calling her father this morning. I needed to get her out of here. Until then, I had to make sure she hated me. ‚ÄúI already have a housekeeper. I‚Äôm not looking to hire another one, if that is what you‚Äôre thinking.‚Äù The harsh tone in my own voice made me want to wince, but I kept the bored look on my face. I had perfected it years ago. I could not look at her right now.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo. I know that. I was just trying to be helpful. You let me sleep in your house last night.‚Äù Her voice was soft and pleading, as if she needed me to believe her. Fuck that.  
  
¬† We needed to set some ground rules before I fucked up. ‚ÄúAbout that. We need to talk.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOK,‚Äù she said in a whisper. Dammit, why did she look so defeated again? I hadn‚Äôt kicked her damn puppy.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like your father. He‚Äôs a mooch. My mother always tends to find men like him. It‚Äôs her talent. But I‚Äôm thinking you may already know this about him. Which makes me curious. Why did you come to him for help if you knew what he was like?‚Äù I needed her to tell me something real. Or I needed to catch her in a lie. I couldn‚Äôt keep her here much longer. Those fucking long legs of hers and her big blue eyes were driving me crazy .  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMy mother just passed away. She had cancer. Three years‚Äô worth of treatments add up. The only thing we owned was the house my grandmother left us. I had to sell the house and everything else to pay off all my mother‚Äôs medical bills. I haven‚Äôt seen my dad since he walked out on us five years ago. But he‚Äôs the only family I have left. I had no one else to ask for help. I need a place to stay until I can find a job and get a few paychecks. Then I‚Äôll get my own place. I never intended to be around long. I knew my dad wouldn‚Äôt want me here.‚Äù She paused and laughed, but it wasn‚Äôt real. It was filled with pain, which only twisted my gut. ‚ÄúAlthough I never expected him to run off before I arrived.‚Äù  
  
¬† Holy fucking hell. I was going to kill Abe Wynn. The motherfucker had abandoned his daughter while she took care of her ill mother? What kind of sick monster did that shit? I couldn‚Äôt kick her out. I was, however, about to make Abe‚Äôs life a living hell. The asshole was going to pay for this. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry to hear about your mom,‚Äù I managed to say through the blood boiling in my veins. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs got to be rough. You said she was sick for three years. So since you were sixteen?‚Äù She‚Äôd been a kid. He‚Äôd left her, and she‚Äôd just been a kid.  
  
¬† She simply nodded and watched me cautiously.  
  
\> ¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre planning on getting a job and a place of your own,‚Äù I said, wanting to remind myself that this was her plan. I could help her long enough so that she could achieve this. Someone needed to help her, dammit. She was fucking alone. ‚ÄúThe room under the stairs is yours for one month. You should be able to find a job and get enough money together to find an apartment. Destin isn‚Äôt too far from here, and the cost of living is more affordable there. If our parents return before that time, I expect your father will be able to help you out.‚Äù  
  
¬† She let out a small sigh, and her shoulders sagged. ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù  
  
¬† I couldn‚Äôt look at her. It made me want to murder Abe with my bare hands. Right now, I couldn‚Äôt focus on Nan and her need for a father. The man she wanted as a father was a bastard. A bastard I was gonna make pay for this shit. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got some things to do. Good luck on the job hunt,‚Äù I said, before walking away from her. I had a phone call to make.  
  
¬† CHAPTER FOUR  
  
¬† I let the phone ring three times before hanging up and dialing again. I would call my mother‚Äôs phone until she answered. She‚Äôd better not fuck with me, or I would turn the damn thing off and cancel her credit cards. She‚Äôd be calling me then.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHonestly, Rush, is it really necessary to call me incessantly? If I don‚Äôt answer, leave a message, and I will return your calls when it‚Äôs convenient for me.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt give a shit about your convenience. I want to talk to the motherfucker you‚Äôre married to. Now.‚Äù  
  
¬† Mom huffed into the phone. ‚ÄúI most certainly will not listen to my son talk to me that way, or to my husband. You can call back when you‚Äôre ready to speak with respect and‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMom, so help me God, if you don‚Äôt put that man on the phone, your phone and credit cards will be shut down within the next ten minutes. Do not fuck with me.‚Äù  
  
¬† That shut her up. Her sharp inhalation was the only response I got.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNow, Mom,‚Äù I repeated firmly.  
  
¬† There was muffled whispering before I heard Abe clear his throat. ‚ÄúHello,‚Äù he said, as if he wasn‚Äôt ignoring the fact that he had abandoned his daughter.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúUnderstand one thing. I control it all. The money. My mother. Everything. It‚Äôs mine. You fuck with me, and you will be cut off. I brought you here because I love my sister. But you‚Äôre showing me that you‚Äôre not worth her time. Now, explain to me how you told your other daughter to come to my house and then just left the motherfucking country.‚Äù  
  
¬† Abe paused, and I heard him take a deep breath. ‚ÄúI forgot she was coming.‚Äù  
  
¬† The fuck he did. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs here now, dipshit, and she needs help. You and my mother need to get on a plane and get your asses back here.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt seen her in five years. I don‚Äôt . . . I don‚Äôt know what to say to her. She‚Äôs an adult now. She can make her own way. I shouldn‚Äôt have told her to come to your house, but I needed to tell her something. She was begging for help. If you don‚Äôt want her there, then send her away. She‚Äôs a smart girl. She has a gun. She‚Äôll survive. She‚Äôs a survivor.

1lscqql,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lscqql,Pairing Chronicles #190: Large cigar and small coffee,"As much as I love pairing cigars with coffee, a decent coffee shouldn't take more than 10 minutes to finish, while a cigar can last so much, especially if it's a Partagas Lusitania like the one I smoked yesterday. When smoking it I remembered something a so-called habanos expert once told me when I asked him why he always used the word creamy to describe flavors. I had always thought it was related to the cream flavor, as in vanilla and a sort of milky component, but he told me that in cigars this meant when the smoke texture is kind of oily and the flavors stick to the palate for a long time. That sort of creaminess came to mind often when smoking the Lusitanias. 

Even this coffee being a macchiato, the pairing was great thanks to the flavors of vanilla, pepper, oak, nuts and chocolate in the Lusi, while the coffee had all the creamy texture that kept those flavors on the palate as long as possible, and the milky flavors I assumed originally. 

I realized that coffee can pair with one of the thirds and not necessarily the whole thing. I paired this macchiato with the first third of the cigar and then went into some sparkling water and the result was amazing. Here's another experimenting I'm going to go into, with each third of the cigar. ",3,1751730047.0,EveryDayIsCigarDay,0,1.0,False

The dawn broke in ribbons of scarlet and gold across the Caribbean sky, as if the sun had taken up a pirate‚Äôs brush and painted its flag across the clouds. From the cliffs of Isla del Le√≥n, Captain Isabella Roja watched it unfold in silence. The sea below glistened with restless beauty, but her eyes were focused beyond the horizon, beyond the waves and wind, toward a storm she could feel gathering, even if the sky was clear.

She was no longer the reckless firebrand who had once seized a Spanish brig with only a dozen men and a stolen fishing boat. She had become something else, something older, quieter, and far more dangerous. The red coat she wore now was darker than it had been, weathered and worn, trimmed in gold thread taken from a bishop‚Äôs stole and stitched by her own hand. Across the Caribbean, they called her La Reina de los Corsarios. The Queen of Corsairs.

Her ship, Coraz√≥n de Oro, lay anchored in the bay below like a jaguar resting in the sun. The sails were furled, but the crew was already stirring, swabbing the decks, checking powder stores, inspecting cannon braces. They didn‚Äôt need orders to prepare. They felt it too. The air was too still. The birds too quiet.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre up early, Captain.‚Äù The voice behind her was familiar and warm, touched with a Castilian accent softened by sea air. Catalina de Mendoza offered a mug of coffee steeped with chicory and a generous dash of rum.

Isabella accepted it without turning. ‚ÄúStorm‚Äôs coming.‚Äù

Catalina raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúNot a cloud in sight.‚Äù

Isabella sipped. ‚ÄúNot that kind of storm.‚Äù

They stood together in companionable silence, watching the surf churn around the jagged rocks far below.

It had been six months since the duel in the golden temple, since Valdez had vanished into the abyss beneath the Heart of Gold. They had returned not as thieves, but as victors. And yet, peace had never truly followed. Restlessness itched beneath Isabella‚Äôs skin like salt on a wound.

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt sleep,‚Äù Catalina said.

‚ÄúI dreamed,‚Äù Isabella replied. ‚ÄúDreamed of waves that rose like towers. Of ships split in half with no cannonfire. And of a mask‚Ä¶ floating in the dark.‚Äù

Catalina's mouth tightened. She knew the look in Isabella‚Äôs eyes: not fear, but recognition.

Before she could speak, footsteps echoed behind them. It was Diego, first mate and grizzled survivor of a hundred battles. His thick mustache bristled like a storm flag in the wind.

‚ÄúCaptain,‚Äù he said, holding out a scroll of rough parchment. ‚ÄúThis came in on the tide. Drifted in a bottle. Sealed with coral wax. We found it wedged in the anchor chain.‚Äù

Isabella took it slowly. The wax was crusted with salt and embedded with fragments of tiny shells. She broke it and unrolled the message. Her jaw clenched as she read.

La Reina del Abismo has risen. If you wish to keep your crown, bring what you stole and come alone. Isla del Diablo. Full moon.

‚ÄúAnother pretender?‚Äù Catalina asked, frowning.

‚ÄúOr worse,‚Äù Diego muttered. ‚ÄúThat place‚Ä¶ sailors say it eats ships.‚Äù

Isabella‚Äôs voice was quiet but certain. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a challenge for gold. It‚Äôs for legacy. The throne.‚Äù

Catalina glanced at her. ‚ÄúYou think it‚Äôs Valdez?‚Äù

‚ÄúI thought so. But this‚Ä¶ this feels older. Something deeper than revenge. This is about power.‚Äù

She handed the message to Catalina. The younger woman read it, her face hardening. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not going alone.‚Äù

‚ÄúI must,‚Äù Isabella said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what the challenge demands.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd since when do you play by the rules of nameless sea ghosts?‚Äù Catalina snapped. ‚ÄúWe face this together, or not at all.‚Äù

A gull shrieked above them. Down on the deck, the crew was watching now, sensing something unfolding. The wind had changed slightly, but enough for every sailor to taste it. The scent of distant rain. The breath of another world.

Isabella folded the parchment and tucked it into her coat. She stepped past Catalina and Diego, boots crunching in the gravel, her crimson coat flaring like a banner behind her.

‚ÄúPrepare the ship,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe sail at moonrise. But the longboats go ashore with me alone. Diego, make sure we‚Äôre shadowed but unseen. Catalina, memorize every current around Isla del Diablo. We may need to run.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd if we don‚Äôt?‚Äù Catalina asked.

Isabella didn‚Äôt stop walking. ‚ÄúThen we find out who dares to summon a queen.‚Äù

Chapter 2: Isla del Diablo

The moon hung low, heavy and full, casting a silver sheen over the restless Caribbean. The Coraz√≥n de Oro lay quiet in the hidden cove, its silhouette a shadow among shadows. Isabella stood at the prow of a small longboat, the oars cutting through the dark water with a rhythm like a whispered chant.

She rowed alone, the sea chill seeping through her gloves, her breath rising in soft puffs that dissolved into the night. Behind her, cloaked figures watched from the tree line, just beyond the rim of the beach‚ÄîCatalina and Diego, guardians hidden in the mist.

The island loomed ahead, a jagged black tooth rising from the waves, crowned by the ancient tower that seemed carved from the night itself. The wind was strangely still; the usual chorus of nocturnal life was muted, as if the island held its breath.

Isabella‚Äôs boots struck dry bones scattered across the sand‚Äîfish and birds, but something else as well, the brittle remains of men long lost to the sea. She swallowed a sudden unease and made for the tower, her crimson coat a stark slash of color against the pale sand.

The stones of the tower were cold and rough, etched with symbols that defied her memory and logic. Spirals that seemed to move beneath her gaze. Jaguars with eyes that glimmered like stars. Serpents coiled in silent prayer. The air tasted of salt and ancient magic, a weight that pressed against her skin.

At the center of a coral ring flickered a low fire, blue and green flames dancing like drowned spirits. A figure stepped from the shadows‚Äîa woman swathed in kelp and silk, her pale skin shimmering with a wet sheen, her black hair tangled with seaweed and barnacles. Her eyes glowed faintly in the firelight, sharp and cold as the abyss.

‚ÄúCaptain Roja,‚Äù the woman said, her voice a melodic echo, like waves lapping on hidden shores. ‚ÄúOr shall I call you Queen?‚Äù

Isabella met her gaze without flinching. ‚ÄúIsabella will do. And you are?‚Äù

‚ÄúLuc√≠a,‚Äù the woman replied, stepping closer. ‚ÄúDrowned Queen to some, Sea‚Äôs Daughter to others, but to all... Reina del Abismo.‚Äù

Luc√≠a‚Äôs gaze flicked to the ring of coral, then to the dark water beyond, where the tide whispered secrets no human was meant to hear.

‚ÄúYou carry what should never have left this place. The key‚Äîsplit in two, stolen from the Temple of the Sun and from the man who vanished beneath the waves.‚Äù

Isabella‚Äôs voice dropped to a growl. ‚ÄúYou mean Valdez.‚Äù

Luc√≠a‚Äôs smile was a curve of shadow and salt. ‚ÄúHe fancied himself a storm, but he was only thunder. Loud, frightening, but without the power to strike. The Abyss waits for the one who can wield the lightning.‚Äù

From her cloak, Luc√≠a drew forth a mask‚Äîcrafted of coral, shaped like waves frozen in stone, gilded with gold filigree that shimmered like the crest of a rising tide. It was both beautiful and terrible, a relic of powers lost and promises broken.

‚ÄúThis was made for the one who would awaken the Abyss,‚Äù Luc√≠a said softly. ‚ÄúThe one who would wear the sea‚Äôs crown and command the depths.‚Äù

Isabella‚Äôs fingers itched to grasp it, but a voice inside warned caution. ‚ÄúWhy me? Why not the man who vanished beneath it all?‚Äù

Luc√≠a‚Äôs eyes glimmered with sadness and something colder still. ‚ÄúBecause your blood runs defiant. Your father fled this place, but you carry his fire. The sea has called to you, whispered your name beneath the waves. And the Abyss answers only to those who dare claim it.‚Äù

The wind shifted suddenly, carrying the scent of brine and ancient coral. Somewhere in the distance, a low sound rose, half song, half warning from the depths.

Isabella stepped forward, her voice steady despite the chill in her bones. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt come here to bargain with ghosts or drown in legends. If the sea wants a queen, she‚Äôll get one who stands on her own terms.‚Äù

Luc√≠a‚Äôs eyes narrowed. ‚ÄúThen you will choose. Wear the mask, open the Gate of Tides, and take your place. Or walk away and let the Abyss rise unchecked.‚Äù

The night closed around them, the silence waiting for Isabella‚Äôs answer like the calm before a storm.

Chapter 3: The Depths Below

The Coraz√≥n de Oro slipped silently from the hidden cove, cutting westward beneath the cold light of a strange and distant constellation. The sea, usually alive with restless energy, was unnervingly calm‚Äîan endless glassy plain that mirrored the cold stars overhead.

Catalina stood at the helm, the night wind tugging at her cloak, her sharp eyes scanning the horizon. The salt air was thick with unspoken fears, the kind that gnawed at the edges of every sailor‚Äôs courage. Behind her, Diego moved through the crew like a shadow, murmuring prayers to the Virgin Mary, to Yemaya, goddess of the seas, and to every patron saint who might listen.

‚ÄúToo quiet,‚Äù Diego muttered under his breath, the words slipping into the darkness like a warning.

The men exchanged uneasy glances, their hands never far from weapons or rigging. Even the usual creaks and groans of the ship seemed swallowed by the stillness.

Then, without warning, the wind died.

The Coraz√≥n de Oro drifted, held fast by a sea that flattened beneath her like a sheet of polished obsidian. The stars reflected perfectly in the dark waters, making the horizon disappear, leaving ship and crew suspended between sky and abyss.

Isabella stood near the stern, the mask Luc√≠a had pressed into her palm still cool against her skin. Her breath came steady, the weight of the moment settling deep into her bones.

From below the surface came a faint glow, eerie and unnatural. The water began to bubble and pulse with a strange bioluminescent light‚Äîcoral and creatures awash in blue-green fire that rippled like a heartbeat beneath the waves.

A deep rumble rose from the depths, growing louder until it became a roar, shaking the hull of the ship with its power.

Luc√≠a stepped forward, barefoot and silent, her eyes fixed on Isabella. She raised the coral mask, holding it like a sacred offering.

‚ÄúNow,‚Äù Luc√≠a said, voice clear as the ringing of a bell in the dark. ‚ÄúSeal it, or open it. The choice is yours.‚Äù

Isabella‚Äôs fingers tightened around the mask as the ocean before them began to churn violently. The sea roared, spewing a towering column of water that glimmered with ancient light.

From the heart of the eruption, a tower rose‚Äîblack volcanic rock encrusted with barnacles, crusted in coral carved like twisting serpents and sun symbols glowing faintly beneath the waves.

The Gate of Tides.

The crew watched in awe and fear, the magic of the moment pressing heavy upon them.

Catalina‚Äôs voice was steady but full of awe. ‚ÄúWhatever you decide, I‚Äôm with you.‚Äù

Diego‚Äôs hands clenched in silent prayer, eyes never leaving the glowing tower.

Isabella stepped forward, the mask now warm in her grip. She slipped it over her face, the coral pressing cool but alive against her skin. The world seemed to shift‚Äîthe air thickened, the water‚Äôs pulse syncing with her heartbeat.

The ocean‚Äôs song filled her ears‚Äîa siren‚Äôs call woven from power, promise, and danger.

In that moment, she felt the legacy of the sea surge through her veins‚Äîthe defiance of her father, the fury of the storm, the weight of the abyss.

The choice lay before her.

Chapter 4: The Sunken Court

The tower loomed above the Coraz√≥n de Oro, a monolith of black stone and coral rising from the depths like the spine of some ancient leviathan. Water poured from its sides in glimmering cascades, falling into the sea like silver curtains. No one spoke as Isabella stepped into the longboat and rowed toward the base, Luc√≠a at her side, barefoot and silent.

Catalina followed in a second boat, knuckles white around the hilt of her cutlass, eyes never leaving Isabella‚Äôs back.

The entrance was a yawning arch of volcanic stone, carved with images that shimmered under the moonlight. Gods with weeping eyes, waves swallowing cities, serpents encircling the sun. Sea creatures fled from the tower‚Äôs shadow as if remembering an ancient grief.

The longboats passed through the arch and into darkness.

Inside, the world changed. The air grew thick, the temperature dropped, and a hush fell over everything. The walls glowed with drifting orbs of pale blue light. Neither flame nor firefly, but something older, something that breathed. They hovered in the gloom like jellyfish, illuminating the carvings that danced in the flickering light: sunken temples, crowned queens with coral masks, and thrones carved from the bones of whales.

The passage led deeper into the heart of the tower until it opened into a vast circular chamber, a drowned cathedral of stone and memory.

At its center stood a throne carved from fossilized shell and barnacle, half-swallowed by time. In it sat the remains of a man, once tall, broad-shouldered, now slumped and sun-bleached. One arm was still wrapped in a crimson sash, the fabric tattered and faded.

Isabella stopped, the mask slipping from her fingers.

‚ÄúMy father,‚Äù she said, her voice barely audible.

Luc√≠a bowed her head. ‚ÄúHe came seeking to close what he had once helped open. But the key was not whole. He was not chosen.‚Äù

Catalina stepped closer, the echo of her boots muffled by moss and dust. She placed a hand on Isabella‚Äôs shoulder, steady and strong.

‚ÄúI never believed he was just another pirate,‚Äù Catalina murmured. ‚ÄúHe knew too much. Carried something in his silence.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe carried guilt,‚Äù Isabella said. ‚ÄúAnd left me the weight.‚Äù

They stood before the basin, a low stone circle filled with water as still as glass. Beneath its surface, faint shapes moved. Serpents perhaps. Or shadows older than breath.

Luc√≠a turned to face them both. ‚ÄúThe sea is changing. The old gods stir in their sleep. Storms rise where none should. Ships vanish into calm waters. The Abyss is not content to slumber. If we do not guide it, it will consume us all.‚Äù

She lifted the crown.

It was beautiful and terrible. A circlet of coral and gold, forged in the shape of crashing waves and crested with emeralds like frozen tears. It pulsed faintly, as though it still remembered being part of something living.

‚ÄúRule with me,‚Äù Luc√≠a said. ‚ÄúTake the sea as your throne. Guide it. Bind it. It will obey only one who walks between storm and silence.‚Äù

The offer hung in the air like thunder waiting to strike.

Isabella stared at the crown. Her breath caught, her heart hammering. The power in the room was tangible, an intoxicating lure. She could feel it humming beneath her skin, promising dominion over wind and wave. No more hiding. No more watching fleets bear the flags of tyrants. The sea itself would kneel.

But then she looked at Catalina. At the quiet strength in her eyes. The doubt. The love.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Isabella said, and her voice cracked like a whip in the silence. ‚ÄúThe sea is not a throne. It is a promise. Wild. Free. Not to be ruled.‚Äù

She took the crown from Luc√≠a‚Äôs hands. It was heavier than it looked. Alive.

And she turned.

Without a word, she hurled it into the basin.

The water exploded in a column of white light. The tower shook, ancient coral crumbling from the ceiling. The sea groaned, as if in pain or relief.

When the light faded, the basin was empty. The orbs above flickered and dimmed. The carvings on the wall stilled.

And the gate was shut.

Forever.

Luc√≠a staggered, her expression unreadable, part sorrow, part awe. She turned her gaze to Isabella and gave a slow, solemn nod.

‚ÄúThe sea will remember,‚Äù she whispered.

‚ÄúSo will I,‚Äù Isabella said.

Epilogue: The Whispering Reef

Far from any charted waters, where the sea deepens into an indigo no ink can capture, lies a reef that no ship dares cross twice.

It has no name on any map, but sailors call it La Corona de Silencio, the Crown of Silence.

The reef rises unexpectedly from the abyss, its jagged coral towers sculpted into impossible shapes. Arches like the ribs of beasts, spirals that catch the moonlight, spires that hum when the tide is right. No birds land there. No fish linger. The current changes when ships approach, as if the ocean itself remembers.

At its heart stands a stone column, crusted in salt and coral. Upon it is carved a single image.

A crowned wave.

There are stories whispered in harbors from Tortuga to Havana. Of a crimson-coated captain who sails where compasses spin wild. Of a ship that vanishes into fog and returns without a scratch. Of sea monsters that turn aside. Of storms that split to let her pass.

Some say she walks the deck barefoot now, sea-glass eyes aglow, crowned in coral.

Others say she gave up the crown, but the sea crowned her anyway.

And somewhere, deep beneath the reef, where the Abyss once stirred, something vast dreams once more. Quieter now, but not gone.

It listens.

It waits.

And sometimes, it whispers her name.

Isabella Roja.

La Reina de los Corsarios.

1lscq8n,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lscq8n,Disappointed in Eureka replacement burrs - options? [$100],"My Eureka Specialita Mignon is about 4 years old. I have noticed it has trouble with some light roasts. I'll adjust finer until the burrs touch, and still get shots that are too fast. I tried to align the burrs and found they are uneven (due to wear i assume). So, time for new burrs. I decided on the Eureka 55mm ""diamond inside"" burrs.

The new burrs have obvious, visible, and sometimes deep surface defects. It is my understanding that these should be precision-machined parts. I got a replacement set, and those too had defects. I contacted customer service and they say ""that's just how they are."" I am hugely disappointed.

I have been searching for third party 55mm burrs and can't find any. I can only find one source for Eureka replacement burrs (VeryBarista, and I am in USA in case that matters).

I feel like I am stuck. Can anyone offer perspective or options? I quite like my grinder, but I like my light roasts even more. For now I am using a 1zpresso j-series and it is great for all coffee, but I didn't get it to be my daily driver.",0,1751730010.0,espresso,6,0.4,False
1lscpx4,https://i.redd.it/x9y8h99ks2bf1.jpeg,Pairing Chronicles #190: Large cigar and small coffee,"As much as I love pairing cigars with coffee, a decent coffee shouldn't take more than 10 minutes to finish, while a cigar can last so much, especially if it's a Partagas Lusitania like the one I smoked yesterday. When smoking it I remembered something a so-called habanos expert once told me when I asked him why he always used the word creamy to describe flavors. I had always thought it was related to the cream flavor, as in vanilla and a sort of milky component, but he told me that in cigars this meant when the smoke texture is kind of oily and the flavors stick to the palate for a long time. That sort of creaminess came to mind often when smoking the Lusitanias. 

Even this coffee being a macchiato, the pairing was great thanks to the flavors of vanilla, pepper, oak, nuts and chocolate in the Lusi, while the coffee had all the creamy texture that kept those flavors on the palate as long as possible, and the milky flavors I assumed originally. 

I realized that coffee can pair with one of the thirds and not necessarily the whole thing. I paired this macchiato with the first third of the cigar and then went into some sparkling water and the result was amazing. Here's another experimenting I'm going to go into, with each third of the cigar. ",3,1751729987.0,cafe,0,1.0,False

We hit it up quite a bit and decided to meet casually for a coffee date. During the meet while we were talking about a lot of things, my date saw someone walking in the coffee shop with a tattoo and was offended by it as it had something related to Lucifer. He did express his concern about that and then the whole discussion turned into religion. He then proceeded to ask me what religion I belong to, even though all of that was listed on my profile (I belong to a non-abrahamic religion). When I explained my religion/religious beliefs and all then he proceeded to ask me about if Im okay to convert to Christianity if we proceeded further. I was honest and said that Im indifferent about religion and I wouldn‚Äôt be comfortable to convert as I don‚Äôt believe in all that. Things went south after that as he said to me that he cant foresee us dating as he wants to share his spirituality with his partner but did offer to hookup with me. I politely decided and returned home.

If anyone has any recommendations near our route please drop some suggestions! This is just a list of stuff we‚Äôre particularly interested in :)

* Culture: Local attractions, art events/shops, historic museums/monuments

* Funny/strange things that make you say ‚ÄúWow, only in \_\_\_\_\_.‚Äù

**Why This Pick?**

This will be a high-scoring affair in my opinion, friends. Boston starter Walker Buehler (6.45 ERA) is currently sporting a staggering 9.49 ERA on the road and has allowed 17 ERs over just his last 3 starts. On the other side, 3 of Washington starter Mitchell Parker‚Äôs (4.63 ERA) last 4 outings have seen game totals of at least 11 runs. And lastly, the Nationals‚Äô last 7 straight games have seen final totals of at least 11. My money‚Äôs on the Over to cash in spades here.

1lscn0p,https://www.reddit.com/r/travelblog/comments/1lscn0p/travel_guide_for_monteverde_costa_rica/,Travel Guide for Monteverde Costa Rica,"I made a full travel guide to Monteverde, Costa Rica. If you‚Äôre into nature, unique places and being outside just add it to your list of places to visit.

Quick breakdown:

**How to get there:**  
You can drive from San Jos√© or La Fortuna. Roads are paved most of the way, but the last stretch is rough, expect gravel and potholes. A 4x4 isn‚Äôt 100% necessary but helps.

**What to pack:**  
Bring layers. It gets chilly at night. You‚Äôll want a rain jacket, good shoes for hiking, and long sleeves for the cloud forest. Bottle of water probably.

**Best things to do:**

* Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve: well-marked trails, wildlife, hanging bridges
* Santa Elena Cloud Forest: cheaper, quieter, more rustic
* San Luis Waterfall: scenic hike through farmland and forest
* Night walk tours: you‚Äôll see more animals than in the daytime
* Butterfly garden and hummingbird gallery if you want something easy

**Where to stay:**

* Budget: Cabinas Vista Al Golfo
* Mid-range: Hotel El Bosque
* More comfortable: Hotel Belmar

**Food spots:**

* Sabor Tico for local food
* Orchid Coffee for breakfast or lunch
* Taco Taco for casual dinner

You can use the whole guide or just take what you need. Cheers.

1lscm5y,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1lscm5y/my_blood_approves_by_amanda_hocking/,My Blood Approves by Amanda Hocking:,"¬†The goose bumps stood all over Jane‚Äôs shoulder and she stomped her foot, at least partially because of the cold. She‚Äôd claim it was only because of her frustration over the line and insist that chain smoking cigarettes kept her warm.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThis is truly infuriating,‚Äù Jane said, flicking her cigarette to the dampened sidewalk and smashing it with her stilettoed boot.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMaybe we should just call it a night,‚Äù I suggested.  
  
¬† Our fake IDs had not been as impressive as Jane‚Äôs connection had promised, and this would be the third club we‚Äôd be turned away from, if we ever managed to make it to the door.  
  
¬† Since we were going out, I had allowed Jane to dress me, so everything was ill-fitting and far too revealing for the Minnesota night. A heavy mist settled over us, but she refused to shiver or admit that any of this fazed her. Her plan was to get crazy drunk and hook up with somebody completely random, and I couldn‚Äôt reason with her.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo!‚Äù Jane shook her head. ‚ÄúI have a good feeling about this place.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs after midnight, Jane.‚Äù The pair of heels I borrowed from her caused permanent damage to my feet, and I shifted my weight to ease the pain.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI just want to dance and be stupid!‚Äù She started whining, making her seem much younger than seventeen so we‚Äôd be even less likely to get into the club. ‚ÄúCome on, Alice! This is what being young is all about!‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI really hope not,‚Äù I muttered. Waiting in line for hours and getting declined from clubs did not sound like a good time. ‚ÄúWe can try again next weekend. I promise. It‚Äôll give us more time to find better ID‚Äôs.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even have any alcohol.‚Äù Her expression had gone all pouty, but I knew that she was starting to cave.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure we can find some somewhere,‚Äù I said  
  
¬† Jane could find alcohol the way I found water. She had nothing to complain about. Wherever Jane went, a party was sure to follow.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúFine.‚Äù Sighing, she stepped out of line and headed in the direction towards my apartment, away from the bright lights of the clubs and drunken people smoking cigarettes. ‚ÄúBut you owe me.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhy do I owe you?‚Äù I demanded.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúFor making me leave early.‚Äù  
  
¬† We‚Äôd made it a few feet from the line when I couldn‚Äôt take it any longer. I stopped and ripped off the borrowed shoes, preferring to walk barefoot on the dirty cement than risk any more blisters. Most likely, I‚Äôd get gum or something in a fresh wound and end up with typhoid or rabies, but it still seemed like a better option.  
  
¬† We walked far enough away from the clubs where it started to feel deserted, and two teenage girls walking around in downtown Minneapolis wasn‚Äôt the safest thing in the world.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe should get a cab soon,‚Äù I suggested.  
  
¬† Jane shook her head, negating cab ideas. We didn‚Äôt have very much money, so the farther we walked, the shorter the cab ride would be. I lived by Loring Park, which really wasn‚Äôt that far from where we were, but it still wasn‚Äôt within walking distance.  
  
¬† A green and white taxi sailed past us, and I gazed longingly after it.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe need the exercise anyway,‚Äù Jane said, noticing my expression.  
  
¬† I don‚Äôt know why I ever agreed to her shenanigans. They were always much more fun for her then they were for me. Being the less sexy sidekick wasn‚Äôt a very glamorous life.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBut my feet hurt,‚Äù I said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBeauty is-‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚Äú-pain, yeah, yeah, I get it,‚Äù I grumbled, cutting her off.  
  
¬† Jane lit another cigarette, and we walked in silence. I knew she was sulking about the club and trying to plot some exciting adventure to drag me into, but I wouldn‚Äôt fall for it this time.  
  
¬† The sound of the traffic from Hennepin Avenue had faded enough where I could hear the footfalls echo behind us. Jane seemed oblivious, but I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling we were being followed.  
  
¬† Then the footsteps behind us started to hurry up, becoming heavier and louder, combined with the sound of ragged breathing and hushed male voices.  
  
¬† Jane looked over at me, and the panic in her eyes meant that she heard them too. Out of the two of us, she was braver and stole a look back over her shoulder at them.  
  
¬† I was about to ask her what she saw when she started sprinting forward, and that was answer enough for me. I tried to catch up to her, but she wasn‚Äôt about to slow down for me, remaining a few steps ahead.  
  
¬† The street ended with a parking garage, and Jane ran into it, and rather dumbly, I followed her. There had to be other places with crowds, but her first choice had been a dimly lit underground parking garage.  
  
¬† I allowed myself a look back for the first time. In the darkness, I could see little more than the silhouettes of four large men. When they saw me looking at them, one of them started to cat call.  
  
¬† I ran forward, only to realize Jane wasn‚Äôt in front of me. I didn‚Äôt have a very good fight or flight reflex, so I just froze when I didn‚Äôt see her.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOver here!‚Äù Jane hissed, but the acoustics in the garage were awful. I couldn‚Äôt tell where her voice was coming from, so I just stood frozen underneath a flickering yellow light and hoped that my death would be quick and painless.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHey little girl,‚Äù one of the guys purred in a voice that sounded anything but friendly.  
  
¬† I turned to face them. Since I had stopped running, so had they, and they strolled over to me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDo you always run from a good time?‚Äù another one asked. For some reason, the rest of them thought that was hilarious, and their laughter filled the garage.  
  
¬† The hair on the back of my neck stood up, and I opened my mouth to say something, maybe even scream, but nothing came out. I stood in a pool of cold water and oil, and the light above me decided to go out for good.  
  
¬† Closing my eyes against the dark, I didn‚Äôt want to risk seeing anything they did to me. They talked amongst themselves, laughing and making perverted jokes, and I knew I was going to die.  
  
¬† Somewhere behind me, I heard the screech of tires, but I just squeezed my eyes shut tighter.  
  
¬† \-2-  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHey! What are you doing?‚Äù a voice shouted to the side of me. As soon as I heard him speak, I knew that it didn‚Äôt belong to the group of guys closing in on me, and I opened my eyes.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs it to you?‚Äù a large tattooed guy growled, but he started taking a step back. A car had pulled in the parking space to my right, shining the bright headlights past me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI think you should just back off,‚Äù the new voice said.  
  
¬† I peeked over to the side at him, but the shadows from the headlights hid him. It was too dark for me to make anything out, except his pink tee shirt.  
  
¬† He took another step forward, and my would-be-attackers continued taking steps back. They weren‚Äôt moving very fast enough, and then suddenly, the blur of the pink shirt rushed towards them.  
  
¬† The darkness and my fear couldn‚Äôt let me trust my eyesight anymore. It looked as if the pink shirt was moving faster than humanly possible, and the guys yelled as he pushed them, sending them flying out of the garage.  
  
¬† I blinked my eyes to adjust them  
better, and then everyone was gone.  
  
¬† Not everyone, exactly. The light above me flickered on again, and the guy in the pink shirt stood next to me. In big black letters across his chest, his shirt read, ‚ÄúReal men wear pink.‚Äù  
  
¬† He looked older than me, probably in his early twenties, and he wasn‚Äôt particularly well-built or tall. In fact, he leaned more towards wiry than he did muscular, and I couldn‚Äôt imagine what had frightened off the other guys.  
  
¬† His face was open and friendly, and he had an easy smile that I couldn‚Äôt help but respond to, even though I had just been a few moments away from death.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù he asked, appraising me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said in a voice that barely sounded like my own. ‚ÄúYou saved my life.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt be out here alone,‚Äù he replied, completely ignoring the fact that he‚Äôd done anything heroic.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMy friend Jane is around here somewhere.‚Äù  
  
¬† I remembered Jane and looked around for her. Part of me was angry that she had done nothing to save me, but then again, neither had I, and I didn‚Äôt think that I should hold her to a higher standard than I did myself.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúTwo girls?‚Äù He raised an eyebrow.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI think Jane has mace,‚Äù I added lamely.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhere is this alleged friend?‚Äù He took his turn scanning the parking lot, and then pointed to something by a van parked on the other side. ‚ÄúI think I see her over there.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhere?‚Äù I squinted at where he pointed but couldn‚Äôt see anything.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOver there,‚Äù he repeated, taking a step towards the black Jetta parked next to me. ‚ÄúCome on. We‚Äôll go over and pick her up, and then I‚Äôll give you guys a ride.‚Äù  
  
¬† I walked around to the passenger side of the car, and it never occurred to me to say no. Something about him made me trust him.  
  
¬† His car stereo played Weezer, and in the glow of the blue dashboard lights, I got my first real good look at him. His skin looked flawless, but his hair was perfectly disheveled.  
  
¬† He sped off across the parking lot, and I pulled my eyes away from him to look out the window. Jane cowered down behind a white van, and I wondered if she‚Äôd bothered to call the police or anything. He stopped the car next to her and rolled down the window so he could lean out.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúJane?‚Äù he said, and she turned to look at him.  
  
¬† I expected her to be afraid, maybe even bolt and run after what had just happened. Instead, she gave him the strangest look. It was almost as if she was in awe.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHi,‚Äù Jane said. It wasn‚Äôt her normal flirty voice, even though I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs what she was trying for.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúJane, he‚Äôs giving us a ride,‚Äù I said when it appeared she would just stand there staring at him. ‚ÄúGet in the car.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSure.‚Äù She smiled at him before sliding into the backseat.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù I looked back at her.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm great,‚Äù Jane said, still gaping at him. ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs your friend here?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt actually know,‚Äù I admitted, looking over at him.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Jack,‚Äù he said, filling in the blank. ‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre Jane.‚Äù Then he looked over at me. ‚ÄúAnd you are?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAlice.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWell, I don‚Äôt know about you guys, but I could really go for a cup of coffee right about now.‚Äù Jack dropped the car into gear and sped off without waiting for either of us to respond. It wasn‚Äôt really a question anyway, and neither one of us would‚Äôve protested.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThis is a really nice car,‚Äù Jane said, and her voice had fully regained that sickeningly sweet tone. Jack didn‚Äôt say anything, and the silence started to feel awkward.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIs this Weezer?‚Äù I asked, just to say something.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Jack nodded.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI like that song ‚ÄòPork ‚Äòn Beans.‚Äô‚Äù As soon as I mentioned the song, Jack quickly flipped it to the track.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI saw them when they were on tour with Motion City Soundtrack,‚Äù he said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúReally?‚Äù I ignored the annoyed glare Jane gave me and continued. ‚ÄúI really like them. How are they live?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúPretty good,‚Äù Jack shrugged, and turned sharply into the parking lot outside an all night diner.  
  
¬† When we got out of the car, Jane scampered over to him, looping her arm through his. He didn‚Äôt look pleased by it, but he didn‚Äôt pull away either.  
  
¬† Outside in the bright glow of the streetlights, I looked him over again. He had on pair of Dickies shorts, skater socks, and light blue Converse, along with the pink tee shirt. He more closely resembled cotton candy than he did a love interest for Jane.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOh crap,‚Äù I said after I‚Äôd gotten out of the car, and looked down at my dirty, bare feet. Blisters and oil covered them, and I couldn‚Äôt imagine cramming my swollen feet back into Jane‚Äôs shoes.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Jack asked, and then followed my gaze down. ‚ÄúOh. Just don‚Äôt wear shoes.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt not wear shoes.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt see much of another option, but I couldn‚Äôt go into a restaurant without shoes.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou can wait in the car,‚Äù Jane offered up with a smug smile and leaned in closer to Jack, so he pulled his arm free from her and took a step away. She looked a little defeated, but I knew she wouldn‚Äôt give up that easy.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo, you‚Äôll be fine,‚Äù Jack insisted. ‚ÄúIf they hassle you, I‚Äôll take care of them.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat does that even mean?‚Äù I asked, but he‚Äôd already convinced me. After all, I‚Äôd seen the way he chased a gang of unruly guys. The graveyard shift at a Denny‚Äôs rip-off wouldn‚Äôt stand a chance.  
  
¬† As predicted, nobody noticed my lack of footwear. In fact, nobody noticed me, or even Jane. The waitress kept her eyes completely focused on Jack.  
  
¬† He sat down first, and Jane squished up next to him, so he kept moving over until he was plastered up against the window. I sat down across from them, and Jack rested his arms on the table, leaning towards me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat can I get you?‚Äù the waitress asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúJust coffee,‚Äù Jack answered. ‚ÄúOr did you guys want something else?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCoffee‚Äôs fine,‚Äù I said. I was a little hungry, but I felt uncomfortable eating in front of him and Jane.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAre you sure you‚Äôre not hungry?‚Äù Jane asked, running her fingers on his arm, but this time, he actually recoiled from her touch.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNope,‚Äù Jack sighed, then muttered under his breath, ‚Äúbut I wish I was.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù the waitress asked, leaning in closer to hear him.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNothing.‚Äù Jack smiled at her. ‚ÄúJust the coffee.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù I told the waitress when she lingered at our table, and she left to get our order.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThanks again for saving us.‚Äù Jane pressed herself against him. ‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs anything I can do to repay you, just let me know.‚Äù There was definitely something strange going on, but I couldn‚Äôt put my finger on it.  
  
¬† His skin was beach bum tanned, unnatural for people in Minnesota in March. His eyes were a weird blue-gray color, and there was something tremendously boyish about them, about him really, but otherwise, nothing seemed to stand out as overly attractive.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAre you famous or something?‚Äù I blurted out, and Jane looked embarrassed enough for both of us so I didn‚Äôt bother blushing.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù He sounded confused.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúEveryone‚Äôs staring at us. At you,‚Äù I corrected myself.  
  
¬† Jack just shrugged and looked down at the table but didn‚Äôt bother checking to see if I was right.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not famous,‚Äù Jack said. He looked like he wanted to explain things more, but then the waitress appeared with three mugs and a pitcher of coffee.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIs there anything else I can get you?‚Äù the waitress asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre fine, thanks,‚Äù Jane snapped, putting her hand possessively on Jack‚Äôs thigh until the waitress left.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCome on. What‚Äôs going on?‚Äù I rested my arms on the table and leaned in closer to him because I‚Äôd lowered my voice.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have an answer for it.‚Äù Jack picked up the pitcher of coffee and poured a cup for himself and me, and then filled Jane‚Äôs too. ÔøΩ  
ÔøΩÔøΩDo you take cream or sugar in yours?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBoth.‚Äù  
  
¬† I was perfectly capable of doing it myself, but I think he wanted to occupy himself so I would be less likely to notice him hedging the question. He dumped a creamer and two packets of sugar in my coffee, and stirred a creamer in his, then settled back in the booth.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI take cream and sugar too,‚Äù Jane added, and Jack pushed the bowl of creamers and sugar towards her.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre not famous?‚Äù I refused to let it go without a direct answer.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI can assure you that I‚Äôm not famous,‚Äù Jack smiled. This one thing I would say about him; he had to have one of the greatest smiles of all time.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou just look so familiar to me,‚Äù I said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI know, right?‚Äù He gave me a perplexed look that mirrored my own.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSo do I know you from somewhere?‚Äù As soon as I said that, I knew that wasn‚Äôt exactly it either. I could almost guarantee that I‚Äôd never seen him before, but there was something undeniably familiar about him.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not possible,‚Äù he shook his head.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHow is it not possible?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúDid you just move here or something?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs complicated.‚Äù He touched his coffee cup and made like he was going to drink it, but he never even lifted it off the table.  
  
¬† Jane resigned herself to drinking her coffee and watching us talk. She finished one cup and poured herself another.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHow is it complicated?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt just is.‚Äù Jack flashed me another one of his amazing smiles.  
  
¬† Somehow, he managed to look very young, like he was fifteen, while simultaneously looking older than me. It was something about his eyes. They were very young and very old, at the same time.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHow old are you?‚Äù I asked pointedly.  
  
¬† To my surprise, Jack laughed, and I found something even more incredible than his smile. Easily, he had the greatest laugh in the universe. It sounded so clear and perfect.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHow old are you?‚Äù Jack countered, grinning at me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI asked you first.‚Äù I leaned back in my seat, crossing my arms over my chest, and that made him laugh again.

Why does that even matter?‚Äù Jack asked. ‚ÄúYou want to know more.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm seventeen,‚Äù I sighed.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúTwenty-four,‚Äù Jack said with a wry smirk.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you feel a little odd running around with two seventeen year old girls?‚Äù I asked.  
  
¬† In some part of my mind, it did logically seem wrong for a twenty-four-year-old to be picking up two random teenage girls. But sitting here, in the booth with him, nothing felt more natural or safe.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm mature for my age,‚Äù Jane interjected.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAs I recall, if I hadn‚Äôt been around, you would‚Äôve gotten yourself killed.‚Äù He rested his arms on the table, leaning more towards me. ‚ÄúWhat were you doing anyway?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe were trying to get into a club, but my feet were killing me and I just wanted to get home,‚Äù I said. He looked at me for a minute, the serious expression looking out of place on him, and then shook his head and refilled my cup of coffee.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat club were you trying to get into?‚Äù Jack asked, and added cream and sugar to my drink. He had yet to touch his own cup, but I decided not to say anything.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù I shrugged. I just let Jane drag me wherever she wanted to go and hoped that by the end of the night, I managed to make it home in one piece. ‚ÄúWhat were you doing downtown? Clubbing it up?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHardly,‚Äù Jack said. ‚ÄúI was‚Ä¶ getting something to eat.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAt midnight?‚Äù I raised an eyebrow at him.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm kind of a night owl.‚Äù Time must‚Äôve just occurred to him, because he glanced over at a clock hanging on the wall. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs getting really late. I should probably get you home.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm wide awake,‚Äù Jane chirped, but unlucky for her, I didn‚Äôt feel the same way.  
  
¬† Even with the coffee and the adrenaline rush from earlier, I felt very tired. I wanted to continue hanging out with Jack, but my whole body had started to ache, especially my legs and ankles.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm starting to drag.‚Äù To punctuate the statement, I yawned loudly.  
  
¬† Jack paid for the check, even though I tried to make a play for it. It was only a couple bucks, and I was tired, so I didn‚Äôt fight that hard.  
  
¬† When I stood up, my legs fought to give out underneath me, but I managed to stay up on my feet. For a second, though, I thought Jack was going to pick me up and carry me out to the car. Jane must‚Äôve gotten the same idea, because she inserted herself between us.  
  
¬† Almost the instant I sat in his car, I fell asleep. I remember a brief discussion about who he would take home first. I woke up just as Jack pulled up in front of my apartment building. Jane was already gone, so I guess he‚Äôd dropped her off. I‚Äôm not sure how he knew where I lived, but it didn‚Äôt seem important then.  
  
¬† I left Jack outside my brownstone and went up to my apartment. Fortunately, my mom wouldn‚Äôt be home from her shift until after seven a.m., and my younger brother Milo was already asleep in his room.  
  
¬† Painfully, I stripped off the ridiculous get up that Jane had dressed me in and pulled on an oversized tee shirt. I grabbed my cell phone with the full intention of plugging it in, but I collapsed onto my bed with my phone in my hand before I had the chance.  
  
¬† Just as I started passing out, I felt the phone vibrate in my hand, startling me awake.  
  
¬† Sweet dreams :) ‚Äì Jack  
  
¬† The text message was from Jack, and I felt my heart beat faster. Somehow, when I had been sleeping, Jack had gotten my phone number from my cell and programmed his number into mine.  
  
¬† Under other circumstances, that might have been a little creepy, but in this case, it just made me feel happy and relieved. Clicking off my phone, I set it on my bedside table and promptly fell asleep.  
  
¬† \- 3 -  
  
¬† When I woke up, the first thing I noticed, after the painful damage to my feet, were the ten million text messages from Jane. All of them were about Jack, and I felt no urge to reply.  
  
¬† I pulled on sweats, and then stumbled into the bathroom to overdose on painkillers and cover my feet in Neosporin and Band-Aids.  
  
¬† Miraculously, I‚Äôd woken up before two o‚Äôclock in the afternoon, and that meant that my mom was still asleep. She did a graveyard shift as a dispatcher in St. Paul, so she usually made it home at an ungodly hour and then slept all day.  
  
¬† My brother Milo was a studious little bastard though, and he‚Äôd probably been in bed before midnight and up before nine.  
  
¬† When I made it out to the living room, I found him sitting at the computer, probably researching a paper for school even though we were on Spring Break. He was a sophomore in high school and had the social life of a toddler.  
  
¬† It was a sad, sad thing that I was the cool one in the family.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong with you?‚Äù Milo asked, glancing up at me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong with you?‚Äù I countered, utilizing my quick wit.  
  
¬† I had gone into the small adjoined kitchen and poured myself a bowl of Fruity Pebbles. (Scientists haven‚Äôt tested this, but I‚Äôve come to find that a Gatorade, a bowl of Fruity Pebbles, and an Excedrin will cure any hangover.)  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHung over?‚Äù Milo noticed me creating my antidote, and I definitely felt that way.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSomething like that,‚Äù I said.  
  
¬† With my bowl of cereal and lemon-lime sports drink in hand, I flopped on the couch, determined to find either Looney Tunes or a trashy Lifetime movie (the second part of my hang over cure-all).  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat time did you get in last night?‚Äù Milo asked with a hint of disapproval in his voice.  
  
¬† He‚Äôs a year and half years younger than me, but he‚Äôs definitely the parental figure in our relationship. Since Mom‚Äôs always working, and Dad‚Äôs been out of the picture since the beginning of time, I guess one of us had to step up and do it.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù I tried to think, but I couldn‚Äôt actually remember.  
  
¬† After we left the diner, I had pretty much been unconscious the entire time. I only vaguely remembered getting the text from Jack, and I guessed it was somewhere around two or three.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSo what did you end up doing last night?‚Äù Milo had given up on even the pretense of doing something on the computer and tilted his chair towards me.  
  
¬† His dark brown eyes settled on me with their usual mix of curiosity and concern, as if he always half-expected me to admit to shooting up black tar heroin and having sex for money.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNothing,‚Äù I shrugged.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNothing?‚Äù He raised an eyebrow, his suspicion making him look older than he really was. Aside from the baby fat that clung to his cheeks, he could actually pass for being older than me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe couldn‚Äôt get in anywhere,‚Äù I explained through a mouthful of cereal. ‚ÄúSo we just wandered around looking for a club until my feet were completely destroyed, and then we came home.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúJane didn‚Äôt drag you off to some party?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNope.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs very unlike her to end a night without vodka or sex,‚Äù he commented.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLife is full of surprises.‚Äù I had eaten all my cereal, so I drank the rainbowed milk from the bowl and hoped that Milo would let the subject drop. ‚ÄúWhat are you up to today?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThis,‚Äù he shrugged. ‚ÄúYou?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSame.‚Äù I set my bowl down on the coffee table and settled back on the couch. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a movie about a sex addict on Lifetime. Care to watch?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSure.‚Äù He got up from the kitchen chair that sat in front of the computer desk and planted himself at the end of the couch.  
  
¬† I stretched out, resting my battered feet on his lap. He started to say something about the state of them, but then answered his own question by simply saying Jane. We both agreed that she was the source of all my life‚Äôs problems.  
  
¬† We spent the rest of the afternoon camped out on the couch watching a Lifetime movie marathon. Mom got up, showered, and left for work early, citing overtime, but I was never sure if I believed that or not.  
  
¬† Sometimes, I think she just didn‚Äôt like being in the apartment. At this point, it had become more like Milo and I lived on our own. We even did all the grocery shopping, cooking, cleaning,  
laundry, etc. (By ‚Äúwe,‚Äù I mostly mean him. But I did help. Sometimes.)  
  
¬† Around nine, I finally decided that I ought to shower. When I went into my room to gather my clothes, I noticed my cell phone flashing on the table. I had ignored it all day because I had wanted to ignore Jane, but I knew that eventually I‚Äôd have to deal with her.  
  
¬† Much to my surprise, buried underneath the mass of texts from her, I found a text message from Jack.  
  
¬† Motion City Soundtrack tomorrow. First Ave. Seven o‚Äôclock. I‚Äôm buying. You in?  
  
¬† He‚Äôd been paying attention last night when I just casually mentioned liking the band Motion City Soundtrack, and he‚Äôd invited me to a concert. First Ave. was a rather historic little venue downtown, not far off from where he found us.  
  
¬† I knew that if Milo heard about it, his paranoia would kick in, and he'd do everything but forbid me from going. Despite that, I couldn‚Äôt feel that way. Sure, Jack was too old for me, but we weren‚Äôt dating, and I didn‚Äôt really feel like that would become an issue.  
  
¬† I sighed, then quickly responded with, That‚Äôs too much $. I already owe you too much.  
  
¬† Oh be quiet. Money doesn‚Äôt matter. Are you in or not? Jack replied within seconds.  
  
¬† Yeah. But don‚Äôt get in the habit of buying me things. I messaged him back.  
  
¬† Don‚Äôt get in the habit of protesting when I buy you things. ;)  
  
¬† Funny. I replied, hoping it sounded as droll as I wanted it to.  
  
¬† I‚Äôll pick you up at six-thirty. Sound good? That was cutting it awfully close to the time the show started, but he was inviting me, so I‚Äôd play by his rules.  
  
¬† Yeah. See you then. :)  
  
¬† I decided instantly that I couldn‚Äôt tell Jane about this. If hanging out with Jack became a regular thing, I knew I‚Äôd have to tell her. And Milo.  
  
¬† But for now, I thought it‚Äôd be best if I kept it to myself. I couldn‚Äôt keep anyone‚Äôs secrets, not even my own, so I couldn‚Äôt really explain what compelled me to keep this to myself.  
  
¬† I spent the next twenty-four hours avoiding Jane and hedging Milo‚Äôs questions. He had a sixth sense when something was up with me, and it was nearly impossible to keep anything hidden from him.  
  
¬† When I was getting ready to go out, he knew there was a guy involved. I don‚Äôt know how. All I had put on was a slim-fitting hoodie and a pair of jeans, so I don‚Äôt understand what that would give away.  
  
¬† Every time I left Milo home alone at night, I felt terrible. Sure, he was fifteen, and we‚Äôd spent most of our lives alone, but it still never felt right to me.  
  
¬† He didn‚Äôt really want me to go because he didn‚Äôt know what I was up to, but he assured me that he‚Äôd be fine playing World of Warcraft on the computer and he‚Äôd barely even notice I was gone.  
  
¬† Jack arrived promptly at six-thirty, washing away any feelings of guilt or trepidation. As soon as I saw him, I just felt at ease and vaguely contented.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHey,‚Äù Jack smiled broadly when I hopped into his car.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúFor all this.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAll what?‚Äù Jack looked confused as we pulled away from my building, speeding towards First Ave.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThe ride, the tickets, saving my life,‚Äù I elaborated.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOh, that,‚Äù he laughed. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really not a problem. Trust me.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúJust because it wasn‚Äôt a problem for you doesn‚Äôt me that I‚Äôm not grateful,‚Äù I pointed out.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúFair enough,‚Äù he allowed. ‚ÄúWell, you‚Äôre welcome then.‚Äù  
  
¬† Parking downtown should‚Äôve been impossible, but he managed to find a spot half a block away. It was obvious that he could walk much faster than I could, but he kept his pace to match mine, making me feel guilty for holding him up.  
  
¬† It was almost seven when we reached the door, and I knew part of the problem was because I slowed us down. I started to apologize, but he wouldn‚Äôt hear of it.  
  
¬† By the time I saw all the kids inside, I had already resigned myself to standing in the back, unable to catch sight of the band onstage. Jack took my hand to weave us through the crowd, and there was something very odd about his touch.  
  
¬† His skin was neither hot nor cold. It just felt‚Ä¶ temperature-less. Although his skin was tremendously soft, it reminded me of a lizard. The way they can‚Äôt regulate their temperature at all, so they‚Äôre always whatever temperature the room is or whatever‚Äôs touching them.  
  
¬† We made our way up close to the stage, but thanks to my height, it did me little good. When the band came out and the crowd rushed forward, I ended up with my head smooshed into the back of the guy in front of me.  
  
¬† Jack managed to stand his ground, creating a little pocket of unmashedness. He noticed my predicament, and rather deftly, he scooped me up and dropped me on his shoulders, so my legs were straddling his neck.  
  
¬† I became very conscious of the fact that I weighed something over a hundred pounds (the exact amount is irrelevant) and that had to be heavy. Hell, fifty pounds sounded heavy when it‚Äôs sitting on your shoulders.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLet me know if I get too heavy,‚Äù I shouted over the music.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt!‚Äù Jack yelled back, and I knew that was true.  
  
¬† Throughout the entire show (which was spectacular), he never faltered or even hinted at putting me down. When the crowd started to disperse, I was still on his shoulders, and I thought he might carry me out. Instead, he lifted me up off his shoulders and set me on the ground.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHoly cow!‚Äù I said after he‚Äôd put me down. ‚ÄúYou must eat like a double dose of Wheaties every day!‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat are you talking about?‚Äù Jack asked, looking at me like I was insane.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre super strong!‚Äù Without thinking, I reached out and grabbed his bicep, trying to feel some massive amounts of hidden muscle, but honestly, it felt pretty ordinary.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just really light.‚Äù Jack started walking away, attempting to end that line of conversation, but I hurried after him.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your angle?‚Äù I asked, trying to sound more playful than demanding.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIsosceles,‚Äù Jack quipped.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù If Milo had been there, he probably would‚Äôve understood the reference, but geometry wasn‚Äôt my thing.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou asked me what my angle was, so I said isosceles,‚Äù Jack explained, looking down at me to make sure that he wasn‚Äôt losing me in the crowd. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a type of a triangle with two equal sides. I suppose that‚Äôs not really an angle, and I would‚Äôve said something like acute or obtuse, but I thought that would either sound like I was hitting on you or calling you stupid. I should‚Äôve said oblique. That would‚Äôve been good. Damn! I‚Äôm gonna remember that for next time.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the most cryptic person I‚Äôve ever met,‚Äù I sighed.  
  
¬† We stepped outside into the night air, and I pulled my sweatshirt tighter to me, flipping the hood up over my head. Normally, the night air felt refreshing after being all sweaty and crammed with other people on the floor, but since I‚Äôd been on Jack‚Äôs shoulders, I hadn‚Äôt gotten hot at all.  
  
¬† He didn‚Äôt look sweaty from fighting off the mosh pit, and the cold didn‚Äôt seem to affect him either. I was tempted to reach out and take his hand to see what the temperature felt like, but it felt too awkward.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSo, did you have fun?‚Äù Jack asked me as we strolled to his car.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI did,‚Äù I smiled at him. ‚ÄúDid you?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù  
  
¬† There was always this wonderful rush after a good concert, like adrenaline but less panicky. So when they let out, I usually talked a mile a minute about the show, the people, just anything, and everything.  
  
¬† Tonight, though, I fell silent. There were millions of things running through my mind that I wanted to talk about, but very little had to do with the performance I had seen, so I kept my mouth shut.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mean to be cryptic,‚Äù Jack said at length.  
  
¬† We were almost to his car, but he stopped walking and kept his gaze focused on some point straight ahead. His hands were shoved deep in the pocket of his Dickies shorts, and he sighed.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have an angle. Just‚Ä¶‚Äù He looked over at me, as if to make sure  
that I was still listening. I peered up at him from underneath my hood, and he smirked a little. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre cold. We should get in the car.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo! Tell me what you were going to say first!‚Äù I demanded, sounding more forceful than I meant to, but Jack only laughed. Then he went back to staring straight ahead, and his expression went somber.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want you to think that I‚Äôm completely egotistical, cause I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôm just realistic.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre talking about the way all the girls look at you?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Jack said sheepishly. ‚ÄúEveryone kind of‚Ä¶ reacts to me a certain way. And you don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs refreshing. So that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing here. With you.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWait, wait, wait.‚Äù I waved my hands at him, feeling a wave of disappointment. ‚ÄúWhat about the way other people react to you? Why do they do that?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù Jack shifted slightly, and I knew he was lying. He knew exactly what was going on, but he wasn‚Äôt going to tell me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not fair!‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSee?‚Äù Jack smiled. ‚ÄúThis is refreshing. Do you know how many other people argue with me, about anything?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIf you think this is refreshing, just wait.‚Äù I tried to glower at him, but his smile was just too damn infectious.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù Jack started walking towards the car again. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre gonna freeze to death.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúJack!‚Äù I protested but hurried after him. ‚ÄúWhat is it? Is it something in the way you smell that I‚Äôm just not getting?‚Äù He got a look of total surprise and made a clicking sound with his tongue. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWell, yeah, that‚Äôs actually pretty much it,‚Äù Jack admitted. He unlocked his car and then walked around to the other side, still looking a little stunned. I hopped into the car and he continued, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a pheromone or something like that.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSo, wait. Is that a medical condition or something?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah, I guess.‚Äù Jack nodded, as if that answer was sufficient.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat kind of medical condition?‚Äù I pressed, oblivious to the fact that that kind of information was really personal. Something about Jack made me lose any sense of formality.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúA rare one,‚Äù Jack replied flippantly and started the car.

I pick up my wife's coffee order every morning on my way home for work. I am not a coffee drinker so I need some help here.

Her order is an ""XL iced Peanut Butter mocha with cream and sugar."" Every time I go through the drive through and say that it's made correcly. When I try and door dash or direct order through the AJ app though she keeps getting wild results. I only order delivery when I'm not able to order it in person.

I think the problem stems from the dairy selection options. You have to select either none, half and half, milk, and some others. The PB mocha selection further down says it will be with chocolate milk unless specified otherwise. For some reason no choices of none, half and half, or milk have been coming correctly. It's either a super dark coffee that did get some dairy, or a basically black iced coffee with no flavor.

It used to come the typical iced coffee with cream color all the time, but I tried to place the order 3 times today with different selections and each one was completely wrong.

I have a great deal of stress and anxiety but overall I'm happy. I was on Prozac for anxiety but I've been off it for around a year. 

Could my lab results be due to drinking wine or caffeine? Should I follow up with a physician? I was thinking maybe they are just a little off but nothing to worry about because the doctor probably would have called me if it was concerning but wanted to get a professional opinion if possible.

I‚Äôm a 38-year-old product designer (apps/websites) hoping to expand my circle with some authentic, grounded friendships in this amazing city. After living in 3 countries, I‚Äôve learned that the best connections happen when you‚Äôre genuinely yourself ‚Äì so here‚Äôs the real me:

What gets me excited: 

‚úÖ Art galleries, design museums, concerts, and basically anything visually creative

‚úÖ Hunting down the various cultural cuisines across the five boroughs

‚úÖ Those epic long walks where you start in one neighborhood and somehow end up three subway stops away

‚úÖ Gaming sessions (currently obsessed with Helldivers, Alters, or Tekken 8 on PS5

‚úÖ Wellness adventures and the occasional psychedelic journey for growth

‚úÖTennis courts! (Fair warning: I was a fencer in college, so my racket skills are‚Ä¶ a work in progress üòÖ)

What I value: Kindness and honesty are genuinely the most attractive qualities to me. I‚Äôm big on therapy and mental health ‚Äì taking care of ourselves so we can show up better for each other, you know?

What I‚Äôm looking for: Solid platonic friendships with fellow gay guys who are grounded and real. Not seeking romance, but totally open to connections that are platonic or sexual ‚Äì just being upfront about where my head‚Äôs at!

If you‚Äôre someone who loves exploring this city, appreciates good design, enjoys deep conversations over great food, or just wants a walking buddy who won‚Äôt judge your neighborhood detours ‚Äì let‚Äôs grab coffee or wander around somewhere cool!

Drop me a message if this resonates! Always down to discover a new spot or revisit an old favorite. Let‚Äôs navigate the city and create our tribe.‚ú®

**INT. DRAKE‚ÄôS ROOM - EVENING**



*Drake's in his room playing his ""Zbox 720"". His dad comes in without knocking.*



**DRAKE‚ÄôS DAD**

Hey, what's up, Drakester!



**DRAKE**

Agh, Dad! I was about to defeat Undershadow, Lord of Darkness!



**DRAKE‚ÄôS DAD**

Put down the blasphemy and listen up for a quick sec, sport. Me and your mother are having a second honeymoon over the weekend and you're man of the house. This is a big responsibility, so no guests! An- you're not even listening, are you?



**DRAKE**

Yeah yeah, love and marriage, horse and carriage, big probability.



**DRAKE‚ÄôS DAD**

You probably don't even care that there's a ""DeGreggio's"" pizza in the freezer when you get hungry later.



*Drake dies in his game a second time and the sprigs of hair at the crown of his head spike up in excitement as he whips his head around to face his dad in disbelief.*



**DRAKE**

""DeGreggio's"" signature cheesy, carb-heavy goodness!?""



**DRAKE‚ÄôS DAD**

We'll be home Sunday evening. Bye, son!



**GAME VOICE (O.S.)**

Switch to easy mode?



---



**INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER**



*POV shot from inside the oven of Drake haphazardly slapping the frozen pizza into the oven. He gets the bright idea of, instead of waiting for 45 minutes for the oven to cook at 350¬∞, setting it to 1050¬∞ and checking on it 15 minutes later.*



*Drake was certain he'd make quick work of the Lord of Darkness before his pizza was ready.*



---



**INT. DRAKE‚ÄôS ROOM - 36 HOURS LATER**



*36 unfruitful hours and 8000 deaths later, Drake's nose begins to itch.*



**DRAKE**

What's that smell?



*After a brief pause he goes -*



**DRAKE**

AAAAAAAAAAA!



---



**INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS**



*Drake rushes to the kitchen to find out the oven is open and empty. Drake raises a brow and scratches his head. He then hears loud, booming footsteps from outside that shake the scene like an earthquake.*



*A potted plant is knocked off an end table but Drake dives and catches it. He then steps out to see what all the hullabaloo is about.*



---



**EXT. TOWN - CONTINUOUS**



*All types of screaming and a ""RUN FOR YOUR LIFE!"" immediately pierce Drake's eardrums. As Drake is walking into town, a man grabs him by the shoulders and gets in his face.*



**MAN**

Kid, you gotta get outta here!



*He runs off, arms flailing.*



**DRAKE**

What is going on?



*He stops to look into a window with a television showing the local news.*



**TV REPORTER**

This is what's going on! Reporting live in the central square of Maplemooseington, our town has become the playpen of a ginormous, CHEESY-



*Drake jumps as the entire storefront is crushed under the gooey foot of a flaming pizza colossus! Drake has miraculously eluded its ""vision"" and he dips into an alleyway and smacks right into his friend, Cole.*



**DRAKE & COLE**

DRAKE! / COLE!



**DRAKE**

No time to talk, let's get out of here before it hears us!



**COLE**

Unlikely. According to my calculations, cheese cannot grow ears.



*Drake facepalms.*



**COLE**

Great, now it got away. I was going to stick this thermometer in it to find out its temperature. I have a plan and it's gonna get me that humanitarian award for my college application!



**DRAKE**

Uh, how about a Saving-Our-Lives-a-quarius plaque instead?



**COLE**

We'll split the difference and skip step 1. Follow me!



*Cole unfolds two collapsible credit card-sized electric scooters from his minimalist wallet and they take off.*



---



**EXT. CITY STREET - MOVING**



**DRAKE**

Where are we going??



**COLE**

Maplemooseington's coldest water ports are towards the coast. We wait for the anomaly to come plodding down Main St. and we blast it with water from a fire hydrant until it is neutralized.



**DRAKE**

The Anomaly, eh? I'm calling it Cheese Boss!



**COLE**

Whatever. I'm gonna get this thing loose. I've already given it an ocular scan and detected weak points in the metal.



*Cole struggles to move the cap even slightly.*



**COLE**

I think I forgot to carry the 2.



**DRAKE**

Stand back, I know Kung Fu.



*He attempts to drop kick the hydrant and overshoots it, landing over the top of it on his back.*



**DRAKE**

Ow!



**VOICE (O.S.)**

Looks like we all skipped gym class. Difference is, I have something to show for it.



**DRAKE & COLE**

21!



**DRAKE**

Dazzle us with one of your weirdo magic tricks and make Cheese Boss disappear, it's getting close!!



**21**

I deal in dark arts, not magic tricks. And only an elder practitioner can stop something that big. Meh, I'm not even freaking out over it. I'm ready for my transition to the underworld. But first, let me give you mere humans a hand.



*21's dagger-shaped forehead emblem glows as he closes his eyes. He crushes an orb of light in his hand and eats it, then vomits a white-hot luminaire at the fire extinguisher and Drake and Cole duck for cover.*



*The light ricochets off the extinguisher and hits a family of birds living in a treehouse, causing them to explode like dynamite. 21 is puzzled. Some debris from the explosion lands at his feet - a tiny coffee table, a tiny garage door, and a tiny grill. Then a second later, a tiny Bible which 21 picks up in between his index and thumb with a discarded napkin.*



**21**

Huh, that explains it.



**COLE**

We're gonna die! We're gonna die and I haven't even submitted my entry for the citywide robotics comp!



*As Cheese Boss creeps closer to the three, the entire area is enveloped in a vortex of wind, and the giant pile of mozzarella stops dead in its tracks. It is reeled back by what appears to be the force of a black hole, and it screams and vomits UFO-sized pepperonis and olives and sausage bits that look like wrecking balls.*



*With a horrifyingly huge gaping maw emerging from behind it that then swallowed the entire thing whole without effort, this leviathan found out that there's always a bigger fish. And this fish was having its fourth cheat day of the week.*



**DRAKE / COLE / 21**

RED!!



*The three welcome their pretty, red-haired friend.*



**COLE**

You really bailed us out there!



*Red couldn't speak.*



**21**

I had a feeling in my spirit that it was my time today. Eh.



**DRAKE**

Before you got here, Cheese Boss was destroying everything.



**COLE**

Yeah, except your gastrointestinal tract.



**DRAKE**

Awe man, and I was really looking forward to- WAIT, you guys knew this was all my fault...?



**21**

It's your fault at least twice a month at this point.



*(Flashback to the four of them attempting to slurp their way out of a chocolate milkshake ocean with straws.)*



**COLE**

My blood sugar never recovered.



*Drake's ""Alien Alex"" novelty watch starts beeping.*



**DRAKE**

Oh, crud! My parents are gonna be home in 15 minutes! I'm so grounded...



**COLE**

Yeah, and the top speed of that abandoned ice cream truck across the street is only about 30 mph, according to the optical gauge I just ran. You're screwed, dude.



*A dejected Drake and his friends are strong-armed into the back of the truck by Red, who still has not uttered a single word.*



**21**

What the...?



*Red stood at the back of the ice cream truck, facing out and holding on for dear life.*



**DRAKE**

Hey Cole, what's the statistical likelihood of Red going 5 seconds without talking?



**COLE**

Beats MeeeeeAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!



*Red begins belching with the unrelenting force of a jet engine, propelling the ice cream truck through the streets of Maplemooseington at mach speed! Drake and Cole are fighting over the steering wheel and 21 is sitting by the deep freezer in the back with headphones on, listening to who knows what.*



**DRAKE**

Cole, only one of us has seen ""Pedal 2 the Metal: Japan"" 10 times!



**COLE**

And I





wrote a 50 page essay on the theory of nonsensicality, which is what you are proving right now!



*The ice cream truck careens onto Drake's street, with Red still delivering an unadulterated supply of eructation horsepower. Drake sees the family station wagon in his driveway and frets.*



**DRAKE**

We're too late...



*Cole quickly counts on his fingers and kicks Drake out with precise enough timing for him to be able to fly out of the side of the van and through his bedroom window.*



**DRAKE**

AAAAAAAAAAAA-OOOF!



---



**INT. DRAKE‚ÄôS ROOM - MOMENTS LATER**



*He lands smack dab in the middle of his bed. Drake's dad pokes his head in and knocks on the already open door.*



**DRAKE‚ÄôS DAD**

There he is. What's up, kiddo?



*Drake lay spread eagle over his sheets and doesn't say a word.*



**DRAKE‚ÄôS DAD**

Heh, out cold. That's a ""DeGreggio's"" nap right there.

This year they asked if I could repaint downstairs and I said no problem, just make sure everything is off the walls and ready so we can come in and paint. Got there today and they made an effort to move stuff but the bigger issue is the state of how they've left the walls/skirting boards etc. As in, I don't think they have EVER cleaned them or cleaned up spills, there's crayon and marker all up the walls (which they covered up with furniture) and it looks - best way to describe it is like they've ran around the house with coffee and wherever it splattered they just left it rather than wiping it up. So I've spent the day scrubbing baseboards and crayon before we can even start to paint.

Now I know kids are messy, normal wear and tear, etc and we are going to do our best to sort everything before they get back regardless, but I was thinking about mentioning to them that in future, if they clean up after themselves on a more regular basis, it will stay nicer looking for longer. Is this an unreasonable thing to mention? It's just they do not seem to have any concept of regular cleaning. For example, they have in the past asked me to look at the 'mould' in the bathroom, which just needed wiping off with some cleaner but they clearly had never done it. Or when they asked me to unclog the drain and I found they'd been tipping pasta and food into it like it was a bin...

However, I'm struggling a bit with the best way of executing on it. I really want my company to have monopoly powers in foreign countries (I know I could probably achieve most of the same effect with just foreign investment rights, but let's say I want monopoly powers to rp). The problems are:

1. No one will agree to give my company a monopoly (This is good)

2. I don't see a way to pressure a country into giving my company a monopoly other than diplomatic plays/war (This is fine)

3. I can't find a way to initiate a diplomatic play around monopoly treaty enforcement. (This is quite bad). I have to demand something else from them and then piggyback the monopoly on top of the separate demand. And if the other demand is too small (e.g. foreign investment rights into a country much weaker than me) then they'll agree to the demand and never start a diplomatic play, so I never have the chance to add the monopoly demand.

So if I want foreign monopolies, I need to start constant foreign diplomatic plays/wars about \*other\* things, and then try to add the monopoly demand. Am I seeing things wrong?

Just back from a week in Boston, Newport, Mystic and Maine. Maine was my fiftieth state to visit so that was the reason for the trip. It was me (58F) and my daughter (21F) who went on the trip. 

It was a bit of a ‚Äútaste‚Äù of things as we only had a week and had a friend to visit in Worcester. Could have spent the entire time in Maine/Bar Harbor. But we didn‚Äôt feel rushed and really enjoyed everything. 

Thanks for all the trip reports and tips on this sub that helped me plan it all!

We went to Boston, Newport, Mystic, Boothbay Harbor and Bar Harbor/Acadia but I‚Äôll limit this to the Bar Harbor/Acadia part. 

We only had two and a half days in 
Bar Harbor/Acadia but that is enough time to see a lot. 

Got to Bar Harbor late in afternoon. Checked into Queen Anne‚Äôs Revenge Inn which was lovely. Spotless room and nice breakfast and porch seating. They have a bar area and some shuffleboard courts being used by families. In quiet street with easy walk into town (it is in town). Plenty of parking for all guests. Walked into town from hotel for dinner at Rosalie‚Äôs Pizza (had been in NE and Maine for almost a week so wanted a change from seafood. Was delicious). Lovely little town. Busy but not overrun even with it being week of July 4. 

Got up early the next day (left hotel at 7:15 - so not early by some people‚Äôs standards!) to park at Sand Beach and do Great Head Trail. We had to do two circles of the parking lot before a spot opened up. People were pretty consistently coming and going. We spent some time on the beach enjoying the sound of the waves and the relative serenity as it was pretty empty. Then we headed to the trailhead at the far end of the beach. This trail is rated as ‚Äúeasy‚Äù in our National Geographic Acadia trail pamphlet but it is quite a steep trail with lots of granite scrambling. You can see in the photo the granite with the blue paint indicating the trail. All Trails rates it moderate and I would agree with that. It has amazing views and we were lucky it was clear. We just did the short loop as my knees didn‚Äôt want to go on the far loop. My daughter would have easily done that. We came back to the beach and enjoyed it again. By then (probably around 9:30 am) lots of families had set up on the beach. 

Then we did some of the Ocean Path as car was parked. We heard Thunder Hole - totally sounds like thunder! - and then drove to Otter Point and walked on the Ocean Path trail there. Plenty of parking there around 10 am. 

Had Cadillac Mountain pass at 11. Drove up to summit and it was clear and beautiful! Got a drink and whoopie pie from the store at the summit. Wandered around on the vast smooth granite area and it wasn‚Äôt nearly as crowded as I expected as there is so much space. Parking lot and spots along the road were all full but people come and go so no issues getting a spot. 

No bugs! And we saw the sand bar trail to Bar Island go from sand bar to ocean which was fun. 

We drove back down and stopped at some of the overlooks which are all on the right side going back down. Then we drove to Jordan Pond to walk the loop in the afternoon. We had to do three loops to get parking - definitely the busiest time around 1 pm. 

At Jordan Pond we walked to the pond and saw the restaurant to the ‚Äúleft‚Äù. We went that way around the pond (so clockwise) and the first half going that way has lots of boardwalk where you have to step off or onto the extra boardwalk built to let others pass every now and then. There is a bit of rock scramble towards the top of the lake but nothing very challenging if you are reasonable fit and mobile. After the very top the rest of the way back to the car is very level. There are some breaks in the path to allow little streams to come into the pond where you have to walk over spaces in the trail. Again, very easy and we saw little kids and older people managing it easily. Also strollers. If somewhat narrow boardwalks and rock scrambles aren‚Äôt possible for you, going up to the top anti-clockwise would be the right choice. When we got back to the parking lot around 3:30 there were plenty of spots available. And some cars that had parked along the little road between the two parking areas had tickets. 

Came back to town and ate at the Reading Room at the Bar Harbor Inn - table by the window. We had made reservations several weeks before. Food and service wonderful. Saw sunset and schooner coming back to harbor. Such a picturesque spot with lots of historical photos. We walked around the harbor then back to hotel. 

The next day we left the car at the hotel and did the sand bar trail to Bar Island at low tide which was at 10:00 am. Lots of families and such a fun thing to do. We were lucky low tide corresponded well to our itinerary. We walked on to the Island and to the far end but the fog had come in so we couldn‚Äôt see Bar Harbor. But it didn‚Äôt matter. Then we went back into town for lunch at Paddy‚Äôs Irish Pub at the corner of Main Street and West. Ate at an outdoor table and food was fine - not spectacular but typical for an Irish pub. Seating and views were great. 

We left town and made our way to Bass Point Lighthouse. On the way we did the Flying Mountain and Valley Park Trail which is really one loop. The Flying Mountain Trail is another granite scramble marked as easy in our guide but which is moderate in my book and on All Trails. Really fun and great views ending at the water. The Valley Peak Trail coming back to the parking lot is a gravel road so very easy for pets and kids and older folks. We had to wait about 15 minutes for a parking spot at Bass Head lighthouse. But it was worth the wait to see the lighthouse and walk out in the rocks at the far end of the parking lot. Then it was back to Portland to fly out the next day. 

Highlights: For me, it was Monhegan Island (we took ferry from Boothbay Harbor) so not even anything in Acadia. If an artist colony with trails and old Maine houses and a boat ride are your thing check it out. See photos if interested. For my daughter it was literally everything in Acadia. The rugged coastline and hiking were just what she loves!

Things we learned: 

1. Things are close together in New England! We are from the Midwest and can drive for 10 hours and not get out of our state. Boston to Newport to Mystic to Maine did not take long. 

2. Flexibility - much easier with 2 people and the child being 21 than when kids were little. We changed our Monhegan Island trip a day due to forecast of heavy rain. That took the extra afternoon we would have had in Acadia but it was worth it. Not having many fixed dinner plans allowed us to do what we wanted in the day. We never had an issue getting dinner in a nice place without a long wait. But we weren‚Äôt picky about where we went at all! We had our car in Acadia due to our Cadillac Mountain pass. Parking spots were very full. But by mid afternoon there were lots of spots everywhere we drove by. If I go again I will plan some hikes later in the day due to parking. Or I‚Äôll take the Island Explorer. 

3. Trail ratings are somewhat subjective. Our National Geographic pamphlet of Acadia listed the Great Head trail and Flying Mountain Trail as ‚Äúeasy‚Äù. Both have a lot of granite scrambles and exposed roots with very little level trail. I have a bad knee and back - both of which weren‚Äôt flaring up on the trip so I could manage it, but it was definitely not easy. All Trails list them at moderate. I am so glad we did it but caution people who may have mobility or fitness issues to know that one persons easy/moderate may not be their own. The Ocean Path and carriage trails are great alternatives for mostly level, unobstructed trails. 

4. Eating - with our somewhat packed schedule we didn‚Äôt make many reservations. We decided to mostly wing it which was easy with just me and my adult daughter. We were there for the hiking and views rather than the food so that was fine with us. There are lots of coffee shops and restaurants and it was a busy week so I don‚Äôt think it would be an issue ever to get dinner or lunch without a long wait. 

5. Weather - we had hot, cold, sun, fog, rain. We had good raincoats, sun hats, keen sandals and hiking shoes. I thought I may have packed too much but was glad to have the right clothes for the situations. 

6. People - in Bar Harbor/Acadia without exception very friendly and helpful. I consider myself a polite and patient tourist and anticipated some frustration just due to crowds. We know we were in very popular places the week before and of July 4 and being patient and kind helps everyone. A few fellow tourists acted like they owned the sidewalks or were super loud in restaurants but most were also patient and flexible. I had read about the ‚Äúfrom away‚Äù attitude some Mainers have about the tourists and understand it as we live in a tourist town. Other than an exceedingly rude shop owner in Boothbay Harbor everyone was kind and welcoming. 

We came home with great memories and fondness for the whole area. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll go back in the future and spend more time and find more great places to enjoy. Happy to answer questions if you have any.

1lsc607,https://www.reddit.com/r/LordofTheMysteriesRP/comments/1lsc607/the_fate_of_heretics_monk_subjugation_mission/,The fate of heretics - monk subjugation mission,"The sky exhibited a stunning shade of blue with velvety clouds. Only a few minutes ago, we were all relaxing, enjoying our Saturday afternoon at the

prestigious albeit dangerous Caf√© of the End. The smell of freshly ground coffee was permeating the air, and the soft jazz was creating an all-around lovely

atmosphere.

Then the owner proudly entered the caf√© with a piece of paper in his hand, which was a new bounty.

Some people immediately jumped out of their seats to see what the bounty was, a common sight to see, but something strange was happening: all of them returned to their seats with a defeated look in their eyes.

This was unusual for several reasons. Plenty of the people there were mercenaries, living only on bounty rewards, so for them to refuse the work meant only one thing: the difficulty of this mission was extraordinary.

All of them, except for this one fellow who seemed a bit off at first glance. His name was Poetic; he wore a tailcoat with multiple pockets, had an average build, and his hair was quite disheveled. However, his most striking features were his extremely sharp eyes and his unnaturally pale skin.

Compared to everyone else, he didn‚Äôt go back to his drinks or meal; instead, he went around the caf√© and recruited a few peculiar people.

The first person he recruited was a brazen-looking man called Rafex, a tall, towering figure, light-eyed with brown-red hair and a mischievous smile on his face.

The second was a priest named Arthur, he was a bit short, he had his clergy robe on, had striking blue eyes hidden behind an expensive pair of glasses, and combed hair. He also seemed to be quite tipsy for such an early hour.

And finally, the third was one of the workers; he looked rugged, with messy hair that was clearly tied up in a bun due to the rules of his workplace, and not by will. He had a short beard, compared to the other 3; he refused his name, simply asking to be called by a nickname, Door.

To all of them, Poetic said the same thing:‚Äù I know you want to take on that mission, so let's form a team and do it together‚Äù.

This kind of straightforward approach usually wouldn‚Äôt work so easily, but Poetic instinctively knew what their motivation was.

Rafex was looking for work in general, so he was eager to join the moment he heard someone else was interested, but the other 2 weren't so straightforward.

Arthur simply wanted to bring these criminals to justice, although he wouldn‚Äôt mind the rewards either.

¬†Door, on the other hand, simply wanted more experience and to advance in this new twisted world he found himself in.

As for Poetic himself, he simply knew he should do it.

So they all teamed up, both intrigued by Poetic‚Äôs uncanny instincts and for their own interest.

They all gathered and were brought into one of the private rooms of the caf√©. The room was dimly lit, with no natural light seeping in and with reinforced walls so no sound could get out; the only source of light was a candle sitting tall in the center of the wooden table.

Before everyone could pull a seat, the eager Rafex immediately broke the silence and asked:

‚Äú So what‚Äôs our plan?‚Äù

‚Äú I can try to use divination, but first let's go over the basic details‚Äù, Door said.

‚ÄúWhat we know for sure is that these heretic monks have strayed from their beliefs and desecrated the sacred temple of their god, and currently hide in it-‚Äú, Arthur added.

‚ÄúThe temple should be around the ocean, it was made in honor of one of the lord's angels and is atop a cliff overlooking a nearby village‚Äù- Poetic completed.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs enough information, let's first check if they are still there‚Äù, Door said before bringing out the crystal ball in his pouch.

‚ÄúDo you always walk around carrying balls?‚Äù Rafex mockingly asked

‚ÄúYes, I also carry a few weapons, wanna see what they can do?‚Äù Door quickly replied

‚ÄúENOUGH, we have heretics to punish, we don‚Äôt have time for your bickering‚Äù, Arthur exclaimed

‚ÄúFine, fine,‚Äù both of them said in unison.

With his focus returned to the crystal ball in front of him, Door‚Äôs eyes turned black as night before tiny dots started sparkling in his eyes, turning them into

a deep shade of blue, resembling the night sky, before repeating a statement 7 times: ‚Äúthe location of the monks who desecrated the temple of storms‚Äù.

Then the crystal ball showed a vision, first it was of a dilapidated temple atop a hill, surrounded by a small village. 4 cloaked figures were sitting around an altar made of bone and flesh. The room they were in was dimly lit, with the natural light barely getting through the blood-covered mosaics that once depicted the angel of storms.

‚Äú THESE BASTARDS‚Äù, Arthur shouted.

‚ÄúYes, yes, we don‚Äôt have time for your little faith crisis priest, we have other things to do‚Äù, Rafex mocked.

‚ÄúHe is right, if we want to stop them, we have to stop fighting‚Äù, Poetic added.

‚ÄúSilence, I'm not done with my divination‚Äù, Door exclaimed.

‚ÄúI'm sorry‚Äù, said Arthur.

‚ÄúLet's see if we can find out their pathways, too‚Äù, Door said before he pulled out a tarot deck. He shuffled the cards around and pulled out two tarot cards.

One is Death, and the other is The Hierophant, ‚Äúsailor and corpse collector pathways. I can‚Äôt tell the sequence.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow do we know your divination is correct?‚Äù both Rafex and Arthur asked.

‚ÄúIt might not be, I don‚Äôt know for certain myself, this is the first time I'm doing this‚Äù, Door replied.

‚ÄúNo, it's correct, I can feel it‚Äù, Poetic added.

‚ÄúWorks for me‚Äù, Door said before he pulled out 2 more cards.

‚ÄúDeath and a Knight of wands, huh? Not a good sign.‚Äù This means our battle will be fierce and dangerous.

‚ÄúThat is all that I can decipher with divination‚Äù, Door concluded.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs enough to start with,‚Äù Poetic says, ‚Äújust trust me once we get there.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure. It‚Äôs annoying, but last time it worked,‚Äù mentions Rafex. ‚ÄúSo does anyone know how we can get there?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat are you‚Ä¶ doesn‚Äôt matter, how do we get to the temple?‚Äù Door asked.

‚ÄúWe can just ask around. Surely people have heard about this temple before‚Äù, Arthur suggests.

‚ÄúSounds like a decent plan‚Äù, says Rafex.

The four of us leave the bar and each goes their way to find information. An hour later, we all met up again in the bar.

‚ÄúI only found that there haven‚Äôt been communications with the temple lately,‚Äù Rafex starts, ‚Äúnone of the monks left, and no one who has entered left‚Äù.

‚ÄúThat matches what I found,‚Äù Arthur confirms.

‚ÄúI found an old man who told me exactly where we need to go, I even marked it on my map‚Äù, Poetic shares.

The rest of the members all marvel at his luck.

‚ÄúWelp, that‚Äôs quite lucky!‚Äù Door says

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs leave as soon as possible, the last thing I want is to let these blasphemers finish their rituals‚Äù, Athur angrily exclaimed.

After a short preparation, everyone packs their gear, the group leaves, and makes its way to the surrounding area of the temple.

After multiple carriage rides, they finally get there.

They tip the carriage driver at Door‚Äôs dismay and jump out of the carriage.

The carriage barely departed before Arthur exclaimed, ‚ÄúGet ready to fight at any moment, there are undead in there‚Äù.

‚ÄúSo he is not a weak corpse collector, huh?‚Äù Rafex asked half mockingly.

‚ÄúYes‚Äù, Arthur responded seriously.

‚ÄúI say we get more information first,‚Äù Rafex says and points to a small hill nearby. ‚ÄúWe can go there and get a look inside‚Äù.

After a short hike, the group finally gets to the hill. The sight that greets them is that of a large temple surrounded by a small village.

The entire temple seems wrong. It's in a dilapidated state, some of the roofs have caved inside, except for the main praying room, while the mosaics have a blackish red look to them.

‚ÄúJust like in my divination,‚Äù Door exclaimed.

‚ÄúLet's explore this place for a bit,‚Äù Poetic suggested.

Around the temple, dozens of houses lay abandoned, some belonging to the priests who used to live here, while others still have broken swings and toys lying around, and in other homes, you can find bowls with rotten food inside.

‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt even fight back‚Äù, Rafex exclaimed, clearly taken aback by the tragedy that occurred to them.

‚ÄúHow can you fight against 4 beyonders when you are just a human? Even if they outnumbered them, they never stood a chance‚Äù. Door added.

‚ÄúIt was a slaughter, I knew from the vision that they had desecrated the temple, but I prayed, no, I hoped that they were animal remains, not humans.‚Äù Poetic sighed.

‚ÄúThey even killed the kids, no one was spared‚Äù, Arthur added while clenching his fist.

That‚Äôs when they see four people. Three of them are in monks' clothes; they don‚Äôt look entirely human, their faces are sunken, and they seem sick. The fourth man stands before the three monks; he has very pale skin and looks like a moving corpse.

‚ÄúDuck!‚Äù Rafex says in a hastened whisper as he pulls them all down. At that moment, the gaze of the pale man turns towards the hill, but he doesn‚Äôt notice anything.

""It seems we're lucky."" Door muttered while lying low.

The outside sky portrays an ominous shade of grey.

Arriving at the former gathering place of the monks, the group doesn‚Äôt have to look long for the suspects. They‚Äôre right there. Arthur clutches his fist and says with a whisper, ‚ÄúUndead.‚Äù

We all immediately go on guard. The Monks are seen in prostration to one of them. Poetic gets a premonition. Door gets a premonition. Poetic nods, and Door stays back and takes out his pistol.

‚ÄúFollow our lead!‚Äù Poetic says to Rafex and Arthur. Rafex, knowing Poetic‚Äôs style, follows through. Arthur is shocked at first, but decides to follow along too.

Poetic takes out his Hammer and points at the Spirit Guide. ‚ÄúEXILE!‚Äù He gets flung out of the circle. He rages and tries to come back in, but can‚Äôt. Immediately, Poetic turns to one of the Monks and strikes him with the hammer. He reveals some illusory scales on his skin.

‚ÄúSailors!‚Äù Rafex immediately realizes. He promptly stops and rethinks his plan.

Arthur doesn‚Äôt hesitate and immediately shouts, ‚ÄúCleanse!‚Äù.

A holy, resplendent light falls upon one of the Folk of Rage. His body singes, and after the light fades, the only thing left is a charred body.

The Spirit Guide Rampager bangs on the illusory barrier preventing its entry. It lets out a blood-curdling cry. These Monks are possessed by Spirits!!

The other two Monks turn. The Seafarer rushes to Poetic.

BANG!

Headshot. Door shoots him. Poetic turn around and use the Robot body control to strike him with the Hammer again. Luckily, this sends him tumbling to Rafex.

They lock in a brawl of fists. ‚ÄúC‚Äômon, fish face! You fight like a girl!‚Äù

Arthur then turns his attention to the other Folk of Rage. He tries to jump back. Luckily for us, he trips despite the Sailor‚Äôs balance. A holy light drowns him.

Poetic then signals to Rafex to throw the Seafarer to him. As he does, Door shoots at him again. The bullet bounces off the scales.

The Seafarer looks to Poetic and trips on the casing of the bullet. What luck! He trips and then looks up again. Before he can stand, a holy beam eviscerates the spirit, and the charred body falls to the ground.

The Rampager‚Äôs eyes are bloodshot. Poetic then turns to the Rampager and yells, ‚ÄúCONFINEMENT!‚Äù

The Rampager is trapped. Door begins to run away. The Rampager reaches towards him but is stopped by the walls of Confinement!

Rafex takes the opportunity to get into close combat range. Poetic joins Rafex. Rafex throws fire punches. Poetic strikes with his hammer. Arthur prepares a large holy beam and begins chanting, ‚ÄúBlessed of the Sun. Brightest of stars. Light which cleans‚Äî‚Äù

Poetic stays in close combat range while Rafex jumps back. The Spirit Guide takes hit after hit. Poetic dodges with a mix of body control and premonition.

He then hits him so that the Rampager hits a wall. Poetic rushes in. The Spirit Guide gains semblance and grabs Poetic.

Rafex, stepping back, now uses his shadow limbs to draw his bow back and lets out a yawn. He quickly lights his fingers on fire, the sting of the heat keeping him awake.

The Spirit Guide is about to use the language of the dead to expel Poetic‚Äôs spirit. Poetic smirks.

\*Click. BANG!\*

A hit to the back of the head of the Rampager. The bullet caused him to fumble the language of the dead. Door had shot him through the wall. Point blank.

The Rampager throws Poetic to the back. Luckily, he lands on his feet and regains his balance. A minute has almost passed.

He points the Hammer. ‚ÄúFLOG!‚Äù. The Rampager is hit by many illusory whips. Rafex hears the cue, and the bow drawn by the Shadow Limbs is released.

He imbues it with the flame held in his hand. The flaming arrow shot by the powerful draw of the Shadow Limbs pierces the Rampager.

\*BOOM\*

A burst of flame caused by a trick from Door. The flame dies down. The Rampager is burnt. Poetic walks closer to investigate. Suddenly, he hears a murmur.

Language of the dead!!

As the last word is about to be spoken, a fly enters the Rampager‚Äôs mouth, and he is again unable to complete his command. The Rampager makes another desperate attempt to bind to a spirit.

A holy and bright light, resplendent and emanating glory and purity, falls upon him.

Arthur had finished his chant. Holy light had cleansed the heretic. The Rampager falls.

The mission had come to a triumphant end. All four beyonders made their way back to the Caf√® of the End.

""I am exhausted, my spirituality appears to be drained,"" Arthur says to the others.

""In that case, let's swiftly get over with our rewards,"" Rafex replies.

""Sure, but first I have got to order some drinks,"" Arthur adds on.

The three beyonders sitting at the table were astonished.

""You drink ?"" Door asks.

""Obviously, I'd like to remind you that I am not a real priest. I was an ordinary alchemist before I became a beyonder. Alcohol is one of my most beloved pleasures in life."" Arthur replies.

One could tell Rafex was much nonchalant regarding this fact, but both Door and Poetic felt quite bizarre, having their true emotions show up on their face.

""You can judge me all you want, I don't mind it,"" Arthur says with a rather pure face.

Meanwhile, they had our rewards given out. After a few minutes of discussion and arguments, along with a couple of provocations from Rafex and people glaring at us, we had our rewards distributed.

""Well then, I guess this is where we depart. I'll be going to the casino if anyone needs me. I have an intuition that I'll win big today."" Poetic says as he bids them all farewell and goes on towards the casino.

"" I'll be heading home then. The usage of those limbs is really tiring."" Rafex said as he left with a mischievous smile.

""It seems I am the only ordinary person among us in terms of mental well-being."" Door comments as he departs from the caf√®.

Arthur sits there enjoying his beloved drinks, looking into the once again alluring blue sky.

WHAT IS GOOD TROUBLE? (AND WHY YOU SHOULD START MAKIN‚Äô SOME)

Alright you beautiful dairy-fueled legends, it‚Äôs time we have a little chat about Good Trouble, and I ain‚Äôt talkin‚Äô about gettin‚Äô grounded for cow tipping or flipping off a stoplight camera in Green Bay. I‚Äôm talkin‚Äô about righteous, revolutionary, raise-some-hell kind of trouble. The kind your grandkids will read about in a history book if we do it right.

Because lemme tell ya, silence is the midwestern disease. We‚Äôre taught to keep our heads down, shovel the driveway, and never make a fuss...unless someone puts ketchup on a bratwurst. Then it‚Äôs war. But injustice? ‚ÄúOh well, what can ya do?‚Äù

NOPE. Not today, Karen.

GOOD TROUBLE is when you:

Chain yourself to a bulldozer to stop ‚Äòem from clearcutting sacred land for another billionaire pipeline.

Sit your butt in a Capitol hallway with a sign that says ‚ÄúHealthcare is a human right‚Äù until the cops drag you out.

Yell so loud at a city council meeting that even the mayor‚Äôs hairpiece does a backflip.

Help shut down ICE raids by forming a neighborhood shield wall with your aunties and uncles.

GOOD TROUBLE is John Lewis crossing the bridge.

It‚Äôs Fred Hampton feeding kids before the state shot him in his bed.
It‚Äôs Indigenous water protectors putting their bodies on the line because corporations treat the Earth like a trash can.

And guess what?

It‚Äôs also YOU refusing to play nice while the powerful play dirty. It‚Äôs you turnin‚Äô your nice little midwestern manners into molotov cocktails of truth.

Because listen, we‚Äôre not here to make fascism feel cozy. We‚Äôre not here to sit politely while the rich strip our land, cage our people, and sell us back our own water at $3.99 a bottle. Hell no.

We are here to organize, disrupt, resist, and rebuild, from the Kwik Trip parking lot to the Capitol rotunda.

Examples?

üß† You print off zines at the library and drop them in every Casey‚Äôs gas station bathroom across three counties.

üöó You carpool 40 minutes with your cousin Mike to a protest because someone‚Äôs gotta hold the banner.

üßØYou interrupt a fake ‚Äúcommunity listening session‚Äù with an airhorn and a copy of the Constitution.

ü•î You hand out baked potatoes at a homeless encampment while city officials pretend housing isn‚Äôt a human right.

üì£ You yell ‚ÄúThis Land is Our Land‚Äù with your whole chest until the DNR hears it all the way up in the UP.

GOOD TROUBLE IS HOLY WORK.

It‚Äôs gospel in steel-toed boots.
It‚Äôs love with a backbone.
It‚Äôs Midwest grit with a bullhorn, baby.

So go out there.
Raise your voice.
Lock arms.
Break rules if they break people.
Disobey when obedience equals oppression.
And when they tell you to sit down, you look ‚Äòem straight in the eyes and say:

‚ÄúI‚Äôm from Wisconsin. We invented standing up.‚Äù

Now grab your coffee, lace up your boots, and raise some beautiful, radical, necessary, GOOD TROUBLE.

And remember...
If you‚Äôre not on a watchlist yet, are you even tryin‚Äô?

KEEP. ER. RADICAL.

1lsc4av,https://i.redd.it/tt2857snn2bf1.png,Matcha Green Tea Latte Nutrition: A Delicious Dive,"So I've been *obsessed* with matcha lattes lately, and after diving deep into the **Matcha Green Tea Latte Nutrition: A Delicious Dive**, I had to share what I learned because honestly? I wish someone had told me this stuff months ago.

I started making these at home after getting tired of spending $6+ on coffee shop versions that were basically sugar bombs with a hint of matcha. Don't get me wrong ‚Äì I love a good treat, but when I discovered that a Grande matcha latte from certain chains packs 240 calories and 32 grams of sugar, I was like... *wait, what?*

üëâ *Ready to transform your morning routine with a healthier, more energizing alternative to your usual coffee? Let's dive into why matcha might just become your new best friend.*

**Why Quality Matcha Actually Matters**

Here's the thing I didn't expect: not all matcha is created equal. The bright green powder you see at the grocery store for $3? That's probably not going to give you the same benefits as ceremonial grade matcha. When I finally splurged on higher-quality matcha (*yes, it's more expensive upfront*), the difference was night and day.

Real matcha is stone-ground from shade-grown tea leaves, which boosts the chlorophyll and gives it that vibrant color. The shading process also increases the amino acid L-theanine, which is what gives you that calm, focused energy instead of the jittery buzz from coffee. I actually feel more alert but less anxious when I drink a proper matcha latte compared to my old coffee habit.

**The Texture Secret That Changed Everything**

I spent *way* too many mornings dealing with clumpy, bitter matcha disasters before I figured this out. The secret isn't just whisking ‚Äì it's the temperature and the order you add things. Most people dump hot milk directly onto the matcha powder, but that actually scorches it and creates that weird chalky texture nobody wants.

The traditional method involves creating a smooth paste first with just a tiny bit of room-temperature water, then gradually adding your heated milk. It sounds fussy, but it literally takes 30 seconds and the difference is incredible. Your **Matcha Green Tea Latte Nutrition: A Delicious Dive** becomes so much more enjoyable when the texture is silky instead of grainy.

**A Little History That Made Me Appreciate It More**

I had no idea that matcha has been around for almost 900 years. Japanese monks originally used it for meditation because of that unique calm-but-alert feeling it provides. They weren't wrong ‚Äì there's actual science behind why matcha feels different from other caffeinated drinks.

The L-theanine I mentioned earlier works synergistically with caffeine to provide sustained energy without the crash. It's like nature's perfect energy drink, honestly. When I learned this, it made me appreciate my daily **Matcha Green Tea Latte Nutrition: A Delicious Dive** ritual even more.

**My Personal Matcha Journey**

To be honest, I was skeptical at first. I'm not usually the person who jumps on health trends, but my sister kept raving about how matcha helped her afternoon energy crashes. I thought she was being dramatic.

But after about two weeks of replacing my 3 PM coffee with a homemade matcha latte, I noticed I wasn't getting that weird 4 PM slump anymore. My energy felt more stable throughout the day. *Plus* ‚Äì and this might be placebo effect, but I doubt it ‚Äì my skin started looking clearer. Matcha is packed with antioxidants, so maybe there's something to that whole ""beauty from within"" thing.

**The Nutrition Breakdown That Surprised Me**

When I really started researching **Matcha Green Tea Latte Nutrition: A Delicious Dive**, I was shocked by how much nutritional value you get. A homemade version with unsweetened almond milk and just a touch of honey clocks in at around 35 calories versus the 240+ you'd get from most coffee shops.

But it's not just about calories. Matcha contains catechins that help lower blood pressure and LDL cholesterol levels, and it's known to boost metabolism, enhance focus, and provide calm energy without the jitters usually associated with coffee. That metabolism boost alone makes it worth considering if you're trying to maintain or lose weight.

**Making It Work for Real Life**

I'm not going to lie and say I make ceremonial-grade matcha with a bamboo whisk every morning. Some days I just want something quick and easy. I've found that preparing a small batch of matcha paste on Sunday and storing it in the fridge works perfectly for busy weekdays. Just scoop, add milk, heat, and you're done.

The key is finding your sweet spot with sweetness. I started with way too much honey because I was used to sugary coffee drinks. Now I use maybe half a teaspoon of maple syrup, and sometimes I skip sweetener entirely. Your taste buds adjust faster than you'd think.

**Why This Matters Long-Term**

What I love most about switching to matcha is that it feels sustainable. Coffee was making me anxious and giving me crashes, but matcha provides steady energy that lasts for hours. When I'm researching **Matcha Green Tea Latte Nutrition: A Delicious Dive** topics like this, I can actually focus for longer periods without that scattered feeling.

Plus, there's something meditative about the preparation ritual. Even on my rushed mornings, those two minutes of whisking and steaming milk feel like a small act of self-care.

Let‚Äôs call them Anna and Beth. I was best friends with Anna from our teenage years. We were close the kind of close where you imagine they‚Äôll be in your life forever. Beth came in later, but over time the dynamic changed

It used to be me, Anna, and her long-term boyfriend  we were a trio for years. But now, it‚Äôs Anna, her boyfriend, and Beth. And I‚Äôve slowly been pushed out.

They do everything together the gym, coffees, days out, nights in  and I‚Äôm never included. I‚Äôd know because we used a shared calendar app (that i suggested)to see when we were all free. I could literally see plans being made that didn‚Äôt include me. I don‚Äôt think people realise how isolating that can feel when you‚Äôre watching people you love carry on without you.

And the only time I ever heard from Anna lately was when she needed something, a lift, help with the garden, someone to house-sit, a trip to the garbage site to load heavy waste. I gave so much of my time, energy, and kindness. When she moved into her home, I helped paint, gave her furniture and kitchen stuff, gig tickets, helped with carpets all of it. I was always there.

But when I moved into my first proper home, nothing. No offer of help, no ‚Äúhow‚Äôs the house coming along?‚Äù Just silence. That‚Äôs when I really started seeing it for what it was.

I invited them over once after about two months of moving, I rushed around after work, made food, got drinks in, made it cosy for a girls night in, I excited! they showed up with a take-away for themselves and didn‚Äôt even acknowledge the effort I had made. When they left, Anna‚Äôs boyfriend picked them up. I ask Anna if her bf would come in and see the house I was proud, it was a big moment for me. She replied that he‚Äôd rather not. He sat in his car and waited for them. Someone I‚Äôve known for years couldn‚Äôt even get out to say hello. Didn't even acknowledge me

Even Beth now speaks on his behalf sometimes, which is just odd behaviour. It‚Äôs like they‚Äôve become this tight little unit and I was demoted to ""useful background character."" Feels like they're in a relationship together ngl.. its weird 

I used to bring up how left out I felt. I‚Äôd say things like ‚ÄúI feel like I hardly see you both anymore‚Äù  hoping it would open a conversation. It never did. Just awkward silences or a quick change of subject. For Christmas, I suggested we go on a little trip together. They barely responded. They didn‚Äôt want to.

I even told my friend Anna recently that my grandfather was in hospital. Her response? Just one word ‚ÄúWeird.‚Äù It was like there was nothing left of the friendship we once had.

I saw them at a local caf√© one afternoon. Anna played a voice note from her boyfriend on WhatsApp asking if Beth wanted to come for a takeaway. Beth said yes. Plans made in front of me, like I wasn‚Äôt there. Then when I brought up a film I wanted to see, they said they‚Äôd already booked it. Again  without me.

I saw them online together gaming later that day. I‚Äôm always see them online. I‚Äôm never invited. And yes, I could ask‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs not the same when you‚Äôre always the one trying to wedge yourself in. Friendship shouldn‚Äôt feel like an audition.

So I muted them on social media. Left the shared calendar. I‚Äôve said nothing. I don‚Äôt need to. I‚Äôve accepted that this isn‚Äôt friendship anymore, it‚Äôs convenience. I was good for favours, good for chores, good when they needed something. But never wanted 

And do you know what? As much as it hurts, I feel better now!! ‚ú®Ô∏è‚ú®Ô∏è‚ú®Ô∏è

**1. Only rely on Supreme Court issuances, not on chismis.** Do you guys remember the ""AI-checker"" rumor? dumagdag lang 'yon sa stress ng bar takers, hindi naman pala totoo. 

**2. Make a schedule.** Kung may topics ka na strength mo, allot only an hour for it, if may weakness ka, allot more time doon. 

**3. Do not hoard reviewers.** Choose only 1 to 2 sources + codal . When you hoard reviewers you end up reviewing the same topics again and again and it's usually just the first part of the subject, nawawalan ka ng time to review until the end. I used my codal, one memory aid, and my 4th year reviewer book. That's it. 

**4. Give it your all.** Masakit sa pakiramdam na nawalan ka na nang pag-asa sa huling araw ng bar exam pero paglabas ng grade mo 74.99 pala. Kung tinodo mo sana pasado ka na. 

**5. Get enough sleep.** 6-8 hours a day. You will not absorb anything kapag sleep-deprived ka, trust me, been there, done that. 

**6. Can't understand something? Check Youtube.** While there are review centers who offer recorded sessions, mas mabilis mahanap ang topic sa Youtube. There are lawyers there who have recorded lectures, check it out. 

**7. Take care of yourself.** Alagaan mo sarili mo. Take a bath, take a walk, even while mentioning provisions you've memorized, enjoy your morning coffee. Don't punish yourself during the bar review, it will help you clear your mind and easy retention will follow. 

**8. Finally, Never give up.** You'll miss all the chances you don't take. What if eto na pala ang year na papasa ka and hindi ka tumuloy?

You crayon-eaters think you're smart with your charts and fundamentals? LOL. This is the Conservative Parallel Economy, and the real alpha ain't on Bloomberg.

Forget your lagging indicators and traditional news feeds. While you're waiting for the mainstream media to catch up, I'm already deep in the trenches, sniffing out the *real* market movers. How? By going straight to the source, baby! I've been getting millisecond-fast notifications when the big man himself, President Trump, or even the legend Devin Nunes, drops a truth bomb.

Remember that ""GREAT TIME TO BUY!!!"" post that sent DJT to the moon and printed a cool $4 trillion for the S&P 500 in hours? Yeah, my alerts hit before my coffee cooled. No cap, it's like having the closest thing to insider trading without the orange jumpsuit. This ain't just about catching a quick pump, either. We're talking about understanding the sentiment, the vibe, the unfiltered thoughts that move this volatile beast.

The recent moves are a prime example. We've seen the news about the $400 million stock buyback authorization: that's a serious power move from the board, signaling confidence and potentially tightening the float. And let's not forget the beta testing for global TV streaming with Truth+ and the international rollout of Newsmax. That's a massive expansion playing out, bringing more eyes to the platform.

And of course, the ever-present whispers about a TikTok acquisition are still out there, especially after the President's recent comments about a ""very wealthy group"" ready to buy it. If that deal even hints at becoming real, it could send this thing parabolic. These are the kinds of events that create massive market movements, and getting those insights the instant they hit? Priceless.

While the FUDsters are crying about ""fundamentals"" (what even are those, brah?), I'm out here scalping profits, catching those parabolic moves. It's not a secret anymore that Presidential communications, especially from Truth Social, can send ripples across the market that traditional finance bros are too slow to see.

So yeah, my portfolio's looking thicc, and it's all thanks to getting those unadulterated Truth Social signals faster than anyone I know. If you're serious about this, you need to find a way to get these alerts instantly. It's a game-changer. üíéüôå

I took to heart your advise and dropped back to 20 minutes for meditation - however, during pranayama heat and tingling came up, thought nothing of it, but as I continued in meditation heat arose from my sacral area, and continued up my spine, a high pitched buzzing rang through my ears and then a tremendous surge of energy pulsed through me. I ended meditation with a prayer and actually kept working with breath prayer, then did a 7,7,7 breath to calm down - the energy was so intense. I went out to see my husband to have him help ground me, and he could feel the energy pulsating through my hands and back as I was sitting against him - this lasted for about an hour or so. Now my question: Is this the bucking bronco you spoke of, or is this kundalini making herself known? I backed down in this morning's pranayama and meditation taking out sambhavi, mulabandha, and siddhasana. I just did spinal breathing and I AM meditation, I still felt energy pulsating and high pitched buzzing but not as intensely. My inner vision prompts me to continue in this way for 4 days, adding on sambhavi and mulabandha 2 days after the 4 day rest and see reaction, continuing onto siddhasana after I feel a balance. My quandary is this - Should I continue on with the advanced practices and try to train the bronco, or should I let the bronco relax and then try to gain control slowly? Also, FYI: Walks outside, yogic breath, belly breath and restorative poses are what I am going to use today as well as nervine herbs such as skullcap, oatstraw, and chamomile. I have eliminated coffee all together - who needs that artificial stimulation when you have this dynamo inside yourself?

A: There she goes. Kundalini, that is. The thing to do is be very intent on integrating all this into your daily activity. You are very wise not to blindly push practices ahead. Find that stable platform of practices and lifestyle that goes around the clock, 24 hours. Very important. You will know when it is time to press ahead again. The tools will be there when you need them. Your job right now is to stay on the rails. Or, as they say in rural Mississippi, ""Keep it between the ditches.""¬†

The ""bucking bronco"" referred to in siddhasana is sexual energy jumping around in the stimulation of the siddhasana seat. Over time, it changes and becomes very smooth and ecstatically blissful energy flowing up in the body like a fountain all the time. You seem to be making a sudden transformation, with sexual energy lurching upward into kundalini manifestation rapidly. It won't be that sudden for everyone. Everyone's nervous system is in a different condition according to past actions and practices -- that means way back before this life. You are right to stay out of siddhasana for now. And the other stimulative methods too. Don't hesitate to back off on pranayama and meditation also, if your symptoms make it necessary. You have plenty going on. Focus on stabilization. You can go back later and add stimulation into your routine when it is obvious you can use it.

Right now it is obvious you have enough to integrate. Make sure you keep physically active. This is essential for integration of kundalini energies into the nervous system. If necessary, you can also eat a heavier diet for a while to help smooth things out. Review the kundalini remedies in Lesson 69 and see if there are other avenues you are inclined to explore. It will get smoother as you continue on a course of ""grounding"" activities. Let your experience be your guide. The key to success in this stage is learning how to accommodate kundalini, and working with her. The yogi/yogini's role goes from instigator to partner. In time, you will find there is only one of you in there, and everywhere.

Keep in mind that this transformation is not an overnight thing. It is a long drawn out process that will take years to evolve. The nervous system has a lot of purification and evolution to go through. So, be prudent, patient, and settle in for the long haul. Slow and steady wins the race. We'd like to avoid having it turn into an ongoing roller coaster ride. Live a full and active life, and let your growing enlightenment live it with you. The journey can be so much fun.

(I need to vent, I'm sorry).","Today is my (27f) best friend's (29f) birthday. She asked me and another friend yesterday if we wanted to meet up for a coffee and I initially said I would while our other friend declined, but I woke up today and felt awful.

For context, I have generalized and social anxiety, an old sports injury that hasn't healed correctly and I recently went to A&E for BPPV. These things decided to rearrange their ugly heads up today, making me unable to go meet my friend. 

The part that sucks though is I have a history of being non committal. A few years ago, I said I would dogsit for her dad and his wife, unfortunately, my anxiety hit me like a freight train and my friend had to fill in, even though she lived a bit of a distance away. I've been told that it's ok and she didn't mind, we've met up and spoken since, but I get the sense that she gets annoyed at me still? Also the fact I still live locally to her dad and his wife isn't helping anything.

I was in my local supermarket with my sister when I saw them. I know I ruined their holiday , I knew that trying to start any conversation would just end with me being embarrassed. My sister and I were separated for a bit, they saw me and, I kid you not, power walked to the other side of the shop and left soon after. My friend doesn't know that, at least I haven't said anything. I feel absolutely terrible about that whole situation and I feel bad about today too. 

I was trying to think of a way I could still go, I was taking anti dizziness pills and painkillers, as well as my regular meds just so I could meet her, but I just couldn't. I'm overthinking everything. She told me today was ok too, but I still feel so useless. I hope that she has something else happening today but she hasn't said she has. I want to ask her if she wants to celebrate next week sometime, but I don't have the words to. I don't want to come across as self centered or paint myself as a victim, because I'm not either of those things, I'm just in my feelings and my brain is telling me I'm horrible. 

It doesn't help that I think the friend who declined is kind of annoyed with me too. His birthday was back in May, but I thought it was June for some reason. By the time I realised, it was too late and I just don't know how to bring it up and apologise for it. They both took me out for a late birthday celebration last year, and now I've just pulled this on both of them. 

Sorry for the long ramble, I'm trying to get this all down so it's not constantly in my head.

ETA: When I say I have a history of being non committal, I don't mean I cancel every plan I make. I just mean there's a small chance I don't feel well enough mentally or physically. I speak to and hang out with friends regularly.",4,1751727611.0,TrueOffMyChest,3,0.84,False
1lsbsyy,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1lsbsyy/clingy_older_friend/,Clingy older friend,"*First couple paragraphs are background/context, skip ahead to 3rd paragraph where I get pregnant if it‚Äôs too long.*

TL;DR: Older woman befriended me and is very clingy, immature and strange acting for her age. She wanted to throw me a baby shower, bugged me about it my whole first trimester and wasn‚Äôt listening when I told her i didn‚Äôt want to plan one right now. Gently told her I needed space and that it was stressing me out and she got upset/defensive and jumped to canceling so I pretty much ghosted her. Now she‚Äôs back begging to talk when there isn‚Äôt much left to say. I don‚Äôt want to be her friend and this was my out. Should I ignore her again?


I (30f) moved to another state a few years ago. Most of the people I‚Äôve met are either older than me or younger than me. I met a woman (53f) at work, she was friendly and outgoing and seemed very youthful. She invited me to the movies so I thought ‚Äòwhy not,‚Äô I didn‚Äôt know anyone else and didn‚Äôt think the age difference was a big deal, especially just to have someone to talk to and go out for coffee or dinner with.

She got pretty clingy pretty fast. It bugged me a little but I started wondering if I was the problem, like I just need to be kinder/more open to being social. Over the course of the next couple years a few more red flags came up. She seemed a little off the more I got to know her but I still hadn‚Äôt met too many people (I worked very part time and I‚Äôm not a mom yet so I didn‚Äôt meet mom friends, we don‚Äôt go out much and it‚Äôs kind of a rural area.) By ‚Äòoff‚Äô I mean the clinginess, her ‚Äúyouthful‚Äù attitude actually just seemed immature and a little weird for her age, overly sensitive, and she had gotten mad at me a couple of times for things that felt so high school. 

I stayed friends with her but definitely put up a wall and was careful what I said around her.

Well, I got pregnant at the end of last year. I was waiting until Christmas to tell my family but I wanted to share it with someone so I told her. Her immediate response was ‚Äúomg, I knew it! I‚Äôm gonna be the best auntie! I can‚Äôt wait to take the baby for the night! I‚Äôm gonna throw you a shower!‚Äù Like, a simple congratulations and hug would have sufficed. Well she IMMEDIATELY started on about the baby shower. I was 6 weeks pregnant at this time!!! She went on about it for awhile, I tried multiple times to tell her in different ways that I wasn‚Äôt ready to plan a shower. This was all before I was even 12 weeks. She‚Äôd asked me about a guest list (mostly her friends!!!) 
, where I wanted to have it, what kind of cake I wanted, etc. and each time I told her I wasn‚Äôt ready to plan. Either I was exhausted, overwhelmed, waiting for that ‚Äòsafe zone‚Äô at 12 weeks, I wanted to plan my shower with my family first to secure a date, etc.

I finally ignored one of her texts. It was about the cake and it was end of January. I was like 12 weeks pregnant. We didn‚Äôt talk for awhile and she finally messaged me one day asking if I was mad at her. I VERY NICELY explained that I felt overwhelmed by the shower talk and how I felt like she wasn‚Äôt hearing me when I was trying to tell her that I wasn‚Äôt ready to plan anything and I just needed some space as I was still in the first trimester, going through a lot. 

Her response? ‚ÄúWell I‚Äôll just throw out the invites, cancel the reservation, I‚Äôd already bought a few things. That way you don‚Äôt have to stress.‚Äù I told her i was still willing to have a brunch, it just hadn‚Äôt been a good time to plan. She kept going about cancelling so I said ‚Äúok! sounds like you and I both have a lot going on anyway and you‚Äôre ready to cancel so thank you anyway! It‚Äôs the thought that counts.‚Äù 

Of course she didn‚Äôt like that and back tracked saying we should talk about it over the phone, she just wanted it to be nice and do something special and that she needed time to plan. Well honestly I‚Äôm completely over it. I‚Äôm over the clinginess, the immature response of we can just cancel, the other weird things about her that I‚Äôve been tolerating. So I never responded to her. We haven‚Äôt talked now in a few months and just a few weeks ago she blocked me on all social media. Yesterday out of nowhere, she unblocked me and messaged me on Facebook begging me to call her. Like ‚Äúdude just call me, seriously let‚Äôs just talk, I miss us, this is crazy. It‚Äôs not like us.‚Äù 

I want to just ignore her again tbh. She‚Äôs almost 25 years older than me and acts like a teenager. She honestly kind of creeps me out. At the same time I feel like a jerk for ghosting her and how she probably thinks this is all because she was trying to be nice and throw me a shower. I‚Äôm torn, am I a huge asshole to ignore her again? I do NOT want to get trapped in a phone call and suckered into being friends again.

For starters, this happened about 7 years ago, so details may be missing, but it came up recently in conversation and I had mixed reactions on whether or not I cheated. I (21M at the the time) was in a relationship that had been going on for about a year with this woman (22 at the time), let's call her Tina. When we started dating and talking about expectations and boundaries, I made it clear that I'm pretty open and almost incapable of being jealous, but that I understand that not everyone is like me, so if she ever wanted an open relationship, I'd be okay with that but I would not care if she wanted to keep things exclusive. At first, she did not like the idea of an open relationship, so we kept it close. About 6 months later, give or take, she told me she had hit it off with a guy, that she had the chance to have a one night stand but of course, she didn't. She also told me this was not the first time that had happened, but it got her thinking that if it wasn't an issue for me, she would like to reconsider the open relationship discussion. All good, we set up boundaries and rules we were both confortable with and everything was good to go. I'm a pretty introverted person, with very little interest in sleeping around (did enough of that during my teenage years, I was already done with it by my 20s) so I things didn't change on my end for quite some times. She, on the other hand, was really extroverted, club going and energetic (part of why I liked her at the time), so she did have her flings every once in a while. All good so far.
The issue at hand: I met a girl about a year in the relationship, about 6 months after we opened the relationship, I legit don't remember her name so I'll call her Carla, 25 at the time I think. I didn't think much of her at first, I was a regular at her coffee shop and we got along, that was it. One day she ask me for my number and asks me out. This came out of the blue (for me, she probably was hitting on me before and I was to dense to notice) so I just said gave her my number and tell her I'd get back to her on the date thing. Y'all, this was new to me, I'd NEVER been asked out before so, I didn't know how to react. I of course told Tina as soon as I got out of the shop, and she seemed happy on the phone about it, like a ""good for you playa"" kinda reaction. I am autistic, so maybe I misinterpreted her tone or something, but at the time she seemed more than ok. I texted Carla that afternoon, explained that I was in an open but committed relationship and nothing more than a fling would happen between us, but if she was ok with that I'd be down to go on a date. She said she was cool with that. We set up a date and time, and I told Tina so she knew I wasn't going to be available that night. I went on the date, we hooked up, all was good, and I went back home that night (spending the night at other people's homes was a no go on our rules). Next morning I woke up to a call from Tina, asking if she could come over, I said sure, I had a day off so why not. She told me she'd take the bus right away (45 minutes from her home to mine), so I got up to get ready for when she arrived. Thats when I saw her though the balcony, standing in front of my house, looking around. Weirdo behavior but I'm sure there's an explanation, right? So I go do my morning routine and go out the door to greet her and tell her to come inside. She was pissed. She told me she'd taken the bus and texted me when she arrived to make sure Carla wasn't in my house, that I'd broken her heart by hooking up with her and that I cheated. I was confused, I assumed back then I maybe failed to communicate something, but she never clarified why that was wrong of me to do. I apologized and she told me I had broken her trust, and the relationship wasn't going to work as an open one. I told her fine, I would keep it closed on my end, but I knew how much it ment for her to be able to have her flings and her freedom, so I was ok with her keeping her side open. We landed on that new dinamic, same rules but only her side open. We were together for another 2 year after that, and in all that time I never knew why my fling was cheating. I recently told this story in a gathering with friends and strangers, as the only time in my life I've ever cheated on a partner. The reaction was super mixed, a lot of people telling me I didn't cheat, but a couple telling me I has an asshole for breaking her trust, and that I should have realized she wasn't comfortable with the date. So, I'm confused. Was I the asshole for going on that date? I'd be happy to clarify any questions in the comments",0,1751727438.0,AITAH,8,0.43,False

1lsbqkq,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1lsbqkq/should_you_buy_the_keurig_kmini_coffee_maker/,Should You Buy the Keurig K-Mini Coffee Maker Review for Small Spaces?,"**Compact Design for Tight Spaces**

Being someone who has very limited counter space in my kitchen, the **Keurig K-Mini Single Serve K-Cup Pod Coffee Maker (Model: B07GV2S1GS)** immediately caught my attention. Measuring at just under five inches wide, this coffee maker is a dream for small kitchens, dorm rooms, or office desks. Its sleek matte black finish not only gives it a modern vibe but also makes it blend smoothly with any d√©cor. I found the cord storage feature particularly thoughtful. It kept my countertop tidy during the testing phase and made it perfect for moving around when rearranging the space.

[Check Keurig K-Mini Single Serve K-Cup Pod Coffee Maker price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b07gv2s1gs/)

**Seamless Brewing Performance**

Operating this coffee maker is refreshingly simple. All you need is fresh water, a K-Cup pod of your choice, and just the press of a button. The brewing size options range between 6 to 12 oz, so you can match your cup size perfectly. I tested a variety of pods and was impressed by how quickly it brewed coffee‚Äîsteaming hot and rich in flavor within minutes. It delivers fresh and consistent results every time. Travelers, rejoice! The removable drip tray easily accommodated my travel mug, and spills were hassle-free to clean up.

**Energy-Saving Features**

As someone always forgetting to turn off small appliances, I appreciated the energy-efficient auto-shutoff feature of this coffee maker. It powers down 90 seconds after brewing, providing peace of mind and saving on energy use. This feature was particularly comforting when I used the machine in the morning rush before heading out to work. The K-Mini ticks the box for eco-conscious coffee lovers while still delivering efficiency.

**Strengths**

- Compact size fits in small areas effortlessly.
- Brews a range of cup sizes (6-12oz) to suit individual preferences.
- Cord storage helps declutter countertops.
- Energy-efficient auto-shutoff feature saves power.
- Broad compatibility with Keurig K-Cup pods and reusable coffee filters.

**Reusability and Customization**

Another standout aspect was the compatibility with the **My K-Cup Universal Reusable Coffee Filter**. I tested it with my favorite freshly ground beans, and it worked like a charm. This option makes it a great coffee maker for those who love sustainability or want to save money by skipping pre-packaged pods. However, keep in mind you‚Äôll need to purchase this filter separately‚Äîit doesn‚Äôt come in the box.

**Drawbacks**

Despite my positive experience, a few things stood out as limitations:

- A single-cup water reservoir requires refilling before every brew, which some may find inconvenient.
- Its lack of advanced features like temperature control or a display screen might frustrate users looking for more customization.
- Noise levels during brewing were slightly higher than anticipated.

**Competing Products**

When comparing this model to similar single-serve brewers, a few variations stood out. The **Nespresso Essenza Mini**, for instance, offers a more premium build and includes milk frothing for cappuccinos, but it‚Äôs noticeably pricier. On the other hand, the **Hamilton Beach FlexBrew Single Serve** gives an edge with its dual usage (both ground coffee and K-Cups) but is bulkier and consumes more counter space. The K-Mini strikes a great balance between compactness and functionality if you don't need specialty drinks.

**Value Proposition**

For the price point, this coffee maker packs a lot into a small package. Whether you‚Äôre brewing a quick morning cup or taking your time with a specialty blend using a reusable filter, it meets the essential needs of the average coffee drinker. While features are more basic than high-end models, its simplicity is precisely what makes it appealing, especially for overworked individuals like me who prioritize convenience. Travelers or those living in compact spaces will especially find value here.

I(late 20s F) have a dad (60s M) who has a nasty habit of while he does kind actions, his mouth is loud and unkind.He is one of those people who says it's the truth"" after saying some unforgivable words.

For man who does not believe in therapy, boy howdy he LOVES to use me personally as is therapist.Been hearing him talk mad crap about other family members ever i do try to speak up he mocks me for being sensitive or being bothered. My sister (earlier 20s) just had a breakup. out of respect no further details. Now my dad and sister always been at odds.she is the most like him and is the most defiant against his more controlling side of his personality. She and him both got that ""baby sibling"" drama mama personality, and  been unkind to each other.I can understand both sides so I tend to try to stay out of their beef and offer both [advice.at](http://advice.at) least her.

there is no giving advice to dad as ""his word is law"" in his eyes.I try to talk to her, tell her to ignore the bs but she should maybe try to follow through with the things she should be [doing.Today](http://doing.Today) dad made breakfast, normally I eat most days in my room (I pay rent dawg don't worry) and he in the living room but today he wanted to eat at the table. We sat, ate, discussed what been going on .But THEN, he went on a tangent. from talking about how unkind her ex was to saying nasty stuff about friends of hers (they are nice just different religion) then talking ILL of her to me.I just woke up, was already worried for her mental well being and he is over here dragging her and calling her ""not his daughter"". he saw me getting agitated and went ""what am i making you upset? it is the truth.""

He got up to get coffee and then turned to say again it is just the truth.I finally spoke up (which I rarely do) and told him firmly but without yelling ""just drop it please"". he went silent. I thanked him politely for breakfast as I ate. he said nothing back and left to go to the [office.No](http://office.No) slamming or mumbling, just him being silent. I just could not stand hearing him talk about her like that. Like whatever beef he had, I feel now is just not the time to talk like that. He can keep his distance but right now my sister needs time to heal and get herself [back.As](http://back.As) she heals, she can focus on herself and fixing what been damaged without a cloud over her.But him always having to beat a dead horse it will be hard.The man ruins attempts to fix things with his diddly darn mouth.(sorry, i know i spoke a lil silly but it is the only thing keeping my sanity and refraining from cussing up a storm.)

so TLDR: AITA for telling my dad to drop his negative talk about my sister?

I feel like an AH for telling my father to just stop talking about the subject.

I worry someone might think I am one for telling MY FATHER to basically shut up while I live in his house.I do not want to belittle his feelings but i did not want to hear my little baby sister being insulted by someone who is supposed to love her.Those kind of words you can't take back.",2,1751727060.0,AmItheAsshole,3,0.67,False

1lsbj9y,https://www.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/1lsbj9y/how_i_have_used_adultery_to_cope_with_adhd_a/,How I Have Used Adultery to Cope with ADHD - a retrospective introspection,"tl:dr; I have historically used r/adlultery as a kind of journal with questionable-quality internet feedback. Today I share about my experience learning as an adult about life with ADHD and how I've used adultery to mask, cope, and self-medicate. Haters need not comment. 

Hello fellow adulterers,

About a half year ago, I started noticing that friends would make comments like, ""That's not normal"" or ""Why are you like this?"" Some told me that they were living with ADHD and that what they saw in me was classic ADHD behaviours. Spoiler: They were right. I would often make commitments and forget about them, I'd start big projects but never finish any; my therapist asked me how I was in a crisis and I was almost elated to share, ""I'm on my game! Alert! Ready to go, at my best."" In hindsight now, years ago when my wife and I were sexually active she used to comment, ""You have an entirely different outlook on life after sex.""

I'm 40 years old now and discovered that due to improper production/uptake/etc of dopamine, I had instead become addicted to adrenaline and cortisol--otherwise I feel nothing. No motivation. Looks and feels like massive depressive disorder and general anxiety disorder. And since it looks so much like that I tried depression therapy and SSRI's, but they were minimally effective and the side effects far outweighed the benefits. A dysregulation of dopamine leads to an imbalance of over- or under-stimulation, always at the most inopportune or inappropriate times, of course. ADHD, clearly. 

But excitement and stress, you say? In the multilayered complexity of marriage where she acknowledges my need for sex but also does not want to engage in it, extramarital sex was the answer. And boy howdy has it worked so \_so\_ well. Of course now I am called to look back at why we are no longer sexually active, and today I wonder if any of my ADHD behaviours have put her off, or chilled our relationship; previously I was certain that she was not sexually attracted to me any more, and theorized that she is actually asexual, or closeted lesbian. I love her so much, whatever our situation is, whatever her situation is, and I rationalize that stepping out was a kindness to her since I couldn't keep fighting for something that she couldn't give. Is it true? I don't know. Have I harmed her by stepping out? I used to be certain that I was, but as I am rounding out a 9th year of adultering I wonder if she would actually be hurt to learn any of this--perhaps mostly that I isolated myself from her, that my betrayal was more emotionally excluding her than the actual act of sexuality without her. I can't really know without disclosing, and I will not. 

... I digress ...

Sex played a big part in learning to cope with or mask my ADHD. I still remember the first time I stepped out--I wrote about it in my old alt (secret! shhhh...!)--and how alive I felt. For the first time in a long time my brain felt dopamine, it was full of adrenaline and cortisol, excited and stressed, and I was hooked immediately. And still to this day, every time I am with AP, without fail, it is life changing. I wish I was exaggerating, to tell the internet that a sexual relationship felt like a cure. And now learning about ADHD I look back and understand fully how much a healthy sexual relationship could have saved my time, efforts, propriety. Neurodivergence or not, sexuality is definitely a base need of the human condition, but perhaps I have felt its absence more acutely. 

Turns out I have learned that I am capable of loving more than one woman. Is it polyamory? Is the love different? I dunno. 

To overcome the lulls of dopamine deprivation, I have my whole life engaged in risky behaviours. Always taking on big, novel projects. Reckless driving. Borderline substance abuse. Career changes (eight of them, full career changes with licencing and regulatory bodies and everything). And yes, adultery. 

Now I am taking medication. It's been about 4 months. Vyvance, 30mg, once daily, a stimulant with a slow release profile that has me crashing at about 9:00 every night. I can no longer ignore my body's hunger or exhaustion cues, but also I have meth mouth and food tastes bad and suddenly now caffeine works properly so trying to sleep after an evening coffee is a real treat. Small tasks require me to literally label that tiny feeling of dopamine so that I don't miss it, celebrate it, so that it becomes easier to recognize and feel. And I've begun the work of trying to understand why I am doing the things I'm doing--adultery is a thing I am doing that is highly stimulating, highly dopamine-rewarding, highly relationally rewarding, exciting and stressful. It checks all the boxes. I like to think myself h

Learning that I have been living with ADHD is both a relief and a new headache. I just want to be, I want to take a break from self-discovery and just exist. I hope that comes in time. Now I see my same ADHD behaviours in my oldest son. He's 11, and I won't make him wait til he's 40 to figure it out. Our family friendly early childhood educator identifies all three of my kids on the autism spectrum, and informs me that my wife's brothers and dad are too. Is my wife then also? Could that explain her dislike for particular sexual practices? Could it be a sensory issue for her? (She would literally swat my hand away and forbid me to ever touch her. Sex was always kissing to penetration, and it was mechanical at best. Now it's a dead bedroom since before the kids were conceived). My wife has regularly demonstrated support for my own discovery, and I am hopeful that by sharing this adventure of discovery with her that it contributes to the solution to remain each others' life partners. Maybe it lights a path for her to start her own discovery? Maybe one day I could have this level of clarity from her? 

But as always, I will spare her this part of my life. I will never take the risk that telling her about any of this is somehow beneficial to our relationship. I don't buy it. She would have to come to me and say that she knows and that she's OK with it and I'll still deny it for at least a couple decades. 

So, future CaptainUnfaithful, I leave this with you go come back years later, if for nothing else than to see how far you've come, or how far you've fallen. Don't get complacent. Be intellectually honest. Steady as she goes--no sharp turns. ",0,1751726789.0,adultery,7,0.3,False

1lsbh34,https://www.reddit.com/r/prozac/comments/1lsbh34/its_only_been_a_week/,It‚Äôs only been a week‚Ä¶,"Hi everyone. I started 10mg of Prozac recently for my anxiety. 

Throughout the week I took notes in my app of how I was feeling. I wanted to share them here.  

I have historically responded very well to medication, but nothing has ever targeted my anxiety this well. 

Day 1- I noticed I felt lighter later in the day, went grocery shopping, which typically makes me anxious because it‚Äôs out in public, but for some reason I wasn‚Äôt. It may be because it‚Äôs a quiet location who knows, but it was different.  Also much more clearheaded than usual.

Day 2- definitely lifted mood a bit. Felt a bit tired during the day, but I didn‚Äôt notice any racing thoughts. I felt anxious at some points but it seems to resolve itself pretty quickly. Towards the end of the day, I started to have thoughts that were kind of neutral/demotivated. I was trying to find something to be happy and excited about, scanning the upcoming week almost. 

Day 3- dreading the start of the week which is pretty normal for me. But it felt less intense and depressive, and leaned closer to neutral. Like I wasn‚Äôt having a million thoughts about why my life sucks, I just dreaded it being a Monday. I noticed I was quickly able to shift out of that mentality and reminded myself that I dread every week but it always ends up just being okay. 
 - Gave a Monday pep talk to my fiance and our pets before walking out the door.
- Getting to work was less frantic than usual. I walked slower, calmer. Feel more clear headed. 
- Less reactive to minor changes/issues that come up, more calm responses to people. 
- Less ‚Äòscared‚Äô of work email inbox.
- Making eye contact??!!
- Tasks are easier to complete, less worrisome thoughts around them 
- Thoughts are calm and filled with interests/hobbies as opposed to worrying about something 
- Started feeling really tired at lunch
- Drank coffee. No negative side effects, felt happy

Day 4
- Experienced a bit of nausea and light headedness. Good mood in the morning
- Initiating priority tasks at work has gone from making me anxious (like seeing an email reminder to do something literally making my heart beat out of my chest) to like cool calm and almost a bit excited to get it done???
- Initiating conversations about the weather? Holy shit. 
- Small things are making me smile
- money anxiety is also lowering, more comfortable making purchases that would usually trigger some fears for me.
- Conversation at work with lady who typically rambles worst case scenario conspiracy type talking points didn‚Äôt make me anxious in fact I was able to multitask and I was just calm?
- A bit of anxiety in the evening, no racing thoughts however and was much easier to let it go.

Day 5 
- mood is very good, neutral to happy.
- Felt drowsy in the morning, took a melatonin the night before, this may be why
- Things like client emails aren‚Äôt making me anxious, I‚Äôm just doing them. I can see where the confusion may be with anxiety vs adhd because it seems like the constant anxiety is what slows me down and stops me from actually taking appropriate action. 
- Client call made me anxious, not too many racing thoughts but the feeling in my chest was there. As well as the feeling of impending doom and fear of getting in trouble somehow 
- This event triggered some anxious feelings that seemed to last. Kind of needing to distract myself.
- It seems like I‚Äôm still able to maintain conversations regardless of the anxious feelings, like I‚Äôm not shutting down so to speak. (Shutting down or freezing from anxiety is and has been common for me, an entire day will go by and I was barely conscious of anything due to rumination and dread)
- My interests seem to give me a little more dopamine than usual, for a while things have felt slightly dull, for example I have always been a huge skincare fan, but recently I just stuck to a simple routine and never did any research on how to improve it or better deal with some of my problems, for the past 4 days however I‚Äôm back to researching and enjoying it.

Day 6
- I am feeling very optimistic about this medication. So far my only real noticeable side effects have been feeling sleepiness a bit in the morning, mild anxiety at times, and last night it took a sec to fall asleep. 
- I‚Äôve been getting stuff done, stuff that makes me anxious like financial aid, completing things in one fell swoop without the need to distract myself from the anxious feelings
- Bursts of excitement looking forward to things. Getting happy about little things. Feeling creative - I am generally a creative person but it hasn‚Äôt been that way since my anxiety got worse. 
- Still able to cry and feel my emotions, but they don‚Äôt seem to completely overwhelm me and ruin my day per se.

Day 7 
- Stood up to a family member. Telling it straight and standing up to him has always triggered my anxiety. This time it didn‚Äôt at all. 
- Felt a bit tired during the day and took a nap. 
- Good mood throughout the day.


TLDR: 
This medication is working so well for me and it‚Äôs only been a week. There is so much I didn‚Äôt expect it to help with.

I‚Äôm also slowly dreading life less and less.

We're thinking a 60"" screen and the projector is going to be (presumably) on a coffee table six feet away. The room has windows, but we're looking into blackout curtains. Ideally, though, we'd like the projector to work in a regularly lit (but somewhat dim) room. We'd like the picture to be good, but don't need movie theater quality.    

We've both been looking but are a little overwhelmed with the options. We've found some for ~$300 that have good reviews, but don't want to waste money on something cheap and ineffective. But we also don't want to spend thousands of dollars if we don't have to.

It‚Äôs not just about fiber for regular bowel movements or probiotic drinks like yogurt or kombucha.

What often gets overlooked is **prebiotic fiber,** a specific kind of plant-based fiber that doesn‚Äôt get digested by your stomach. Instead, it travels to your colon, where it feeds the good bacteria that help regulate digestion, support your immune system, and even influence your mood and skin.

The surprising part? Many traditional whole foods like unripe bananas, sweet potatoes, garlic, onions, and even fermented dishes are rich in prebiotics, but most of us aren‚Äôt eating enough of them regularly, especially with how busy and processed modern diets have become.

That‚Äôs why some are turning to gut-friendly prebiotic options that are easy to mix into coffee, smoothies, or water-formulated to be tasteless, plant-based, and designed for everyday convenience, even in hectic routines.

I'm 25 yrs old and I feel like i am just denied a normal life where i can enjoy and live at peace. At every corner there is something to throw me off course, knock me off my feet, I've been strong and resilient through it all, so much so that I took pride in my strength, not that I ever boasted about it, but that I was proud of myself for holding it together through the struggles.

I'm not saying that I'm the only one who goes through hard times, I'm not saying that I'm the only one who wishes things were different in life, but I'm only fucking human and it feels like I can't catch a break. It has become unbearable. 

When I was 8 my parents divorced and anyone who has lived that life knows exactly what I could put here so I'll spare you the 1000 paragraphs of painful moments I have to share about that. But I never let anything like that bother me, I was a young kid, I loved making people laugh, I was excited for the future especially when I entered high school and I never really thought about it, I realize now that was my way of coping, was just to not even think about or consider the fact that my life was completely fucked and abnormal compared to my peers.

Somewhere down the road, I decided to travel overseas to spend some time with my extended family, it was nice, and during that time my parents relationship started to strength tremendously because they had both stopped drinking, and I was maturing. It got to the point where they moved back in together because of financial reasons.

I came back to my home country, and for the first time in my life (that I could remember) I was under the same roof with mom and dad. I didn't pay much attention to it at first, but my heart was full, it was the breakthrough I needed. After so long, after my ENTIRE life, things for once seemed to be working, I would wake up, walk to the kitchen and see my mom and dad sitting together drinking coffee in peaceful silence. It felt like things were starting to turn around, and the 3 of us had really gone through hell to get to that point, it wasn't pretty.

Then, my father got hospitalized after a week long fever that was getting worse by day, he had a rare type of bronchitis, he died within a month. 2 months after that, my mother died from breast cancer that spread to her bones, lungs, and brain. Then, 3 months after that my aunt, whom I had stayed with overseas, also died.

Everything gone in an instant, and for what? What about everything that I had gone through? Things were so beautiful and the future was so bright but it didn't even last for 2 years, that's how short of a timespan I had it for.

Now to top it all off, my face looks like its melting, i have terrible acne scars around my temples and around my mouth and chin, it looks like I aged 30 years just overnight, and whenever I tilt my head down my cheeks droop like I'm an 80 year old, there are literally 70 year olds out there who look younger and healthier than me. I look worse than some people who have been on drugs or battling illness for decades and I just don't understand how it could happen to me.

That's why I want to end it all, because after all of my strength, patience, faith in God, i was left in return with absolutely nothing, my family is gone, my life is gone, and now, my face in en route, just as the cherry on top.

I have never considered taking my own life, and I can't really say that I'm planning on it yet, I still have to make an effort, I'm gonna hit the gym, get lean, see if my face works with me but to be completely honest, since nothing in my life has every worked with me, I am seriously having my doubts.

I'll give myself a year or maybe a couple, try to experiment with some things before I bite the bullet but I can honestly say I hope I either turn my life around complete 180 or I'm dead within a years time",6,1751726033.0,SuicideWatch,0,0.88,False

She just makes up stuff she thinks sounds accurate. I asked her why it causes autism and she said ""I feel like it would"" 

She started bringing up my mother who i haven't spoken to in 3 years. She always does this and its beyond annoying. My mom makes her cry regularly  but shes always acting like I need to accommodate my mother's mental illness/drug use that she refuses to work on. 

She also tells me I need to go on an ssri, shes on an ssri and has been since she was 6. She has the absolute worst side effects from it.

1lsb85y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hokkaido/comments/1lsb85y/trip_report_1_week_in_hokkaido_in_june_only/,Trip Report: 1 week in Hokkaido in June - only Public Transportation,"My partner (31F) and I (36M) just got back from our second trip to Japan, and this time we explored Hokkaido. Our first trip was the classic Golden Route : Tokyo, Mount Fuji (Kawaguchiko), Kyoto, and Nara. It was last August, which was amazing but super hot and humid. We chose Hokkaido this time for cooler weather and to avoid the rainy season. Here is a summary *(sorry, it is quite long!)*.

**Day 1: Tokyo ‚Üí Sapporo**   
We considered both options, train and plane, for getting from Tokyo to Sapporo. The Shinkansen journey to Hokkaido takes about 8 hours, including a transfer in Hakodate. It‚Äôs also significantly more expensive than flying. Since we only had one week to explore Hokkaido, we opted to fly. Several airlines operate flights between Tokyo and Sapporo, and we chose AirDo. We didn‚Äôt book any checked luggage, as AirDo allows each passenger one carry-on (up to 55 √ó 40 √ó 25 cm and 10 kg) plus a personal item. We each packed a small suitcase and a backpack. 

We took the 11:15am - 12:45pm flight, so we had time to spend the evening in Susukino, the entertainment district. 

Sapporo is famous for the food, so I would recommend to try local specialities : 

‚Ä¢Soup Curry : This is a Hokkaido specialty, and we tried it at Soup Curry King, located near the railway station. It was absolutely delicious, probably our favorite dish in Sapporo.   
‚Ä¢Ramen ‚Äì We went to Teshikaga Ramen in the Ramen Alley (Ganso Ramen Yokocho) and ordered their butter corn miso ramen.   
‚Ä¢ Jingisukan ‚Äì A grilled mutton dish from Hokkaido and named after the Japanese pronunciation of ""Genghis Khan."" 

We stayed at the Onsen Ryokan Yuen Sapporo. Highly recommend it! The rooms and onsen were fantastic. 

**Day 2: Yoichi & Otaru**   
We kicked off the day by taking the train from Sapporo to Otaru, then grabbed a local bus to Yoichi. There *are* some direct trains from Sapporo to Yoichi, but they‚Äôre pretty limited, so this combo worked better for us.

The reason why we wanted to go to Yoichi is to discover the Nikka Yoichi Distillery. The distillery closes around 3pm, so that‚Äôs why we decided to start with Yoichi instead of Otaru. 

If you're interested in a guided tour of the distillery, be sure to book several weeks in advance. We didn‚Äôt book ahead, so we just checked out the free self-guided museum and then hit the tasting bar. I tried the Nikka 10-Year Single Cask, and it was really worth it! If you are into Japanese whisky, I also really enjoyed Ichiro's Malt & Grain Classical and Hakushu, which I found in a couple bars later in the trip.

After the distillery, we walked about 30 minutes to Wilderness Coffee Roasters, a little seaside caf√© with amazing views. Super chill spot. If you‚Äôre not into walking, there‚Äôs a local bus that can get you there too.

To get from Yoichi to Otaru, we took the local bus again (only a few per day, but it lined up perfectly for us). You can also just head back to the train station and take the train instead.

Good to know : Google Map is really accurate in terms of bus / train / metro schedule !   
And if you have an iPhone, add a Suica card to your Apple Wallet. It‚Äôs super convenient for trains, subways, and buses. 

We got to Otaru around 4pm, which I‚Äôd say is the latest you should arrive. Indeed, most shops start closing around 6 PM. Otaru‚Äôs known for its glass crafts, and the canals are super cute. 

If you have time, I recommend going to Otaru, but honestly, Yoichi was our favorite. It is way less touristy and more 'authentic'. Ofc if you go to Yoichi you should prepare what you want to do, whereas in Otaru you can just walk around the shopping streets, so it is really depending on what you are looking for.

**Day 3: Sapporo**  
We spent the entire day in Sapporo, though tbh we had already seen most of the ‚Äúmain sights‚Äù during our first afternoon there. I checked out the Sapporo Beer Museum. The entrance is free, but I found it less interesting than the Nikka Yoichi Distillery. You can try the Sapporo Classic (only sold in Hokkaido) but honestly, you'll find it in most bars and restaurants around the region too.

In the afternoon, we went on a shopping mission as we needed *(wanted)* to do a day of shopping. If you're not into shopping, one day in Sapporo might be more than enough. We're big fans of Japanese brands and were already familiar with Muji, Uniqlo, GU, Edwin, Momotaro, and Japan Blue Jeans. This time we discovered Montbell, a Japanese outdoor brand that reminded us of Patagonia. 

If you are interested, there is also a Pokemon Center. I struggled to find it on Google Maps, so if you are looking for it it is located on the 8th floor of the Daimaru Department Store next to Sapporo Station. (and *yes* there is also a Don Quijote in Sapporo in case you wonder!).

**Day 4: Sapporo ‚Üí Noboribetsu**  
We left Sapporo in the morning and took the train to Noboribetsu, followed by a local bus to our hotel. Since it was my birthday, we treated ourselves and booked two nights at the Dai-ichi Takimotokan, one of the most renowned place in the area. The hotel itself is huge, a bit resort-like, but the room was very nice. If you book the Japanese-style room, be prepared for futon-on-the-floor sleep style :) 

The hotel is famous for hosting over 20 different natural onsen, including sulphur springs, salt springs, sodium springs, etc. The smell is quite strong at the beginning, but you get used to it (kind of). If you're not staying at the hotel, you can still visit the onsen as a day guest for a fee. 

The hotel is located just 5 min walk from the famous Hell Valley (Jigokudani). It is a must-see in Noboribetsu and it is quite impressive. You need around half a day to see the main spots, like the Oyunuma Pond and the Foot Baths, where you can dip your feet in natural hot water! I loved it.

Since we had the whole afternoon free after visiting Hell Valley, we looked into what else we could do in the area. We *thought* about going to the Bear Park, but after reading several articles online about the bad conditions the bears are kept in, we decided to skip it. 

Instead, we stopped by this little outdoor shop called Adex, just near our hotel. Super helpful staff. One of them recommended a hike with views over Lake Kuttara. He mentioned that bears do live in the wild in Hokkaido, but around Noboribetsu they‚Äôre *‚Äúvery shy‚Äù* üòÖ. So, we followed his directions and walked along the road until we found the entrance to the forest trail he had mentioned. But right at the trailhead, there was a Japanese sign warning that a bear had been spotted there two months ago. So yeah, we made the decision to turn back and stick to the road.

We ended up walking all the way to the Lake Kuttara Fan-shaped Observation Deck. The walk took about an hour, but we were disappointed by the view, which was mostly blocked by bushes. If you have a car, it‚Äôs a fine stop. But if you‚Äôre walking, like we were, it‚Äôs not really worth the effort. That said, we did spot a deer and a fox from a distance along the way, which was pretty cool.

We still wanted to see the lake itself, but the trail down was another 2 km of mountain path. Luckily, we ran into a super nice Japanese couple who offered to give us a ride. The lake itself is beautiful, but again, I wouldn't recommend walking there. 

Before we left Noboribetsu, we made one last stop at Pizzeria Astra. Their pizzas are made with Hokkaido cheese (or even buffalo mozzarella made from Hokkaido milk) and were honestly amazing. 

Overall, if you are planning a visit to Noboribetsu, and if you don't have a car, my advice would be : focus on the Hell Valley and the onsen. They are absolutely worth it. Stay one night there, or two nights if you really want to enjoy the onsen fully.

**Day 5: Noboribetsu ‚Üí Furano**  
We left Noboribetsu around 9am, took the train back to Sapporo, then connected to Takikawa, and finally hopped a local train to Furano. The whole trip took about 4.5 hours. The view from the last train was really amazing, as the train cuts through open fields and farmland. 

Looking back, I believe taking the Lavender Express from Sapporo to Furano is the best option ; but there is only one departure from Sapporo at 7:41am, and we obviously could not make it as we left Noboribetsu around 9AM. 

Furano is a cute little town, and you‚Äôll want to spend at least one full day there. I *highly* recommend renting bikes, and ideally e-bikes. We paid around 1 500 or 2 000 yens for 3 hours and we rode out to the famous Tomita Farm - July is the best time to visit if you want to see the lavender in full bloom. 

If you‚Äôre using Google Maps, it will guide you via main roads with traffic. We found that Apple Maps (with ‚Äúavoid main roads‚Äù or ‚Äúuse secondary routes‚Äù toggled) gave us a far more pleasant route, winding through fields and tiny countryside roads.

We wrapped up the day with dinner at an izakaya called Robata, the atmosphere and the food were amazing! 

**Day 5: Furano ‚Üí Biei**  
In the morning, we rode over to the Furano Cheese Factory. Here as well you can enjoy a pizza with Hokkaido cheese or buffala on it.

We then took the Norokko train around 4pm from Furano to Biei (we had booked tickets in advance at the JR station in Tokyo, but there are some non-reserved seats as well). The train has big open windows and moves slowly, so you get amazing views of Hokkaido's farmland and rolling hills.

Be careful, the Norokko Train will be discontinued in 2026, after over 40 years of operation.

We arrived in Biei in the evening, and ... yeah there was absolutely nothing to do there during the evening. I would recommend sleeping in Furano, and going to Biei on the next day.

**Day 7: Biei ‚Üí Tokyo**   
Since we stayed overnight in Biei, we took the 9:00am bus to the famous Blue Pond. Going early was a good call to avoid the tour groups. It is a very beautiful spot. That said, you‚Äôll probably only spend around 20 minutes there, so worth it if you have the time. But if your schedule is tight, I'd say you're better off spending your time biking around Biei.

After the Blue Pond, we returned to Biei and rented electric bikes again. This time we spent 3 000 yens for a full day. We rode along part of the famous Panorama Road, all the way to Shikisai-no-Oka Flower Park. The view there was really great and colorful, and I guess July is the best time to see the flowers blooming. It is very touristy though so be prepared. Still worth it, the bike ride getting there was incredible, though be ready for some uphill climbs. 

After biking, we took a bus from Biei to Asahikawa Airport, then caught our flight back to Tokyo, ending our 7-day journey through Hokkaido.



Oerall, if you're thinking about going to Hokkaido, DO IT. It feels way more ""wild"" and authentic. The weather in June was perfect, between 22 to 30 degrees celsius. And it is very very less crowded compared to places like Kyoto or other famous spots. ",5,1751725933.0,Hokkaido,1,1.0,False

ok so i cant drive. im codependent rn on family. im trying to get my car up and running so i can get my drivers license bc my moms car is not safe enough for me to learn to drive in, its broke down pretty much it keeps shutting off when she drives. so im codependent rn and have to rely on ppl. i hate relying on ppl it makes me anxious. im trying to get my drivers license as soon as possible so i can legally drive to work and work more hours so i can save up to move to texas with my biological dad. I want to move to texas with my dad bc i have a physically and emotionally abusive compulsive liar sister. Who is also pregnant. she has punched me several times and threatened to stab me. a few weeks ago she threw a container of chicken at my face bc she said ""u left this chicken out for like 3 days"" and i said no, i just cooked it yesterday right in front if u and even gave u a piece to try. she then cussed me out n said not every thing has to be an argument (even tho she was wrong). she has been abusive for forever and nobody wanted to kick her out bc ""shes mentally ill"" and now, pregnant. so im trying to escape that bc she abuses me the most and i dont feel very safe here. had to call the cops on her last year because she even punched my mom and pulled a knife out threatening to harm herself but i was scared in her psychotic episode she will hurt one of us. Well now, my stepdad and mom are constantly arguing. My stepdad is emotionally abusive and gaslights her when she expresses her feelings and turns my sister onto her as well bc hes immature and he knows he can. talking about divorce. my mom is codependent also. her car isnt safe, she works at a gas station, doesnt have a high school diploma bc she dropped out to take care of family and never got her ged. she is sick, doesnt eat enough nutritious foods and has to take tablets of vitamin d, iron, and vitamin c, if she doesnt start eating more nutritious foods she can die of organ failure. but she cant afford nice food for the whole house. it cost like $400-$500 a month for one person to have a nice breakfast lunch and dinner (and its not even enough calories its just chicken, veggies, rice stuff like that.) so imagine that x 3, about $1500 a month for groceries and thats not even including nice stuff like coffee or soda or dessert for enjoyment. (i buy my own groceries). so how is she gonna get better. so someone told her she can move out into their townhouse for cheap rent and get a job and there will be transportation there for her bc its a city. now im like, idk if i should move with her so shes not alone and help her, bc that will put my future even more on hold and put me behind in savings and idk if my sister would then move out of my stepdads house too and move in with mom, or worse, try to move to texas with me when im trying to escape her. a whole bunch of ""idks"" and everything is out of my control. I dont wabt to move with my mom if she moves with my sister because i dont wanna live w ny sister but also idk if mom will be able to survive on her own and sometimes im scared my sister will murder her or something. and then im like well maybe mom should just get a roommate because shes over 40 and never lived on her own and had her own bills or a nice job so maybe its a little bit her fault shes codependent and needed to grow up by now. But again shes getting sicker from stress and body issues. a few months ago she could of had a heart attack the doctors said. but im trying to get to a point where i can start a career, get an internship bc ill never be able to afford getting my bachelors. And i want so deeply to live on my own one day bc i cant handle jumping from abusive household to abusive household. and i cant live with my mom forever id like to have my own family someday, a partner, friends. i have only online friends rn. i just feel lost and dont know what to do. my sister has also stolen from me numerous times and made up insane rumours about me bc shes a compulsive liar and she hasnt gotten proper mental help or a diagnosis and its not like we can tell someone about her mental illness bc of her being a compulsive liar. she refuses to talk to a therapist and if she did she would probably just lie about her symptoms. we even had her sent to get help for a week but it didnt really bring about anything except for medication she didnt wanna take and refused to take for awhile then started taking them but i dont think they work.

We‚Äôve been married for 5 years with no problems. Recently she has started hanging out with him(36m) and ever since hasn‚Äôt acted the same. Hiding her phone with a privacy screen, when we are in bed and i roll over to talk and look at her she will lower the brightness before opening messages. 
It‚Äôs getting weird and I‚Äôm uncomfortable. As of recently she went to a work event and ended up going for drinks with all the coworkers (I knew this ahead of time) but at the end of the night I look at my phone and see she‚Äôs somewhere completely random(we have always shared our location purely out of convenience) I asked what she was doing and said that she is taking her friend home. She spent over an hour at his place at 3am. When asked about it the next day tried to lie that she was only there for 2 mins to drop him off. I told her I know because our friend group app says she was there with times. Ive never had an issue like this before. I eventually just moved on hoping things would go back to normal and telling myself it‚Äôs just a friend. Now I come to find that she is spending hours at his house when she told me they were going to meet at a coffee shop.

Some additional context:

I've been brewing coffee in my moka pot for the last two years, mastering the technique, but I've always wanted to get some good espresso, as the local coffee shops in my area are a terrible hit or miss (mostly miss).  
I've found a deal mentioned in the title although there are some caveats:  
\- it's used and not tested by the seller. The buttons light up, the electronics work and theoretically everything should be fine and they do offer a 14-day no questions asked return policy.  
\- I've got no experience with espresso machines and don't know what problems i should potentially expect from a used one.

Regarding the grinder, which some people complain about - I know you can adjust them so that it grinds finer, that should work, right? Also, I do have a TimeMore C3ESP PRO I use with my moka. No clue whether it should be better than the built in one.

Please excuse noob question.

I'm trying to achieve a 3-way filleted corner like the attached table on a bench I am making. I have pieces planed to 44mm and want to keep the width of the pieces as close to 44mm as possible.

As in the picture, I have an upright which extends floor to underside of the bench (z-axis) and is met in the other two axes by two ""cross beams"", coming in perpendicularly.

Any advice on the best way to create it? Is it as simple as use a very large radius router bit and sacrificing the material? Or should I add an ""interface"" piece that is slightly longer than 44mm, attach to the upright, and that piece then adds the extra fillet?

First off, we have a refreshment package that feels impossible to use. Only two places to get specialty coffee on the entire ship which the lines have normally been 20 minute waits most of the last two days. This morning I just wanted to grab a Red Bull from the promenade, they told me to get in line behind 20 people who wanted specialty coffees while the staff behind the breakfast counter were twirling their thumbs with no line at all.

Then, it feels like absolutely nothing is open on the ship. It‚Äôs 10am at coco cay, half the pools have been closed since we disembarked yesterday, and the slides have been down most of the time. Now yes, it has been raining some off and on, but it‚Äôs finally sunny right now, and most pools are still closed.

Lastly, it seems people have just forgotten how to behave in public. The windjammer is PACKED, but parents let their kids take up three different tables eating at one table each with zero care. I‚Äôve been run into at least three times. Teens walking around harassing people and cursing all over the place around kids. And it feels like EVERYONE is hacking a lung sick. 

That being said, the staff for the most part have been WONDERFUL and always do what they can. I understand it‚Äôs luck of the draw when it comes to weather, that everyone on board paid, and all deserve to do the things they want on their vacation, but it feels like the Allure last year had a lot more to offer.
