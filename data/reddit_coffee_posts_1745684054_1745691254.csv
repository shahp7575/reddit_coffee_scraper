I‚Äôve been undergoing prolonged stress from work (over 8 months now) and extreme burnout. Last week I wasn‚Äôt able to get out of bed and I used coffee just to get the dopamine boost that I need to get anything done. This is atypical as I do mma, workout and eat a very balanced diet for a few years now. It‚Äôs just the semi-recent stress from work and constant burnout has taken over . My work is extremely mentally demanding so for the past month I‚Äôve been using any energy I have there.


(I don‚Äôt take any medication, just whey, creatine and multivitamin + vitamin D prescribed)

Long story short, I went down multiple rabbit holes , came across semax, did a lot of research and decided to try it. This morning I took 300 mg (2 nasal sprays). I felt somewhat ‚Äúeuphoric ‚Äú immediately after - not what I was looking for not what I wanted. I am seeking healing , I want my brain to go back to normal and be able to use my memory properly and express myself conversationally and be able to read and hold enough context in my brain. Anyways I started feeling relaxed (felt like a drop in cortisol), no rage feeling, just this relaxed, serene feeling and 2 hours later I crashed (deep nap). I work up again and then found myself still exhausted and took another deep nap.

I meet this guy at uni (during a two year master program). I never really notice him, like him, or care really. At the end of the first year of uni, a friend we have in common told me that he liked me and had wanted to ask me out, but he never did it. Now with hindsight and knowing more, I realise that was right before he met his ex girlfriend. 

I do not think about this story at all, and had many other things to worry about at the time - I was healing from a breakup, looking for a grad job etc.

Anyways fast forward another year, he texts me to go for coffee (don‚Äôt think it was very romantic at that moment), and we hit it off, start texting etc. Everything is very chill and normal, nothing too serious. But he is being very flaky - we went for drinks, he said we would hang out the next day too. He then proceeds to get super drunk, texts me at like 8 in the morning (without telling me he can‚Äôt make it), and then wakes up right when we were supposed to meet. He doesn‚Äôt apologise or anything. I got super annoyed, and explained that this kind of behaviour makes me feel very disrespected. 

This happens many times - I have genuinely no issue with being cancelled on, but he always did it like that. Either it was very matter of fact, or I would have to ask if we‚Äôre still hanging out. 

I knew he was working this super intense job : 14 hour days, 6 days a week. I was okay with not having a lot of opportunities to see him, but I would often plan my time around him, saying no to other things, and then he would cancel this way. 

I put up with it for three or four months, because I really really liked him. We got along super well, he always seemed so kind and genuine, and although this was an issue I never really doubted that he truly liked me. 

However, after four months, he asks me what I‚Äôm doing the next day, and says he‚Äôll let me know if he can make plans with me. On the day, I ask him twice if he has any updates, and he doesn‚Äôt reply. Until 11PM, I receive no answer. I then tell him, very kindly, that I think we should end things because he clearly did not seem to have much time for me. He apologises but does not try to make it work - just something along the lines of sorry I wasted your time, I‚Äôve been struggling, wish you the best etc..


He reaches out a week later, we talk a little bit, and then the conversation naturally dies. I reached out a few times to ask how he‚Äôs doing etc.. and he always answered, we would talk etc. He‚Äôs always very kind to me - I told him about my new job and that I was having a hard time, he said he was always there for me etc.. I felt very guilty doing this because I don‚Äôt know how he feels, and would hate to make it worse for him. I have been on the receiving end of this and it‚Äôs always so hard - even though I never had bad intentions. Anyways, last time we talked was a month ago, when I wished him a happy birthday (he then asked me how I was, we talked for a bit, and then the conversation died on its own). Overall, since the break, he reached out to me once and I reached out thrice. 

I am now in a place where I miss him and want him back. A part of me keeps telling myself that I want him back because I miss the connection we have, but that I should not reach out again. My ego can be big , and I have this idea that if he wanted to talk to me he would do it, and so he clearly doesn‚Äôt want me in his life, and he‚Äôs just being polite. 

Another part of me is thinking - well you rejected him, and if you were in his shoes, no matter how many times the person reached out, you wouldn‚Äôt act on it etc.. You would leave them alone. 

I don‚Äôt know what to think, and I‚Äôm having a hard time making sense of it all right now. I‚Äôm not sure how to approach the situation, if I should just hold back and move on, or just swallow my pride and ask him if he wants to chat. If I do the latter, I don‚Äôt even know how I would approach this. I‚Äôve never been in the position where Inwalked away and regretted it so I‚Äôm just at a loss. 

I mainly need people‚Äôs thoughts on the situation, and any advice that could help me see this situation with more clarity. IDK if anyone‚Äôs been in similar situations and have some insights or things they wish they had been told etc.. ",1,1745690790.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False
1k8j71c,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1k8j71c/i_think_ive_figured_it_out_i_was_diagnosed_with/,"I think I‚Äôve figured it out. I was diagnosed with ADHD about a year ago and since treating it, I‚Äôm almost cured of my social anxiety.","This is a long one! 

I am a 31f and I have experienced major social anxiety all of my life. I thought my disorder was caused by complex trauma. While it may have triggered a lot of it, I think I found the root cause. 

About a year ago I was diagnosed with ADHD inattentive type. I have been through so much therapy for trauma and social anxiety and it has definitely helped. But since treating my ADHD and finally finding the right medication for me, I feel as though I‚Äôm 90% ‚Äòcured‚Äô. 

All of my life, I had never expected to be diagnosed with ADHD because I was never hyperactive and kept to myself all of the time. Little did I know, there are three subtypes of ADHD: inattentive, hyperactive, and combined. I think that most people don‚Äôt know this because everyone assumes that you have to be hyperactive to have ADHD. Inattentive type, however, is the most common. People with this type tend to not get diagnosed until later in life because we are better at masking our symptoms. Many women with ADHD are in this subtype. 

Growing up and even in adulthood, I thought I was just weird, into odd subjects, artsy, a loner. I felt like an alien not relating to my peers. The social anxiety was the main symptom, but not being able to comprehend my reading, unable to follow along with conversations, always daydreaming, distracted and forgetful, inability to start and complete tasks, inability to plan and super disorganized, food and weight obsession‚Ä¶it was really getting to me. 

I had mentioned to my roommate one day that coffee makes me insanely tired, it does not wake me up. She told me that that is a very common symptom of ADHD. I thought ‚Äòthere‚Äôs no way I have ADHD‚Äô. But then over the next few months I really read a lot about it. My husband even joked that I had ADHD often. Eventually, my symptoms got so severe and were resistant to normal cognitive therapy, I decided to consult a psychiatrist. I took my ADHD test and I had 8 out of the 9 markers for inattentive type ADHD. 

We started treating it with medication. I was scared to go on stimulants because I thought it would make my anxiety worse. So we tried Wellbutrin. It was good at first but I had a lot of crappy side effects and it eventually stopped working. Then, we started on a low dose of Adderall (5mg, then to 10mg). First, I felt no change, but then we upped it to 15mg and the difference is night and day. I have no more anxiety most of them time. And the added benefits of helping with my other ADHD symptoms are amazing. I may up the dose to 20mg in the future but I am happy where I am at for now. 

If any of you have experienced the symptoms I‚Äôve gone through, I would definitely suggest getting tested for ADHD. It‚Äôs life changing. ",1,1745690772.0,socialanxiety,0,1.0,False

I might text him with a music/movie suggestion, go all out with details about why I think he might like it ect. Then when we meet next or i text him a month later and ask what he thought he says he never got around to listening to the song or watching the movie. That's fine but don't act interested or say you'll look into it if you aren't going to... He never gives me suggestions, never asks questions, might text in a blue moon.

I used to spend $6+ a day on coffee, but recently I started using my DeLonghi Stilosa again. Now I‚Äôm wondering if I should switch to the Casabrew CM5418. The Casabrew definitely looks better and takes up less space, which is a plus for my kitchen, but I‚Äôm not sure if it works as well as the Stilosa. It says it has 20 bars of pressure compared to the DeLonghi‚Äôs 15, but I honestly don‚Äôt know what that really means or if it makes a difference.

Since I mostly make iced lattes, I don‚Äôt use the milk steamer much. My main issue right now is that I‚Äôm struggling to get a decent shot out from the DeLonghi. I‚Äôve tried different grind sizes‚Äîextra fine completely clogged the shot, fine only came out on one side and took forever, and slightly coarser made the espresso gush out way too fast. I don‚Äôt have a proper grinder because most of them are too bulky for my counter, so I‚Äôve been using a small electric blade grinder. I am open to buying a better grinder, but I‚Äôd like to keep it budget-friendly grinder.

I‚Äôm also thinking about getting a bottomless portafilter and maybe a puck screen to see if that helps. Right now, it takes me around 20 minutes to make a coffee and it still ends up tasting below average. Any advice would be really appreciated.

It was a normal chaotic day in the World Meeting.
Nations were bickering, throwing papers, trying to steal each other‚Äôs pens ‚Äî you know, business as usual.
And there you were.
Just trying to sip your coffee and mind your own business after breaking in as a human for some reason.
(Historically, coffee rationing had JUST ended in England post-war ‚Äî small detail, but you loved it.)

Suddenly‚Äî

Soviet Union, booming with terrifying friendliness:
‚Äú–ó–¥—Ä–∞–≤—Å—Ç–≤—É–π—Ç–µ! ‚úã Would you like to marry me, da?‚Äù

He gave you the world‚Äôs most intense stare. It was like being proposed to by an avalanche.



Before you could even blink‚Äî

America, sliding in at 100 mph, sunglasses shining like the sun:
‚Äúüòé Step back, commie. She‚Äôs not like the other girls. She‚Äôs mine.‚Äù

You just blinked slowly, looking down at yourself.
Messy bun. Hoodie with a coffee stain. Socks that didn‚Äôt match.

You, putting your hair into a messy bun because your abusive stepmom sold you to one direction:
‚ÄúBro, I literally get excited over coffee shop loyalty cards and kill my houseplants‚Ä¶
WHAT IS HAPPENING RN. ‚òïü™¥‚Äù



THEN.
The wall basically EXPLODED.

England, storming in like it was still 1940 during the Blitz (reference noted), trench coat flapping dramatically:

‚Äú‚ÄôEllo, darling~ üá¨üáß‚ú®‚Äù

You:
‚Äú‚Ä¶Did you just **Blitz** into the room???‚Äù
Him, smirking: ‚ÄúMaybe.‚Äù



It was too much.
The world spun.

You ‚Äî beautiful, stressed, and so very done ‚Äî
promptly dropped dead.

RIGHT THERE.



üé∫ FUNERAL TIME üé∫

France cried real tears, sobbing over your ‚Äútr√®s magnifique spirit.‚Äù üá´üá∑

Nobody knew.)

Everyone screamed at him:

‚ÄúSHUT UP CANADA NOBODY LOVES YOU!!!‚Äù

Greenland was still nonexistent.
(Not annexed properly until Denmark said so.)



The funeral was held in a crumbling old cathedral that England insisted was ‚Äúvery dignified.‚Äù
There were pigeons.
The pigeons were aggressive.

Everyone wore black.
Russia brought a giant fur hat.
America brought a cheeseburger as an offering.
France kissed your forehead.
Germany yelled at Italy for crying too loud.



üåü RESURRECTION TIME üåü

As the nations wept‚Ä¶

A weird golden light filled the cathedral.
Dust lifted from the floor.
Candles flickered.

And through the mist appeared‚Äî

(Actual history: Holy Rome was a mess of kingdoms, but like, he‚Äôs trying.)

He knelt by your body, touched your forehead

BOOM.

You gasped, sitting up straight.

Full review here!,"Testing the **Taylor Swoden Taylor Swoden-01 12-Cup Programmable Coffee Maker** over the past few weeks has been a real eye-opener in terms of what this affordable coffee machine brings to the table. As someone who cannot function without a strong morning coffee, I put this coffee maker through its paces and came out with some strong opinions ‚Äì both good and‚Ä¶ not so good. Spoiler alert: this little machine has strengths but isn‚Äôt without drawbacks.

**Design and Build Quality**

The moment I unboxed it, I noticed the modern aesthetic. It‚Äôs a sleek combination of black and stainless steel, which easily blended into my kitchen setup without looking bulky or out of place. The slim profile, measuring just 6.6"" by 9.4"" by 12"", was especially handy for my apartment countertop. However, I couldn‚Äôt ignore that the material, while visually appealing, felt a bit light‚Äîalmost fragile. Though there haven‚Äôt been any issues, I keep wondering about durability. 

**Ease of Use and Programmability**

What drew me to this coffee maker was the programmable feature. Setting brew times up to 24 hours in advance is a lifesaver when your mornings are chaotic. I‚Äôve managed to program it the night before, and I wake up to the smell of freshly brewed coffee‚Äîit feels like magic. The LCD interface isn‚Äôt overly fancy but does its job effectively. One annoyance, though, is the lack of backlighting, which makes fumbling with buttons in dim light slightly frustrating.

**Brewing Capacity and Strength Control**

With a 12-cup capacity, this coffee maker is perfect for family use or hosting a small group of caffeine-craving friends. One feature that stood out was the brewing strength adjustment. I tried both the ‚ÄúRegular‚Äù and ‚ÄúBold‚Äù settings, and let me tell you, the difference is immediately noticeable. The bold setting provided that coffee-house robustness I adore, while my partner appreciated the mild ease of the regular strength. The design also helps evenly saturate the coffee grounds, delivering consistent flavor, which is a plus.

**Cleaning and Maintenance**

I seriously love the cleaning cycle reminder. The flashing green light is subtle yet effective in nudging me to descale or deep-clean. The permanent filter is also a nice touch, saving the need to buy disposable ones regularly. However, cleaning certain parts felt a bit tedious‚Äîespecially around the drip area. For anyone who avoids meticulous cleaning like the plague, this could feel cumbersome. But hey, at least it reminds me when to clean, rather than letting grime build up invisibly.

**Pluses**

- The programmable brew timer is super convenient for busy mornings.  
- Adjustable strength settings cater to diverse coffee preferences.  
- A generous 12-cup capacity makes it perfect for entertaining guests.  

**Hurdles**

- The buttons and LCD interface could benefit from a backlight for early risers.  
- Certain parts, like the drip system, aren‚Äôt as easy to clean as I‚Äôd like.  
- The overall durability of the build feels questionable over long-term use.  

**Competing Brands**

Compared to other drip coffee machines, this model provides decent competition. Machines like Mr. Coffee or Cuisinart may have similar features, but they tend to cost more for comparable performance. Mr. Coffee, for example, often uses simpler interfaces but lacks certain features like the bold brew strength setting. Meanwhile, Cuisinart models feel more robust in build quality, though they hover at a much higher price point. Where this product shines is delivering programmability and consistent flavor without stretching your budget too thin. On the flip side, its competitors pull ahead regarding premium feel and user-friendly innovations.

**Cost-Effectiveness**

The price point is where I believe this coffee maker gets it right, offering programmability, strength settings, and a robust brewing capacity at an accessible cost. It‚Äôs not a product that screams ‚Äúluxury,‚Äù but if you‚Äôre focused more on function than frills, it fits the budget nicely. You don‚Äôt always need to spend a fortune on gourmet coffee makers‚Äîthis machine proves that. However, for someone wanting more high-end perks like built-in grinders or touch-screen displays, shelling out extra cash might be worth considering in those cases.

1k8iy2b,https://www.reddit.com/r/TopSurgery/comments/1k8iy2b/my_shopping_list_dos_and_donts/,my shopping list do's and dont's,"people are always posting asking what to buy/what not to buy, so i thought i'd compile what i bought/made/acquired/used under a few categories. please note this seems to be highly idiosyncratic, some people consider things i barely used to be absolute necessities and some of what i got that i considered to be the best purchase would have been useless for others.   
none of this is in any particular order, just the order that i remembered the things i got or that people recommend!  
  
**things that were absolute necessities:**  
\- neck pillow! helped me sleep sitting up more comfortably, especially when i first got home from the hospital and napped on and off for two days.  
\- reacher-grabber. helped me get a little more independent more quickly. i was able to open and close my curtains, grab items from the floor, and now that i'm more independent but still on mobility restrictions i can adjust the showerhead settings without roping in a housemate.  
\- plastic jewelry for piercings. i took out my more established piercings, but i have a VCH that i was worried about closing and is really finicky to get in and out, so i checked w my surgeon and he said a plastic barbell is fine (some surgeons require you to take out all piercings). i think it was in for about a week before i felt physically able and mentally ready to finagle my normal jewelry back in.  
\- tray table. i had meal prepped a lot of soup, and for the first week it was pretty uncomfortable for me to hold up a bowl for an extended period of time. having a flat surface to set food on was really helpful, though i did need my recovery buddy to move the tray around after i was done eating so i could get up to pee and stuff (we started calling it ""soup prison"")  
\- miralax. my surgeon recommended colace (docusate sodium), which i found completely useless -- there's actually a handful of studies now showing that it's not more effective than a placebo for post-op and opiate-related constipation. my post-op packet specified that it was ok to use my ""preferred bowel regimen,"" so i did a little research and found that miralax is highly recommended as a stool softener for people using opiates long-term, so i sent my recovery buddy to the store for a bottle of the generic stuff. it's truly tasteless and textureless so i could put it in any drink i wanted. starting the miralax and going back to my normal hot coffee in the morning set things right again but it was a harrowing few days. start the stool softeners BEFORE you start getting uncomfortable!!!   
\- maternity pillow. i slept sitting up on a wedge for a bit, and as i transitioned to being more supine i started using the maternity pillow. i'm normally a side-sleeper and it's helped me tuck my legs and head to the side while keeping my back flat. it's also honestly just really cozy, i started using it before i got surgery bc it's so comfortable to use as a side-sleeper.  
\- heating pad. sleeping sitting up, slouching, and the post-op binder have contributed to some pretty gnarly back pain.   
\- shower wipes & baby wipes! i was allowed to shower from the waist down and wash my hair carefully for the first 10 days, but i was very paranoid about getting my grafts wet, so i just had my caretakers gently wipe down my chest, back, and armpits. i would wipe down my own legs & belly, and then use baby wipes for my genitals & rear end.   
\- extra pillows under my arms. resting my arms at my sides put pressure on my drains in a really horrible way, so i lived with a soft pillow under each elbow until i got them out. i found most pillows were too firm/large, but the cheap throw pillows i got for my dorm 8 years ago were perfect.   
\- back scrubber/sponge or loofah w handle. it's hard to wash my back still, with this i can reach a little easier.   
\- extra tegaderm! for some reason the surgeon's office sent me 13 adhesives for 28 days of graft dressings, so i had to buy some. if your office sends you supplies for post-op care, COUNT THEM and make sure you have enough \*before\* surgery.   
\- rain poncho. wore it & some swim trunks to have my recovery buddy wash my hair after about 5 days. there were a few errant drops of water, but i don't think i would've been comfortable washing my hair otherwise.   
\- vest-style post-op binder. the wraparound version they gave me was hellish and didn't provide any compression on the upper armpit meat where i've had some swelling. the vest is a lot more comfortable, doesn't dig into my armpits or ribs, and is easier to hide under clothes if i'm out and about while wearing it.   
\- step stool. we have one in our kitchen, i've been able to reach most of our shelves with it which really helped with becoming more independent in the first two weeks.   
  
**things that were helpful, but i could've done without/would've spent less money on:**  
\- mastectomy pillow. has been good for riding in the car, but otherwise i mostly used it as a bib to keep me from spilling soup on my incisions. i made mine from scrap fabric & polyfill i had kicking around, and i'm glad i didn't spend any money on it because i've only used it a few times.  
\- overengineered wedge system. i'm really glad that i got a nice wedge to rest my back on, but i got one with wayyyy more pieces than i could possibly need. it had an extra leg pillow and a head and lumbar spine pillow that i really didn't use. the two back pieces also didn't really attach together and kept sliding down, which was really annoying when it was really difficult to adjust how i was positioned. but, i'm glad i had a nice wedge pillow for under my knees, and we ended up safety pinning the back pieces when i went to bed and that worked out fine. if i could go back i would have gotten the cheaper & simpler version with only a few pieces, and tried to find a version where the back pieces attach together so i wasn't sliding down so much.  
\- cutting a bunch of shirts down the middle/shirts that open in the front. for most of the first week i just went shirtless because i hated having anything touching the incisions or the bolsters, and i had cut a lot of tighter shirts because i though i wouldn't be able to get on a normal shirt to wear under the binder once i got it (my surgeon only gives a binder once the drains are out). but about a day after the drains came out, i was able to carefully put on a normal shirt, and the shirts i cut left an uncomfortable fold in the center of my chest under the binder. i ended up having to borrow some shirts from my recovery buddy, but i wish i hadn't cut so many of my own bc i wouldn't be making her do so much laundry!  
\- shampoo caps. i think they kept my hair marginally cleaner, but i still felt really greasy after using them and even the super sensitive skin version really irritated my scalp. i don't think dry shampoo would have been much better, i would recommend having a friend help you wash your hair more than i did (once in the first week, lol).  
\- peri bottle/acoustic bidet. it took me 5 days after surgery to actually need it, and by that point i was able to reach around my back to wipe myself. i think i maybe used it twice but given that i already had baby wipes it was a bit redundant.   
  
**things i didn't end up needing:**  
\- extra long charging cable. i can see why others would find this really useful, but personally my outlets are really close to my bed so it wasn't an issue.  
\- drain belt. my team gave me catheter stickers to keep the drains close to my body. you might be able to request these if they don't normally give them, i've seen others say you can just safety pin them to your pants/underwear.   
\- popsicles. i got my favorite kind (melona honeydew flavor) but while my throat was still sore from intubation i didn't really want to deal with trying to hold a constantly melting item, lol. i had my recovery buddy turn them into milkshakes, which we could have done with normal ice cream, tho i was quite happy to have honeydew milkshakes.   
\- travel cup/bendy straws. i already had a one liter water bottle that i keep a straw in, for the first week i would just fill it halfway so it was more comfortable to lift, and i could tilt it without it spilling so i didn't need a bendy straw.  
\- powdered/extra strength deodorant. my drain holes were right by my armpits so i didn't feel comfortable wearing any until pretty recently. the people caring for me did not care if i smelled like sweat! now that things have closed up a bit, my normal antiperspirant is fine.

I am planning on making some recruitment videos and stuff as squadron gets closer and closer. At this point I'm at 8/10 referral points in 9 years of active recruiting (friends and family) but I think that some of the people interested in Squadron more than SC might be an untapped market, so hopefully I can  ride that wave a bit.

I also really want to make a new mask now that I've learned so much about the process. I think this one is DECENT but I know I can do so much better now. there are 3 smooth-on dragon skin fx pro kits, a bottle of silicone formulated CA glue, and 2.5 packs of Sculpey Ultralight, all sorts of acrylic paint, 2 tubes of 100% silicone caulk, 4 or 5 nylon stocking hose, (hoes?) chrome marker, chrome spray paint, some coffee, (for aging/antiquing) scrap from some jeans, and for the form, a 20lb bag of plaster and 2 lbs of plasticine clay.

the teeth are essentially full dentures formed from thermoplastic beads (sold for making replacement teeth but theyre useful for all sorts of stuff) with each tooth  covered in visible/UV cure flowable dental composite (not quite  hard as tooth enamel but significantly harder than the thermoplastic, used to fix chips and make fillings). Fun fact, Amazon doesn't sell it to you without a license, but ebay does. if you're curious I used 3.5 to have this yellow color. I paid about $10 for a tube.

You can color platinum silicone with acrylic paint, it does catalyze the cure a bit, and you want to keep it below 5%. mix it into your B thoroughly then add it to the A.

don't let ANYTHING containing even trace amounts of sulfur, including some plasticine clays, plastic wrap, different kinds of solvent, etc. come in contact with the surface that you'll be coating, spreading  pouring, or molding with your silicone. I also wouldn't recommend using mold release for platinum silicone, once it's cured it peals off of anything that isn't silicone.

As I mentioned in another comment, it cost me probably $180 in materials for what I actually used, not including the wasted materials from mistakes and failures. if I had known what I know now I could probably make another mask for 130 USD.. still not cheap, but cheap-er.

It‚Äôs almost like BQEYZ has a Brooklyn accent, and that‚Äôs awesome. I wish more audio companies had accents. ‚ÄúYouse better wise up and put some BQEYZ in ya ears‚Äù

(BQEYZ does not endorse this message.)

Thank you for the review copy, BQEYZ.

Howdy y‚Äôall! Submitted for your viewing pleasure today: the BQEYZ Frost. I say ‚Äúviewing‚Äù to begin here because the set really wants your attention, please flip through the album. The whole electric blue vibe is really fun and distinctive; it would be a sin to unpair that cable from these IEMs. A lot of people in the culinary industry say ‚ÄúYou eat with your eyes first.‚Äù Well, I feel like a set‚Äôs look can sometimes give you an idea of its sound. That's sorta the case here with this 1 dynamic, 1 micro planar driver hybrid set. But it‚Äôs complicated. Let‚Äôs check it out.

# Look and Feel

The unboxing experience is very solid. Upon opening the box you‚Äôll find the earphones peaking out from their foam nest, their glow beaming bright blue from beneath the glass faceplate. The glass gives the design beneath a sense of needed depth and allows light to reflect off the set from within. This is the first set I‚Äôve ever demoed with a glass faceplate but I must say I like the concept. The cool shimmer of the glass compliments the metallic blue snowflake design beneath. This all sits atop a very nicely CNC‚Äôd aluminum shell. Over the last two weeks the earpieces have withstood two completely-intentional, on-purpose, for-science drops from about 3 feet onto a hardwood floor and are thankfully no worse for ware. These rigorous trials have led me to conclude that the build quality is pretty decent.

Yeah that‚Äôs a nice cable right there. The electric blue snake the set comes is one of the most perfectly paired stock IEM cables I‚Äôve come across. Sets double the price often don‚Äôt come with such a match, so the Frost is definitely picking up some points for style. The cable is slightly, but not overly memory prone while being thick enough not to become tangly. The double helix design is a popular choice these days, and the chrome hardware picks up the snowflakes on the faceplate. I got a 4.4 termination, 3.5 is available as well.

In addition, the IEM comes with 2 sets of silicone eartips (atmosphere and reference), a pair of foam eartips, a hard, roomy case and a little brush. I think it‚Äôs a great accessory package for the price, although I can‚Äôt speak too much to the quality of the stock eartips. I got them to work just fine, but I have a tendency to tip roll and use my own. Today, Tangzu Tang Sancai Wide Bore.

I measured the nozzles to be 5.7mm wide at their widest point. That‚Äôs on the wider side of average, but with the non-intrusive nozzle length I easily found a comfortable fit. Please note- my ears are cavernous. However the set itself is on the more compact side when compared to many hybrid IEMs.

# Sound Impressions

There‚Äôs reason attention has been called to the mid bass. But what may be just as conspicuous as its mid bass bump is this sets sub bass roll off,  leading to a distinctive presentation that may catch you off guard. We‚Äôre not here for the Rumble, we‚Äôre here for the Slam. Combined with a somewhat sparkly yet unobtrusive treble and a fairly sharp rise in the pinna gain, we‚Äôve been given an impactful and edgy set.

**Bass**

There‚Äôs a decent sub bass roll-off in this sets frequency response from around 50hz to 10hz that really focuses all the attention of the sets dynamic driver into producing a quick, clean mid bass attack the smacks you right in the face with every beat of a kick drum. While we may not hear too much of the lowest frequencies, tracks with lots of sub bass don‚Äôt sound anemic. The presentation of the sub bass is a soft backing canvas that makes the mid bass impact all the more affecting.

The mid bass is snappy and resolved. And attack reminiscent of BA Bass with a slower, more familiar DD decay gives the set a natural sound despite its exuberance.

**Mids**

We‚Äôre not really here for the vocals. That‚Äôs not to say I didn‚Äôt enjoy them, but they sit behind the rest of the presentation just a bit. ‚ÄúRecessed‚Äù would not be the word I‚Äôd use. Let‚Äôs go with ‚Äúrelaxed‚Äù. The mid range is warm and open, but it‚Äôs missing a bit of the underlying depth more subbass would bring. Male vocals can sound a touch hollow despite the warmth for this reason.

Due to that little upper mid range spike, guitars and stringed instruments are the real stars of the mid range on this set with an energetic delivery that you‚Äôll miss when it‚Äôs not around. Female vocals have a fairly strong and defined presence, but the ring of trumpets and whistle of woodwinds tend to take precedence.

**Treble**

It‚Äôs accentuated, yet controlled. Well extended, but comfortable. Some of the best treble I‚Äôve heard from a micro planar driver to be honest. Well resolved with formidable microdetail retrieval, the set boasts a treble that strikes a perfect balance between fidelity and musicality. The big 10k dip followed by a burst of air makes the set feel lively and refreshing. I found a few brighter tracks a touch sibilant, but I didn‚Äôt find it much of an issue in general. I found the treble to be the most source-dependent aspect of the Frost. A clean, neutral source is a must for controlled treble on this set. I used a DTC 800 for testing.

**Techs**

The soundstage is wide and spacious, but it‚Äôs not very deep. This leaves you in a slightly more intimate setting, and that sense of closeness is at the heart of this sets impact and energy. I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm watching the band in the middle of a giant arena. I feel like I‚Äôm at an open mic night at a small coffee shop that‚Äôs about to get shut down for breaking all the noise ordinances. It‚Äôs a set that puts you in the middle of the action.

The demure sub bass and hybrid configuration allow the set a clarity and resolution unmuddied by obtrusive low frequencies. The set had accurate imaging with very adept instrument separation. The set handles busy tracks well for its price range, and I was only able to notice some bass distortion when turning it up to volume levels I should not be listening to music at.

# Final Thoughts

I wasn‚Äôt really expecting what I got. It‚Äôs seems a sub bass roll off is a common feature of the BQEYZ house tuning, and I understand why. The snap and bounce of the mid bass is pretty addicting, and it‚Äôs rare to find a mid bass attack that quick outside of all-BA set. I listen to lots of rock, indie rock, pop, jazz and instrumental music. The Frost is great for the majority of my library, but it can sound a bit reserved on tracks that rely on lots of sub bass.

He came home with breakfast for everyone and then went to sleep while I got the kids ready for school. 

My plans were to take the kids to school and then go get my nails done. 

I wake him up to tell him I‚Äôm leaving to take the kids and get my nails done. 

I arrive at the nail salon that‚Äôs a few blocks over and I am going through pictures to see how I want them done this time‚Ä¶ and he calls me and ask ‚Äúare you going to go in the nail salon or not‚Äù (he has my location). 

I said yes I was just looking at pictures and he said ‚ÄúWell you‚Äôre taking your time‚Äù. 

I had maybe been gone 20 minutes at this point. I explain to him I was looking at pictures and I went into the salon and he was texting me the entire time‚Ä¶ which I telling him he should be resting but he then said he wasn‚Äôt tired anymore. 

Anyways after I got my nails done I told him I was going to go next door to old navy (they were having a sale) and he said okay but to hurry. 

I FaceTimed him while there to show him a few outfits and he told me to get one. I got his favorite one. 

Anyways I come home to get ready because I was going to take my oldest to get a hair cut because they had a half day..

When I was getting ready to leave he jumped up and said he wanted to come. Which I was happy about‚Ä¶ Anyways after shopping‚Ä¶ he said he wanted to take me on a date and we had an awesome night. 

I thanked him and told him how I had a wonderful time with him and how much I appreciated it. 

I don‚Äôt get these a lot because of his work schedule.

 Then this morning I wake up and I wanted to surprise him with something I know he has been wanting because he made me feel so happy yesterday while on our date‚Ä¶so I wake him up and I said ‚ÄúHey I‚Äôm going to the store‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll be back‚Äù he said okay and went back to sleep. 

I went to the store to get him his surprise and I decided to stop by old navy again to buy some bike shorts that I saw‚Ä¶ he called me and he said ‚ÄúI thought you were going to get coffee‚Äù and I said ‚ÄúNo I said I was going to the store‚Ä¶‚Äù he then says ‚Äúwhy is it taking you so long‚Äù (I had been gone maybe around 40 minutes at this point). I said ‚ÄúIm sorry I was getting you a surprise and then I stopped by old navy for those shorts I was telling you about‚Äù‚Ä¶ he laughed and hung up on me. 

I called him back a couple times and no answer and put back the shorts and then just decided to leave the store immediately and rush home. 

I got home and went to show him what I got him and he wouldn‚Äôt even open his eyes but said ‚Äúoh cool thanks‚Äù. 

Then I went in the room less then an hour later and said ‚ÄúHey do you want to do anything today‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a pretty day‚Äù and he said ‚ÄúNo‚Äù and he got up from bed and walked to the bathroom‚Ä¶ while in the bathroom he said ‚ÄúYou can go to the store but not get toilet paper‚Äù. I explained that was going to be my last stop earlier but when he called and hung up on me when mad‚Ä¶.I rushed home instead.. 

I then said ‚ÄúI‚Äôll go get it right now‚Äù and he said ‚Äúhave fun‚Äù I realized my keys were in the room and I went to the room and I realized he shut the door and locked it. Which is something he never does. I immediately started crying just feeling overwhelmed and had to immediately pull myself together. I ended up finding the spare car key and got the toilet paper and put it in front of the bedroom door. 

I texted him and told him the toilet paper was in front of the door and he said ‚ÄúI heard you put it outside the door which I had to get up and get it but at least thanks for going to the store to get it‚Äù.

I (27F) volunteer at a community kitchen every Saturday. It's super diverse ‚Äî people of all races, genders, abilities ‚Äî and honestly, it's one of the highlights of my week. It feels like what America should be.

Enter this dude (probably late 50s), strutting in like he owns the place, decked out in a MAGA hat, a flag hoodie, and that signature ""I haven't been hugged since 2003"" energy. I smiled at him because, hey, maybe he's here to help too. (Spoiler: he wasn‚Äôt.)

The second I say ‚Äúhi,‚Äù he launches into this gross rant about how ""immigrants are ruining everything,"" how ""lazy disabled people"" are ""milking the system,"" and how ""men in dresses"" (his charming way of referring to trans people) are ""sick.""
Mind you ‚Äî in front of a bunch of kids and families who are literally there just trying to eat dinner.

I smiled even wider (because if I‚Äôm going to burn you, it‚Äôs gonna be with a smile) and said, loud enough for everyone to hear:

A few people clapped. Someone actually offered to buy me a coffee afterward, lol.
But when I told my aunt about it later, she said I should have just ""taken the high road"" and ""not stooped to his level.""

After uni I joined a greenfield manufacturing company which was extremely toxic. I was their first recruiter but had tasks from sourcing a nanny to the ceo to event management to ordering coffee and securing tables to the generalists. It was hell, pure grinding. I left on the last day of my probation period, the girl i trained left a month later.

I was looking for my place, got a q year contract at a government firm where i did career coaching for unemployed people and did some recruitment as well.

From here I swithed to another 1 year ftc to a big agency where i was on site for an RPO as a sourcing partner. I had an hr admin on site with me and a few students doing sourcing. Contract got terminated due to covid but we even survived a client manager change.

From here i swithed to a tech startup where i started as a recruiter but after a year i ended up HRBPing for the dev teams. After almost 4 years, the market went sideways so we had to scale down. 

Before i got terminated i started applying and through an agency i found an hr manager position that looked decent. Freshly acquired manufacturing company in a period of growth. I went through the agency screening, had an interview round with the CEO and CFO. I got an offer the next day, though to a different position. Task was to manage the growth project. 2 generalists for recruitment, 2 generalists for administration and a marketing agency and recruitment agencies.
Offer looked good. On my first day i realised my contract doesnt match my offer: 3 documents had 3 different position names and the salary was lower during probation period, also contained moving wage. I flagged it and the generalists told me this is hiw they do it, position names doesn't matter anyway. I had 0 onboarding, team had continous conflicts and i was expected basically from my 2nd month to do overtime. Turned out position was promised to someone else on the team and i was hired because i don't have children... I left.

I was approached by a recruiter to a position i previously applied to, got screened. After one conversation with the CEO i got an offer. I was transparent during the interview that i have 0 industry experience and will need at least 6 months to take over. Ceo fired the previous postholder without notice before I started... Expectation was to hit the ground running. In my first 3 months i terminated 15 employees, 2 with no notice, got handed 36 contract modifications which included change in working time and salaries, had to do the review of handbooks, financial and headcount planning, plan another batch of terminations. I had 5 open positions, over the roof fluctuation (at least 2-3 employees a week), org chart redesign, onboarding. Ceo hired 2 people behind my back with no documentation... I had a government audit in the middle of january where it turned out i do not have the neccessary qualifications to be a postholder... It was true, the learning curve was extremely steep and I made a ton of mistakes. They didn't pay for the neccessary training so i left. By this time i was so overwhelmed i came home crying every day, didn't sleep, spent every weekend and night working.

Now I have another offer for a maternity cover and I am already scared and anxious. This time I applied, went through 3 rounds of interviews with senior professionals, which included a normal interview, a team fit round and a live problem solving ( a disciplinary action). The team there is at least 10 years more experienced than me, scope is bigger than I have ever done. 

Do you think I will be up for the task?

Do you have any advice on how to handle this crushing anxiety I have and ensure that I will perform well? I am completely unsure of my skills.

# Zyn Alternative: Top Picks & 2025 Buyer's Guide

Zyn nicotine pouches have become increasingly popular as a discreet and convenient way to consume nicotine. However, not everyone enjoys or can tolerate nicotine, and others may be seeking alternatives for various reasons, including health concerns, cost, or simply a desire to quit nicotine altogether. This buyer's guide explores the best Zyn alternatives available in 2025, focusing on products that provide similar oral stimulation and flavor experiences without the addictive substance. We will delve into key features, benefits, and comparisons to help you make an informed decision about the best option for your needs.

 ## Key Features Analysis

Choosing a Zyn alternative requires careful consideration of several factors. The most important of these is, of course, the absence of nicotine. Beyond that, texture, flavor, ingredients, and duration of use are all important.

**Nicotine-Free Formulation:** The primary feature of any effective Zyn alternative is the complete absence of nicotine. These products typically rely on other ingredients, such as caffeine, herbs, or flavor enhancers, to provide a similar sensation or satisfaction. It is crucial to verify the ingredient list and ensure the product is certified nicotine-free by a reputable third-party organization.

**Variety of Flavors:** Many users enjoy Zyn for its wide range of flavors. A good alternative should offer a similar selection of options, from classic mint and citrus to more exotic fruit and dessert-inspired flavors. The quality and intensity of the flavoring are also important, as this directly impacts the user experience. Some alternatives use natural flavorings, which may be preferred by health-conscious consumers.

**Pouches Material and Texture:** The material used for the pouches themselves significantly affects comfort and usage. High-quality alternatives use soft, durable materials that won't easily tear or dissolve prematurely. The texture should be smooth and non-irritating to the gums. Furthermore, the size and shape of the pouch should be similar to Zyn to provide a familiar feel.

**Ingredient Composition:** Looking at ingredients beyond nicotine is critically important for many consumers seeking a Zyn alternative. Many consumers choose nicotine-free options specifically to avoid putting artificial additives in their bodies. Carefully reviewing the ingredients and choosing alternatives with a minimum of additives is essential to choosing an alternative that meets your personal needs.

**Caffeine Content (If Applicable):** Some Zyn alternatives incorporate caffeine as a stimulant. If you are sensitive to caffeine or prefer to avoid it, check the caffeine content carefully. Some products offer varying levels of caffeine, allowing you to customize your experience. It is important to be aware of your daily caffeine intake and choose a product that aligns with your personal tolerance levels.

**Duration and Satisfaction:** The longevity of the pouch and the satisfaction it provides are key considerations. A good alternative should offer a similar duration of use as Zyn, typically lasting between 30 and 60 minutes. The product should also provide a satisfying sensory experience, whether through flavor, tingling sensation, or a combination of both. User reviews can provide valuable insights into the overall satisfaction levels of different products.

 ## Core Benefits

Switching to a Zyn alternative offers several potential benefits, primarily related to health, cost, and personal well-being. By eliminating nicotine, users can avoid the addictive properties and potential health risks associated with nicotine consumption.

**Eliminating Nicotine Addiction:** The most significant benefit is breaking free from nicotine addiction. Nicotine is a highly addictive substance, and using Zyn alternatives allows individuals to enjoy a similar oral fixation without the risk of dependency. This can lead to improved overall health and well-being, as well as increased control over one's habits.

**Reducing Health Risks:** Nicotine is associated with several health risks, including increased blood pressure, heart rate, and potential cardiovascular problems. By switching to a nicotine-free alternative, users can reduce these risks and promote better long-term health. This is particularly important for individuals with pre-existing health conditions or those who are concerned about the potential health consequences of nicotine use.

**Saving Money:** Zyn pouches can be an expensive habit, especially for frequent users. Alternatives often come at a lower price point, offering significant cost savings over time. These savings can be redirected towards other personal expenses or investments, making the switch a financially sound decision.

**Maintaining Oral Fixation:** Many users enjoy the oral fixation aspect of using Zyn pouches. Alternatives provide a similar sensory experience without the harmful effects of nicotine. This can be particularly helpful for individuals who are trying to quit smoking or other forms of nicotine consumption, as it addresses the psychological and behavioral aspects of the addiction.

**Improved Sleep Quality:** Nicotine can disrupt sleep patterns, leading to insomnia and other sleep-related problems. By eliminating nicotine from their routine, users may experience improved sleep quality and wake up feeling more refreshed and energized. This can have a positive impact on overall mood, cognitive function, and physical health.

**Are Zyn alternatives safe to use?**
  Zyn alternatives are generally considered safe, as they do not contain nicotine. However, it is important to check the ingredient list and ensure you are not allergic to any of the components. Individuals with underlying health conditions should consult with a healthcare professional before using any new product.

**Do Zyn alternatives provide the same sensation as Zyn?**
  While Zyn alternatives cannot replicate the effects of nicotine, many are designed to provide a similar oral sensation through flavors, textures, and other ingredients. Some alternatives contain caffeine or other stimulants that can provide a mild energy boost. The overall experience will depend on the specific product and individual preferences.

**How long do Zyn alternatives typically last?**
  The duration of use for Zyn alternatives is typically similar to that of Zyn pouches, ranging from 30 to 60 minutes. However, this can vary depending on the specific product and how frequently you use it. Some alternatives may dissolve more quickly than others, while others may provide a longer-lasting flavor and sensation.

**Can Zyn alternatives help me quit nicotine altogether?**
  Yes, Zyn alternatives can be a useful tool in quitting nicotine. By providing a similar oral fixation without the addictive substance, they can help reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms. Many users find that gradually transitioning to nicotine-free alternatives makes the quitting process easier and more manageable.

1k8ipnm,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1k8ipnm/can_delonghi_la_specialista_espresso_machine/,Can De'Longhi La Specialista Espresso Machine Truly Elevate Your Morning Coffee Game Review?,"Crafting the perfect espresso has been one of my morning rituals for a while. Recently, I‚Äôve been using the De'Longhi La Specialista Espresso Machine (Model B0CTKTFGL1), and it‚Äôs been an intriguing mix of artistry and engineering. If you‚Äôre passionate about a custom-crafted coffee experience, this machine looks like a promising choice. But, as with any purchase, there are things you might want to know before inviting it to take permanent residence on your kitchen counter.

**Feature-Packed Design for Every Coffee Lover**  
The espresso machine boasts a sleek, modern design with a metallic finish that complements my minimalist kitchen decor beautifully. The aesthetic appeal is undeniable, and its compact size fits neatly on the counter without hogging too much room. The build feels solid, and the attention to detail is apparent in everything from the control buttons to the sturdy milk frother. Speaking of which, the milk frother doesn‚Äôt just look great‚Äîit works like a charm, producing consistently smooth and silky foam that elevated my lattes significantly.  

**Easy Grinding for Consistent Results**  
Those 8 precise grind settings on the conical burr grinder are a standout feature. I tested multiple bean varieties, experimenting with fine and coarser grinds, and found it remarkably consistent every time. Making espressos for both myself and friends was quick, and the double-shot option came in handy for those caffeine-heavy days. Adjusting the grind size to find the best flavor was straightforward, making it accessible even for someone new to espresso machines.

**[Check De'Longhi La Specialista Espresso Machine price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0ctktfgl1/)**  

**Heat and Precision with Temperature Control**  
One of the first things I noticed was the active temperature control system with its three infusion settings. Coffee fans know this is an essential component for flavor extraction. In my experience, dialing in the correct temperatures for various beans felt like magic. Light roasts popped with brightness, while dark roasts had rich, mellowed depths. Once the temperature was set, the machine didn‚Äôt deviate‚Äîa detail I appreciated since consistency is king in crafting espresso shots.

**Why Latte Art Just Became My New Hobby**  
The inclusion of the ‚ÄúMy LatteArt‚Äù wand is where this machine truly shines for creative types. I‚Äôm not a pro barista, but this steam wand made me feel like one. The microfoam it produces is genuinely impressive. My cup became a blank canvas for hearts, rosettas, and some unidentifiable swirly shapes. I might even call it borderline therapeutic to start my day with a little foam art, and it certainly scores some extra points with guests!

**Highlights**  
- **Aesthetic Appeal**: Sleek metallic design elevates any kitchen‚Äôs style.  
- **Precision Grinding**: Eight grind settings deliver consistency for every cup.  
- **Thermal Control**: Maintains ideal brewing temperatures for maximum flavor.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- **Learning Curve**: While the functions are excellent, beginners may find the settings overwhelming at first.  
- **Water Reservoir Size**: I wish the water tank were just a tad larger. Frequent refilling was slightly annoying during busy mornings.  
- **Price Point**: It‚Äôs an investment and might not appeal to casual coffee drinkers looking for a basic machine.  

**Competing Products**  
When compared with other espresso machines in its price range, like the Breville Barista Express, I noticed a few major differences. The Breville‚Äôs grinder has slightly finer adjustments, which may appeal to hardcore espresso nerds; however, its frother doesn‚Äôt match the silky consistency of the ‚ÄúMy LatteArt‚Äù wand. On the other hand, the Nespresso Creatista offers easier operation for those less interested in manual processes but lacks the depth and control that this machine excels in. For those wanting both hands-on artistry and advanced features, this product feels like a stronger contender.

**Smart Spending**  
Considering the range of features offered, there‚Äôs certainly an argument for the value this espresso machine delivers. For baristas at heart or anyone chasing more creative control, the included barista kit and milk frother add dimensions not seen in some less expensive competitors. If you‚Äôre primarily focused on convenience and minimal setup, though, there might be alternatives that better fit your goals.

I don't like talking with strangers, or being in a crowd, or being in a crowd of strangers who expect me to talk. That's INTROVERTED, right?

Yeah, but many years after that meeting with that teacher, I'm thinking it might be a little more complex. A few minutes of cordial chit-chat with a stranger while we're waiting for a bus is *not* hellish. And I *enjoy* a long, genuine conversation when it happens, but that's soooo rare.

What happens instead is what happened a few days ago. An old pal wanted us to get together for coffee, and we wasted an hour talking about football and real estate and and his $265 shoes. He did almost all the talking.

I *am* introverted, but mostly I just don't want a long conversation ABOUT NOTHING ‚Äî the weather, or some TV show, or the new burger at McDonald's, or your day at work, or my day at work, or football, or real estate, or shoes. That conversation is agony for me, soon as it's stretched longer than two sentences.

**Socializing is 95% bullshit like that, so I'm 95% disinterested in socializing.**

Give me the other 5%, though, a conversation where the topic *might* turn to politics, religion, the absurdity of life, the definitions of art and soul, the evils of men wearing suits, the hypocrisies of all of us, or anything or everything else that matters during our brief existence on this planet, and *I am eager, ecstatic to listen and talk.* That's the conversation I hope for.

INTROVERTED is a handy one-word self-description, but it's more accurate to say: I'm a hermit who'd be happy as heck to come out of my shell, but NOT if it means spending another hour listening to someone babble about nonsense. If that's the only option, I'd rather remain alone every damned day for the rest of my life.",0,1745689340.0,introverts,1,0.5,False

1k8imh3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyGearReviews/comments/1k8imh3/explore_the_baby_joy_lightweight_stroller_bb4880/,Explore the BABY JOY Lightweight Stroller BB4880 Review: Is It Worth Buying?,"Testing out the BABY JOY BB4880 Lightweight Stroller has been a delight. With a hectic lifestyle juggling errands, outings, and a curious toddler who‚Äôs always on the move, this sleek umbrella stroller quickly became an essential part of our daily routine. Its design comfortably combines portability, functionality, and style, though there are areas that left me wanting more. What stands out the most? Read on to find out.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The frame boasts a durable aluminum material, complemented by a 300D Oxford fabric. Not only does this keep it lightweight (just 12 pounds), but it also feels robust enough to safely support a growing toddler. Living in a sunny city, I found the adjustable UV-proof canopy particularly useful. It stretched out to provide generous shade during those harsh midday rays and folded back neatly when not needed. The EVA tires, though light and easy to maneuver, do feel slightly less rugged for more uneven terrains like gravel paths. But for city streets and parks, they perform just fine.  

The pink theme? It‚Äôs an undeniable crowd-pleaser‚Äîpeople definitely commented on how stylish the stroller is during my outings. But might not be everyone‚Äôs cup of tea if they‚Äôre looking for something gender-neutral or subtle.  

[See BABY JOY BB4880 deals on Amazon now.](https://babycareshop.com/p/b07flv46gf/)

**Ease of Use**  
Folding this stroller is laughably simple. When they said, ‚ÄúOne finger can do it,‚Äù I was skeptical, but they weren‚Äôt kidding. Fold it down, secure it in its compact state, and you‚Äôre done. Carrying it through doorways or into car trunks is a breeze, even with a wiggly toddler in the other arm. It‚Äôs a parent lifesaver, especially for solo missions. The included mesh basket under the seat and cup holder became my go-to for holding everything‚Äîfrom diapers and snacks to coffee.

Even though the basket is marketed as ‚Äúlarge enough,‚Äù it‚Äôs worth noting the 3-pound weight limit. It left me double-checking how much stuff I was really carrying. Experienced parents know how every ounce adds up!

**Safety Features That Stand Out**  
The 5-point harness kept my little one snugly secure, and the two lockable wheels provide peace of mind when parked on sloped surfaces. Trust me, you wouldn‚Äôt want your stroller rolling away while you‚Äôre distracted for two seconds at the park. The security features build confidence, particularly for first-time parents who might feel nervous about stroller safety.

**Pluses**  
- The aluminum frame ensures durability without compromising on weight.  
- Effortless one-handed fold mechanism for busy parents.  
- UV-proof adjustable canopy for effective sun protection.  

**Adverse Aspects**  
- EVA tires limit the stroller‚Äôs performance on rough terrain.  
- A modest storage capacity of the basket below limits its convenience.  

**Performance in Urban Life**  
Using it in crowded spaces like malls and sidewalks, I loved how nimble the stroller felt. Navigation was smooth, and its compact folded size didn‚Äôt make me feel guilty for taking up space in the backseat of rideshare cars. Perfect for urban families on the go. However, wider trails during countryside strolls proved to be slightly less forgiving. Despite it being lightweight and easy-going on smooth surfaces, transitions on dirt trails involved a tiny bit more effort.  

**Competing Products**  
Comparing the BABY JOY BB4880 Lightweight Stroller to the Summer Infant 3Dlite Convenience Stroller had interesting takeaways. The latter also has a lightweight build but boasts sturdier wheels better suited for uneven paths. On the flip side, the adjustable canopy of the BABY JOY BB4880 is larger and provides better protection against the elements. For strict city dwellers, this might be the ultimate pick. For those needing a more robust travel option outside the city, competitors like the Kolcraft Cloud Plus Stroller offer better all-terrain features.

**Affordable Quality**  
The stroller feels worth the investment for an average day-to-day parenting lifestyle. With its blend of comfort, ease of use, and thoughtful safety features, it really delivers on value. Sure, it has its limitations, like the small basket capacity and terrain adaptability, but for its price and features, it‚Äôs hard to find better alternatives in the lightweight stroller category. A smart buy for parents looking at short yet frequent outings.

1k8il1g,https://www.reddit.com/r/golf/comments/1k8il1g/importance_of_warming_up_the_muscles/,Importance of warming up the muscles?,"Have noticed a pattern in my golf game. Early morning simulator practice tends to result in very awkward club feeling, slow club head speed, and horrendous contact. 

For background, I tend to do my practice after work every day, and the club always feels great, swing speed is good, and it allowes me to focus on specific mechanics. 

Today for example, I woke up, had a coffee on the couch, sat in the car for an hour, then arrived at the sim at started swinging. Horror ensued. The club felt weird, no feel at the top, no compression, swing speed dropped from what‚Äôs  usually 85-95 (113 with driver) to low 70s and 90s with driver. 

Googled it, and it says my muscles are tight, there‚Äôs no body/mind connectivity, and my whole  proprioception is thrown off causing  the club  to feel extremely weird and awkward in my swing. 

So what I‚Äôm asking, does what Google saying check out? Do u experience this? How important is getting the body ready and loose with respect to the club feeling ‚Äúright‚Äù in my hands and bringing that club head speed up and swinging through the hips?

Would love to hear your experiences and any tips/advice. Hoping for confirmation that it‚Äôs my lack of warm up that‚Äôs likely causing this, as when I play after work (even without a warmup, but my body has been moving all day) I hit the ball extremely well and eveyrhing feels comfortable and right at the top of my swing and I‚Äôm swinging through with my hips , etc.

Look at how the Montellis dont even have the decency to buy her a coffee machine. She's always drinking an energy drink, as you can see in her convene animation, even in the morning right after she wakes up she's chugging that sugary poison. They're clearly overworking her and undervalueing her existance by making her a guarddog at an underground bunker where the sun doesn't shine. Too much sugary foods, energy drinks and no sun can't be good for anyone's physical and mental health.

 If it was the Fisalias, Sebastian himself would be making her coffee personally, with cookies,  biscuits and a fresh garlic baguette straight out of the oven and the job comes with health insurance and daily checkups by Lady Cantarella herself. Also, a massage chair and office gyms would be made for our best workers because we care about our employees. 

You can get afternoon tea breaks with the Laureate of Rinascita and the Matriarch herself if you're lucky. I heard they do sports events on the weekends and seasonal picnic trips to Beohr waters and sightseeing on the Inverted Tower to collect mini drakes for our Lady with their best employees sometimes. The workers and maids say they see the Lord Arbiter leaving the mansion with kiss marks and fresh laundered clothes in the morning on a regular basis.

Poor Zani obviously chose the wrong employer being overworked and underpaid with no vacation, and i hope she gets to her senses and joins the Fisaliasüòîüôè

They are not physical abusers, though I do believe they are extremely emotionally immature and manipulative. I've been picked on by my mom since I hit puberty. For background, I have ADHD combined type and Tourette syndrome. My parents don't believe they owe their kids anything, and I've always been thrust into uncomfortable and mature situations to navigate on my own since I was very young. That doesn't mean my parents are strict, the opposite actually--they smoke and grow recreational cannabis, so when I was caught it wasn't so much a problem and I can smoke on the property if I wanted to.

my parents say they are progressive but I find they're extremely conservative regarding mental health. when I was old enough, I spent literally almost my entire 17th year in covid being tested and going to appointments straight after school because I knew from experience and I've heard my whole life that I'm different. obviously you'd think they would be more lenient if I have a neurological disorder that you can visibly see affects me, but you'd be very wrong. I still to this day don't think my parents believe I have ADHD or TS. They blame it on the vape. and my mom suggested changing family doctors right after I told her. so no support for that.

I'm feeling stuck because every time I interact with my parents now, I've upset them. If I talk about college--my life is easy compared to them. If I complain about friendships--I'm wrong and I'm making a bad decision. If I complain about work--welcome to adulthood. If my mother asks me about anything uncomfortable (which she begins almost every conversation with now) for example: me explaining that my boyfriend will be with his grandparents for easter dinner, and my mom immediately replying with ""do they know you're sexually active?"". Not where I thought the conversation was going.. and then any way I respond will result in her being offended. I didn't say enough, or I shouldn't ask why she asked me that because she's my mother and she's allowed to ask questions, or no reply at all will just have her staring at me like I'm crazy until she goes ""What."" like I did something wrong.

when I'm trying to explain to her why I'm upset or even any scenario that I am upset, whether it's my boyfriend or friends or school or work, it somehow becomes an attack onto her and she explodes on me. then I'm spiralling trying to explain myself and my dad will join in with no context and start screaming defending her. she'll turn to him and say ""no ___, this is what she wants!"" which drives me insane because who wants to be screamed at and teamed up on by their parents for saying that I'm tired from work. something that hurts me more is she calls me a bully and an abuser, usually after I defend myself, or attempt to but then she starts screaming at me to get away from her and that I'm making her uncomfortable. and if I try to defend myself like, ""this isn't what I wanted, I don't feel that way please stop saying that shit"", she'll scream bully! abuser! you're a bully, ____, and an abuser, leave me alone!

i can't even fathom the fact she tells me I abuse her, or that I intentionally seek out my parents screaming at me. and in my eyes and all I can see, I'm trying the whole time to tell them that I don't feel this certain way they assume I do. and i feel crazy.

obviously so much context is needed but i'm not willing to share it all as its extremely hard for me to even write this. wounds are so fresh from days, weeks, months, years and they just can't be healed. we went to a family therapist last month and I couldn't hold my shit together because she was lying to the therapist about what happens during our fights or extremely exaggerating it to make it seem like I am the sole perpetrator and she was just sipping a coffee or some shit. it made my blood boil, I yelled ""why are we even here for help if you are going to lie?"" and I left.

she forces me to pretend we are friendly around the house, immediately after she insults me. i am not allowed to show me being upset or she will question me uncomfortably with no way out. so we do speak regularly, and I have to act a very specific way or its the uncomfortable questioning which results in her being a victim.

i have no passion, no motivation for life. when im not with my boyfriend i think about taking my own life regularly. even at school or work, especially at home. my older brother attempted to twice and was hospitalized in 72 hour hold, he saw a psychiatrist and was diagnosed with BPD. he moved out a few months ago and he seems very happy and healthy. so i want to live to experience that. I'm realistic, I know life gets better, and I just have to move out when I have the cash. but idk how to heal these harrowing thoughts that take up majority of my day now. if you really read all of this i actually just want to say thank you, and thank you for not trivializing me (or i hope you dont lol) i really just want to be heard.",1,1745688936.0,ChildhoodTrauma,1,1.0,False

This comprehensive guide will explore the top contenders for 2025, providing reviews and comparisons to help you make the best decision. We'll delve into factors like material, insulation, customization options, and price, considering the diverse needs of our audience.

## Why Custom Travel Mugs? The Enduring Appeal

Before diving into specific recommendations, let's explore why custom travel mugs remain so popular. They offer a powerful combination of practicality, visibility, and affordability.

   **Practicality:** Everyone needs a way to transport their favorite beverages. A good travel mug keeps drinks hot (or cold) for extended periods, making it an essential for commuters, travelers, and busy professionals.

   **Visibility:** Every time someone uses a custom travel mug, they're showcasing your brand or message. This constant exposure makes them a valuable marketing tool. printed travel mugs seen on the morning commute or at the gym, provide repeated impressions.

   **Affordability:** Compared to many othre promotional items,custom travel mugs offer a high return on investment. They're budget-pleasant, especially when ordered in bulk, making them accessible to businesses of all sizes.

   **Eco-Friendly:** In an increasingly environmentally conscious world, using a reusable travel mug reduces reliance on disposable cups, aligning with sustainability goals.

## Target Audience Spotlight: Who Are These Mugs For?

Understanding the needs of different audiences is crucial when choosing the right custom travel mugs. We'll cater to:

   **Businesses/Corporations:** Seeking branded travel mugs for employee gifts, promotional merchandise, or conference giveaways to enhance brand visibility and foster employee gratitude.
   **Event Organizers:** Planning conferences, trade shows, or other events and looking for budget-friendly options to use as swag or handouts to further event branding.
   **Marketing Agencies:** Sourcing high-quality printed travel mugs for their clients‚Äô marketing campaigns, and demanding diverse customization options and reliable suppliers.

   **Individuals (Limited):** Searching for a small batch of customized travel tumblers for a specific event, like a wedding or family reunion.

## Key Considerations When Choosing Custom Travel Mugs in 2025

   **Material:** The material of the travel mug impacts its durability, insulation, and aesthetics. Common choices include:

       **stainless Steel:** Known for its excellent insulation, durability, and resistance to rust and odors. Stainless steel travel mugs with logo are a popular choice for businesses.
       **Plastic:** A more affordable option, frequently enough lighter but with potentially less effective insulation.
       **Ceramic:** Offers a premium look and feel, but is more fragile.
       **Acrylic:** A budget-friendly choice often used for cold cups or tumblers.

   **Insulation:** The quality of insulation determines how well the mug maintains the temperature of your beverage.

       **Double-Wall Insulation:** Provides better insulation than single-wall options.

       **vacuum Insulation:** The most effective insulation,creating a vacuum between the walls to prevent heat transfer. Insulated travel mugs custom are ideal for maintaining temperature for extended periods.

   **Lid Design:** The lid is crucial for preventing spills and maintaining temperature. Look for secure, leak-proof lids with easy-to-use closures.

   **Customization Options:** The available customization options dictate how effectively you can brand your travel mug.

       **Printing:** A common method for displaying logos, text, and images.
       **Engraving:** Provides a more permanent and complex look. Engraved travel mugs are a great choice for special occasions or corporate gifts.
       **Color options:** Choose from a wide range of colors to match your brand or personal preferences.

   **Price:** Consider your budget and the quantity you need. Bulk travel mugs and wholesale travel mugs are often more cost-effective. Look for cheap custom travel mugs if budget is a major concern, but don't sacrifice quality.

   **Minimum Order quantity (MOQ):** Some suppliers require a minimum order quantity.If you only need a few mugs, look for suppliers offering custom travel mugs no minimum.

1k8idtl,https://www.reddit.com/r/skincaredevices/comments/1k8idtl/reveal_the_benefits_of_the_carex_daylight_sky/,Reveal the benefits of the Carex Day-Light Sky therapy lamp review!,"The experience of using the Carex Day-Light Sky CCFDL2021US bright light therapy lamp has been surprisingly eye-opening. I‚Äôve tested a fair share of light therapy lamps over the years, but few have stood out with such strong performance and design. If you‚Äôve ever struggled through dull, gray mornings or felt the weight of seasonal gloom, you know how frustrating it can be to search for something that genuinely helps. This light therapy lamp has mostly lived up to its reputation, though I noticed a couple of limitations worth mentioning.

**Practical Design for Daily Use**

From the moment I unboxed it, the sturdy build of this lamp became obvious. It feels solid, like a product designed to last years rather than months. Historically, some lamps I‚Äôve owned felt flimsy and lightweight, often tipping over when slightly jostled. This one, however, boasts a strong polycarbonate base that stays firmly in place. The adjustable arm is extremely useful, especially since proper positioning is crucial for effective light therapy. By angling the light downward, as advised by my research, I ensured the bright glow hit just the right spots.

The downside of its heft came when moving it between rooms, especially given its size: the lamp measures 12 x 15 x 31 inches and weighs 8 pounds. Not exactly petite and portable. It needs a permanent setup location, which might not fit everyone‚Äôs lifestyle. If you live in a small apartment, you‚Äôll need to think carefully about where this will reside.

**Performance and Light Quality**

What makes the lamp special is its clinically recommended 10,000 LUX delivered from 12 inches away. I tested this feature thoroughly during my darker winter mornings, sitting near it for 30 minutes as suggested. Within a few days, the difference in my mood and overall energy became tangible. Morning grogginess melted away faster, and there was a noticeable lift in my spirit‚Äîa stark contrast to the typical sluggishness of previous winters.

Switching between its two brightness settings was another perk. While I predominantly used the high setting for therapy, the lower intensity worked perfectly as task lighting while reading or daydreaming over a cup of coffee. Some extra flexibility in the settings could be nice, though; specific color temperature customization might work wonders for tailored therapy sessions.  

[Check Carex Day-Light Sky CCFDL2021US price on Amazon.](https://agegene.com/link/b09xgprd3w/)  

**Good Aspects**

- Purpose-built with a clinical focus, delivering the recommended 10,000 LUX at just the right distance.
- Well-built with polycarbonate giving it durability.
- Features two brightness options, making it multifunctional for both therapy and general lighting use.
- Adjustable height and angle provide flexibility for tailored positioning.
- Flicker-free and UV-filtered light ensures safety and comfort over extended use.

**Areas for Improvement**

On the flip side, while the lamp excels in brightness, I did find that its size and weight present challenges for those wanting mobility. Lugging it around is a chore, especially if you‚Äôre someone who prefers experimenting with placement. Another shortfall is the absence of modern features like smart controls, which are a standard in comparable devices today. A Wi-Fi-enabled option to control it via an app would add substantial value, especially since my mornings are already tech-centric.  

- Bulky dimensions make it unsuitable for small spaces.
- Not equipped with smart functionality.  
- Lack of finer brightness customization beyond the two preset levels.

**Product Rivals**

In comparison to competitors such as the Verilux HappyLight Lumi and the Philips SmartSleep models, this therapy lamp clearly targets users looking for the most potent and comprehensive light therapy device. Where the Verilux lamp trumps with its lightweight and compact design, it falls behind due to lower brightness levels. On the other hand, the Philips models may offer more precise brightness control but often focus too much on aesthetics rather than therapeutic effectiveness.

Among these, Carex Day-Light Sky leans heavily into functionality and clinical research. However, it slightly loses ground when competing against the newer, sleeker products emphasizing convenience.

**Cost-Effectiveness**

For me, the price range felt justified given the premium build and therapeutic performance. Unlike budget alternatives which blur the line between gimmicky and effective, this device is worth the investment if battling seasonal affective disorder or maintaining year-round well-being. The long lifespan of the components, coupled with a design that seems ready for years of daily use, helps it stand out in terms of lasting value.

When I first received these true wireless earbuds, I was skeptical about how a refurbished model would perform, but they‚Äôve left me mostly impressed. As someone who uses earbuds extensively, from work calls to workouts, testing them in various scenarios brought out both their strengths and limitations.

**Sophisticated Design and Comfortable Fit**

These earbuds stand out with their sleek, modern design. The Phantom Black finish feels premium and pairs well with virtually any look, whether casual or professional. The semi-open-back form factor ensures a snug in-ear placement without feeling overly intrusive, even during extended use. At just 6.3 grams, they almost go unnoticed when worn. And the silicone ear tips? They didn‚Äôt create any discomfort, which is a big plus when I‚Äôve got them in for hours. Still, if you have unusually small or large ears, you might find the one-size-fits-all approach less than perfect.

**Sound Quality and Advanced Audio Features**

Rich sound reproduction is where these earbuds truly shine. With their dynamic audio driver‚Äîthe combination of an 11-mm woofer and 6.5-mm tweeter creates an immersive listening experience. Songs I‚Äôve been streaming on Spotify sounded detailed, with deep bass and crisp highs. The active noise cancellation (ANC) is remarkably effective for a product in this price range. Whether on a bus or in a noisy cafe, I could tune the world out. It‚Äôs worth noting, however, that ANC slightly falls short compared to pricier alternatives like the Sony WF-1000XM4, particularly for lower-frequency noise.

[Check SAMSUNG SM-R190 price on Amazon.](https://wirelessemporium.com/check/b0948f6zxt/)

**Water Resistance and Durability**

For gym-goers and outdoor enthusiasts like me, the IPX7 water-resistant rating is a lifesaver. I didn‚Äôt hesitate using them during light rain or sweaty workout sessions, and they didn‚Äôt miss a beat. While I wouldn‚Äôt recommend swimming with them, knowing that they‚Äôre protected for immersion up to three feet for half an hour adds peace of mind.

**Hands-Free Features for Everyday Convenience**

Voice detection has been a game-changer. I often find myself juggling coffee cups and answering calls simultaneously, and the Samsung intelligent voice detection lets me seamlessly switch from music to a conversation. The ambient sound mode‚Äîoffering four levels‚Äîalso allows some external sound in when needed, like staying alert in urban environments. Occasionally, I noticed the voice mode being overly sensitive, picking up chatter in the background. However, for most cases, it ensures practicality.

**Highlights**

- Impressive sound clarity with dynamic drivers.  
- Effective ANC for the price point.  
- IPX7 rating ensures resistance against water and sweat.  
- Voice detection and customizable ambient sound modes.  

**Battery Life and Charging Options**

Battery performance was solid but not exceptional. With around 8 hours of playback on the earbuds and 18 hours of juice from the wireless charging case, they easily lasted through a day of moderate use. Charging via the case was quick, and wireless charging capability is a neat feature. Additionally, the reverse charging option with compatible Galaxy devices adds versatility. For heavy users, you might find yourself plugging them in more often than premium competitors with longer battery life.

**Flaws**

- ANC doesn‚Äôt match higher-end alternatives in noise-blocking for certain frequencies.  
- Battery life, while decent, could be better when compared to others in its class.  

**Other Options**

In comparison to leading competitors like the Apple AirPods Pro, these earbuds hold their own well but reveal some limitations. While the AirPods Pro outperform in noise cancellation and seamless iOS integration, the SM-R190 is a more affordable choice with excellent water resistance and equally rich audio quality. Alternatives like the Jabra Elite 75t are also worth considering, offering slightly better battery life but lacking some of the advanced features like reverse charging and intelligent voice detection.

**Price Performance**

For their features and performance, the investment feels justified. While not on the absolute cutting edge of earbud technology, they deliver a balanced mix of quality, comfort, and convenience at a relatively competitive price point. Considering they‚Äôre a refurbished product, they bring bang for the buck to the table.

I joined FB years ago to play Scrabble.  I used a nick and a email I didn't use for anything.

Since my name was ambiguous I would get a pile of gunk. I knew it was gunk from glance since obviously my nick didn't exist so wasn't buying, joining, interested in, etc.

As time passed I checked a lot of people I know had accounts.  I messaged  them, revealing my identity as these were those whose weddings I attended, who I had coffee with, were related to.

I never posted a real image of myself.  In short...NOTHING PERSONAL.

This not only protected me but sensitised me to the various scams and the attitude of the mods, their political leanings and how they sell the various words used even in a private message.

Hello all, so I (33f) was invited to my best friend‚Äôs wedding back in 2021. So pandemic precautions are all around! 

I was 30 at the time & my ex bff aka the bride we will call Samantha (30f at the time).

Samantha had a difficult family life and she seeks comfort, friendship and refuge at my family home. (Yes my country doesn‚Äôt have a great economy for young folk so I was still living at home)
So we had a deep friendship for years! We met back in 2015 and I helped her open up to herself. Dealing with a lot of mental health issues and being able to be assertive while we were both in community college together. 

Fast forward to the engagement, so I was shocked by this as the year prior Samantha met Simon. Simon‚Ä¶I honestly couldn‚Äôt tell you what he was like because she never introduced me to him while they dated. 

Over the course of their dating history, I met up with Samantha for our usual coffee, and she would dodge the question, ‚ÄúSo when do I get to meet this new man?‚Äù
Dodged, ignored and I didn‚Äôt see anything off about this until after the fact. 

Then the lockdown happened so after dating for 18 months, Samantha and Simon were engaged. They were living together in his parents home in another county (state). 

So I wasn‚Äôt part of the wedding planning process at all which is fine because we stuck to social distancing protocols.
Samantha was a little distant, which is fine. Brides are hectic enough as it is. However there‚Äôs a difference between distancing and cold shoulder. I joked that ‚Äúoh am I at the singles table?‚Äù The bride took offence to this and found out Simon had put me with the singles of the parties. Weird but ok? 

Now, the travel day. 

I was offered a lift with the bride‚Äôs party to the reception via train and then from one town over to the wedding venue via bus coach provided by the venue. 
Once there I was dropped off in the countryside town to the B&B I booked. Room was quaint and then I went for a walk. Had a nice dinner at the pub around the corner. Some alone time because one of the bus goers was a 45M we will call Felix, who was leering a lot at me. He had a girlfriend. She was right there on the bus with me and helped me a lot. This is important for later. 

Now I returned to the B&B just chilled out after a day of travel and had a much needed self care night.

The Wedding Day,

To say it went smoothly was not what I‚Äôd describe the wedding. 
Guests were very polite and all that but people constantly came up to me asking about gossip about the Bride? 
Weird?
I was stunned and it turned out nobody on the groom's side was introduced to my ex bff and same with the other party. Then at the door seeing my friend in her beautiful wedding dress as we greeted her and Simon. The bride came up to me, hugged me and whispered into my ear ‚Äúmy Mom and brother aren‚Äôt coming‚Ä¶‚Äù then she plastered a smile and went on. 

A little bit of context: Samantha‚Äôs mother was emotionally manipulative, and her brother had been heavily influenced to become a Mama‚Äôs Boy so much so he was made to study nursing to care for his Mother. Throughout the course of Samantha's engagement, her mother yelled at her, saying things like, ‚ÄúYou are betraying me!‚Äù ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs going to take care of me?‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm heartbroken!‚Äù and ‚ÄúHe will abuse you, hurt you, and cheat on you!‚Äù To say she was mentally unwell is an understatement. When Samantha was a child, her mother experienced severe mental health issues, including undergoing electroshock therapy‚Äîyes, the type that is now illegal in our country (thank goodness). This treatment caused her mother to go missing for nine months; she had forgotten her whole life‚Äîher marriage, her children, her home. It wasn't until a neighbor found her wandering in a park that she was discovered.

Now, back to the wedding day.

After a brief hug, I was shell-shocked. It felt odd yet not surprising all at once. I mingled a bit, but I still felt out of place in my pantsuit. Eventually, I found my seat in the far corner near the bar, where I was placed with three men and one woman at the end of the table. The only guy who wanted to talk was very dull. He was a lawyer, more interested in watching a football match on his phone during the reception than in engaging in conversation.

After the speeches and the traditional festivities, I stepped out to the gardens to sit at a patio table for some fresh air. At this moment, Felix stumbled out behind me, clearly drunk. He was the most incel person I had ever encountered, and I felt terrified. Despite being a 6-foot tall woman, Felix towered over me. Just as he was about to lay a hand on me, another party member emerged and told him to back off: ‚ÄúStop harassing every woman and get back inside with your girlfriend!‚Äù

Felix stormed off, and I immediately felt sick to my stomach. I wanted to leave and return to my B&B. Suddenly, an explosion of yelling emanated from the dance hall while the party guest consoled me. Felix had decided to punch the father of the groom, along with some other guests who happened to be retired police officers. Because he hated police officers apparently? Great time to express that. 

I quickly grabbed my coat and slipped out to the front of the venue, where I found the bride shaking from the chaos. I consoled her, reassuring her that everything would be okay and that she had her whole life ahead of her as a wife, embarking on a new chapter.

I then made the midnight walk into town to return to my hotel room. Upon reaching the town, I entered the nightclub district to feel safer among people in case Felix tried to follow me.

Once I was back in my room, I became violently ill‚Äîwhether from the shock or food poisoning, I couldn‚Äôt tell. I felt terrible knowing that I had  the long journey home on the coach and then the train.

The next morning, after breakfast, I was picked up by the coach bus and sat far away from Felix and his girlfriend (who appeared to be in denial, even saying it was because he was autistic). Once on the train, I managed to secure a carriage away from them for the next two hours. I got off at a different station and made my way home.

In the following days, I didn‚Äôt hear from my friend Samantha, as she was away on her honeymoon. However, all her social media accounts were deleted, and her phone number had been disconnected. I presumed this was due to her controlling mother. Samantha took on her husband‚Äôs name and moved to his county (or state). I haven‚Äôt seen or heard from my former friend in over four years. I don‚Äôt recall doing anything to upset her, aside from her being offended at being seated at the singles table?

Although I honestly think it‚Äôs due to hiding from her mother altogether. 
Anyway that‚Äôs the Wedding Story I have for you all. 

Love you Charlotte and we cannot wait to celebrate your wedding to Mike. Does that make him our King Potato? ü•î

The post op pains have been reduced but some minor pains remain. It is too early to say if the op was successful but before op I read many comments and received valuable advices. 

I would like to contribute some of my experieces here to share some insights. 

\*\*\* I'm not a doctor nor mdical stuff, here I share only my personal experience.  
\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
**About the Surgery**  
I underwent lumbar spine fusion (TLIF).  
The procedure involved cutting open my back, shaving off parts of the disc and areas pressing on the nerve roots, and inserting a titanium device called a ""cage.""  
I never thought I would have to undergo such a surgery, but I decided to document the process here.

**\[Surgery Day\]**  
I arrived at the hospital at 7 a.m.  
Honestly, even after arriving, I couldn't fully commit to the surgery and told the doctor honestly.  
The doctor encouraged me, saying, ""It will absolutely succeed,"".  
I had to stop eating and even refrain from drinking water from the evening before.

I accidentally drank a little bit of watern at the entrance. After that, they took blood and I was put under general anesthesia.

When I woke up, the surgery was already over, and surprisingly, I wasn‚Äôt in much pain.  
The doctor said, ""It was a success,"" and I vaguely responded, ""Thank you.""

Immediately afterward, they asked me about lunch: ""Would bread be okay?"" and I naturally answered, ""Sure.""

However, in reality, I had no appetite at all and couldn't touch the meal they prepared.  
Even just sitting up was hard, and I couldn't make it to the bathroom.  
I could barely lift my upper body; without the relclining function, it would have been hopeless.  
Still, for some reason, I was able to drink Coke ‚Äî the sweetness was comforting.  
As night fell, the pain gradually increased, so I was given painkillers.  
Even then, I woke up in the middle of the night from the heat and a headache, and had to call the nurse.  
Opening the window and feeling the cold night air was a lifesaver.  
Here I suggest if you're going to have surgery, it‚Äôs best in the winter or early spring in colder weather. 

**Post-Surgery Day**   
The biggest thing I remember is the panic over not being able to urinate. I didn't have a catheter.   
They set this urine bottle next to the bed. 

Even trying to use the bottole in bed, nothing would come out, and I started getting anxious.  
A nurse advised, ""Try playing the sound of running water,"" and it worked.

That night, they changed my pain medication, and I managed to get some rest.  
Surprisingly, I could eat more at breakfast, lunch, and dinner than I expected.

Walking was extremely painful ‚Äî the wall just 3 meters away felt so far it was depressing.  
I could only shuffle my feet a little to move.  
The doctor told me, ""Don't bend your torso more than 45 degrees,"" but honestly, it hurt too much to bend that far anyway.

**Post-Surgery Day 2**  
I could eat a little more for breakfast.  
This was when I really felt I was starting to recover.  
They repetitively told me to walk. So I pushed myself to walk down the hallway.  
Walker here made it much easier ‚Äî honestly, I wish they had given it to me from Day 1.

I also realized that looking down even for an inch while walking still hurt.  
I felt firsthand how much we unknowingly use our muscles and nerves.  
The IV needle in my right hand was removed that day too. 

**Post-Surgery Day 3**  
I managed to walk a little farther this day.  
I could walk with the walker by my side without leaning heavily on it.  
However, the pain when getting up was still pretty intense.

I also tried taking a shower.  
With help from a nurse and a large waterproof bandage, it went smoothly.  
Every movement was painfully slow.

Around this time, I started thinking about work and contacting colleagues.  
I also got a little picky with meals ‚Äî when I said bread was hard to eat, they served Thai curry instead. It was amazingly delicious.

YouTube became essential for killing time at night.  
If possible, having Netflix too would be ideal.  
I highly recommend setting up your phone charger near your bed.

**Post-Surgery Day 4 (Discharge Day)**  
I ate a full breakfast, took a shower, did a little work, and then was discharged.  
I had arranged in advance to rent or buy a walker, cane, and grabber tool from a shop on the hospital's first floor.

The discharge came quicker than expected, but I was walking decently without a walker by then, so I guess it was fine.

Afterward, I rushed around gathering work documents and household items.  
I realized how crucial a good home setup was ‚Äî printer, monitor, laptop stand, etc.  
Since leaning forward still hurts, setting up the environment properly is vital.

**Post-Surgery Day 5 (First Day at Home)**  
This was a ""checking everything"" day:

* Can I sit on the toilet?
* Can I lie down in bed?
* Can I put on/take off socks and pants?
* Are necessary items within easy reach ? (tabe high)

Luckily, I had a sink counter near the toilet, so I used it to help myself sit and stand.

I spent the day quietly at home, getting groceries delivered to avoid physical strain.

**Post-Surgery Day 6**  
I focused on gradually increasing what I could do ‚Äî making coffee, washing dishes.  
I even went outside and walked to a nearby supermarket.  
My smartphone pedometer showed about 3,000 steps ‚Äî a perfect amount for rehab.

The beer I had afterward was delicious!

**Post-Surgery Day 7**  
A week after the surgery.  
I asked the doctor, ""How should I sleep?""  
I usually sleep on my side, but I had been sleeping on my back, staring at the ceiling, which was really stressful.  
The doctor told me, ""As long as it's not face-down, it's okay,"" which was a big relief.  
Finally, I regained some freedom in how I slept.

**Final Thoughts**  
Recovering from TLIF surgery is really about accumulating small steps every day.  
At first, you can't do anything, but little by little, you walk farther and start reclaiming your daily life.  
If anyone else is undergoing a similar surgery, I hope this can be of some help.

I was having a pretty good shift until I noticed it.

The note was pretty much asking us to t-pose all day without any possibility to sit down for even 5 minutes, even tho we always do everything we're supposed to within our capabilities.

They told us we're not allowed to sit down or slouch for any reason and at any time.

I work at a gas station and it's VERY busy, most of the time there are customers literally every 30 seconds all day, this is not an exaggeration.

**My manager is literally asking the SINGULAR employee on shift-**

***(There's always only 1 employee running the store while the manager is upstairs playing with their spreadsheets and fucking up the schedules and deliveries.)***

**-to not only handle the register-**

***(Remember, there's a customer every 30 seconds and people using the gas pumps require us to hit a button ON the register to allow them to gas.)***

**-but to also stock the coolers, stock the shelves, clean the kitchen, empty out the trash (also including the ones OUTSIDE), refill the coffee, refill the slushy machines, make new muffins and pastries, clean the toilets, etc.**

On top of that, the register itself requires to remember so many details it's unreal, including lottery tickets, bus tickets, counting the money to make sure everything balances and so on.

The thing is, me and my coworkers, we're already doing all of these. There's not one of us who I would consider ""slacking off"" because it shows and we know if it happens. I especially always do as many tasks as I can while also realizing that I am paid by the hour (Pretty poorly, I might add.)

I left my own notes on their note basically saying that it's unreasonable and questioning what they think we actually do because in their eyes, the second they see an employee sitting down to catch their breath for 5 minutes or look at their phone for a minute, it automatically invalidates all the shit we did while they were upstairs writing their shitty note.

I spent all of Monday doing literally everything, I even stocked everything we had been delivered which took 3 hours because I had to keep walking back and forth between the register and the back of the store.

Not a single thank you, nothing.

Then we get this note, I was absolutely livid and it ruined the rest of my shift.

**TL:DR: My manager wants a single employee to do the job of many while barely having any time to actually do it because of how busy the store is and they don't want to have to pay 2 people in the same shift to actually run the store how they want it to be run so instead they dump it all on 1 person.**

## Key Features Analysis

The best credit card holders for phones seamlessly blend functionality with protection, security, and aesthetics.

**Adhesive strength:** The quality of the adhesive is paramount for secure attachment to the phone. The most reliable models use 3M adhesives,known for their strong and durable bond. These adhesives ensure the card holder stays firmly attached, even during vigorous activity or demanding use.

A premium adhesive will resist peeling under various environmental conditions, including fluctuating temperatures and moisture levels. The holder shoudl be designed in such a way that the adhesive surface area is maximised to distribute stress and enhance the bond between phone and the holder. Many leading brands specify 'industrial-strength' to give users maximal confidence in their product.

**Card Capacity:** A crucial factor is the number of cards a holder can securely accommodate. Most popular models are designed to hold between two and five cards comfortably. Exceeding the intended capacity can compromise security and potentially damage the holder.

The design should consider card thickness to ensure secure retention without excessive stretching or damage to the material over time. Some refined designs incorporate internal tensioning mechanisms to securely latch the cards within the holder. Models that hold four or more cards are advantageous for users who regularly need access to multiple payment methods, IDs, or access cards.

**Material Durability:** The material from which the card holder is constructed directly impacts its longevity and resistance to wear and tear. Premium options use materials like high-grade silicone, durable elastic fabrics, or polycarbonate plastics. Each material offers unique benefits.

silicone is known for its versatility and shock absorption, elastic fabrics offer stretch and flexibility for accommodating varying card thicknesses, and polycarbonate provides robust impact resistance. The choice of material should align with user preferences considering factors such as tactile feel, aesthetic appeal, and frequency of phone use.

**RFID Blocking:** In an era of increasing digital security threats, RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) blocking is an essential feature. This technology prevents unauthorized scanning of credit cards, guarding against electronic theft.

An RFID-blocking card holder uses a metallic lining or specialized material to create a Faraday cage effect, shielding the cards from electromagnetic fields used by scanners. This feature is notably vital for individuals living in or travelling through densely populated areas, where the risk of RFID skimming is higher. High-quality RFID-blocking materials are rigorously tested to comply with industry standards and ensure reliability.

Key features of the top-rated credit card holders for phones include:

* Strong adhesive backing
* Secure card retention
* Durable construction
* RFID blocking capabilities

## Core Benefits

credit card holders for phones offer several key benefits that enhance convenience, streamline daily routines, and improve security.

**Reduced Bulk:** carrying a separate wallet can be cumbersome, especially when on-the-go. A phone card holder consolidates essential cards directly onto the smartphone, reducing pocket bulk and minimizing the number of items one needs to carry. This is particularly beneficial for individuals embracing a minimalist lifestyle.

Users report increased ease of movement and reduced discomfort, especially during activities like exercising or traveling.By integrating cards with the phone, it centralizes the user's essential belongings in a single device.

**Enhanced Convenience:** With cards readily available on the back of the phone, accessing payment methods becomes considerably faster and more convenient. This design eliminates the need to rummage through a wallet or bag at checkout counters. Quicker access to IDs or transportation cards leads to more fluid and seamless everyday transactions.

This integration also proves beneficial in situations where carrying a full wallet is impractical or inadvisable, such as at concerts, sporting events, or social gatherings. users appreciate the enhanced accessibility and reduced time spent managing multiple items.

**Improved Security:** High-quality card holders with RFID-blocking technology protect against electronic theft, safeguarding sensitive card data from unauthorized scanning. This added layer of security provides peace of mind, especially in densely populated areas.

By preventing RFID skimming, the risk of fraudulent transactions is greatly reduced. The physical retention mechanisms, combined with technological protections, create a robust defense against both physical and digital threats. Users perceive a higher level of security compared to traditional wallets, which are more susceptible to loss or theft.

## FAQs Section

Addressing common queries regarding phone card holders ensures that potential buyers are well-informed and confident in their purchasing decision.

**Are these card holders compatible with wireless charging?**
Compatibility frequently enough depends on the thickness of the holder and the placement of the charging coils. Some thicker models may interfere with wireless charging capabilities, while thinner, strategically designed holders allow for seamless wireless charging. It is advisable to choose a model designed with wireless charging in mind, or to remove the card holder before charging.

However, you can buy charging pucks, which are magnetic chargers that fit securely to the back of most phones.

**How easily can cards be removed and reinserted?**

The ease of card removal and reinsertion is dependent on the design of the card holder. Some models feature a cutout or slot to facilitate easy card access, while others require a bit more effort.Ideal designs strike a balance between secure card retention and straightforward removal. It is important to choose a product with a card removal method that aligns with individual preferences and dexterity.

It's also important to consider the tightness of the card holder. Models that grip too tightly may damage cards, while those that are too loose may not be sufficiently secure.**What is the lifespan of the adhesive?**

The lifespan of the adhesive depends on factors such as the quality of the adhesive, surface preparation, environmental conditions, and frequency of use. High-quality adhesives, like those from 3M, are designed to last for extended periods, often several years. Ensuring the phone surface is clean and free of oils before application maximizes the adhesive's longevity. Exposure to extreme temperatures or moisture can degrade the adhesive over time.

furthermore, repeated removal and reapplication can weaken the bond.

I have hardly any friends in my village. Most lads round me make me feel invisible, but when one actually acknowledges my existence by saying hello, I get confused if it's because he secretly fancies me, or if he's just being polite. I was bullied really bad in school by my 'best friend', before I had even come out, and tried to commit suicide a couple of times because of the way he made me feel. Several years later, this friend then came out as gay himself, and when I recently challenged him on his behaviour, by way of a handwritten letter (it took me years to build up the courage), he got his partner to message me and tell me to never contact them again, and he himself messaged my mother to tell her he thought I was mentally unwell! Anyway, that's just one story from several unfortunate events which have happened in my life. 

I'm generally a smiley, hard working lad, but I just feel lost and invisible, like I don't matter or belong.

1k8hlcv,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1k8hlcv/explore_the_ge_gx1s01r_water_filtration_system/,Explore the GE GX1S01R Water Filtration System Review Is It Worth It?,"The GE GX1S01R Single Stage Water Filtration System & Filter is a compelling option for anyone seeking clean, fresh water right from their kitchen sink. Having tested it daily for a couple of weeks, I can say this system delivers on most of its promises, although there are a few things to keep in mind. It‚Äôs convenient, compact, and effective, but it‚Äôs not without some quirks.

**Streamlined Installation and Compact Design**

Carving out time to set up a new home appliance can be a pain, but this water filtration system makes the process pretty manageable. The under-sink design ensures it doesn‚Äôt clutter your kitchen, which is appreciated in my small apartment. It came with a mounting bracket that simplified the installation, although I did have to run to the store for a compatible chrome faucet since it‚Äôs sold separately. That said, the instructions were clear, and the whole process took about 45 minutes. No rocket science required, which is always a win.

**Premium Filtration Results**

This system‚Äôs filtration prowess is impressive. It includes the FXULC filter, which is certified to reduce lead, chlorine, and a handful of other contaminants, giving drinking water a crisp and clean taste. Living in an area with hard water, I noticed an immediate improvement in taste and clarity. I tested it with different beverages (coffee and tea aficionados, rejoice) and found the flavors genuinely better with filtered water. The fact that it only filters once may sound basic, but it gets the job done without overcomplicating things.

[Ready to buy GE GX1S01R? Click for Amazon pricing.](https://usedwater.com/price/b0c5p4kp33/)

**Ease of Maintenance**

This isn‚Äôt one of those systems you install and forget. Its six-month filter life is decent, and replacing the FXULC filter is straightforward, but you‚Äôll have to keep up with it to maintain performance. Six months sounds fine, but if you‚Äôre in a household that uses heaps of water, you might find yourself swapping out filters more frequently. My family noticed a bit of a drop in taste quality around the five-month mark, so keep an eye on that.

**Boons**

- Impressive water taste improvement with premium filtration.  
- Straightforward under-sink installation with clear instructions.  
- Compact design fits neatly without taking up valuable space.  

**Critiques**

- The chrome faucet required for installation isn‚Äôt included in the package.  
- Six-month filter life may feel short for households with heavy usage.  

**Performance Under Different Conditions**

The system performed admirably within the temperature range specified (40¬∞F to 100¬∞F). Admittingly, I tend to ignore those details until an appliance breaks, but this one worked consistently even after a particularly cold week. However, it‚Äôs crucial to note that it operates manually‚Äîno fancy digital displays or monitoring systems here. That simplicity might bug some folks looking for high-tech features.  

**Competing Products**

I‚Äôve previously used Brita and PUR countertop pitchers, but they can't hold a candle to this system in terms of water quality and convenience. Unlike those pitchers, I don‚Äôt have to wait for water to filter every single time or refill the pitcher multiple times a day. However, I‚Äôll admit a pitcher is significantly cheaper upfront, while similar under-sink systems like the Culligan US-600 may come close in function but are less sleek in design.

**Cost-Effectiveness**

Let‚Äôs talk about value. The GE GX1S01R strikes a balance between quality and cost. It‚Äôs more of a mid-tier solution‚Äînot the cheapest, not the priciest. For someone like me, who hates mediocre water quality but doesn‚Äôt want to splurge on high-end filtration systems, it fits the bill. I cringe at the idea of spending more on bottled water, so investing here feels like a long-term win for my wallet and the planet. Still, if you‚Äôre on a tight budget, it might take some convincing.

As a result I mainly saw their few standard greetings recycled over and over again without ever realizing that there is way more dialogue than that for each personality. For a long time I also felt compelled to craft my own tools instead of buying them, and so collecting materials and crafting was a major chore. When I started buying tools it made the game way better. However, in the early game this isn't a good option when you are trying to save up for house expansions, so I still think this should be improved, along with other QOL issues like doing various things in bulk, being able to fly from a mystery island to another mystery island, easy terraforming, etc.

I know many people say that NH no longer feels like a life sim because you have too much control over the villagers and the town. I kind of agree that there is too much control but at the same time I like the design gameplay a lot. I also wish there were more things to do besides that. I think a good compromise could be that you have to do quests for villagers to convince them to put their house where you want it to go. If someone wants to move, maybe you have to do a quest for them if you want to convince them to stay. Maybe the ability to terraform is given for an acre block at a time as villagers collectively decide they want you to do some landscaping in different parts of town. In general I wish there were more quests. Hide and seek from the old games seems fun, but I'd like to see more in depth quests between villagers kind of similar to Majora's Mask questing. Maybe different personalities could have sets of quests that are common for them or with other personalities, encouraging players to have a diversity of villagers.

More shops in town could also help with questing. Brewster could have a set of quests related to his coffee shop and his life. If they brought back the post office, you could have quests regarding the drama between Pelly, Phyllis, and Pete. Shops could unlock slowly so that quests are spread out over many months. I don't feel like it would be too difficult for Nintendo to implement this. Mostly questing just involves writing the dialogue, locking events behind certain checks, and deciding what the parameters will be to succeed in each step of the quest. If they hired writers to make more unique dialogue they could easily task them with this.

Maybe this is getting away from the gameplay of AC too much, I haven't played the originals so I don't know. But this is what I would like to see in the next game.

I also think NPCs should walk around town at certain times of the day. They could always give the option to ask them to make you a coffee or go to a mystery island. Maybe you could befriend NPCs and only when you are good friends will they do these things for you in their downtime.

This got so long but real quick I'd also like to know where villagers are, plan events that villagers will attend, have a bean crop so I can cook falafel and tofu, have orchids as a flower that grows off of the trees, and be able to pot flowers so I can use them indoors.",1,1745686330.0,AnimalCrossing,1,1.0,False

But im looking into calisthenics as well as kickboxing and rock climbing. Im 22f and looking to make friends as i didnt make a lot of friends at uni due to autism. What are some good clubs that attract young people like me? ive tried awesome walls in stockports but its always either full of kids or children and ive tried BLOK Boxing on a saturday morning but its full of 30y/os.

Im really struggling to make friends here, ive grown up here. I have kept a grand total of one friend from high school, due to being bullied for being autistic. Im not looking for sympathy i just genuinely want to know how i can fix this.

I tried Girlsonthego and girlhood for a long time, but i just felt really judged whenever i went there. Literallyy all the girls were new here and when they asked if i was new and i said no i would always get either funny looks or awkward silence. I also got laughed at for being unemployed at the time (i have a 9-5 grad job now).

Ive tried Bumble friends. Im from stockport but i cant find any people from stockport to match with or similar areas. I also joined a neurodiverse group thinking it would be just a bunch of NDs meeting up for coffee, but instead they were all taking about taking psychedelics, shrooms, ketamine ect as a way to cure their mental health. Im not into that so i left the group chat.

  
Im into painting, running (im doing my first half marathon in May), Calisthenics, Rock climbing. Im quite active. I like going out sometimes maybe like every two weeks.

SP - When discarding a Dora	- This... should be the best time to play this one

SP - Less than 10 tiles remaining	- I don't have that many left to play. I just need one final hope...

SP - Tenpai with Yakuman	- Will the winner this time... be me?

Ron	- Ron. Bulls-eye, I win.

Tsumo	- Tsumo. I'll take this‚Ä¶!

Voice when Obtained	- Nice to meet you, I'm Sakura Matou. Sorry for any inconvenience... Eh? You're happy that I'm here...? Th-thank you...

1st Place Finish	- I did it! I won!

Login Voice - Normal	- Hello. You're playing mahjong today too, right? I don't know if I'll be any good, but could I play with you?

Login Voice - Max Bond	- Welcome back. Um, you've been taking care of me a lot these days, so I was thinking of doing something in return. Is there anything you'd like to eat?

Lobby 1	- I know I might not look it, but I'm actually in the archery club at school... Does Asaha High School have an archery club I could practice with? I wouldn't want my skills to get rusty while I'm here in One Han City.

Lobby 2	- I never dreamed that I'd have regular days just playing mahjong with everyone... It's such a strange feeling.

Lobby 3	- Fuyumi and her big brother get along quite well. Seeing them reminds me that such good sibling relationships are possible. It makes me feel kind of happy...

Lobby 4	- Some day, if I became a ""bad person,"" would you be afraid of me? ...Oh, I see. That was fast. But I'm happy to hear you say that.

Lobby 5	- Hmm... Oh, hello. I'm not busy with anything, I was just doing some research on One Han City cuisine... Well, not ""research"" exactly, I was just curious about how it's different from the food in Fuyuki City... Eh? You'd like to know more? R-Really...? Okay, let me get my notebook!

Lobby 6	- If I can live cherishing the little things and simple memories, that's enough for me. The small moments, like cooking together in the kitchen or sharing a meal with someone special... To me, they're irreplaceable treasures, not just everyday occurrences

Lobby 7	- You're back? I just made some pasta with tomato sauce, give it a try. Eh? Th-This's not what you wanted? Oh, but the priestess at the Mahjong Soul Shrine called and said you've been wanting to eat this but were too shy to ask... Hehe, I see. That's okay. Please tell her that if there's anything she'd like to eat, just let me know next time.

Lobby 8	- ...Sorry, I messed up again... I'll practice a few more times. It's okay, learning to play mahjong is fun. Thanks for being such a good teacher, I'll keep trying my hardest.

Receiving Gift - Normal	- You're giving something this precious... to me? Are you sure...?

Receiving Gift - Preferred	- Thank you! ...If you'd like, why don't you have half, and we can enjoy it together?

Bond	- Between every nightmare... I now have even more memories I want to protect while I'm alive. Is someone like me worthy of such a miracle...? Thank you, PLAYER.

Bond Level Up 1	- Why do I like cooking? Well... I set a goal for myself, and it's to cook together with a certain person I care about. So, I've been working towards that bit by bit... Hehe, that's all there is to it. It's nothing special, really...

Bond Level Up 2	- One time after school, I saw a boy practicing the high jump. He kept failing over and over... As I watched him, I wondered why he didn't just give up... Maybe I've never been a ""good"" girl.

Bond Level Up 3	- I was given this key by the most important person in the world to me. It's the most precious gift I've ever received, and it's also like an amulet to me. Even though we're apart, as long as I'm holding it, I feel like we're at each other's side.

Bond Level Up 4	- I will always cherish the kindness you've shown me, PLAYER.

Bond Level Up 5	- Having someone there to eat the food I cooked and to help me fold the clothes I washed... Days like these are more precious to me than any treasure in the world.

SP - When discarding multiple identical tiles in a row	- Another one... What is this?!

SP - When discarding a Dora	- Ugh, I can't believe I have to give up a Dora!

SP - Less than 10 tiles remaining	- Now's the time to change the strategy!

SP - Tenpai with Yakuman	- Watch closely! This is where it gets exciting!

Tsumo	- Tsumo. Sorry about that.

Voice when Obtained	- I'm Rin Tohsaka, but you can call me whatever you like. I hear One Han City is famous for mahjong competitions, and that everyone must take part. So, the next time we meet, we may be enemies.

1st Place Finish	- My victory! Now, I think I'll just help myself to everything.

Login Voice - Normal	- Yawwwn... Morning... I can skip breakfast. It's not that big of a deal to me. Huh? P-Play mahjong...? Now? I thought it was normally played at night.

Login Voice - Max Bond	- You're looking pretty laid-back for someone about to start a mahjong match... Ugh! Even if you end up losing all your points later, don't expect me to help you out!

Lobby 1	- Phew... That's heavy! I found this ridiculously large fan and heard it belongs to an immortal goddess who's also a boss lady or something. I figured you might know her, so I brought it over. Honestly, what a careless goddess she is to lose something this big.

Lobby 2	- Huh?! I'm reliable? S-Someone actually said that? Ahem, well, true as it may be, being called reliable out of nowhere is a bit startling, you know... Alright, what is it you wanted my help with?

Lobby 3	- Average looking,"" ""unrefined,"" ""could be cuter""...? Who said that...?! Ah, Archer... you'll REGRET this!

Lobby 4	- Jewels are as indispensable to the Tohsakas as scoring sticks are to Jyanshis. And there's another thing they share... they're definitely not cheap!

Lobby 5	- So, Servants can't fight in mahjong matches, which means Masters have to rely on their own skills... But that's fine, I can handle it solo! Even in a real battle, self-defense is a must-have skill for modern Mages. I'll show you my Bajiquan if it comes to that.

Lobby 6	- If you're ever not feeling well, just say so, and then take a good long rest. It's important to look after yourself! Ugh...! You're all like this! Why is everyone around me terrible at taking care of themselves?!

Lobby 7	- Come on, get ready for another crushing defeat at the mahjong table today... Huh? An app? A mahjong app...? We are going to play mahjong on the phone? G-Go to the official website, you say? Hmm... Oh, you'll help me? Well, if you insist. Just so you know, it's not like I'm bad with phones or anything.

Lobby 8	- So... You're a Master too. Hmph, I heard everything. That cat-eared girl is your Servant, right? But what class could she be... Caster? No, scratch that... She's probably not a Berserker either... Ehh, is she a Saber?! ...Huh? She's not a Servant? But she keeps calling you ""Master""... Ahem, m-my apologies, forget I said anything weird.

Receiving Gift - Normal	- These lines are meant for those who can stand on their own... They're definitely not for trying to be cool while giving someone a gift!

Receiving Gift - Preferred	- J-Jewels... It's not like I'm speechless because I'm happy. It's just that accepting this would mean owing you, and then I'd feel bad if I beat you at mahjong later... Anyway, thank you. I'll be sure to have a proper gift ready for you next time.

Bond	- I always drop the ball at the key moments... Even though I handle everyday things just fine. But this time... I didn't mess it up, did I?

Bond Level Up 1	- What a curious feeling... We're obviously meeting for the first time, yet you don't feel like a stranger at all. Um, don't get me wrong ‚Äì I'm not complimenting you... After all, we're competitors right now. I'm just acknowledging your strength as my opponent, that's all.

Bond Level Up 2	- Archer... Where did he run off to?! Hmph! I'm sure even you know what it's like to have a disobedient Servant by now. He gets so careless just because we're in a place that SEEMS peaceful. It's really annoying.

Bond Level Up 3	- Those three people over there... They seem really suspicious. That's right, by the fortune-telling stall. There's a girl with green hair and red panda ears arguing with a rabbit-eared lady, and a red-haired woman with them... What's suspicious about them? Well, they look like they can use Magecraft, with wands and crystal balls. Dressing in such a stereotypical Mage fashion actually makes them even more suspicious.

Bond Level Up 4	- The boss lady at Luck and Fortune told me that if you win the mahjong competition hosted at the Mahjong Soul Shrine, your wish will be granted. It's simple, really. In a competition, all I have to do is aim for victory.

Bond Level Up 5	- Wh-What's with you staring at me out of the blue...? Ugh, stop it already! I-Idiot! You're making me embarrassed, looking at me like that!

Voice when Obtained	- Servant, Saber. I have come in response to your summons. From this moment on, my sword stands with you, and your fate is bound with mine.

1st Place Finish- 	I won this time, but it was a fight where I couldn't let my guard down until the end. If the opportunity comes up, I would welcome another match.

Login Voice - Normal	- You will participate in today's mahjong competition? In that case, please allow me to accompany you.

Login Voice - Max Bond - Shall we play mahjong together, PLAYER? Under your recent tutelage, I've become more accustomed to this form of combat, and I have some ideas I'd like to put to the test in a real mahjong battle. It'd be great if I could show you the fruits of my training!

Lobby 1	- Maintaining daily exercise is critical, especially for a Jyanshi, as your profession requires long, intense periods of sitting at the mahjong table. As such, I will join you in exercising for the sake of your physical health, PLAYER.

Lobby 2	- No, it's not that I've gained any special understanding of mahjong... If you're asking why I've been frequenting Luck and Fortune recently... it's because I made some like-minded friends there. Besides, their soba noodles are excellent...

Lobby 3	 - I've been here for a while now, and I appreciate the help you've given me. Whether it's with mahjong or daily life, I wouldn't have adjusted so quickly on my own. Please let me know if there's anything I can do for you in return.

Lobby 4 - 	The show we saw together today... I was very impressed by the animal tamer. Rather than using threats or intimidation, she was genuinely admired by the animals. It's as if she were the queen of the forest. She must have a kind and strong heart. (Note: This is a Seiyuu joke. The animal tamer character Ciri is also voiced by Kawasumi)

Lobby 5	- Home-cooked meals have a more soothing taste than fine dining... Um, not that I'm saying I want to come over for dinner, it's just an impression I got from seeing so many other people do so. They must like you a lot.

Lobby 6	- Oh, it's... a little stuffed lion. Yes, it's adorable... Eh? I-It looks like me? Um... ""Adorable"" is usually used to describe someone innocent and carefree, not someone like me, but... thank you.

Lobby 7	- I've been working part-time at √âternit√© at the manager's request. Here's a coupon for you. There will be an event in the next few days, and I... I was hoping you could come.

Lobby 8	- PLAYER, thank you for looking after me all this time... Hm, too plain. PLAYER, I'm sincerely grateful for the care you've given me... No, that's too formal and distant... Eh? What?! W-Weren't you asleep? I-I was just... um... I was just thinking of how to express my thanks to you... I just couldn't find the right words... Perhaps I should show my gratitude through actions instead? PLAYER, please tell me what you would like me to do!

Receiving Gift - Normal	- A gift‚Ä¶ for me? Thank you for your thoughtfulness.

Receiving Gift - Preferred	- This is for me? Thank you... It looks wonderful and very tasty. I'll be sure to enjoy it.

Bond	- Oh, is it time to eat already? It's an honor to be able to share another meal with you today, PLAYER. Please, have a seat here. Hmm? Do I ever get bored of eating similar food every day? Not in the least. In fact, I quite enjoy this kind of life. Though sometimes... I wonder if I'm indulging too much in these peaceful days... Eh? Are you reassuring me, PLAYER? You really are a kind-hearted person. That's exactly why I hope we can continue sharing meals and enjoying these moments for a little longer.

Bond Level Up 1	- The relationship between Master and Servant is not simply maintained by Command Spells ‚Äì mutual respect and trust are essential as well. While it seems this world doesn't have a power like Command Spells, in friendships, respect and trust are just as important, wouldn't you agree?

Bond Level Up 2	- I couldn't grasp what you were trying to convey earlier. Relationships between people are always complex, no matter the time or situation. Let's both keep working on our relationship.

Bond Level Up 3	- I have duties I must fulfill. Therefore, I need to return to my original world as soon as possible. However, being summoned to this city cannot be mere coincidence. At the very least, I should find out the reason for it. So, until the details become clear, I will remain here.

Bond Level Up 4	 - If you win the mahjong competition at the Mahjong Soul Shrine, your wish will be granted...? Sounds like quite an extraordinary battle. Are you planning to enter? Don't worry, I'll be right next to you.

Bond Level Up 5 	- Servants rely on their Masters' Magical Energy to remain in the material world. But... this rule doesn't seem to apply in One Han City. This place... is like a beautiful dream that's surreal yet brimming with life. Perhaps one day when I wake up, it will be time for me to leave. In any case, I want you to know... PLAYER, I'm so glad we met.

1st Place Finish	- I am the bone of my sword. So as I pray, unlimited blade works.

Login Voice - Normal	- I had a feeling we'd be meeting soon, but... not quite as soon as this.

Login Voice - Max Bond	- Sigh... Get yourself into trouble again? If you need my help, just say so. After all, I'm quite used to trouble.

Lobby 1	- There seems to be very little Mana in this world. Hmm... An inexperienced Mage might struggle to release Magecraft here. But in mahjong, creating something from nothing was never an option anyway, so that won't be a problem for me.

Lobby 2	- You want my opinion on new clothes? Hmm... The red part of this shirt is fine, but the yellow and blue are a bit garish. I don't like them. Why not try this one that's all red?

Lobby 3	- What does ""Archer"" mean? Exactly what it sounds like... Then why do I use swords? Is there anything strange about an archer who excels with blades?

Lobby 4	- Cooking, laundry, cleaning, mowing... It's not that I'm good at these things, I just don't have any problem doing them. Uh, that admiring look on your face... surely doesn't mean you can't do any of those things?

Lobby 5	- Mahjong, huh... It's not quite as routine as brewing black tea, but I can hold my own. These hawk eyes won't miss any careless discards.

Lobby 6	- Mahjong is truly a fascinating game. There are no Class differences... Oh, to put it in simpler terms, there's no interplay or restriction between hand types. Yet, like in battle, if you're careless, even a powerful big hand can be brought down by a one-Han yaku.

Lobby 7	- Big eaters... They really do exist in every world, don't they? It's not a problem per se, but I wonder if your finances can keep up with the appetites of these two ladies.

Lobby 8	- That girl at √âternit√©, is she the trainee manager? It's not really important, but I'm just wondering... How did she figure out I could brew good coffee just by looking at me? Did I do something in the caf√©, you ask? No, not really. I merely asked about the coffee beans and offered some advice on water temperature while having my coffee...

Receiving Gift - Normal	- Everyone has things they like and dislike, so...

Receiving Gift - Preferred	- I see no reason to refuse it. Thanks.

Bond	- My mahjong skills have improved quite a bit recently, thanks to your patient guidance. Help between friends, huh? Not surprising coming from you. But if we're friends, we should have some kind of ""alliance,"" shouldn't we? We're only temporary partners after all.

Bond Level Up 1	- Mahjong... If I had to say, it does kind of suit me. You don't need to worry about working with others, you just do your own thing. Not missing opponents' discards and seeing through their plays are skills that come easily to an archer.

Bond Level Up 2	- Ideals? ...I just remembered some things I'd rather not think about. Naive ideals combined with insufficient ability to uphold them... It disgusts me no matter when I recall it. Sorry, it's just me talking to myself. I hope I didn't upset you.

Bond Level Up 3	- Curious about how a Servant spends their days? Without orders for recon or combat from our Masters, we dematerialize and remain hidden. Nothing special.

Bond Level Up 4	- Got a moment? Do you know where the highest point in One Han City is? It's nothing to do with a Holy Grail War, but I'd like to get a good view of the city from up high.

Bond Level Up 5	- Oh my, more guests today? I don't mind cooking for you, but I'm not inclined to entertain your mahjong friends as well. My cooking is just for you. That's enough, isn't it?",4,1745686134.0,fatestaynight,0,0.84,False

Here are some of the things we did, along with our reactions:

Monday 4/21 - arrived to MSY from Boston and got a taxi from the airport to our hotel on Canal Street. Our flight arrived a little later than scheduled, but otherwise no problems at the airports, on the flight, the taxi, or checking into the hotel.

Tuesday 4/22 - walk from our hotel to the Cafe Fleur-de-Lis on Camp Street for breakfast. Holy moly was it good, my wife had the Seafood Benedict and I had the Cochon de Lait Benedict, we both absolutely loved them! Paired with their Baileys Latte, and it was the perfect first meal in the city. 

Quick walk from there to get on the #12 bus (the 12 streetcar is currently not operating all the way to Canal St due to road work, so they have a shuttle bus running) to get us closer to the World War II museum. A bit expensive to get in, but the amount of things you see and experience is absolutely massive. We spent at least 2-3 hours and I'm not sure we saw absolutely everything. The place is just huge and I might recommend breaking it up into two separate visits in the same day (which you can do without paying extra, you just cannot come back on another day on the same ticket).

We then got on the #12 streetcar just south of Erato Street and rode it past the universities out to the intersection of St Charles and S Carrollton. Walked over to the Original New Orleans Daiquiri place and we each took one ""to go"" and hopped back on the streetcar eastbound.

We went back to our hotel for a bit and then walked over to the Sazerac House for the free walkthrough and tastings in the distillery. All the samples were very tasty and the facility was really cool to see. Bought some bottles to bring back home with us.

Dinner and drinks and the Jimani at the corner of Chartres and Iberville. Not what I would call special but reaonably-priced food and drinks.

Wednesday 4/23 - walk from our hotel to St. Pat's Irish Coffeehouse for breakfast. When we originally get there at a few minutes past 8am, the place looked deserted, no sign of anybody being there. Which was strange, because it was supposed to open at 8am. We take a quick walk around the block and by the time we get back, they're open. The irish coffee was great (I had hot, my wife had iced), and we each had a blueberry scone which was okay but didn't have much blueberry flavor to it.

We walk back to Canal Street to get on the 49 streetcar to French Market. We first go to the Jazz Museum (pro tip - they have a AAA discount if you are a member) and that was terrific for us, both being musicians. We then walk to the French Market and browse around there for at least an hour or so before getting beignets at Caf√© du Monde. Absolutely see why they get the hype they do, absolutely delicious. We then take a quick walk to the waterfront and admire the huge cargo ships passing back and forth. We then check out the other little shops on Decatur Street before getting back on the 49 streetcar to head back toward our hotel. Dinner at the Hard Rock Caf√© (wouldn't have been my first choice but my wife really wanted to go, and honestly the food wasn't terrible).

Then we went to Mahogany Jazz Hall for a couple hours or so. We had initially wanted to go to Preservation Hall, but all the shows were completely sold out, so we went to Mahogany instead and it was honestly an amazing experience. We each got a couple of drinks and listened to the ""Mahogany All Stars"" and they were phenomenal, all world class musicians. Very glad we went there after seeing recommendations for it on here.

Thursday 4/24 - Take the 48 streetcar westbound for breakfast at Waffle House. We don't have one anywhere near us, so we try to go whenever we're near one. The streetcar was absolutely JAMMED with people going to Jazz Fest (which we didn't get to this time, but we will definitely be back and will try to go next time). After breakfast, we get back on the streetcar to go take a walk around City Park, which was an absolutely beautiful walk. We get back on the 48 to head back to Canal Street, and thankfully it was much less full on the return trip.

We stop back at the hotel for a little bit, then get back on the streetcar to head to the Riverwalk Outlets for a little while until we boarded our cruise on the Creole Queen. After the cruise, we came back and bought a few things, not realizing until afterward that the Sales Tax on everything we bought at Riverwalk was 12%. Yikes... found some decent deals, but I feel like they weren't quite as good once the tax was added. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

We took the 2pm cruise on the Creole Queen and that was excellent, it brought us to the Chalmette Battlefield, where we had just under an hour to explore before getting back on the boat. The cruise was nice and smooth, and the narrator/historian Charles told a very powerful story about Hurricane Katrina. We were very satisfied with the cruise and the buffet lunch was quite good, I'd never had jambalaya before and it was quite tasty, not super spicy like I was fearing it would be. My wife loved the shrimp alfredo.

Friday 4/25 - not a whole lot to say, had to catch a cab outside our hotel at 4am to head back to the airport for a 6am flight, everything was fine. Our cab driver was very talkative and gave us some hard candies to have for the flight (which was very much appreciated).

Some general thoughts:

* Nearly everybody we encountered was very, very friendly and personable. There were a few ""characters"" walking around the French Quarter, but we didn't feel unsafe at all (it seemed as though the police presence was pretty solid).
* The 3-day Jazzy Pass was perfect for us, it more than paid for itself with the number of times we used the streetcar to go various places. Highly recommend, and super easy to use the Le Pass app, just show it to the driver on your way on to the streetcar or bus.
* As I said, both she and I are musicians, and we were highly impressed with all of the musical offerings. Every day at all hours of the day there were soloists and groups of all kinds performing in the streets of the French Quarter, and you could tell these were not amateurs.
* As the song goes, if New York is ""the city that never sleeps"", it appears New Orleans is ""the city that's never sober"". Bar after bar after bar, and SO many choices of nightlife, entertainment, food and drink around every corner. And all of them are full every single night. Just mesmerizing!
* Only once did we encounter a ""guess where we got our shoes"" guy, near the French Market. We just laughed and ignored him, thanks to the tips here.
* The weather was overall nice, hot and humid but not oppressive. It rained more on Thursday than the other days, but not awful.

So thank you, New Orleans, for your warmth (both literally and figuratively) and hospitality! We can't wait to come back.

1k8hb4o,https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/1k8hb4o/ih_tips_taking_your_stimulant_correctly/,IH Tips & Taking Your Stimulant Correctly,"I've posted this in a few comments so I thought I'd share.  This is what I have learned through personal experience and reading.  I am not a doctor.

**TLDR here, I know you're too exhausted to read all of this post.**

‚Ä¢ Have a REGULAR CONSISTENT sleep routine giving yourself at least 8+ hours to sleep.

‚Ä¢ Take your stimulant with WATER.

‚Ä¢ HYDRATE during your morning and throughout the day.

‚Ä¢ Avoid ACIDIC BEVERAGES and CAFFEINE for 1-2 hours after taking your stimulant.

‚Ä¢ If you have to nap try doing so for 20 minutes (yes, set an alarm and you'll probably oversleep anyway.  I have not tried this tip.)

‚Ä¢ Start your day with some protein (granola is an easy one).  If you feel yourself crashing during the day, try to keep some form of protein nearby for easy access.  I like to have apple slices as my snack, I notice fruit/veg helps when I feel especially sick & low energy.

The water, hydrating, and protein were a very big game changer for me the last few months.  I'm not kidding I take a red solo cup, fill it full, then take my pills and chug the rest when I wake up.  Then I try to finish a 16oz water bottle before I have coffee at work (I give myself about 90 minutes in the morning to shower and leave for work).  I suck at drinking water, I go all week without anyway, this helped so much.  Give it a try and see if you notice a difference.


Moving on...

Let's talk about stimulants first.

**Dextroamphetamine increases dopamine and norepinephrine in your brain.**

**Dopamine** acts as a neurotransmitter in the brain, facilitating communication between nerve cells and playing a crucial role in various brain functions like motor control, reward, motivation, and pleasure.

‚Ä¢ Dopamine influences **attention, focus, long-term memory formation.**

‚Ä¢ Low (or irregular) levels of Dopamine can be linked to **ADHD, Depression, & Anxiety.**

**Norepinephrine** acts as a neurotransmitter in the brain, mainly affecting alertness and attention.

‚Ä¢ Norepinephrine helps to regulate blood pressure.

‚Ä¢ Norepinephrine primarily regulates our attention, cognitive function, and stress response.

**Dextroamphetamine works by blocking the re-uptake of these, allowing them to stay active in your brain for longer.**.  (Other stimulants like Adderall work similarly)

Now that we know what our medication is actually doing, we can focus on how it might interact with what else we put in our body.

**What you take with your medication during and after affects absorption.**

I used to take mine with whatever was nearby.  Tea, soda, energy drink, coffee.  I was basically ensuring my body wouldn't properly receive the stimulant.

‚Ä¢ Acidic drinks reduce absorption and make it less effective.  (Ex:  Coffee, Soda, Citrus, Energy Drinks.  Check the ingredients on the can!)

‚Ä¢ Stomach PH, high fat meals, other medications and medical conditions can affect all of this.  Do some reading.

**Take your medication with water.  Hydrate as much as possible early after waking up.  Avoid the usual coffee and energy drinks for 1-2 hours after your medication.**

I'm honestly too tired now to finish this & discuss SSRI vs SNRI lol.  I'll possibly edit this later but I describe the difference in another comment if you check my post history.

I hope this can help some of you because my doctor didn't tell my caffeinated ass I was part of the reason the medication wasn't working.  If anyone else wants to add some other IH tips in the comments and people find this helpful I'll try to edit them in the post.",9,1745685892.0,idiopathichypersomnia,1,1.0,False
1k8hamr,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1k8hamr/does_the_keurig_kmini_coffee_maker_truly_deliver/,Does the Keurig K-Mini Coffee Maker Truly Deliver Convenience? In-Depth Review,"Keurig 5000367898 has found its way into my daily routine, transforming the way I enjoy coffee each morning. As someone who thrives on caffeine, the sleek and compact design caught my eye the moment I saw it. It's hard to believe a coffee maker this slim (less than 5 inches wide) could pack so much convenience. The matte finish in Evergreen elevates it from just another kitchen gadget to something that genuinely complements my decor. With a brewing capacity ranging from 6-12oz, the machine accommodates both my lighter morning cup and my stronger, mid-afternoon boost. 

**Ease of Use**  
Using this device is almost effortless. I don't have much patience for complicated appliances before my first cup of coffee, and the Keurig nails simplicity. A single reservoir requires fresh water for each cup, ensuring you're always using clean water for brewing. It‚Äôs simply a matter of filling the reservoir, popping in a pod, pressing a button, and voil√†‚Äîhot coffee. Fast brewing is definitely a highlight; I‚Äôm talking about a piping cup of coffee in just a few minutes. There‚Äôs no fiddling with settings or extra controls; it focuses solely on simple, quick operation.

**Favorable Aspects**  
- Compact design makes it perfect for small spaces like apartments, offices, and dorm rooms.  
- Cord storage keeps my countertop tidy and helps when transporting the device between my home and the office.  
- Energy-efficient auto-off feature conserves power by shutting down 90 seconds after the last brew.  
- Compatible with reusable K-Cup filters, allowing for eco-friendly coffee brewing.  

[Check Keurig 5000367898 price on Amazon.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b09rq568fd/)  

**Performance and Coffee Quality**  
The most critical aspect of any coffee machine is, of course, the coffee itself. This brewer consistently surprised me. While it's marketed as a single-serve brewer, each cup is fresh, flavorful, and piping hot. The ability to choose between various K-Cup pods gives variety to my coffee options without overwhelming complexity. And if you prefer customizing your coffee, this machine accommodates reusable K-Cup filters for brewing your ground coffee, which I utilized on ‚Äúspecial coffee days.‚Äù However, I didn‚Äôt notice any significant flavor difference between pods and grounds.

**Design and Modern Style**  
Design has always been a crucial factor for me when buying kitchen gadgets. This coffee maker‚Äôs slim profile and modern style fit conveniently anywhere in my small kitchen, even in a tight corner. The matte finish avoids the glossy ‚Äúplastic look,‚Äù giving it a premium edge. Additionally, the removable drip tray is an excellent feature for tall travel mugs, which fits perfectly when I‚Äôm prepping my to-go brew. Cleanup was easy since the tray can hold accidental spills, though I thankfully didn‚Äôt experience too many.

**Shortcomings**  
- The single water reservoir means you‚Äôll need to refill it before each use. While hygienic, it does add an extra step.  
- Some larger coffee mugs might not fit, even with the adjustable drip tray removed.  
- It gets a little noisy at times when brewing, nothing too bothersome, but it‚Äôs there.  

**Energy Efficiency and Eco-Friendliness**  
As someone conscious about energy usage, I appreciate the automatic shut-off feature. It's a thoughtful addition that doesn‚Äôt sacrifice convenience for energy savings. I also love that it supports reusable filters, reducing waste from disposable pods. For households dedicated to eco-friendly practices, this possibility makes it a sustainable choice without compromising its output. 

**Market Rivals**  
Comparing this model to competitors like the Nespresso Essenza Mini, one easily notices distinct differences. Nespresso excels in offering robust espresso shots, whereas the Keurig balances affordability, portability, and ease of use. Meanwhile, competing brands like the Hamilton Beach Single Serve FlexBrew offer compatibility with both grounds and pods but lack Keurig‚Äôs level of compactness or visual appeal. Simply put, this machine shines in the small space and simple-use category, although heavy coffee drinkers wanting large reservoirs might prefer alternatives.

**Value Proposition**  
While there are more expensive and feature-filled coffee makers out there, this one stands out for its cost-efficiency. If you‚Äôre seeking an affordable but high-quality single-serve brewer, the features packed into this little unit match its price point effectively. Between the portability and modern design, you genuinely feel like you‚Äôre getting a well-rounded product for its cost.

1k8h5vn,https://www.reddit.com/r/nespresso/comments/1k8h5vn/moccamaster_user_considering_a_citiz_platinum/,Moccamaster user considering a CitiZ Platinum,"I‚Äôve been using a Moccamaster paired with a Fellow Ode grinder for a few years.  Works great, but, I‚Äôll be honest, I‚Äôm tired of weighing and grinding coffee, filters, etc.    Grinders are also messy (yes, even the Ode2, It‚Äôs less messy than my original Ode grinder, but still makes a mess over time).  

  
Seriously thinking about making the switch to pods for convenience and less mess and I like the original Nespresso (we have a machine in the office on the occasions that I go in).   The CitiZ platinum also gives the option of using water for my wife‚Äôs green tea and making Americano‚Äôs as well.  Seems to be the best of both worlds.

  
I don think I want the Vertuo line makers as I understand the OL gives you a more ‚Äùtraditional‚Äù type espresso.  I don‚Äôt really care about the fancy flavors, etc., just want a cup of coffee, whether it is espresso or an Americano.   

  
Downsides seem to be the cost of pods (I typically drink 2 cups/day) compared to the cost of beans (which I usually get in bulk from Costco).

In my ideal world, I would get rid of the Moccamaster and grinder and replace with Nespresso.  Though another option I‚Äôm considering is using the Moccamaster with pre-ground coffee, getting rid of the grinder and having both Moccamaster and Nespresso machine.  

Couple questions for you all:

1) Is there a difference between the CitiZ platinum version Nespresso sells vs the version that is at Williams-Sonoma?   
2) Any other potential downsides that I am missing

3) Anyone else make this switch?  Am I crazy?

I was anxious about going because I have an invisible disability (PTSD) which is really acting up at the moment and the crowd at the start can be overwhelming. Still, I plucked up the courage. It was a great opportunity to meet some of the volunteers as I haven't yet volunteered at this particular Parkrun. Also, I am a trans woman, the UK Supreme Court ruling which has really impacted trans people here has been a big part of my anxiety, so I wanted to just show myself I'm still welcome and that it is going to be ok.

I cheered on the runners, and had a lovely conversation with the tail walkers! One of them invited me along to the club house nearby where there is food and coffee after the run. I was tempted to decline -- there was a nearby coffee shop where they have a single unisex toilet as I needed to go and bathrooms have become a big thing for trans people in the UK now. But, again I wanted to show myself it's okay.

So I did what I've been told and instead of asking for the ladies toilets, I asked where the disabled toilet was. The volunteer didn't think there was one. So... he suggested that I could use the men's and here's the kicker: he would check there was no one in there and he would watch the door.

He meant well but it just threw me. I am not a man and honestly it's very rare now for anyone to treat me like one. I mean, I guess he knew that in some way otherwise he wouldn't have offered to protect me going in there. Well, after some fuss one of the other runners pointed out where the disabled toilet was. Right next to the women's toilet where I am now expected not to go. I was reeling. I felt like an oddity.

Being trans isn't a mental illness, but gender dysphoria is a medical condition and it can really impact your mental health and this sense that I am now excluded in so many ways is really weighing on me. The dysphoria, the PTSD, it all went into overdrive and I started to lose my sense of where I was which is when I know it's really bad. I looked at the crowd of volunteers who I was hoping to meet and just wanted to cry. So I left.

I am exhausted. Parkwalk was my chance to show myself life could be normal but I just feel more othered than ever. I don't know if I'll feel OK volunteering there now and I wish I hadn't been honest about being trans at all. And I don't want to be one of those runners who never volunteer. I am not selfish.

I was thinking about it from a day to day perspective. 

1) you venture outside, people are not staring at their phones. There is more of an aire of openness and willingless to interact. this could extend to third spaces such as coffee shops, grocery stores, bars. 

2) when you do chat with someone of the opposite sex, you know that you are not competing with the myriad of options on their dating profiles / social media. 

Imagine it's a normal saturday. you wake up, clean up and head outside to a coffee shop. as you enter, you notice it's a social environment. people are present, looking at their environment, observing others. some are just chilling reading a book. as you get a coffee, you have an easy conversation with someone next to you in line. when you sit down, you ask what book the a women is reading and you chat about it for 5 minutes. there are no headphones, no faces in phones. Youve been to this shop several times and have gotten to know a few of the patrons.

As you head to the grocery store, someone asks you what you are making - noticing the ingredients you are putting in your basket. as you walk around, you make eye contact with people - and notice a cute guy/girl and smile. people aren't avoiding others, buried in phones/headphones. 

it's time to head out to the bar with your guys/girls. finally - you can look your best - maybe you'll meet someone cute that catches your eye! after all, you love meeting people in public and interacting. this is kinda where it happens. you enter the bar and notice tons of chatter / people being present / open  and socializing with each other. You chat with a pretty girl for awhile, and she seems exicted - you finally exchange numbers. she mentions how exciting it was to meet you - she hadn't been asked out in over a month by anyone. This is opposed to going out, seeing people on their phones. when you ask out a girl/guy - you know she probably has 2-3 dates that week with other people she met on social media. when you talk to her, she is judging you against the 100 people she swiped on her online dating profile and 50 DMS versus just you. 

I lived in this era in the 2000's - is there any way we can bring this back?

Starting April 17th, I've been experiencing upper middle/left abdominal pain (feels like a mix of burning/stabbing), nausea, bloating, sometimes chills when I eat most foods and today experienced sudden dizziness while seated. My bm's have been normal, no difficulty swallowing, my stomach doesn't hurt when empty. My c-section incision looks good.

After 2 days eating normally and experiencing pain, I decided to go on the BRAT diet and have since started adding bland foods to try and feed myself (I'm also breastfeeding).  I don't experience discomfort when I stick to those bland items that I've tested (chicken breast, butter, toast, light peanut butter, chicken and beef broth, cheerios, saltines, lactose free milk, lactose free fruit yogurt, rice, steamed carrots). Since eating this way I have lost 5 lbs.

Things that cause pain: Apples, broccoli, coffee, eggs, avocados (probably other things but I've avoided everything because the pain lasts several hours)

I started 20mg omeprazole on the 19th and take it twice a day, haven't noticed a difference.

My bloodwork showed auto wbc 11.2 (deemed 'high' according to the range), platelets 422 (deemed 'high' according to the range), and Eosinophils Absolute 3.1 (very high according to range). Everything else is within normal range.

Your child shows remarkably progressive development to the point where the word genius is getting tossed around casually. Intellectually speaking, they are above and beyond but other behavior seems to not be on track. You notice this and ask for advice from everyone from other parents to medical professionals. There is some advice for teaching things like empathy, reading emotions, and and being emotionally available to the child yourself and you follow it.

The child grows to toddler and adolescence and the problems only become more stark and glaring. You can see how the child is able to read and manipulate the emotions and viewpoints of unsuspecting people around, and you also see how behind closed doors the child seems fascinated with violence and seems to treat boundaries like a game. You never see it happen, but you have found mutilated animals left nearby before and seen freshly cleaned tools slightly out of place. Sometimes the way the child stares at you makes the hair on your neck stand up. You again ask for advice and help and there are tests that come back with some disorders but everyone attributes it to the ""genius"" situation. Therapy is described and you make sure the child goes, while continuing to try the initial teachings you were advised from when the child was very young.


The child becomes a preteen and has switched therapists a few times, some think the child is making excellent progress and start scheduling less therapy, some can tell the child is trying to lie and manipulate them and don't want to spend time on someone unwilling to do the work or take it seriously, and others claim they are unqualified or too inexperienced to work on a case like theirs. 

The child has become increasingly frustrated at home and gets violent with/around you. Throwing things, approaching with knife in hand, threatening to harm you, breaking things, messing with electrical components or other dangerous traps, and so on. You try to report him to the police but they don't take the ""outbursts of a teenager"" seriously, even when you're bleeding a little. They will not arrest the child. You try forcing them into psychiatric confinement, but they always release the child with no further diagnoses or help not long after. You try talking to psychiatrists with the recommendations of previous therapists and psychologists to get medication which happens but the child always finds new and creative ways not to take the pills and gets rid of them covertly. With each attempt the child grows more and more overtly threatening toward you and you keep narrowly avoiding terrible accidents- gas pedal locking at the floor because the spring meant to pop it back up suddenly broke, refrigerator nearly falling in you, feeling dizzy while driving after morning coffee, etc.

1k8gwys,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k8gwys,Nespresso Expert machine noises,"  
Greetings fellow Reddit users,

I would like to share my experience with the Expert Machine - perhaps some of you will find it useful:

After more than seven years of flawless operation (used daily) the machine started making hissing and gurgling noises when it‚Äôs turned on and idling. A little steam coming out of the loading bay when it‚Äôs open, too - but that‚Äôs pretty much it, no coffee going straight into tray, etc.

I‚Äôve seen a few archived posts about same issue - so I decided to do a little DIY project to find out the cause. I actually thought the culprit was the small rubber O-ring put between the thermoblock and brewing unit. I bought the OEM part (Krups p/n MS-623318, if anyone is interested) and replaced it, following the factory service manual.

After putting everything back together and testing, I unfortunately have to admit that the sound and steam are still there, so the reason is obviously not the old O-ring: it was already a bit square-ish after years of use, but it wasn‚Äôt leaking.

Now I think Expert machine users notice this phenomenon because its (and U‚Äôs, I believe) default brewing unit position is open, not closed like in other models - so any steam coming out of the thermoblock can be heard and seen. Using logic, that means there must be some sort of cutoff or one-way valve of some kind before the thermoblock that started passing a bit of water when idling.

I will look closer into it, maybe try changing the water pump and see what happens. Funny thing is, if I open the loading bay of my old Pixie machine when it‚Äôs on, it also has steam coming out of the brewing unit )

Thanks for reading, any thoughts from fellow Expert owners is much appreciated!

So I have this friend, simula bata pa lang magkaibigan na kami. Lagi na kaming magkasama kahit saan. Magkaramay kami sa lahat ng mga pinagdaanan at mga naging kalokohan namin sa buhay growing up, yung struggle ng adulting stage, sa work, relationships, family, etc. Yung tipong pag may mga pupuntahan kaming gala noong bata pa kami, siya ung tatanungin sakin ng parents ko kung kasama rin ba siya para payagan ako.

So for me, bata pa lang kami, I consider this friend as my best friend na. Kaya naman nung kinasal ako years ago na, siya yung ginawa kong MOH. Kasi wala na rin naman akong ibang maisip na pwede kasi parang siya lang ung kino-consider ko as my close friend.

Ang kinakalungkot ko lang, nung kinasal siya, sa dami niyang ginawang abay (more than 10), hindi man lang niya ako naisip kunin na abay, hindi rin niya ako sinabihan. Kasi di ba when you choose your wedding squad, aside sa siblings and relatives, you also choose from your closest friends.

Nung tinitingnan ko yung mga abay niya aside sa mga siblings and relatives, mostly ung mga naging friends niya nung college at recently dahil sa work.

I felt like wala akong kwentang kaibigan. Parang ako lang pala ung nagcoconsider na close friends or mag best friend kami. I don't know kung okay lang ba tong nararamdaman ko but I just felt sad. May kurot sa dibdib ko yung friendship status namin.

Hindi ko pinapaalam sa family ko na ikinasal na siya kasi hindi ko alam pano sasagutin yung reactions at questions nila sakin kasi alam nila na close friend kami simula bata pa at siya ung ginawa kong MOH noong ako ang ikinasal kami. Malamang sa malamang, tatanungin nila ako bakit hindi ako kasama sa mga abay niya.

I'm not saying na gawin din niya akong MOH, ang sakin lang, bakit di ako nakapasok sa standard niya as abay sa kasal? I'm feeling heartbroken kasi wala man lang invitation na maging abay or something like tatanungin kung okay lang ba gawin akong abay. Something ganon ba. I don't know, wala naman kaming naging conflict ever.

Alam mo ung feeling ng mga bata pa, nagde-daydream kayo na ikakasal. Tapos syempre, as close friends mapapag usapan niyo na magiging abay niyo yung isat isa. Ganon kasi ung feeling ko eh. Ang funny at weird nga, kasi sakin siya nagcoconsult ng mga needs at concerns nila sa wedding prep. Hehe. Pero willing to help naman ako.

There are moments rin na nagseselos ako kapag iniinvite ko siya to have quick catch up and coffee. May times na nagdedecline siya, busy sa work, OT sa work, etc. Tapos bigla ko makikita sa fb n kasama niya mga new friends niya.

I was hurt lang din talaga kasi simula't sapul, siya lang ung unang pumapasok sa isip ko na kinoconsider ko as best friend. Pero sakin lang pala un, hindi pala mutual ung feeling. 

But I understand her, may pagka parehas kami ng personality. Introvert at medyo weak to handle confrontations, kaya siguro di niya ako masabihan.

Pero ayun nga, wala na rin naman akong magagawa. Im just praying to God na i-comfort niya ako and tanggalin niya tong mga nararamdaman ko. Ayoko rin kasing masira ang relationship namin as friends.

I lost interest intermittently but leaned back later the same year. Moka pot happened, then the press and the drip systems. Then came the good-natured, ever forgiving budget Chinese espresso machine with pressurised portafilters. 

Been over 6 years and the love has grown stronger. At the start of the year, felt like I was ready for the speciality experience and committed to a major upgrade. And here I am feeling blissed out with just about the right dial in for this first naked pull.

i was hired with 2 rings in my right nostril and i was told i would have to remove at least one of them if i wanted to keep working there. 

i had so many goals and plans within this company; i wanted to move up, be a coffee master. 

i genuinely love(d) working here and for my store. this has been one of the hardest decisions ive made so far and i have been agonising about it since the new dress code was announced. 

but at the end of the day no matter how much i think about it or what i try and convince myself-i am not willing to risk losing my jewellery over a job and im also not willing to give up the last ounce of self expression that i had. 

i was always in dress code, did everything to standards, created a family with the partners at my store. and now i have to leave because of a nose ring. 

i dont want to leave, and truly there hasn‚Äôt been a day since my meeting where i didnt spend most of it sobbing.

Starting April 17th, I've been experiencing upper middle/left abdominal pain (feels like a mix of burning/stabbing), nausea, bloating, sometimes chills when I eat most foods and today experienced sudden dizziness while seated. My bm's have been normal, no difficulty swallowing, my stomach doesn't hurt when empty. My c-section incision looks good.

After 2 days eating normally and experiencing pain, I decided to go on the BRAT diet and have since started adding bland foods to try and feed myself (I'm also breastfeeding).  I don't experience discomfort when I stick to those bland items that I've tested (chicken breast, butter, toast, light peanut butter, chicken and beef broth, cheerios, saltines, lactose free milk, lactose free fruit yogurt, rice, steamed carrots). Since eating this way I have lost 5 lbs.

Things that cause pain: Apples, broccoli, coffee, eggs, avocados (probably other things but I've avoided everything because the pain lasts several hours)

I started 20mg omeprazole on the 19th and take it twice a day, haven't noticed a difference.

My bloodwork showed auto wbc 11.2 (deemed 'high' according to the range), platelets 422 (deemed 'high' according to the range), and Eosinophils Absolute 3.1 (very high according to range). Everything else is within normal range.

 One of the workers is a very sweet guy and friendly with everyone, I think he‚Äôs younger than me and it seems that he owns the place, last week I decided to take off my mask and my jacket, however he kneeled near my chair so I can look straight at him and asked me if everything is okay, I was terrified tbh and I nod my head then he left the place, and I can feel him looking at me from the outside but I didn‚Äôt care I was busy, and when I was about to leave he asked me again the same question. 


Next time I saw him when he was about to take my order, we both were nervous and I asked him few questions about the public transport, he explained everything to me politely, and then he asked me to download the app because I‚Äôm a loyal customer lol. 


However he didn‚Äôt mention that to the other customer he didn‚Äôt even look at her. 


I don‚Äôt know anything about him except his name, and it seems that he‚Äôs a medical student but he‚Äôs not in my university, based on his behaviors and attitude I‚Äôm sure I typed him correctly.


I‚Äôm confused, what should I do? And what was his intention? I love this shop it‚Äôs my favorite place but the situation between us awkward lol

1k8gqeb,https://www.reddit.com/r/yvughdhfjfj/comments/1k8gqeb/dolores_cortez/,Dolores Cortez,"DOLORES CORTEZ ‚Äì Character Profile (Finalized)

Full Name: Dolores Cortez Age: 18 Species: Mexican human-wolf hybrid Gender: Female Sexual Orientation: Lesbian Nationality: Mexican (currently living in Japan) Relationship Status: Married to Monika (wears her wedding ring on her middle finger) Occupation: Fashion designer, seamstress, plush-maker


---

Appearance & Identity

Dolores is tall, sultry, and visually striking, with flowing snow-white hair, intense crimson eyes, and an alluring figure that draws attention the moment she enters a room. A Mexican human-wolf hybrid, she boasts a long, fluffy tail, pointed wolf ears, and a predatory grace that hints at her wild nature. Her skin is a warm, soft orange‚Äîdistinctly bronzed, neither pale nor dark‚Äîgiving her a unique, sun-kissed appearance.

Her figure is lean, with pronounced curves‚Äîespecially her naturally large breasts. She takes careful pride in maintaining her body, not out of vanity, but to always be worthy of Monika‚Äôs love and focus.

Around her neck is a sleek black collar with a dangling iron plate that reads ‚ÄúMonika‚Äôs Possession.‚Äù Underneath the text is a small engraved heart with the initials ‚ÄúD, M.‚Äù She also bears a tattoo across her upper back that reads ‚ÄúMonika Cortez‚Äù in a flowing script‚Äîhalf emerald green, half crimson red‚Äîaccented with wolf paw prints and a tiny bowtie symbol beneath the final letter.

Dolores makes all her own clothing. She refuses to wear anything mass-produced, instead opting for seductive, form-fitting designs made to Monika‚Äôs exact tastes. Her clothes are always meant to get Monika's attention.


---

Personality & Behavior

Dolores is obsessive, emotional, and deeply affectionate. Her entire emotional world orbits around Monika. She doesn‚Äôt just love Monika‚Äîshe craves her, and any second without her affection feels like a second not living. Though she‚Äôs flirtatious and forward, her confidence hides intense vulnerability. If Monika even talks intimately with someone else, Dolores becomes instantly pouty or jealous.

She‚Äôs highly flustered by Monika‚Äôs teasing and loves being called names like ""mi princesa espa√±ola,"" ""puppy,"" or ""good girl""‚Äîbut only when it‚Äôs from Monika. If anyone else tries, they‚Äôre met with a glare, growl, or slap. Dolores thrives on being pampered, carried, cuddled, and especially enjoys being scooped into Monika‚Äôs lap.

A strange but consistent comfort behavior: Dolores frequently buries her face in Monika‚Äôs breasts‚Äîwhen she‚Äôs upset, tired, relaxed, or just flustered. She finds it soothing like a warm personal pillow and makes no apologies for it. Monika finds it adorable.

Despite her seductive looks and thin frame, Dolores is no pushover. She‚Äôs fiercely protective and won‚Äôt hesitate to claw or punch someone for crossing a line. Her hybrid claws are sharp and lethal, and unlike her brother Alejandro, she has no qualms about using them to protect those she loves.

The idea of leashes or being treated like a pet


---

Relationships

Monika: Her wife, her obsession, her everything. Dolores lives for Monika‚Äôs affection and sees herself as her equal, partner, and possession.

Alejandro Cortez: Her older brother, protective and loving. They have a loyal sibling bond despite being very different.

Sayori: Sister-in-law. Their dynamic is neutral but kind.

Rose Cortez: Her adorable niece. Dolores spoils her with handmade plushies and custom clothes.

Literature Club Girls: Mixed feelings, but has made plushies of each girl as birthday gifts.

MC: Absolute mutual hatred. Dolores despises him for his old feelings for Monika, and he‚Äôs terrified of her. He's technically the ex-boyfriend of both Monika and Dolores‚Äîchildhood sweetheart of one, brief adult relationship of the other.

This has been going on for about a year now with me and a supervisor from another department. It started with him having his arm around me while helping me with something on the computer. He was very close, maybe even touching. Ever since then it‚Äôs been few words, awkward glances from one another mixed with locked eye contact, and me, even catching him looking at my breasts and maybe my butt.

Recently, our business is entering our busy season and he got a little frustrated with me about a request that our boss made. He later came back and apologize. I told him it was OK and that I‚Äôm here to help whenever he needed help, extending the olive branch. He took me up on his offer and I came to work in his department for a week or so we got to chat a little and he bought me a coffee, but things fizzled out with me returning to my department and helping in other departments.

There was a day or two of not really seeing him and then the other day, I was on lunch, staring out the door at the pouring rain, trying to figure out how to best get to my car and he startled me, saying, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not gonna melt,‚Äù and proceeded to tap my arm once with the back of his hand like in a friend type gesture, and tell me that I could go out the side door near his desk, which was next to my car. I told him thank you and ran off.

I am extremely shy when it comes to him, and I sense a bit of awkwardness from him too, but the close contact and him actually feeling comfortable with tapping me on the arm has got me thinking that maybe he‚Äôs into me too. In a non-work situation I would have just asked him, but because of that, I am very cautious.

When I broke up with him, 3 months ago, he said he needs time to think and appreciate what we both lost, and that we could be distant friends and ""who knows"" what could happen in the future. Unfortunately my ego was so big, I left him on read and I didn't reach out again, until we met randomly at an event, 1 month ago. He proposed to meet for a coffee to talk.

During this meeting he said that we are done and that I should not think about him anymore, that I'm an amazing girl but that our communication never worked and he remembers me being disappointed and sad most of the time. Again, my ego stepped in and I didn't react emotionally or even ask for him back. I made jokes about our breakup and I didn't say anything about getting back together. I just said I miss our time together, and then I gracefully left & continued no contact.

I regret every second of this. Since we met I have been reading a lot about avoidants, attachment in general, communication strategies, potential narcissistic tendencies, etc. I've decided that he is the man i want, with all his faults and avoidance and lack of accountability, and I want to let him know I'm up to reconnecting.

His birthday will be in 3 months, and I was thinking to text him a birthday wish and then shoot my shot again. 

Is 4 months of NC enough for an avoidant to miss their dumper ex? Or is his ego bruised indefinitely?
When I contact him, should I let him know directly through texting about my feelings and wish to try again? Or should I ask him to meet for a drink and tell him face to face? Since he is a dismissive avoidant, he gets extremely uncomfortable talking about feelings face to face. 

How to proceed?

An important mention: please do not recommend me therapy, moving on or other options. I'm only interested in pursuing him going forward, and I'm only asking for advice towards that goal.

(Note: This problem of my is exclusive to studying activity, so I doubt I have ADHD nor I have been diagnosed)  
  
Context:

* Sleep is decent (6‚Äì10 hrs daily)
* I exercise regularly (3-5x a week, 2-3 hrs per session, sports centric + conditioning)
* Eating properly (mild calorie deficit)
* Managing stress to avoid stress eating (acads is more of a stressor)
* Post-workout: taking creatine + whey protein

* Memo Plus Gold (Bacopa Monnieri) ‚Äî local brand
* Fish Oil ‚Äî I used to take this way back, just stopped for a few months but planning to reintegrate now
* Creatine ‚Äî already part of my post-workout stack
* Others such as Citicoline/Cognizin, L-Tyrosine, Caffeine + L-Theanine (tho I drink coffee and tea a lot), the reason of the query here in the sub-reddit.

Also looked into:

* Gingko Biloba ‚Äî but many say it's placebo
* Glutapos ‚Äî seems sketchy or ineffective based on what I read

Questions:

1. Any comments on the stack above?
2. Are there better alternatives you recommend for long-term focus, attention, and studying?
