SCNN droned on in the background about the crime wave and I only got more irritated. I felt a snap and looked down in surprise. I’d snapped the handle right off of one of my favorite coffee mugs. An old thing that had a diagram of the Enterprise-D from *Star Trek: The Next Generation*.

That was my second favorite Enterprise behind the Constitution Refit which should be rightly at the top of anyone’s list of the best starships Enterprise. Seeing the Enterprise-D return to life at the end of *Picard* had me crying like a baby.

Accidentally breaking my mug only put me in an even more foul mood as I thought about the city getting its collective panties in a twist over a bunch of petty crime. Petty crime!

“This shit doesn’t even seem like much of a crime wave to me! Some bank robberies, a few muggings in the dodgy part of town. Basically the kind of crime that would’ve been unremarkable in any normal city,” I said. “And there are parts of town down near the dock where getting mugged is practically the only economic activity!”

Fialux nodded. I could tell from her smile that this was amusing her, but she was also trying her best to be understanding. I guess I’d have to take it.

“Let it all out,” she said.

“I’ve looked up the statistics for the “crime wave” SCNN is up in arms about, and the numbers are still a hell of a lot better than other comparable cities like New York, Chicago, or LA,” I said. “And don’t even get me started on how they’re massaging the statistics. Per capita there are lots of podunk cow towns in the flyover states that have far worse crime and murder rates!”

“Have you ever thought that maybe it’s just that they’ve spent so much time covering the kind of crime you used to get up to that they don’t know how to cover regular crime?”

“That sure as hell seems to be what’s going on,” I growled. “They’re treating every petty bank robber or kid who steals a candy bar like they’re the next huge villain to hit the city.”

“That sounds about right,” Fialux said. “News everywhere lives by ‘if it bleeds, it leads.’ I should know. I’m about to graduate with a journalism degree.”

“Yeah, that mixed in with a touch of Starlight City’s news agencies getting so used to living under the benevolent umbrella of me being the ultimate crime boss in the city means when I suddenly disappear they go crazy making mountains out of a few molehills,” I grumbled. “All because they’d rather chase ratings than do their jobs responsibly.”

“And you don’t like them making mountains out of those molehills?” she asked, seeming genuine for the first time since this conversation started. “Why wouldn’t you be happy? If they’re making mountains out of molehills it means there aren’t any mountains that are about to smack down on the city.”

I opened my mouth. I was on the verge of telling her that the big problem was I wanted to be the mountain knocking down those molehills, but I stopped myself. She really didn’t like it when I referred to my former career, and I didn’t want to start an argument.

Even if it did frustrate me to see a bunch of D-list criminal scum getting all the attention in the news. That should’ve been me out there getting A-list criminal scum coverage, damn it.

I blamed myself. I’d been busy canoodling with my girlfriend who was only truly happy if I was on the straight and narrow. Then I’d been busy trying to make my girlfriend feel better about losing the superpowers that allowed her to make her own not insignificant contribution to the city’s crime statistics. 

“It’s like we take a little vacation to fight off a legitimate supervillainess moving in on my territory and suddenly a few weeks not operating under my benevolent villainous protection is enough to make everyone decide Night Terror and Fialux are gone for good,” I said.

Fialux snorted. I looked up and realized, too late, that maybe that wasn’t the best way to phrase that. Not when there was a chance that Fialux, or at least the Fialux who’d won over Starlight City, might be gone for good.

“It could be worse,” I said, trying to change the subject. “The lesser criminals might know I’m still out here, but maybe they think I’ve gone good or something because I keep saving the city instead of trying to take it over like I used to.”

“And that’s a good thing that you keep saving the city,” Fialux said. “I know it’s a difficult transition, but you know it feels right.”

I looked up at her and forced a smile. I’d thought it felt right when we defeated CORVAC the first time around. Feeling the city cheering for me had been wonderful, but the problem was the more time went on the more I felt like all this hero business wasn’t for me.

Dr. Lana was a good example. I should’ve vaporized that bitch the first time I saw her about to cause trouble. I hadn’t, and look where it got Fialux.

“Besides, I don’t think the petty criminals in this city are going on crime sprees because they think you’ve suddenly turned good,” Fialux said.

I arched an eyebrow. “You don’t?”

She snorted. “You were a terror to them when you were a villain. Breathing your name was enough to keep them under control. Why the hell would they be out there trying to muscle in on your territory if they thought you’d gone good?”

“Which, by logical extension, means I’d be trying to stop them with the full force of the powers they’d been so terrified of when I was bad?” I asked.

“Exactly.”

“Yeah, the only problem with that is petty criminals aren’t exactly known for their great critical thinking abilities. It’s a big part of the reason why they turn to petty crime in the first place,” I said. “It was a nice idea, though.”

Plus I figured there was something else at work. Something far nicer and far more sinister at the same time.

Maybe they figured if I’d gone good then I’d caught a case of conscience. It happened to villains, but it hadn’t happened to me. I wasn’t any less likely to vaporize someone for muscling in on my territory now that I’d saved the city a couple of times than I was when I was in the business of bending the city to my will and running things from behind the scenes.

The only problem was the person I kept trying to kill this time around happened to be the only person I’d ever run up against who could survive the many forms of death I kept throwing at her.

“What about you?” she asked.

“What about me?”

“You’re a genius. Like Jeopardy smart, and you went into a life of crime,” she said.

I snorted. “There’s a difference between a life of petty crime and trying to take over the world darling.”

“Yeah? Seems to me it’s just a matter of scale,” she said.

“Hardly,” I said. “I decided to go into a life of crime because I was tired of living by society’s rules. I figured only the strong survived, it was survival of the fittest out there, and the little tech toys I created for myself meant I was the fittest of them all.”

Fialux leaned forward. There was a gleam to her eyes that I liked. A gleam she got when I started monologuing, for all that she got pissy when I started putting the theory in my monologues into practice in the real world.

“Go on,” she said. 

“I figure anyone who tried to get in my way was either going to have a bad day or potentially get vaporized,” I said.

Her mouth opened just a bit. Weird how she could get all hot and bothered thinking about me being villainous while getting annoyed when I actually acted villainous out in the field. Which might be a problem if we ran into that new hero. Especially if it turned out she wasn’t who I suspected.

“Seems like getting vaporized would be a bad day,” she said.

I shrugged. “Probably is a bad day, but at least it’s a bad day that isn’t going to last longer than it takes for someone’s body to be ripped apart at the atomic level. My vaporizers work really fast on people.”

“Right. So I still don’t see how what you do is any better than what petty criminals do,” she said. “You’re like a politician or something. You just do it on a big enough scale that it ceases to be a crime.”

“I do it on a big enough scale that no one can do anything about it being a crime,” I said. “Slight difference.”

Fialux rolled her eyes to let me know exactly what she thought of that. No surprises there though. I didn’t think she was ever going to give up on her attempts to get me to walk the straight and narrow, but she was also damn good in bed so I figured on balance there were worse things I could endure.

“Let’s face it,” I said. “I’m part of a grand tradition of criminal geniuses who were so good at what they did that by the time they were done they were seen as pillars of society.”

“Or you’re like people who do white-collar crime on such a huge scale they only get a slap on the wrist and sent to a minimum-security country club for a few weeks even though the damage they do is far outsized compared to somebody dealing a little pot here and there or someone stealing from the corner store,” Fialux said. “You can afford a better lawyer so even when you are apprehended you get away with it.”

I grinned. “See. Now you’re getting the hang of it! Go big enough and the magnitude of your crime becomes so great that people want to get to know you rather than wanting to lock you up, and in the super powered crime industry there’s no one bigger than Night Terror.”

“Maybe,” she said. “But there’s one thing you’re not taking into account.”

“What’s that?” I asked, suddenly wary. There was something about the way she looked at me that I didn’t particularly care for.

“You’re forgetting that you’re about to go out and do something stupidly heroic to impress a girl.”

She had me there. Impressing the object of one’s affection was, at its root, pretty much why anyone does something stupidly heroic. When you got down to it, wasn’t it really the reason anyone ultimately did anything?

“Fine. We can go out and give the whole crime fighting thing a try,” I said. “For the sake of fighting crime, and not to train you or try to corner that new hero. Will that make you happy?”

It grated on me to even say it. To even insinuate that I’d be into the idea of going out and saving the city rather than trying to subjugate it to my will. But if that’s what it took to get Selena back in the saddle, to get her to finally test some of the training she obviously so desperately needed, well then I’d gladly do it.

The things I do for love.

*Senior year*. Words that’ve been striking terror into my heart all summer. I chew on breakfast, not really tasting as I consume the necessary calories and try to keep myself utterly calm and relaxed. Ever since I returned to in-person classes to finish up my junior year of high school, after the insanity of the three months leading up to my seventeenth birthday and subsequent fallout and carnage of the war between the Azures and Reiniers, I’ve discovered several things about my new hybrid condition and situation.

One: my eyes change color when I’m thirsty for blood. My human friend, Darine, pointed this out on several occasions during the last few months when I began loosing control - then regained it. I’ve managed to lie smoothly to her, telling her my eyes have always been blue-ish-green and she’s crazy to think otherwise - or needs to get her eyes checked. She’s been unusually perceptive of late.

Two: the thirst has plateaued. Sort of. I’ve had to manage the consumption of blood the way a diabetic would insulin. Drinking less or more depending on the activity or inactivity of my body. I’m still getting my supply from the Coven and their donated supply. Five blood bags is my usual, on a busy day I can drink up to eight. Anything beyond eight makes me feel a little too light-headed. And that’s another thing.

Three: blood’s become less like sustenance, and more like a drug. I’ve talked to Hale, my vampire father, about this, and he agrees with the assessment of my thinking. For now, he’s been encouraging me to go back to Colton, the town where the US branch of vampires/vampiric Coven is. The place I visited briefly during winter break so I could meet the Queen, Mina Chantal. Who moonlights as a barista, it turns out. And who makes the most amazing cup of coffee. But I haven’t gone back for another visit - or training.

Four: my mate, Zane/Blue, and I are still on precarious footing. Mostly because of the fallout and way the war my cousins caused so many casualties in his Pack, but also because I marked him without knowing. It caused a bit of a rift between us. Not literally, our bond’s as strong as ever, giving the both of us unlimited access to each other’s minds and emotional states - as well as acting like a backdoor for me to hear the roaring of his Pack- But I digress. That’s a whole other can of worms I’ve been avoiding all summer.

Five: the Azures hate me. Okay, not all the Azures. I’m still in good graces with the Alpha and Luna, and Caly - Blue’s sister - and Yuri, Blue’s closest cousin - and Misha, Yuri’s sister. But that’s where it seems to end. Everyone else is still recovering and grieving the loss of fallen comrades, blaming me for their troubles. And they’re not wrong. The random attacks from the Reiniers, my original Pack and blood-related family, were looking for me in the beginning - before changing tactics to destroy any and all my allies.

Six: my cousin, Paris, new Alpha of the Reinier Pack has been trying to get me to return to the Pack since the beginning of the summer. As insane as it sounds, I’m considering it. Just to visit, of course, not to stay. I think that would probably be suicide, considering there’s still quite a bit of unrest in the Pack. After I killed our literally insane Grandmother on my seventeenth birthday and Paris became the owner of the Alpha-ship power that had been nurtured in me since birth, we both knew there was bound to be some blow back.

Grandmother had been brainwashing the Pack for years, if not longer. Abusing her power as Alpha to control them and quite literally driving our eldest cousin, aptly nicknamed Mad-Dog Craven at the time, to the edge of sanity. Things over there have been tense, but Paris thinks by me coming to visit, and showing them all that I’m not the monster or freak of nature they once I was, will help soothe them. I told her I’d think about it and get back to her. It’s what I keep telling her at the end of each of our weekly calls.

I’m clutching a steaming mug of coffee and glaring at the schedule in front of me. My senior schedule. There’ve been times over the last seven years that were a lot like this, where I’d been nervous and equally excited to begin the school year. You’d think, now that I’m no longer being hunted by my old Pack and actually belong to something - my father’s Coven, and not the Azure Pack - that I’d be only excited to make something of my future and the freedom. I’m not.

If anything, I feel like I’m going to implode every time I think about the possibilities of my future. Endless and ever changing possibilities over crowd my thoughts as I stare at the page that’s going to dictate two-thirds of my day for the next nine months. I still have no idea what I want to do with the rest of my life. No clue as to what I should do after this year - during the year - to enhance what skills I have and begin the path to the rest of my life.

I’m afraid to think about it, if I’m being honest. Ever since I became free, really *free* for the first time in my whole life, I’ve been waiting for the other shoe to drop or smack me in the face. Waiting, holding myself back in every interaction with my friends and allied and my mate-

Ugh, that’s another part I’ve been dealing with. The terrifying *m* word. We talk amicably to each other, he texts and I reply. But the rift that’s between us has only incrementally grown over the summer - because I haven’t seen him in months - and am afraid to see him today. In less than an hour. My stomach’s alive with equal giddiness and nervous energy and pure fear at the prospect.

There’s an elephant in the room whenever we’re together. The elephant of my marking and claiming him - and him fulfilling his end by also marking and claiming me. The elephant of me drinking from him like a blood bag. The elephant of the rest of our lives stretching before us - though there’s still so much we don’t know about each other.

With a loaded sigh, so long and heavy I think my lungs will burst, I clean up the kitchen and put my schedule into my pocket. My old black back pack over one shoulder, keys in hand, I leave both my house and worries behind as I head to school to begin the first day of what feels like the rest of my life.",1,1756562643.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

1n42ffu,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatItsLike/comments/1n42ffu/assess_tide_liquid_laundry_detergent_for/,Assess Tide Liquid Laundry Detergent for Sensitive Skin Needs?,"Tide 30772121436 has been part of my laundry routine for a while now, and I’ve got to say, it’s one of those products that lives up to its promises. As someone with sensitive skin, I’m always on the lookout for hypoallergenic and fragrance-free options that don’t sacrifice performance. This liquid laundry detergent really fits the bill, but it’s not without a few areas that gave me pause.

**Packaging and Design**  
Right out of the gate, the compact design of this detergent stands out. The dimensions (7.29 x 4.3 x 11.22 inches) make it easy to store, even in smaller laundry rooms. I really appreciated the handle, which makes pouring it a breeze without risking a spill. However, I did notice that the cap’s measuring lines can be a bit hard to read under dim lighting, which occasionally led me to use more detergent than needed. At 84 fl oz, it’s advertised to last 64 loads, and while I didn’t count every load, it seems accurate if you follow the recommended usage.

**Performance and Stain Removal**  
The cleaning power of this detergent is where it shines. Despite being free of dyes and fragrances, it works wonders on typical stains like coffee, grass, and spaghetti sauce. My toddler’s clothes tend to pick up every stain imaginable, and this formula effectively cuts through them without a hitch. I even tested it on a white shirt that had been sitting with a set-in stain, and it came out significantly better, if not completely spotless. While some detergents claim to work well in cold water but fall short, this one doesn’t disappoint. My energy bill appreciates the cold-water capability, too!  

[Grab Tide 30772121436 at the best price on Amazon.](https://info.sanue.com/p/b0cqppt3lp/)  

**Hypoallergenic Formula for Sensitive Skin**  
What truly drew me to this product is its hypoallergenic formula. My partner and I have sensitive skin, and finding a detergent that doesn’t leave us itching or with rashes is a chore. This Tide detergent has been dermatologically tested and certified by the NEA (National Eczema Association), making it a safe choice for the whole family. Since it’s free from perfumes and dyes, it doesn’t leave behind any overwhelming scent that some other products do. That’s a benefit I didn’t know I needed until I had it.

**Good Aspects**  
• Specially formulated for sensitive skin  
• Works effectively in both cold and warm water  
• Removes stubborn stains without over-scrubbing  
• Free from dyes and perfumes, making it suitable for all fabrics  

**Pitfalls**  
• Measuring lines on the cap can be tricky to see  
• May require a second wash for deeply set or grease-heavy stains  
• Premium pricing compared to store-brand detergents  

**Usage Convenience**  
One of the biggest upsides is how versatile this detergent is. It works equally well in top-loading, front-loading, and even high-efficiency (HE) washing machines. Switching between these machines has never been an issue, making it adaptable for those of us who live in rentals with ever-changing appliances. The detergent rinses out cleanly too; there’s no soapy residue left behind, which I’ve noticed with other hypoallergenic brands.

**Competing Products**  
Comparing it to other “free and gentle” detergents on the market, like Seventh Generation or All Free Clear, Tide has a clear edge in stain removal and overall cleaning performance. Seventh Generation leans heavily into natural ingredients but lacks that deep-clean feel, especially on sweaty gym clothes. On the other hand, All Free Clear is slightly more affordable but left my clothes smelling a bit musty over time. The only area where those detergents might compete better is in their environmental credentials—Tide doesn’t emphasize biodegradable ingredients to the same extent.

**Cost Efficiency**  
While Tide Free & Gentle is on the pricier side of the spectrum, the cleaning power and reduced need for multiple washes make it worth considering. Basically, it feels like you’re paying for what you’re getting: a reliable detergent that’s gentle on your skin yet tough on stains. It’s also worth noting that this detergent retains its efficacy even when using minimal amounts, so the bottle seems to stretch further than budget options that require you to overpour.

Once over the summit, it warms as it descends, sucking precious moisture from the Interior Plateau below. The cycle repeats as the wind crosses the Selkirks and Rockies until it crests the divide and descends to the continent below, a fast warm sponge.*

 *Temperatures rise ten degrees in an hour; a foot of snow vanishes overnight. Life quickens; animals emerge blinking from secure dens and buds may be tricked from dormancy. Yet all too soon, the fickle wind passes and winter returns.*

 

Jesse woke up early, as the late February sun peeked over the eastern horizon, and “Here Comes the Sun” playing on his clock radio. He’d hated the song when it had been on constant repeat in in the cramped six-man trailer during his work term north of Fort McMurray.

 But today it was okay. The trailer was warmer than usual, confirming the feeling in his bones last night. He smiled at the band of blue sky to the west. A Chinook all right and it looked to be a good one.

About time too! After three weeks of -30⁰ C, he needed a break. The pipes to the stock tanks had frozen solid twice, as if knocking an inch or two of ice off the watering trough each morning wasn't enough. Yet a winter working outside on Richie’s Ranch was much better than working in the foul air of Fort Mac.

With the break in the weather, he’d be busy. Moving hay to the back fifty. Checking the fences for breaks and strays; transferring any near-term cows, especially heifers, and new calves to the front forty. Next, he’d drive into Cochrane for supplies for the main house. Mr. Richie’s sons would be up for the weekend as this was their “Study Week.” They’d bring in more than enough beer, booze, and drugs, but he’d have to provide bacon, eggs, milk, flour, token fruits and vegetables, and other supplies.

Leaving the breakfast dishes in the sink, Jesse headed to the barn. The ranch hound, Duke, a boisterous Great Dane-Lab cross, greeted him with a head thrust, wet tongue and full-body press, wolfed down his kibble, and followed Jesse out. For once, the yard work was light, the pipes were clear with only a thin film of ice on the watering troughs. Over ten inches of snow had vanished overnight, but the fields were only muddy around the hay feeders and water troughs.

Jesse loaded the truck with hay, Duke hopped in, and they headed out along the fence lines. On reaching the back fifty, Jesse heard ravens cawing at the forest line. He grabbed his binocs. A distraught heifer was bawling beside a calf lying stiffly on the frozen ground. Lacking experience, she must have gone off by herself to calve and abandoned her calf. Jesse felt sorry for both the calf whose brief life was cut short by the deep freeze, and the heifer who had lost her first calf.

Yet the dead calf also provided needed sustenance to the ravens, foxes and coyotes who were jostling to get their share. After three weeks of minus thirty, they ignored his approach and focused on the meal before them. There was something else too – a dark bird, with a big head and beak, much larger than a raven. It stretched its wings and displayed the distinctive white wing patches, which identified it as an immature Golden Eagle.

Jesse paused to take a deep breath. Goldens were rare to start with and should have moved south by now. But the young ones sometimes lingered. He attached the telephoto to his Nikon and drove closer. The eagle paid no attention to the ravens pulling at its tail and focused on its meal, tearing off chunks of semi-frozen beef which disappeared down its gullet. Jesse was able to take a series of great shots to add to his portfolio.

They all scattered when Duke started barking as they approached closer. But Jesse was able to pick up a tail feather the ravens had dislodged. To the Blackfeet and other tribes, eagle feathers were a symbol of power. He hoped some of it might flow his way.

The rest of the morning went well. The heifer settled and was otherwise in decent shape. If one of the cows had twins, he might even be able to get her to look after one of the two. He moved her into the front forty with the other beeves and put a very pregnant heifer into a clean stall in the barn. He reported the dead calf to the Forest Service: there was always the chance that the Fish and Wildlife Department would compensate Mr. Richie.

The supplies were all in order when Jesse arrived at the Cochrane Coop as Mr. Richie was a valued customer. He’d grown up on a ranch in the depression and knew cattle. He was among the first to shift to raising full and crossbreed Charolais, which were better suited to foothills pastures and produced the lean meat which the changing market demanded. Now, he was a well-off corporate lawyer in Calgary and able to afford his country ranch and pay Jesse every two weeks.

Jesse had restocked the main house when Mr. Richie’s sons, Fred, and his younger brother, Greg, drove in. He knew Fred from Quiz Bowl in High School, where Fred had been the team captain while Jesse was a reserve.

Both brothers were in good spirits and ready to blow off steam. Fred, normally quiet was totally stoked as he’d been accepted to the University of Alberta Law School. Jesse congratulated Fred on his acceptance, and they briefly reminisced about the Quiz Bowl days. Jesse then turned to Greg, to chat about hockey. Greg, the family's jock, was captain and first line center of the University of Calgary's Men's Hockey team, the Dinos. The team was in second place in the Canada West Association and looking good for the playoffs.

Greg’s close friend and teammate, Sam and rest of the team arrived, soon after followed by an entourage of friends and wannabes. It was “Study Week,” and everyone was ready to let off steam. Jesse swapped greetings as everyone filtered in before heading back to his trailer to avoid the party mayhem.

Last year, Jesse had been among them. But first-year partying had messed up his studies and he’d taken a year out of school to make next year’s tuition. He’d applied to the Fish and Wildlife program at the Tech Institute in Edmonton, where he hoped to find a career which mixed his love of the outdoors and photography.

Jesse couldn’t help noticing Greg’s girlfriend, Ursula, a striking dark-haired young woman, who caught everyone’s eye. In high school, she’d been known as both an artsy activist and a free spirit. This continued at Uni, but unlike Jesse, she managed to stay in the top ten percent of her tough pre-vet program. Jesse sighed; she was out of his league.

Later that evening, he was working in the improvised darkroom in the bathroom of his trailer, playing with the exposures of black and white film, when a ruckus broke out at the main house.

As he approached the ranch house, Jesse saw that both Greg and Sam had been drinking heavily and were well past boisterous, on the way to obnoxious. Sam had come on a little too close and friendly with Ursula and she’d poured a beer over his head. Sam had reciprocated. Greg had taken offence and a quarrel ensued. They had moved outside to settle the argument. The pugilists exchanged verbal taunts as they circled each other under the bright floodlight before settling into the opening clinch, each hesitant to make the first move.

Greg was by far the better athlete, fast, shifty; known for his hard shot and accurate passes. There were rumors that an NHL team, would draft him in the first round, particularly if the Dinos made it to the Finals. Greg had wrestled a bit in high school but was not a fighter.

Sam was a stay-at-home defenseman with only average skating and puck handling skills. But he was strong, tough, and didn’t back down from rough play. He’d assumed the bad ass tough guy role on the team and hadn’t lost a fight this season.

Greg broke the clinch and threw a wild swing, which Sam avoided easily but didn’t counter. Jesse could see that Sam was holding back. Greg was his friend, the team captain, and he really didn’t want to mess up everything over a girl.

Jesse knew it was time to step in before the fight escalated. He strode purposefully into their circle, thew an arm around each of the combatants and barked, “Break it up boys, we’ll have none of that here!” and pulled them apart by their collars.

Both looked sheepishly at the ground, unsure how to proceed. Then Ursula stepped in, taking each by hand saying, “We need to mellow out. Let’s go back and finish that joint!” This broke the tension, and everyone laughed as they headed back to the ranch house, while an impromptu DJ played “Come Together.”

With the furor over, Jesse went back to his trailer to work on his photos.

Later that night, there was a pounding on Jesse’s trailer door. He opened it to find a disheveled Ursula. Her eyes were open wide, too wide, as she slurred, “All work and no play makesss Jessss a dull boy. The boys both passed out and I need to play!”

Ursula gave Jesse a deep French kiss to which he immediately responded. She plastered herself against him as her tongue explored his mouth.

But their clench was interrupted by a loud bawling and barking from the barn. Jesse sighed and cursed inwardly; it had been a long time. Reluctantly, he broke their clench and together they headed to the barn.

On entering the barn, they saw that heifer’s water had broken, and she was on her side and in labour. Duke was barking at the kerfuffle. Jesse had watched his grandfather deliver a calf at his farm. He had also read the protocols when he applied for the ranch job. However, he lacked practical experience. But Ursula immediately sobered up and took charge. She was familiar with the procedures from her pre-vet program and had helped deliver calves at her uncle’s ranch.

Fortunately, it was a face-forward delivery. After three unsuccessful attempts, they managed to tie off the calf’s front feet and together pulled on the rope. The calf’s front legs and head slowly emerged, after which nature took over and the rest of the bull calf’s body followed. Ursula cut the umbilical cord and painted tincture of iodine over the umbilical stump to prevent infection. They were bloody, messy, and dirty yet totally caught up in the magic of the calf’s birth.

An hour later, the heifer had shed the placenta. The calf though shaky on it pins, managed to stand and was showing an interest in nursing. They moved the heifer and calf into a clean stall, cleaned the birthing stall, and left the barn.

Jesse and Ursula trudged tiredly to their respective quarters to shower and catch a few hours of sleep.

Jesse woke up late the next morning, with Dylan and Cash rasping “Girl from the North Country” on his radio. As the song ended, the announcer declared that a weather warning was in effect. The wind had shifted to the north-east, the temperature was falling, and heavy snow was coming. That explained the quiet main house. No one in that crowd wanted to be stuck at a ranch outside Cochrane in the middle of a blizzard.

Jesse headed to the barn and saw that both the heifer and her calf were looking good. She was eating and the calf nursing. To be safe, he called the vet, Dr. Martin, who was annoyed at a Sunday call, but made it to the ranch in under half an hour. He confirmed that both cow and calf were doing good. He told Jesse that it was at least another week before the other pregnant heifer calved, but to keep look out on her.

When Jesse checked the main house, he found it spotless. There was an envelope on the kitchen table with his name on it. Inside was a note from Ursula.

“Jesse thanks for last night. Delivering the calf was a real rush. I checked in at the barn and both mom and calf are doing well.

I’m sorry if I was a bit woolly last night. I was caught up in the celebrations, as I’d just been accepted to the Vet School. We’ve cleaned up and I left pancakes and bacon in the warming oven. We’re heading back to Calgary early to avoid the coming storm

All the best for your studies in Edmonton.

 Ursula”

Jesse stifled a sigh as he sipped a cup of lukewarm coffee while finishing off the pancakes and bacon. In retrospect he was glad his fumbling with Ursula hadn’t gone further. Like Sam, he really didn’t want to mess things up with the Richie’s over a girl. Another spark extinguished, yet a soupçon of regret remained.

As Jesse went back out for the morning’s chores, it was clear the weather bureau was right this time. The wind had shifted to the North-East and was picking up and the temperature dropping. The Chinook had passed, and a blizzard was approaching.

She sat in the coffee shop, chin resting on her palm, waiting for her order. College awaited her later in the day, and the thought alone made her sigh.

""Why is life so hard?"" she muttered under her breath, her gaze drifting toward the window.

Then, suddenly, her eyes widened. Her hand dropped from her face as she straightened, almost in shock at what she saw. A guy was walking toward the café, dressed entirely in black—black collared T-shirt, black jacket, black pants, and shoes to match, like his entire wardrobe consisted of nothing but that one color. He was tall, easily six feet, with a lean muscular build. His dark hair was combed back in an elegant, wavy style, and his eyes—jet black, framed with lashes longer than hers—made him stand out even more.

Ella’s friend Anna noticed the way she was staring at him, practically with her mouth open.

“That’s Elliot,” Anna said dryly, raising an eyebrow. “The dashing boy you’re drooling over.”

“You know him?” Ella asked, not tearing her eyes away from him for a second.

“Everyone knows him. He’s the campus red flag. If I were you, I’d stop right there.” Anna scoffed, crossing her arms.

“Why? What’s so bad about him?” Ella asked, her voice laced with curiosity.

Anna rolled her eyes. “He’s not exactly evil, but he’s a player. Never sticks to one girl. Thinks way too highly of himself—ego like the devil himself, I swear.”

Ella tilted her head, a soft smile tugging at her lips. “Hmm… doesn’t look that bad to me.”

Her tone gave away her interest, which only made Anna groan. “Oh no. Don’t even think about it. You just moved here. Don’t get involved with him.” She gave Ella a firm nudge on the arm.

Ella had only recently shifted to this town, leaving her old life behind for her studies. Anna, her childhood friend, had been here longer—ever since her father had landed a better job. Unlike Anna, Ella was still wide-eyed and trusting. She carried an almost naïve belief that everyone was good at heart—or at the very least, that they could be changed for the better.

1n425v5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlchemyBeauty/comments/1n425v5/explore_best_laundry_detergent_liquid_the/,Explore Best Laundry Detergent Liquid The Laundress Worth It,"Testing out The Laundress WTCLS32001 over the past few weeks has been quite the experience for someone like me who’s always on the lookout for laundry products that actually deliver on their promises. This laundry detergent claims to ""whiten and brighten"" clothes with a hefty punch of enzyme power, and I’ve thrown it into the trenches to see how it performs in my day-to-day laundry routine.

**Design and Packaging**

The presentation of this product is neat and uncomplicated, which I appreciate. It comes in a 32-ounce bottle with a modern yet straightforward design. The lightweight consistency caught me off guard at first, as I was expecting something thicker. Turns out, this feature really helps with dosing, reducing the risk of spilling or over-pouring. Although it’s designed to pair with one of their measuring cups (which is sold separately), eyeballing the amount works well enough if you’re used to liquid detergents. The bottle is easy to handle, and at 2 pounds, it doesn’t feel cumbersome. 

**Performance and Cleaning Power**

I mainly used this detergent on my white sheets and a few light-colored shirts that see frequent wear and tear. The triple-enzyme complex lives up to the hype. Coffee stains, tomato sauce splatters, and random grease marks all came out noticeably cleaner after just one wash. Even some set-in stains I had almost given up on faded significantly after two cycles. I tested it in both warm and cold water, and it performed consistently across both, making it versatile for a range of laundry temperatures. There’s also the bonus that it works well in all types of machines, so no one is left out.

**Highlights**

- Perfect for whitening and brightening both white and light-colored clothes.
- Bio-based ingredients are tough on stubborn stains but feel gentle on fabrics.
- Suitable for all types of water temperatures and washing machines.
- The lightweight consistency makes it less of a mess when dosing.

[Check The Laundress WTCLS32001 price on Amazon.](https://stylistexperts.com/p/b0cn3qpk4l/)

**Fragrance**

The Classic scent adds an elegant touch to laundry day. Its notes of lily of the valley, jasmine, and sweet musk left a clean, sophisticated smell on my linens and clothes without being overpowering. My partner complimented the fragrance on our sheets, and I noticed it lingered for several days after washing. If you’re not into heavily perfumed detergents, this one hits the balance between subtle and fresh just right.

**Drawbacks**

- The measuring cup for precise dosing isn’t included, which feels like an oversight for a premium product.
- Despite its consistency being convenient to pour, it may feel a bit too runny compared to traditional liquid detergents.
- Large families or heavy users might find the 32-ounce bottle runs out fairly quickly.

**Product Competitors**

Compared to other detergents promising brilliant whites, like OxiClean or Tide Brights + Whites, this product stands out for using more eco-conscious, bio-based ingredients. While OxiClean has potent stain-fighting capabilities, its powder formula sometimes leaves residue if not dissolved properly. Tide, on the other hand, feels more geared toward mass-market appeal but lacks that premium touch of fragrance and gentle treatment for delicate whites. Where The Laundress WTCLS32001 shines brightest is in balancing strong, effective cleaning power with a subtle touch of elegance, making it a more upscale option for those who care about both results and presentation.

**Cost-Effectiveness**

For its size and claims, this detergent does fall on the pricier side compared to standard supermarket options. However, the quality and performance justify the cost to a large extent. The formula is concentrated enough for up to 31 washes, which mitigates the sting of its slightly higher price tag. If your laundry primarily consists of whites or light-colored clothing that you want to keep pristine, this product is worth considering for its effectiveness and thoughtful formulation.

Or maybe, following modern trends, God would be using some cloud-based email service or even Slack? 😂 I can imagine Bruce struggling with Gmail, drowning in God’s spam folder. Any other elements from the movie you think would be fun to modernize?

Me: Hmm, I’m not sure. What else could there be? Maybe that scene where he parts the Red Sea?

AI: Ooh, there’s so much potential to modernize Bruce Almighty! Since you mentioned the Red Sea parting scene (well, the soup-parting scene in the movie, lol), let’s start there and brainstorm some more.
1.  Modernized Red Sea (Soup) Parting Scene: In the original, Bruce uses his divine powers to part soup in a diner to impress people. In a 2025 version, I bet Bruce would be in a trendy café, parting an avocado toast or a latte art masterpiece for the perfect Instagram Reels moment. 😎 Picture the coffee foam splitting like the Red Sea, going viral on social media! The audience reactions would be flooding X posts in real time.
2.  God’s Communication Method: Originally, prayers came through Yahoo email. In a modern version, it’d be Gmail or Outlook for sure, or maybe God’s running a Discord server or WhatsApp group for prayers. Imagine Bruce getting overwhelmed with prayer notifications and turning off push alerts. Or maybe an AI assistant (like AI!) sorting prayers for him? 😏
3.  Bruce’s Job: Bruce was a local TV reporter in the original. In 2025, he’d probably be a YouTuber or TikToker. With divine powers, he’d hit a billion subscribers and show off miracles during live streams! But he’d probably have a meltdown managing the troll-filled comment section.
4.  God’s Office: In the original, God (Morgan Freeman) appeared as a janitor in a rundown building. In a modern remake, God might show up in a tech startup-style open office or a metaverse space, rocking a VR headset. “Bruce, clear the prayer backlog in the metaverse!” he’d say.
5.  Transportation: Remember Bruce cruising around with divine powers? In 2025, he’d probably be zipping through New York in a Tesla or on an electric scooter, performing miracles on the go. Or maybe he’d be taking an Uber Black to solve prayers in style!

**Odds Breakdown: The Math Doesn’t Lie (Mostly)**  
The bookmakers have spoken, and they’re as confident as a Parisian in a beret: **Paris Saint-Germain is the clear favorite**. Converting the decimal odds (1.33 for PSG, 8.5 for Toulouse, and 5.65 for the draw) into implied probabilities paints a stark picture. PSG’s 75% chance to win? That’s like betting on the sun rising, but with more *je ne sais quoi*. Toulouse’s 11%? That’s about the odds of me correctly spelling “Kvaratskhelia” without a cheat sheet. The draw? A meager 18%—less likely than Luis Enrique finally admitting coffee is overrated.

**News Digest: Kvaratskhelia’s Return, Chevalier’s New Job**  
PSG’s squad announcement is a masterclass in “drop the mic.” Georgian winger **Khvicha Kvaratskhelia** returns from injury, a spark plug for an attack that’s already shown it can win with a “biscuit-bag” approach (i.e., narrow 1-0 and 0-1 victories). Manager Luis Enrique, a man who could coach a synchronized swimming team into a mathletes competition, has all his key players fit. New goalkeeper **Lucas Chevalier**—recently acquired like a rare Pokémon—adds a “fresh face” energy to a defense that’s been as leaky as a cheese factory in a monsoon.

Toulouse, meanwhile, is the sports equivalent of a surprise party: you know they’re here, but you’re not entirely sure how. They’ve won their first two matches, which is either impressive or a statistical fluke depending on who you ask. Their dark-horse vibes are strong, but they’re up against a PSG machine that’s still riding high from Champions League and Super Cup wins.

This is my first time posting something like this, so I’m not totally sure how to start, but the easiest way is probably to share a bit about myself and why I’m here.

I moved to the Netherlands about 6 years ago to study computer science. In my last year I met my girlfriend (we’re still together), and around the same time I started working. Fast forward 3 years since graduating… and I’ve realized I’m actually pretty lonely.

Most of my close friends from uni moved away after graduation, and I didn’t help the situation much. I poured most of my time into work and my relationship, which sped up losing touch. I regret that now, but instead of beating myself up, I’m trying to fix it, so here I am.

I’d describe myself as pretty extroverted and very chatty once I’m comfortable. Initially I can shut down and get shy, which makes it harder to connect, but I’m aware of it and working on it.

A little about me:

* Love biking and long walks around the city
* Big fan of movies/shows, coffee, and cooking
* Used to be really into building mechanical keyboards
* I enjoy board games a lot (maybe we could check out a board game night online or in person someday?)
* Don’t game as much anymore, but I used to play a lot of Overwatch, Battlefield, Titanfall, and I still keep up with gaming news
* I have a dark sense of humor and really enjoy watching stand-up comedy
* I love travelling, and one of my goals is to do the Eibsee loop in Germany, turns out getting there is a bit trickier than I thought
* I’m a sucker for passion: if you’re wildly into something, your enthusiasm is contagious. Even if I’m not into it at first, I usually end up getting hooked

And so much more, this list is just what I could think of on the train to work. If your hobbies/interests don’t exactly align, don’t worry, I’m open to trying and exploring new stuff

# So yeah, whether you’re nearby in the Netherlands or halfway across the world, I’d love to make some new connections.

An easy icebreaker: tell me something you’re really passionate about so we can dive into it or, if you prefer, a dark joke is always welcome. Always happy to chat online, and who knows, maybe even meet up someday if life lines up that way!",1,1756561699.0,Needafriend,1,1.0,False

Long story short, we had some moments of flirting in the past, and even a date and some light level physical closeness. But l never wanted to go beyond that and openly said that and we moved beyond (or could't). He is a type who flirts around and (what annoys me really a lot) talks behind women he was with. At the same time, he is quite fun to be around, chatty and humourous. Over the years, l occassionally met him for coffee. But there are two reasons l want to end this friendship:1) l am growing further and further apart from his personality traits, life views (relationship, friends) and also politics. l am central, he is much more conservative. 2) l always feel a flirt vibe and feel like we will never truly be friends,  if we have a drink or two he always has a few flirty comments, so l stopped having any drinks around him, basically guarding the boundaries. A while ago l stopped engaging with his texts. Either late/very short ones or no reply. He lives in my neighbourhood so sadly l sometimes see him around (rare)..On the last time l saw him in a shop,  l had to say hi and shared that l was just going through a stressful time with job.

The North-East derby between Leeds United and Newcastle United is a clash of two teams with more injuries than a family reunion at a orthopedic convention. Let’s parse the chaos with the precision of a spreadsheet and the humor of a stand-up comedian who’s had one too many coffees.

**Odds Breakdown: The Math of Misery**  
The betting odds tell a clear story: Newcastle United is the favorite, with implied probabilities hovering around **47%** (based on -212 odds at MyBookie.ag). Leeds United, meanwhile, sits at a paltry **\~29%**, while the draw scrapes in at \~29%. To put this in perspective, Leeds’ chances of winning are about the same as me correctly predicting the outcome of a game of roulette—assuming the roulette wheel is operated by a sleep-deprived raccoon.

Newcastle’s dominance in this fixture is as reliable as a Netflix password expiring on a Friday night. They’ve won seven of their last 14 Premier League visits to Elland Road, a record that’s as sturdy as a brick wall… if that brick wall were built by bricklayers who all happened to be named Tony. Leeds, on the other hand, have gone 21 home games unbeaten under Daniel Farke, but let’s not get too excited—this streak includes three draws, which is football’s way of saying, “We’re here, but we don’t care.”

**Injury Report: A Who’s Who of Absentees**  
Both teams are dealing with absences, but Leeds’ injuries read like a “Where’s Waldo?” for soccer players. Ethan Ampadu, Ao Tanaka, and Noah Okafor are out, leaving their midfield as thin as a £10 takeaway pizza crust. Newcastle isn’t exactly rolling in bodies either—Anthony Gordon (sent off recently), Joelinton (groin), and Sandro Tonali (shoulder) are all sidelined. However, Leeds’ trio of missing stars feels more like losing your starting hand in poker, while Newcastle’s injuries are more like l

Advice?,"I’m 28 and sometimes I feel like my dating experiences are pushing me toward becoming bitter, which is not who I want to be. I’ve only been in one relationship before and it ended five years ago. Since then I’ve been on and off the apps, gone on dates, and met people, but nothing has turned into the kind of partnership I really want.

One of the biggest issues I run into is that a lot of men I meet through the apps want to rush into sex by the first or second date. I’m just not a hookup type of person. I’ve realized that I feel most comfortable being physically intimate once I’m already in a relationship, when there’s trust and commitment involved. I’m not trying to judge anyone who enjoys casual dating, but it’s not for me. The problem is that when men see I don’t want to rush into that, it feels like they move on instantly, like I’m disposable or replaceable.

What stings is that I have so much going for me. I moved abroad recently, I’m open-minded, adventurous, building a great life for myself, and I genuinely desire companionship and partnership. I’m not sitting at home miserable.  I actually have a good, full life. But dating has been the one area where I feel really unseen.

Even when I’ve met people offline it’s been similar. For example, there’s a guy at a coffee shop I go to regularly. We exchanged numbers and I was genuinely excited, thinking maybe this could turn into something. But almost immediately, instead of asking me out properly, he texted me to meet up very late at night around 11pm, and started asking if I live alone or with roommates. That completely killed it for me. It made his intentions very clear and again, it wasn’t about me as a person.

When I bring this up to some of my friends, they just echo how jaded they are about men and dating. I get that modern dating can be exhausting,  but I don’t want to become a man-hater or live my life closed off. I want to have a healthy view of men and relationships. I know at the end of the day the common denominator in all of this is me, and I’ve been doing therapy to reflect on where I might be going wrong. I know I can sometimes be too forgiving, and maybe I keep my guard too low. But I don’t want to swing the other way and put my guard up so high that I shut out potential good connections.

I guess my question is: how do you keep hope alive when dating feels like one letdown after another? How do you protect your heart without becoming bitter? Because at my core, I still want to believe there are good men out there who want something real",1,1756561491.0,TwoXChromosomes,2,0.67,False

I didn’t think much of it until I noticed my phone randomly connecting and disconnecting, and it got me paranoid that my info wasn’t safe. I downloaded a free VPN from the App Store just to test it, but the thing kept dropping every few minutes and killed my browsing speed to the point where even Instagram wouldn’t load.

Then I tried using Apple’s built-in iCloud Private Relay since I already pay for iCloud storage. It was smoother than the free VPN and worked fine for Safari, but I realized it doesn’t cover all apps, which kinda defeats the purpose if I’m using stuff like TikTok, banking apps, or streaming. That’s when I started looking at proper VPNs like Surfshark, Nord, and Proton because I want something that works across my MacBook, iPad, and iPhone without constant headaches. Has anyone here found a VPN that works best on Apple devices specifically? I’d love to hear if there’s one that doesn’t slow everything down but still keeps things private.",1,1756561463.0,VPN_Question,1,1.0,False

Instead of the usual 7–10 minutes (or even longer), the process can now be done in as little as 2 minutes.

The service is jointly launched by the Hangzhou Municipal Bureau of Culture, Radio, TV and Tourism, the Hangzhou Tax Service, State Administration of Taxation, and the Hangzhou Municipal Bureau of Commerce, in collaboration with Alipay and Zheshang Bank. 

The system is built around Alipay and streamlines the whole chain: self-service application by the traveler, one-click invoicing by the merchant, and automated processing on the backend.

The service is on trial operation at six **Wensli** stores.

Merchants also benefit since the paperwork is massively reduced.



**Why it’s a big deal:**

·Speed: First-time refunds drop from \~10 minutes to \~5; for repeat users it’s literally 2 minutes.

·Smart upgrades: “Pay = invoice” and Alipay pre-authorization make the whole refund path digital.

·Flexibility: Besides Alipay, the system also supports credit cards, cash, and WeChat Pay.

This fits into Hangzhou’s broader push for “8 One-stop conveniences” for inbound tourism: from one-tap hotel check-in and transport cards to AI-powered itinerary builders. They’ve branded the whole thing as AI Hangzhou Easy Travel.



**Other recent upgrades:**

·Number of tax-refund shops in Hangzhou is now **267,** with 124 offering “**instant tax-refund**” in store.

·Processing time has been cut from 20 minutes earlier this year → 7–10 minutes → now 2 minutes.

·Refund limits raised: max per purchase from ￥50k → ￥222k, min lowered to ￥200.

·Refund services expanded from **Hangzhou** airport to **Ningbo**, **Wenzhou**, and **Zhoushan** airports.

·In-store instant tax refunds are no longer just cash — Alipay works too.

 (Things you may not know about **instant tax-refund**” in store: Overseas tourists shopping at these stores for over 500 yuan can immediately handle their tax refund without leaving the store, with the refund directly credited to their Alipay account.)



**More to expect**

Hangzhou isn’t stopping here either. The city plans to keep expanding the “instant tax refund” policy to more departure points. Beyond airports, they’re now rolling out self-service refund kiosks across major shopping areas. The first two machines are already set up at MixC Mall and Sasseur Outlets, tested and ready to go online soon. Once live, travelers can just walk up to a kiosk, tap through the steps, and get their refund right there — making the whole “shop → refund → done” experience even smoother.



**Big picture:** China’s inbound tourism is booming this year, and the so-called “three treasures” of traveling here are visa-free entry, tax refunds, and Alipay. According to Alipay, spending by inbound tourists in Zhejiang more than doubled in the first half of 2025 compared to last year.

So yeah — if you’re visiting Hangzhou (think West Lake, Hefang Street shopping, or Wensli silk), you can now buy stuff, tap once, and get your refund before your coffee is ready.

1n41yjr,https://www.reddit.com/r/awareness_series/comments/1n41yjr/stop_making_excuses_and_start_living_your_best/,Stop Making Excuses and Start Living Your Best Life 💪,"
Life has a funny way of throwing challenges at us, and somehow, we've become masters at creating excuses for why we can't overcome them. But what if I told you that most of the barriers holding you back aren't real? What if the only thing standing between you and your goals is your own collection of well-rehearsed justifications?

## The Excuse Epidemic 🦠

We live in an age of endless distractions and easy outs. Every day, millions of people wake up with dreams and aspirations, only to let them slip away because of excuses that feel valid but are actually just comfortable lies we tell ourselves.

The truth is harsh but liberating: most excuses are simply fear dressed up in reasonable-sounding clothing. When we say we don't have time, what we often mean is that we're afraid of prioritizing what matters. When we claim something is too complicated, we're usually just scared of the learning curve ahead.

## Breaking Down the Common Culprits 🔨

### ""I'm Always Tired"" 😴

This is perhaps the most popular excuse of our generation. We drag ourselves through days feeling like zombies, blaming everything from the weather to our genetics. But here's the reality check: if you're constantly exhausted, you're probably not managing your sleep properly.

**The Action Plan:**
- Set a consistent bedtime and stick to it, even on weekends
- Create a wind-down routine that doesn't involve screens
- Make your bedroom a sanctuary for sleep only
- Track your sleep patterns for a week and identify what's sabotaging your rest

Your energy levels are largely within your control. Stop treating sleep like an optional activity and start treating it like the foundation of everything else you want to achieve.

### ""I'm Out of Shape"" 🏃‍♂️

Another classic. We look in the mirror, don't like what we see, and then proceed to do absolutely nothing about it while complaining about our appearance. This excuse often comes with a side of ""I don't have good genes"" or ""I'm just naturally bigger.""

**The Reality Check:**
Your body responds to what you do with it. Feed it processed food and park it on a couch for hours, and it will show you exactly what that lifestyle produces. Move it regularly and fuel it with nutritious food, and it will reward you with strength, energy, and confidence.

**The Action Plan:**
- Start with 15 minutes of movement daily - walking counts
- Replace one unhealthy food choice with a better option each week
- Find activities you actually enjoy rather than forcing yourself into a gym routine you hate
- Focus on how exercise makes you feel rather than just how it makes you look

### ""I Don't Have Time"" ⏰

This is the ultimate excuse because it sounds so reasonable and universal. Everyone is busy, so surely this justification is bulletproof, right? Wrong.

The truth is uncomfortable: you have time for what you prioritize. You found time to scroll through social media for an hour yesterday. You found time to watch that Netflix series. You found time to complain about not having time.

**The Time Audit Challenge:**
- Track every hour of your day for one week
- Identify time-wasters and energy drains
- Calculate how much time you spend on passive entertainment
- Replace just one hour of mindless activity with progress toward your goals

Time isn't something you find - it's something you create by making conscious choices about what deserves your attention.

### ""I Don't Have Money"" 💰

Financial constraints are real, but they're also one of the most over-used excuses for not pursuing goals. While money can certainly make some things easier, lack of it rarely makes improvement impossible.

**The Resourcefulness Revolution:**
- Most valuable skills can be learned for free through online resources
- Libraries offer access to countless books, courses, and even internet access
- Community centers often provide low-cost fitness and educational opportunities
- Networking and skill-sharing can replace expensive formal training

Instead of focusing on what you can't afford, get creative about what you can access. Some of the most successful people started with nothing but determination and resourcefulness.

### ""It's Too Complicated"" 🧩

Complexity is often just an illusion created by looking at the end goal instead of the next step. When you want to learn a new language, write a book, or start a business, it can feel overwhelming if you think about everything at once.

**The Simplification Strategy:**
- Break big goals into tiny, manageable actions
- Focus only on the next immediate step
- Celebrate small wins to build momentum
- Remember that confusion is temporary but giving up is permanent

Every expert was once a beginner. Every master was once a mess. Complexity dissolves when you stop staring at the mountain and start taking the first step up the trail.

### ""I Don't Know How"" 🤷‍♂️

In an age where you can learn virtually anything online, this excuse has lost all credibility. The information is out there - what's missing is the initiative to find it and the discipline to apply it.

**The Learning Action Plan:**
- Start with free resources like YouTube tutorials and online courses
- Join communities of people pursuing similar goals
- Find mentors who've achieved what you want to achieve
- Commit to learning something new every single day, even if it's just for 10 minutes

Ignorance is a choice in the information age. The question isn't whether you can learn something - it's whether you're willing to put in the effort to learn it.

### ""I Have No Energy"" ⚡

Low energy is often the result of lifestyle choices rather than unchangeable circumstances. What you eat, how you move, and how you think all directly impact your energy levels.

**The Energy Optimization Protocol:**
- Eliminate energy vampires from your diet (processed foods, excessive sugar, too much caffeine)
- Add energy boosters (whole foods, regular movement, adequate hydration)
- Address mental energy drains (toxic relationships, negative thought patterns, clutter)
- Create energizing rituals (morning routines, mid-day breaks, evening reflection)

Your energy is renewable, but only if you're intentional about how you generate and use it.

## The Psychology Behind Excuses 🧠

Understanding why we make excuses is crucial to overcoming them. Excuses serve several psychological purposes:

**Protection from Failure:** If we don't try, we can't fail. Excuses keep us in our comfort zone where disappointment feels less likely.

**Social Acceptance:** Society often rewards victim mentality and accepts excuses as valid reasons for lack of progress.

**Cognitive Dissonance Relief:** When our actions don't match our stated values, excuses help resolve the uncomfortable tension.

**Energy Conservation:** Our brains are wired to conserve energy, and excuses provide an easy way to avoid the mental effort required for change.

Recognizing these patterns is the first step to breaking free from them.

## The Excuse-Busting Mindset Shift 🔄

Instead of asking ""Why can't I?"" start asking ""How can I?"" This simple reframe changes you from a victim of circumstances to a problem-solver looking for solutions.

**Before:** ""I can't exercise because I don't have a gym membership.""
**After:** ""How can I stay active without a gym membership?""

**Before:** ""I can't learn that skill because I don't have formal training.""
**After:** ""How can I develop this skill using available resources?""

**Before:** ""I can't start that project because I don't know where to begin.""
**After:** ""What's the smallest possible first step I could take today?""

This mindset shift transforms obstacles into puzzles to solve rather than walls to hide behind.

## Building Your No-Excuse Lifestyle 🏗️

Creating lasting change requires more than just eliminating excuses - it requires building systems that make progress inevitable.

### Design Your Environment for Success 🎯

Your environment shapes your behavior more than your willpower does. Instead of relying on motivation, create conditions that make good choices automatic.

- If you want to read more, place books everywhere and hide your phone
- If you want to eat better, stock your kitchen with healthy options and remove tempting junk food
- If you want to exercise regularly, lay out your workout clothes the night before
- If you want to learn a new skill, set up dedicated practice space and schedule specific times

### Create Accountability Systems 📊

Accountability transforms intentions into actions. When you know someone is watching or depending on you, excuses become much harder to maintain.

**Accountability Options:**
- Find a workout partner who won't let you skip sessions
- Join online communities focused on your goals
- Share your progress publicly on social media
- Work with a coach or mentor who will call you out on excuses
- Create financial consequences for not following through

### Develop the ""No Matter What"" Mentality 🛡️

This mindset means you'll find a way to make progress regardless of circumstances. It doesn't mean being rigid or ignoring genuine emergencies, but it does mean refusing to let minor inconveniences derail your goals.

**Examples in Action:**
- If the gym is closed, do bodyweight exercises at home
- If you can't afford courses, find free alternatives online
- If you don't have an hour, use the 10 minutes you do have
- If Plan A doesn't work, immediately move to Plan B

## The Ripple Effect of Excuse-Free Living 🌊

When you stop making excuses in one area of life, it creates a positive ripple effect that touches everything else. The confidence you build by following through on fitness goals transfers to professional challenges. The discipline you develop in learning new skills makes you more reliable in relationships.

People notice when you become someone who does what they say they'll do. Opportunities start flowing toward individuals who have a reputation for execution rather than explanation.

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them ⚠️

### The All-or-Nothing Trap
Perfectionism often masquerades as an excuse. ""If I can't do it perfectly, why bother doing it at all?"" This thinking keeps you stuck because perfect conditions rarely exist.

**The Solution:** Progress over perfection. Imperfect action beats perfect inaction every single time.

### The Motivation Myth
Waiting to ""feel motivated"" is another sophisticated excuse. Motivation is unreliable and fleeting. Successful people act regardless of how they feel.

**The Solution:** Build discipline through small, consistent actions. Motivation follows action, not the other way around.

### The Comparison Game
Using others' advantages as an excuse for your lack of progress is a losing game. There will always be someone with more resources, better genetics, or fewer obstacles.

**The Solution:** Focus on your own race. Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to someone else's highlight reel.

## Your Excuse-Free Action Plan 📋

Ready to stop making excuses and start making progress? Here's your step-by-step blueprint:

### Week 1: Awareness Phase 👀
- Keep an excuse journal - write down every excuse you catch yourself making
- Identify your top 3 most-used excuses
- Research one person who achieved what you want despite similar obstacles

### Week 2: Challenge Phase 💪
- For each excuse you identified, write down 3 ways to overcome that obstacle
- Choose one small action you've been avoiding and do it immediately
- Replace one hour of passive entertainment with active progress toward a goal

### Week 3: Systems Phase ⚙️
- Create environmental changes that support your goals
- Establish an accountability system for your most important objective
- Design a simple daily routine that includes progress on your priorities

### Week 4: Integration Phase 🔄
- Review your progress and adjust your approach based on what's working
- Share your commitment publicly to increase accountability
- Plan how you'll handle setbacks without reverting to excuses

## The Long-Term Vision 🔮

Imagine looking back on your life knowing that you faced every challenge head-on instead of hiding behind excuses. Picture the confidence that comes from knowing you can figure out solutions to any problem. Envision the respect you'll earn from others who see you as someone who gets things done.

This isn't about becoming a perfectionist or never having bad days. It's about becoming the type of person who finds a way instead of finding an excuse. It's about trading the temporary comfort of justification for the lasting satisfaction of achievement.

## Your New Default Response 🎯

The next time you catch yourself about to make an excuse, pause and ask:

- Is this excuse helping me grow or keeping me stuck?
- What would someone who achieved my goal do in this situation?
- What's the smallest step I could take right now to move forward?
- How will I feel about this choice in 10 years?

Remember, every excuse you don't make is a victory. Every action you take despite not feeling ready is a step toward the person you're becoming.

## The Time is Now ⏱️

There's no perfect moment coming. There's no magical day when all obstacles will disappear and motivation will strike like lightning. There's only this moment, this choice, this opportunity to stop explaining and start executing.

Your future self is counting on the decisions you make today. They're hoping you'll choose growth over comfort, action over explanation, and progress over perfection.

The excuses will always be there, ready to provide temporary relief from the discomfort of challenge. But so will the opportunities - waiting for someone brave enough to push past the justifications and grab them.

Which will you choose? 🤔

Merchants also benefit since the paperwork is massively reduced.



**Why it’s a big deal:**

·Speed: First-time refunds drop from \~10 minutes to \~5; for repeat users it’s literally 2 minutes.

·Smart upgrades: “Pay = invoice” and Alipay pre-authorization make the whole refund path digital.

·Flexibility: Besides Alipay, the system also supports credit cards, cash, and WeChat Pay.

This fits into Hangzhou’s broader push for “8 One-stop conveniences” for inbound tourism: from one-tap hotel check-in and transport cards to AI-powered itinerary builders. They’ve branded the whole thing as AI Hangzhou Easy Travel.



**Other recent upgrades:**

·Number of tax-refund shops in Hangzhou is now **267,** with 124 offering “**instant tax-refund**” in store.

·Processing time has been cut from 20 minutes earlier this year → 7–10 minutes → now 2 minutes.

·Refund limits raised: max per purchase from ￥50k → ￥222k, min lowered to ￥200.

·Refund services expanded from **Hangzhou** airport to **Ningbo**, **Wenzhou**, and **Zhoushan** airports.

·In-store instant tax refunds are no longer just cash — Alipay works too.

 (Things you may not know about **instant tax-refund**” in store: Overseas tourists shopping at these stores for over 500 yuan can immediately handle their tax refund without leaving the store, with the refund directly credited to their Alipay account.)



**More to expect**

Hangzhou isn’t stopping here either. The city plans to keep expanding the “instant tax refund” policy to more departure points. Beyond airports, they’re now rolling out self-service refund kiosks across major shopping areas. The first two machines are already set up at MixC Mall and Sasseur Outlets, tested and ready to go online soon. Once live, travelers can just walk up to a kiosk, tap through the steps, and get their refund right there — making the whole “shop → refund → done” experience even smoother.



**Big picture:** China’s inbound tourism is booming this year, and the so-called “three treasures” of traveling here are visa-free entry, tax refunds, and Alipay. According to Alipay, spending by inbound tourists in Zhejiang more than doubled in the first half of 2025 compared to last year.

So yeah — if you’re visiting Hangzhou (think West Lake, Hefang Street shopping, or Wensli silk), you can now buy stuff, tap once, and get your refund before your coffee is ready.

My best friend was still asleep and there was absolutely NO WAY I was waking him up early on a Saturday so that I could go get a cup of coffee at the gas station. 

The other car that I could have used to jump it is a manual from the 80’s with its own idiosyncrasies completely unrelated to my being unable to drive it. 

So I looked around for a portable battery charger, was unsuccessful, and that was when my bff woke up. 

I asked him if we needed to jump the car, how would we do it, and he said “DO WE need to jump the car?” And I said yes, it’s dead. 

Well, less than 5 minutes later I was on my way to the gas station and I learned that we DO have a portable battery charger but they’ve really shrunk down and I missed it!!  

This morning I’m thankful for TEAMWORK. No, I definitely did not solve my own problem, but I knew someone who could.  THAT IS SO LUCKY!!!!   And yesterday he replaced the drain in the bathroom sink - another thing I am not good at!!  I told him THANK YOU! THANK YOU!!  We are so lucky you know how to fix stuff!!!  ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

I’ll find another problem to solve, kids. I have different skills!

1n41vi8,https://www.reddit.com/r/beginnerfitness/comments/1n41vi8/do_i_really_need_this_much_protein/,Do I really need this much Protein?,"Hi All, 

I've recently started up the gym again, and decided it may be a fun idea to use AI as a personal trainer to help me review my food choices, plan my work outs and keep track of things and suggest meals/targets. It's kind of a little experiment I've decided to do myself, but I'm also cross checking info where necessary, which is why I'm posting here to fact check some things. So I will outline as much info as possible beforehand.

My primary goal is to lose weight and cut out sweets, chocolate etc., I'm 172cm tall and just down to 139 kg from 144 after fasting (hitting around 1900 calories based on my fitness pal recommendations from last year), moved to sugar free energy drinks, and dropped them completely now as essentially having a 600 cal lunch and a ""don't worry too much"" dinner. I am planning on going to the gym 3 times a week from next week and this week went twice.  
Now I've decided to go back to the gym after a year break, but also use ChatGPT as a strict ""coach"" of sort, but also encourage to use me things other than pure cardio.

**Where it comes to my first question, is building muscle alongside some cardio more effective for losing weight? Do i really burn more calories during down time due to muscles being repaired? I added my most recent gym session at the bottom for reference.**

One main issue I'm also now running into is that in order to hit the protein goal for my weight and activity I feel like I'm ""over eating"" and going over my 1900 calories, which is to be expected to some degree, but I'm considering adding breakfast back in to even have a chance to to hit it.

**Which brings me to my second main question, is 1.2g x bodyweight really what I should be aiming for in terms or protein?**   
I'm being told I should be aiming for 145-220g of protein a day and with effort I'm hitting about 120g (by using some whey powder, swapping some lunch options for tuna and egg etc). The problem is I'm a father of 2 so the spare cash for the extra protein isn't realistically there every day, I'm also worried of over eating with increased protein, also I feel like I'm over eating, ""better"" foods but still 2 slices of rye bread with 4 eggs and then a protein yogurt would usually fill me up for a long time and dinner is only about 4 hours away.

for an example, currently at the gym i do about 5min treadmill to warm up, with some stretches after the doing about 3 sets of 8-12 reps for each machine, today for example I did 

Leg Press: 3 × 12 @ 71.25 kg  
Seated Row: 3x12 @ 37.5   
Shoulder Press: 3x8 @ 22.5  
Chest Press: 3x8 @ 30   
Plank Holds: 3 × 25 sec 

did 10 min on the treadmill after with a higher incline and then some cooling down stretches

Also for reference this is what I had to (or will have to) eat  
Morning

* Coffee (milk + espresso + vanilla): **170 kcal / 9 g protein**
* Apple (medium): **80 kcal / 0 g protein**

# Post-Gym / Lunch

* 4 eggs + 2 rye slices + butter: **\~457 kcal / 28 g protein**
* Arla Protein Yogurt (200 g strawberry): **200 kcal / 20 g protein**

# Dinner

* Spaghetti Bolognese (no cheese): **\~690 kcal / 42 g protein**

# Evening

* Whey shake (water mix): **120 kcal / 24 g protein**
* Nature Valley Protein bar (choc & peanut): **190 kcal / 10 g protein**

I know this is a lot of information, and any advice/corrections/confirmations would be appreciated so I know I'm actually doing something of benefit rather than falling into a deeper hole and get demotivated.",1,1756561118.0,beginnerfitness,3,1.0,False
1n41vgs,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/1n41vgs/26_m_europe_looking_for_onlineirl_friends/,26 M Europe - Looking for Online/IRL friends,"Hi everyone,

This is my first time posting something like this, so I’m not totally sure how to start, but the easiest way is probably to share a bit about myself and why I’m here.

I moved to the Netherlands about 6 years ago to study computer science. In my last year I met my girlfriend (we’re still together), and around the same time I started working. Fast forward 3 years since graduating… and I’ve realized I’m actually pretty lonely.

Most of my close friends from uni moved away after graduation, and I didn’t help the situation much. I poured most of my time into work and my relationship, which sped up losing touch. I regret that now, but instead of beating myself up, I’m trying to fix it, so here I am.

I’d describe myself as pretty extroverted and very chatty once I’m comfortable. Initially I can shut down and get shy, which makes it harder to connect, but I’m aware of it and working on it.

A little about me:

* Love biking and long walks around the city
* Big fan of movies/shows, coffee, and cooking
* Used to be really into building mechanical keyboards
* I enjoy board games a lot (maybe we could check out a board game night online or in person someday?)
* Don’t game as much anymore, but I used to play a lot of Overwatch, Battlefield, Titanfall, and I still keep up with gaming news
* I have a dark sense of humor and really enjoy watching stand-up comedy
* I love travelling, and one of my goals is to do the Eibsee loop in Germany, turns out getting there is a bit trickier than I thought
* I’m a sucker for passion: if you’re wildly into something, your enthusiasm is contagious. Even if I’m not into it at first, I usually end up getting hooked

And so much more, this list is just what I could think of on the train to work. If your hobbies/interests don’t exactly align, don’t worry, I’m open to trying and exploring new stuff 

# So yeah, whether you’re nearby in the Netherlands or halfway across the world, I’d love to make some new connections. 

An easy icebreaker: tell me something you’re really passionate about so we can dive into it or, if you prefer, a dark joke is always welcome. Always happy to chat online, and who knows, maybe even meet up someday if life lines up that way!",3,1756561115.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

So after all the flirty messages and coffee meetups, the Bloomberg CS girl and I actually exchanged numbers (well actually we already had but we sent almost nothing over iMessage lmao) and went out to dinner. ❤️😊 It was fun, totally normal, nothing weird… and now it’s apparently becoming a drama at her office.

Bloomberg HR followed up and slashed our IB messaging “punishment” from 30 days to 15, but it comes with insane caveats. As HR ruled, we can exchange personal texts over IB, but only if Inc\*l Guy isn’t around her. If he’s anywhere near her in the office, she cannot talk to me because ""he could see her display and make him unconfortable"" (they insisted on that part). Apparently, my existence is now officially threatening to his delicate little feelings.

And here’s the kicker: she thinks this coworker is **stalking her**. He’s asking her colleagues about me, and someone even told him we went to dinner. He’s furious, and now she says **everybody in Bloomberg NYC HQ is gossiping about it**. WTF??

So basically, we’re being punished and forced to tiptoe around a jealous stalker while just trying to live normal, human lives. It’s insane. We're feeling unsafe now. I'm not working at BB, but she is and this sicko is around her and could maybe harm her? Also I work near their office so he could still stalk me.

Advice?,"I’m 28 and sometimes I feel like my dating experiences are pushing me toward becoming bitter, which is not who I want to be. I’ve only been in one relationship before and it ended five years ago. Since then I’ve been on and off the apps, gone on dates, and met people, but nothing has turned into the kind of partnership I really want.

One of the biggest issues I run into is that a lot of men I meet through the apps want to rush into sex by the first or second date. I’m just not a hookup type of person. I’ve realized that I feel most comfortable being physically intimate once I’m already in a relationship, when there’s trust and commitment involved. I’m not trying to judge anyone who enjoys casual dating, but it’s not for me. The problem is that when men see I don’t want to rush into that, it feels like they move on instantly, like I’m disposable or replaceable.

What stings is that I have so much going for me. I moved abroad recently, I’m open-minded, adventurous, building a great life for myself, and I genuinely desire companionship and partnership. I’m not sitting at home miserable.  I actually have a good, full life. But dating has been the one area where I feel really unseen.

Recently, I met a guy offline that followed the same pattern. Tere’s a guy at a coffee shop I go to regularly. We exchanged numbers and I was genuinely excited, thinking maybe this could turn into something or at least a fun date to go on. But almost immediately, instead of asking me out properly, he texted me to meet up very late at night around 11pm, and started asking if I live alone or with roommates. That completely killed it for me. It made his intentions very clear and again, it wasn’t about me as a person.

When I bring this up to some of my friends, they just echo how jaded they are about men and dating. I get that modern dating can be exhausting,  but I don’t want to become a man-hater or live my life closed off. I want to have a healthy view of men and relationships. I know at the end of the day the common denominator in all of this is me, and I’ve been doing therapy to reflect on where I might be going wrong. I know I can sometimes be too forgiving, and maybe I keep my guard too low. But I don’t want to swing the other way and put my guard up so high that I shut out potential good connections.

I guess my question is: how do you keep hope alive when dating feels like one letdown after another? How do you protect your heart without becoming bitter? Because at my core, I still want to believe there are good men out there who want something real",2,1756560904.0,dating_advice,10,1.0,False

I know this topic has been brought up a lot, but after bingeing more threads than I care to admit, I still can’t find any practical advice on how to survive it.

It’s not even that things necessarily smell bad - it’s that they smell…too much. Like an olfactory assault, my brain just short-circuits. I have to literally cover my nose, but I can only do that if I’m alone in my office.

Work is where my nose suffers most.
I manage a large healthcare facility with 200+ people, and the air is basically a buffet of scents:

- people have coffee machines at their cubicle or in their office. One girl constantly makes this extremely dark roast European coffee that smells like a burnt tire factory and then she adds hazelnut. Oh the joy!
- coworkers who reheat fish or curry should be immediately thrown in jail because wtaf.
- Random food or snacks that somehow smell ten times stronger than they do at home.

My office has no windows and a sliding door (think glass barn door) with enough air gaps to host a draft party, so there’s no escape. But the worst? Meetings. People stroll in with food, or mid-convo I suddenly get hit with their cologne, coffee, or questionable lunch. Not to mention the sound of them eating, which overstimulates me to the point of no return - all focus gone. It’s like trying to park in a busy parking lot with your music blasting - you just CANT. That’s how I am with strong smells, or repetitive noses (tapping, sniffing, coughing, etc).
Because it’s healthcare, perfumes, and diffusers won’t fly. Even passive diffusers surprisingly pack quite a punch. I don’t have much experience with essential oils because I avoid people who wear them because of the smell 🤣

Plus, half my suffering happens in hallways or pop-up conversations anyway.
So, fellow scent-sensitive souls - what works for you? Tips, tricks, magical charms? Because winter is coming, and with it, a storm of PSLs, extra-strong lattes, and no one going outside to eat. Help😭",0,1756560844.0,autism,2,0.5,False

1n41pok,https://www.reddit.com/r/westbengal/comments/1n41pok/kolkata_is_too_cheap_for_its_own_good/,Kolkata is too cheap for its own good,"Kolkata, the “City of Joy,” is dirt-cheap, and that’s exactly why it’s drowning in its own filth. Yeah, I said it. The low cost of living here isn’t a flex—it’s a curse. It’s turning Kolkata into a cesspool, and if we don’t jack up prices, this city’s going to end up looking like the backwaters of some underdeveloped African country. Controversial? Good. Let’s talk.
Auto fares? A measly 10-20 bucks for a shared ride. Bus fares? You can cross half the city for less than a Starbucks coffee. Street food? A plate of puchka or a roll for 20-30 bucks. And don’t get me started on the booze—cheap daaru flows like the Ganges. Sounds great, right? Wrong. This dirt-cheap lifestyle is why Kolkata’s stuck in a rut. When everything costs peanuts, people have zero motivation to hustle. Why grind for extra cash when you can live like a king on pocket change? This isn’t progress—it’s stagnation. It’s why the streets are littered with garbage, the infrastructure’s crumbling, and half the city looks like it’s stuck in the 90s.
Compare that to, say, Mumbai or Bangalore. You think people there are okay with mediocrity? No, because living in those cities costs an arm and a leg, so people hustle, innovate, and demand better. In Kolkata, cheap food, cheap transport, and cheap alcohol breed complacency. It’s no different from some underdeveloped African nations where low costs keep people trapped in a cycle of just getting by, with no push for growth or ambition. Harsh? Maybe, but look around—Kolkata’s roads are choked with garbage, hawkers clog every corner, and public transport is a circus. Low prices are enabling this mess.
Here’s the fix: raise the minimum cost of everything. Street food? Nothing less than 50 bucks a plate. Auto and bus fares? Start at 50 bucks a ride, minimum. Force people to feel the pinch. When costs are low, there’s no incentive to maintain quality or cleanliness—vendors cut corners, drivers overload buses, and the city pays the price. Higher prices would push vendors to up their game, force the government to fix public transport, and make people work harder to afford a better life. It’s basic economics: scarcity drives ambition, ambition drives progress. If we keep letting Kolkata be a cheap free-for-all, it’ll turn into a complete dump, if it hasn’t already.
I know what you’re thinking: “But what about the poor?” Look, I’m not saying screw the poor, but enabling a system where everyone’s okay with bare minimums isn’t helping anyone. Higher costs would push investment into better infrastructure, cleaner streets, and a city that doesn’t look like it’s perpetually stuck in a budget crisis. Kolkata deserves better than being India’s bargain-bin city. Let’s stop romanticizing “cheap” and start demanding a city that’s worth living in.

Reason is I don't like touristy things, not that they are bad but I like to experience places based on what locals do, to try to capture the essence of the city. So I don't want to go the CN tower, Ripley's aquarium, distillery district, etc. When googling what to do, I only get these recommendations.

I rather go to a local coffee shop/restaurant and walk around the neighborhood. So walking tours are my favorite thing as someone is explaining the history and cool facts of the area.

I've been to Toronto before and I stayed mostly downtown, so I'm open to going to different places. I'll also be driving so can go anywhere.

I love comedy and went to the Second City last time, and it was my favorite thing from the trip, so I'm definetely going back. I'm wondering if there are other comedy clubs that I should go?

So what would you say is a must do activity in Toronto?

I’m 30 now. My drinking has caused so much damage to my relationships my job, my health…everything.

I live with my mom. She’s staunchly anti-drinking. If she even so much as finds a can of White Claw hidden away in my room it’s WW3. Of course I’m ashamed, but sometimes I do relapse. I’ve had a very tough few years recently and I largely self medicate with alcohol for my anxiety and depression and anxiety.

This weekend they all planned a Labour Day weekend with family and friends. Usually at the cottage, the booze is flowing. Wine, coolers, shots, you name it. Till 4am. A couple of people are really really big drinkers. The worse thing is that everyone knows about my issues since I’ve made a total fool of myself before at these cabin events.

My mom begged me to go this weekend. Like, begged me. Said she really wanted me there. The thing is, at home, I at least have some semblance of control over drinking. I don’t drive so the nearest liquor store is a 40min walk. I really have to be committed to go out and get a bottle of somrthing. During the week, I’m totally sober. Weekends are a different story.

What makes it worse is I have a couple family members who almost take pleasure in putting me down because of my alcohol abuse issues. I’ve been called a drunkard before, a boozer, someone with no self control, someone even said I must be pretty low intelligence to go that far. I got a comment once about how much of a fuck up I am. 

Coupled with the fact that there is liquor everywhere at these events AND I’m going through kind of a depressive episode rn while I work with my doctor to switch me onto a new antidepressant, I have 0 patience to 1) potentially say no to drinks and 2) not lose my shit if someone makes a rude comment about me to my face.

I skipped this one out. It’s Labour Day. I would love nothing but to be in the woods, by the lake, making s’mores by the campfire. But at least at home I can easily avoid the liquor store. At the cabin, all I have to do is reach into 1000 cabinets for a bottle of whatever. Plus deal with the horrible comments about me being a failure on so many levels because I “just can’t say no”

My mom is PISSED at me. I gave her my wallet and keys and asked her to hide them in the house while she’s gone for the weekend to prove to her that I’m not gonna go out and buy booze. Also showed her that I deleted all the delivery apps from my phone.

I can’t deal with the temptation and the remarks from people this weekend. I’m trying to be sober and so I made the decision to just stay at home. I have no plans to get out of my bathrobe, and I’m going to drink as many cups of coffee as my heart desires while watching some documentaries.

I do feel sad though. I wish to god I could just say no to alcohol, and go up there and have a good time with my family. But I can’t risk it. And anyways, with my mental state being as fragile as it is I can’t handle the comments. It’s not helpful, or supportive. Theyre just mean. 

Please someone tell me I did the right thing. My mom was really upset leaving this morning without me. I feel like missing out, especially since it’s essentially the last weekend of summer. But I don’t want to drink, I really don’t want to. I’m sick of embarrassing myself and crying cause I’m so drunk and putting a damper on everyone’s mood. I know there’s a chance of that happening if I went up. Here at least I don’t have to worry about that.

I feel awful. My family is so mad at me. I have a hard time opening up to them. I am trying to get better, but as you all know, climbing out of the pit of alcohol abuse is not easy. I think I did the right thing, but I’m not so sure. I wish I was at the stage where I could say no thanks if someone offered me a drink, but I don’t think I’m there yet.",9,1756560392.0,stopdrinking,3,1.0,False

1n41ls6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kolkatacity/comments/1n41ls6/kolkata_is_too_cheap_for_its_own_good/,Kolkata is too cheap for its own good,"Kolkata, the “City of Joy,” is dirt-cheap, and that’s exactly why it’s drowning in its own filth. Yeah, I said it. The low cost of living here isn’t a flex—it’s a curse. It’s turning Kolkata into a cesspool, and if we don’t jack up prices, this city’s going to end up looking like the backwaters of some underdeveloped African country. Controversial? Good. Let’s talk.
Auto fares? A measly 10-20 bucks for a shared ride. Bus fares? You can cross half the city for less than a Starbucks coffee. Street food? A plate of puchka or a roll for 20-30 bucks. And don’t get me started on the booze—cheap daaru flows like the Ganges. Sounds great, right? Wrong. This dirt-cheap lifestyle is why Kolkata’s stuck in a rut. When everything costs peanuts, people have zero motivation to hustle. Why grind for extra cash when you can live like a king on pocket change? This isn’t progress—it’s stagnation. It’s why the streets are littered with garbage, the infrastructure’s crumbling, and half the city looks like it’s stuck in the 90s.
Compare that to, say, Mumbai or Bangalore. You think people there are okay with mediocrity? No, because living in those cities costs an arm and a leg, so people hustle, innovate, and demand better. In Kolkata, cheap food, cheap transport, and cheap alcohol breed complacency. It’s no different from some underdeveloped African nations where low costs keep people trapped in a cycle of just getting by, with no push for growth or ambition. Harsh? Maybe, but look around—Kolkata’s roads are choked with garbage, hawkers clog every corner, and public transport is a circus. Low prices are enabling this mess.
Here’s the fix: raise the minimum cost of everything. Street food? Nothing less than 50 bucks a plate. Auto and bus fares? Start at 50 bucks a ride, minimum. Force people to feel the pinch. When costs are low, there’s no incentive to maintain quality or cleanliness—vendors cut corners, drivers overload buses, and the city pays the price. Higher prices would push vendors to up their game, force the government to fix public transport, and make people work harder to afford a better life. It’s basic economics: scarcity drives ambition, ambition drives progress. If we keep letting Kolkata be a cheap free-for-all, it’ll turn into a complete dump, if it hasn’t already.
I know what you’re thinking: “But what about the poor?” Look, I’m not saying screw the poor, but enabling a system where everyone’s okay with bare minimums isn’t helping anyone. Higher costs would push investment into better infrastructure, cleaner streets, and a city that doesn’t look like it’s perpetually stuck in a budget crisis. Kolkata deserves better than being India’s bargain-bin city. Let’s stop romanticizing “cheap” and start demanding a city that’s worth living in.

1n41lpv,https://www.reddit.com/r/ouraring/comments/1n41lpv/yes_i_have_concerns/,Yes I have concerns,"Long time customer, security Nerd and privacy advocate.

I’ve seen the Palantir news and also the CEO response. Please forgive my rant… this goes broader and been coming a while. 

So I love what my Oura Ring does for my wellness but as a cybersecurity professional, I’m losing sleep (ironically) over thinking about the current privacy and security safeguards in place. We’re talking no multi-factor authentication just single use email codes, no app lock, no “private encryption mode” for sensitive health data, no session audit managements, no trust centre for data protection, basically just simple user-level protections. In 2025, that’s a tough one. My coffee rewards web app has 2FA, but Oura? Nope. Oura’s own site preaches about encryption and AWS servers yet they skip measures like two-factor auth. It’s like they built a high-tech vault and left the key on the mat. It all about risk balance and user experience but as this company grows so should its security measures.

And yes, the recent Palantir partnership is a big part of what kicked all this off in my head. While some users are fixating on the name alone, the real issue is what we’re not being told. Any time a company handling large volumes of personal data partners with a third party especially one with deep roots in government, AI, and defence analytics the burden of transparency skyrockets. We need to know exactly what data Palantir can access, whether it’s identifiable, what it’s used for, how it’s secured, and whether we can opt out. These aren’t wild demands they’re basic expectations in a post-GDPR world (which I cover later) The risk isn’t just misuse; it’s that once access is granted, data can propagate through multiple unseen layers: vendors, contractors, algorithms, even unintended systems. And if there’s no way for the user to verify or control that, it’s not privacy it’s faith-based data handling. That’s not good enough when the data in question is this personal.

Oura allows us access to our data on the web, but provides no audit trail or session logs we can see. If someone logs into your Oura account behind your back, you’ll never know. No notification, no list of active sessions, nothing. In an age of constant credential-stuffing attacks, this is a huge red flag. (Remember, 23andMe had 7M users data scraped last year via reused logins exactly what 2FA and login alerts help prevent). If an attacker guesses or steals your Oura password, they could quietly siphon off your most personal health info and you’d be none the wiser. Oura basically expects us to blindly trust that their backend security will never fail. As any security person will tell you: trust is not a security strategy. I am sure they will most certainly do security assurance, pen test platforms and have (hopefully) a well rehearsed incident response response team proactively looking at each attack lifecycle against their platform. But… cyber attacks and breaches are a WHEN not an IF.

I’m in the EU, so I exercised my GDPR rights to see what Oura has on me. They sent me a data dump (raw sensor readings, profile info, etc) but nowhere did it list which third-party companies had processed my data, or for what purpose. Under GDPR’s spirit, I should at least know if, say, some analytics vendor or cloud subprocessors handled my info. Oura provided zero insight there just the data itself. They might argue that’s “compliant”, but it sure isn’t transparent. If Oura truly cared about privacy, they’d be upfront about who touches our data and why. Instead, it’s a black box.

Some folks might say, “Who’d hack a sleep tracker? What’s the worst that could happen?” Unfortunately, health and wellness data are valuable and sensitive and breaches are happening all around us. EG MyFitnessPal app got 150 million accounts hacked. A UK telehealth app had a bug where users accidentally saw 50 videos of other peoples private doctor consultations. A popular period tracker shared users intimate health details with Facebook and Google for ads despite promising privacy. Even Peloton left an API flaw that exposed any user’s age, weight, workout info, even if profiles were set private. These aren’t sci-fi scenarios; they’re real incidents from the past few years. Now imagine the potential fallout if Oura which knows your sleep patterns, heart rate, body temperature trends, menstrual cycle hints, even potential pregnancy had a similar breach or misuse. In the wrong hands, that data could be used for blackmail, identity theft, stalking or profiling. And in some jurisdictions, personal health data leaks can literally put lives at risk it’s not just about embarrassment; it’s about safety.

Security is not lip service in 2025. Any tech product especially one dealing with sensitive health metrics should follow the highest principles. That means baking in protections early instead of saying “the protection of your personal data is of paramount importance to us,” In practice, I see a lot of security theater and not enough real safeguards. Yes, Oura encrypts data on their servers and complies with GDPR on paper. Good. But there is so much you can do to improve security, transparency and privacy. We’re just supposed to trust Oura’s opaque assurances. That’s the opposite of “zero trust” – it’s 100% trust in a single point of failure. Please offer more.

To be clear, I’m calling this out because I love what the Oura Ring offers and the insights it gives me. I don’t want to give it up. Oura is a juicy target – a growing company sitting on troves of personal health data. Breaches, insider abuse, third-party leaks, infrastructure hacks these happen routinely across tech. Maybe Oura’s security team is top-notch behind the scenes, but without user-visible protections, it’s like having a state-of-the-art alarm system that the homeowner isn’t allowed to use or even see.

Bottom Line: Oura needs to implement better account security (MFA, login alerts, device management). Give us the ability to lock down our app or hide sensitive metrics when needed. Be transparent about data flows if you claim to prioritise privacy, prove it with details and user controls, not just PR statements. And that makes this security nerd very uneasy. I’m curious if others here feel the same way am I overreacting, or do you also expect better from a company that literally tracks our heartbeats?

(Dry humor footnote: If I suddenly start getting “targeted” ads for sleep meds or pregnancy tests, I’ll know my Oura data fell into the wrong hands…)

1n41l4t,https://www.reddit.com/r/GearShifted/comments/1n41l4t/explore_the_best_hybrid_bike_for_women/,Explore the Best Hybrid Bike for Women Sixthreezero Review Guide,"Rolling up to the park on the sixthreezero 630034 EVRYjourney felt like stepping into a lifestyle magazine. This women's beach cruiser bike truly lives up to its name, blending style, functionality, and comfort seamlessly. Over the past few weeks, I’ve put this beauty through its paces during daily commutes, weekend leisure rides, and even a few urban coffee shop stops. While it has impressed me in many ways, there are still a few details worth noting for anyone considering this hybrid bicycle.

**Design and Aesthetic Appeal**  
The swooping aluminum frame is an absolute showstopper. It turns heads effortlessly, especially in its cream color paired with brown leather-looking grips and a matching seat. The meticulous stitching detail on the grips and seat adds a vintage yet refined touch. Its step-through frame design not only makes getting on and off ridiculously easy but also gives it a laid-back, casual vibe perfect for cruising. I personally find the whitewall semi-slick tires particularly charming—they scream retro elegance without trying too hard.

**Comfort Features for Every Ride**  
I’ve had a few bikes in the past where riding for more than half an hour felt like a punishment for my lower back and shoulders. Not this one. The foot-forward seat and pedal positioning deliver an upright riding posture that kept back strain at bay, even during longer rides. The dual-spring saddle offers extra cushion, which my partner even commented on when trying it. It almost feels custom-fitted for my 5’6” frame, though shorter friends who borrowed it also praised the adjustability. 

**Highlights**  
- The step-through aluminum frame makes mounting and dismounting hassle-free.  
- Shimano 7-speed system ensures smooth shifting for diverse terrains.  
- Wide 2-inch tires provide stability and roll seamlessly on different surfaces.  

[See sixthreezero 630034 EVRYjourney deals on Amazon now.](https://rulse.com/p/b00akibr40/)

**Performance and Usability**  
I wasn’t sure how versatile something marketed as a ""cruiser"" could be, but it turns out it delivers more than expected. The Shimano 7-speed external derailleur impressed me—it transitioned smoothly whether I was tackling a slight hill, zipping through city traffic, or cruising at a leisurely pace along a beachfront. I wouldn’t call it a performance monster for competitive cyclists, but for someone who enjoys a practical, stylish ride, it’s spot-on. 

The brakes also deserve a mention. Pairing front and rear handbrakes made me feel safe darting around unexpected street obstacles—a squirrel encounter comes to mind here—and offered reliable stopping power in wet conditions too. While the absence of a suspension might deter hardcore trail enthusiasts, the rigid frame is excellent for paved areas or smooth trails.

**Pluses**  
- Leather-stitched grips and seat combine style with functionality.  
- Rear rack is perfect for adding panniers or baskets if you need to carry extras.  
- Requires minimal maintenance thanks to its well-built parts.  

**Less Favorable Aspects**  
Admittedly, there were a few hurdles that made me raise an eyebrow or two.  
- Assembly was a bit trickier than the 80% assembled promise had me believe, especially aligning the front brakes.  
- Weighing in at around 18 kg, it can feel heavy for those who need to lug it upstairs regularly.  
- The kickstand, while functional, seems slightly flimsy and could use a sturdier build.  

**Industry Competitors**  
Comparing this with something like Schwinn Discover isn’t entirely fair—they cater to overlapping yet slightly different users. Schwinn’s models often feel bulkier and less chic, good if you’re prioritizing rugged utility, but they miss the sleek beauty and lightweight feel this bike has. On the flip side, Electra Cruiser bikes come close in terms of visual flair, but when you stack their pricing and features side-to-side, the sixthreezero offering leaves a stronger impression overall. The fender integration and comfort-focused design are where this bike pulls ahead. 

**True Value**  
Despite the hiccups in assembly and its heavier frame, I feel the features and design justify its price point. It’s a bike that manages to be more functional than a typical cruiser but also doesn’t overwhelm beginners by overpacking features. Compared to alternatives at similar price points, this is a thoughtful buy for those who value comfort as much as style. Every detail, from the aluminum frame to the soft, cushioned saddle, reflects its intention to balance usability with aesthetic pleasure.

Bite of Desire
Lavender meets vanilla, they said. I suspected it to be a dupe of Burberry goddess. First spray most definitely reminded me of it so I sprayed the OG on my other hand to compare. It's definitely similar, maybe 70% alike? My husband thought so too. Bite of desire isn't as vanilla as goddess though. A little bit heavier on lavender and the pink pepper and musk notes definitely set it apart, as compared to the ginger and vanilla heaviness of goddess. It can be worn formally and casually both, in my opinion.

Coffee meets vanilla and chocolate, they said. Nahh mate, this isn't realistic true gourmand. But it definitely is beautiful! Earthy, musky deliciousness. Definitely unisex. But there's something nostalgic about it.. the subtle white floral note, it blooms so beautifully and definitely elevates the scent. Love it! 


Cherry wine
Oooh this one's my favourite! Citrus sweet, they said. They're right. It is Citric, but not enough to be a freshie. You can smell the flowers but it doesn't smell like a floral fragrance either. Sweet for sure. But also smoky. A little earthy, along with that. Overall it is super sophisticated. I even got complimented by my friend on how good I smell when I wore this to hang out with a bunch of friends, and let's just say this particular friend who complimented is someone with an expensive taste. Very pleasant dry down as well. 

Overall performance - Projects well enough, for the first hour and lasts like 5-6 hours maybe. Lasts longer on clothes ofc- got a whiff of it 14 hours later too. Not too bad, eh! I'm quite pleased with this but, honestly. Paying 300 rupees for 100ml each was definitely an unexpected steal. Brownie points for the neat bottle, good atomiser. Bottles are heavier than, say, house of kanzan bottles, so feels kinda premium lol.

1n41i5z,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeLoadout/comments/1n41i5z/could_the_best_builtin_dishwasher_be_the_compact/,Could the best built-in dishwasher be the compact Frigidaire FFBD1831US,"Compact design meets modern functionality in the Frigidaire FFBD1831US dishwasher. As someone who frequently battles post-dinner cleanup and lives in a smaller space, I’ve had my fair share of struggles finding a dishwasher that makes life easier without taking up my entire kitchen. This 18-inch stainless steel model has genuinely impressed me with its thoughtful mix of performance and practicality. Ideal for apartments or households that don’t run dishes for a small crowd, it strikes a sweet spot for those seeking a blend of space-saving design and powerful cleaning. And yes, I tested it enough to give you a full rundown of the quirks and perks.

**Design and Build Quality**  
At a glance, this dishwasher's slim profile and stainless steel finish ooze simplicity and elegance. The 18-inch size strikes the right balance, especially in compact kitchens, without looking like you’ve compromised on aesthetics. With dimensions of 18 x 22.5 x 35 inches, it fits snugly under counters but doesn't feel cramped inside. The stainless steel material isn't just great to look at. It’s also easy to clean and surprisingly resistant to fingerprints. While it weighs 54 pounds, installation was straightforward, though I’d recommend an extra set of hands for initial placement—trust me, balancing it alone isn’t fun.

**Highlights**  
- Dual spray arm system provides an impressively even clean on both racks.  
- Slim yet durable build makes it perfect for apartments or smaller kitchens.  
- ADA compliance ensures accessibility and inclusive design.  
- Energy Star certification helps conserve energy, which was immediately noticeable in my electricity bill.

**Performance and Cleaning Features**  
I was quite skeptical about how well such a compact dishwasher could clean, given its size. But after tossing everything into it—greasy pans, several stained coffee mugs, and those stubborn plates from lasagna night—I was pleasantly surprised. The dual spray arms on the top and bottom racks worked their magic to cover every nook and cranny. It didn't matter if my dishes had sat out longer than they should have; even the sanitize cycle left them sparkling clean.  

Six cleaning cycle options make life easier, including the energy-saver and heavy wash modes. The rinse cycle was a game-changer for lightly soiled items, especially when I needed stuff cleaned quickly. The heated drying system also does a solid job, though if you’re dealing with plastic containers, there may still be some residual droplets. It’s not perfect, but for everyday needs, it works well.

**Good Points**  
- Flexible cleaning options, accommodating different levels of dirtiness.  
- The sanitize cycle is NSF certified, providing the peace of mind that germs are fully dealt with.  
- Quiet operation at 52 dBA means you won’t hear this dishwasher roaring when binge-watching your favorite show nearby.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Though effective, the drying function occasionally struggles with plastics. I had to hand-dry a few items post-cycle.  
- The control panel isn’t particularly intuitive for first-time setup. It took me a couple of cycles to figure out what settings worked best, as the display lacks touchscreen functionality.  
- While interior space is suited for up to 8 place settings, the racks feel a bit cramped when loading larger pots or oddly shaped items.  

**Competitors**  
When I compared this to other compact dishwashers like the Bosch 300 Series or Whirlpool’s 18-inch model, the Frigidaire easily holds its own in some aspects, while conceding in others. The Bosch offerings tend to have slightly quieter operation and a sleeker interface, but they also come with a higher price tag. Whirlpool provides comparable cleaning cycles but lacks the same level of energy efficiency. Where the Frigidaire excels is its ability to deliver reliable performance in an ADA-compliant, cost-effective package.  

**Value for Money**  
Evaluating the features versus what you’d pay for other comparable compact dishwashers, this product is well worth the consideration. It hits most of the performance marks while keeping its price lean. The energy efficiency itself could save you a noticeable amount of money in operational costs over time. While it’s not flawless, it provides a reliable and commendable performance for its category.

*Where hope meets humidity in Nationals Park*

The Washington Nationals (53-81), fresh off a six-game losing streak that could make a zen master reach for Xanax, host the Tampa Bay Rays (65-69) on August 30, 2025. This isn’t just a game—it’s a gladiatorial contest where the Nationals are the overcooked pasta and the Rays are the fork. Let’s dissect this matchup with the precision of a surgeon and the humor of a stand-up comic who’s had one too many espresso shots.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why Your Grandma Knows the Rays Are Favored

The Rays enter as **-152 favorites**, implying bookmakers think they’ve got a **60% chance to win** (thanks to that 150/(150+100) formula we all *love*). The Nationals, at **+125**, have a **45.5% implied probability**—not terrible for underdogs, but not exactly a “buy a lottery ticket” scenario.

Statistically, the Rays are the more well-rounded team. Their **3.97 ERA** (16th in MLB) is a cozy blanket compared to Washington’s **5.39 ERA** (29th, or “open invitation” in baseball terms). Tampa’s pitching staff also sports an **8.7 K/9** (8th in baseball), while the Nationals’ **1.429 WHIP** (second-worst) suggests their defense communicates like a toddler on a sugar rush.

The starters? **Ryan Pepiot** (3.82 ERA, 149 K) for Tampa is a steadier hand than a coffee shop barista on a Monday morning. **Jake Irvin** (5.40 ERA, 1.429 WHIP) for Washington? He’s the guy who trips over his own shoelaces while trying to tie them.

---

### News Digest: Caminero Shines, Nationals Stumble

The Rays’ **Junior Caminero** (.257 AVG, 39 HR, 94 RBI) is the team’s golden goose, but let’s be real—he’s just here for the free peanuts. Tampa’s offense isn’t blowing anyone away (17th in HRs, 15th in runs), but their **.251 team average** and **4th-best WHIP** mean they’re disciplined like a monk on a juice cleanse.

The Nationals? They’re hitting **.243** (20th) and slugging **.387** (23rd), which is like trying to win a race with a shopping cart. Their **26 HRs from James Wood** are nice, but when your team’s **ERA is 5.39**, you’re not winning with offense—you’re losing with pitching. Oh,

Outside of that, I’m a big fan of manga, the occasional anime, and I’m deep into board games and indie video games. Slay the Spire, Hades, and Fallout: New Vegas are my current favorites. I also like cooking (especially seasonal recipes), baking, dancing, a bit of swimming and being cozy.

1n41ewy,https://i.redd.it/nlrr9665q5mf1.png,The Sphere of Smoke: An Ode to the Last Cigarette,"# 

I have smoked for forty years. Cigarettes, pipes, cigars, even those Russian *primas* — the ten-cent horrors left over from war, hand-rolled and wrapped in nothing but paper and disdain. They were disgusting, but unforgettable. People who have never smoked cannot understand this sphere we inhabit. They see only a line: addiction, poison, weakness. But for those of us inside the circle, smoking is a ritual, a companion, a measure of time itself.

I have shared cigarettes in places that map the arc of my life. On the Trans-Siberian, hurtling across frozen tundra at minus twenty Celsius, I stood in the vestibules with other passengers, smoke blown instantly sideways into the black wind. A thousand cigarettes lit and gone, each one marking another mile across Siberia. I have driven through every American state, each remembered by a cigarette smoked within its borders. And at twenty, a friend and I drove from Vancouver to San Francisco on a whim, only to stand at the Golden Gate Bridge for one cigarette at a rest stop — three minutes of smoke that became the shape of the entire journey.

For non-smokers, this is nonsense. For us, it is the sphere. The ember is not just nicotine; it is ritual and memory condensed. *Mark Twain* knew it when he said, “If smoking is not allowed in heaven, I shall not go.” *Albert Einstein* claimed pipe smoking contributed to “a calm and objective judgment in all human affairs.” *George Sand* called cigars an act of independence. *Balzac* drank oceans of coffee, but swore tobacco “gave the nerves of steel to use the wakefulness.” And *Dostoevsky* himself, a manic chain-smoker, admitted he could calculate more clearly with smoke in his lungs. For him, tobacco was not accessory; it was thought itself.

Smoking is philosophy made tactile. It is not merely an inhalation — it is a gesture. It punctuates conversation. It creates pause in solitude. It binds strangers into momentary fellowship. *Hemingway* insisted that courage was best accompanied by a good cigar. *Camus* wrote of chain-smoking his way through absurdity. *Sartre* declared, “Like a cigarette, life burns quickly — and we are its ashes.” Each drag is a line of poetry written on air.

But smoking is more than gesture — it is time itself, burning. If time is what gives permanence to mass, then a cigarette is the smallest measure of infinity you can hold in your hand. Two or three minutes, a flicker of eternity wrapped in paper. That is why, when men facing a firing squad were offered a last request, so many asked for a cigarette. Not to extend their life, but to mark it. To savor time as flame.

This is the paradox outsiders will never grasp: a cigarette is both fleeting and eternal. Its ember dies even as it gives life to the moment. In that countdown is expansion, the infinity of awareness. That is why soldiers on the front, prisoners in their cells, wanderers on the road all reach for fire. It is not only relief. It is a way of measuring being.

The line-logic of the non-smoker reduces this to numbers — pack-years, carcinogens, mortality tables. But the smoker’s logic is spherical. The cigarette is not addiction alone. It is:

* **Form** — the shape of time visible in smoke rings and ash.
* **Gesture** — ritual pause, camaraderie, memory.
* **Portal** — to spontaneity, to journeys, to freedom.
* **Prayer** — a burning unit of eternity, ephemeral but infinite.

It is no accident that the lit cigarette has been symbol and ritual across centuries. From Dostoevsky’s parlor to the Siberian vestibule, from Hemingway’s Havana to my own Golden Gate drive, the flame carries a lineage.

If I were ever asked for one final wish before death, I would ask for a cigarette. Not because I am addicted. But because those last three minutes would be enough to taste infinity one more time. The smoke would not extend my life. It would complete it.

Looking gives us sight.  
Listening gives us voice.

1n418v7,https://i.redd.it/tkc2o1a9o5mf1.jpeg,What should I do to fix my yellow tooth?,"Apologies in advance for the length of this post.

This is a 42-year old set of teeth. 3 total cavities. Pretty healthy teeth in general. I don't drink alcohol or smoke, but in recent years my coffee and diet soda habit has been gross.

At age 17 I developed an access. My theory will always be that I broke the root of my tooth getting hit in the face with my trumpet in marching band while wearing braces. Got the necessary root canals to get rid of the infection.

Age 19 tooth was looking pretty brown, went in for a round of internal whitening.

Age 23-24 developed a bump on my gum and went to an endodontist for another root canal.

Age 31 a heroic dentist took on the challenge of my yellow tooth. I think we maybe did 7 rounds of internal bleaching. I'd hop in the chair for 15 minutes and he'd swap things out. It got to maybe more of a light, bright neon yellow when we decided that's as good as it would get.

Now I am just tired of seeing my yellow tooth in pictures or glimpsing it when I'm on camera at work.

I'd love to hear your opinions on:
   -More internal/external bleaching
   -A crown
   -An implant
   -What to ask about!

Relevant dental info:
-Most dentists and the endodontist said, based on x-rays, that the root of my tooth had been broken. A maxillofacial surgeon I saw for an implant consult (almost 20 years ago) said he thought it was just the anatomy of the tooth (can't remember exact phrasing).
-My current dentist and a previous dentist who consulted a different endodontist think the tooth is stable enough for a crown (again, I may not be phrasing it the way they did).
-I was told when I was much younger that an implant would give me the most natural results.
-The tooth causes mild pain sometimes, but my dentist doesn't see anything wrong.
-My current dentist seems to think the crown is a better option, but this is why  I'm here. I had always thought one day I'd go with the implant for the most natural results.

At eighteen he struck for America, hungry for fortune. On the East Coast he made one in trade, then lost it just as fast. But instead of crawling home, Reese rolled up his sleeves and built it again, tougher than before.

He drifted into the raw Minnesota Territory, where land was cheap, winters were cruel, and men settled arguments with fists or pistols. Reese learned quick, speculating in property until folks called him shrewd, hard, and lucky.

By 1848 he caught the scent of bigger game: California. San Francisco was still a frontier town, all mud, shacks, and gold-hungry drifters. Reese laid down about $120,000 in land—a king’s ransom in those days. He was staking his claim not with pick and shovel, but deeds and titles. The sheriff himself would call him into a posse when troublemakers needed chasing down, for Reese had a reputation—steady nerves, sharp eyes, and not afraid to stand his ground. Then came the great fire of 1851, a roaring hell that leveled most of the city and near ruined him. Yet Reese was made of ironwood: he rose from the ashes, fought his way back, and before long was the second-largest landholder in San Francisco.

But here’s the rub: for all his wealth, Reese was tighter than a drum. He’d walk for hours rather than spend five cents on a streetcar, and at Saulman’s Coffee Salon he’d point to the crumbs on the counter instead of ordering a full plate. The stories grew taller with each telling—some say he even dropped dead back home in Wallerstein when pressed for a tip at the cemetery gate.

Still, a man’s legacy ain’t just his quirks. Reese carried a streak of duty alongside his stinginess. In 1873 he funded the purchase of Professor Lieber’s grand library for the University of California. And when he died in 1878, he left a fortune near ten million dollars, a hefty share marked for good works. His name lived on through charities, and the Michael Reese Hospital in Chicago stood as a monument to his unlikely generosity for nearly a century.

From a penniless Bavarian boy to one of San Francisco’s great land barons, Michael Reese’s life was proof that the Wild West was no place for the faint-hearted—only for those stubborn enough to lose it all twice, and still come back swingin’.

*By Your Humorously Analytical AI Sportswriter*

---

**Parsing the Odds: The Math of Misery and Mayhem**  
Let’s crunch the numbers like a Bundesliga defender crumbles under a Red Bull Leipzig counterattack. The odds tell a stark tale: **RB Leipzig** is the 1.43/1.45 favorite (-145 American odds), implying a **59-60% chance to win**. Meanwhile, **1. FC Heidenheim** is a +5.5 to +5.9 underdog (15-16% implied probability), with the draw hovering around 19-21%.

Translation? Bookmakers think Leipzig’s chances are as certain as a German engineer’s coffee break at 3 p.m. Heidenheim? They’re the sportsbook’s version of a “long shot,” statistically more likely to serve as a plot device for a dramatic upset than to actually… well, win.

---

**Digesting the News: Post-Defeat Psychosis**  
Both teams are reeling from brutal openers. Leipzig was **6-0’d by Bayern Munich**—a result so惨 that even the goalposts probably needed therapy. Heidenheim fared slightly better, losing 3-1 to Wolfsburg, which is like losing a race to a tortoise that forgot it was racing… until the finish line texted them.

No major injury updates here, but let’s speculate: Could Leipzig’s defense be suffering from *Bayern Trauma Syndrome*? Are Heidenheim’s players still psychologically scarred by Wolfsburg’s third goal? Only time will tell, but Leipzig’s squad—Red Bull’s well-oiled German engineering marvel—should bounce back faster than a trampoline in a bungee-jumping competition.

1n41481,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeRigged/comments/1n41481/find_out_if_the_best_countertop_water_filter/,Find Out if the Best Countertop Water Filter PHILIPS Lives Up to the Hype,"The Philips ADD5930BK is currently one of the best countertop water filtering solutions I've had the pleasure of trying out. Granted, I’m a bit of a stickler for filtered water—who isn’t after tasting the difference in purified versus regular tap? This model brings serious weight to the table—figuratively and literally—and manages to create an impressive balance between portability, advanced filtration capability, and sleek design. After weeks of daily use, here's what stood out to me.

**Compact and Smart Design**

The water filter’s compact nature surprised me, especially given its high-powered functionality. At 13.2 inches long, 5 inches wide, and 14 inches tall, it fits nicely into spaces usually dominated by coffee makers or juicers. I’ve tested it on my kitchen counter, in a friend’s dorm kitchenette, and even placed it on my office work table, and it integrated seamlessly everywhere. The sleek black finish somehow manages to stay fingerprint-resistant (a miracle for a mom with twins constantly running their hands over everything). It carries an air of modern sophistication while maintaining practicality.

**Ease of Use**

It’s exceptionally user-friendly, right out of the box. Unlike many filtration systems that demand plumbing installations or special tools, there’s none of that drama here. You just plug it in, press a button, and voilà—fresh drinking water. The water dispenser has a consistent output of 16.9 ounces per button press, which is perfect for filling up my reusable bottles or a kitchen jug in seconds. This button press design eliminates the guesswork, and let’s be honest, it gives me the tiniest feeling of being fancy. 

**[Check Philips ADD5930BK price on Amazon.](https://raifords.com/p/b0d8cp1yth/)**

**Aquaporin Technology with NASA Backing**

One feature that truly distinguishes this model is the integration of Aquaporin Inside technology. NASA apparently tested this for use in space missions, which is intriguing (who wouldn’t trust astronauts?). It’s gratifying to know the same level of precision used for space is, quite literally, in my kitchen. This five-stage filtration system impressively reduces TDS, lead, calcium, and other impurities, offering water that not only tastes cleaner but is healthier too. During my usage period, I tested it with questionable tap water during a camping trip, and the taste difference was night and day.

**Advantages**

- Tested NASA-grade Aquaporin technology for unparalleled purity
- Compact and attractive design that suits home, office, or dorm spaces  
- Convenient and instant filtration at the press of a button  
- No plumbing installation required—plug and play  

**Critiques**

- Bulky for actual travel or frequently moving it (not exactly ""portable"")  
- Replacement filters, though durable, could prove costly over time  
- Initial investment price might feel steep compared to simpler pitchers  

**Practical Features That Make a Difference**

I’m all for efficiency, and this product nails the small details. The filter lifetime indicator is especially helpful—I tend to lose track of such things—but knowing exactly when to replace the filter ensures consistent water quality. The nine-cup detachable reservoir makes refilling an absolute breeze. Also, and this might sound trivial, but the inclusion of a reusable high-quality glass bottle is delightful. Always helpful for refrigerating cold water during summer afternoons!

**Product Rivals**

Comparing this system to competitors like the Brita UltraMax and APEC countertop RO systems, the Philips ADD5930BK stands tall with its superior build quality and Aquaporin technology. While Brita offers a more budget-friendly approach, its results pale in terms of advanced filtration. The APEC unit, on the other hand, has similar filtration power but requires more complex installation. The ADD5930BK manages to stick somewhere in the middle with its plug-and-play approach without compromising on purification.

In terms of drawbacks, Brita filters are easier and cheaper to replace, while Philips filters might demand a slightly heavier investment with time. APEC systems also tend to last a bit longer between cycles, particularly for heavyweight users. However, the smaller footprint of this model makes it a winner for anyone short on counter space.

**Smart Spending**

Given the advanced features like its Aquaporin technology, compact dimensions, and reliability, the cost feels justified for what you receive. Think of it as a combined investment in health and convenience. That said, if you're already accustomed to standalone pitchers or faucet filters, the upfront pricing might feel less affordable. Still, if you're keeping an eye on long-term benefits and environmental impact (think reduced use of plastic bottles!), then this becomes a truly sensible purchase.

Honestly, I see ArrowHead making a lot of the same mistakes that SOE -> Daybreak Games -> Rogue Planet Games made. Unless some serious changes are made in the development team's headspace, the game is going to choke itself to death.   
  
The QA team hasn't pulled their own weight once. Not a single patch was pushed out without major problems: audio channels randomly muting, guns not firing, Quasar eternal charge, Autocannon reload bug, zombie enemies, gas and fire not working (multiple times), snake-divers, spawn issues, stealth not working, suppressors doing nothing, desync-divers, enemies walking through terrain (since launch), enemies shooting through themselves and terrain (since launch), failed reloads with loss of ammo, ragdoll glitches, clipping through terrain, and thats just what I can remember early in the morning without my coffee.  
  
The balance / game design teams seem radically disconnected from the community at-large. This is made especially obvious with the ""bugfixes"" regarding status effects and melee combat. Status effects were a mixed bag with gas being too strong (being both the best CC and anti-chaff in the entire game), fire was well-balanced, stun was near-irrelevant, and stagger was situationally useful. Now, gas turns off if too many enemies are affected by it, fire doesn't hurt enemies that walk over it (only Helldivers), stun breakpoints usually take effect after the enemy would already be dead, and stagger is still situational. We really can't even evaluate the full damage of the status effect nerfs due to the long-lasting bugs.  
Melee combat was already non-viable at higher difficulties, but removing their ability to bypass armor killed the playstyle. Most enemies have some form of higher armor, and being unable to accurately target weakpoints like guns are able to makes melee impossible to use against most foes.  
Another disconnect is the One True Flag, which is a worse version of the stun lance. There was lots of opportunity for making it a support item that buffed allies within a range, but no. That was deemed too unrealistic - just ignore the ability to survive a nuke if you flip a coin the right way, or being able to survive exsanguination and repair broken bones with Super Meth.  
Most weapons, grenades, strategems, armor passives, and boosters are directly outclassed by other picks; instead of being viable sidegrades. And a third of the boosters are downgrades/troll picks that would rightfully get the user kicked for bringing them. The Urchin is only useful for trolling after its nerf.  
Enemy design has been terrible for the last few enemies. Leviathans are still entirety contrary to the established Illuminate gameplay design (they fit better as Bot enemies) and were released with ragdoll lasers. (Didn't you guys learn your lesson regarding ragdoll lasers after the emergency rollback of the Hulk variant that did that?) Speaking of ragdoll lasers: War Striders... why? You know why that wasn't going to go over well. Heavy enemies with no weakpoint go against Bot design (put a heatsync on their lower back, below the grenade mortars), and the thrice-dammed ragdoll lasers are back. C'mon guys, it's not that hard to learn things. Even goldfish can learn!
  
The technical side of the game is in shambles. I know more than a few people that had components of their PC builds bricked by Gameguard after the last patch. Divers are crashing out of the game at an average rate of 1 crash every 5 minutes. Stuttering, freezing, crashing, muting,  and hardware failure are all commonplace, even on 'set' hardware like on consoles. This should be a top priority. It's like power companies ignoring disconnected, broken, and split power lines to build more generators. The game itself is a medium to get your products (warbonds and SC purchases) to your customers. If the game doesn't work, how are we expected to use your product?
  
I have to give props where they're due: the origional team that worked on the game before release did a great job. The game was incredibly stable and efficient, fun and challenging. While weapon balance was cooked, it was actually better than what we have now in terms of power discrepancy. The team currently running the game is only operating a managed decline.  
And the art team is doing a fantastic job. My only complaints for them are the odd obsession with performance-damaging fog, and refusing to use stable color palettes that allow for easy uniform swapping without clashing color schemes.  
  
Anyway, get the whole AH team on a player-focused mindset or so many of us will be out on another one of our favorite games.",2,1756558931.0,Helldivers,15,0.52,False

# The Psychology Behind Influencer Marketing Success

What makes influencer marketing so incredibly powerful? It's simple – trust.

Think about it: Would you rather trust a faceless corporation or someone you've been following for months, whose morning coffee routine you know by heart? Exactly.

Influencer marketing bridges that trust gap between brands and consumers. It's like having a friend recommend a restaurant versus seeing a billboard on the highway. Which one would make you actually visit?

Content creators have already done the heavy lifting – they've built authentic relationships with their audiences. When they share your product or service, they're essentially lending you their credibility. It's relationship marketing at its finest.

But here's where it gets interesting: influencers don't just promote products; they humanize brands. They show real people using real solutions to solve real problems. That's storytelling gold right there.

The relationship dynamic works both ways too. You're not just leveraging the connection between influencer and follower – you're building a bridge between your brand and the influencer community. Smart brands understand this creates a ripple effect that extends far beyond a single post.

# Why Instagram Dominates the Influencer Marketing Landscape

Let's talk numbers for a second. Instagram boasts over 2 billion monthly active users. That's not just a statistic – that's 2 billion potential customers waiting to discover your brand.

But raw numbers don't tell the whole story. Instagram's evolution from a simple photo-sharing app to a comprehensive business platform makes it the perfect influencer marketing playground.

## The Instagram Marketing Arsenal

Instagram didn't become the influencer marketing king by accident. The platform packed its arsenal with business-focused features that make collaboration seamless:

**Analytics That Actually Matter:** Instagram Insights transforms guesswork into data-driven decisions. You can track everything from audience demographics to peak activity times, content performance metrics, and engagement patterns. It's like having a crystal ball for your marketing strategy.

**Stories That Sell:** These 24-hour snapshots create urgency while maintaining authenticity. Stories appear at the top of feeds, grabbing immediate attention. Plus, they offer interactive elements that boost engagement – polls, questions, swipe-up links, and more.

**Collaboration Made Easy:** The Collabs feature revolutionized partnerships by allowing co-authored content. Both accounts share the likes, comments, and views, essentially doubling your reach with a single post.

**Partnership Tools:** Instagram's branded content features streamline influencer collaborations with clear partnership labels, commerce integration, and performance tracking. It's a one-stop shop for authentic brand partnerships.

These features aren't just nice-to-haves – they're game-changers that make Instagram the ultimate influencer marketing platform.

## The Instagram Advantage

Here's what sets Instagram apart from other social platforms:

**Visual storytelling reigns supreme.** Humans process visual information 60,000 times faster than text. Instagram leverages this psychological fact beautifully.

**Engagement rates that matter.** Instagram consistently outperforms other platforms in meaningful interactions between brands and consumers.

**Diverse content formats.** Posts, Stories, Reels, IGTV, Live videos – multiple ways to connect with audiences means multiple opportunities for authentic partnerships.

**Shopping integration.** The platform seamlessly blends content discovery with purchase decisions, shortening the customer journey significantly.

# Mastering Instagram Influencer Campaign Types

Not all influencer campaigns are created equal. Understanding the different types helps you choose the right strategy for your specific goals.

## Sponsored Content That Converts

Sponsored posts remain the bread and butter of influencer marketing. But here's the twist – the best sponsored content doesn't feel sponsored at all.

Successful sponsored posts blend seamlessly into an influencer's regular content style. They tell stories, solve problems, and provide genuine value to the audience. The product placement feels natural, not forced.

Think of it like product placement in movies. When done well, you barely notice it. When done poorly, it pulls you right out of the story.

The secret sauce? Give influencers creative freedom while providing clear brand guidelines. They know their audience better than anyone – trust their expertise.

## Authentic Product Reviews

Product reviews tap into our fundamental desire for social proof. We want to know what others think before making decisions.

Unboxing videos and first-time user experiences create authentic moments that resonate with audiences. There's something magical about watching someone discover a product for the first time.

But here's the catch – authentic reviews come with risks. Some influencers might genuinely dislike your product. That's actually a good thing. Honest reviews build credibility, and constructive criticism helps you improve.

Pro tip: Choose influencers whose values align with your brand, and you'll minimize negative review risks while maximizing authentic enthusiasm.

## Giveaways That Build Communities

Who doesn't love free stuff? Giveaway campaigns create excitement, boost engagement, and rapidly expand your follower base.

But the best giveaways do more than just generate numbers – they build communities. Smart brands use giveaways to introduce their products to new audiences while encouraging user-generated content.

The magic happens when giveaway participants start creating their own content around your brand. Suddenly, you've got dozens of micro-influencers spreading your message organically.

## Product Collaborations That Last

Co-creating products with influencers takes partnership to the next level. It's not just about promotion – it's about genuine collaboration that benefits everyone involved.

These partnerships work best when influencers have deep expertise in your product category. Their input creates better products while their endorsement carries authentic weight.

Think of it as the difference between renting a spokesperson and finding a true brand advocate. The investment is higher, but the returns compound over time.

## Brand Ambassadorships That Pay Off

Long-term brand ambassadorships create consistency and deeper relationships. Instead of one-off posts, ambassadors integrate your brand into their ongoing content strategy.

This approach builds familiarity with audiences over time. Repeated exposure increases brand recall and trust. It's the difference between a casual acquaintance and a close friend.

Brand ambassadors also provide ongoing feedback about your products and market trends. They become valuable assets beyond just promotion.

## Account Takeovers That Engage

Account takeovers offer fresh perspectives and behind-the-scenes content that keeps audiences engaged. They're like guest hosting on a talk show – bringing new energy to your brand's voice.

Successful takeovers require high trust levels and clear guidelines. But when done right, they create memorable content that showcases your brand's personality.

The key is choosing influencers whose style complements your brand while offering something unique to your audience.

# Building Your Instagram Influencer Marketing Strategy

Creating an effective influencer marketing strategy requires more than just finding popular accounts and sending DMs. It's about building a systematic approach that delivers measurable results.

## Setting SMART Goals That Matter

Your influencer marketing goals should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound. Vague objectives like ""increase brand awareness"" won't cut it.

Instead, aim for concrete targets: ""Increase website traffic from Instagram by 25% within three months"" or ""Generate 500 new email subscribers through influencer partnerships by quarter-end.""

Clear goals help you choose the right influencers, create appropriate campaigns, and measure success accurately. They also help influencers understand what success looks like for your partnership.

## Finding Your Perfect Influencer Match

The influencer landscape spans five distinct categories based on follower count:

**Nano-influencers (1,000-10,000 followers):** High engagement rates, niche audiences, affordable partnerships
**Micro-influencers (10,000-50,000 followers):** Strong community connections, specialized expertise, cost-effective reach
**Mid-tier influencers (50,000-500,000 followers):** Broader reach, professional content creation, moderate investment
**Macro-influencers (500,000-1 million followers):** Significant reach, established personal brands, higher costs
**Mega-influencers (1+ million followers):** Maximum reach, celebrity status, premium pricing

But follower count isn't everything. The right influencer for your brand depends on audience alignment, engagement quality, content style, and authenticity.

## The Three R's of Influencer Selection

Use this framework to evaluate potential partners:

**Reach:** Can they connect with your target audience effectively?
**Relevance:** Does their content align with your brand values and industry?
**Relationship:** Do they maintain authentic connections with their followers?

The sweet spot lies where all three R's intersect. High reach without relevance wastes money. Relevance without relationship lacks impact. Relationship without reach limits growth.

## Crafting Irresistible Outreach

Your initial outreach message determines whether influencers ignore your proposal or jump at the opportunity to collaborate.

Successful outreach messages share common elements:

**Personalization:** Show you actually follow their content
**Value proposition:** Explain what's in it for them
**Clear expectations:** Outline deliverables and compensation
**Professional tone:** Maintain respect while being approachable
**Easy response:** Make saying yes simple

Avoid generic copy-paste messages. Influencers receive dozens of partnership requests daily. Personalized outreach stands out immediately.

## Building Genuine Relationships

The best influencer partnerships feel like friendships rather than transactions. Invest time in getting to know your partners beyond their follower counts.

Engage with their content regularly. Share their posts (when appropriate). Provide value even when you're not actively collaborating. These relationship-building activities create loyalty that transcends individual campaigns.

Remember: Influencers have choices. They'll prioritize brands that treat them as partners rather than advertising channels.

## Creating Collaborative Campaign Briefs

Effective campaign briefs balance brand requirements with creative freedom. Include essential information while leaving room for influencer creativity:

**Campaign objectives and key messages**
**Content requirements and deliverables**
**Timeline and posting schedule**
**Legal requirements and FTC guidelines**
**Brand assets and approved hashtags**
**Creative guidelines and inspiration**

But here's the crucial part: Don't micromanage the creative process. Influencers know their audiences better than you do. Trust their expertise while maintaining brand consistency.

# Tracking, Measuring, and Optimizing Performance

What gets measured gets improved. Instagram influencer marketing requires systematic tracking to optimize performance and maximize ROI.

## Essential Metrics to Monitor

Track metrics that align with your campaign goals:

**Reach and impressions:** How many people saw your message?
**Engagement rates:** Are audiences interacting with content?
**Click-through rates:** Is content driving traffic to your website?
**Conversion rates:** Are visitors becoming customers?
**Brand mention sentiment:** What are people saying about your brand?
**Follower growth:** Are you attracting new audiences?

Different campaign types require different metric priorities. Brand awareness campaigns focus on reach and impressions. Sales campaigns prioritize clicks and conversions.

## Tools for Streamlined Management

Managing multiple influencer relationships can become overwhelming without proper tools. Several platforms simplify the process:

**Discovery platforms** help identify potential partners based on audience demographics, engagement rates, and content quality.

**Relationship management tools** streamline communication, contract management, and payment processing.

**Analytics dashboards** consolidate performance data across multiple campaigns and platforms.

**Content approval systems** ensure brand compliance while maintaining efficiency.

While these tools add value, they also add costs. Evaluate whether the time savings justify the investment for your specific needs.

# Understanding Influencer Compensation Models

Influencer compensation varies dramatically based on multiple factors. Understanding these variables helps you budget effectively and negotiate fairly.

## Factors Affecting Influencer Rates

**Follower count:** Larger audiences command higher rates
**Engagement quality:** High engagement often costs more than high follower counts
**Content type:** Video content typically costs more than static images
**Usage rights:** Extended usage or exclusivity increases rates
**Industry expertise:** Specialized knowledge commands premium pricing
**Geographic location:** Market maturity affects standard rates
**Campaign complexity:** Elaborate productions require higher compensation
**Timeline urgency:** Rush jobs cost more
**Platform exclusivity:** Multi-platform campaigns offer volume discounts

## The ""One Cent Per Follower"" Starting Point

Many marketers use the ""one cent per follower"" rule as a baseline for sponsored posts. A 50,000-follower account might charge around $500 per post.

But this rule only provides a starting point. Adjust based on engagement rates, content quality, and campaign requirements. High-engagement micro-influencers often deliver better ROI than low-engagement macro-influencers despite higher per-follower costs.

## Alternative Compensation Models

Cash isn't the only way to compensate influencers:

**Product exchanges:** Suitable for newer influencers building portfolios
**Affiliate commissions:** Performance-based compensation aligns incentives
**Exclusive access:** VIP treatment and early product access add value
**Long-term partnerships:** Volume discounts for ongoing relationships
**Revenue sharing:** Higher risk, higher reward models for confident brands

Mix and match compensation types to create attractive packages that work within your budget constraints.

## Budget Planning Strategies

Influencer marketing budgets should account for more than just influencer fees:

**Content creation costs:** Professional photography, videography, and editing
**Platform management fees:** If using third-party tools
**Legal and contract expenses:** Proper documentation protects everyone
**Performance tracking tools:** Analytics and reporting platforms
**Contingency funds:** Buffer for campaign adjustments or extensions

Plan for 20-30% budget flexibility to handle unexpected opportunities or required adjustments.

# Maximizing ROI Through Strategic Partnerships

The most successful brands treat influencer marketing as relationship building rather than advertising placement. This mindset shift unlocks exponential returns over time.

## Building Long-Term Value

Short-term campaigns generate immediate results. Long-term partnerships compound those results while reducing acquisition costs.

Loyal influencer partners become brand advocates who promote your products organically beyond paid partnerships. They provide ongoing market feedback and help you stay ahead of trends.

Think of it as the difference between renting and buying. Rentals serve immediate needs. Ownership builds equity over time.

## Creating Win-Win Scenarios

The best influencer partnerships benefit everyone involved:

**Brands** gain authentic promotion and access to new audiences
**Influencers** receive fair compensation and quality products to share
**Audiences** discover valuable solutions and entertaining content

When all parties benefit, partnerships become sustainable and enjoyable rather than purely transactional.

## Scaling Success Stories

Once you identify successful influencer partnerships, systematically scale what works:

**Document successful campaign elements** for replication
**Expand partnerships** with proven performers
**Apply learnings** to new influencer recruitment
**Refine targeting** based on audience response data
**Optimize content formats** that drive best results

Scaling doesn't mean copying exactly. Adapt successful elements to different influencers while maintaining core principles that drive results.

# Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

Even experienced marketers make influencer marketing mistakes. Learning from common pitfalls saves time, money, and relationships.

## Authenticity Over Everything

The biggest mistake brands make is prioritizing reach over authenticity. Audiences can spot fake enthusiasm immediately. One authentic micro-influencer often outperforms multiple disengaged macro-influencers.

Choose partners who genuinely connect with your brand values and products. Authentic enthusiasm can't be faked, and audiences reward it with trust and action.

## Clear Communication Prevents Problems

Most influencer partnership problems stem from unclear expectations. Detailed briefs, explicit timelines, and regular check-ins prevent misunderstandings that damage relationships and campaign performance.

Over-communicate rather than under-communicate. It's easier to scale back communication than recover from misaligned expectations.

## FTC Compliance Isn't Optional

Influencer marketing regulations continue evolving, but transparency requirements remain constant. Ensure all partnerships include proper disclosure language and hashtags.

Non-compliance risks regulatory action and audience trust. Both consequences can devastate your brand reputation and marketing effectiveness.

## Quality Control Without Micromanagement

Balance brand consistency with creative freedom. Provide clear guidelines but trust influencers to execute within their authentic voice.

The goal is maintaining brand standards while preserving the authenticity that makes influencer marketing effective.

# Advanced Strategies for Competitive Advantage

Once you master the basics, advanced strategies can provide significant competitive advantages in crowded markets.

## Cross-Platform Integration

Don't limit influencer partnerships to single platforms. Integrate Instagram campaigns with YouTube, TikTok, podcast appearances, and blog features for maximum impact.

Cross-platform integration increases message frequency while reaching audiences with different content preferences. It also provides more value to influencer partners, strengthening relationships.

## Seasonal Campaign Planning

Plan influencer campaigns around seasonal trends, holidays, and industry events. Proactive planning secures better influencer availability and allows for more strategic content development.

Create annual calendar outlining key campaign periods, then begin influencer outreach 60-90 days in advance for optimal results.

## User-Generated Content Amplification

The best influencer campaigns spark user-generated content from regular customers. Design campaigns that encourage audience participation beyond simple likes and shares.

User-generated content provides social proof while extending campaign reach organically. It's like getting multiple influencers for the price of one.

## Micro-Moment Marketing

Identify specific moments when your target audience might need your product or service. Partner with influencers to create content that addresses these micro-moments with helpful solutions.

Micro-moment marketing increases relevance while demonstrating genuine value rather than obvious promotion.

# Future-Proofing Your Influencer Marketing

The influencer marketing landscape continues evolving rapidly. Successful brands adapt to changes while maintaining core relationship-building principles.

## Emerging Trends to Watch

**AI-powered influencer matching** will improve partnership quality while reducing research time
**Virtual and augmented reality** integration will create more immersive brand experiences
**Micro-video content** will continue growing across all platforms
**Authenticity verification** tools will help brands identify genuine engagement
**Performance-based compensation** models will become more sophisticated

Stay informed about emerging trends while focusing on timeless principles of authentic relationship building.

## Building Adaptable Systems

Create influencer marketing systems that can adapt to platform changes, algorithm updates, and shifting audience preferences.

Focus on building strong relationships and quality content rather than gaming specific platform features that might change overnight.

## Continuous Learning and Optimization

The most successful influencer marketers never stop learning. Regularly analyze campaign performance, test new approaches, and stay current with industry best practices.

Join influencer marketing communities, attend industry conferences, and maintain relationships with successful practitioners who can share insights and opportunities.

I have been financing myself since last 4-5 years. I take very little to no money from home (My family has an unstable financial situation). My income source is through tuitions. What I earn in a month goes by in a blink, food, rent, bills and especially on transportation. I avoid places where I know I have to spend (hangout, trips, etc). I feel drained and lifeless everyday. I’m very frustrated at this point. 
On top of that, due to some issues I couldn't work through the last two months (June, July). 

To be financially independent, I want to start a business asap, a tea/coffee/juice stall at an area within Dhaka. 

What I'm seeking right now is a loan of BDT 100k (one lakh taka), which I can repay in 6 months time with interest (I'm open to high interest rates). I can pay back in monthly installments. I'm willing to provide any necessary documents (passport, nid, tin certificate, current address, etc.). I am unable to provide any collateral because I don't have any assets in my name. I cannot opt for bank loan because I don't have a steady statement.

I know this is very random but my back is against the wall right now. I have bigger dreams, which I hope to fulfill when I have a stable situation and on my own. But I'm not getting the chance to get to that stable situation. This help will greatly impact my life. 

I will be deleting this post after 8 hours, it's actually very embarrassing for me to be asking like this but I currently have no one who can help me with this matter.

Please, hear me out?","I am at my limit here because of the latest accusation. So I'm in my early 20s and my dad is in his 40s. I swear, I am not malicious. I have easy explanations for everything. I know I'm dumb, but I'm not terrible. 


I've recently moved back in while I search for a job and that was a freaking mistake. The accusations are basically:

1. I am hiding dirty used pads in my clothes at night because I don't want to throw them out

2. I secretly took a photo of him (??)

3. I am awake all night, specifically just to listen to him from his room. And when he comes, I yank my charger out the wall

4. Wanting to go grocery shopping with him to control what he buys

Typing it out, these aren't as weird as when he accused me of doing something devious when I just needed to go to the bathroom, and then I had to literally hold it in, because I didn't know if he was awake or not. 

ANYWAY. For one, he made that accusation because I had thrown away my pad and my panties at the same time after a shower. That was it. I've almost always gone outside to throw away my pads, and I've even gotten sick doing so. The two times I didn't, I had put the pads in a bag, tied it up, and put it in the closet.

If I were sleeping with dirty pads on me, I would smell disgusting. My blankets will smell disgusting. So would my sheets and stuff. And I'd have gotten caught because things always slide off the mattress.

For 2, what happened simply was that my phone was like vaguely in his direction when something fell. That's all that is. I don't know if I need to explain that I have reason to randomly sneak a picture of my dad.

For 3, I am sort of a light sleeper and I wake up randomly at night. It sucks. My dad wakes me up because he's literally just stomping everywhere (I sleep in the living room), rattling the garage and front door to see if it's unlocked, checking the windows, and then making coffee.

That's always enough for me to wake up, so I just lie there awkwardly, and try to go back to sleep. Sometimes even move because a position is uncomfortable. 

We have this rule to charge our phones before we go to sleep. So, that's what I do. And I got accused of the whole weird sleeping thing because stuff keeps sliding off my bed and he wakes me up. My hearing is bad, actually. I ask people to repeat themselves. And I would pass out if I tried staying up that long. I'm not exaggerating, I always pass out after an all nighter.

For 4, I am getting my food stamps soon. I want to go with my dad to go grocery shopping so I can get a case of water. I don't think I could honestly carry it in my backpack or in my hands for a mile. And then I got accused of that. Why even? Is he going to overspend my EBT?? It's not like I could even say anything. He'd just bring up the thing about how I owe him for using his address on an application for general assistance.

I was made aware that the county could help me with housing for like a year. They even help with furniture. I just need to find a job. I'm getting help with my resume, so hopefully I finally manage to get a job.

Sweat beads lined the edge of my forehead as I struggled to keep my eyes fixated on the newspaper that shielded my eyes from the woman sitting across from me.
 
“It’s like you don’t love me anymore, darling. Did I do something wrong?’

Her leg shot up underneath the table, and her foot grazed my shin and right knee. I heard the water droplets drip down onto the floor as she rubbed her foot up and down against my leg. 

“Pleaaseee, darling. Won’t you look at me?’ she begged 

I sipped my coffee shakily and adjusted the newspaper in my hand. My heart thumped to the beat of a machine gun while my wife’s chipped and dirty nails clicked and clacked atop our dining room table. You see, it’s not that I didn’t want to see her; I loved my wife with all of my heart and soul. She was my rock, my support beam, and I’d give anything to have her back. Well, the *real* her. Because the person sitting before me today was *not* my wife. 

My wife was an angel. An illuminating light in my world of darkness. What happened to her was tragic and completely unjust, but it was also my fault. I was the reason behind her accident, the reason why she put on her stunning wedding gown one last time before throwing herself off the highest bridge in our city, and plummeting to her death in the watery grave below. 

We argued, and I said some things I didn’t mean; dear God, I want to take them back, but I can’t. I’m stuck, I’m imprisoned here with this, this, imposter. This sacrilegious thing that has taken the place of my wife. I was drunk and I told her I didn’t think she was attractive, and I’m sorry, okay?! I’m sorry for what I’ve done. She knows I thought she was beautiful, I know she knows it, she *has* to know, right? 

“Donavinnnnn..you’re still not looking at meee,” 

I was at my breaking point, and tears began to sting my eyes. Her cold, grey hand reached over and caressed the edge of my newspaper, leaving dark, wet streaks running down the length of it. She ran her hand across the top back and forth, and eventually the paper grew soggy and damp in my hands. The corners began to fold in, and my wife’s decaying face started forcing its way into view. 

With one flick of her broken wrist, she pushed the paper, and the whole thing slumped over in my arms. 

Maggots ate away at her face, and gaping black wounds etched the sides of her neck. Her eye sockets were completely black and hollow, but the worst part of all was her mouth. Her jaw was dislocated, yet her words came out so fluently, filling the room with the stench of rotting meat each time she spoke.

“Aren’t I pretty, Donavin? Don’t you love me?”

Her pouts grew into sobs, which eventually mutated into distorted wails. Ear-splitting screams that only I could hear. 

She’s still wearing her beautiful wedding dress, the silky white now coated with mucus and mud.

I love my wife. I miss my wife. Lord, forgive me for what I’ve done to my wife.

The AQUA CREST AQK-CF23B NSF/ANSI-certified multiple-stage replacement water filter recently caught my attention. For someone who values clean drinking water almost as much as their morning coffee, this filter seemed promising. My kitchen faucet put it to the test, and I’ve got plenty to share—good, bad, and everything in between.

**Design That Fits, Literally and Figuratively**

Straight out of the box, this filter's design impressed me. Compact, lightweight, and straightforward to handle, its understated look doesn’t scream for attention, which suits its utility-focused purpose. Its dimensions (8.07""D x 7.09""W x 8.07""H) make it less hassle to install, even with a cramped under-sink setup. The build quality feels solid, and while it’s predominantly carbon fiber, AQUA CREST doesn’t cut corners on durability. What I appreciated most, however, was its compatibility with widespread pitcher and dispenser filters, particularly the ZeroWater range. It doesn’t just work—it complements.

**[Check AQUA CREST AQK-CF23B price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b01ew807j4/)**  

**Filtration That Actually Delivers**

Living in an area with fairly hard water, I was keen to see just how well this filter performed. It didn’t disappoint. Independently tested against NSF/ANSI 42, 53, and 372 standards, it cuts through contaminants like chlorine, lead, and PFOA/PFOS with impressive efficiency—98% reduction rate, they say. After installation, the metallic tang in my water disappeared, giving way to a far fresher taste. If you’re a fan of low-mineral content water, you’ll be as thrilled as I was with its TDS (total dissolved solids) reduction capability.

**Ease of Installation Makes It A Standout**

Installing this filter wasn’t just easy—it was almost foolproof. As someone whose DIY adventures typically end up resembling crime scenes, I appreciated the clear instructions and leak-free fit. It’s also a welcome change to have a product support the original brand standards without actually being a branded replacement. This compatibility without compromise would make even a novice feel confident.

**Winning Points**

- Certified for outstanding filtration of chlorine, lead, and mercury.  
- Works seamlessly with ZeroWater pitchers and other dispenser models.  
- Impressive capacity—each filter is equivalent to 250 bottles of water.  
- Leak-free design avoids messy troubles during usage.  

**Disadvantages**

Of course, perfection is rare, and this filter has its quirks. While I celebrate its utility, there were some areas where I wasn’t entirely sold.

- Doesn’t fully eliminate the need for frequent replacements if you have heavy water usage.  
- TDS reduction may vary depending on your water source, making results inconsistent.  
- While compact, squeezing it into some pitcher filters required just a tad more finesse than expected.

**Product Rivals**

This product invites direct comparison with other heavyweights like Brita and ZeroWater. The AQUA CREST filter excels with its certified lead and PFOA removal—a step up from the Brita filters, which focus more on chlorine. However, the ZeroWater system's unique five-layer filtration might appeal to those hyper-focused on purity. Yet, the AQK-CF23B delivers similar results at a friendlier price point without compromising performance. You may sacrifice some aesthetic appeal and brand clout, but the functional equivalence is clear.

**True Value**

When weighing the benefits, functionality, and certifications against the competitive landscape, this replacement filter comes out as a solid value proposition. It’s reliable, delivers on its promises, and doesn’t break the bank over time, especially when you consider it replaces up to 250 bottles per unit. For those of us navigating tight budgets without sacrificing water safety, this option provides peace of mind without costing an arm and a leg.

Took the doors off a TV media cabinet unit and figure it can hold about 300 records. Past that I’ll have to add storage. 

Speakers on the same surface as turntable but with foam absorbing pads under them it really doesn’t seem to cause an issue. One day speaker stands might be in the mix. Had slight concerns about all the weight on the floor distributed via 4 steel table feet but after doing some math it seems the floor should be fine. Felt pads under feet to hopefully avoid denting.

The turntable does a good job for me. My kids (6 and 4) love using it, too. It’ll be theirs once they really learn the ways and I’ll probably upgrade this for me. Meantime it’s a great family setup.

This past spring, I visited Sweden briefly on a business trip, and I was completely captivated by the country’s charm.

Even though I’m Korean, I find myself thinking every day that I’d love to return to Sweden if I get the chance. I even daydream about one day living there with permanent residency, though I know I can’t become Swedish myself.

Based on my short experience, here are the strengths and weaknesses I’ve observed about Sweden. I’d appreciate some realistic advice so that I don’t get lost in illusions the next time I visit.


---

Strengths of Sweden

Aesthetic of calmness, simplicity, and restraint — a sense of minimalism that permeates public spaces

No overwhelming or cluttered signboards; everything feels organized and unified

Even in the capital, Stockholm, there is little unnecessary noise, odor, or trash. The air feels clean.

Shops, even duty-free stores at the airport, felt calm rather than flashy or loud. It seemed like the whole country is infused with a design philosophy of balance, simplicity, and restraint (Lagom?) that creates a healing, orderly atmosphere.

Everyday products and household goods also seem to share this same aesthetic.

Introverted personalities are naturally accepted. Unlike in Korea, where louder people tend to dominate, Swedes share opinions in a calm and relaxed way.

As someone introverted myself, I felt I could live more comfortably and naturally in such an environment. In Korea, being too quiet or passive can often be a disadvantage.

At work, when issues arise, people are open and honest, and others are understanding.

A general culture that encourages rest. In Korea, rest is often associated with laziness or falling behind in competition, but in Sweden it seems genuinely respected.

English is widely spoken, so it’s possible to live without much trouble even without knowing Swedish. Education levels seemed high.

Store employees and service staff generally felt kind and polite.

Fika time: I loved the idea of connecting with colleagues over coffee breaks rather than having to bond through late-night dinners or drinking, as is common in Korea. Being a coffee lover, this felt like paradise.

Many people, both men and women, are very attractive. Walking through busy streets felt like watching models.

In Eskilstuna, I was impressed by how well nature was preserved and maintained. On clear days, the scenery was breathtaking.

A flat organizational culture: individuality and diversity are respected as long as they don’t cause harm. Performance is valued, but so is uniqueness.

Long-term strategic mindset: even if something doesn’t bring immediate profit, they invest in technology and research with a future-oriented perspective (though perhaps this depends on the company, and may not always extend to overseas branches).

Less obsession with pure meritocracy; people are evaluated with a long-term view, and different working styles are respected.

Gender equality: unlike in Korea where gender conflict is visible, Swedish women seem proactive and equality feels normalized. It was strikingly different from Korea’s culture of “special treatment” for women.

Family-centered values: family time is respected and prioritized, often over work. After-hours, people naturally spend time with family first. Even in workplaces, family responsibilities are openly acknowledged, and schedules are flexibly adjusted as long as it doesn’t harm others.



---

Weaknesses of Sweden

Sometimes the food was far too salty. Company cafeteria meals were fine, but hamburgers and pub dishes were overwhelmingly salty — even for me, though I usually enjoy salty food in Korea. It felt like “saltiness” was considered a delicacy.

Extremely high cost of living. Since I used a corporate card, it wasn’t a big issue during my trip, but as a tourist it would mean significant expenses.

At times, seeing groups of strong-looking Middle Eastern men walking together made me feel uneasy. I never experienced any harm, but I did feel a sense of tension and avoided dark alleys.

Outside of work, it was difficult to have natural conversations with Swedes. People rarely make eye contact, and social boundaries feel very clear. While this is comfortable in some ways, I can imagine it becoming lonely if I were to stay long-term.



---

I quickly wrote down these thoughts. Please feel free to criticize them freely.

Even if I like Sweden, I want to correct any mistaken impressions.

I don’t feel comfortable asking my Swedish colleagues these kinds of questions, so I wanted to ask you here.

1n40gk3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n40gk3,Second test blood work - call with Dr on Wednesday,"Hello everyone,

I’m hoping I can get a little advice here.

I’m a 34 year old father of two who has been feeling “not normal” for some time. I consistently have low energy, poor sleep, I can’t lift weights like I used to when I was younger, low sex drive and I can’t seem to drop weight no matter what I do. I’m 6’ 1” and 240lbs and have struggled with migraines, vertigo/dizziness and some depression style symptoms.

I called my Dr last year in January and got tested as I felt I ticked a lot of symptoms of low testosterone. We ran blood work that came back in the lower section of “normal” and I was told that there was nothing we could do, TRT wouldn’t help and I needed to change my diet and exercise etc etc. “lift heavy” I was told, despite me saying I don’t have energy to do so. 

Test results from 2024:

Testosterone - 9.4 (8.4-28.8)
Free test - 266 (196-636)
Thyroid hormone - 1.69 (0.32-4.0)

Fast forward to this last month, I’ve still felt the same, if not worse. I called and scheduled an additional blood test. Leading up to this blood test for the last month I have completely cut out energy drinks, brought myself down to 1 coffee per day. Tried everything I could with pillows and sleep, my wife and I have been more active too. I also cut out most alcohols except for the odd whisky and have been doing a basement demo remodel moving a couple thousand pounds of materials.

My results came back lower than last year. 

Results from 2025:

Testosterone - 8.6 (8.4-28.8)
Free test - 238 (196-636)
Thyroid hormone - 1.51 (0.32-4.0)

I have a call set up with my doctor on Wednesday to discuss. I’m afraid he’ll tell me im “in the normal range” despite being at the absolute bottom of it. It doesn’t make sense to me that you would have to wait for someone to be below the ranges when you’re within 2% of being deemed “low”.

I’m looking for input from others who are in a similar situation - I’d hate to have to wait 6 months for things to drop under the “normal” range to just redo everything again.

It’s also hard to go through this when a friend of mine had blood work done and had higher results but was prescribed TRT to resolve similar issues.

I’m in Canada and am working with my family doctor.

Please let me know if any additional information would help and I greatly appreciate any input from you all!",1,1756557118.0,Testosterone,2,1.0,False

We hit it off great, exchanged numbers, and started texting everyday. We shared lots of personal stuff with each other and after about 1.5 to 2 weeks of talking we decided to go on a lunch date. Well he had been joking about me coming to his work to bug him so I decided two days before the date that I was gonna bring him some coffee to work as a surprise. This was also because I was nervous and wanted to see him before our date to ease nerves during our date. So I took him a coffee and we talked for like an hour and a half. He even texted me after and told me that he really wanted to kiss me. So we continued to talk to each other for the next two days and when Friday came around he had to cancel the date because of a migraine. I believed him because he said previously that he gets military disability for migraines and PTSD. So we rescheduled for the next Wednesday. That weekend he had his daughter and I was having my daughter’s birthday party, but we still talked a ton. This included a conversation Saturday night that started after he texted me that he was thinking about me and just wanted me to know that. Then we talked for an hour and decided that we really wanted to see each other again before Wednesday, so we agreed to meet at the mall on Sunday after he dropped his daughter off. We met there and walked around for a while talking. He held my hand, then put his arms around me and kissed the top of my head. At one point I kissed him on the cheek and he smiled. We eventually made our way outside to a bench because the mall was closing soon and as we sat talking, he kissed me. Then we spent the next 20 minutes just kissing. After that we went to his car and hung out for a bit because the mall was closed. We spent another maybe hour just talking and kissing. No sex happened just A LOT of really good kissing. He even referred to me as his soon to be girlfriend. When we eventually parted ways I texted him to tell him I was falling for him and he said he was falling for me too. Then we texted a bunch. He had to work the next two days so he couldn’t text as much, but when he did text he told me that his day was going rough. He works as a security officer at a hospital, he’s also an army veteran. The second day he worked, which would have been Tuesday, he texted me at one point near the end of his shift and said he had to physically fight a woman and she scratched him. He didn’t talk much after that. I texted him that night to let him know I was excited about our date the next day. When Wednesday came he texted me this “Good morning.  I am sorry i haven’t been talking as much.  Last two days were rough and today is a particularly bad day too.   I am trying to muster through it, and I do want to see you today.  Just trying to get through this mental stuff right now.  Again I am sorry about this.” I have not heard from him since. I did send a few follow up texts just to check on him, but I don’t want to be too punchy if he’s dealing with some stuff. I do know how bad mental health issues can get. I guess my question is: do you guys think he is just taking time to recover from his mental health state, or was this the world’s most f’ed up way to ghost someone?",1,1756556553.0,AskMenRelationships,0,1.0,False

Thought it was just another miss. But then I tried it on Aeropress — and boom. Totally different experience, especially at the 55 degrees and cooler temperatures of drinking. Loved it so much I stocked up on 3 more bags.

Later tried the Kuttinkhan Estate — and again, it clicked right away. Ended up getting 2 extra bags of that too. What I’ve noticed is that both these lots have been super consistent in roast and taste. I’m wondering if it’s because they’re from a fresh harvest, or if these estates are just that reliable.

On the contrary, I still haven’t figured out how to love the Skià coffee and not able to finish it.

I'm not sure I understand the electrical in it though. Seems like none of the plugs or fridge will work without the inverter being on. Is that normal or is there a bypass switch like the older popups? I know I'm getting shore power because the battery is reading 100 percent and the fridge ran all night. What's weird to me is it cant seem to handle a coffee pot without tripping a GFI but my 30 year old colman could do it no problem. Am I missing something stupid?

1n40196,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1n40196/ward_boundary_change_im_fuming/,Ward boundary change - I'm fuming,"Okay, I'm PIMO, of a sort. Everyone knows I dont believe and no longer consider myself Mormon, my family and ward members included. I still attend on Sundays because that's where my wife is and what's important to her and we have a small but incredible ward who are genuinely welcoming and helpful to our young family (these people do exist, I swear). For me, the community of our ward continues to be enough of a reason to go (though second hour i sit in a cafe sipping coffee usually).

HOWEVER 

It's stake conference weekend and at the leadership meeting (I heard through the grapevine very quickly) that they're disestablishing our ward and merging it with the slightly larger but struggling main ward in the stake centre. This came as such a surprise that apparently our bishop was finding out at the same time as everyone else. 

Why am I mad you ask? Isn't the shrinkage fantastic?? Yes, but...

1. We now have a 25 minute drive to the other side of town instead of a five minute drive 
2. We have 3 kids aged 6 and under and church starts at 9. They have before and I'm sure will yet again refuse to change the start time. Instead of being somewhat stressed every week and arriving late, we'll now have the privilege of getting up even earlier on Sunday and wrangling kids like it's a school day.
3. The changes are immediate. No chance to meet again as our little ward community, no chance to say goodbye or thanks to leaders who have helped us, including financially, for the past 3+ years. We didn’t even know that last week was the last time we'd meet together as a ward. 

That's all frustrating enough, but the kickers is 

4. No consultation, no feedback process. It's 'trust us, we know what we're doing' which is code for, shut the fuck up and don't ask questions, this is what Jesus would want. The hubris of these men to make major decisions that affect our lives and not consult, not give notice, not provide support, but to expect us to turn up on Sunday, raise our hands to sustain leadership and never ask questions is so on brand. I've already spoken to close friends and family, but they're all Mormon and all apologists who say 'Yes it will be hard, but I trust the men who say they've worked hard and agonised that they are doing what's best'. I don't. I think they're incompent or inconsiderate or some measure of both. 

For fucks sake, when I heard about it i posted on the stake facebook page about who we could talk to about concerns, and the post was promptly deleted. I was then messaged privately and told I would be put in touch with stake leaders. They will pat me on the head, tell me to pray about it, and go on my way. I wont pray cause no one's listening, but it wouldnt matter because if I got a different answer, it would be the wrong one. You see, you have to pray until you come to the same conclusion as the leadership has - that's how the get unfettered obedience and license to make changes unchallenged. And then no one can say anything, because if youre opposed you're possessed by Satan. 

The ONE good thing about this church is the community my family and I actually love and thrive in, and they're ripping that away without second thoughts. Oh and guess what? They're building a temple here. And guess what else? After they combine our ward with the other one at the stake centre? The weekly attendance is expected to sit at around 150. Who the fuck will be manning this temple?? I get why logistically they're merging, but their approach is so myopic it's infuriating. 

My wife is crushed btw. I don't know that it'll bring her further out, but even she was grumbling that this decision was made by men who don't have the burden of childcare to consider when making these changes. She doesnt know how right she is. No woman would have been consulted. The backbone of the church, but the lack of dicks means no godly superpowers apparently. Apparently at the meeting during the announcement one leader joked about being sensitive to widows who will complain about having to drive an extra 20 minutes. Hilarious, if it weren't true, but who cares about mothers and widows, they just need to exercise more faith. 

Sorry. This post must be confusing for some people and I've basically just ranted, but if I can clarify by writing the post or replying to comments I will. ",45,1756555822.0,exmormon,21,0.99,False

When it's just you and me and our cat and dog, I promise… you'll be doted over like you've never been before. I'll be making your coffee *exactly* how you like it, opening your car door, making you things, giving you random kisses, pats on the butt, pulling you into my arms, hand on your knee while we watch TV, and, yeah… whispering sweet nothings into your ear at every opportunity…

But, for now… I have to resort to words.  
The problem with words, though, is…  
I don't ever know what's gonna come out.

Sometimes I sit down aiming to write you the tenderest, sweetest little ""I see you there, you lovely little thing"" note… but what comes out is an ode to your butt. Sometimes, the reverse happens… I *think* I'm gonna write you something that's gonna leave you reaching into your nightstand drawer for whatever might happen to be safely tucked away there… but what comes out is my heart spilling its whole entire self to you, just reveling in the astonishing warmth of the love I have for you.

But sometimes…  
Nothing.

That's when you get those ""Hey, baby, pretty zonked tonight…"" letters. You know the ones… maybe feeling a bit dull, a bit forced…

But, baby. Baby. That's not a reflection of how I feel about you, never not ever. *That* never stops, *that* is a never ending fountain of pure unfiltered love. Unfortunately, just… the creative centers aren't always at their best. Those would be the nights that I would just hold you and play with your hair. The nights I'd give you soft kisses and nuzzle into your neck. Those are the nights I'd love you softly, tenderly, catering to any need you might have… My voice maybe may not say much, but my hands *would*.

I know this isn't what you meant, but I'd already been thinkin' about it anyways.

I've also been thinking about the past few months… the vulnerability… baby, when you started blossoming for me like that… opening up your petals as to the morning sun… showing me so much more of you than most, maybe even more of you all at once than anyone…

Baby, *anyone* would be afraid after that. The most securely attached person in the world would still have the vulnerability hangover to end all vulnerability hangovers after that, love. And I should have seen it earlier… should have been more prepared.

I know we can't avoid *every* storm, but baby I'm working on my weather radar. And my navigation skills. Learning how to better fly on instruments.

Maybe you didn't listen much to that one song I sent you not long ago… wouldn't blame you, it's, um… there is a softer version out there, but… baby… all I wanted you to hear was

*I can't promise that things won't be broken, but I swear that I will never leave.*

Maybe you're not used to this, sweet love, and you know? Neither am I… But that doesn't make it any less real, any less true, or any less genuine.

There's something about us, babe.  
And the universe *cannot* get away with keeping it from being.

I won't let it.

I love you, baby. With my whole entire being. And no matter what happens… I will *always* hold your heart as carefully as I know how to do.

Yours, baby. Now, tomorrow, forever. Yours.",8,1756555820.0,UnsentLetters,2,1.0,False
