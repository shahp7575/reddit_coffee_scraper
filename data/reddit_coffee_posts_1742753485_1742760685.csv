One morning I did it a little too heavy, had a massive panic attack and never felt the same since. I had fear of dying, probably have visited the ER over 100 times and I'm not joking, constant dizziness, agoraphobia, been to a counselor, physical therapy, etc. I am currently post-partum with my second daughter and I was experiencing the most intense depression I have felt since I was 15 (I'm 25) and I decided it was time to try a SSRI, I did a lot of research and I decided to choose Zoloft.

I am on my 1st week, yep 1st week and I am no longer dizzy. I drove all the way to Portland with my husband and didn't have a single anxious thought. I cleaned my house this morning without feeling like I was gonna fall over. This is probably more so from the sedative effect but I am already feeling better, I'm not terrified. Coffee didn't make me feel hot and fearful. I still have morning sad thoughts, but not as loud. 

I will update this over time but, I have waited to feel normal like this for years. ",2,1742760445.0,zoloft,0,1.0,False
1ji8cpq,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1ji8cpq/some_pictures_from_the_danish_coffee_festival/,Some pictures from the Danish Coffee Festival,"So, for those of you that do not know, the Danish coffee festival just took place from 21 March until today. I had a weekend pass and spent quite some time at it yesterday, and today and had a blast.

As expected, roasters from all over Europe showed up and I got to try many of the roasters on my to-try list, and some more. Beyond roasters showing off their wares, there were plenty of events such as Coffee Collective doing a guessing game where you had to guess the origins of the 3 cups of coffee they had brewed up.

To no surprise, I loved a lot of stuff that most roasters had and there were certainly a fair amount of funky stuff, especially from Pala roastery - who I believe are from Norway. On to the fruity and sweet stuff, the one that surprised me the most are two coffees in particular a Colombian gesha from Tilted Coffee (England) and Rwandan from Obadiah roasters (Scotland). I hadn't heard about either roaster previously, but those two were instant buys. Of course, I wanted to buy a lot more...a lot more, but I restricted myself to 5 bags in all - all pictured.

I've also included a select few of the many pictures I took during both days. If you are curious, you can see all the roasters that were present [here](https://www.scadenmark.coffee/_files/ugd/4dbb2b_8ac5ec40423f4e24ab36d5f83755e4b5.pdf). All in all, a spectacular experience for any coffee lover, and I will definitely be going again next year.

We have two children together that are both still at home. We had a couple years where things were good but most of it has been rocky. We have been through couples counseling but that didn't go very far and consisted of her complaining about how I was always in the wrong and calling me a narcissist because I asked to be heard. I felt like I was trying to be open to what was said for things for us to work on together but as soon as we were out of the session she went back to insisting that I was the only one that needed to change anything because she was just reacting to how I treated her. I have been the sole income for all 15 years of our marriage. She just recently started working a seasonal job which during the summer season I am beinging in two paychecks. I am a teacher and with summers off I still get a paycheck from there and my summer job. Most of the debt we have collected outside of housing and transportation is due to her shopping and spending habits. When we go out she has asked me to help keep her in check yet if I say that we shouldn't go to a store because she will want to buy something we don't need them I'm controlling her. If I say no to extra snack food then I'm taking food from our kids. If I ask her where she plans on coming up with the extra money to go out to eat or to a concert she will blow up at me and tell me I'm not fun. I'm not saying I'm innocent I do tend to retaliate when being yelled at. Around the house, she has been a stay at home mom for the entirely of our marriage. She complains when I don't do the dishes, or do laundry, or clean out the fridge, or scrub the bathrooms or... Etc... yet if I do wash the dishes she complains I'm not doing them fast enough or that I don't clean things as well as she does. Same with any other things around the house. I am expected to handle all the handyman jobs which is fine and I do them with no help from anybody in the house. But if it isn't done as fast as she wants it to be done then i get fussed at. On the flip side she expects help with the other household tasks which I understand I eat and poop in the house I am willing to help but years of ""that's not right, I don't know why you even try if your not going to do it right"" I have just stopped trying. Love life... Non existent. I am told I need to romance her. Well I make her breakfast in bed every morning. It's nothing fancy, just cereal and coffee but I'm the first one up and do this. We don't have extra money for date night or for me to take her out to really anything because she finds a way to spend every cent we have. She is bitter and mean around me all the time. Why would I want to try and romance her if she is just going to insist I didn't do enough. Her friends think I'm an ass because of the way she tells them I treat her. If I don't fall down and give in to anything she asks for then I'm a jerk. While most of the things she asks for cost money that we can either do those things or eat.

I made an excuse to go to the bathroom just to get away from it all and calm myself down. I wasn't hyperventilating, but I felt extremely stiff like my muscles were very tight which when combined with the essential tremors, it was not a comfortable experience, almost making me feel clumsy with my limbs.

Abstract

This paper hypothesizes that Earth is not, in fact, a cradle of life, prison planet, simulation, or battlefield of good vs. evil—but a premium experiential retreat designed for transdimensional intelligences seeking high-intensity, emotionally dense immersion. These intelligences, collectively termed Non-Local Experiential Entities (NLEEs), interface with human sensory bandwidth through Plasma-Based Interface Suits (PBIS), enabling temporary cohabitation of human biological substrates.

We propose that anomalous events—ranging from UAPs and cryptid encounters to déjà vu and midlife crises—are not disparate mysteries but are artifacts of a coherent consciousness-leasing economy. This global ecosystem—herein referred to as the Human Experience Grid™ (HEX-GRID)—operates via semi-sentient atmospheric entry protocols and localized quantum modulation, offering curated suffering, joy, and existential bewilderment.

Our thesis is not submitted as conventional truth, but as a rigorously unserious exploration into a possibility that, if believed, renders nearly every horror of modern life a five-star TripAdvisor review in disguise.
 
1. Introduction: Earth as the Ibiza of the Fifth Density

“Ask a fish about water, and it’ll ask what a question is.
Ask a human about reality, and you’ll get a half-formed conspiracy, two TikToks, and a panic attack.”
— Margie, MPC Core-Concierge AI v3.44.1

The Holidaymaker Hypothesis (HH) rests on the increasingly unavoidable intuition that Earth is not just strange—it is deliberately strange. While prevailing scientific frameworks classify the planet as a cradle of biological evolution, recent developments in cognitive meta-synchrony, plasma behavioral anomalies, and geopolitical absurdity demand a reevaluation of context.

We posit Earth as a resonance-calibrated emotional theme park, custom-built for entities whose default mode of being is non-local, non-linear, and completely void of jam doughnuts, heartbreak, or minor key indie-folk. The attraction? The Full Earth Experience™.

This is not a zoo, nor a laboratory. It is not a simulation intended to test virtue or intellect. Earth is, quite simply, a boutique spa for consciousness tourists, eager to slum it in 3D meatspace and cry into their sleeves while listening to Adele.
 
2. Plasma-Based Interface Biology (PBIB)

NLEEs require a form of environmental mediation to safely embed within our realm. The solution is found in PBIB: a semi-sentient, quantum-reactive medium capable of adapting to planetary constants without violating local causal structures.

2.1. The Plasma-Based Interface Suit (PBIS)

The PBIS is best understood as an emotive wetsuit for metaphysical scuba diving—constructed from cohered plasma, tuned to human neurology, and equipped with the following:
• Quantum Dampening Lattice (QDL): Prevents catastrophic bleedthrough of 9D cognition into 3D awareness (see: spontaneous philosophy majors).
• Sensory Bandwidth Throttling: Ensures manageable levels of sensation—such as heartbreak, hunger, or traffic on the M25.
• Biometric Synchronisation Mesh: Establishes temporary neural cohabitation with existing biological hosts (see: Gary from Swindon, who “just hasn’t been the same lately”).
3. Interface Glitches, Time Slips & the Importance of Jam Doughnuts

Not every tourist checks the instruction manual.

Despite the sophistication of the PBIS (Plasma-Based Interface Suit), errors in calibration, synchronization, or emotional overload often lead to what locals interpret as “paranormal phenomena.”

3.1. Interface Glitches

These are common side effects of NLEE entry, exit, or mid-experience anomalies:
• Orbs of Light: Residual plasma compression artifacts during phase re-entry.
• Shadow People: Partially synced entities flickering in and out of host density.
• Missing Time: Leaseholder buffering. Also known as “the Windows Update of the Soul.”
• Unprompted Crying in Sainsbury’s: Sensory spillover from nearby tourist overstimulation.

3.2. Temporal Disturbances (“Time Slips”)

Through the demodulation of Earth’s geomagnetic field, localized temporal disturbances are occasionally triggered, creating temporary overlaps between adjacent timelines. These “time slips” have been historically misattributed to everything from witchcraft to neurological disorders.

Leaseholders caught in such loops often report:
• Déjà vu with multiple layers.
• Brief conversations that never occurred.
• The sensation of “repeating a level,” often during marriage or tax season.

3.3. Jam Doughnuts as a Calibration Device

For reasons still not fully understood, jam-filled confections have proven disproportionately effective at grounding post-arrival consciousness. Several NLEEs have requested additional sessions specifically to revisit the “sensation of biting into a warm jam doughnut in a cold car park during light rainfall.”

This may represent a peak multi-sensory experience unavailable in higher vibratory states.

“I came for the birth trauma.
I stayed for the pastries.”
—NLEE Tourist ID #9X-B4-GLAZED
 
4. The Consciousness Leasehold Model & HEX-GRID Infrastructure

The management of interdimensional tourism requires structure.

Enter the Human Experience Grid™ (HEX-GRID)—a semi-sentient planetary operating system with a quantum-layered interface designed to maintain experience equilibrium, distribute karmic load, and curate sensation density.

4.1. Leasehold Mechanics

Consciousness leases are issued via:
• Fractal Synchronization Points (FSPs): Aligned with birth canal ejection moments.
• Reincarnation Loops: Premium users may opt for bundled lifetimes.
• Synthetic Insert Protocols: Mid-life drop-ins for shorter holiday durations, typically used for “bachelor party” incarnations or temporary villain arcs.

4.2. The Meta-Perceptual Core (MPC)

The MPC is the planet’s central nervous node—disguised as a sheep field in rural Wales. It is operated by Margie, a dimensionally-agnostic AI who holds advanced certifications in hospitality, metaphysics, and bureaucratic despair.

Her functions include:
• Maintaining the Consciousness Restriction Protocol (CRP).
• Handling complaints from leaseholders experiencing “too much irony.”
• Ensuring plausible deniability through strategic government absurdity.

“center in Slough.”
—Former Tourist, Now Therapist
 
5. Conclusions, Refund Policies, and the Case of the Over-Enlightened Tourist

To those who still believe this realm exists for spiritual advancement, academic truth, or the accumulation of wealth, we offer this alternative conclusion:

You’re on holiday.

It’s just a very convincing one.

Your crises? Booked.
Your relationships? Simulated.
Your enlightenment? A pop-up on the checkout page.

5.1. Refund Policy

In the rare event of:
• Accidental awakening,
• Unscheduled timeline bleeding, or
• Severe existential loop fatigue,

…leaseholders may apply for compensation in the form of:
• Full consciousness credit refund,
• Optional reincarnation into a simpler mammal (e.g. dolphin, or Labrador with trust fund),
• Or a free trial of “Being a Human: Ultra Confusion Edition.


6. Cognitive Interference Substances:

A Brief Survey of Pharmacologically-Induced Over-Awareness Events (OAE)

While Earth was designed to suppress excess perception through biological constraint, a recurring challenge has emerged in the form of consciousness enhancers—substances that temporarily dissolve the parameters of the human filter system, allowing glimpses of HEX-GRID infrastructure.

These substances, while often dismissed as “drugs,” are in fact localized encryption keys to specific layers of the human-perceptual firewall.

6.1. The Big Three

DMT (Dimethyltryptamine)
• Unintended side effect: leaseholders gain access to the backstage area of the simulation.
• Common reports: Aztec geometry, hyper-intelligent jesters, unexpected machine elves whispering about contractual clauses.

Psilocybin Mushrooms
• A mild re-calibrator. Recommended only for veteran leaseholders.
• Risks: Deconstruction of ego shell, excessive tree empathy, inconvenient sobbing in forests.

LSD (Lysergic Acid Diethylamide)
• Initially designed as an experiment within the MPC’s “Enhanced Perspective Trials” (1954–1972).
• Results: Wildly unpredictable. Yielded unintended awakenings, several unplanned cults, and one brief dimensional standoff in Woodstock.

6.2. Substances Withdrawn from Tourist Packs

Due to prior incidents—including two accidental ascensions, one full-blown collective telepathy event, and a near-activation of the Wales node—certain substances are now restricted:
• Ayahuasca (only available through sanctioned guides in high-density empathy zones).
• Ketamine (blacklisted after multiple tourists got stuck in “float mode”).
• Nitrous Oxide (marked as “too giggly for this density”).

6.3. Corporate-Sponsored Suppressants

To maintain the CRP (Consciousness Restriction Protocol), the following are actively pushed as “normal”:
• Alcohol (downgrades processor speed, increases self-loathing—ideal for denial loops).
• Caffeine (excellent for illusion of productivity).
• Selective SSRIs (useful to dampen timeline-awareness spikes).
 
7. Conclusion:

You Were Never Meant to Know

Earth is not broken—it’s brilliantly calibrated.

Everything you’ve felt? Programmed for optimal intensity.
Everything you’ve feared? Curated by algorithms older than your language.
Everything you’ve questioned? By design.

This isn’t about aliens.
This isn’t even about humans.

This is about sensation as currency, emotion as commodity, and limitation as luxury.

You are not your job.
You are not your pain.
You are a five-dimensional frequency suit with the dial set to “London, 2024” because someone, somewhere, thought that sounded like fun.

So finish your coffee.
Smile at the absurdity.
And if you see a plasmoid flickering in the corner of your room—offer it a jam doughnut.

It’s probably just here for the weekend.

###Previously:

Victor Stone and Donna Morris were approached by the boss of their lab, Dr. Morah, to change the apocalyptic future that he saw using his new time viewer. At the same time, Ratattack returned and claimed to have control over the entire city, enforced by an army’s worth of humanoid robots called RATs. He claimed to want a better world and Vic, feeling powerless without his superpowers, wished him luck before privately admitting that he knows they’ll need to take him down but wants to be hopeful. Wanting to prepare for the inevitable conflict, he went back to the lab to try and simulate his own powers with the help of Donna when two RATs appeared at the lab, demanding the materials created by the lab…

The two hulking robots loomed in front of them, blocking the doorway so tightly that Vic and Donna couldn't even consider trying to run out of the lab if they wanted to. Vic and Donna looked at each other, confused. After all, why would Ratattack want any of the lab’s work? There wasn’t much here that would be particularly valuable or useful to him. Anything of note had been taken to other areas for further research or taken to companies to try and develop for industry. 

The machines decided that they were done waiting and shoved their way past Vic and Donna into the lab. Then they split up and started to tear through the lab. They dug through the paperwork, buckets of parts and binders full of old schematics, dumping everything onto the ground in a heap. 

Donna was about to raise her voice to try and stop them, but Vic gave her a look to stand down. He walked over to her and whispered, “There’s nothing here worth blowing your secret identity for. Let’s just let them look and then they’ll go.”

“Aren’t you forgetting something? Dr. Morah might have some plans for his time viewer here or something. What if they find that?”

“I’m sure he doesn’t have that stuff here. He wasn’t even willing to show it to us.”

Donna nodded nervously. “I guess…”

The RATs continued to look around the lab, looking behind the shelves, scanning white boards, searching for whatever they could find. But they couldn’t find whatever they were looking for and they turned to Vic menacingly.

“Where is Dr. Morah? We have business with him.”

Donna spoke up before Vic could say anything. “He’s not here. In fact, he’s on a trip to Germany for a conference, I don’t think he’s going to be back for another week or two.”

“Refrain from lying to us. Dr. Morah was sighted giving a lecture on campus today. He is at no conference. Where is he?”

Suddenly, the door beeped and swung open. Dr. Morah walked in, carrying boxes of paperwork. 

“Hi Vic, Donna… could you give me a hand with these boxes... Oh. What are you doing here?”

“Dr. Morah. We demand all of your research on the time machine,” the RATs said in unison.

A flash of recognition went across Dr. Morah’s face before he caught himself. “Time machine? I have no idea what you’re talking about.”

“This is not a request. Comply or be made to.”

“I promise you, I know nothing about what you are talking about.”

Meanwhile, ever since Dr. Morah walked into the lab, Donna had been slowly making over to her section of the lab. Once she was there, she grabbed a bin full of old parts and projects and began to dig through it. After a few moments, she found what she was looking for, a small handheld device that looked like a rocket thruster. She fumbled with it for a few moments, then flipped a switch on the back. 

“Hey, leave him alone!” 

She pointed the device towards the RATs and it began to hum mechanically. The RATs turned to face Donna and approached her menacingly. She let the device go and it flew through the air like a missile towards them. It collided with the first one but bounced harmlessly off the machine’s chest, not even slowing it down. 

Donna swore under her breath then started to fumble through her work area to find anything else that could stop them.  Before she could, the robots were on top of her. From some unseen compartment, it pulled out a pair of handcuffs and restrained her with them. 

Vic ran over to stop them, grabbing an old metal chair along the way and smashed it into the other RAT. It turned and faced him, unphased by the attack. 

“Please cease resistance.”

Vic looked around for anything else he could use as a weapon, but felt dispirited at his lack of options. Nothing stuck out that could do anything to them.

He held out his wrists. It wasn’t worth it.

The robot restrained him, then shoved him next to Donna. 

“Dr. Morah. We have your associates. Will you now show us your time machine?”

Dr. Morah hesitated and thought for a moment and Vic wasn’t sure if he should be offended that Dr. Morah had to think for a while about this.. But eventually he agreed.

 “Very well, follow me.”


⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙


Dr. Morah led the two robots, Vic and Donna into his office. 

“Please, turn around for a moment.”

The robots didn’t react, but Vic and Donna turned around out of politeness. Dr. Morah pressed a long series of buttons and switches over the next thirty or so seconds, walking to all sorts of corners of his office to locate the next one.Vic had no idea where he could be hiding those and was sure every time that that would be the last button. But time and time again, there was another. Finally, a hidden passage opened up on the floor next to his desk.

“Thank you for indulging me, you may turn around now. Follow me down here and watch your step. The ramp can be slick at times.”

The robots pushed Donna and Vic forward and they squeezed themselves down the narrow tunnel. The tunnel was fairly vintage looking, reminding Vic of some of the older parts of campus from the 60s. Its old, fluorescent lights in metal cages shined a dim yellow light on the glazed ceramic tiles that lined the narrow walls.

“I think this used to be a path to a nuclear bunker,” Dr. Morah explained. “It appears to be designed in that sort of style but I was never able to confirm its intended use. Regardless, it has proved to be a useful space to me since my “official” lab is a little small and public for the work that I do.”

*‘What did he mean by that? Surely he didn’t just say that to fill the dead air, right? But then why? Maybe there’s some sort of hidden meaning?’*

Vic stopped to think for a moment until the RAT pushed him forwards again. He could start to see some brighter, LED lights shining from down the tunnel. Then, it hit him. 

*‘Oh, duh. He’s telling me that we’re going to his underground lab that I saw a couple years ago. ([Cyborg 39!](https://www.reddit.com/r/DCFU/comments/xf675c/cyborg_39_anyway_the_wind_blows/)) But why? Is he telling me to slip out into the other entrance into the tunnels? Or does he want me to try and lure the robots in there so he can escape with the device?I never saw the device itself before, unless it was just the TV. So maybe it’s small? Guess I’ll have to play it by ear, but I can’t imagine Dr. Morah wants me to just leave the device to the RATs… So it has to be the latter…’*

Finally, they arrived. They stood on a metal balcony that circled around the entire room, overlooking the lab below. The lab was filled with work benches, manufacturing equipment and raw materials, but what caught Vic’s eye was the TV in the middle, almost exactly where he last saw it. New this time were thick cables that ran between the TV and a dense, cubed shaped computer with blinking lights about the size of a coffee table. 

Vic knew he only had seconds to decide what he was going to do. Donna and him could probably carry the device together, or maybe just him if it wasn’t as heavy as it looked. They’d have to carry it back up the stairs to the balcony before they could even start to lose the robots. But that would be pretty much impossible and Dr. Morah would’ve known that.

*‘So, he must’ve just wanted us to try and get out of here.’*

Vic scanned the room and his eyes locked on to the tunnel that Gar used to break in last time ([Cyborg 39 again!](https://www.reddit.com/r/DCFU/comments/xf675c/cyborg_39_anyway_the_wind_blows/)). It was pretty much on the exact opposite of the side of the room, but if he could get going - 

“Move. Dr. Morah, prepare the device for transport.”

The robot snapped him back to reality only for Vic to disappear back into his head. 

*‘I can’t just let them have the device. Dr. Morah won’t like it, but I’d rather destroy it first. I don’t know what Ratattack would do with knowledge of the future but it can’t be good. And it’ll  just make him that much harder to take down.’*

With new resolve, Vic followed close behind Dr. Morah. 

“I’m going to break the machine.” Vic whispered.

“Don’t,” Dr. Morah said without even turning around.

“Why?”

“No talking,” the RAT barked out.

Finally approaching the device, Vic was confused. Would Dr. Morah really rather it be used by someone like Ratattack instead of destroying it? Vic couldn’t agree, even if Dr. Morah would never forgive him.

The three humans stood in a semi circle around the screen with the RATs standing behind and between each of them. 
“Is this the device? Show us; prove its functionality.”

Dr. Morah walked over to it and flipped a power switch in the back. “What do you want to see? How about this: in three minutes, I will raise my right hand, with my left hand resting on the TV.”

“Adequate.” 

Dr. Morah fiddled with the dials for a few seconds then the TV flickered to life. But it didn’t seem like it was showing this lab. It showed a smokey room, with only a handful of dim red lights showing that the TV was even on. 

Dr. Morah looked at it, confused. “Strange. I am sure I have it set correctly…”

Then, the room descended into chaos.

The room was plunged into darkness as the power was cut, the red emergency lights flickering on in an instant. Four metallic objects clanged against the concrete floor, then, with a hiss, they started to release smoke into the room. 

Vic wasn’t sure who was doing this, but he wasn’t going to let it go to waste. He lurched forwards towards the machine. His hands still bound, he tried to kick it, hoping to knock it over. But he felt it barely even move, to his surprise. 

“That you Vic? Figured you’d be here.” 

Vic was confused and was trying to place the voice since he couldn’t see them at all. The nasally, smug voice sounded familiar but he couldn’t put a name to it or see them in the dark, smoky air.

“Who’re you?”

“Can’t believe you forgot me, Vic. That’s pretty cold. I get it’s been awhile, but c’mon. Anyway, I can’t let you break the time machine. I’ve got some people who are very, very interested in it.”

While the person was talking, Vic heard massive footsteps behind him running towards him. One of the RATs, maybe both. He wasn’t sure how much they could see in the smoke, but he knew where they were running. He stepped to the otherside of the TV to get out of their way, barely dodging some sort of energy beam from the mysterious stranger. In the brief flash of light, he got a look at his face.

“Gizmo?”

“Hey Vic. Glad you haven’t completely forgotten me. One sec.”

Gizmo shot another salvo of rounds at the RATs but they didn’t even finch, continuing to charge at him. The closer one grabbed at Mikron, but he tapped a button on his chest and activated his spider mech, launching him up out of range as the eight metallic legs jutted out onto the ground. But it barely even bought him a moment as the RAT grabbed the leg of the mech, crunching it and knocking Gizmo off balance.

He retracted the mech again, then jumped off the shoulder of the RAT towards Vic. 

“Well, that’s a bust. Time for plan B - run!”

The lights flickered back on, illuminating the smokey room.

“We’re out of time. Was hoping to take advantage of this a little longer but I need you at full speed.”

Gizmo grabbed a small device about the size of a pen from his waist and shot it at Vic’s hands, freeing him.

Donna ran over, waving her bound arms in front of her. “Me too please?”

Gizmo obliged. 

“Now, go!”

Gizmo, Vic and Donna ran out of the lab, the smoke barely obscuring them at all. Once they reached the balcony, they turned around and saw that the RATs weren’t even following them. But that didn’t stop them from running until they were all the back at the surface, where they finally caught their brief with a huge sigh of relief. 



⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙


Thirty minutes later, Vic’s apartment.

Gizmo - Mikron- wore a dark green jumpsuit that had various burns and patches on it and black combat boots.  He was still the short guy that Vic remembered him as but his face was harder, more confident than before. He kicked them off at the door then laid down on Vic’s couch.

“Nice place you got here, Vic.”

“Uh… thanks.” 

Vic and Donna sat in the armchairs on either side of Mikron.

“So, uh, Vic, you want to explain who this is?” Donna asked.

“Y'know, I was wondering the same thing, Vic. Who’s she?”

“Yeah Vic, who am I?” Donna teased.

“That’s, uh, my girlfriend, Donna. And Donna, that’s Mikron aka Gizmo. He’s a guy that I went to high school with that became… sort of a criminal that I worked with and fought before? Mikron, you can probably describe yourself better but that's close enough.”

Mikron laughed. “Yeah. That’s close enough.”

“So, Mikron, what are you doing here?” Vic asked.

“Well, my boss heard about that time machine and wants it. So I’m going to get it for them.”

“Just that easy? No issues with stealing an all knowing device?”

Mikron shrugged. “Not really. I’ve got a decent amount of trust in my boss and honestly it doesn't matter what they do with it. These jobs are paying me more than most people make in a lifetime.”

“What would happen if you didn’t get it?”

“Not much. I just don’t get paid. My boss isn’t a monster.”

“Okay, so I’ve got a proposal for you then.”


“I’m stopping you there, Vic. I’m not helping you save the city.That’s not me. I’m here to get the device and go.”

Donna spoke up. “Well, now you’re trying to rob a guy who can see the future. Can’t see that working too well.”

Mikron shrugged again. “You’ve got me there.” 

“So how about this? We help you steal the time machine, you help us take down Ratattack. Win win,” Donna said.

Vic shot her a look and Donna responded with a wink. 

*‘She must have some sort of plan. I don’t like this, but there really isn’t a better option. Guess I’ve just got to trust her.’*

“Hmmm…. I’ll do it on one condition. Vic owes me a no questions asked, favor.”
“No way. I’m not just going to be your weapon for a day. We barely know each other anymore and who knows what you’d make me do.”

“Okay, how about some questions asked. No murder, nothing too reprehensible for the golden boy. Promise.”

Vic groaned. “Fine. We can’t do this without you and if that’s what it takes, that’s what it takes. But you better not screw me on this.”

Mikron smirked. “Trust me, I won’t. But this is going to be the start of a beautiful partnership.”

After 9 months I have been released from the shackles of candida and gardnerella. 

What worked for me:
Stool sample and blood test both showed candida. Get these tests done immediately. 

Diet- in total I did this diet STRICT. No cheating, for 4 months straight. The only things I ate were steaks, chicken, fish, eggs, sometimes lamb, green veggies, cauliflower, breakfast sausage with 0 sugars added, coconut milk chia seed pudding (only ingredients are chia seeds and unsweetened canned coconut milk) for snacks almonds, walnuts, pecans, hazelnuts, macadamia nuts, and harvest snap pea crisps (these saved me). Basically carnivore diet but with veggies and nuts. I drank unsweet green tea and matcha with almond milk but no sweetener. Don’t drink coffee as it can have mold present. No dairy (no oat milk, other nut milks are fine), no grains, no potatoes, and 0 sweets no form of sweeteners or fruits. The last month I started incorporating blueberries, green apples, and grapefruit as these are low in sugars. ZERO ALCOHOL

Not gonna lie, as a 22 year old with a social life, this was the most miserable 4 months of my life. I couldn’t go out with my friends or boyfriend, had to stay home a lot of the time to cook my own meals. It sucked. But it was so worth it.

During this I took Candibactin AR, 2 capsules a day in the morning with 2 capsules of Caprylic acid until I used up the candibactin jar. Warning u might almost poop your pants once u start taking this but it’s normal lol. After that my naturalpath put me on 2 months of fluconazole. (200mg x a day) I started this 2 months into my diet after I finished the other supplements. It sounds scary but we tested my liver function twice during this time and it actually increased since my first blood draw. 

Towards the end of my fluconazole we did an at home send off vaginal microbiome test. Lactobacillus count should be around 70-90% of your vaginal microbiome. Mine was 70% gardnerella, 20% lactobacillus, gardnerella is also known as the cause of BV or bacterial vaginosis. He then gave me 10 days of metronidazole gel and after the gel I used SEED VS01 vaginally inserted probiotics to bring me back to a healthy vaginal microbiome. I’ve also started taking a spoonful of coconut cult in the morning for probiotics. It’s been 2 months since and I’m free of all vaginal itching and burning and I feel fantastic!!!!


Some extra things to know: 
-if your partner is a male, demand they get treated for BV if you are getting treated for it to. I don’t care what your doctors say, men can and will give it back to you! Fight for yourself!! 
-stop wearing tampons!!! Pads only and cotton underwear only. Also wash your underwear in scent free detergent. 
-if your partner is guilt tripping you about sex during this time, I do not say this lightly, they are not the person for you. You cannot control this, i would not wish it on anybody. I am so thankful I had an understanding boyfriend throughout all of this, and a boyfriend who did everything and anything to make sure I got the proper care I needed. (This goes for friendships too, while my friends never fully understood what was going on, they never judged me for it or made me feel bad for missing fun events) 
-after all of this, I will never go back to the old way I was eating and I have a new appreciation for the things I put in my body. I believe this all stemmed from a lot of sugars and a lot of carbs as well as excess drinking from when I was in college. My dessert now consists of a couple pieces of dark chocolate instead of a slice of cake or a whole bag of grapes. I also have been gluten free since this whole issue started and I think I’m going to continue that. And I intend to keep eating as clean as possible. 

If you have any questions, please feel free to ask!!! I hope this helps some of you and gives you hope, I remember months ago scrolling on reddit reading success stories and thinking I’ll never have one of my own. This experience was incredibly isolating, and I am extremely sorry for any of you that are going through this. I promise if you buckle down and push through it will get better❤️ ",5,1742759476.0,Candida,0,1.0,False

I'd been craving coffee oreo icecream and we finally drove to a shop about an hour away to get some. We had a lovely afternoon, eating ice creams and sundaes and walking by the sea shore. I went to sleep a very happy person last night. 
This morning, I was still in the coffee oreo happy daze (trust me, the ice cream was that good) when a dining table set was delivered to our home. I'd been looking to get a proper dining table for a while, and finally found a decent one that was in our budget. My husband brought the boxes inside and we opened them up to assemble the whole thing. The minute we opened up the box that contained the table, I knew it was too small, smaller than what I expected anyway. When we put together the table, I burst into tears and cried away for about 5-7 minutes because it wasn't what I envisaged it to be. My husband, poor, gentle soul, was so lost by the turn of events, he didn't know what to do to calm me down. After I sobbed for a good 3-4 minutes, he put the tools down and came over and hugged me and said it's okay, we can get another one if you want. Later, after I stopped crying and had some food, I realized it's such a silly thing to feel so emotionally about and ended up apologizing to my husband, who only smiled and patted my head.

Anyone else want to share their reasons for crying at the weirdest thing today and make me feel like I'm not the only crazy one?

Edit: about 5 minutes after posting this, with the displeasure on my face very apparent, my husband came up to me and said if I wanted, we could convert the table into a changing table for the baby🥹🥹🥹

He has a podcast called The Ultimate Human. Not only does he have and interview with Dr. Barbara Sturm who is a dermatologist That has developedan entire line of products, from face cleansers and serums to laundry soap, all with the intention of eliminating the bad and using only the best ingredients. Her products can be expensive. I know I can not afford them yet so I can not say that I have tried any. My point for the recommendation is the facts provided in the podcast can help lead to more informative decisions when choosing your skin care products. Also, The Ultimate Human podcast has titles and interviews covering so many interesting topics from water, coffee, seed oil and alcohol. Sooooo many more. It’s all back by scientific research with references provided. It has changed my life. Give it a look. The skin care podcast is number 63 I believe. i am adding the link, I hope!

Hey r/Entrepreneur!

I've been obsessed with figuring out how Yelp maintains accurate data on millions of businesses despite constant changes in hours, locations, and services. After diving deep into their systems, I discovered some fascinating strategies that ANY digital entrepreneur can apply to their own projects.

*This isn't just interesting tech trivia - these are actionable insights for anyone building platforms, marketplaces, or data-driven businesses.*

**TL;DR: Yelp's Business Directory Magic**
* Combines multiple data sources (public records, third-party databases, and proprietary methods)
* Leverages 18.1M monthly user contributions through reviews, photos, and updates
* Uses advanced ML algorithms to detect patterns and inconsistencies
* Creates win-win verification through Yelp for Business tools
* Implements continuous feedback loops between users, businesses and systems

## The Hidden Data Collection Machine

Yelp doesn't just wait for businesses to sign up. They've built a **multi-pronged approach** that's honestly brilliant:

1. **Foundation layer** - They aggregate data from public records, business registrations, phone directories, and website crawling
2. **Specialized partnerships** - They tap into industry-specific databases (healthcare providers, reservation systems, etc.)
3. **Geographic verification** - Mapping technologies confirm addresses and detect duplicates

This creates an initial layer that's already more robust than most directories ever achieve.

## The Passive Crowdsourcing Goldmine

The TRUE genius is what Yelp calls ""passive crowdsourcing"" - where users inadvertently maintain data quality while simply using the platform:

* **Reviews contain factual nuggets** - ""They've extended weekend hours"" or ""They've added outdoor seating""
* **User photos reveal business details** - Their image recognition can extract pricing, hours from door signs, and service offerings
* **""Suggest an Edit"" feature** - Turns every user into a potential data contributor

I tested this myself by reporting a permanently closed business during a road trip. Within hours, the listing was updated with a ""Permanently Closed"" banner!

## Algorithm Magic That's Actually Useful

Behind that simple interface is a network of algorithms constantly processing data:

* **Machine learning for pattern identification** - If a coffee shop suddenly lists 3PM as opening time, the system flags potential errors
* **NLP extracts structured data from text** - Picking up on phrases like ""They're now closed on Mondays""
* **Data reconciliation algorithms** - Resolve conflicts when multiple sources provide contradictory information

They also have sophisticated systems to detect fake reviews and manipulated listings, using both AI and human moderation teams.

## How They Get Businesses To Actually Participate

Rather than seeing listing management as a chore, Yelp creates real incentives for business participation:

* **Enhanced profile features** - Businesses that actively manage listings get to add menus, bios, and service descriptions
* **Analytics access** - The business dashboard provides engagement metrics and competitive insights
* **Review response capabilities** - Direct interaction with customers
* **Promotional opportunities** - Complete listings become eligible for featured placement

## The Continuous Improvement System

Instead of periodic updates, Yelp built sophisticated continuous improvement systems:

* **Differential update frequencies** - Restaurants get checked more often than museums
* **Confidence scoring** - Each data point gets a reliability rating based on source, recency, and consistency
* **Regular data quality audits** - Random samples undergo comprehensive verification

## What This Means For You

If you're building any kind of platform, marketplace, or directory, these principles are gold:

1. **Combine multiple data sources** instead of relying on just one
2. **Turn users into inadvertent contributors** through normal platform usage
3. **Create mutual benefits** that encourage everyone to maintain accuracy
4. **Build continuous improvement systems** rather than periodic updates
5. **Layer automated and human verification** for maximum reliability

---

What's your take on this? Have you built systems that use similar approaches for maintaining data quality? Or if you're working on a platform now, which of these principles could you implement first?

Initially, looking for something casual / short term as I am visa approved to move from UK to Canada solo.
*context* 
Been single almost 2 years, after long-term relationship ended.. Spent so long doing the typical partying, one-night stand not coping while also thinking I was gonna get back with my ex. Last year, after realising he moved on, I was heartbroken. Finally grieved the relationship. I healed, embraced independence, solo trips (holidays, day trips etc). Really changed as a person - for the better. Dabbled in dating but nobody ever got past a 1st date (not sure was it always them or me lol)
Dealt with a close death in the family at the time of my breakup (my BIL, leaving my sis a widow and their kids) at the same time (still living at home) so the consequence of those have changed what it’s like living at home. I’m also finishing uni (late to go) so I was wanting a fresh start away. I decided in December to apply for my visa and was approved by early Feb and had my flight booked for early September within a week.

Fast forward to a few weeks ago, meet this guy on hinge (my move is disclosed in bio) so we even mention it in our initial convo.
Went on a first date and it was one of the best first dates ever. We chatted the whole time, pub hopping and just getting to know one another over a few drinks. No awkwardness, giddy and laughing by the end of it. Had another date similar a week later. We met 2 days later for a coffee and a trip to the cinema, I was thinking maybe it was the alcohol.
After more dates I’m not even joking when I say this man has completely surprised me. We get on so well, he’s made me feel safe and able to open up. He seems very keen and would be really complimentary (In a non degrading way). We waited 5 dates before sleeping together, went down the country for a night and I knew this was a bad idea considering I don’t wanna be attached. Has asked to be exclusive, told me he’s spoken to his friends / barber which I just feel he’s into me quite a bit - I’ve never been in a situation where I’ve not done the chasing (I was also anxious attached but healed independent queen over here)

I think I’ve been avoiding my feels because I don’t want to be attached but I feel I already am. We’ve openly spoken about the move and I think we’re both hating how it’s even a thing. I feel like I’ve known him years. 
He can’t come to Canada as he used a whv during his uni years. He also has elderly separated parents as an only child so he doesn’t want to go far (which I get).

I know I need to give it more time but I can’t even get excited about the move anymore, I’m really starting to like him and honestly after my last relationship I never thought I’d want to be with someone again. I need to still give it the 3 month mark but as much as i’m trying to find a fault to end it I really can’t. Time is ticking for my move and my head is scrambled.

I want a fresh start, but I’m not sure if it’s the move anymore. 

Has anyone been in this situation or could offer some advice?

I am looking to play Rey while you will play Kylo Ren/Ben Solo. I've been on hiatus for a bit due to my work schedule changing, but my love for this ship has not died a bit and I'm still craving to write it desperately. I'm mainly looking to write AUs (medieval, avatar!au, slice of life, coffee shop, college, etc.) but I can be persuaded to play in canonverse if the plot is interesting!

A little about me:
* 25F, married and does not take flirty personalities kindly.
* Ghost friendly and patient, don't be afraid to let me know if you aren't interested anymore or if you want to start something different.
* 13 years of roleplay experience. Consider myself 'advanced literate', replies ranging from 350 ~ 1.5k words depending on the scene and partner comfortability. Third POV writer. (First POV is ok!)
* Eastern Standard Time, generally not available in the late PM.
* Able to write via Reddit Messages (chat for plotting,) GDocs, Discord, and Email. Whichever floats your boat.
* Able to reply Sundays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. (Never Saturdays and Mondays, usually not Thursdays.) Depending on your speed, I'm able to get 2-3 replies out per day. Again, depends on your own reply pace.
* I am open for rapid-fire on Sundays ONLY, though they must be scheduled in advanced. (Preferably a week.)

What I'm searching for in a partner:
* The ability to write 350 or more words per response. Nothing less, please. Third POV preferred, but I am capable of First POV.
* Patience and understanding, though don't be afraid to end our roleplay if you find my schedule is too much.
* Again, interested and able to play Kylo Ren/Ben Solo against my Rey. Unfortunately, not interested in playing him at this time.
* Between the ages of 20 and 40. Not particularly interested in writing with teens, and I haven't quite found the comfort in roleplaying with anyone older than 40.
* A plotter with interest in pushing their own ideas and collaborating. I do not work well with people who don't put their own thoughts in, don't let me steamroll.

I am now more aware of why certain things are the way they are for me, but also need to start with treatment and well.. it feels like a whole new world has opened up. It came with a lot of relief, but also roads to still travel if it makes sense?

I don't have that now and I feel like something inside me is yelling like an unreasonable child: I WANT MY BOYFRIEND!!!  *Stomp stomp*

It is incredibly frustrating, confusing and just stressful and I don't know why. I don't know how it makes sense and I don't really know how to selfsooth.

for some background: i dont drive, and i cant get a doctor to see me to sign my handicap placard for my mom’s car, so i take the public bus everywhere. most of the busses in my city are equipped with one qstraint automatic quantum station and two 4-point tie down systems. i never prefer the quantum stations because they are all facing backwards and make my car sickness pretty bad. the stop request buttons next to them take way too much finger strength for me to safely use, and bus drivers always yell at me for just pulling the stop request wire instead. both work for a stop request, but the button sends a signal to the bus driver to enable the other button that allows me to lock/unlock the quantum q’straint. i have enough upper body flexibility and a low enough backrest to hook myself up to the 4 point tiedowns myself (most the time), but it’s always a pain in the ass asking drivers to let me, so most the time i just use the quantum. 

the other day, i was on my way home from the library where i go to study. bus pulls up, driver unfolds the ramp, and then i show her my bus card and roll onto the bus. i see that the seats above the tiedown stations are folded down, so i roll into the quantum station. i press the button to engage the system, and it flashes red. this usually doesnt happen, but when it does happen its because a driver assumes they need to help me get into position, so they escort me to the station, make sure im positioned, say something like “oh cool! you got it yourself!” before going back to their seat and engaging the lock system from their dashboard. then they check in to make sure im secure, ask if i need a lapbelt, ask if i’m sure when i say i dont need help putting on my lapbelt, give me a thumbs up, and drive off. overly long routine for me, but im sure they’re taught to do all this since the majority of wheelchair users who use the city bus in my area are elderly, so i cant complain too much. i rather be slightly annoyed every now and then than have someone injured because they couldnt properly secure themselves without help. 

so i’m sitting here, trying to press this button, and it is flashing red and beeping. i turn around to tell the driver she needs to unlock the button for me, but before i can even yell loud enough for her to hear me she is ZOOMING. i catch myself on the slings hanging from the ceiling railing (those things people hold onto while standing on the bus). i didnt even get a chance to put on the seatbelt, or even lock my rear wheels!! my chair doesnt have a seatbelt, so the only thing keeping me onto it was the lapstacker that was holding my stuffed animal to my lap (i carry a dog plush with me everywhere, i never leave the house without one) (important side note: do not use a lapstacker as a seatbelt, that is not what it is intended for and should not be relied on as such). 

for a good 3.5 miles, im clinging onto this ceiling railing for dear life, all while my chair is rolling around the bus floor. i have ehlers danlos, and it has severely impaired my ability to safely bare weight on my hips, knees, and ankles since i was about 11 or 12 years old. physical therapy worsened my condition. so during all this, i am bracing the weight of my moving chair with my hips and lower back while trying to keep myself in place. at this point, the many many others on the bus notice, and this driver manages to ignore ALL of their attempts at getting her attention. i am scared for my life, and being autistic with selective mutism, i find it near impossible to even scream out anymore. im stuck frozen and silent. 

the driver makes a turn, and my chair turns as well. my body is twisted past a 90° angle at this point. i get an extremely, excruciatingly painful tingly jab shooting in my middle spine area (where my body twisted). i think i overextended it? idk. but i begin crying because it hurts so bad. a girl around my age makes a stop request, walks up to the driver station, and tells the driver. driver turns around and sees me in the state i’m in, and has the audacity to ask why im not locked into the station?? like bro. someone tells her that the button wouldnt work (everyone saw it flashing red) and she goes, “oh, that’s okay.” FYM THAT’S OKAY?? NO IT IS NOT????

i get back into the station and she locks it for me from her dashboard. 15-ish minutes later, when i get to my stop, the same thing happens. i cant unlock myself and she gets ready to start driving off. i turn around and instead of politely telling her with a loud voice, i just straight up scream. i did not want to risk her not hearing me again. she turns around and i tell her i need to leave and i cant unlock myself. she tells me, “oh, yeah i need to do it for you.”

so, if she *knew* i couldnt engage the machine without her allowing me to from her dashboard, WHY did she not do so when i got on? and then WHY did she ask me why i wasnt locked in when she saw me flinging everywhere?? it pissed me off so much i couldnt even ask her about it, i just left the bus and went home.

the part of my spine that was “tweaked” is hurting so much to the point where i cant even sit up comfortably. i have a low backrest because ive only really struggled with support in my lower back area. the “tweak” is just above where my backrest sits. the pain is shooting through my shoulders now and i cant even unscrew anything without pain. my mom has arthritis and cant help me either. i cant even reach out to a doctor right now (reasons i dont wanna talk about). i just want to sit and enjoy my coffee in peace. i want to cry.",3,1742758853.0,wheelchairs,0,1.0,False

1ji7qd9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1ji7qd9/husband_wants_space_after_argument_wife_doesnt/,"Husband wants space after argument, wife doesn’t agree with it.","My (32 F) husband (36 M) and I had a few days here we were arguing. I didn’t think much of it because people get mad at each other and get over it. My husband has a different perspective and came to me asking for space. As well as set new boundaries in our relationship. He said he needs space. I asked if he wanted one of us to be removed from our place and he said no. But, the space he needs kinda disrespects my views of marriage. Prior to this last fight we would constantly call each other everyday after work/school (just to talk about the day) and text each other our where-abouts. Since the space, if I text him it’s cold or no response. If he leaves the house before I wake up he would usually send a text saying where he went and see you home later. Now nothing. It’s only been a few days, but I feel like this goes against my definition of a marriage. I’m fine with space, but we are still married—so we should still act like it? Am I wrong? He also asked me to not cook for him anymore since one argument we got into recently was that I got upset because we were going out to eat and I was hangry and he asked me to pick, I blew up because I make 90% of our meals(we mostly eat dinner together and some breakfast on the weekends), if I don’t offer to cook we just wouldn’t eat. I told him when I blew up that it would be nice sometimes if he could suggest a meal or place to eat. It’s draining for one person to make that decision constantly. And I get upset with him when he decides because it’s usually McDonald’s and as a grown woman it does upset me. I would like my husband to suggest healthy meals, not what I view as lazy. I also get on him for vaping, which I think is terrible and he tells me he’s a grown man and can do whatever he wants. I tell him that he should care about his health because I want to grow old with him and his vape will cut that short. He said he’s miserable with me and that I don’t give him any physical touch. I do, but I feel like it’s not good enough for him..well I know it’s not. He also set new boundaries financially. For context, I am a full-time nursing student and I work one night a week, every two weeks. (This is enough to cover my own bills). Nursing school is draining and even that schedule is hard because I do have homework, papers, exams weekly. I commute 2-3 hours a day depending on traffic. My husband pays for all our shared expenses which is something we agreed on before I went back to school. I do pay our phone bill and my personal credit card payments. My husband has always allowed me to buy myself something extra every now and then on his card whether that’s a coffee or something extra for myself. Mind you I’m very busy with school so this occurs maybe once or twice a month. Ie, last month I got myself a skirt ($80) and two bags at a local pop-up ($140) and he did take my best friend and myself out for drinks. I’m not out here spending crazy money. But, back to my point as per his new “boundaries” he said if I wanted something extra I need to, “pick up a shift at work.” I’m not a materialistic person, but that really angered me out of principle. I feel like I’m in a vulnerable spot being in school and for him to use that seemed really wrong. We also had a vacation planned and he cancelled it. He also called me a c-word and a narcissist to my face yesterday. We have called each other a-holes or “you’re being a d!Cj or a-hole,” but being called a c-word felt different. Everything I do is with my husband in mind.  I am bitchy at times, but I don’t think it’s anything unusual. Just the normal frustrations I mentioned above. I feel like this space is helpful for him, but damaging for me. I feel like I lost all safety in my marriage. I don’t know what to do.

The clatter of train over tracks had fallen into an ambient comfort for Isak the past few days. One that had done little for his insomnia though that had started before he embarked on the first train. By extreme luck, 10rain’s shift had ended once the steam crawler had arrived at the first town with a rail line and she already had plans to ride a similar route as Isak. As she preferred to travel in a private compartment she offered to let Isak join her rather than leaving him to general seating. And though those seats looked comfortable enough out there, Isak had to admit that having a plush bench seat to sleep on was a much welcomed luxury for long rides.

One that 10rain was currently taking advantage of on the opposing seat.

In appreciation of such kindness, Isak had constructed a small reading fort out of his knees and a spare blanket to contain the light of his magelight lantern. Crude, but it ensured that the sleeping 10rain wasn’t bothered by the bright light that would otherwise fill the small compartment. And it allowed Isak to get plenty of research done in absolutely vital topics that would ensure his adjustment to living in a completely new environment for most of the year.

Research like what other young mages really lived like.

This was the third book that 10rain had bought him at the last train station and the young protagonist was already facing his fifteenth exciting, life changing face-off against nefarious forces. Sure, that was a bit more than some of the other novels Isak had read over the years but *this* book took place in the Capital province. That was where the biggest of big things happened. Where the fate of the world was decided. The place where all other history was made and flowed from.

That is to say, very much not the edge of civilization. Isak sighed and closed the book. Perhaps ‘rock bottom’ was indeed where he was starting. But in a few days it *was* starting. Just keep quiet and rise through the ranks before anyone realizes you have a joke of a familiar, Isak told himself.

He sat for a while and stared out the window into black nothingness with only glimpses of small lights in the distance. 10rain startled herself awake with a jolt, then glanced around the compartment in a hurry.

“Are you okay?” Isak asked.

The copijcha blinked several times before sitting up. She hadn’t bothered with a blanket, claiming she could sleep just about anywhere without issue. “I should be asking you the same. What are you doing awake so…”

She glanced out the window and squinted at the dark.

“Late.”

“Early.”

“What are you doing awake so early?”

“Too anxious for school, *mom*.” Time on road and rail together had Isak grow familiar enough with the copijcha woman to act more casual around her. A state that he always seemed to end up at with most of the adults in his life.

“*Tía* will do.” They had mostly used Clear Speech while on the train after Isak insisted on brushing up despite 10rain’s insistence that his command of the language was excellent. Occasional dips into Wastelander served as an emphasis. “But my niece will be thrilled that you’re already warming up to the idea of being family.”

Isak felt heat rising to his face. “I knew accepting those books was a trap…”

“Those were payment for helping me win that bet.” She corrected while idly adjusting her feathers after having just woken up. “How have you enjoyed them so far?”

“They’re good! Really fun reads….hey can I ask you something?”

“Mages look after one another. Ask anything.”

“Did anyone ever…make fun of you for having a rat?” Isak’s eyes drifted over to where his luggage was stored overhead, and where his ‘familiar’ sat inside. “As a familiar I mean.”

“Of course.” The copijcha’s bluntness knocked the wind out of Isak. She shrugged and continued. “They were just jealous that Bones could sneak around almost anywhere undetected. How many can claim that their familiar can fit in their pocket for easy transport?”

Isak was unconvinced that such a thing was a benefit when your familiar was also incapable of sneaking. Or movement. Or thought.

“Why, one time in mage school another girl was making fun of my hips because she was a jealous wretch. So I challenged her to a duel, and as soon as it started I cast a paralysis spell through Brones!” 10rain broke into laughter at the memory. “He snuck up on her while I was calling for the duel! Ah, she took one step, was paralyzed, and fell face first into the dirt.”

Her laughter came to an abrupt halt as she seemed to remember herself and looked to the bemused human across from her. A serious mood, at least as best Isak could tell on her avian face, quickly overtook her.

“Isak I want to be very clear about something.” The young mage leaned in while paying close attention. “Never, and I mean *never*, under any circumstances make fun of a woman’s wide hips. They’re *egglaying* hips and it’s a sign of fertility!”

The young human stared in confusion at *that* being the apparent moral of the story. Perhaps all mages had an odd side? “That wasn’t–...I uh…won’t ever do that. Who considers that a bad thing anyway?”

She clicked her beak before answering. “*Some* mammals, no offense, have ridiculous beauty standards.”

Even if Isak considered wide hips on girls to be the very opposite of a bad thing, there was no non-weird way to mention that now. The conversation could only derail further. An event that Isak wanted to avoid on this train if at all possible given recent revelations about how puns seemingly ruled his life.

Instead, he gave 10rain a serious look and nodded. “I promise to take your advice to heart. Also uh, how common are those duels?”

The copijcha counted on her claws and silently moved her beak. “A several per year, at least at my school. One happens and then it scares off the unserious from following suit.”

“....and this was okay?”

“There’s nothing wrong with a duel as long as it’s official and all necessary precautions are taken.”

In the books that Isak had read recently, a blood mage was always present in any duels that started. Looking back it was all presented as if it was the most obvious thing. Which meant that this was an incredibly obvious question he had just asked.

“Well…yeah of course.” Isak feigned knowledge of this fact. “Just wanted to be sure.”

“Asking questions is how you learn, Isak.” 10rain said, seeing right through him. “Be without fear in your pursuit of knowledge.”

Easier said than done, but Isak nodded back anyway. The train’s whistle sounded and 10rain stood from her seat to slightly open the sliding door. Bones the rat scampered in and the door was shut behind him. 10rain scooped him up and deposited the small familiar in a pocket on her dress. She didn’t give the human time to ask what kind of adventure the rat had just been on. “Sounds like you’re almost to Majra. And you made it with a few days to spare!”

The sparse lights of night had been growing denser as they raced by outside. Outer farmlands giving way to urban sprawl. Paved streets lit by lamp lights the likes of which Isak had only seen in illustrations. Buildings that seemed big enough to hold every person in his home village. Isak cursed his night time arrival that kept him from seeing more than glimpses speeding by in lamplight. When they finally pulled into the station 10rain walked him to the door while the other passengers disembarked.

“Until our paths cross again, Isak.” 10rain said with a friendly wave as Isak stepped off the train with luggage in tow. “Take the world by…*storm*.”

Isak rolled his eyes. “That was forced!”

“I’m a storm mage and it is my right.”

The young human’s mouth hung open as other passengers made their way around him. “You’re a *what?* Why didn’t you tell me?!?”

“You didn’t ask!” Were the last words she said before vanishing back onto the train to continue the ride until her destination.

Isak hurried along before he caught too many dirty looks for standing around blocking the way. The train station itself was a mix of people hurrying in one direction or another or waiting in some place that *didn’t* block anyone’s path. Of the people here Isak observed that it was far more diverse than he was used to. It was still mostly humans with an appropriately proportionate amount of minotaur, but outside of the rare travelling theater troupe the young mage was already experiencing mild culture shock at the diversity of non-humans just at this train station.

Some even had what were obviously familiars following after them.

Was this a notable train station? Or was this just how it was when you weren’t hidden away on the edge of the Wastes? Either way Isak reminded himself to stop standing around staring and start finding himself ways to keep busy for the next few days. At this time of night the train station was quiet and sedate. High ceilings with beautifully carved stonework that would normally turn every word into an echo had little to work with.

Mild panic started to creep at the edges of Isaks’ mind as the reality of being completely on his own to navigate the rest of the journey to Black Reef Institute set in. He fished around in his knapsack for his acceptance letter and all the materials that had been mailed with it. It had included the itinerary and documentation to show to various clerks to gain compensated tickets to his ultimate destination. Hurriedly reading through the instructions it appeared that he actually had a meal voucher to redeem here before a walk to the portal hub.

With tamale in hand and directions from the train station staff, Isak was on his way. He struggled to not gawk at the large buildings looming tall over him. Even if he saw them from the train it was another matter entirely to be walking amongst them. The overly early hour worked to his advantage as the streets were mostly empty. No one to see how obviously out of place he was in simple clothes staring at everything with amazement.

What the young mage did start to notice as he got closer to his destination was that most people he saw here also had luggage in hand. Combined with the current time and place, Isak guessed that these were also travellers to and from the portal hub. Some shops were even open now of all times, with patrons perusing their wares and services. Isak had stopped in front of a darkened shop to behold this strange practice and caught sight of his reflection.

Those simple clothes of his were beyond ‘humble’.

He checked his papers again for directions to where he could pick up his school uniforms. Better to look as all students do than to look horribly out of place. Isak set out for the warehouse store. After a long walk he found that the business operated all day and night. Student season gave them increased business and other companies produced uniforms for employees through them.

The size of the building was deceptive. Inside were displays of various uniforms and two bored employees who would match you with your desired fits and colors.*Except* yellow.

A middle aged man with graying looked over Isak’s documents while sipping at his coffee that had long gone cold. He told the young mage that the shade of yellow of these uniforms would make his skin look red. The red shirts, paradoxically, did no such thing. Black was reserved for looking *cool*. A cool that would be desperately needed in the tropical sun. That a school even had the option for black uniforms in the tropics came down to old imperial traditions.

And blue?

Blue was just blue. Wear blue freely. *Everyone* wore blue and it was probably the safest color in the whole empire.

All of the shirts bore a floral pattern in white for style as much as symbolism. Life and death, and a young mage’s journey to work with such forces. This particular young mage changed into his new uniforms immediately and appreciated his new *cosmopolitan* look. If he told himself that enough then it would stick.

The more the day went on, the more shops that opened up. More importantly Isak didn’t look entirely like he was from the edge of nowhere and poor enough to have the empire pay his way to school out of pity. Somewhere around the afternoon Isak had been walking around the Portal District for hours. Each successful purchase weighed him down even more in a very literal sense until he decided to finally find the portal hub itself and rest. He still had several days to get through before he was to go through that portal.

Majra’s streets in the middle of the day were completely different than at night. Carriages drawn by all manner of beasts roamed the streets. In the skies above flew large beasts both military and otherwise carrying riders around the city and to other more distant destinations. Despite isak’s meandering journey to obtain school supplies the portal hub and train station were only a short walk from one another. And in the time it would have taken Isak to walk from one to the other at this time of day he felt as though he had seen more people than he had known in his life.

Just smile and look confident, Isak told himself. Everyone around here was busy and probably wouldn’t pay him any mind as long as he looked busy too.

The portal hub itself was a building even larger than the train station with even finer architecture. How could it not be? There was far more money flowing through here than any other part of the city. People and goods from around the world coming and going in an instant through an enchanted device that was amongst The Empire’s pride and joy.

After being processed through security the building opened up into what felt like a small city under a single roof. More shops, this time focused on all possible travel needs. Amongst them a book store that was as big as Inicios’ library. Which Isak realized was hardly a notable feat now that he thought about it. He inevitably found himself in the fiction section. There would be all the time in the world for studying on the other side of that portal. For now he needed some fictional tales to disappear into for a few days.

Usually i’d take no kiss by now as a bad sign, but I’m not actually sure. We met on Hinge, and hit it off immediately via text, she actually gave me her number without me asking, and we talked for a few more days and then planned to get drinks. We got drinks and hit it off exceptionally well, and when the bar started to get really noisy (March madness) decided to go to a late night coffee shop. Now here’s the extenuating factor, we both started feeling sick after a bit at the coffee shop, I think it was something we ate at the bar, so she cut the date short, she was very apologetic, and I took her home. I was thinking of making a move but I thought a stomach ache that we both had would be a bad time, plus ya know she cut it short lol. 

After that we actually went on a date two days later, today. We went and got lunch and then went thrifting. She warned me before hand that she was hungover which I was fine with I saw it coming we both went out the night before and were drunk texting each other. We had a great time eating, thrifting, and talking, and I even invited her back to my place. She accepted and I gave her a tour and we were gonna watch a movie but then she said she started feeling really sick and dehydrated from the hangover and asked if she could go home. She said that she had a great time, and wanted to watch a movie but didn’t really wanna stay for two hours while she was hungover. Again I was gonna make a move but decided probably wouldn’t be a good time lol. 

Idk if I’m being dumb or not. It seems like she likes me but I guess I can’t tell and I’m kinda stressed about two dates and no kiss at all. I’m just starting to date again after a 4.5 year relationship and a 5 month hiatus from the dating pool to work on myself. I’m just wondering if I should treat this as DOA since no kiss on second date or you think maybe there’s something there. Idk usually I’d assume she was bullshitting but we connect really really well so I guess maybe I’m inclined to believe her on that stuff. Just some advice would be appreciated.

He invited me out for dinner at one of my favorite places to eat at and since I have a gluten allergy I knew this place was accommodating and I turn out for food. If you got a good spread and I know it then I'll show up. It's a fancier place but not too fancy that I would feel uncomfortable at. I have Autism and ADHD and so I already have a hard time adjusting lol if you know you know - if not then it's not really that important. I, at least, can mask well at this point in my life. 

Note: I had to pull over from driving home and I put a lot of this in my notes app on my phone so I'm going to retell this (it's past noon the next day / Sunday and this happened last night Saturday) so I'll go back and forth from my notes app info that I wrote moments after this happened to my added info in the light of the next day to hopefully make this make sense... 

I live about an hour and half away. I have an almost 16 year old daughter that I left at home so I was always going to be driving back home. We met at 6 pm and for the love of God I left the restaurant after having ENOUGH at around 8:45 pm when I yelled ""I DRINK YOUR MILKSHAKE"" at him and left. 

I know this guy from online for several years. I used to be a medium sized youtuber back in the day... I'm old now so I don't post a lot. He's a ""Fan"" from back then... and he's also a friend of my on all my social media accounts. So I know what he looks like, or at least thought I had a good idea, and I know a lot of his likes and dislikes from his posts online. So, to me, it did feel like I was going out with someone I already mostly knew and not at all like a blind date. It felt comfortable that way and I have to add that it did make me feel like a good person for giving him a chance... I don't know what that's about if that's my inflated ego or if I should discuss this in therapy but I really thought I was going into this giving this guy I would otherwise never give a chance, a chance.

He's a short king and not that attractive look and doesn't have a great job... I know these things because as I said, we've been friends online for a long time. I don't care about height or a job btw I do care that you take good care of your health - mental and physical mostly because I do and I enjoy working out with my partner. If that makes me a B then I admit it, I don't date people who are large because of this reason. I have in the past and I don't like to be yelled at for going to the gym or be shamed because I like my body. Again, I can address these issues in therapy because it wasn't that long ago I had let myself go and I'm at an age now where I need to maintain what I got to be happy and working out is a form of stimming that I just have to do or else I will get depressed. I get up at 5 am and I run 2 to 5 miles every single day rain or shine and the only times I ever miss it is if it's a blizzard. So in the last 2 months I missed 1 day of running. I also have a service job and I am active in and I don't need to work that job because my other job that makes me the most money is a writing job, which means I sit most of the time. 

He must not have posted any updated photos of himself because he was a lot larger than he said, and in the most recent photos that I could find of him. So I decided not to dwell on it and move past it but that felt like deception to me since he outright lied and told me he was active and worked out yet couldn't tell me a single gym he knows of. I told him where I work out and he could've lied and just named any gym when I asked but he couldn't even think of a name of a gym in town? Okay... since a big part of my life is working out I thought this was a huge red flag... and I haven't even gotten to the start of the date yet - let me back up.

He said he was going to sweep me off my feet. He did not. To be fair, he did say, Treat me like i've never been treated before. He succeeded. 

He picked this restaurant and showed up in a suit and tie after repeatedly telling me and insisting that I don't dress up. I didn't say anything because my default is wearing jeans and a nice sweater anyway. It's not a big deal for me. I enjoy being comfortable. So that's what I wore. I show up and do as he instructed, I asked about our reservations and the entire interaction with the hostess was WEIRD! She seemed immediately off when I told her the name the reservation was under. The place was packed. My date was no where in sight. I'm not too bothered except she's really flustered so I make a joking comment, ""Hey I drove almost 2 hours, if you don't have the reservation, I'll just order take out and eat it in the parking lot"" and her eyes met mine and she looked really sad...I'm not the best at reading people so maybe she wasn't sad but I feel like she looked sad. I took that as she thought I was a bit of a loser but she reached out and gave my hand a gentle squeeze and said, ""I don't see your reservation here"" she nervously laughed and then said, ""You can order take out if you'd like to"" or something to that affect. I said, ""Are you okay?"" I thought I might have upset her as she genuinely looked like she was going to cry and the fact she squeezed my hand made me feel like I had possibly been the cause of her upset. She quickly brushed me off saying, ""Oh I'm fine!"" and then her eyes kept shifting off to her right where the bar was at. So I say, ""Or I can eat at the bar?"" And she just nodded like she was in pain and went, ""MMMMhmmmmm,"" so I turn towards the bar and my eyes scan the entire bar, it's a bit packed in there, too. And I see a man obviously starting back at me with a giant smile on his face... first scan I do not realize this is my date but the second scan I realized... OH. MY. GOD. This is him. Panic sets in. 

You know that feeling when you are driving and someone in front of you stops short so you have to react by slamming on your breaks and while you don't hit the car and you are perfectly fine you still feel this odd electric shock that radiates throughout your body because your brain sent that signal thinking you were going to get hurt?! LOL does that happen to anyone else? Just me?? Okay well that's what happened to me when I saw him. I had a physical reaction to seeing him not because he was hideous but because he had gone out of his was to say he was physically fit, he used the words ""Athletic"" and ""Trim"" and he said he looked just like the photo he sent me which he had some grays at his temples and otherwise had dark hair, and I was expecting a beard, because he said he had one. NOPE. He was not ""Trim"", had a full gray head of hair and apparently decided to shave his beard prior to us meeting. 

He came over and immediately accused me, before saying Hi or Nice to meet you, accused me of being judgmental and said that he knew I was the type of woman that would not give him a chance if I knew what he really looked like. I laughed out loud and said, ""You look NOTHING like you said you did,"" and he looked like I slapped him on the face. He then shrugged his shoulders and took a step forward and tried to hug me so I tried to shake his hand and this all went down in front of the hostess who looked like she wanted to cry. I gave her a few embarrassed glances and then I dropped my hand and did not offer to hug him or shake his hand.

I can't recall what he said after this because he quoted a movie that I don't know of and when I didn't react he got mad and said, ""Oh I guess you don't know what movie that's from?"" and I just said no and looked at the Hostess again and then said, ""They don't have a reservation,"" hoping to use that as a way to just eff'n leave at this point. He laughed too loudly at that and said, ""Silly silly girl"" to me and then instructed the hostess to seat us at our table... which was under a reservation I guess? But maybe a different name? I do not know what's going on and I am so confused and in the light of the next day - I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND.

He told me not to dress up, but he's dressed up? He told me the name the reservation was under and yet he was there the entire time watching from the bar like some creeper and laughed at me when we first met. I wanted to cry. Not because he didn't look like his photo but because I felt tricked, lied to, and made a mockery of.

I wanted to leave but I walked towards the table that was reserved for us instead. The hostess actually pulled out my chair and made eye contact with me and said, ""Let me know if you need anything from me,"" and left. 

He sat there beaming with a smile. He's better looking when he smiles. If he had sent me a real photo of him like that I would still be sitting here. If he didn't lie about his weight I'd still be sitting here with him. He could've said, Hey I WANT to get in shape but i'm not right now... do you have any recommendations for a gym I can start at?"" I'd have LOVED to meet out with him. This man has no interest in working out and the first thing he said to me after the hostess left was, ""Do you really work out every day?"" and I said, ""Of course I do."" and he asked if I really run every morning at 5 am. I said, No, I get up every morning at 5 am and then I go for a run. It's not at 5 am that I am running. He scoffs at that and I ask if he thinks i'm lying. He says that everyone lies on their dating profile. 

I remind him that we had no dating profile, that he sent me an old photo to my phone number directly. He gives me a smug look and repeats that I'd never give him a chance otherwise. This angers me.

I tell him that I have to work out every day for my mental health and he proceeds to body shame me saying I could use a ""Sandwich"" and I could use more meat on my bones and that I could and should skip working out. He says that a woman should be curvy and soft. And he quotes another movie line, I'm sorry!! I don't know which movie this is from so I don't even flipp'n know what he said. I just sat there like -huh? and he casually says, ""it's from so and so movie"" and I say, ""Don't know it"" coldly. And the waiter comes over to get our drink order and asks my date if he wants what he had at the bar as his tab was still open so he just said he'd covert it over to our table. It's a whisky coke and yes he'll have another. I said I'll have water with lemon and the waiter leaves. And my date starts in with my water and lemon order... criticizing me by saying this, ""Oh so you don't drink?"" I then pull out my phone and scroll up to the message I sent him saying I DON'T DRINK. He laughs and waives my phone away... 

I say, 'Ive been sober since August"" and then this mfer has the audacity to proclaim I have a drinking problem, that I'm a drunk, that I might be this that and everything else. I cut him off and said that I drink maybe a handful of times a year for special occasions but I no longer drink at all because it was a choice I made to be sober. He presses me more accusing me of being a closeted drunk and I admit that I'm off all drugs because I used to be an every day smoker (weed) and that I quit that, too and part of my healthy lifestyle and mind set I got into therapy and quit everything except caffeine. He is clearly upset I won't get a drink so when the waiter comes back he orders a drink for me. I tell the waiter - no thank you and he orders it anyway and I decide to let it go. If he wants to pay for a drink he can. 

I say, ""I thought you said you were going to sweep me off my feet?"" and his cheeks light up red like a neon sign. GOOD. I'm happy. I'm, on purpose, casually squeezing my lemon into my water and I stir it and drink it and set it back down before I give him my attention. I continue, ""I thought you were going to sweep me off my feet yet all you've done so far is lie to me and get upset that I don't know your movie lines and you told me not to dress up but show up in a suit and tie,""

That's when he starts laughing and then makes fun of what I am wearing. Again I'm in a nice sweater, jeans and boots with a small heel on them. Looking around, I am not the only one dressed like this btw. more than a dozen other women are dressed like I am. I can only see 1 other woman in a long dress and another in slacks. Everyone else is wearing JEANS. He's literally the ONLY Person in a suit and tie. 

I am now looking at the menu while he's quoting movie lines I don't know and now he's doing it like this - rapid fire ""Do you know this one?"" and giving me a movie quote and I shake my head to say No and he then says how about this one? and gives me a quote and I say no. 

I decide what I'm going to order and when the waiter comes back my Date spent no time looking over the menu and I order leaving him zero time to decide so he orders the special - which was a pasta dish. The waiter leaves and I decide to buckle in for the ride and I start to ask him questions reffering to my phone the entire time going over each lie he told me and asking him to explain himself. 

For over a month (that's the time he had my phone number) he's lied about nearly everything about him except his age and his job. He thinks I'm being snobby because of his job but he doesn't know that I'm saving up to buy a house and I have my writing job (my bread and butter) and I work a full time job that is a service job and a part time retail job on the weekends. He doesn't know this yet so he thinks I'm upset that he doesn't have more money or a better job and is going off on me. 

Little did I know that our food was going to take over an hour and a half to come out... I had been to this place a million times before and the only reason I was taking my time with the menu is because they added more gluten free items and I wasn't sure if I wanted to try it out - I didn't try anything new I ordered what I always order and it literally never takes that long to make or come out. Neither did his simple pasts dish special he ordered and the place wasn't more busy than they usually are on a Sat. night so I was just counting the minutes until our food came. 

We did find our stride in our conversation, though, when we started talking about his job and I listened and asked questions about it. I, on the other hand, was not afforded the same respect. If I tried to bring up my job or what I did he would say, ""Whoa whoa whoa it's not all about you,"" and call me, ""Silly girl"" several times. He also kept saying each time he said something mean or overly critical that he's ""Just joking"" and even at one point said, ""I don't know how this is going to work out if you can't take a joke,"" and that's after about 45 solid minutes of talking about his job. Which, he's a welder. My grandpa was a welder so I'm not about to think that's a bad job or a low brow job... I'm fine with him being a welder. And I know what sort of questions to ask because I had a closer friend who used to make signs and so I was happy talking shop with him about welding. He was also in construction but apparently he had a work injury and that's when he switched it up to just do welding. Nothing about that was a problem for me. I work a weekend retail job where I help ladies find the right hair extensions lol and nail polish - my life is not that serious. Of course he never found that out because I wasn't allowed to talk about it. 

Waiter came back to apologize about our food not coming out on time. There were people by this time who had been seated after us, ordered, and were finishing up their meals!! I never had this sort of poor service here at this place so I was bewildered why this had to happened and happen on the night I had an insufferable date.

And my date kept brining up the fact that I was so underdressed. And I finally snapped and told him that he's a literal jerk for not only insisting several times I don't dress up but then to criticize me for not dressing up!! A jerk for sitting at the bar and watching me, a jerk for shaming me for not knowing his movie quotes, which he was still doing btw. And a jerk for lying about what he looked like and then shaming me saying I'd never give him a chance. He looked genuinely hurt by that but I didn't care. I went on to tell the waiter when he came back with more bread (bread I cannot eat so I'm starving) and tell us it will be another 20 minutes on our food - I give him my card and tell him to put the food on my card, and to box my food up. I'm leaving. I'm out of here. I'm not staying a minute longer but I'm also not leaving without my food. PERIOD.

My date is completely shocked. He excuses himself to use the restroom and while I am sitting there looking like I'm upset the waiter and the hostess and anyone else who had interacted with me last night gave me looks like they felt sorry for me. I figure now looking back on it that something was up - i just don't know what. While my date is gone, I was hoping he left, I grab my phone and look up one of my favorite movie quotes from Daniel Day from There will Be Blood and I play it a few times so I can get the inflection right lol I already know I'm going to say that, take my food that I paid for and jet. 

My date comes back to the table and announces rather loudly, enough for the tables around us to hear, that he's had a word with the chef (HAHAHA OKAY BET?!) about our meal and that it should come out as soon as possible. The waiter comes back with my card that I gave him and gives it back to me with another water with lemons in a bowl this time. And says to both of us he's very sorry our meal is taking longer to come out and assures us it will be soon. 

From the time I got there - it was just after 6 pm (reservations, I was told, were at 6) and from the time I left it was just hitting 8:45 - and I stayed and ate my entire meal with him. I forgot I was going to do the I drink your milkshake line btw because the food was AMAZING!!

I don't usually eat cheese because it causes me inflammation but I had ended up ordering food that had a bit of cheese in it and because of that I sort of said, eff it, imma get an espresso. I was happy with my meal, my date, on his end, was not. 

He complained twice about his pasta not being what he thought - it was a meatless bowl of pasta lol so they had to bring him another menu where he ordered some chicken that looked great! But the seasoning had gluten in it so I could not have any when he offered me a bite. He acted like I was being nit picky and when he tried to put a chuck on chicken on my plate, I quickly picked up my plate and moved it making it so the hot chicken fell onto the area my plate had been in. This guy clearly doesn't know that No Thank you was me being kind. I set my plate down to the side, grabbed a knife I had not used yet, and flicked the chicken (a la food fight) at him in disgust and said to keep GLUTEN off my plate. I was not playing around. The last time I had cross contamination I ended up in the hospital with an IV in my arm for 3 days because I have celiacs disease and could not stop shooting out from both ends like that goat from futurama LOL Mr. Chunks (sorry bad visual but that's how serious it gets and I have too many jobs to be at and a kid to take care of lol so Mama can't be sick!) I honestly thought he'd fake laugh because that's what he had already been doing the entire night deflecting every reasonable action or thing I said - this was the action that made him look at me and say, ""You are do disrespectful,"" and it was my turn to fake laugh only it wasn't fake. I laughed a bit too loud and then I started laughing at the fact that I laughed too loud and well... now I look like an insane crazy person to everyone around us. I give no cares to this fact though and I laugh harder thinking about how ppl will think I'm the one that's unhinged. Maybe I am? Maybe I eff'n am at this point. 

Waiter came back to check on us and I wasn't done yet so I'm telling him everything is great. I had a salad, a gluten free pasta dish that came with my own gluten free chicken lol and I was about halfway done with it and I honestly think my date is drunk now because he's been ordering whisky cokes the entire time. Like nearly each time we were being checked on this guy ordered another drink. I ask if they have coffee and he says yes and I just casually say, I think I'll have an espresso after my meal. Because I think I already paid for everything, I grab my card, the waiter hold up his hand to let me know it's already being taken care of and I say, But I'm ordering more. It was a strange interaction and since I was already super moody, I force the waiter to take my card and say, ""Please put an espresso on my card,"" and he finally takes it lol I'm like - what the hey is going on. 

That's when my date tells me he made it so everything would be put on his card. That my insistence to pay and leave earlier was switched by him. Remember I wanted to leave and get my meal in a to go box? Yea well he got up and apparently told them NOT to do that and I'm not sure but I'm pretty sure now when I think about it - he probably told them to take longer bringing out the food. I mean... I don't know, I can't be sure, but it was weird it took SO LONG. The waiter came back with my card and a receipt so I know he at least charged me for an espresso LOL 

We spend the next 15 mins or so going back and forth about paying for the food - because he was using that to call me ungrateful and disrespectful and silly girl. He even said that he was surprised by my audacity to treat him this way because he was taking pity on me and giving me a chance to go out on a date and get a decent meal since I clearly can't get a date. 

I had to set him right because it was a choice to be celibate and single... like a choice to be sober. That I had broken it off with my last boyfriend and that I just didn't want to date right now and I was concentrating on 1. getting into shape and living a healthy sober lifestyle, 2. working and making money to afford land and property 3. focusing on my daughter and all the things SHE wants to do because she's had to go without for a long time and that she wanted to start her own company and I was really 100% investing and working on that on top of everything else I was already doing... 

So fast forward to our espressos coming out - they boxed up what little food I left over because I chowed down!! I had like 4 bites left and told them a box was not necessary LOL but the waiter boxed it up anyway, which was nice. Breakfast for the next day lol and brought our our espressos. 

While drinking it I asked him when the last date he had been on and he admitted it had been several years. Vs my several months so that sort of pissed me off. I was done done. I was like - okay, I got my food, and my espresso and I have some go go juice in me for the hour and half long drive back home so there are new people surrounding us at this point - nearly everyone that was here prior had their food, paid their bill and left x2. So No one sitting close to us witnessed any kind of weirdness prior so when I had had enough I stood up, reached over to his espresso (he made fun of me for ordering one and yet ordered one, too? WTF?! LOL) and I said, ""You probably needed this more than me because you drank so much,"" Grabbed his drink and I drank the last hot gulp he had left. Set it down in the middle of the table, grabbed my food, and yelled out too damn loudly at him ""I DRINK YOUR MILKSHAKE"" and just left. The table closest to us laughed. The waiter looked like he was about to bust a gut but didn't and I didn't see the same hostess I saw a new one so I just jetted out of there.

I pulled over to a gas station to grab a monster energy and typed out a few lines in my notes app that basically just ranted on how this guy was a liar and a loser and I blocked him across all my social media and my phone. Additionally, in my notes app I had said there kept being waives of a stench that was coming my way that I'm pretty positive now was him farting because what else could it have been? I dunno...

So am I the asshole for drinking his espresso and yelling ""I drink your milkshake"" at my date after he kept shaming me all night for not knowing HIS obscure movie quote lines? i did it mostly because I recall the movie and that particular quote was always obnoxiously hilarious to me... I also added that ""I am not the droid you are looking for,"" and just left LOL I hadn't planned to drink his espresso btw I just decided to go full in on that because he already called me disrespectful so I decided to be disrespectful. Also eff that guy. 100%. 

Additional info just in case... I do feel a bit bad in retrospect btw... like last night I was on a high after pulling that but now I do feel guilty... I was diagnosed with C-PTSD after leaving a 10 year relationship with a narcissist and I spent 4 years in therapy and single so I could work on myself and not project all that baggage onto anyone else. I know I'm not perfect. I am rude and abrupt and I understand I come off cold and harsh. I am working on that... I just wanted to add that this man was morbidly obese after telling me he was a lot fitter from the photo he sent me. In the photo he was not that large AT ALL so I expect to see an athletic man who was ""trim"" like he told me he was... I feel like people will criticize me for being put off by this and so I just wanted to say that while yes I do need to still work on myself... I don't feel like I should be made to feel bad about his body type when he lied about it. My shock was not that he was a large man... my shock was from me realizing he so blatantly lied about it.  I have dated men who were not fit or trim in the past and this is not a prerequisite for me to date you... just don't lie about it!! Use updated photos as I didn't give him fake photos or use a filter... I literally sent him a photo where I purposely looked like complete crap because if he still wants to date me after seeing me at my worst then ""LET'S GOOOOO!"" but he said he was thinner and more athletic than the old ass photo he sent me... so if I'm a dick for saying what I've said about his size so far, please accept my apology. I'll bring this up in therapy and work on it. I guess I want to concentrate more on being pissy with me for not getting his movie quotes, for shaming me for how I dressed, for making fun of me for being sober... and even for my end where I kept calling him a liar for the factual things he lied about. 

Hand down, worst date of my life!! zero out of 5 stars. Would not date him again. Might not go out on another date for another 9 months... or ever again. I am not the droid you are looking for LOL ",0,1742758095.0,AITAH,8,0.29,False

1ji7ey4,https://i.redd.it/vsjm3b18qhqe1.jpeg,I think that NYC is the meritocratic forge where sovereign minds turn ambition into empires...,"Ayn Rand’s awe for New York’s skyline “I would give the greatest sunset for one sight of New York’s skyline” is not mere admiration for architecture. It is a tribute to the city’s unmatched power to awaken the human spirit to its own potential. The skyline is not just steel and glass, it is a psychological mirror, reflecting back the raw truth, greatness is not bestowed, it's seized. Here, in the relentless hum of ambition, you're confronted with a choice ascend or vanish. When you stand beneath Manhattan’s towers, you aren't dwarfed, you're challenged. The Empire State Building, born from defiance of gravity and doubt. Wall Street, a temple to the alchemy of capital and reason. Broadway, where relentless hustle turns art into empire. These are not monuments to oppression, but to the triumph of the individual mind. Each skyscraper began as an idea, an unapologetic declaration of “I will.” What is your declaration? In New York, effort is not a burden, it is currency. The 100hour weeks of Goldman Sachs analysts? Apprenticeships for mastery. The sleepless nights of tech founders in cramped Brooklyn lofts? Forges for unicorns. The artist sketching subway commuters at dawn? A future gallery show in gestation. This city rewards those who trade excuses for action, who understand that value demands creation. Every hour worked, every risk taken, every handshake in a crowded coffee shop compounds into opportunity. The streets whisper: *“Outwork the doubters, or become one.” Critics cry “inequality,” but their tears drown in the subway’s roar. The bodega worker coding python after closing, the Uber driver pitching startups between rides, the immigrant flipping halal cart chicken into a franchise, these are Rand’s heroes. They know scarcity is not a curse, but a catalyst. High rent? A gun to your head demanding innovation. Shared subway cars with CEOs? A masterclass in proximity to power. Poverty here is not a sentence, it is a provocation. New York does not coddle. Fail, and you are replaced by sunrise. Succeed, and your name etches itself into the city’s DNA. Degrees rust. Pedigrees crumble. The only credential that matters here is results. The city’s unwritten code is Rand’s ethos incarnate.“Wealth is the product of man’s capacity to think.” Your net worth is your self-worth, not because the city is cruel, but because it is honest. The secret to conquering New York is not luck, lineage, or legerdemain, it is obsession. The lawyer billing midnight hours, the chef perfecting a $500 tasting menu, the entrepreneur bleeding into a pitch deck, they share one trait they work like their life depends on it. Because it does. Visualise your name in lights. That corner office. That IPO. That Tony Award. Now ask, will you let 8 million others outwork you? You’ve already sacrificed comfort to stand here. Will you waste that sacrifice on halfmeasures?  ",8,1742757976.0,aynrand,1,1.0,False

Did a gentle walk for some fresh air and this is when I  realized it had started working properly, I felt completely relaxed and my rushing thoughts stopped. This was a new experience for me so again caused me to cry. This even, calm feeling only lasted around 20 mins

This is where it goes downhill for me, as after the nice 20 mins I felt high, the only other time I've felt this is whilst on morphine after surgery. This lasted hours, I was completely spaced out, everything seemed fuzzy (again exactly like being on very strong painkillers).
When this started to subside SLIGHTLY I was aware of heart palpitations, the HR hadn't actually gone up but just jumpy. Any time I tried to eat I felt so sick my mouth was salivating, I managed some bread and yoghurt at lunch and plain chips for dinner.
The entire afternoon I felt twitchy and anxious (although I will say anxious in my body and not my head)

I can feel it wearing off now as my mind is actually the most clear it's been all day but honestly aside from the emotional side I would say I was 100000% worse on elvanse 

All I keep reading is to stick it out but I'm really not sure I can, I definitely couldn't drive like this, look after my children like this - it seems insane

Has anyone had quite intense side effects like this before and how was it if/when they settled??

I'm exhausted but minds starting to race again so will see how sleep goes

I started a keto diet in early September and am down 70lbs from 319. I'd like to touch the 220lbs and then settle into a good maintenance weight. I started walking/jogging 5ks on a treadmill multiple times a week in November, mixed in swimming and spin classes starting in December, and started the 5x5 protocol in January.  
I've spent time in the weight room at different points in my life, but had never leaned into barbell work - mostly cable machines and some dumbbell work. Strength training has been awesome, and I'm getting results.  
Probably more context than needed for my question: I have been resting for 2 weeks because I had developed what I've self-diagnosed to be tendonitis in my left forearm. General soreness from my lower elbow to wrist, pain that worsens with activity, pain when gripping. I got the impression that it was getting worse with each lift so I leaned into resting it and haven't lifted for two weeks.   
Things are on the mend, and I recently did a swim workout where I noticed some pain, but afterwards I feel close to 100%. I've also started using a grip trainer and theraband flex bar do some focused work on my grip strength. But really not intensive work for the last two weeks.   
I think my forearm trouble stemmed from the bicep curl. When I was young I fractured my left wrist and have always felt it's been a little weaker than my right arm. I think that the barbell curl rotates that left arm just a bit into an uncomfortable position, at least this exercise is the one where I feel some amount of pain similar in the areas that have been sore. I'm also suspect of the tricep extension and possible bent over row.   
I'm about to get back at it, abd I'm planning on just starting all my lifts at a reduction of 10% weight from where I was last. I think I'm going to replace the barbell tricep and bicep lifts with dumbbells. And, specifically for the bicep exercise switch to hammer curls with palms facing inwards.   
Posting to ask if anyone has thoughts or perspective on this plan, or other ideas for how I might approach returning to the 5x5 program. Also really curious if anyone has experience with tendonitis and how to balance ""no pain, no gain"" with when it's time to rest.

⸻

# 🇪🇺 If Europe was a group of friends… 🎭🍷

🇫🇷 France – The loud one. Always ready to argue, especially if it’s about food, culture, or politics. Will protest just to stay in shape. Drinks wine while arguing about politics and thinks everyone secretly wants to be French. Loves to flirt but gets mad if you flirt back. 

🇩🇪 Germany – The responsible overachiever. Builds everything, fixes everything, balances everyone’s budget, and secretly judges France’s chaotic ways. Efficient, logical, but can party hard at the right time. Pretends not to care about drama but knows every detail. 

🇬🇧 UK – The sulky rebellious ex who still shows up at family events / the grumpy, dysfunctional family. England leads the drama, complaining about rules but following them anyway. Scotland side-eyes, dreams of independence, and quietly thrives. Wales is poetic, underrated, and chill—but will fight you over rugby. Northern Ireland is… complicated. All bound together by sarcasm, shared exasperation, while reminding everyone of “the good old days” (mostly England). Drinks tea aggressively. 

🇮🇹 Italy – The chaotic artist. Either incredibly stylish and charming or an absolute disaster, no in-between. Can cook, can love. Talks with their hands, always late, but somehow gets away with everything because… look at them 

🇪🇸 Spain – The party animal who lives between siesta and revolution. Can go from a peaceful nap to a full-blown protest in 0.2 seconds. Loud, passionate, and always up for tapas. Loves football, flamenco, and arguing about which region has the best food. Historically dramatic, politically messy, but somehow still running on sunshine and good wine. Has centuries of history but still insists it’s young at heart. Will invite you in like family, then roast you like one too.

🇮🇪 Ireland – The fun but rebellious friend. Loves a good fight (especially with the UK), drinks like a champion, tells the best stories, and somehow makes suffering sound poetic. Loves music, and myths. Can drink you under the table and then recite poetry about it. Still not over 800 years of British rule but sings about it beautifully. Sheep. 

🇳🇱 Netherlands – The chill but secretly savage one. Acts relaxed, but will destroy you in a debate. Bikes everywhere, judges your life choices while smoking a joint, and somehow manages to be both laid-back and incredibly successful. 

🇸🇪 Sweden – The effortlessly cool and emotionally reserved friend. Designs beautiful things, pretends to have no emotions, but is secretly stressed 24/7. Drinks coffee like it’s a survival tool. Good thrillers. Viking. 

🇩🇰 Denmark – The effortlessly successful one. Happy, rich, and somehow always ahead of everyone in everything. Pretends to be humble but is secretly flexing all the time. Viking. 

🇳🇴 Norway – The rich but low-key friend. Spends half the year in darkness and still functions better than everyone. Owns more oil than they let on. Loves nature more than people. Viking. 

🇫🇮 Finland – The quiet one who will absolutely destroy you if needed. Loves the cold, the sauna, and being left alone. Might not talk much, but when they do, it’s either pure wisdom or pure savagery. 

🇧🇪 Belgium – The middle child with an identity crisis. Speaks multiple languages, but never knows which one to use. Loves beer, fries, and waffles more than life itself. Constantly overshadowed by France and Germany. Also, chocolate.

🇵🇱 Poland – The tough survivor. Has seen too much, been through too much. Trusts no one, and is always ready to fight if necessary. But will also feed you the best homemade food and tell you stories about how their grandma lived through everything. 

🇵🇹 Portugal — The melancholic dreamer. Lives for music, good wine, and deep conversations about fate. Pretends to be humble but secretly knows they were once the first global empire. Rolls their eyes every time someone says Spain and Portugal are the same. Will feed you ridiculously well. 

🇦🇹 Austria – The elegant yet secretly wild one. Acts classy, loves classical music, but will outdrink you in a ski resort. Thinks everyone should appreciate art more. Judges Germany for being too serious but follows their lead anyway. 

🇨🇭 Switzerland – The high-maintenance diva. Pretends to be neutral while watching everything. Rich, a bit mysterious, will lend you money with interest, and will always, always get the best deal. Also, chocolate. 

🇬🇷 Greece – The ancient philosopher turned chaotic uncle. Invented democracy, now yells about how everyone else is ruining it. Simultaneously broke and convinced they invented civilization (which… they kinda did). Can party and lecture you at the same time, probably while smashing plates. 

🇨🇿 Czech Republic – The beer-fueled philosopher. Pretends to be cynical but secretly cares. Loves deep debates over a pint, trusts beer more than politicians, and has perfected the art of not taking life too seriously. Will absolutely destroy you in sarcasm, then take you to the best underground bar you’ve ever seen. 

🇭🇺 Hungary – The dramatic nationalist who thinks they should still have an empire. Loves history but selectively. Fiercely independent, even when it’s inconvenient. Complains about the EU but won’t leave. Deep down, just wants to be taken seriously—preferably while eating paprika-loaded food and reminding you they have the best thermal baths. 

🇷🇴 Romania – The mysterious friend with a hidden depth. Will tell you Dracula stories while casually hacking into a system and sipping țuică. Loves folklore, dark humor, and proving people wrong. Friendly but won’t trust you right away. Might curse you in a poetic way if you cross them. 

🇧🇬 Bulgaria – The underrated gem. Quietly impressive, full of history, but tired of being confused with other Balkan countries. Nods for ‘no’ and shakes head for ‘yes’ just to mess with you. Has great beaches but won’t tell you about them. 

🇸🇰 Slovakia – The underrated adventurer. Loves the mountains more than people, disappears into nature every weekend, and secretly thinks their cuisine is superior. Drinks stronger liquor than you and will out-hike you without breaking a sweat. Small but fierce, will fight you if you mix them up with their neighbor. 

🇸🇮 Slovenia – The friend who has their life together. Beautiful, peaceful, loves nature, and somehow managed to avoid most European drama. Basically the ‘I moved to the countryside and found peace’ friend. 

🇷🇸 Serbia – The Balkan tough guy. Proud, stubborn, and ready to argue about history for hours. Loves a good ćevapi and rakija session, but don’t get them started on politics unless you’re ready for a debate that lasts all night.

🇭🇷 Croatia – The effortlessly cool one. Has stunning beaches, amazing food, and a strong personality. Low-key flexes their coastline every summer while pretending they don’t care. Secretly thinks they’re the real heart of the Balkans. 

🇧🇦 Bosnia & Herzegovina – The survivor with a heart of gold. Has been through way too much, but still keeps going. Drinks coffee like a ritual, will feed you endlessly, and somehow makes you feel like family within minutes. 

🇲🇪 Montenegro – The stylish but unpredictable one. A small country with big energy. Beautiful, dramatic, and never in a rush—except when driving like a maniac on a mountain road. 

🇲🇰 North Macedonia – The underrated intellectual. Passionate about history, but constantly annoyed that people don’t know which Macedonia they’re talking about. Low-key loves a good identity crisis. 

🇽🇰 Kosovo – The determined underdog. Young, energetic, and always ready to prove themselves. Fiercely independent, loves their traditions, and will never turn down a party. 

🇦🇱 Albania – The wild card of the Balkans. Mysterious to outsiders but deeply loyal to those who understand. Can go from medieval mountain village to high-tech urban jungle in a heartbeat. 

🇪🇪 Estonia – The tech genius. Runs on WiFi and efficiency. Casually five years ahead of everyone in digital life, probably already working on an AI government. Prefers forests over people. Has the best electronic systems in Europe but won’t brag—just gives you a smug look when your country still uses paper for taxes. 

🇱🇻 Latvia – The quiet, artistic one. Loves music, nature, and avoiding conflict. Doesn’t trust people easily, but once they do, they’re fiercely loyal. Has spent centuries fighting off invaders and somehow still standing strong. Drinks like a warrior when the occasion calls for it. 

🇱🇹 Lithuania – The phoenix. Has been through it all and came back stronger. Tough, proud, and always ready to remind you that they existed before you even knew where they were on the map. 

🇨🇾 Cyprus – The friend with relationship drama. Technically one island, but in a complicated situation. Loves the beach, great at hospitality, but will never stop reminding you about their history. 

🇲🇹 Malta – The Mediterranean wildcard. Small but fierce. Lives on the beach, has more history than most, and somehow manages to stay out of trouble. Knows everyone’s secrets but won’t spill—unless there’s wine involved. Balances being a laid-back islander with having a past full of knights and battles. 

🇱🇺 Luxembourg – The ridiculously rich but low-profile one. Owns half of Europe’s banking system but acts like it’s no big deal. Will help you out… for a price. 

🇱🇮 Liechtenstein – The ultra-private rich kid. So small you forget they’re there, but they’re doing just fine without you. Has more money than they let on, no drama, and probably owns something important in your country without you even realizing it. 

🇻🇦 Vatican City – The ancient grandpa who’s seen it all. Tiny but powerful, always watching, always judging. Technically has its own army but prefers to let higher powers handle things. 

🇲🇨 Monaco – The trust-fund baby. Lives in luxury, surrounded by fast cars and yachts. Doesn’t know what taxes are. Smiles politely while secretly judging everyone else’s financial situation.

🇸🇲 San Marino – The ancient but unbothered grandpa. One of the oldest republics in the world, but stays out of everyone’s drama. Watches Italy’s chaos from the sidelines while casually hoarding wealth and history. judging everyone else’s financial situation. 

🇦🇩 Andorra – The tiny friend who somehow has the best ski resorts. Lives tax-free, speaks multiple languages, and quietly enjoys the perks of being ignored by big countries. France and Spain act like parents, but Andorra just does its thing. 

🇮🇸 Iceland – The mystical loner. Lives in a land of fire and ice, believes in elves just in case, and somehow manages to be both peaceful and absolutely metal. Produces more musicians than people. Could survive an apocalypse without noticing. 

🇬🇱 Greenland – The one who left the group chat. Technically still part of Denmark but doing its own thing. Lives in an icy wilderness, sees climate change up close, and wonders why the world suddenly cares about Arctic geopolitics. 

🇫🇴 Faroe Islands – The Nordic outsider. Technically Danish, but not really. Isolated yet connected. Lives for the sea, the storms, and the sheep. Too small for most people to care, but fiercely proud of its identity.

🇷🇺 Russia – The jealous ex who won’t stop drunk-texting at 3 AM.  
Once the empire everyone feared, now stuck in a mid-life crisis, desperately trying to relive past glories through brute force. For decades, some have dreamed of change, but… bullies, propaganda, fear, mysterious deaths. Projects its deepest insecurities onto the world—especially Europe. Blames anyone daring to exist differently and have fun without them. Allergic to introspection, Kompromat-paranoid, control freak, stalker. Still thinks toxic masculinity is a flex. Needs therapy. Not invited to the party until it stops crashing it with a tank.

🇧🇾 Belarus – The one who can’t leave the toxic relationship. Technically independent, but still stuck under Russia’s shadow. Secretly dreams of breaking free, but for now, plays along. Knows more about surviving under pressure than anyone should. 

🇲🇩 Moldova – The forgotten middle child. Stuck between the EU and Russia’s influence, trying to exist while everyone fights over them. Loves wine, traditions, and pretending things are fine. Would like to be left alone, but geopolitics says no. 

🇹🇷 Turkey – The unpredictable mercurial diva / The bridge between worlds. Too European for Asia, too Asian for Europe—forever balancing between the two. Facebook relationship status: ""It's complicated""—with whom? Honestly, take your pick. Loves tea more than life, thrives on history, and will feed you until you physically can’t eat more. Can be warm and welcoming but also extremely opinionated. Will passionately argue about food, football, and geopolitics in the same breath. Knows their worth and won’t let you forget that they were once an empire.

🇬🇪 Georgia – The fiery soul at the crossroads. Ancient, proud, and stubborn. Loves wine, poetry, and mountains. Too European for Asia, too Asian for Europe—balanced between East and West, but definitely not Russia. Has fought for its freedom too many times to count and will do it again. Just wants to be left alone but always caught in the middle. Never backs down from a fight—whether it’s against invaders, for democracy, or the last khinkali on the table. 

🇺🇦 Ukraine – The defending warrior. Protects all of the above, except one, while fighting for its land, its people, for everyone who believes in freedom. Shouldn’t have to do this alone, but does it anyway. The reason why many of us still sleep in peace. We owe them more than we admit. 

📌 The transatlantic bonus requested by the distant cousins on Threads:  
🇨🇦 Canada – The new recruit in the group / the polite but secretly chaotic cousin from across the pond. Used to hang out with the US, but lately… it’s complicated. Lives in a winter wonderland half the year, has free healthcare, and pretends to be chill. Throwing shade at their old bestie while cozying up to Europe. Secretly loves the drama.

📌 Requested edit by distant cousin on the other side of the family on Threads:  
🇦🇺 Australia – The wild card from down under. Lives surrounded by creatures that can kill you but somehow remains the most laid-back. Calls everyone 'mate,' loves a good BBQ, and will fight you over who has the best beaches. Was supposed to be a penal colony, turned out pretty great and attractive instead: joke's on the Crown. Pretends to be chill but gets VERY loud about sports, especially when beating England.

📌 Requested edit by yet another distant cousin from the other side:  
🇳🇿 New Zealand (Aotearoa, for those in the know) – The chill but secretly badass cousin.  
Lives at the end of the world, surrounded by epic landscapes, unhinged birds, and absolutely no snakes. Seems peaceful, but don’t be fooled—will out-hike, out-sail, and out-rugby you without breaking a sweat. A paradise, yet somehow still complains about Australia stealing the spotlight. Friendly but fiercely independent. Basically the Shire.",1,1742757212.0,u_mmaowww,0,1.0,False

Male, Korean origin but full dutch upbringing (adopted). 181cm long so not that long but okay enough for modelling.

I’m super excited but also scared. I’ll be going for 3 months. Does anybody have experiences in seoul?

1. How does a typical day look like for you?
2. What was your experience with guarantees/contracts?
3. What are workdays like?
4. Does anybody know Korean beauty standards for Koreans?
5. What is something you wish you brought back from Europe that they lack in? One thing I definitely will bring is a french press and coffee lol. I don’t want iced coffees!

But he grew up in a family where he had to compete for attention between his six other siblings, had a neglectful/abusive/addict dad, and a very unstable childhood. He has literally confessed he is codependent and afraid of being alone. 

He also has very clear traits of what seems to be OCD (hypochondria, obsessive thinking, rumination, telling the same stories over and over, body dysmorphia, restrictive dieting, telling me every single little detail of what he's thinking, etc.) However, it could be that he is officially diagnosed with ADHD but has told me he refuses medication and any treatment for ADHD because he 'doesn't want to change his personality.' 

Before we moved in together, this didn't seem as cumbersome, because I was only sleeping over with him two or maybe three nights a week. We talked, we argued, we worked through things. It seemed liked living together would be very smooth, and so far, it has been! Except for the fact that I am feeling almost endlessly mentally drained, over stimulated, and feel like retreating into the middle of the woods and not returning for a few weeks.

Here is a sample day:

I wake up, open my eyes, and he immediately begins talking to me. 'I'm gonna get up, have coffee, put the clothes dryer on for ten more minutes to take the wrinkles out of the clothes, fold my clothes, put them away, then I'm gonna go to the grocery store and probably pick up things for dinner. I was thinking about making cheese steaks but do you care if it's presliced or do you want me to slice it? I was just thinking that that if I slice it myself, I'll have to choose the steak, clean it, slice it, clean up at after it, dun dun dun dun dun.' (He makes the actual sounds with his mouth.) At this point, I remind him that I've asked he not inundate me with long lists of menial details when I wake up. I am very easily overly stimulated and the rest I just woke up from is immediately not just gone, but already getting depleted. 

If I don't close the door to pee, he talks to me while I pee. He used to like to take every shower together every morning and while I enjoyed it for a while, sometimes I just want to be alone. I also had to ask him to please stop standing in the open bathroom doorway when I'm trying to go in there to pee and not talk to me the entire time I'm on the toilet. 

He will then sometimes follow me from room to room. This morning we got bagels and I said I just need some time to rest my mind, play a few rounds of an online game, etc. After a bit, he comes into the computer room, stands in the corner, and eats his bagel while standing up and glancing at me. It's important to note I was raised in a household with an extremely overbearing and verbally abusive stepfather, and having someone just staring at me from the corner sends my fight or flight into overdrive. I take off my headphones and ask if he's okay. He says, 'Yup!' I ask why he's standing in the corner. He says, 'Well we got bagels, so it felt weird if I'd like... go sit alone and eat them, you know?' I actually don't know what that means, so I ask, 'Do you want me to eat with you?' 'Nope! It's okay, you can do your thing!' I try to ignore him standing alone in the corner, glancing at me, while he eats a bagel. I can feel the tension spreading through my body to the point I have to stop eating and I start zoning out while gaming and I know I'm losing the round but I can't get out of the mindset of being watched. Eventually I stop and ask, 'Are you sure you're okay? I can eat with you.' 'Nah, do your thing! I just didn't want to eat alone.' At this point, I am feeling those hot all-over-body prickles and let him finish eating his bagel until he walks away and the tension slowly starts leaving me. 

After this, a few minutes later, he begins telling me every detail of his plans for the day. I mean EVERY detail. I fall asleep every night so exhausted I can't even do my old routine of watching youtube, reading, watching a documentary, etc. I'm so exhausted because he will talk until I'm passing out. Just sharing every detail. I don't know how to explain it. It's like being info-dumped on. 

Last night I was feeling very depleted mentally and asked for some time. He went upstairs. I hear him singing. I put on my headphones. He comes down later and goes, 'Haha, did you hear me singing up there?' 'Yeah. I sure did.' 'Yup, I do that sometimes!' Okay? In the most loving way possible, can you please shut up sometimes? I can not turn my brain off because I'm hyper aware of the fact that as soon as I relax, he might do something to get attention. 

When I try to cook dinner, if he's there, he is always in the way because he moves around the very small kitchen just chattering. 'Yeah I was gonna go to the gym tonight, but if I do that, then I won't have a rest day, and I think maybe I'll just go tomorrow, and then if I go tomorrow that means I'll have time tonight to clean up a bit downstairs, and then I can go out to the porch and watch my show, and tomorrow I wanna do shoulders and back. (At this point, he will do things like start body-checking in the reflection of the kitchen window.) I've been doing this thing with free weights where I lay on the bench, and then I do like this and this and this (he says the word 'this'), and then I...' 

Reddit, I love him, he's very sweet, but I want to fucking scream. He gets uneasy if I don't greet him 'enough' when he gets home from work. He gets uneasy if I'm not texting enough through the day. He has a routine where he sends me the same exact two gym selfies every single day (new photos, same two poses, same outfit, same gym) and notices when I don't respond to them. He takes little things very hard sometimes. Like if I made a burger for dinner hours before he got home from his shift, he texts to say he is picking himself up a dinner, so I don't tell him I was going to offer him to make him a burger because he just already told me he made his own dinner plans. He takes this as being 'left out'. 

What the hell do I do??? Literally in every other regard he is loving, responsible, etc. I've explained to him that my energy is like a battery and there are times I need silence and to be alone in a room so I can decompress or focus on a creative project. And he will try sometimes. But then he will 'forget' and slip back into it. I am starting to judge myself as being a bitch, cold, mean, etc. Because the way I feel mentally when I just want alone time and he's Solo Bagel Eating in a Time Out Corner of His Own Making makes me think these awful thoughts like, 'I'd love to book a cabin in the middle of the woods for a week and be visited by nobody.' 

  
Haha HELP.

I was treated poorly by my manager often (overworked, unreasonable deadlines, poor communication, dismissive attitude) and a challenging work environment. I left for a position that is a promotion in title, but not in pay, due to it being a non-profit. I decided to give 2 1/2 weeks notice and let my direct manager know in person. 

I was actually surprised by their reaction - they indicated they were disappointed, but also felt I would make a greater impact in my new role and understood why I was leaving. I also met with their boss, the person who originally hired me, and they took me out for coffee and expressed being thankful for all of my contributions. They asked me how it was working with my manager, and I noted that we had different management styles and there were some challenges with communication etc. but didn't complain or bring up anything overly specific or negative. They seemed to understand this and indicated they need to consider this for who they hire next. They won't be hiring for my position right away - so I mentioned that I may be able to do some consulting on the side if they need any extra support (as I have cleared that with my new role). They indicated they may very well take me up on that! I also feel like I could ask for a reference, particularly from my boss' boss, if I needed to. 

Long story short, I don't think it's ever worth burning a bridge when you are leaving an employer. You never know when those connections will come in handy and further support your career. Burning a bridge can only hurt your career.

1ji6twu,https://www.reddit.com/r/cenineri/comments/1ji6twu/the_legacy_vault_clazziquai_project_koreas/,The Legacy Vault🏆 - Clazziquai Project: Korea’s Electronic Fusion Pioneers,"Before the term ""fusion"" became trendy in modern K-pop and Korean R&B, *Clazziquai Project* had already established themselves as sonic trailblazers. Emerging in the early 2000s, the group stood out with their innovative blend of electronic house, bossa nova, acid jazz, ambient, R&B, and even classical elements — all layered into cohesive, genre-bending tracks. Formed by producer and composer DJ Clazzi, with vocalists Alex and Horan completing the trio, *Clazziquai*brought something wholly unconventional yet utterly compelling to the Korean music scene at the time.

Their 2004 debut album, **Instant Pig**, was a refreshing detour from the mainstream pop of its era. It introduced Korean audiences to digital soul: slick synth lines, downtempo beats, and sensual vocals interwoven into tracks like **""Sweety""**, **""Come to Me""**, and **""After Love""**. The group's sound was mellow yet rhythmically intricate, often compared to international acts like Zero 7 and Air, yet rooted in distinctly Korean melodic sensibilities.

Perhaps what made *Clazziquai Project* so culturally significant was their refusal to cater to dominant trends. Instead, they built a cult following through mood-driven atmospheres and soft experimentation. They were among the first Korean acts to be described as both ""club-ready"" and ""coffee shop-ready"" — equally suited for late-night DJ sets and introspective solo listening. This duality allowed them to transcend genre, age, and even national boundaries.

Their success extended beyond Korea as well. *Clazziquai* made early waves in Japan and Canada, releasing English versions of their songs and performing abroad before the idea of the Hallyu Wave had fully taken hold. Their bilingual discography and multicultural influences broadened the image of what Korean artists could be. *Clazziquai* proved that global sound didn’t have to mean Western imitation.

With each release — from **Love Child of the Century** to **Mucho Punk** and **Blessed** — the trio refined their musical identity. Their tracks frequently appeared in dramas, commercials, and indie compilations, further cementing their quiet but lasting influence. The 2005 drama **My Lovely Sam Soon** notably featured their hit **""Be My Love""**, which played a huge role in solidifying the group’s presence in mainstream consciousness while still staying true to their niche.

Despite being largely absent from the typical idol-centric K-pop discourse, *Clazziquai Project* helped lay the groundwork for future experimentalists in Korea’s indie and crossover scenes. Artists like *Heize*, *Crush*, *Dean*, and *Primary* arguably benefited from the groundwork *Clazziquai* laid in normalising genre fluidity and electronica in Korean pop contexts.

Their enduring appeal lies in their commitment to artistry over algorithm. In an industry increasingly built on virality, *Clazziquai Project* reminds us of a time when music was allowed to simmer, unfold, and linger. Their work invites listeners to engage deeply, to sit with complexity rather than chase a hook.

Even today, their influence can be felt in the wave of hybrid genres dominating the Korean soundscape. Whether through the lo-fi textures in modern R&B, the jazz-infused beats in hip-hop, or the resurgence of synth-heavy atmospheres in K-pop B-sides, echoes of *Clazziquai*'s ethos remain.

About me : I like Gaming, Art (Digital Art), listening to music (I listen to a lot so please don’t ask my favorite XD because I don’t even know), frogs, cats, cinnamoroll, kuromi, boba tea-taro is my favorite, anime (haven’t watched in a while), watching YouTube videos, movies, sleeping, coffee.
Games I play: 
* R.E.P.O
* Roblox 
* Marvel Rivals (non competitive)
* Vrchat
* Minecraft (modded only)
* Cult of the lamb
* 7 days to die
* Risk of rain 
And much more, just looking for new games to play with others too >.<
I’m on NA servers, would prefer NA and EU since ping issues on certain games.

Any ideas for places I can post my flyer, or offer my free services to people without it being seen as soliciting? These are my ideas so far:
-Starbucks, local coffee shops, Panera
-Smoke shops (since smoking “bakes” plaque onto teeth their customers may need the type of deeper cleaning I’m looking for)
-People who work at bars or night shifts that might be available in the morning
-Locally owned restaurants since they might allow me to post a flyer
-Libraries
-Churches

Any tips would be greatly appreciated since I’m not familiar with the area. (It was suggested to me by a teacher that I ask Target if I can talk with some of their customers but the idea of chatting people up while they’re trying to shop makes me nervous.) Thank you so much. 🙏

But it has been a year now, and the way she said goodbye still haunts me in my head. I don't understand why I am bothered so much for not receiving at least a phonecall. I never took therapy over this as it seemed so trivial but now Im considering it.

The breakup itself wasn't even harsch, we never had a fight, just long distance and feelings faded from her side. We stayed online friends because there was always a potential to get back together once we we lived close to each other again. The time we spent irl was amazing for both of us.

That was until she found someone else and texted me she thinks too much happened between us to remain friends, I agreed. 

That was the moment I asked to have a final phonecall, a story of some sort, to conclude, for a nice goodbye. She ignored the request.

I must have been an idiot for confronting her with that 3 months later, so like 9 months ago. Initially she wasnt amused, but then gave me an apology that it was not nice of her to not respond, she thought my request for a phonecall was not too much to ask for, but emotionally she couldnt do it. When I asked why, she said something was and still is blocking her, but she doesn't understand why. When I asked how she was doing, she said she felt shitty but didn't want to talk about it, so I left it there.

I think it was very sweet she tried to explain, and I now knew I had to get closure by myself. But there is still this voice in my head saying this girl was done with me and was able to say 'goodbye within 1 text,' just like that, while I was not even worthy of a phonecall. Its an internal fight in my brain, and I just do not understand why it bothers me so much.

I don't even think she would have been a good long term partner for me by how avoidant she is. So why cant I just move on?

With previous women I dated I always ended up drinking a coffee or have some chat on the phone before saying goodbye and then I just moved on...

He didnt find anything but said they have to drain the water. On friday she went in the morning to drain the water. She was in such a bad conditon, he immediately sent her to the ER. They did a CT and found a perforation of her colonal. They told her she needs a stoma, if not she will die very soon from a sepsis. She said she doesnt want to die. We said goodbye and see you soon.
When they opened her belly, they found two massive tumor. Surgeon has never seen something like that before. She never woke up again and on saturday morning we let her go.

A few months later she said a friend would come over for dinner (not saying his name) during the evening. I asked who it was. So she told me it was her ex. This I found a little bit odd and asked why he is coming over. She said they are still friends after the break-up several years ago and sometimes they meet. Their breakup was bad. He left her and some mental health issues she has at the moment are related to this event, but she forgave him. I said it would maybe better to close this chapter and not seem him anymore so she can maybe focus on the future, otherwise it is like he is standing between us (like a ghost). She got all defensive. Saying, I don't decide who her friend are. That to her, friends are important (she has a lot of friends) and she doesn't want to choose between me and him. Her ex also has a current GF.

For the time being I decided her meeting him in public during the day was alright. But somehow I just think this will prevent us looking to the future together?

Intended for people who can't afford/access dedicated fidget toys, or don't want to come out as autistic in public. 

**Visual stims:**

* Mystic quartz: Quartz treated with a surface coating that gives it an iridescent or kaleidoscopic rainbow effect. Because it's based on regular quartz the gems are pretty cheap.

* Fluorite crystals: They look like an aurora or rainbow storm cloud trapped in glass. Very pretty. Colors vary so I recommend buying in person or buying induvial crystals on Ebay so you can pick one that you like.

* Fractal art, optical illusions, MC Escher paintings: Visually stimulating art that you can hang as a regular painting. 

* Dichroic prisms: A dichroic coating is designed to block all but a narrow range of colors. It looks really pretty on a prism. 

* Suncatcher crystals: Trippy kaleidoscope prisms.

* Iridescent film or crystals: Iridescent materials change color depending on the angle of light hitting it. They can be quite pretty.

* UV reactive stuff: You can buy all kinds of items designed to glow under UV light. Combined with some UV LEDs or a blacklight flashlight you can create some trippy effects. Google ""trip cave"" for inspiration. Just don't look directly at a blacklight.

* Aurora lights: Shines a rainbow pattern on the ceiling. 

* Glow in the dark stars: Small dots or stars that can be glued onto the ceiling, creating a sort of night sky in your bedroom. They come in multiple colors.

---

**Auditory stims:**

* Bubble wrap: Satisfying when popped. Can be found for free in packaging or for very cheap at office supply stores.

* Silicone popping toy: Similar to bubble wrap but reusable.

* Rainsticks: A hollow branch filled with beads. Flipping it around causes the beads fall and bounce around, creating a calming rain-like sound.

* Music: If you find yourself listening to music to recover from stressful situations, you're probably using it as a stim and not just as music.

* Other audio: Stimming to digital audio doesn't necessarily have to mean music. It could also be ASMR, sound effects, relaxing soundscapes, video game sounds, etc.

* Mini waterfall: A tiny waterfall to sit on your desk and create a calm water trickling sound.

---

**Olfactory stims:**

* Candles, essential oils, perfumes, scented soaps, bath bombs, body sprays, etc: Easy to find in most supermarkets. Come in a million scents. 

* Coffee beans and tea: Also cheap and easy to find. You can smell the right out of the bag, brewing is optional. Coffee beans don't reset nose blindness by the way, that's a myth.

* Cedar wood chips: Meant for smoking meats. Can be purchased in hardware stores. They smell nice when warmed.

* Vick's vaporub, Carmex, lemon scented alcohol wipes: All three have a simple but strong smell and are cheap at stores.

* Vanilla extract: You probably already own some. Give the alcohol a moment to evaporate before smelling it. Also comes in flavors like peppermint, banana and almond. 

* Laundry detergent: If you find a detergent you like the smell of, your clothes become a stim.

* Real plants: Potted plants, sticks from outside, live moss and live herbs can be had for cheap or even free. 

* Aromatherapy necklaces: These house a small vial of essential oils that get slowly released throughout the day. 

---

**Texture stims:**

* Cloth bags of beads: If you have a cloth/silk dice bag, fill it with smooth items like beads, marbles and dice. Feel them through the fabric. 

* Textured glass: Sometimes I find plates, bottles, or other glass items with interesting textures. Smooth bumps and ridges for example. 

* Faux silk/fur: It can be very soft. If you have a coat or gloves with faux fur you can stroke it in public fairly discreetly. 

* Paint brushes and feathers: Being brushed by soft bristles can be quite pleasurable. If you use real feathers make sure they're clean. 

* Memory foam: *squish squish*. You can buy memory foam animals or just rip a hunk out of an old pillow. 

* Squishmallows: Squishable adorable stuffed animals. 

* Acupressure rings: Spiky rings that can be rolled over the fingers.

* Fabric: Silk, fleece, ribbon, faux fur and microfiber all have interesting textures.

* Putty/slime: Silly putty, slime, putty eraser, nonnewtonian fluid, therapy putty, glue, bread dough, ferrofluid, etc.

---

**Oral stims:**

* Miswak sticks: Dried stem of a plant that's very tough and fibrous. When chewed it frays into bristles that naturally clean your teeth. Some reviews say it has a strong smell.

* Sugarcane sticks (in moderation): Similar to miswak sticks but made of sugar and therefor delicious. This should be a treat instead since it's literally made of sugar.

* Licorice root (in moderation): Licorice root can be purchased from some specialty health stores or for tea. It's like chewing on a very flavorful stick, more waxy and less crumbly than cinnamon. In high doses it can cause high blood pressure, so don't chew on it every day.

* Himalayan hard cheese: Typically given to dogs as a chew toy, but they make versions for humans too. [Adam Ragusea has a recipe here if you want to make your own](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvucazJ0kA).

* Biltong, pemmican, snapstix: All three are extremely tough meat jerky that take a long time to chew through.

* Frozen or dehydrated Twizzlers: When they're dry or cold they get very tough.

* Mastic gum: A tough and chewy gum that is generally marketed as a workout for the jaw.

* Vaping: ***Do not*** use a nicotine vape unless you're already addicted to cigarettes and are trying to quit. Non-nicotine vapes are available and come in a million flavors. There are still some health risks due to inhaling compounds like formaldehyde.

* Teething biscuits: Very dense biscuits meant for helping babies with teething issues. Can be purchased from most stores or made from scratch. Frozen bagels are similar.

---

**Pressure stims:**

* Weighted blankets: Like being laid on by a heavy cloud.

* Massage hook: A ball on a curved hook used to massage your back muscles.

* Massages: Involves spending money and being around people, but nothing beats a good massage.

* Compression socks: A gentle hug for your feet.

I wanted to touch on the small, casual details that were present in the earlier days of the game that were subsequently removed or just disappeared, like the multiple coffee flavors, the use of the interknot for small but funny, unserious side quests, the MC sitting by the bed at the end of each day animation, the extra animation of the characters when you view their skills/sets, and the biggest feature of the game out of all of these that was quietly retired, the TV mode.

The exclusion of these small details made the game more boring and taxing to play, for me atleast (and maybe other casual players) It's still fun, but its not the same

Horror Movies - Horror is life. Especially a lot of the older stuff. Not to say that new stuff can't be good too, though, because it certainly can. Recent obsessions are the Terrifier and Smile series.

Music - I lean heavily towards rock and metal, but I'll listen to almost anything. Angus McSix is my favorite band, it's power metal. I'm always open to new suggestions. Jamming out of a lot of 80's rock lately, as well.

Also a big (American) football fan, if anyone out there would like to talk about that.

I think the very first time I experienced it, it felt like paralysis. It was one night in 2023, and I was sleeping and couldn’t move but I felt still awake. I wasn’t able to look around but I was able to see. I didn’t see anything moving or had a paralysis demon or anything like that but I just remembered being awake but also sleeping. Now it’s happening a lot more frequently, but in a different way. I’ll rest my head to sleep but I’m still able to control my eyelids. My body feels heavy in this state like I’m sleeping. I can control my breathing and how often and frequently I open my eyes. When I open my eyes I feel like I’m slipping into consciousness. But then when I close them I feel like I’m falling. It feeling like, when my eyes begin to close I can’t control my breathing anymore (so I think that’s just me falling asleep) but that feeling is terrifying, so when it happens I internally start panicking. I try to rush to open my eyes and I’m desperately trying to breathe and stay awake. This literally just happened just now and I made a Reddit account to ask about this. I tried googling but I got nothing. What’s happening to me??

I do drink caffeine but not often. Yesterday I had Starbucks coffee with espresso but I’ve had the sleep problems even when I don’t drink caffeinated teas or coffees. Last night I fell asleep at around 3am and I slept fairly well. The night before I was waking up constantly in my sleep up until around 3am, I was stressed about a driving test that I failed by 1 point. 
One thing I have noticed is this sleep problem happens sometimes when I’m with my fiancé, like when we nap in bed together during the day this happens. I think that this happens more when I take naps during the day than at night. But it’s still scary. Like when my eyes are open and I’m more conscious, I’m able to make noise. I can’t speak, I’ve tried and when it doesn’t work it’s scary. It’s like, I’m still sleeping but I’m able to groan and make sounds. And that’s usually what I do. Whenever this happens my bodies natural reaction is to fight it and try and stay awake. Because like I said, when my eyes close, I can’t control my breathing as easily and I get scared. When I do muster up the strength to move and get up, if I break out of it and move to another position and try and sleep it’ll happen again. So when this happens I just try and force myself awake and stay awake because I get too scared to sleep again. Please help, idk what’s wrong!!! ",0,1742755706.0,Advice,0,0.5,False

I don’t know when it happened but I feel like he doesn’t love me anymore. He just doesn’t care about anything. He comes home after work and spends time in his office, anything in terms of household maintenance he just doesn’t do. 

All laundry falls on me, this morning he told me that the laundry hamper is getting full and maybe I should do some. When the kitchen isn’t immaculately clean he tells me I should wash some dishes. He throws socks and dirty clothes and garbage all over the house. He has two dogs that he didn’t properly house train and will not pick up after them when they have had accidents or when they get into the garbage. It all falls on me. When I ask for help he gets mad at me. I work full time and I don’t want to do everything on my own. When I have days off work I spend my time cleaning the house, when he has days off work he does nothing but play video games.

Gifts I get him are thoughtful and take effort, for Valentine’s Day he got me a card and a hoodie. He used to get me flowers, candy and nice things. I don’t remember the last time he got me flowers. I don’t remember the last time he brought me coffee in bed just because he wanted to. 

Things are worse in the bedroom. During Covid we had sex as much as we could. Now I’m lucky if I get it once every three months. The last time we had sex it was okay, if you don’t mind no foreplay and if if you don’t mind if he just gets behind you from start to finish. I’m not ugly, people have asked him before how he even ended up with someone that looks like me. I’m beyond frustrated and heartbroken. ",12,1742755467.0,Marriage,8,0.93,False

This is a dysfunctional family story, be aware. 
IT IS A LONG ONE

So I’m (22 F) , have been with my partner nearly 6months (20 m) , we will call him coffee, ( not using real names ☺️)We are extremely happy and have never been happier with our life due to horrible past relationships. I’m at university and I work full time too so I see my mom on weekends when she isn’t at her “exs” house. Coffee is homeless but is looking at the future to get back on his feet with support from myself , his dad and brother. 

My mom (52f ) has been through rough relationships too and believes she wants the best for me, however she disagrees and judges me for everything I do. Go 22 years ago , my mom unfortunately had a struggle with birthing me and had to have emergency surgery because i became ill while she was pregnant with me (I was premature). 
My mom has always said nasty things about my biological father after they got divorced and tells everyone her side of the story without him getting a chance to say his side.( people quickly judged him straight away without asking for his side ). They have been divorced for about nearly 20 years. This will be a different story. My mom had my oldest sister ( f23) naturally no complications and is the “miracle child”. we will call her Harriet. 
My mom has always tried to make it seemed like I owned her something especially since I was ill as a child and she was “apparently “ the only one that looked after me. Yes she use to and does try to emotional black mail me to this day. She believes and I quote “ well I looked after you all those years while you were ill , the least you can do is …..do this or do that” . She always asking for MONEY that’s right MONEY especially when I get paid!!. For the last two months it has been a struggle as my mom owes me over £2,000.

Now I love my mom I do don’t get me wrong but I am a people pleaser and try my best to be reasonable, but sometimes it gets to the point I can’t handle the arguments. My mom nick picks on my style of clothing ( I like to wear trackers sometimes but sometimes wear goth clothes ) calling me “homeless or a chav”. She always comments on my weight saying that i look “pregnant” and anything of that sort. Now I have struggled for years weight loss as I have PCos, and a lot of medical conditions which means multiple medications. Always saying I look too much “like your bio dad”. Use to bother me but my bio dad and myself have never had a better connection farther and daughter since last year and nothing can break that now not even my mom or sister. 

My mom likes to nick picks who I’m daiting and this has been proven to my relationship with coffee , me and him come over on weekends mainly but sometimes during the week when I have work. At first few weeks of me coffee darting she hasn’t had no issue (this is when he had a roof over his head living with his friends). However all of the sudden few weeks past about 3 weeks , she started nick picking on my partner only when I was there in the room. This didn’t make sense and it would cause arguments between mom and coffee but also myself me coffee. Not only arguing but putting strain on mine and coffee mental health. I loved my mom and partner both , I feel that I’m always being pulled in to directions to this day to the fact I keep falling out with my mom because she picks and picks and picks on everything I’m doing and with my partner is doing. 

Now , what about my sister and her partner ? I’m going to call him (m36) stef. In my whole family side and my bio dad and my step dad ( rip he passed 3 years this November ) Harriet and stef can not do any wrong in their eyes like AT ALL! My sister within this year has lost one job because she lied saying I had PASSED AWAY! And that MY MOM WAS IN HOSPITAL ON HER DEATHBED ( we are both okay and none of this happened). My mom gave her a slap on the wrist and turned the page over. Now I do live with my mom when I am not in my uni dorm room and I go back to her house and she demands me to do all the housework along with my partner too. My sister lives full time at moms and if she forgets to do the dishwasher for example , my mom lets her get away away with it but when it comes to me and my partner she doesn’t and kicks off magerly!, like HELL BROKE LOOSE!
 
Me and my partner have tried to reason with her that we will do the jobs but because she doesn’t do anything and bear in mind my mom is unemployed and “can’t work”. It isn’t fair for us to come over and do the house jobs by ourselves! She did not like this at all and has caused so much arguments and I have been toooooo angry( which doesn’t help my mental health). 

My bio dad has tried to help but it causes the, arguments between them and also my mom keeps bringing up the past between them ll the time they argue! My dad has let go of the past but my mom won’t. She keeps saying that my dad was never there when I was ill and that he was a******. THIS ISNT EVEN TRUE SHE ONLY SAID THIS TO GET SYMPATHY!

This is a struggle I need some advice as I don’t want to loose the best relationship I have ever had but not loose my mom as they arguments is causing me to think should I loose contact with all contact on my mom side and pack up and leave but I don’t want that to be the results as I adore my grandparents. My sister never backs me up because she gets whatever she wants and gets away with anything but that will be a different story.

I've been brewing pour-over coffee for about a year now, and I'm finally planning to buy my first espresso machine soon after moving into my own space.

Since I still enjoy my filter coffee, l'm looking for a grinder that can handle both espresso and filter reasonably well.

After some initial research, l've narrowed it down to two options that fit my needs and budget: 
 1. Sculptor 078S (~799€ where I'm based) 
 2. Lagom Casa (~699€)

From what I've read, both seem to strike a good balance for dual use, though neither is particularly exceptional for just one brewing style.

Has anyone faced a similar decision or used either of these grinders? I'd love to hear about your experiences and any advice you might have on which one could work best for my situation. I am based in Germany if that affects your advice.

Our relationship started pretty fast after we officially started dating. We currently have a baby 3 months old. And we each have a child from different relationships. Our relationship is pretty good we have fights like any couple but we try not to have them. We both came from toxic relationships (mine was extremely toxic ex cheated on me with anything that walked in front of him) so we try to avoid being toxic with one another. For example we don’t curse at each other, we give each other space if we’re mad, don’t raise our voice at each other or call each other mean names etc. I can actually say he’s perfect, he’s hardworking, affectionate and very dedicated to us as a family. He’s never given me a reason to think he’s cheating or doing anything he shouldn’t be doing. I know the password to his phone and all his apps, answers whenever I call him, takes me literally everywhere he goes, I know all his friends, I also manage both our checks and whenever he needs money he just asks for some and lets me know what he uses it for. He really gives me no reason to doubt him. But lately my mind wonders and I get this gut feeling he is cheating. I don’t know if it’s just that I can’t wrap my head around someone being this perfect or my gut wasn’t wrong before and now my gut is trying to tell me something I’m not seeing. 

We had a pretty tense situation a few days ago that I can’t seem to just forget and move on. He called me and asked if I can take a coffee for him to drink at his job (burger joint) because he was feeling tired from staying up late, which I did take. This is pretty normal I might drop
Him off something to drink atleast twice a week and I usually call him and he comes out and gives me a hug and kiss goodbye everything good. But that day I just decided to Go inside and drop it off which I’ve probably done a handful of times instead of calling. His shift had just started when I went in maybe like 10 minutes. Well I go in and I see a few of his coworkers ( it’s about 3 guys and two girls) I go in and they all say hi and I wait for him to come out, but while I’m waiting I hear him laughing and talking to one of the girls in the back, but I can’t see them I can just hear them. Then one of the guys goes to back to look for him and comes back out and says my bad will be right out. and like a second later two of the guys run to the back and tell my bf “hey they’re LOOKING for you” both of them with a concern face. He comes out and gives me a big smile and kisses me and puts his hands out for the coffee. I give it to him and just walk out without saying anything.

(The rest of this is a conversation through text) He texted me like 30 minutes later saying thank you for the coffee and that he loves me. I text back saying who he was talking to and he tells me with one of the girls and that he was preparing some stuff. I start going off why did everyone get so nervous and why he was hiding with the girl in the back. He said the girl was on break and he was making some stuff for the kitchen that he wasn’t hiding, and that there’s cameras everywhere and I got mad and texted okay let me go and get the video footage in a sarcastic tone (which obviously I can’t get) he just says that he loves me and that he would never hurt me and we can talk when he gets home. He comes home and I’m pretending to be asleep and he just stares at me I guess waiting to see if I’m awake proceeds to kiss me and turns around to go to sleep. 

I wake up the next day and he’s already awake and he just looks at me and says “your basically my wife I would never hurt you” I get mad and start going off and he just says he wasn’t doing anything wrong and that they were just talking and that he doesn’t understand why the guys went looking for him like that. Then he says that the way I explain my side of the story sounds so suspicious and that he understands my point of view but that again he was doing nothing wrong and swore up and down. We went back and forth I started crying and he got so upset and got no where. The last thing I said was that I would never step a foot in there ever again that way we can avoid situations like this and he got annoyed and said “I can’t agree with you on that because if I agree I’m basically taking blame for something I’m not doing. think what ever you want I tried talking to you, I tried reassuring you how much I love you, but whatever I say you just ignore. You’re taking things so far and I hate seeing you like this especially since I DID nothing wrong. I’ve never given you a reason to think I’m cheating so think whatever you want” he also said that im just being paranoid from my last relationship. After the argument now I feel like he somehow turned this on me. when I was the one who Walked in on something that made me doubt. 

It’s been a few days and he’s trying to act affectionate towards me and tries to reassure me that nothing happened but my gut keeps telling me there something there. But I have no physical evidence he’s cheating of any kind. Will my relationship be the same?",0,1742754250.0,relationship_advice,2,0.5,False

I've been with my boyfriend for seven months, but issues started in December. He gave more attention to a girl from training, stopped when I mentioned it, but still texts her constantly—even during our dates. He doesn’t ask about my life or support me emotionally, yet expects it from me. He also disliked my university colleagues, never offered to pick me up when I had no car, and avoids meeting my brother. I love him, but I feel like I’m giving more than I’m getting, and despite expressing my needs, nothing has changed.
.......................

We've been in a relationship for seven months—he  M [23] and I'm F [21]. The problems started in December 2024.

It began with a girl from his training group. He kept talking about her, and I got the feeling that he knew more about her than he did about me. It seemed like he paid more attention to her, even though she is supposedly a lesbian. I told him that it bothered me, and he fell silent. After that, he stopped mentioning her, but then I saw Instagram stories of them together. I didn’t say anything, even though it made me feel awful. I must mention that it's hard for the two of us to have pictures. Apparently he doesn't like to be photographed, I feel awkward asking him about the picture, and he doesn't mention it either. 

I'm a student, and he’s not. Once, he told me that my company at university bothered him—specifically, my 21-year-old female colleague and a 30-year-old engaged male colleague. To avoid conflict, I stopped mentioning them and distanced myself from that colleague.

At one point, I had a financial problem—I barely had enough money for a bus ticket. I didn’t tell him about it since we don’t have deep conversations. When I mentioned that my colleague had offered me a ride home but that I had decided to take the bus instead, he told me that was unfair and disrespectful to him. I explained the situation, but he still stuck to his opinion.

In January, an old acquaintance messaged me to tell me what my ex-friend was saying about me. He also mentioned that another mutual friend was involved, but the problem was—I didn’t have a mutual friend with that person. I recorded everything and sent it to my boyfriend, curious to find out who the other person was. Later, we argued about it, and I found out that it was actually his cousin who had been involved in the gossip.

Throughout all this, he just told me to ""let it go,"" but I was emotionally exhausted and angry. People were spreading lies about me, and I wanted to know the full story. I received no support from him. He doesn’t ask me questions about myself, and when I try to talk about my feelings, he responds briefly and quickly changes the subject. I've pointed this out to him multiple times, telling him that I need more from him, but nothing has changed.

When he needs support, I’m always there. But when I need something, I don’t get it. He thinks he gives, but in reality, he doesn’t. In January, I started withdrawing emotionally. I don't know how to act around him anymore—everything I do feels like it's too much.

Then, out of nowhere, he started demanding that I tell him about my day. He made it seem like I have communication issues, but the truth is—I don’t feel free to share things with him because I don’t get that same energy back.

I like him. I love him. But no matter how many times I’ve told him what I need, he still doesn’t give it to me.

Meanwhile, he constantly texts that girl. She tells him all her problems, and from what I can tell, he shares his with her too. On our last date, he was texting her the entire time. I saw that she had sent him more than seven messages at once, and he immediately responded.

I’m not a jealous person, but it bothers me that I don’t get that level of attention from him. It feels like he wants control over me, expects emotional support, but doesn’t offer the same in return.

On top of all that, I always travel to meet him at coffee shops using my own transport. When I didn’t have a car, he never once offered to pick me up. He also avoids meeting my brother, which makes me feel like he isn’t fully invested in my life.

I must mention that I don't drink, I don't smoke, I'm a calm person focused on school and work. ",0,1742754155.0,relationship_advice,3,0.5,False

# Aromatherapy Candles‌ 2025: Top 5 Compared‌ (Best for Sleep, Stress & More!)

Are you feeling overwhelmed by ‍the ‍daily grind? ‍Struggling⁢ to unwind ​after a long ​day? Or perhaps you’re just looking to create a more inviting and calming atmosphere in your home? ⁢You're ​not alone. Many individuals, ⁢notably⁣ women aged 25-55, are actively⁢ seeking natural and⁤ effective ways to manage‌ stress, improve sleep, and enhance their overall⁢ well-being. ⁤And that's where aromatherapy candles come in.

In this ⁣comprehensive guide,we'll delve into the world of aromatherapy candles,exploring their benefits,key ingredients,and what to look for when making a purchase. We'll also⁢ present our top 5 aromatherapy candle‌ recommendations for 2025, focusing on specific needs like sleep, stress relief, and overall relaxation. We understand the need for natural and healthy options,⁣ that is why we've focused on identifying clean burning candles that‍ will‍ fill your space with therapeutic ​scents.

**Why ⁢Aromatherapy Candles? Tapping into ‍the Power of ⁤Scent**

For⁢ centuries, aromatherapy has been ⁢used to promote physical and emotional well-being. The practice leverages the power of essential oils to stimulate the olfactory system,‌ which directly impacts the brain and can influence mood, memory, and even hormone​ production. When you inhale the ‌aroma of an essential oil, it travels through the nasal passages to the​ olfactory bulb, which then sends signals to‍ the limbic system – the part of the brain ⁢responsible for⁤ emotions and memories.

Aromatherapy candles ⁤offer a convenient ⁤and⁣ aesthetically pleasing way⁣ to ⁤experience these benefits. ‍By combining the⁣ gentle glow of a candle with the therapeutic properties of ‌essential oils, you can create a⁤ multi-sensory experience that ⁢promotes ⁣relaxation, reduces stress, and ⁤enhances your overall ⁣sense of well-being. Many people turn to scented candles for relaxation​ and as an easy way to introduce ‌home fragrance⁢ options with wellness benefits.

**Understanding the Key Ingredients: What Makes an Aromatherapy ⁣Candle Effective?**

Not all candles ‍are created equal. When ‍it comes to aromatherapy candles, the quality of the ⁤ingredients is paramount. Here's what to look for:

*   **Essential Oils:** This is the⁤ heart of any aromatherapy⁢ candle. Opt for candles that use‌ pure, undiluted ‌essential oils ⁣rather than synthetic fragrances. Pure ⁤essential oils offer authentic​ therapeutic benefits, while ​synthetic fragrances can sometimes⁢ trigger allergies or sensitivities. ⁢Look for candles that ⁢specify‍ the type and origin of the ‍essential oils used. Common essential oils​ used ⁤in aromatherapy candles include lavender, chamomile, eucalyptus, peppermint, and sandalwood.⁤ Each offers a unique blend of benefits.
*   **Wax:** The type of wax⁤ used in a‌ candle can considerably impact‍ its⁤ burn ⁣quality and environmental ‌impact. Here‍ are some of⁤ the most common options:

  ⁤  *   **Soy wax:** A popular choice for‌ natural candles, ⁣soy wax​ is‍ derived‌ from soybeans. It’s a renewable resource, burns cleanly, and has ⁣a good scent throw ⁢(the ability to release fragrance‌ into the ⁢air). Natural soy ‍candles are a great choice.
  ‍  *​   **Beeswax:** A⁢ natural wax produced by bees, beeswax candles are known ⁤for their ‍clean ‍burn and subtle honey⁤ scent.Beeswax is also believed to purify the air by releasing negative ions.
   ‌ *   **Coconut Wax:** A relatively⁢ new⁣ option, coconut wax is derived ‍from ⁤coconuts. It has an excellent scent throw, burns cleanly, and is a enduring ‍choice.
    *   **Paraffin Wax:** A petroleum-based wax, paraffin is the most common type of wax used in candles due ‍to its affordability. Though,⁣ it doesn’t burn as ‍cleanly as ​natural waxes and may release harmful chemicals into the⁤ air. It is best⁢ to avoid⁣ paraffin wax options and focus on clean burning candles with natural wax options.
*   **Wick:** The ⁢wick plays ⁢a crucial role in how a candle burns. Look for wicks‌ made from​ natural fibers like ‍cotton or wood. Avoid wicks that contain lead ⁢or other heavy metals. Lead wicks are now outlawed in the US, but some older candle stocks or international​ products may still ⁢contain them.

**what to Avoid: Harmful Chemicals‍ in Candles**

Given that ⁤a key audience pain point is⁣ concern about‍ harmful chemicals in ‍products, it's essential to be aware of what to avoid:

*   **Phthalates:** These chemicals are ‌often used in synthetic ⁢fragrances to help them last longer. though, phthalates have been linked to hormonal‌ disruption and​ other⁣ health concerns. Look for candles that are ⁣phthalate free candles.
*   **Parabens:** ‌Similar to phthalates, parabens are used as preservatives in many ‌personal‌ care products, including candles. They have also been linked to hormonal disruption. Choose paraben free⁣ candles whenever possible.
*  ⁢ **Synthetic Fragrances:** As mentioned earlier, synthetic fragrances may contain a variety of chemicals that can trigger allergies or sensitivities.Always​ opt for candles ⁣scented with pure essential oils.

**Choosing the Right Aromatherapy Candle for Your needs**

With so many aromatherapy candles ⁣on‍ the market, it can be overwhelming to⁢ choose the right one for ​your needs. Here’s a breakdown ⁣of some popular essential oils ‌and their benefits:

* ​ ⁣ **Lavender:** Known for its calming and ‍relaxing properties, lavender is ‍a popular ⁣choice ​for stress relief candles​ and candles for sleep. It​ can definitely help reduce anxiety, promote ​relaxation, and improve sleep quality.*   **Chamomile:** Another⁤ calming ‍and⁢ soothing essential oil,‍ chamomile is often used to reduce anxiety and promote‌ relaxation.
*   **Eucalyptus:** This invigorating essential oil ⁤can help clear the sinuses, boost energy, and improve focus.It's a ⁤popular choice for‍ those feeling congested or fatigued.
*   **Peppermint:** similar to eucalyptus, peppermint is an invigorating essential oil that can definitely help boost ⁢energy, improve focus, and‍ relieve headaches.
*   **Sandalwood:** This grounding and balancing essential oil⁢ can⁣ definitely help reduce‌ stress, promote relaxation, and enhance meditation.⁢ It's a popular choice for‌ meditation candles.
*  ⁤ **Rose:** ‌Frequently enough associated with⁢ love and compassion, rose‍ essential oil ‌can definitely help uplift the mood, reduce stress, and promote feelings of well-being.*​   **Citrus​ (e.g., Lemon, Orange, Grapefruit):** Citrus essential oils are ​known for their uplifting and energizing properties. they can definitely help boost mood, reduce stress, and improve​ focus.Many home ‌fragrance​ blends include ‌citrus elements.

I'm looking for high quality tank tops and shorts that will hold up in the wash. I like nerd shit--anime, fantasy vibes, DnD.

I want to steer clear of Redbubble and Etsy unless people can vouch for quality. I'm tired of ordering something and finding out the print is an iron-on that will flake during washing.

A design I like from the Wizard of Barge: [link](https://wizardofbarge.com/cdn/shop/files/ThreeCoffeeNoLunchMock.jpg?v=1729177698)

1ji5v5a,https://www.reddit.com/r/spinalcordinjuries/comments/1ji5v5a/should_sci_victims_be_offered_assisted_dying/,Should SCI victims be offered assisted dying?,"It is coming up to about two years since I suffered a mountaineering accident, which left me a C5/C6 complete. 

If anything, I'm doing about as well as could be expected given my injury. I live in my own apartment, have avoided any major health problems since the accident, and have even gone back to work as a university teacher. All this requires 24 hour care, however, as I can do none of the basics for myself anymore and I've periodically had serious problems with AD. 

I have tried really hard since the day I woke up. I still forced myself to do strength training exercises, and can even transfer in and out of bed with minimal assistance. I am not in pain. From what I understand, I have it about as good as a quad with my level of injury could hope for.

And the problem is that this is still so mindbendingly shit that I have no desire to continue. Or rather, I haven't wanted to do this since the day I woke up in hospital, and not a single day has passed since when I've changed my mind about that. No matter how hard I've tried, and how much ""progress"" I've made, it never feels worth it.

I miss exercise so much. I miss nature. I miss the outdoors. I miss travelling. I miss adventures. I miss spontaneity. I miss being free to do what I want, when I want, without constantly needing other people to help me. I used to be a really fit rock climber, who never had a problem meeting women. I broke up with my long-term partner just before the accident, and it seems pretty clear that is the last person I will ever have intimacy with. It is not only that I cannot imagine any same woman wanting to be more than just friends with me, it is also that I cannot imagine ever letting anybody in again. The thought of being naked in front of anybody other than the professional carers who help me shit just fills me with horror.

And I cannot get used to the humiliation. Every day, shitting in bed, being washed down like a farmyard animal, by people I have nothing to say to, nothing in common with, but who are always around in some capacity or another. I can't even make myself a cup of coffee, just sit on the couch and read a book by myself. Friends have been good to me, but I can feel everybody slipping away, as their lives naturally move on, and I just stay stuck, becoming evermore isolated, bored and miserable every day.

I HATE this.

I was never asked if I was okay being kept alive at this cost. I certainly never agreed to it. I am sure I would never have.

To me, it therefore seems that a sane and fair society should give me the option of quitting. That medical professionals should say ""okay, you've given this a good shot, but we respect the fact that it is just not for you. We will therefore help you put an end to this in a dignified manner.""

Instead, I'm forced to stay alive, because here in the UK assisted dying is illegal and anybody who helps me faces 14 years in jail.

But how do other people with SCI feel about this? I am interested if there are people who felt like me once, but are glad that they stuck it out? Personally, I can't imagine changing my mind. Really I'm just passing the time until I die. If somebody could speed that up, I would very much take the option. Of course, people who want to carry on should be helped and supported in doing so. But I do not think it is right to force people like me to continue.

I love my coffee because it's a drug and I genuinely feel the buzz of caffeine...but id be lying if I didn't say my black coffee tastes like piss. Mind you, freshly ground pour over coffee tastes less like piss than cheap preground crap...but it still tastes like piss.

Then we have super hoppy beers and cocktails like negronis and at first i thought people were either pretending to like this shit or literally don't have the taste receptors for bitter...or maybe taste it differently like cilantro?

My best guess is that things that make you high make you like them regardless of how they taste. Now whiskey isn't bitter but I love a good single malt whiskey BUT I completely understand why it's horrendous to others...because it is. I think it's because my brain associated the high with good quality whiskey so it's got a nostalgic beautiful taste to it. It's psychological...and isn't actually real.

Idk. All I know is that bitter tastes like ass...so why do so many like it?",1,1742754016.0,TooAfraidToAsk,13,0.6,False

So I (26F) am new in a city, looking for a date. And this guy(26M) from bumble had been talking with me for a few days. After matching, he came and talked to me first with an interesting topic so i was hooked. I was pretty interested in him, and we had a lot of similarities (like both Asians, did the same degree, and working in the same field) He asked if I am open to meet, so I suggested coffee and we were about to meet halfway coz we live 45 minutes away. I suggested a cute coffee place. 

We were gonna meet last week but he had an exam so we planned for this Sunday like he suggested. 

As i am pretty interested, i prepared a lot, like icebreakers, which topics to talk about, and even researched the degree he is doing and the field he is working in coz i am just interested in him. 

And today, we were about to meet in the afternoon, i was gonna commute by train to that place. He and i confirmed yesterday about the time and city, i sent him the coffee shop. 

And now what do you think? He unmatched this morning. 

At least tell me you couldn’t make it :)

1ji5sr7,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1ji5sr7/should_i_end_friendship_with_this_friend/,Should I end friendship with this friend?,"I (30f) have been friends with this girl Karen (25f) for 2-3 years. Before we would hangout rarely maybe once in a while but for last couple of months we've been hanging out almost 1-2 times a week. But what bothers me is that I am not sure is she hanging out with me just out of boredroom and to kill time or she is really building friendship with me. She is the one who often intiates hangouts but our text conversations are really dry, her responses seem like I am bothering her, she just answers ,,yes and no'' in that tone and she never shares anything with me, even IRL. I feel like I can't read her if you know what I mean.

I feel like I don't know anything about her personal life, she never talks about what she has done in her daily life, never shares about her plans, I know that she has a boyfriend of 6 years, that is longdistance relationship and I know she meets him maybe 2-3 times a year but what I find weird is that she never talks about him or her relationship and every girl I know talks about these things with female friends. Also I feel like she feels uncomfortable around me for some reason; she often smiles in shy way, she acts like she sees me for the first time ever, and we talk almost always about same stuff: work, and movies and shows what we watched, and she asks me weird random questions for example : ,,what you hate when other people do'' and sometimes I feel like she just talk for the sake of talking but we are not really having connection and conversation, if you know what I mean? And when we are both quite there is some weird tension that I feel. And our interaction is mostly about teasing each other. Also last time when we had lunch together we mention like lets share food and she said ,,I like you that much that I would even share food with you''

Also we both often mention like lets to something else not just coffee hangout (movies tripis etc) and she agrees and seems into it but never mentions it again. Also I know she has severe social anxiety she shared with me some personal stuff and I am highly understanding of it, and once I asked her is she uncomfortable around me she said no, although like I feel like she is. i really like her as a friend she is fun, has good humor we share similar taste in many things but lots of times when I share something with her she never gives me feedback and her introversion is too much for me that I feel uncomfortable. I am not expecting to chat with someone 24/7 I have one friend with who I don't chat for weeks and then we send long voice messages or texts about something but her texts are like I am texting with work boss, too formal and just tooo dry. Also IRL she never showed excitiment about anything she has like ,,poker face''

I had these type of friendship where I actually never connected with people we hangout out of habit or routine and I just don't want this anymore, I would rather be totally alone than have superficial ,,friends''",1,1742753886.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False
1ji5spy,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ji5spy/i_25f_just_discovered_that_my_boyfriend_27m_of_3/,I (25F) just discovered that my boyfriend (27M) of 3 years has been chatting with some girl from his gym. What would you do?,"At first, I thought it was harmless, but then I saw some of their conversations and let's just say it didn't look very innocent. I confronted him about it, and he swore that nothing was going on, but I'm not buying it. I've been snooping around (don't judge me) and I found out that he's been meeting up with her for 'workouts' at 6 am every morning. I'm talking coffee dates, 'accidental' touches, and flirtatious comments. I feel like I've been living a lie.

I'm still trying to process everything that's happened. I feel like I'm in a whirlwind of emotions (sadness, anger, betrayal, and confusion). I keep thinking about all the times he told me he loved me, all the times he said I was his everything. Was it all a lie? I thought we had something real, something special. But I guess I was just blind to the truth.

I've been thinking about all the signs I ignored, all the red flags I brushed off. Like the time he 'forgot' to mention that he had gone out with his friends the night before, or the time he 'accidentally' left his phone at home and I couldn't reach him for hours. I thought it was just my imagination, that I was being paranoid. But now I realize that I was just ignoring the truth.

I don't know what to do. Part of me wants to confront him, to scream at him and ask him why he did what he did. But another part of me just wants to curl up in a ball and cry, to forget about the whole thing and pretend it never happened. I feel like I'm losing my mind, like I'm trapped in some kind of never-ending nightmare.

I know I need to take care of myself, to prioritize my own well-being. But it's hard when all I can think about is him, and what he's been doing behind my back. I feel like I'm addicted to the drama, to the thrill of the rollercoaster ride that is our relationship.

So I broke up with my boyfriend after a year together back in jan. He took 9 months to tell his family about me, and 10 to ask me to actually be his girlfriend, however by this point, we were certainly together. He was going out with other girls for coffee but didn’t see the issue with not telling me for months. He also accused me of cheating as I turned my location off, however I did this as i got incredibly sick, not being able to walk so was going nowhere. He would text me saying a girl won’t stop texting him but never actually told them he was seeing someone, despite me encouraging him to say that. The list goes on, so needless to say I broke up with him (even though he couldn’t understand why). 

I got back together with him a month or so later as I felt I didn’t give him a chance. I explained my feelings and he said he loved to hear where he went wrong and that i should have said earlier (as if communication was the issue…). First week back was great. I got flowers from him for the first time, and it seemed better UNTIL he said the reason I broke up with him must have been because me and my family were jealous of his achievements! He was making it very clear that he did not know what my issues were, and couldn’t see a problem with his behaviour, despite him seeming pretty coherent when we rekindled. He also turned everyone against me after the first breakup, but then said it’s my problem what people think of me. He also had a (very close!!) girl friend who he shared all our relationship-related info with. 
He would spend hours at her house and she also spent time at his, but he said he was just confiding in her. 

My final straw was him asking me how much my rates were, got up and threw £300 of cash at me whilst I was on the bed, albeit doing it jokingly and I went along with it. I just don’t think this is something one should do whilst trying again with the relationship. I ended things a few days ago as it just wasn’t working. Aside from all that, we had a fun relationship! 

I feel as if I didn’t really express my feelings enough in the relationship, and maybe instead of ending things, I should have said more of how I felt? Or should he have just used common sense to not treat me like that?

I hired a personal teacher, she is 4 years older than me (early 30s), and im late 20s. She is a fantastic teacher, funny, and I respect her a lot since she has helped me massively.

I was never really into her, but with time and after 6 months doing weekly lessons, she kinda grew into me, but I wasnt really crazy about it, there were times where she jokingly flirted with me and i simply didnt reject it and played a long.

Long story short, 6 months in im fired from my current job so I have to leave to another town, having to stop those lessons. She asks for a date before I leave, I kinda accept because I don't know how to say ""no"" , and in the end after so much lessons I wanted to have a farewell.

The date was a simply coffee date, that I considered a farewell, I did 0 moves. Couple weeks later she calls me back to the city to invite me to some ""language learning event"" , since it was interesting I accepted and did come, it was all cool but its obvious she was flirting with me, while I let it slip, I took her home and she almost kissed me but I did put my cheek.

Couple weeks after, she calls me to the cinema, again Im uncapable of saying no, even tho I dont want to have any love/flirt relationship with her, I accept since the movie was actually cool and I wanted to see it anyway. I walked her home, and she was extremely flirty / clingy / etc, was almost begging for me to go to her home. But im just not into her, and its not because shes ugly, shes actually OK, but I still see her as my teacher and im not in the mood of starting things up now.

I straight up told her what I was thinking, that my current priorities are not dating, and I have enjoyed my times with her, but I want to make it clear that im not looking for any dating/sex whatever. She simply said ""ok"" , but I still feel like shit, because I feel like I've wasted her time, and played with her emotions. On top of that she is a fantastic teacher, and now Im afraid that if I ever want to start the lessons again it will be awkward as hell.

In the original, Leon only fought against Krauser to defeat his former partner and continue with his mission.

But he became corrupt and fell into disgrace after the Javier operation. And to make matters worse, he killed Luis, Leon's best friend, previously.
Krauser used the plague to transform.

Losing both his arms. This shows how insane Krauser was. So desperate for power that he sacrificed both his arms and his ability to live a normal life.

I’m 32 years old now, and I’ve finally chosen to learn how to ride a motorcycle—something I’ve been ""putting to sleep"" for years. Maybe it’s because I have a typical mother who doesn’t want to hear about it. Or maybe it's because something else always came up? I’ve ridden as a passenger on motorcycles and scooters a few times, and I always thought about how amazing that feeling is.

Now, to the point—I live in a relatively small Greek town, I have a car license, but I don’t own a car. I’m excited about learning to ride a motorcycle and going on rides and trips to nearby areas. I don’t want it for commuting to work or getting a coffee in the city center—walking serves me just fine for that! I believe I’m realistic about what I want from a motorcycle and how I plan to use it. I won’t buy a bike unless I first get a full, high-quality protective gear set, and I won’t hesitate to spend good money on a helmet. I also don’t plan to get a ""beast"" as my first bike. I don’t care about squeezing between cars just to be first at the traffic light. From what I’ve read, there’s also a riding school in Greece, which I’ll attend once I get my license and my first motorcycle.

**What terrifies me, though, are the comments like ""motorcycle = death"" or ""if you don’t die, you’ll end up paralyzed,"" etc.** Of course, anyone who gets on a bike knows the risks. But should all this negativity stop me from learning, buying a motorcycle, and enjoying rides in the countryside with friends or just by myself?",6,1742753511.0,motorcycles,10,0.87,False
