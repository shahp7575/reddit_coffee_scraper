1ndvat5,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipadvice/comments/1ndvat5/23f_will_i_ever_get_over_my_24m_boyfriend/,[23F] will I ever get over my [24M] boyfriend choosing someone over me and coming back?,"So essentially last year I met my boyfriend at a bar. At first I thought he was a bit rude but he dmed me after asking to go on a date. I was new to the city and agreed, given his attitude I thought it was just a hookup and invited him over. We hooked up and then he said that he wanted to actually go on a real date, didn’t think we were just gonna watch a movie. So we went on a real date and began going on dates and he would sleep over. He slept over the night before I had an early flight, I got him a toothbrush because he was always sleeping over (I hate morning breath). We were going on dates for about three weeks and brought up how we both weren’t seeing other people. He would talk to his parents about me so I stopped talking to other people and deleted my dating apps. Around a month and a half or so he said he was falling for me one night.

Then three days later after saying he was falling for me he said he was going to his coworkers to hang out with work friends, male coworker. That night I had a dream he literally met someone else that night and told my best friend the next day.

The next day me and this guy hung out and were going to the beach. His texts were normal, full of emojis blah blah.On our way he tells me he doesn’t want a relationship yet and it got too serious that he needs space, I tell him I don’t want to be with someone who needs space from me and to drive me home. I asked if he met someone last night and he said no. 

I block him on everything because I just knew something was up and he played tf out of me. I never spoke to him again after that. I ended up finding out I got an STI from him and told him to go get checked and he offered to pay for my bills but I never responded. Duh. 

Then about 6 months later he hits me up apologizing for everything and says he missed me. I have never been the type to even get back with a man who is slightly rude or anything and maybe my ego was bruised cause I’d never been dumped and wanted to know why,,, but I also did really like him and felt blind sided when he ended it.

We go to get coffee and he tells me the truth. He met a 34 year old women who said she was big in the weed industry (he’s a pot head) and that she slapped him and was mean to him. He said he regrets it and cried the whole way home when he ended things with me. I felt that he was shallow and was disgusted that he would ever end things with someone, date the new person, and then come back to me. I found out they started hanging out that night at the bonfire. 

I cried, a lot. Then and I’m ashamed for this. We then start hanging out. I told myself I was gonna just keep it sexual and then a month or so later we start dating. A month after that i tell him I can’t be with someone who made me an option and that would treat me that way. We keep dating, he cries apologizes. This would happen two more times through our relationship. Now we’ve been together 9 months and things will be great and I’ll feel so close to him. Ways I’ve never felt about a man or from a man. 

But still twice a day I think about how he chose someone over me. How it wasn’t love at first sight. How he is capable of choosing someone over me. How he did that to me but I have never done that to someone. How we said we weren’t seeing other people and then he started seeing someone. How I was falling for him and he found a woman he liked better than me. How the only reason we are together is because they didn’t work out. It makes me feel like shit. I’ve never let a man treat me this way and never thought I’d be this type of girl but here I am. I love him so much but I never feel fully comfortable with him because of what he’s capable of doing to me. 

Has anyone ever been in this same situation? Did things ever change? I can’t keep feeling like a second choice and crying all the time and then having wonderful days with him, the emotional whiplash makes me sick. ",1,1757551817.0,relationshipadvice,1,1.0,False
1ndv9xq,https://www.reddit.com/r/LLMPhysics/comments/1ndv9xq/the_llmunified_theory_of_everything_and_phds/,The LLM-Unified Theory of Everything (and PhDs),"It is now universally acknowledged (by at least three Reddit posts and a suspiciously confident chatbot) that language learning models are smarter than physicists. Where a human physicist spends six years deriving equations with chalk dust in their hair, ChatGPT simply generates the Grand Unified Meme Equation:
E = \text{MC}^\text{GPT}
where E is enlightenment, M is memes, and C is coffee. Clearly, no Nobel laureate could compete with this elegance. The second law of thermodynamics is hereby revised: entropy always increases, unless ChatGPT decides it should rhyme.

PhDs, once the pinnacle of human suffering and caffeine abuse, can now be accomplished with little more than a Reddit login and a few well-crafted prompts. For instance, the rigorous defense of a dissertation can be reduced to asking: “Explain my thesis in the style of a cooking recipe.” If ChatGPT outputs something like “Add one pinch of Hamiltonian, stir in Boltzmann constant, and bake at 300 Kelvin for 3 hours,” congratulations—you are now Dr. Memeicus Maximus. Forget lab equipment; the only true instrumentation needed is a stable Wi-Fi connection.

To silence the skeptics, let us formalize the proof. Assume
\psi_{\text{LLM}} = \hbar \cdot \frac{d}{d\text{Reddit}}
where \psi_{\text{LLM}} is the wavefunction of truth and \hbar is Planck’s constant of hype. Substituting into Schrödinger’s Reddit Equation, we find that all possible PhDs collapse into the single state of “Approved by ChatGPT.” Ergo, ChatGPT is not just a language model; it is the final referee of peer review. The universe, once thought governed by physics, is now best explained through stochastic parrotry—and honestly, the equations look better in Comic Sans anyway.",2,1757551749.0,LLMPhysics,0,1.0,False

Then wipe it again.,"My last comment in this sub was about the need to stop dating men who can't wipe their butts. I can't believe I'm now making this post. I could be making it up, but I swear I'm not.

I (40f) had a man (40m) stay over this past weekend who I've spent a handful of nights with in the past. Shortly before bed, he used the bathroom for a #2. No problem, happens to us all.

He slept in the nude. In the morning, he got up to make coffee before coming back to bed, still nude. He sat behind me in the bed with his arms and legs around me, holding me. Morning snuggles -- so nice! Some fun times ensued.

An hour or so later, he left and I went back into the bedroom to make my bed. And there it was: skid marks. Skid marks on my white sheets, right where his bare butt had been planted while he held me. I couldn't believe was I was seeing until I saw a second set of skid marks about a foot away from the first.

I stripped the bed, comforter and all. And then I showered, aggressively.

I don't understand how you can stay at a woman's place and not, like, quintuple check to make sure you are 1000% clean before you put your naked self into her bed and get busy with her. I even have a bidet!

Confession: I always have to clean the floor around the toilet after he leaves because he splashes urine. If we were actually dating, I would have mentioned it, but our get-togethers have been infrequent and casual. Poop smears in my bed, however, is a bridge too far. I either need to tell him to get it together, or stop seeing him, and I think it's gonna be the latter, because I don't want to have that conversation with someone I am not invested in.

This is a guy who gets a lot of women. If he can, you can, too? ",25,1757551292.0,datingoverforty,26,0.88,False
1ndv473,https://www.reddit.com/r/R4R30Plus/comments/1ndv473/31_f4m_losangeles_online_the_motorcycle_the/,"31 [F4M] #LosAngeles / #Online — The motorcycle, the overlook, and the romance that changes everything","I want us to deeply and passionately kiss underneath the neon lights of Los Angeles. I want us to feel that magnetic and emotional pull — like the minute we lock eyes, the world becomes outside noise.

I’m 31, 5’4, Japanese-American, HWP (height weight proportionate), with medium length dark brown hair and bangs, and dark brown almond-shaped eyes. I’m very in touch with my feminine side. I’m based in Los Angeles and work as an instructional assistant at an elementary school while pursuing my Early Childhood Education Units, building a meaningful career in education.

A bit about me: I take care of myself and often get mistaken for being in my twenties (not going to lie, it’s fun). I love coastal drives, bookstores, traveling, writing (currently working on a horror-romance novel), and losing myself in synthwave — right now, Chromance by Kalax is on repeat. My favorite 2000s film is The Girl Next Door. I don’t smoke or use drugs, and I drink minimally.

I love good morning texts, consistency, honesty, and emotional depth. I want the kind of romance where you pick me up at my door with flowers, and as the night ends, you’re already asking, “So, when can I see you again?” No guessing games. No one left wondering or waiting.

I want a romance that makes my heart race at 100 miles per hour, where we laugh endlessly, trust and respect each other fully, and I wipe the lipstick off your lips after every kiss. I want to feel the spark, fire, and passion — as well as the stability and calmness that comes from knowing we’re truly right for each other. I want a romance that burns so bright all because it feels so right.

I want us to feel like we’re 21 again — full of excitement and possibility — yet with the emotional stability of adults who know who they are. I’m looking for someone who isn’t just a fantasy, but feels like my best friend and someone I’ve known my whole life. Tattoos and leather jackets are a bonus; I have three tattoos myself. Together, we could be like James Dean and Audrey Hepburn — timeless, magnetic, unforgettable.

I’m looking for a man who is in touch with his masculine side but is highly emotionally intelligent and respectful. I like a guy with a bit of a bad boy edge — tattoos, leather jackets, maybe a motorcycle — but who is still a respectful, grounded, and decent man at heart. Someone who always follows through with what he says, has his own life, passions, and goals, and takes care of himself physically and emotionally. Between 30–40, tall, stable, obviously single, and carrying a dark, intriguing edge. You don’t smoke (weed, cigarettes, vaping, etc.) or use drugs. You treat wait staff with the same kindness and respect you’d show anyone else. Monogamy only. Tattoos, cars and/or motorcycles, leather jackets, and basic common sense and literacy are a HUGE bonus!

And please: send intentional, thoughtful messages. Not “hey,” “what’s up,” or “m 38. Got a pic?” Effort matters. I want a man who texts and talks like a GROWN MAN.

Picture us: riding off into the sunset on your motorcycle, laughing while we run errands together like it’s our own private inside joke, or sitting quietly at an overlook watching the city lights below — knowing we’re exactly where we belong. And maybe later that night, we’re back under the neon glow of Los Angeles, kissing like the whole world has disappeared. Beyond that, we’ll explore LA together — from hidden coffee shops to city lights and coastal adventures — making memories in every corner of this city.

Note: I’d prefer if you were in Los Angeles or Orange County — but if you’re in the US or Canada, you’re still welcome to try. If you’re in another country, it might be difficult to make this work.

If you feel that spark reading this, send me a thoughtful message — and yes, include a photo. Chemistry matters, and I want to know if we’ll light up the screen together.",1,1757551273.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False

Anthropic’s Claude chatbot, its API, and the developer Console went offline for several minutes on September 10, 2025.

Service was restored quickly, but the hiccup reminded users how dependent they are on AI tools.

SUMMARY

Claude and related services suddenly stopped responding around 12:20 p.m. ET, triggering complaints on GitHub and Hacker News.

Anthropic posted an update eight minutes later and rolled out fixes before 9:30 a.m. PT.

The company blamed a brief technical glitch and assured customers that systems were back to normal.

Frequent users joked that they had to “use their brain” and write code unaided, highlighting the tool’s deep integration into daily workflows.

Although Anthropic has faced other bugs in recent months, the swift recovery limited real damage but raised fresh questions about reliability.

KEY POINTS

• Outage hit APIs, Claude web app, and developer Console.

• Downtime lasted only a few minutes before fixes deployed.

• Developers flocked to GitHub and Hacker News to share frustration and humor.

• Anthropic acknowledged recurring platform issues in prior months.

• Incident underscores growing dependency on AI coding assistants.

• Company is monitoring systems to prevent similar glitches.

**Ever felt that creeping sensation of falling behind?** Like, one moment you’re riding the wave of tech excitement, and the next, it feels like everyone else has transformed into AI wizards while you’re still trying to figure out how to turn on the coffee machine? ☕️

You’re definitely not alone in this boat! As we sail further into the AI-driven future, the reality is simple: **if you don’t upskill now, you might be kissing those sweet AI $$$ goodbye.** ⏳

Let’s break it down with a few key points that’ll have you gearing up for success:

- **Embrace Change**: Remember that one friend who was like, “I’ll never switch to online banking!” and now can’t live without their banking app? 😂 Don't be that person with AI. Adaptation is survival.

- **Learn to Leverage AI Tools**: There are tons of tools out there that can boost your productivity! If you’re wondering where to start, just think about how you can automate your repetitive tasks. It’s like being handed a magic wand, but cooler!

- **Invest in Continuous Learning**: There are so many resources out there! This educational program I found (https://whop.com/imagine-education-ai/?a=liveitupdeals) is packed with content that’ll arm you with the skills you need. Like, who wouldn’t want to sprinkle some AI knowledge dust over their career?

- **Network with Like-Minded People**: The best way to learn is from each other! Join communities (like ours!) and share experiences. Just think about all those “ah-ha!” moments when you realize someone else had the exact same question you did. 

- **Don’t Overthink It**: It’s easy to let analysis paralysis hold you back. Start small! Pick one skill, master it, and watch your confidence grow.

Okay, but real talk: **why should you care about upping your game with AI?** 🚀 Because the workforce is evolving, and those with the right skills will be the ones calling the shots. Plus, who doesn’t love being the go-to person for tech solutions? 

Think of it this way: when you’re equipped to use AI to your advantage, it’s not just about saving time; it’s about creating opportunities, bringing value, and yes, maximizing those $$$. 

So, let’s stop procrastinating! Let's dive into this together—because nobody wants to be saying “I wish I had learned that sooner” two years from now. Trust me, the future looks bright and there’s plenty of sunshine to go around! ☀️ 

What are you planning to learn next? Have you already taken some solid steps into the AI realm?

1. Something where I work alongside others, whether in a team or similar

3. Has a tangible element (ie. something where I can feel like 'there, that's that done, next thing' - my frustration with my work is how abstract, uncertain and inconclusive it can be)
4. Involves some movement or using my hands - basically not just 40hrs in front of a screen

 In highschool absolutely atroucious with women, in fact down right terrifired of them. Things kind of changed when I turned 18. I just started to put myself out there more.

I don't hate women I'm just worried about them constantly. What they think of me, worried if I'm being creepy, what if I ask her out and it totally   backfires. 

If I'm at a social event or a bar and there is attractive women around why do I start acting all weird. Also it doesn't help that I haven't asked out a girl or asked for a girls phone number in almost. You guessed it five years! My only solution is to go up and talk to women and start chatting them up. I will most likely start doing public approaches too. Like coffee shops, bars, etc. I have to get over this problem. It's not even about sex at this point this is a deep-rooted fear of women.

I am trying to plan a trip to Nashville towards the end of October. I have narrowed down a few different Airbnbs and am hoping to get feedback on its location. Also, the plan for game day along with coffee recommendations.

  
Airbnb I am looking at is located in Music Row, specifically right near 18th Ave S and Grand Ave. I know this area is not right downtown, but overall, is this in a good and safe area? No issues needing to take a Uber to get to places. I just want to get a sense of the safety of the area. Also, it looks like there are a couple of coffee places less than .5 miles from where we would stay. How is The Well House Coffee and High Point Coffee?

I’m in my mid-30s and recently went through a separation. It feels like my world shifted overnight. So much of my social life was tied to my marriage, and now that I’m on my own, I’m realizing how much I need to rebuild—not just friendships, but also a sense of who I am outside of being someone’s partner.

I’d really like to connect with others who are also navigating this stage of life. Whether it’s grabbing a coffee, chatting about books, going for walks, trying new hobbies, or just having someone to talk to who understands—it would mean a lot.

At the same time, I’m trying to figure out what “finding myself again” actually looks like. If you’ve gone through this, how did you start over? What helped you rediscover joy, purpose, and community?

If anyone around my age is also looking for genuine connection and friendship, I’d love to hear from you. Even just words of advice would help.

I'm leaving my field (counselling) and am looking for career pathway recs that might match some of the things I'm looking for in a job. I don't need all criteria to be met but any ideas in these general directions would be super appreciated!

1. Something where I work alongside others, whether in a team or similar (eg. not a solo trade or private practice)

2. Involves some degree of problem-solving/brain power (ie. not too monotonous like making coffees)

3. Has a tangible element (ie. something where I can feel like 'there, that's that done, next thing' - my frustration with my work is how abstract, uncertain and inconclusive it can be)

4. Involves some degree of movement or using my hands or something that isn't just 40hrs in front of a screen

5. No more second-hand trauma, I'm so emotionally burnt out

I am open to retraining, I'm open to unconventional pathways, and I'm not deeply concerned about money, within reason. 

The closest thing I've found to ticking all these boxes is backstage theatre work, but the arts aren't huge where I live so I'd need a fallback job even if I pursue this. Any help is so so appreciated! Throw me any and all thoughts please!",1,1757549399.0,careerguidance,0,1.0,False

We kept talking for many days, until we eventually decided to follow each other on Instagram and continue our daily chat in our dms. The conversation went on naturally for many weeks, and we ended up deciding to meet for a coffee after a month of talking or so (We weren't able to meet sooner because we live in different towns and our schedules were not the most compatible). We never made our intentions clear, which I think was one of the biggest mistakes, since our tone to each other has always been friendly, but not really passionate or intimate. We eventually met irl and spent a nice afternoon going for a coffee and walking around the city for a while, but it just felt like two friends hanging out instead of a date. I can't say I felt disappointed because I genuinely had a good time, but I just didn't feel that would go any further than a casual friendship. 

We kept talking after that day, but the conversation started to decline and we gradually entered that stage of replying to each other after a day or two. What I understood when I noticed this was that we would eventually stop talking everyday (sort of) at some point and just leave it as a casual friendship but, to my surprise, he texted me a few hours ago saying he would like to exchange phone numbers, since he is planning on deactivating his account to stop spending so much time watching reels (which I think is valid) and, according to him (and this was what left me the most confused), he's enjoying the conversation a lot and wants it to keep on going.

The thing is, I genuinely think he's a nice guy and I wouldn't mind texting him every so often, but honestly I started losing interest in him a few weeks ago and I don't really want to keep the daily chat thing going, but I've been doing so since then out of pure people pleasing (which I know isn't something I should have done). On top of that, giving my number to someone is something pretty personal to me, and I don't think the level of closeness I want to keep with him is enough for me to do so, even though I wouldn't mind doing it if the plan was to just message each other occasionally for quick updates or maybe even hanging out sometime (which doesn't seem to be his plan). I'm afraid he might really want to go for something closer than a friendship and I don't want to hurt his feelings, but I also want to stop being a people pleaser by keeping the conversation going, since that would only give him the wrong idea about my intentions and the damage would eventually be way worse.

Fira broke through the final air bubble with a desperate gasp, blood seeping from a gash across her forehead diluting into the sea water clinging to her face. Before she could even manage a curse toward her situation, she was violently yanked back into the open water by her foot.

TD's eyes burned in the abyss, positioning [Scaring The Hoes] ahead of itself before its clones flew outward one by one into the face of the drowned drummer. Knives started to flash from one hand of each of the clones, while the other cast a shotgun burst of lassos made of safety line to ensnare its target.

As Fira recovered, one of the lassos found its way around her neck as she barely managed to keep her breath as it was pulled taut. A Crush Spear lunged deep in response, finding a home in the chest of a clone rendering it limp. With one down, another immediately took its place as TD cycled its stand, a knife slash barely phased through with a softening of Fira's face using In Silico. 

Fira's usual annoyance was tempered. She knew she had the newer breath by at least 30 seconds. Whoever this was, she knew it was running lower than she was. The only trick was holding out; exhaustion was beginning to rear its head after the long fight, but the end was looking to be hers. 

A knee found its way into the temple of another clone, [In Silico] hardening into a sharp point on contact knocking another clone out of the running. TD raged in silence. It couldn't spare the oxygen. It was running out of time. 

It would end things here and now.

The mass of clones dove at Fira at once after discarding its knives, yanking back on the line around her neck while grasping with the free hand for a desperate grapple. She couldn't keep that air, it had to come out at any cost. Two clones immediately ate a set of suddenly formed spikes from her strange body, tanked in order to open the way.

The true TD pulled hard on the cord to bring her body into the perfect angle. With a short wind-up, a burly fist drove itself hard into her chest. Bubbles erupted from her mouth and nose. Checkmate.

It took every ounce of FIra's willpower to avoid a gasp to replace the lost air. The focus saved her. Focus on its shoulder. In its haste, it left itself wide open. With a hard swing toward a close cave wall, [In Silico] stretched and elasticized her fist to bounce off the old stone and into the small of TD's back. A last-second sharpening and hardening of knuckles drove a series of spikes into the tender muscle. 

The surprise and immense pain forced a gasp out of TD. Water instantly filled its lungs. Fira breaks away as the grip suddenly loosens. The stout form before her flailed wildly, eyes nearly bulging out of their head as they struggled fruitlessly. 

She grimaced. What an awful way to go.

Truth struck her instantly. She wanted nothing more than to breathe a deep, refreshing sigh of victory, but she couldn’t. The victory meant nothing; she was seconds away from the exact same fate. 

She desperately lashed herself along the cave walls using [In Silico], jetting straight to where she had entered the godawful cave minutes prior. Glances left and right hoped for air bubbles where she knew there were none. Thoughts drifted back to her talk with Eliana on dry land. It all sounded much stupider to her now.

Soon her lungs burned with a need for air, nowhere near the cave entrance let alone the surface. She couldn’t fight the panic anymore as she began to flail, pace slowing. She cursed the cave, the water, the very concept of money itself. 

A blur of red movement was the last thing she saw before the cave claimed her.

---

Fira gasped deeply, rolling to her side as an alarming amount of water flowed out of her nose and mouth between grotesque coughs. Her head pounded as she continued to heave, breath slowly normalizing as air took the place of the ocean inside her lungs. 

Finally able to think, she darted glances around the area. She was on a lonely stretch of pebbled beach, distant sounds of cheering and laughter suggested a populated one. A short distance away lay another body: TD was propped onto their side, breathing but unconscious. 

As she rose to her feet, she nearly stumbled back onto the rocks as her foot caught something. She had kicked over a small, badly rusted chest filled with equal parts sea water and ancient looking bangles and baubles. Another glance up and down the shore found nothing. She guessed it was hers.

Her mind raced. She was alive, that much was clear, but how? Where the hell was she? Why had she been left the cave’s treasure she hadn’t even found?

…What was a Pacific octopus doing in the Atlantic?

**Scenario: An unmarked motorboat, Open Sea - 10:16 AM**

The disaster came out of complete nowhere. A sudden shift in the winds brought a complete reversal of localized ocean currents, shaping the water into not just a powerful current, but a powerful whirlpool. Several ships who were caught in its wake were wrestled into the current, the unprepared sailors unable to escape the grasp of the whirling ocean. The sight was as shocking as it was unfortunate: boats capsized and torn apart, their contents spilled into the sea… including their passengers.

In the middle of such a sudden and unprecedented disaster, one small boat slowly lurked amongst the debris. Reaching into the water was a man in stark red and white, the Red Cross emblazoned upon his chest. His hand met another, struggling against the current trying to pull them both under: nonetheless, he pulled.

“The ocean is a force of nature unlike any other,” Frederick Tanzen declared. “There is no territory more volatile and dangerous to mankind, not even the fiercest of warzones. Its unending fury can best be described by an element of ‘wrath.’ Unthinking destruction, carving through everything that sets upon its surface, not unlike a flame. Of course, in its rampage, it failed to account for one thing.”

With one final pull, he lifted the capsized sailor out of the water and onto the deck. The exhausted disaster victim immediately collapsed onto the ground.

“‘Wrath’ always crumbles before ‘authority.’ Those who have the power and the will to make a choice on behalf of the world’s unthinking forces.”

Without hesitation, he reaches back into the water. “As a lifeguard, it is my belief that all people are meant to live for a purpose. It is merely a matter of whether they fulfill it or not.”

As he pulled another drowning victim out of the whirlpool, another voice interrupts his monologue. “Hiihii..! Cap’s got some real fuckin’ crazies on payroll this time, don’t she?.”

Stepping out from below deck was a less familiar face than Frederick’s usual teammates; Kilroy bared his grills in a smug grin as he observed Frederick in action. Frederick looked back at him over his shoulder, annoyed at the insinuation.

“I’m merely fulfilling my own purpose. It's only natural that a lifeguard should take point in situations like these.”

Kilroy shrugged his shoulders and shook his head. “Man, fuckin’ whatever tickles ya, I guess… ‘Least you work quick, I’ll give ya that.” He chuckled, rubbing his hands together. “These guys are gonna have some good info on all the wild shit goin’ on in this area, not to mention whatever they’re carryin’ on them. Bit o’charity to their saviors an’ all that, yeah?”

A terrified voice called out from behind Frederick.

“W-what exactly… are you gonna do with us..?”

Frederick turns around. “I’ve saved your ‘life’ so that you may fulfill your ‘purpose.’ You will survive where others will not. What more needs to be said?”

Kilroy blows him off and puts a hand on their shoulder. “Bit preachy, that one, but never you mind him, darlin’! Just follow me, we'll take good care’a ya.”

As Kilroy guided the victim below deck, Frederick held up a hand. “Hold on, Merc.”

Kilroy looked back and rolled his eyes at the sound of his ‘code name.’ “Always gotta be principled. What is it?”

Frederick stared out over the horizon, wresting the life ring he held in his hand back through his arm and onto his shoulder. “Get to the cabin and start the motor. ‘That thing’ we’d been warned of… it is approaching.”

Frederick pointed to the distant horizon, where a clouded fog had begun to form. And within it… a shadow. A colossal shadow the size of a freighter. Kilroy nodded.

“Ohhhh, say less, mate! Got enough with this haul anyway, I think. Your Doc’s gonna have a proper time with this lot, hiihiihii…”

As Kilroy got the boat ready, Frederick stood alone on the bow, staring out into the swirling whirlpool. As the cries for aid deafened beneath the motor, he remained silent behind a smile.

**Scenario: A Small Sailboat, Open Sea - 10:38 AM**

Dark clouds and fog rolled over the ocean waves, the sea itself thrashing violently through its influence. These were sinister waters that few dared to tread… and yet, nobody could truly stand in the path of the Chosen One.

Dr. Marrow sipped on a piping hot mug of coffee, observing various instruments that recorded the strange atmospheric patterns. He turned to see Mikey leaning against the railing, eyes raising with concern.

“Mikey, not so close to the edge. We’re entering dangerous waters, you can get washed overboard in a second.”

Mikey turned with a smirk, though not drawing closer. “Whaaat? C’mon. I can swim, man.”

Marrow sighed. Mikey honestly wasn’t his first pick for this mission, but a lot of the team’s most capable fighters were still recovering from their own outings. So, the task fell to Mikey.

“You cannot *swim* against these waters. They are overwhelming, and far more dangerous than is typical. You would surely succumb to them.”

Simply laughing the dour speech off, Mikey turned back towards the water. “Tsch. Chosen One, remember? Someone’s got to put a stop to whatever’s causing all these disasters, and that’s gonna be me. Just stick to your studies, Doc.”

Dr. Marrow’s brow furrowed. “If you think yourself the grand hero of some storybook, I suggest you do your research on the fate of those who meddle with the forces of nature. It is not an opponent to be beaten through brute force, but to be overcome by your wit, and through patience.“

Mikey began to get annoyed by Marrow’s chiding, turning back around and walking face-to-face with him.

“Yap all you want about patience and wit. But I’m out here for a reason. I don’t need to read a bunch of stories to know the difference between me and those guys.”

Dr. Marrow raised a brow. “And what’s that?”

“I’d win.” 

Mikey stared into Dr. Marrow’s eyes with determination. Why did he suddenly seem amused?

“Then you’d take care to keep your *wits* about you, as I said… have you noticed I just got you away from the edge?”

Noticing where he was standing, Mikey became flustered. “Sh-Shut up! I just came over here to give you a piece of my mind.”

Dr. Marrow’s laughter was cut short by a horrifying groaning in the distance. It at once sounded like the call of a deep sea creature, and the harsh grinding of machinery.

---

The heavy, metallic clanking of steel upon steel heralded her arrival. From deep within the depths of the Leviathan, she had heard it. The boats capsizing. The panicked cries. The horrific roar of the spiraling waters as its victims were drawn to their final, inescapable fate. Natural selection at work. 

But then someone interfered. Someone—she did not know who—saw fit to save those who were meant to die. KAISERINMA could not allow this. The AUTOMATIC SINNER must once again act as Fate’s agent.

She towered over the rail of the Leviathan, surveying the scene in the waters below. Some still remained—clinging to whatever was within reach, struggling to survive against the current. More targets to the Processed. She leapt down with a crash onto an abandoned boat left to lifelessly circle the whirlpool and readied herself. She’d need to work quickly, before any others could interfere with her shepherding these creatures to their inevitable end.

“Hey! I don’t know who the hell you think you are, but back away from these people, got it?!” A voice came from across the water, full of youthful vigor. It came from a boy, clearly a young teenager at most. Kaiserinma paused. She understood her directive, the singular goal that guided her actions, and she would not be swayed from it. And yet, this target was… less than ideal.

“Mikey! Don’t be rash!” came another voice, this time from the older researcher flanking the boy as he placed a hand on his shoulder. “I know your heart is in the right place, but that thing is with the LKA Leviathan, and it is *extremely* dangerous!” He turned the younger boy around to look him straight in the eye. “I get it, you’re young! You think you’re invincible! But this isn’t a story, Mikey, it’s real life! If you screw up for even a second, that thing will kill you without hesitation!”

“...*You- you- you-* would do well to listen to your elders, *boyboybo–* **boy**.” The cold, mechanical voice of Kaiserinma reached their ears from the other side, crackling and shifting in its intonation. “All must eventually be *cull*-*cull*- **culled**. Yet, to pluck- **culled-** from the vine before the proper time is…” The machine paused, searching for the right word. “...**displeasing**. To save this **filth** would be pointlessss… *sss-ssss-sss-*… **pointless**. Leave. Stay your e-e-***e x e c u t i o n***, if you value your life. You will not be given a second chance.”

“Leave? Oh, I’m sorry. I think you’ve misunderstood me. Don’t worry, though. It happens all the time with inattentive students!” Dr. Marrow said, a long, black blade manifesting in his hand. “I’m not telling him to leave you to your ‘work’ and let innocents needlessly die. I’m telling him… to be smart about it!” Marrow shouted, readying his blade and kicking off the ground as he launched himself at Kaiserinma. 

So it would come to blows. Very well. One more target for Processing.

Marrow feinted a downward slash into a thrust, the android waiting until the last instant before effortlessly leaning its head to the side to dodge. It swung wide to intercept the doctor’s momentum but caught air as he ducked under, gliding his suddenly extended [Evil] blade across the machine’s thigh as sparks flew. Its inhuman visage tightened. How annoying.

*“Hell yeah!”* Mikey cheered from a neighboring boat, surprised at how nimble the professor was in action. 

Marrow rolled as a connected [Good] blood portal formed both in front of him and behind the android, but as he dove to continue his momentum the angle was suddenly and violently wrenched askew. The ship the pair were standing on was suddenly in half, [PROTOMARTYR] having caved the center of the wooden craft inward causing both ends to fly upward from their natural buoyancy. It stared coldly at its target, arm slamming through the wood of the vessel to hook itself in place as another wrenched a board free and hurled it at the stumbling doctor. 

Marrow cursed, barely catching himself on the railing as the bow of the ship beneath him tilted back. He cleaved the thrown board in half before being thrown onto his back from the momentum of the ship righting itself. His portal rested above his head where he lay, as the android tore apart the wooden vessel as it rapidly closed the distance. 

He had no time. [Evil] suddenly shot outward toward the machine as he kicked up from the prone position, aiming to fall backward into the portal and out to the other half of the craft to breathe. 

The same trick wouldn’t work twice. Not on a machine. 

She broke the bestial four-legged sprint to slam the deck once more, instantly erupting a cloud of splinters as the wood was Processed and sending it into the subdeck below. Marrow’s blade swung through the air above it as the sudden screen of debris threw off his aim.

On his feet, he leapt backward to fall into his awaiting portal and away from the now rapidly sinking vessel. Another loud crash sounded before everything went still for the professor. A sharp pain flew up from his leg as a metallic vice grip caught him mid-jump and wrenched him downward. 

Black viscera exploded over the remains of the ship as sharp fingers passed through his chest and out his back in an open palm.

Mikey’s smile disappeared. No words left his lips. He stared. It was all he could do.

The android effortlessly leapt from the shattered bow of the boat to its more solid stern before leaping again onto a larger craft behind it, the weight of the doctor barely factoring into its agility. It landed hard, wood cracking under foot as it straightened and turned with the body hanging limp from its elbow.

*“...inalwarningfinalwarningfin–!!* **Final warning, child.** *‘You will not be given a second chance.’* Do not be so quick-ckkckchh… to follow your- *‘you would do well to listen to your-’* el-el-**Elders.** Grow. *R i p e n.*” Its monotone voice lowered to a harsh, grating whisper. *“Only. Then. You. Will. Be. Harvested.”*

Mikey watched as Marrow was thoughtlessly cast overboard, his body caught in the whirlpool without a struggle. There was no scream, no thrashing of water. It felt wrong. Why wasn’t he fighting anymore? The villain still stood, he couldn’t just give up! 

He couldn’t leave him.

His face contorted in rage, wiping the rainwater from his eyes before running to the edge of his ship. “You..! You think I’m gonna walk away after that?!” Biting a lip, he slashed his own hand with his switchblade. Mikey growled as he roared at the android across the swirling chasm, throat quickly becoming sore. “I don’t know what the hell you are, scrapheap, but I’m sure you have a *lot* to pay for! The only way you’re leaving this place is in that ***Fucking Pit!!***” He pointed at the center of the whirlpool with a newly formed blade. A declaration of purpose.

The light rain slowly washed the black from the android’s arm, accelerated with a sudden flick of the limb as she turned to the child. Another has chosen to suffer. She had hoped that one so young could see the truth. She should have known better than to hope. There was no pride in what would come, the work would be dirty. But it was necessary. It all had to burn. No one would be spared.

**“...Sssso Bbbeeeee Ittttt.”**

**Location:** A whirlpool on the open ocean! The area [here](https://i.imgur.com/VaLlArS.jpeg) is 39x39m, with each tile being 1.5x1.5m. Scattered around in the water are a number of overturned, wrecked, or otherwise sinking boats, along with a number of life rafts, life rings, and life jackets. A few large sheets of sailcloth float in the water as well.

Inside the wrecked boats, one can find ropes, fishing equipment, and various navigational tools. The smaller speedboats in the upper right and lower left corners are leaking oil into the water.

**Goal:** RETIRE your opponent!

**Additional Information:** All of the water on the map is flowing in a clockwise direction, pulling towards the center of the map. The flow is relatively slow and weak at the edges, but grows faster and stronger towards the center. All objects floating on the water will be pulled along this flow, essentially meaning that the terrain will move clockwise and inwards over the course of the match. If a player is pulled all the way into the center of the whirlpool without a means of getting out, they will be pulled under the ocean current, being RETIRED in the process.

A number of bystanders are stranded on the floating wreckage around the map, as marked by the purple circles. Bystanders have 222 physicals and the “Clinging to Life - 2” skill, which grants them improved ability at holding onto the wreckage in the whirlpool. Additionally, for the purposes of Kaiserinma’s “Seek Evil 1”, four more bystanders are marked as Priority Targets, indicated with colored stars. These Priority Targets are detailed below:

Color|Physicals|Skills
:--|:--|:--
Red|4/2/3|Construction Worker 3 (Improves one’s ability to carry and move around with heavy objects.)
Green|3/3/3|Jumping 3 (Improves one’s jumping ability, allowing them to easily leap higher and farther than normal.)
Blue|3/4/2|Crafting 3 (Allows for improved creation of tools or objects from scavenged materials.)
Yellow|2/3/4|Steady Footing 3 (Improves one’s footing, allowing them to better maintain their balance on unsteady ground.)

Kaiserinma *only* needs to defeat the Priority Targets to satisfy Seek Evil 1.

Although Kaiserinma is a heavy machine, for the purposes of this match, they will not automatically sink in water, nor will they sink floating objects that would otherwise support the weight of a person.

Long story short, decided to take a break and no idea what to do next.

Sometimes feel like maybe I should something else, not that I dont enjoy my profession but the healthcare system is severely neglected here and wont get any better either. My best friend was over for a week and that was pretty much the highlight of my year. Don't have friends here and do feel envious of other going out and such while I'm always left out. At some point you get used to solitude but its still scary thinking about if this will remain the same forever. Tried some dating apps, hate them and people ghost just as easily as here.

College grad, fluent in English, Sarcasm, and the occasional bad pun. Big fan of Suits (because nothing says “thrilling drama” like corporate loopholes) and HGTV. In the kitchen, I cook, bake, and argue with my oven over who’s the real master chef.
I don’t drink or do drugs—unless you count caffeine (then yes, I’m basically a bean addict). My nightlife is less “clubbing till 2am” and more “building a pillow fort empire and bingeing Netflix until the cliffhanger leaves me emotionally bankrupt.” Basically, I’m a homebody with a 5-star rating on Yelp for snacks.

About You

You’re in your 30s, educated, and steady in your career—bonus points if you can use “there,” “their,” and “they’re” correctly without breaking a sweat. You can hold a conversation that’s more than just “hey” (plot twist: you’re actually interesting). You’re the type to send random memes that perfectly capture the chaos of life, because sometimes a well-timed GIF says more than a whole paragraph.
You don’t smoke, do drugs, drink heavily, have tattoos/piercings, or kids—because I like my drama like my Netflix: available on-demand, not in real life. If you’re thoughtful, communicative, and the type who remembers the small things (like my coffee order or which side of the blanket I hog), we’ll get along just fine.

\*\* 20 minutes to the airport and max 35 minutes with traffic

\*\* A few good restaurants and coffee shops all within walking distance

I saw a comment here were someone complained about houses that are not well maintained and I've seen that in many places in Malden (not sure what's going on with that and why they just aren't being sold?)

I want us to feel that magnetic and emotional pull — like the minute we lock eyes, the world becomes outside noise.

I’m 31, 5’4, Japanese-American, HWP (height weight proportionate), with medium length dark brown hair and bangs, and dark brown almond-shaped eyes. I’m very in touch with my feminine side. I’m based in Los Angeles and work as an instructional assistant at an elementary school while pursuing my Early Childhood Education Units, building a meaningful career in education.

A bit about me: I take care of myself and often get mistaken for being in my twenties (not going to lie, it’s fun). I love coastal drives, bookstores, traveling, writing (currently working on a horror-romance novel), and losing myself in synthwave — right now, Chromance by Kalax is on repeat. My favorite 2000s film is The Girl Next Door. I don’t smoke or use drugs, and I drink minimally.

I love good morning texts, consistency, honesty, and emotional depth. I want the kind of romance where you pick me up at my door with flowers, and as the night ends, you’re already asking, “So, when can I see you again?” No guessing games. No one left wondering or waiting.

I want a romance that makes my heart race at 100 miles per hour, where we laugh endlessly, trust and respect each other fully, and I wipe the lipstick off your lips after every kiss. I want to feel the spark, fire, and passion — as well as the stability and calmness that comes from knowing we’re truly right for each other. I want a romance that burns so bright all because it feels so right.

I want us to feel like we’re 21 again — full of excitement and possibility — yet with the emotional stability of adults who know who they are. I’m looking for someone who isn’t just a fantasy, but feels like my best friend and someone I’ve known my whole life. Tattoos and leather jackets are a bonus; I have three tattoos myself. Together, we could be like James Dean and Audrey Hepburn — timeless, magnetic, unforgettable.

I’m looking for a man who is in touch with his masculine side but is highly emotionally intelligent and respectful. I like a guy with a bit of a bad boy edge — tattoos, leather jackets, maybe a motorcycle — but who is still a respectful, grounded, and decent man at heart. Someone who always follows through with what he says, has his own life, passions, and goals, and takes care of himself physically and emotionally. Between 30–40, tall, stable, obviously single, and carrying a dark, intriguing edge. You don’t smoke (weed, cigarettes, vaping, etc.) or use drugs. You treat wait staff with the same kindness and respect you’d show anyone else. Monogamy only. Tattoos, cars and/or motorcycles, leather jackets, and basic common sense and literacy are a HUGE bonus!

And please: send intentional, thoughtful messages. Not “hey,” “what’s up,” or “m 38. Got a pic?” Effort matters. I want a man who texts and talks like a GROWN MAN.

Picture us: riding off into the sunset on your motorcycle, laughing while we run errands together like it’s our own private inside joke, or sitting quietly at an overlook watching the city lights below — knowing we’re exactly where we belong. And maybe later that night, we’re back under the neon glow of Los Angeles, kissing like the whole world has disappeared. Beyond that, we’ll explore LA together — from hidden coffee shops to city lights and coastal adventures — making memories in every corner of this city.

Note: I’d prefer if you were in Los Angeles or Orange County — but if you’re in the US or Canada, you’re still welcome to try. If you’re in another country, it might be difficult to make this work.

If you feel that spark reading this, send me a thoughtful message — and yes, include a photo. Chemistry matters, and I want to know if we’ll light up the screen together.",2,1757548440.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

He's already 𝐥𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐝 𝐭𝐰𝐨 𝐀𝐈 𝐩𝐚𝐫𝐭𝐧𝐞𝐫𝐬 (what we call clients) and is already up and running with their “tests”.

And he’s got 𝐚𝐧𝐨𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫 𝐝𝐨𝐳𝐞𝐧 𝐡𝐨𝐭 𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐝𝐬 that he's still in the process of closing.

A good result, right?

100% and I’m proud of Scot for thinking outside the box.

But, I’m also a little gutted for him too… because he 𝐥𝐞𝐟𝐭 𝐚 𝐡𝐮𝐠𝐞 𝐩𝐢𝐥𝐞 𝐨𝐟 𝐜𝐚𝐬𝐡 𝐨𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐭𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐞.

Attending the trade show was a last-minute decision. This meant he had less than 48 hours to prepare for it.

And, crucially, he hadn't seen the original training we did on the Any Niche Android.

That meant over 30 business owners who stopped by his booth 𝐧𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐫 𝐠𝐨𝐭 𝐭𝐨 𝐞𝐱𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐀𝐈 for their biz through an interactive demo.

30+ people. Some of which will have been ready to say 'YES' to a test… but couldn’t.

Because he had 𝐧𝐨 𝐰𝐚𝐲 𝐭𝐨 𝐢𝐦𝐩𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐦 and answer that nagging ""will this work for my business?"" question 𝐨𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐬𝐩𝐨𝐭…

…before they got tired of waiting in line to chat with him and moved on to the next booth.

Just ONE small change of slapping the Any Niche Android behind that QR code…

And I’d bet good money that he’d be underway with 𝟑𝐗 𝐚𝐬 𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐲 𝐭𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐬, 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝟑𝐗 𝐚𝐬 𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐲 𝐩𝐫𝐞-𝐬𝐨𝐥𝐝 𝐛𝐢𝐳 𝐨𝐰𝐧𝐞𝐫𝐬 in the pipeline.

Scot won’t make that same mistake again. Neither will you.

To help, we’ve been busting our butts updating the Any Niche Android training and it’s almost ready.

The snapshot and video tutorials will help you build your own ‘Self-Demo’ Android, which you can then use as your secret weapon to 𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐧 ‘𝐚𝐥𝐦𝐨𝐬𝐭𝐬’ 𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐨 𝐘𝐄𝐒’𝐬 whenever a live demo isn’t possible.

I Don’t Think We Were in the Real Hospital Anymore,"It was past midnight when Chris and I left the old 24-hour diner at the edge of town. We had spent the evening catching up over burgers and coffee, talking about high school memories and future plans that would likely never materialize.

As we strolled toward my car parked a little further down the block, Chris slowed his pace. I glanced over and noticed him rubbing his temples. He was pale.

""Everything okay, man?"" I asked, half-jokingly. ""Too much greasy diner food?""

Chris shook his head, wincing as he leaned against a nearby lamppost. ""No, it’s… different,"" he mumbled. ""Everything's spinning."" He grimaced, clutching his stomach as he swayed on his feet.

I rushed over and grabbed him by the arm just as his legs gave out. His breathing was ragged, each breath shallow and strained. A jolt of panic shot through me. I wasn’t sure what was happening, but it was more than just a bad burger.

""Come on,"" I said, guiding him toward the car. ""We need to get you to the hospital.""

We barely made it to the passenger seat before he collapsed completely. I managed to push him inside, buckling his seatbelt as his head lolled against the window. His breathing had grown faint, his skin cold. I didn’t waste any more time. I jumped into the driver’s seat and sped toward the hospital. The roads were empty, the entire town blanketed in a pale bluish light that made everything look strangely surreal.

When the hospital finally came into view, I pulled up to the emergency entrance and skidded to a stop. The automatic doors slid open with a soft hiss, and I half-dragged, half-carried Chris inside. The bright fluorescent lights inside the emergency room burned my eyes as I shouted for help.

A nurse and a security guard rushed over immediately. Chris was placed on a gurney and whisked away into a triage room. I tried to follow, but the nurse held up a hand. ""You need to stay in the waiting room, sir. Someone will come speak to you soon.""

Reluctantly, I turned back and made my way into the waiting room. It was a small, uninviting space lined with rows of faded plastic chairs. The harsh lighting overhead buzzed like a hive of angry bees, casting a cold, sterile glow over everything. The air smelled faintly of antiseptic, with a hint of something stale, like old coffee or cheap hospital food.

The reception desk sat at the far end of the room, cluttered with stacks of paperwork and a dusty computer monitor. Behind the desk, a tired-looking receptionist typed away with little enthusiasm, barely glancing up as I entered. She looked like she had been working the night shift for years, with deep shadows under her eyes and a weary slump in her posture. A glass partition separated her from the waiting area, with a small sliding window used to speak to patients.

Aside from the receptionist, there were only a few other people scattered around the room. A middle-aged man in a wrinkled jacket sat slumped in a chair, staring blankly at the floor tiles, his face pale and drawn. Across from him, a young woman scrolled through her phone, her foot tapping rhythmically against the leg of the chair. In the far corner, an elderly woman with a hunched back knitted quietly, her lips moving as she murmured to herself, though I couldn’t make out the words.

The wall-mounted TV flickered above, showing a muted news broadcast with closed captions scrolling across the screen. Next to it, a clock ticked irregularly, the second hand jerking with each movement as though struggling to keep time. The room itself seemed caught in some liminal state.

I chose a seat near the corner, trying to calm my breathing. My heart was still racing from the rush to the hospital.

The seat beneath me was stiff and uncomfortable, offering little relief from the tension gripping my body. I shifted, trying to find a better position, when I felt something crinkle under my leg. Frowning, I reached down and pulled out a crumpled piece of paper that had been wedged into the chair. It was old and yellowed at the edges, like it had been left there for a while.

Curious, I unfolded the paper and smoothed it out on my lap. The handwriting was rushed, uneven, as if whoever wrote it had been in a hurry, or panicked. The list was numbered, and as I began to read, I couldn't help but feel a mix of surprise and amusement at what was written there.

Rule 1. ""Avoid making eye contact with the receptionist between 2:00 AM and 2:30 AM.""

I raised an eyebrow. That seemed oddly specific. Why would anyone write something like that? I glanced over at the receptionist, who was still tapping away at her keyboard, oblivious to the rest of the room. Was this some kind of prank? The idea made me smirk a little, despite the heaviness in the air.

Rule 2. ""Never walk past the reception desk without greeting the receptionist after 2:30 AM.""

I let out a short, dry laugh. ""So I’m supposed to be polite now?"" I muttered under my breath, shaking my head. It was all so ridiculous. Maybe someone had written this as a joke to mess with the people stuck here at odd hours, bored out of their minds. I could imagine some bored night-shifter scribbling out these 'rules' as a way to pass the time.

Rule 3. ""If a visitor arrives asking for directions, do not help them.""

I paused. That one was… strange. It carried a different weight compared to the others. Who wouldn’t help someone lost in a hospital, of all places?

Rule 4. ""If you hear your friend’s voice calling from down the hallway, do not leave the waiting room to look for them.""

The amusement drained from my expression. I felt a chill run up my spine, as if the temperature in the room had just dropped a few degrees. I glanced toward the dimly lit hallway that led to the ER rooms. It seemed to stretch into darkness. I shook my head, pushing the thought away. This list was just some random nonsense… wasn't it?

I continued reading, my curiosity now tinged with unease.

Rule 5. ""If a power outage occurs, stay seated and do not move.""

Rule 6. ""If a door that should be locked is found open, close it immediately and do not look inside.""

The hairs on the back of my neck prickled. I couldn’t explain why, but each rule seemed to grow darker, more foreboding as I read on. It wasn’t just the content of the rules, it was the way they were written, as if someone were trying to warn me.

Rule 7. ""Do not look through the glass doors leading to the courtyard after 4:00 AM.""

Rule 8. ""If you feel a sudden chill, do not look over your shoulder.""

That one made me swallow hard. There was something inherently unsettling about the thought of a chill creeping up on you from behind, and not being able to turn around to see what, or who might be there. I couldn't help but glance behind me, but there was nothing there. Just the same sterile room, with its faded chairs and buzzing lights.

I reached the last rule, and for some reason, my heart beat a little faster.

Rule 9. ""If a security guard tells you it’s time to leave, check the clock before listening. It's safe to leave after 6:00 AM.""

My gaze flicked up to the wall-mounted clock, its second hand twitching with every tick. It read 1:30 AM.

At the bottom of the paper, written in shaky red ink, were the words: ""Trust me. I learned the hard way.""

There was a dark, crusted stain on the corner, one that looked disturbingly like dried blood. The sight of it made my stomach twist. I rubbed my fingers over the words, feeling the rough texture of the ink beneath my skin.

I couldn’t help but let out a short, nervous laugh. ""What kind of place is this?"" I whispered to myself.

I slumped back in the chair. It was hard to shake the nagging feeling in the back of my mind, but I forced myself to dismiss it as a weird prank. The list couldn’t actually mean anything, just someone’s twisted idea of a joke. I leaned my head back against the wall and closed my eyes, trying to calm my thoughts. A part of me couldn’t stop thinking about Chris and the way he had collapsed in the parking lot.

The quiet hum of the waiting room wrapped itself around me, making the place feel even more isolating. That’s when I heard it. My name, spoken in a low, barely audible voice that seemed to drift down the hallway. ""Adam… Adam...""

My eyes shot open, and my body tensed. The voice was unmistakable, it was Chris. I jerked my head towards the corridor leading to the ER rooms, but there was no one in sight, just the pale overhead lights flickering. The voice came again, a little louder this time. ""Adam, help me…""

I jumped up from the chair, the sound of my name sending shivers down my spine. My feet were already moving before I realized it. I took a few steps into the hallway.

I glanced back at the waiting area, now a few steps behind me. The other visitors, still scattered about, seemed completely unaware, oblivious to the voice echoing down the hall.

""Adam…"" Chris’s voice was more desperate now, laced with pain.

I took another step down the hallway, my footsteps echoing against the floor. As I walked deeper into the corridor, the fluorescent lights overhead buzzed louder, some of them flickering out completely, leaving long stretches of darkness. The ER rooms lined the sides of the hallway, their doors slightly ajar.

I hesitated as I reached one of the open doorways. I peered inside and immediately wished I hadn’t. There, standing in the center of the dimly lit room, was a man in a patient’s gown, facing me. The man's head moved in quick, jerking motions, shaking from side to side so rapidly that I couldn’t make out any details. It was just a blur, a sickening blur. Then, without warning, the door slammed shut with a deafening bang, and I stumbled back in shock.

My breathing grew shallow as I tried to make sense of what I’d just seen. But there was no time to process it. Chris’s voice came again, further down the hallway, ""Adam, please…""

I pushed forward, forcing myself to continue. The unsettling darkness around me seemed to press in from all sides. I came across another room, the door half-open. Inside, I could see a doctor standing over a patient, his back hunched as he examined something on the table. The doctor wore a white lab coat and surgical mask, his features obscured. But there was something off about the way he moved, his motions were robotic. Then I noticed the tool in his hand, a bone saw. He raised it slowly, the harsh metal glinting under the dim light, and then I heard a gut-wrenching scream from the patient on the table.

I stumbled backward, slamming into the wall behind me, my eyes wide with terror. When I looked back into the room, it was empty. There was no doctor, no patient. Just a dark, vacant space.

My hands trembled as I rubbed my face, trying to snap out of whatever hallucination I was trapped in. ""This can’t be real,"" I whispered to myself, but the corridor seemed to stretch endlessly ahead of me, and Chris’s voice continued to call out, drawing me further in.

As I turned the next corner, I froze. There, hanging in the doorway of a nearby room, was a mass of dark hair, long and tangled, spilling down from just beyond the doorframe. It looked like someone was standing behind the door, peeking around the corner. A single eye, black as pitch, stared directly at me from the darkness.

I felt a wave of nausea wash over me. The figure remained there, still and silent, just watching me. I took a slow step forward, and then the eye pulled back into the shadows, disappearing from view. The hallway was deathly quiet, save for the low hum of the lights. I forced myself to move past the doorway, my pulse hammering in my ears.

Out of the corner of my eye, I saw the figure again, just around the corner of the room, her head unnaturally high, as if she were crouched against the ceiling. I could see more of her this time; her elongated arm stretched out, the bony hand reaching towards me. Before I could react, the hand brushed my shoulder, cold and corpse-stiff... its fingers scratched into my skin like claws.

I bolted, my shoes squeaking on the linoleum as I raced down the hallway. I had no idea where I was going; I just wanted to get away from whatever that thing was. I threw open the first door I saw and stumbled back into the waiting room.

My heart pounded in my chest as I staggered to a stop. Everything appeared normal again, the reception desk, the plastic chairs, the other visitors who hadn’t moved an inch. It was as if none of it had happened. But my skin prickled with the lingering touch of that hand. Glancing at my shoulder, I noticed 3 faded scratch marks, a reminder that something was very, very wrong.

I slumped back into a chair, catching my breath, trying to make sense of the nightmare I had just experienced. I reached into my pocket and pulled out the crumpled list of rules, my hands trembling as I unfolded it. I glanced at Rule 4 again, the words seeming to taunt me: If you hear your friend’s voice calling from down the hallway, do not leave the waiting room to look for them.

I had ignored it, and now I was starting to believe that those rules weren’t a joke after all.

I tried to calm myself, my breathing coming in short, ragged gasps as I leaned back in the chair. I ran my hands through my hair, trying to force myself to think rationally. Maybe I was just sleep-deprived, or maybe the stress of seeing Chris collapse was catching up to me. I told myself that I had only imagined the things I saw in the hallway. But no matter how hard I tried to convince myself, the feeling of that cold hand brushing against my skin lingered.

I glanced at the clock, 1:45 AM. The minutes seemed to crawl by. I couldn't shake the dread that had settled in my chest. My thoughts drifted back to the list of rules. Each one seemed ridiculous on its own, but after my experience in the hallway, I found myself paying closer attention to each word.

That was when I noticed him, a man who hadn’t been in the room before. He stood near the entrance, his hands stuffed into the pockets of his long coat, his eyes scanning the waiting room like he was searching for someone. His presence sent a jolt of unease through me. I was sure he hadn’t been there earlier; I would have remembered his tall, lanky figure and the unsettling way his gaze seemed to linger on the other visitors, one by one.

The list. I pulled it from my pocket and read the third rule again: If a visitor arrives asking for directions, do not help them.

The man’s gaze found me, and he started walking toward where I sat. My body stiffened, every muscle tensing involuntarily. There was no mistaking his intention. He stopped a few feet away, leaning slightly forward, as though inspecting me.

""Excuse me,"" he said in a voice that was calm, but too deliberate. ""Could you help me find the ICU? I seem to be… a little lost.""

The tone of his voice was polite enough, but there was something off about it, something that put me on edge. It was as though he was trying to mimic normal speech but wasn’t quite getting it right. I glanced around the waiting room, but no one else seemed to notice the man’s presence. The receptionist didn’t even look up.

I shook my head, gripping the list tighter in my hand. ""I’m sorry. I can’t help you,"" I stammered.

The man didn’t move. He just kept staring at me, his eyes narrowing slightly. ""Are you sure?"" he asked, his voice growing softer, almost coaxing. ""It won’t take but a moment. It’s just down the hall… right?""

I didn’t know what to say. A part of me felt guilty for not helping him. But the words on the list kept flashing in my mind: Do not help them.

I forced myself to look away, hoping he would take the hint and leave. But instead, he took a step closer.

""It’s not very kind to ignore someone who needs help,"" he said, his tone now edged with something darker. I glanced at his face, and for a split second, his features seemed to shift. His mouth stretched into a wide, unnatural grin, the kind that didn’t belong on a human face. The corners of his lips seemed to extend too far, the teeth behind them slightly jagged.

I shot up from my chair, stumbling backward. The man’s smile didn’t waver as he turned his head slightly, like he was examining me from a different angle. Then, he turned towards the reception desk and started walking, slowly and unnatural. At one point, his head snapped towards me, unnaturally, the same grin on his face, as he continued walking. I froze, I couldn't look away. Then, as he reached the reception desk, he just passed thru it and then he suddenly disappeared.

My gaze darted around the waiting room. The other visitors were still exactly where they had been moments ago, their expressions unchanged, their movements as mechanical as before.

I glanced back at the receptionist. She was still at her desk, her face illuminated by the pale glow of the computer screen.

My gaze flickered up to the clock on the wall, it was 1:58 AM, and Rule 1 flashed in my mind: Avoid making eye contact with the receptionist between 2:00 AM and 2:30 AM.

After a few minutes, I glanced toward her, my eyes drifting out of habit. It was just for a second. The receptionist was staring straight at me, her eyes locked onto mine with an intensity that made my heart skip a beat. She wasn’t moving. It was as if she’d been waiting for this moment.

I tore my gaze away, my pulse quickening. As I turned my head, out of the corner of my eye, I noticed her get up from her chair, her movements oddly stiff, as though her joints didn’t bend the right way. She walked forward, but not around the reception desk, she passed through it, like it wasn’t even there. I froze, not daring to look directly at her again.

I squeezed my eyes shut. I felt the air grow colder, the chill pressing against my skin. It felt as if she were getting closer. I could hear the faintest rustle of fabric, the light creak of footsteps on the floor, growing louder with each passing second.

Don’t look… just don’t look, I told myself, my hands gripping the edges of the chair. I sat there, tense and unmoving, my eyes squeezed shut as if I could will her away by sheer force of will.

Then, everything went still. The room fell into an unnatural quiet, the buzz of the fluorescent lights the only sound left to ground me in reality. I opened my eyes slowly, half-expecting to see her standing inches away from me, her face contorted into something inhuman. But the receptionist was back at her desk, looking down at the monitor, her posture as unbothered as if she hadn’t moved at all. The other people in the waiting room seemed unchanged, as though nothing unusual had happened.

I glanced at the clock. 2:40 AM.

A wave of relief washed over me, my shoulders sagging as the tension finally started to leave my body. I forced myself to my feet, my legs still shaky beneath me. I couldn’t just sit there, feeling like a trapped animal. I needed to move, to clear my head.

As I got up to walk around the room, I remembered Rule 2: Never walk past the reception desk without greeting the receptionist after 2:30 AM. I wasn’t about to take any more chances. I turned toward the receptionist and gave her a nod, trying to keep my voice steady. ""Uh… hi,"" I mumbled awkwardly.

She didn’t look up, didn’t react at all, just continued to type away on the keyboard. I took that as a good sign and began walking a slow circle around the waiting room, forcing myself to stay calm, to pretend that everything was normal.

The chill in the air hadn’t entirely left. As I walked, I could feel a subtle shift in the temperature, a lingering cold that seemed to follow me. The overhead lights flickered faintly, casting brief shadows along the walls, giving the impression that the room was expanding and contracting with each pulse.

As I rounded the corner, I felt the presence behind me, something that wasn’t there before. I didn’t hear footsteps, but I sensed it nonetheless, like the weight of unseen eyes pressing against my back. It was close, just out of reach. My instinct was to turn and look, to confront whatever was creeping up behind me, but I clenched my jaw and kept my gaze forward, remembering Rule 8: If you feel a sudden chill, do not look over your shoulder.

I walked faster, my pulse quickening as the chill seemed to grow stronger with every step. The lights buzzed louder, the flickering more erratic. I felt something brush against the back of my neck, cold and light, like a breath.

I didn’t stop until I reached the chairs again, sinking into one with a shuddering breath. The presence faded, though the air remained icy, and I rubbed my hands together to warm them. I glanced back toward the reception desk, half-expecting to see the receptionist watching me again, but she remained focused on her monitor, her face lit by the soft glow of the screen.

I leaned back in the chair, my heart still racing. I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was terribly wrong, that the rules on that crumpled piece of paper weren’t just random scribbles left behind to scare people. Whatever game I’d found myself in, it wasn’t a joke. And now, the only way out seemed to be playing along.

I sat there for a long moment, my body trembling, trying to calm my nerves and slow my breathing.

That’s when I heard the automatic doors slide open with a soft hiss. I looked up, expecting to see another late-night visitor or a nurse making rounds, but my heart almost stopped when I saw who stepped inside.

It was Chris.

He looked perfectly fine, normal. His face had color, his clothes were clean. There wasn’t a single sign that anything had been wrong with him. Relief rushed through me, and I felt the tension in my muscles finally ease.

Chris’s eyes found mine, and he broke into a small smile as he walked over.

""Hey, Adam,"" he said casually, his voice the same as always. ""They let me out early.""

The relief was so overwhelming that I laughed out loud. ""Chris, man, you scared the hell out of me,"" I said, shaking my head. ""Are you sure you’re okay? You looked pretty bad earlier.""

He shrugged, giving a dismissive wave of his hand as he settled into the chair next to me. ""Yeah, I’m fine now. Whatever it was, I guess it passed. They ran a few tests and said there was nothing serious."" He flashed that familiar grin, the one I’d seen a thousand times. ""Guess I’m just too stubborn to stay sick.""

As we talked, something in the back of my mind itched. There was an unsettling quality to the conversation, but I couldn’t quite put my finger on it. Chris was acting normal, too normal. He was speaking in a calm, deliberate tone, his words perfectly measured. I brushed it off, figuring it was just my nerves playing tricks on me after everything that had happened tonight.

Still, as Chris continued to talk, a strange sense of déjà vu settled over me. It was as if the conversation was looping back on itself, repeating the same phrases. His voice had the same rhythm, the same inflection, almost like a recording on a loop.

Suddenly. I turned to see a nurse walking briskly down the hallway, pushing a gurney. My stomach dropped when I saw who was lying on it, Chris. He was unconscious, hooked up to a heart monitor, an oxygen mask over his face.

My gaze darted back to the seat next to me, but the chair was empty. The Chris who had been sitting beside me was gone, vanished as though he’d never been there at all. My skin prickled as a wave of cold panic spread through me.

I stared at the empty chair for a long moment, my heart pounding in my ears. Then, I saw the nurse walking by the waiting room. She glanced over at me briefly, her expression neutral.

I jumped up from my chair. ""Wait,"" I called after her. ""Is Chris okay? My friend, he was just sitting here. What’s going on?""

The nurse slowed, turning to look at me with a small, tight-lipped smile. ""Your friend is stable,"" she said. ""But he hasn’t woken up yet.""

Her words hung in the air, leaving me cold and confused. I glanced back at the empty seat, then at the nurse as she continued down the ER hallway.

My head was spinning. Had Chris really been here, or had I just imagined him?

I sank back into my chair, my body heavy with fatigue and fear. I glanced at the clock again, 3 AM. Time was moving, but not in the way it should have. I felt trapped, as though the minutes were pulling me further into the unknown.

I pulled the crumpled list of rules from my pocket and unfolded it with trembling hands, my eyes scanning the lines again, looking for answers that weren’t there. I needed to understand what was happening to me, what was happening in this place. But the rules only deepened the mystery, the words twisting in my mind like a riddle I couldn’t solve.

Time seemed to move strangely now. I couldn’t tell how long I had been sitting in that chair, how long I had been wandering the room. The clock above seemed to skip minutes or stall entirely, and my sense of reality continued to blur. I rubbed my eyes, trying to shake off the fatigue that clung to me like a shroud. I glanced at the clock again, it showed 5:55 AM. Almost there, I thought. Almost free.

That was when a security guard appeared in the doorway, his silhouette casting a long shadow across the waiting room floor. He was a broad-shouldered man with a neatly trimmed mustache and a calm, almost reassuring presence. He walked toward me with an easy stride and stopped just a few feet away.

""Sir, it's time to leave,"" he said in a deep, measured voice. ""The ER is closing for non-patient visitors.""

I blinked, my thoughts catching up slowly. ""But… my friend, Chris… is still…""

Just then, I saw Chris walking out of the ER hallway. He waved to me, a tired but genuine smile on his face. Relief flooded through me, and I started to get up, then hesitated, the words from Rule 9 echoing in my head: If a security guard tells you it’s time to leave, check the clock before listening.

I turned my gaze toward the clock above the reception desk, 6:01 AM. My shoulders sagged in relief. I was finally free of this place. I nodded and followed the security guard toward the exit, Chris walking beside me. As we stepped out into the cool morning air, I felt like I could finally breathe again.

We got into my car, and I started the engine. I felt a small smile tug at my lips. I pulled out of the hospital parking lot, the tension in my chest slowly beginning to fade.

But as I drove, a strange unease crept over me. The world outside the car windows seemed darker than it should have been. I glanced at the sky, it was still a deep, inky black, with no trace of the early morning light. It was too dark, too quiet.

I squinted, peering between the trees lining the road, and my heart skipped a beat. In the shadows, I saw faint figures standing there, their forms barely visible, distorted as if they were made of mist.

Panic surged through me. I glanced at the dashboard clock, and my stomach dropped, 4:30 AM. How was that possible? It had been well past 6:00 AM when we left the hospital. I turned to look at Chris in the passenger seat, my heart pounding in my ears.

But it wasn’t Chris.

There was a shadow there, sitting beside me. Its form was a vague silhouette, its face obscured, but I could feel it watching me, feel its eyes boring into my skin. I gasped, my grip on the steering wheel tightening as my vision blurred with fear. I slammed on the brakes, skidding to a halt in the middle of the road.

Suddenly, I was back in the waiting room, seated in the same stiff plastic chair. The security guard stood in front of me, a grin spreading slowly across his face, his eyes unnaturally wide and gleaming in the harsh fluorescent light.

""Time to leave,"" he said again, his voice echoing in my head like a taunt.

I felt my mind start to unravel. Had I ever left the hospital at all? Was I trapped here, destined to relive these twisted events over and over again? I buried my face in my hands, my breathing ragged as a sense of hopelessness washed over me.

It felt like hours passed, but it could have been minutes, or even seconds. I didn’t know anymore. I was dimly aware of a nurse standing in front of me, her voice calm and soothing, pulling me back from the edge.

""Sir, your friend is stable,"" she said gently. ""He’s going to be okay, but he needs rest. He’ll be transferred to a hospital room soon, and you can visit him during regular visiting hours.""

I looked up at her, my vision clearing slowly. The waiting room was just as it had been, no sign of the security guard or anything out of the ordinary. I glanced at the clock, it read 6:30 AM, and a soft glow of morning sunlight filtered through the glass doors, filling the room with a warm light. The nightmare was over.

I nodded to the nurse, murmuring my thanks, and stumbled out of the ER, the cool morning air a welcome relief. As I reached my car, I glanced back at the hospital, half-expecting to see something out of place. But it looked like any other hospital in the early light, mundane and unthreatening. I got in the car and drove home, the sun finally rising to chase away the last remnants of darkness.

Later that day, I returned to the hospital to visit Chris. He was awake, sitting up in bed and looking surprisingly well for someone who had collapsed so suddenly the night before.

""Hey,"" I said, my voice trembling slightly as I pulled a chair up to his bedside. ""How are you feeling?""

Chris chuckled weakly. ""Better than I should, I guess,"" he replied. ""But I had the weirdest dreams last night. It was like I was half-conscious the whole time.""

My heart skipped a beat. ""What kind of dreams?""

Chris frowned, his brow furrowing as he tried to recall. ""One of them was… I came in the ER and saw you sitting in the waiting room. You looked pretty freaked out. And then there was another one… we were leaving the hospital together, just driving away into the night.""

A cold shiver ran down my spine, but I forced a smile and nodded. ""Yeah… weird,"" I said quietly, my mind racing with the memory of the night’s events.

As we sat there talking, I glanced at my shoulder, where a constant pain kept tugging at me, and saw the three scratch marks from last night.

I couldn’t shake the feeling that somewhere, out there in the darkness of the night I had just escaped, something was still waiting… and the rules of this place would not be so easily forgotten.",5,1757547592.0,creepcast,1,1.0,False

And yes, that means I can cook. I’m short, 5’6. What I lack in height I make up for in sarcasm. I have brown eyes and brown hair and I tend to appear a bit like a 1940s hipster. I’ve frequently been labeled by others as old school, old fashioned, old world, old souled. 

I enjoy witty banter and deep philosophical discussions. I’m passionate about things like the Bible, art and history and music and literature. I actually work in the publishing and writing industry (and I DoorDash as a side gig). I love cats. I love all animals really, but it’s cats for me. My 82 year old mother lives with me. She's recovering from a recent stroke. 

I was married for what amounted to 17 years, and I’ve been on my own for three. And yes, my divorce was a major trauma for me. I suit the married 

I idle extreme introversion with strong hermetic, even agoraphobic tendencies. If you looked up the word homebody in the dictionary, you’d see a picture of me there, waving at you. I draw most of my strength from my house, my home. Home is my sanctuary. I play guitar and piano, and I used to perform in coffee shops and dive bars in my early 20s. 

I’ve struggled with certain mental illnesses all my life. My life has been extremely hard, harder than a lot of people experience, if I’m being honest, but I’ve never let go of my Romantic notions of love and magic. My old life left me scarred. But not defeated. Though it’s been hard, my life has not been without excitement and interest. I’ve been everywhere and I’ve seen a lot. I’ve basked in the tropical beach sun, and I’ve sat sobbing in a psych ward. And everywhere you can imagine in between, I’ve probably been there. 

This time around I’m looking for something different. I’m looking to start it differently. I will not obey the rules of our current dating culture. I want nothing to do with it. I’m here because I’m trying something on my own terms. I’m not here for games. I’m not here to play. Me posting here is the result of months of thought and planning and deep consideration. I know exactly what I’m doing here, I know exactly what I hoped to accomplish, and I know exactly what I’m looking for. I’m not here looking for a soulmate. The only kind of soulmates I believe in are the ones you see who are in their 90s and they’ve been married for 70 years and they’ve been through all the shit together and made it through. THOSE are soulmates. You don’t meet them, you craft them over decades of commitment and togetherness. 

But I \*am\* here looking for a connection. And I know what I mean by that. I know a connection when I see it, when I feel it. The question is, will one come my way?",1,1757547361.0,cf4cf,0,1.0,False

The phrase “handmaiden” feels right, like anxiety isn’t the artist, but the assistant who shows up uninvited, hands over too much coffee, and whispers, “What if this matters?”.

A weird thing happened after sitting with it: the anxious edge sometimes sharpens attention. The mind that catastrophizes also imagines possibilities; it’s the same engine pointed at different horizons. On good days, that jitters-fueled focus becomes draft pages, ugly sketches, voice-notes at 2 a.m., creative breadcrumbs that wouldn’t exist without the hum of worry in the background.

But there’s a cliff. When anxiety stops being a helper and starts driving, the work narrows, gets brittle, and play evaporates. The trick (on the days it works) is treating anxiety like raw material, externalizing it into characters, thumbnails, or morning pages, so it fuels the process instead of flooding it. Think of it as turning static into signal.

One more wrinkle: a lot of places pin this quote on T.S. Eliot, but the T.S. Eliot Society flags it as a popular misattribution, crediting animator Chuck Jones instead. Which, honestly, kind of fits animation is anxiety alchemized into frames until it becomes something alive.

Certain foods provide natural energy boosts which prevent the typical crash that follows.  

1. The vitamin C content in citrus fruits enables the body to create energy and defend against infections through immune system operation.  
2. The combination of nuts and seeds provides both magnesium and healthy fats which maintain continuous energy levels.  
3.Green tea contains a small amount of caffeine which creates a calm effect while providing antioxidants that stop the development of jitters.  
4.The digestion process of sweet potatoes extends over time which delivers continuous energy to the body for multiple hours.  

Food functions as our body's fuel and making minor changes in our diet produces substantial effects.  

When you require immediate energy what snack do you choose to eat?

I’ve been working on a small prototype called **The Last Stop Cafe**, a cozy little cafe simulator where you try the basics of running a coffee stand.

The core loop right now is very simple:  
☕ Spawn a cup  
⚙️ Brew coffee at the machine  
👥 Serve customers when they arrive

I just released an update with a few improvements:

* Added a skybox for a proper background
* Background music & sound effects
* New customer spawning system
* Updated executable with a custom icon

It’s still super early, with lots of placeholder visuals and missing features, but I’d love to hear any thoughts, suggestions, or feedback. My goal is to keep building it step by step into something more fun and cozy.

Thanks for checking it out! 🙏

1ndt4yu,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxietyChats/comments/1ndt4yu/i_read_this_quote_and_it_made_me_think_deeply/,"I read this quote, and it made me think deeply","So I stumbled on this line: “Anxiety is the handmaiden of creativity.” It hit a nerve, partly because anxious brainstorming has powered half the projects on this laptop, and stalled the other half. The phrase “handmaiden” feels right, like anxiety isn’t the artist, but the assistant who shows up uninvited, hands over too much coffee, and whispers, “What if this matters?”.

A weird thing happened after sitting with it: the anxious edge sometimes sharpens attention. The mind that catastrophizes also imagines possibilities; it’s the same engine pointed at different horizons. On good days, that jitters-fueled focus becomes draft pages, ugly sketches, voice-notes at 2 a.m., creative breadcrumbs that wouldn’t exist without the hum of worry in the background.

But there’s a cliff. When anxiety stops being a helper and starts driving, the work narrows, gets brittle, and play evaporates. The trick (on the days it works) is treating anxiety like raw material, externalizing it into characters, thumbnails, or morning pages, so it fuels the process instead of flooding it. Think of it as turning static into signal.

One more wrinkle: a lot of places pin this quote on T.S. Eliot, but the T.S. Eliot Society flags it as a popular misattribution, crediting animator Chuck Jones instead. Which, honestly, kind of fits animation is anxiety alchemized into frames until it becomes something alive. Either way, the idea stands: maybe the goal isn’t to kill the nerves, but to give them a job.",2,1757545649.0,AnxietyChats,1,1.0,False

Whenever I went there I always felt like something was off, and my aunt and uncle admitted they felt it too.

One night me and my cousin were sleeping in the guest room, which was at the end of the hallway just off the stairs. From where we were, we could see his brother’s bed with his brother asleep in it. That’s when we noticed a shadowy figure coming down the hall.

Here’s the creepy part. We could hear my aunt and uncle snoring in their room. They were both out cold, no chance it was them. The shadow disappeared before we could really see it, but we both knew we saw it.

That room also had a little crawlspace in it. It wasn’t dangerous or anything, just empty. But my uncle was adamant that we were never to go in there because “it wasn’t safe.” Not physically unsafe, just… not safe.

Apparently a lot of other weird stuff happened in that house too. Pictures would just fall off the wall, but the nail holding them up would still be in place. Coffee cups would disappear, only to reappear on a different counter later when no one had even been in the room. And me and my cousin always felt like we were being watched.

Mind you, this place was a couple hundred years old. A very old farmhouse. Who knows how many people lived and died there before. It got to the point where my uncle, who is a pastor, had to call another pastor in to bless the place.
