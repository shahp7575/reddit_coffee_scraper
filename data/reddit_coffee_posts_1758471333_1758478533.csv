I’m in Charleston, SC and looking to connect with people who are also into business and finance. I just feel like Im alone everyone around me doesn’t have the same mindset as me. Not really looking for a formal business partner, just folks to share ideas with, have good money/entrepreneurship conversations, and maybe collaborate if it makes sense.

I’m not asking for a handout, I’ve got my own resources and experience, but I know building relationships with like-minded people can open doors and spark better ideas.

I moved to London at the beginning of this year and have been enjoying my days a lot (apart from the days in winter when it was dark by 3 pm...). I'm from Canada and decided to move here to fight my inner demons (Read: I wanted a change of pace and experience European culture).

I want to meet a girl to go to museums with, to visit Christmas markets with, to have coffee and talk deep topics on the balcony at 10 pm with, to go on weekend trips to Italy and see Roman statues and have authentic pizza with, but most of all, someone who simply enjoys my company as much I enjoy theirs.

About myself, I'm 26, Asian, 6 feet, and ever since I moved here, I've been doing a hella more cooking so I'm sure I can whip up a feast for you when you visit! I play games a lot on my PC, and my most played recently is Dead by Daylight, it's the only game where you can see characters from Silent Hill, Resident Evil, Halloween, and Alien all work together to repair some scuffed generators.

I've been playing Silksong and suffering from the bosses like everyone else, but I think it proves that I'm into masochism :) I started bouldering recently and I think the climbing process is quite like how I have to climb Mount Fey in Silksong, so I basically imagine that I'm the MC in the climbing gym even if I'm climbing the most basic courses.

I hope you can join me in this season of falling leaves and be the petal right beside me!",1,1758478246.0,r4r,1,1.0,True
1nmz47v,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1nmz47v/its_hard_to_get_lost_if_you_dont_know_where_youre/,It’s hard to get lost if you don’t know where you’re going: Looking back at Jim Jarmusch.,"For 45 years, Jim Jarmusch has remained independent of the Hollywood system. Making art films, genre films, anthology films, and documentaries. His stories are laid back and cool. Thoughtful and artistic. Reflective and emotive. They have a deadpan style and a sharp wit. The movies look at various types of people in different walks of life.

His films are never locked down to one location or city. I always considered Jarmusch a New York city director. He is based out of New York, but he’ is not from there, and his films are very rarely set there. Some of them aren’t even set in America. He has built up a strong list of collaborators, and It always a delight when you see their names in the credits.

I discovered his movies when I was 12 or 13 when Dead Man was released on video. This was at a time when I was in love with Westerns, and I remember finding the weirdness a turn-off. It was definitely a memorable movie. I was just too young to really understand or connect to it. A couple of years later, when I found Down by Law and Night on Earth in a video store. I really fell in love with his movies and his style.

He has a new movie out later this year. I took a look back at his filmography from his very beginnings of beatnik prose style art fil to his most recent all-star cast horror comedy.

**Permanent Vacation (1980)** ***\*\* Okay***

***“Well, I have my dreams while I'm awake.”***

Jim Jarmusch creates a sense of curiosity with his debut semi-student feature, Permanent Vacation. Allie Parker rambles through New York City streets, discovering a surrealist landscape of idiosyncratic personalities. This film is short, slow, and uneventful.

Jarmusch is showing a minimalist approach to just about everything in the movie. He is not trying to impress you visually. The characters don’t seem interested in coexisting. The filming locations are wherever they could go and film. But the director manages to make it fit together somehow and get to an ending. One where I also want to escape the movie alongside Allie as he leaves New York behind.

The film doesn’t always have a point, but I feel Jarmusch was successful with making what he wanted to express. Whatever that may have been. Leave the world behind, maybe? His future style is all very apparent in the tone, the dialogue, and the characters. It’s great to see John Lurie and a young Frankie Faison who add extra texture to the world. Permanent Vacation’s ending doesn’t make up for the slow nature and aimlessness of the narrative.

**Stranger Than Paradise (1984)** ***\*\*\*\* Great***

***“You know, it's funny... you come to someplace new, an'... and everything looks just the same.”***

Jarmusch returns with a structured narrative and a definite clearer intent. The story is lite and simple. Willie spends his days in his New York apartment. His Hungarian cousin Eva comes to stay for a few days. Willie is cold to Eva but learns to appreciate her over a short time. One year later, after hustling a decent jackpot, Willie and his gambling buddy Eddie plan a road trip to visit Eva in Cleveland and continue their journey to Florida.

The minimalist nature of the director’s style from his previous movie remains and this time in black and white. Looking at this, Permanent Vacation feels like it is completely improvised by comparison. Stranger Than Paradise is filmed in a series of master shots and relies on a good sense of blocking and performance. Jarmusch shows significant improvement in directing and telling a story he wants to tell. John Lurie, Richard Edson,  and Eszter Balint all deliver natural performances, and their characters show little quirks as they bounce dialogue off one another. The music sets the vibe, and Screamin’ Jay is my main man!

Stranger Than Paradise shows a director who has figured out his deadpan style. It’s a small movie that doesn’t have a lot to say and relishes a quiet moment. With a funny sense of irony, the film makes waves with little splashes of humour here and there. It’s never boring even with very little happening.

**Down by Law (1986)** ***\*\*\*\*\* Masterpiece***

***“You always makin' big plans for tomorrow. You know why? Because you always fuckin' up today.”***

Down by Law is a movie about finding friendship in unusual circumstances. A simple plot about three characters, Zack a radio DJ, Jack a pimp, and Roberto an Italian tourist, who all end up in prison together and they get to know each other. The film is killing time as you hang around with the three inmates.

The setting of the movie is New Orleans. Before we get sent to prison, the movie spends enough time on the streets to set a vibe that is ominous. The city feels deserted like it is closing in on Zack and Jack. Once we arrive in our cell and all three leads are together on screen, the humour of their situation kicks in. With an increased budget 4 times as big as the previous movie, the filmmakers can afford things like editing, actors, and interesting locations. John Lurie as Jack brings the same energy as before, with Tom Waits as Zack, who brings his own charm. But it is Roberto Benigni who steals the show and really brings life and comedy into the noir-ish world the rest of the characters exist in.

Jarmusch continues to improve his style and proves again he can create an interesting story and characters. Bringing together a cast with an amusing chemistry and a three-way dynamic that strengthens the movie. The film doesn’t waste your time, and once it brings you to a fork in the road, it leaves you alone to watch the story splinter apart and continue elsewhere.

**Mystery Train (1989)** ***\*\*\*\* Great***

***“Danger! Danger! Will Robinson! Will Robinson! - Danger! Danger!”***

An anthology comedy tells three stories in the city of Memphis, Tennessee. Each story takes place concurrently on the same day and night, with the central characters arriving at the same hotel to wait out the night. The hotel is managed by Sreamin’ Jay Hawkins and Clinque Lee, who witness the characters come and go.

Jun and Mitzuko, played by Masatoshi Nagase and Yuki Kudo, respectively, are two Japanese tourists and a pleasant introduction to Mystery Train. Their rockabilly eagerness to see the home of Elvis and their discussions about American culture has a delightful charm and warm eccentricity. Luisa, played by Nicoletta Braschi, an Italian widow stranded while in the process of returning her dead husband to Italy. A fish out of water as she encounters locals and hears stories about ghost Elvis. Johnny, played by Joe Strummer, has lost his job, his girlfriend, and is about to completely fall apart. When Johnny commits a crime, he hides out with his friend Will Robinson and his “brother-in-law” Charlie, as they each get Lost in Space.

Robert Muller returns as director of photography and switches to colour after the stark B&Ws of Down by Law. With Jarmusch, they create a lively world. The characters are mostly outsiders drifting through the story of Memphis rather than being about any aspect of the cities culture. The audience is as much of an outsider in Memphis as the characters in the movie. Steve Buschemi, Elizabeth Bracco, Tom Noonan, Rick Aviles, and the voice of Tom Waits round out the cast and bring Jarmusch’s version of Memphis alive. Screamin’ Jay is still my main man!

**Night on Earth (1991)** ***\*\*\*\*\* Masterpiece***

***“I don't know if you ever made love with your sister-in-law, Father, but you should try it, because it's absolute heaven.”***

Five taxicabs in five different cities across North America and Europe during one night. Strangers discuss their lives and their dreams and connect for a few brief moments. Some of these include interactions of respect, friendship, conflict, absurdity, and sadness.

Night on Earth jumps around the northern hemisphere. Each segment spends enough time in each city for the audience to get to know the drivers and passengers just enough to understand their characters. Even though most of the movie takes place in cars, it never feels claustrophobic and actually feels very cosy at times. Frederick Elmes does a great job with the photography and sets a varied atmosphere between each car. The interludes between segments are a clever touch to establish the locations and the time of day.

This movie is best enjoyed by just sitting back and letting these drivers take you around their home towns. A stellar ensemble with Winona Ryder, Gena Rowlands, Giancarlo Esposito, Armin Mueller-Stahl, Isaac De Bankole, and Roberto Benigni.

**Dead Man (1995)** ***\*\*\*\*\* Masterpiece***

***“If the doors of perception were cleansed, everything would appear to man as it is: infinite.”***

This feels like Jarmusch’s most distinct and accomplished piece of work so far. Nebbish accountant William Blake traverses a series of psychedelic encounters across the American West. After murdering a potential employer’s son and mistaken for a dead poet, Nobody helps guide Blake to find another life for himself filled with violence and discovery along their journey.

With his largest budget yet, Jim Jarmusch tells a surreal story of death, loss, rebirth, enlightenment, and how everything crosses over in between. But the script is also extremely funny, with Jarmusch giving a lot of characters snappy dialogue. Gary Farmer steals the show. Many fun cameos like Gabrial Byrne, Billy Bob Thornton, Crispin Glover, and in one of his final film performances, Robert Mitchum.

Robby Muller takes advantage of returning to B&W, capturing the industrial modernity of the late 19^(th) century in the beginning and the scenic wilderness of the wild west as the story spreads out. The amazing score is performed by Neil Young on electric guitar, adding a wonderful erratic tonal atmosphere. Everything from the costumes to the props is effective at making the world feel lived in.

Dead Man has many references to westerns and familiar tropes of the western genre. The minimalist style of Jim Jarmusch adds a sense of realism to the setting and period. The characters are calm, and the story moves slowly. It is a spiritual journey to the next life disguised as a chase movie.

**Year of the Horse (1997)** ***\*\* Okay***

***“Crank it up.”***

A documentary and concert film on Neil Young and Crazy Horse. The film primarily focuses on their 1996 tour. The documentary exists to spread appreciation of Neil Young and Crazy Horse to fellow Neil Young and Crazy Horse fans. There is also behind the scenes footage from 30 years of previous tours showing arguments and fun times. In present-day interviews, they reminisce like a big family as they travel the world together.

The doc is shot on Super 8, with additional footage on 16mm, and Hi-8 video. I watched it on DVD. It mostly looks like shite, but the music sounds great. It’s not trying to be classy like The Last Waltz or flashy like Stop Making Sense. There is some interesting stories here, and the music performances are great. But if you’re not a big fan of Neil Young or Jim Jarmusch, then this might not be worth your time, but it is a decent movie.

**Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai (1999)** ***\*\*\*\*\* Masterpiece***

***“JESUS, IT'S THE FUCKING BIRD MAN!”***

A timid hitman by the name of Ghost Dog spends his time wanting to understand violence and caring for his pigeons. Ghost Dog believes in the code of the samurai and seeks guidance from the Hagakure. He weaves in and out of the city streets and observes the way of the samurai in everyday life. After he successfully fulfils a professional contract on a crime boss, the mafia want him gone despite it being them that ordered the hit.

Jarmusch is mixing genres and ideas from a number of artistic sources and creating a vivid world. Taking inspiration from Melville’s Le Samourai and Kurosawa’s Rashomon, adding philosophy, mixed with hip-hop culture, caught up in an Italian crime drama. The film is written with funny characters and dialogue layered around a stoic character who muses internally the way of the samurai. Ghost Dog’s best friend is a French Ice-Cream man who doesn’t speak English, but they communicate effectively and successfully. A recuring motif throughout the movie is using TV animation to reflect the story and the absurdity of the situations the characters find themselves in.

The film features a cool hip-hop soundtrack and score produced by Wu-Tang clan’s RZA, who also features very briefly in the movie. Forest Whitaker is cool and contemplative. Outside of the narration, he says very little. His performance shines in his facial expressions. Henry Silva, Isaach De Banokle, and Victor Argo are among the supporting cast.  

**Coffee and Cigarettes (2003)** ***\*\*\* Good***

***“The beauty of quitting is, now that I've quit, I can have one, 'cause I've quit.”***

Coffee and Cigarettes originally began as a short film. Then, a trilogy of short films. Then, eventually becoming a feature anthology film with a variety of vignettes. Each segment follows a simple formula, the characters sit at a table and over coffee and cigarettes while they have conversations like they’re in a Beckett play.

For the most part, the performers are playing themselves or at the very least going by their given names. There’s a variety of parings and topics discussed. Iggy Pop and Tom Waits discuss quitting smoking. Cate Blanchett meets a cousin also played by Cate Blanchett and discuss their personal lives. Jack and Meg White discuss Jack’s tesla coil. RZA, GZA, and Bill Murray argue over caffeine delirium. These are just a few of the stories presented.

Jim Jarmusch is setting a mood. There’s no plot, and the movie isn’t really about anything aside from the usual connections we all make in everyday life. There are some stand-out scenes and wonderful performances. It’s funny and entertaining. It’s a nice little movie.

**Broken Flowers (2005)** ***\*\*\*\*\* Excellent***

***“So how's the sweetest grape on the vine?”***

Bill Murray is Don Johnston, a worn down retiree, content to enjoy his days watching movies and listening to music. The same day his girlfriend leaves him, he receives an anonymous letter claiming to be from an old girlfriend who gave birth to his son 19 years earlier. With the help of an inquisitive neighbour who is an amateur mystery writer, Don hits the road to look up a number of ex-girlfriends and find who sent the letter.

After a number of critical successes in the independent cinema scene of the 80s and 90s, Jim Jarmusch makes a film that feels a little more mainstream but is still on the outside A romantic comedy, without the romance. The story is framed like an episodic road movie as Don travels from town to town, ex-girlfriend to ex-girlfriend. Some minor details stick out with each destination that tie them to the letter and, at the same time, complicate the mystery. Jarmusch shows he still wants to tell stories that he finds interesting.

Each of the girlfriends, Julie Delpy. Sharon Stone, Francis Conroy, Jessica Lange, and Tilda Swinton add something different to each character for their limited screentime. Murray and Jarmusch together are a good combination of deadpan humour. Broken Flowers came two years after Lost in Translation and is riding the wave of Murray redefining himself as a mature and dramatic, but still funny actor.

Broken flowers follows a simple plot complicated by bigger questions. The mystery is just part of a bigger mystery. The film is focused on ideas of getting older, reaching a crossroads, and questioning old choices. Do I even know the person I have been my whole life? Would I recognise a long-lost son on the street if I saw him for the first time?

**The Limits of Control (2009)** ***\*\*\* Good***

***“He who thinks he's bigger than the rest must go to the cemetery. There he will see what life really is... a handful of dust.”***

The second film in Jarmusch’s filmography to focus on a hitman. The Limits of Control features a character known only as the Lone Man who gathers cryptic information from strangers about his next target. He enjoys the culture that the cities of Madrid and Seville have to offer, resists the advances of a bare skinned femme fatale, and exchanges matchboxes and dialogue to get him where he needs to be to kill a man.

The film is slowly paced following Isaach de Bankole’s Lone Man as he walks the city streets,  enjoys espressos in the cafes, visits museums, or sees a show. It’s very methodical with how he acts as a tourist to the point that it plays like nothing is happening. There’s no specific reason given how the procedures of the rendezvous’ with strangers connect the dots. They just happen, and presumably, the Lone Man has the information he needed. The movie looks beautiful with Christopher Doyle framing wonderful compositions of colour and old city streets. The lead performance is monotone, which might be a tur- off for the audience. De Bankole plays the lone man focused and unemotional, but always cool and attentive.

There are some comparisons to Ghost Dog to be made. The lead actor appears in both movies, and both lead characters are quiet hitmen, drawing influence from Melville’s Le Samourai. The constant walking through empty streets. Communication through language barriers with enough effective understanding. The museum art pieces and music show reflect the narrative in a similar way cartoons did in Ghost Dog. But we don’t have the hip-hop soundtrack and score from RZA. And we don’t have an inner monologue detailing the Lone Man’s thoughts. It’s hard to really know how he feels about anything.

There’s very little reason to be invested in the story, and the film isn’t relaying a lot of important information you would normally expect. It wants you to use your imagination to fill in the gaps of all the whos and whys with whatever answer suits you. Jarmusch just wants you to hang with the Lone Man and the supporting cast of cameos featuring John Hurt, Tilda Swinton, Gael Garcia Bernal, and Bill Murray. A little muddled, slow, and devoid of character but generally a well-made and well-structured minimalist screenplay that lands a little short of the mark.

**Only Lovers Left Alive (2013)**  ***\*\*\*\* Great***

***“I just feel like all the sand is at the bottom of the hour glass or something.”***

Adam, an immortal Rock N’ Roll star, lives out his days in reclusion in the city of Detroit.  A music obsessed vampire, forever depressed in an addiction he can’t escape. Adam uses his time to make music and connect to his humanity. His lover Eve returns after an extended break, and together, they question the value of life, show appreciation for art and technology, and reignite their love for one another. The arrival of Eve’s sister Ava draws Adam back out into the world to face the music.

The script plays around with Vampire Lore a little. Nothing groundbreaking, but it isn’t interested in telling a monster story. Human blood has become too contaminated to drink fresh. The characters must source blood from private doners or blood banks. Drinking blood is like heroin, an instant high that looks euphoric, pleasurable, and rejuvenating. This time, collaborating with cinematographer Yorick Le Saux, he and Jarmusch create a visually modern gothic look filled with dark reds and deep blues. The empty streets of Detroit make the city as undead as Adam and Eve. The music has soft themes that fit the mood and the performances of the actors.

Tom Hiddleston and Tilda Swinton as Adam and Eve are good together, matching each other’s stoicism with romantic tenderness. Intertwined like the yin yang, Swinton dressed in all white with white hair and Hiddleston her reverse image all in black clothes and long black hair. Adam is the most interesting of the two. Somewhat of a contradiction to himself, he appears obsessed with technology but only up to a point and can’t bring himself to step outside of the analogue era. He hates mankind referring to people as zombies, but he loves the art, the music, and the creations of mankind. Mia Wasikowska, Anton Yelchin, Jeffrey Wright, and John Hurt also appear and are given little character moments to shine. Jeffrey Wright especially brings some levity to a nothing part and makes himself interesting.

The mood of the picture is contemplative and contradictory. These characters are bored of living and need to kill to survive but compassionate about life and art. It spends time with the characters as they discuss the beauty and the horrors of the world. It’s a very good movie about getting old, letting go, and accepting who you are.

**Paterson (2016)** ***\*\*\*\* Great***

***“Sometimes an empty page presents more possibilities”***

In Paterson, New Jersey, a local bus driver named Paterson observes the world around him and engages in writing poetry. Each monotonous day passes as his routine stays the same. He begins with writing his poetry. He overhears the conversations of his passengers along his route. Paterson loves his partner Laura as they continue to plan their future together and support each other’s interests. He takes their dog Marvin for walks and visits a local bar called Shades for quiet social interactions and a fresh beer.

It moves at a snails pace. You’re just a passenger along for the journey as it makes a few stops along the way. The passengers are interesting and insightful people. The film is not without excitement. Paterson’s bus breaks down in one scene, and he rather heroically stops what he thinks is going to be a shooting in Shades. Throughout the film, it feels like there is a setup for Marvin to be dognapped, but it never happens. A recurring motif of twins that I’m not really sure has a point. There is a thin plot that has its own rewards and conflicts and is ultimately a satisfying drama. Paterson, the man, and Paterson, the town, are both pleasant, wholesome, strong, and poetic.

Jim Jarmusch is showing appreciation for the little things, poetry, small towns, and ordinary lives. Finding poetry in the little daily moments . Adam Driver and Golshifteh Farahani are good as Paterson and Laura, living content with one another. There are many references to former local resident and poet William Carlos Williams and makes a point that Paterson, New Jersey is worth visiting for being a poetic city in history and in life.

**Gimme Danger (2016)** ***\*\*\*\* Cool***

***“We'd get stoned, turned out the lights, and put on Harry Partch.”***

A more traditional formatted structure compared to Jarmusch’s previous documentary Year of the Horse. Another look and a formative band from his youth. Gimme Danger uses archive footage, archive recordings, photographs, present-day interviews, and cut-out animation to tell the story of Iggy Pop and the Stooges. Their rise, their fall, and their reunion.

Beginning with Iggy’s story, we learn about his upbringing and early days as a drummer in garage bands. A lot of detail about how they all came together and the early days of the band and their struggle to get national attention. They talk about all of their influences and the type of exciting shows they wanted to and eventually put on for an audience featuring the invention of the stage dive apparently. The loss of members to tragedy and time. The film details the ups and downs of their career together right up to entering the Rock N’ Roll Hall of Fame in 2010.

As a documentary, this is by the numbers, but there is enough of an interesting story here even if you are not a fan of the Stooges. They all give of the same energy and desire to entertain. Jarmusch just wants to sit back and hear their stories in their own words, and the movie is better for it. It should go without saying, but I’ll say it anyway, the music is cool.

**The Dead Don’t Die (2019)** ***\*\* Okay***

***“Oh man, this isn't gonna end well.”***

Welcome to Centerville. A real nice place. In this quiet, sleepy town, Chief of Police Cliff Robertson, his deputies, and the townsfolk must deal with the increasingly strange goings on affecting their town. Centerville is populated with many typical small town farmers, hermits , business owners, and eccentric personalities.

The Dead Don’t Die was originally a letdown to me. I liked it more second time around but only marginally. There’s a lot of ideas here that don’t necessarily work and some that do. References to Romero and the type of commentary he had in his movies. The zombies holding onto their phones looking for wi-fi signal is funny joke. There’s a recurring meta joke about some characters knowing this is a work of fiction, and they mention Jim by name.

The cast is very good, with many playing very small roles. Adam Driver and Bill Murray have good chemistry together as Chief and Deputy. Chloe Sevigny is really incredible as another deputy that completely unravels as the story progresses. The rest of the town is populated by Danny Glover, Tilda Swinton, Steve Buscemi, Carol Kane, Tom Waits, and others.

This movies biggest problems are the nighttime scenes. Fredick Elmes and Jarmusch have worked together several times, and each time has been really good except for here. They are shooting day for night, and it just looks like nighttime with no lights around. It’s all grey.

I don’t think Jim Jarmusch set out to make a sensical movie. And I think the less sense it makes, then that’s the point. The world doesn’t make sense. It is falling apart, and there’s no reason why. Even the Aliens living among us are leaving the planet because they have the option. The film plays out like a typical zombie apocalypse and has some funny moments and jokes. It seems to want us to embrace our destruction, but it doesn’t really offer any comfort with the absurdity it presents.

***“I prefer to be subcultural rather than mass-cultural. I'm not interested in hitting the vein of the mainstream” – Jim Jarmusch***

This was a fun marathon. Even when the films aren’t as good the masterpieces his films still have great qualities. The dry humour and the interesting characters kept my interest with each new movie. I never felt like he was pandering to his audience and he is just telling stories that interest him. Working with cool actors, musicians, poets, artists, photographers, and friends. And always keeping things cool.

Jim Jarmusch has a new movie out later this year. Father Mother Borther Sister, set in both North America and Europe. Including my home country, Ireland. I am really excited for the new film and whatever may come next for Mr. Jarmusch",2,1758478227.0,TrueFilm,0,1.0,False

But in all seriousness, if you notice me waxing a little reflective here, blame it on the fact that words are my favorite way to connect.)

I’ve always been fascinated by how communication shapes relationships, how a single well-chosen phrase can make you laugh, think, or feel seen. That’s part of what draws me here: the hope of finding conversations that feel intentional, not just fleeting. Sometimes it feels like communication has been stripped down to quick taps and shorthand. Emojis instead of thoughts. Reactions instead of reflection. I miss when there was space to pause, think, and reply with something complete, in a back-and-forth conversation—something that actually said *something*. That’s what I’m hoping to find here.

A little about me: I’m in my 30s, a working professional who stays pretty busy, but I make time to enjoy the small things. Coffee in the quiet of the morning before the mailbox explodes. Long walks outdoors (sometimes to “clear my head,” sometimes just because snacks are waiting on the other side). I like stories—whether in books, films, or conversations—that spark thought and emotion, and I find myself drawn to people who can linger in an idea and explore it deeply. You can also check my profile to see my thoughts on the current state of collaborative writing community, haha.

What I’m looking for is simple: thoughtful, communicative people who enjoy meaningful back-and-forth. I appreciate long-form writing, but I also enjoy the rhythm of real-time conversations when the timing works out. At the end of the day, I’d just like to connect with someone genuine: someone who values curiosity, humor, reflection, and the art of actual conversation.

My partner and I were supposed to head out to see her family yesterday but we moved it to today, Sunday, since a package we had ordered for them didn’t arrive on time. Today comes, I had a restroom run twice this morning & I felt fine but worried about having to use the bathroom during our long drive. My partner advised me to stay home but I said no it’s okay, I want to go just as long as I get medication to help the pain. We got gas, coffee and the medication then my stomach started hurting again. I told her I had to run back home to use the bathroom, she suggested I stay. So I said sure I think I’ll just go home and stay then she gets upset with me. She tells me, yeah you should’ve f**king done that the first time. I said what do you mean? I felt fine but it started hurting again. She says, yes but you don’t listen. I’m annoyed.
I just decided not to go home, and it went on and on with back and forth argument. I told her she’s inconsiderate and insensitive to the situation. She told me I always do this whenever we have to hit the road. Mind you, she’s referring to stories that happened years ago when I had severe IBS that I couldn’t control - similar to what is happening to me right now. I told her she’s mentioning the past and this hasn’t happened in such a long time. I’m always out with her and her family, seeing her parents and sisters whenever she goes out. So to say this to me this time was mind blowing. I told her that she’s guilt tripping me for changing my mind, but I followed what she said. I decide to stay, she gets mad and says no I can’t stand you just go home. I go home, she says you see you should’ve listened to me. This is annoying. I told her that my symptoms were out of my control and I can’t believe she’s this annoyed at me, to the point where we’re cursing at each other and saying hurtful things. She told me to drive myself back home, which I did. She used my car to see her family. She slammed my door when she was leaving the passenger side, and when I asked are you fr? You slammed the door? She says, “shut the f*ck up.” I looked at her and she said oh what, you tell me I’m an inconsiderate pos and I can’t tell you to stfu? Words were exchanged all over again & im crying while writing this post. 
This is the person I expected to propose to me one day, and we planned our future together. In the moment I’m so hurt and thinking about what just happened. She used to guilt trip me before and I felt gaslit in the past and she claims she never has. I admit our communication has improved but today was not in my bingo card.

I read a fair amount of posts about which machine one should get, but to be honest I'm kinda lost, as every post brings new machine, and when they get praised on one post, they get criticized the next post.

I write this post to get some help in this matter and help me decide which one to chose, or at least have a short list in which I can chose.

For the budget, I would say that 500€ is my maximum, I can go up to 600 if there is some very interesting model, but it needs to be outstanding for its price.

What I'm looking for is something easy to use (which is the case for most automatic machin, BUT some of the reviews sometimes pointed that some parameters are sometimes a bit hard to understand) as I'll use it for me and my girlfriend, who's not a coffee expert and will not appreciate to learn 25 different parameters.
I mainly drink black coffee, but she likes milked one, that's why I need some milk option on the machine (and as I'm looking for one with this option, one with a good cappuccino option could be really cool).
I would really appreciate if it's not really hard to take care of it, if you need to do complex operations to keep it clean, I'll gladly pass.

Idk if I forgot something important, but if you need some information to help me, don't hesitate to ask me, I'm coming from some pod option, not a really expensive one, so it will be a good upgrade, but I always try to have the best possible with my money haha",1,1758477915.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False

Have used them twice and am in desperate need of a good, strong cup of coffee!  I am only getting weak, insipid stuff and am getting cranky.

I used to use a blade grinder and a cuisinart drip maker.  Used 60g of beans, ground fine-ish with some large chunks because it was a blade grinder.  I recently had a great cup of drip coffee that demonstrated that I needed to up my coffee game, hence the purchase of new equipment.

Yesterday I used setting 7 on the Ode 2, 82 grams of Methodical Belly Warmer, Sept 9 roast date Medium Dark beans, 9 cups of water, guided brew dark, and brewed coffee so thin I could have read the newspaper through a clear cup full.

Today I went with setting 1 on the Ode2, 80 grams of Sisters Coffee Medium Roast Espresso Blend coffee, 9 cups of water, guided brew medium, and while it was a bit stronger it was certainly not a good full bodied cup of coffee.

I expected a learning curve but not such a huge step backward in coffee quality while getting started.

Any suggestions as to where I might change things to get a better morning outcome? At this point, anything strong would be great and then I could change from there for taste, but weak coffee is why I never order coffee at restaurants, HELP please.",1,1758477857.0,FellowProducts,1,1.0,False

1nmyx79,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1nmyx79/did_i_make_a_huge_mistake_out_of_college/,Did I make a huge mistake out of college?,"So I graduated in May 2024, and like a lot of people graduating these days, I went through hell trying to land my first role. I eventually got to the point in the spring of THIS year where I had three offers on the table—one of which I accepted because it was in my preferred city and came with a project manager title. At the time, I found it a little odd that I’d be given a project manager role straight out of college, but I figured it might be warranted given my specialized technical degree, internship, job shadowing experience, and numerous leadership positions in clubs.

When I met with my manager and the owners on-site before accepting the position, they told me there would be a lot of hands-on, in-person training, which would require the role to be based in the office. That sounded fine to me. I was desperate to get started in my career—ANYTHING at that point. But the in-person training never happened. I discovered that my manager and the only other person on my team worked fully remote. The manager only came into the office once every two or three weeks to meet with senior sales staff. Meanwhile, I was commuting two hours a day via the NYC subway, so seeing this double standard quickly became frustrating.

At my first quarterly review, I brought this up and requested at least a few work-from-home days each week. A few days later, my manager got on a call with me—along with HR—to inform me that my request had been denied. The reason? “My role works with XYZ teams in the office.” I was shocked. In reality, I sit completely alone in the corner of a room and don’t interact with anyone. I didn’t even know which teams they were talking about, let alone who was on them. It felt like a flat-out lie. Then, a few weeks later, they hired a new person onto our team—and that person is fully remote too.

While that was incredibly frustrating, things now seem to be getting worse. During the week of 9/11, subway commuting in the city was AWFUL. This is my first year in NYC, so I wasn’t prepared for it. I ended up arriving 10 minutes later than usual, which happened to be during a mandatory sales training session (I don’t do sales either). I guess the owner noticed my absence and reported to my manager that I wasn’t arriving on time. My manager brought this up with me, and I explained that I commute over an hour via subway—an imperfect system that sometimes becomes unpredictable. I also emphasized that my intention is always to be on time.

But now I’m genuinely getting concerned. This past Friday, I arrived at the office exactly on time—between 8:59 and 9:00 a.m. I booted up my computer, went to wash my hands, used the restroom, and made my coffee. When I got back, my manager called me around 9:10am. Apparently, he had sent me a Teams message at 8:59 a.m. asking where I was. He said he was following up on our earlier conversation about tardiness and wanted to know why I hadn’t responded. I was immediately annoyed—he had never done this before. I explained I had just gotten in, was booting up my computer, and getting coffee. He pressed again: “Okay, well I noticed you didn’t answer my message—” I cut him off and firmly said, “I got here at 9.” He backed off.

This pattern of double standards and now toxic micromanagement is making me seriously question this company—and I’m only five months in. I started getting suspicious about their business practices and decided to dig deeper online. Turns out, this company is the product of a selloff by the same owners. Their last company has some very disturbing reviews from former employees—calling them greedy scammers who treated people terribly, scammed customers, lied to staff about the sale, and didn’t help anyone find work afterward.

I moved across the state and signed a lease just to work here. I turned down two other offers—both from much more credible organizations. I studied renewable energy, and the people at this company openly mock climate policy and legislation. They literally say it’s a scam. To each their own, but that’s completely misaligned with my values—especially when it comes to work culture. I feel so stupid for choosing this place.

Now I’m five months in. My gut tells me the best course of action is to stick it out as long as possible to gain more experience, so I’ll have a better chance of hopping to something better. But I’m honestly really concerned about my stability and future. I feel like I’m being targeted, they’re not going to help me grow professionally, and they clearly don’t care about me or my quality of life.

Has anyone else been in this situation? What did you do? What should I do? Is hopping jobs after just five months—in a market as tough as this—something I should seriously consider, even with such little experience? Should I start applying now?

I know this is a long post, but this whole experience has become deeply concerning.
Thanks.

1nmyss9,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nmyss9/the_voice_in_my_dream_said_next_stop_minced_meat/,The voice in my dream said: ‘Next stop… Minced Meat’,"I was dreaming.

Ever since I was a child, I sometimes realize, mid-dream, that I’m dreaming.
This was one of those times.

For reasons I couldn’t explain, I found myself alone on a dim, deserted train platform.
The lights were low—sickly sodium bulbs that made everything look washed out.
I thought to myself: what a gloomy dream.

Then a voice came over the loudspeaker.
A flat, lifeless male voice, as if someone had emptied a human of warmth and left only tone.

“The train will arrive shortly.
If you board that train… you will face something terrifying.”

Not long after, a train arrived.
It wasn’t a proper train. It looked exactly like a child’s amusement-park toy—rounded, small, wrong.
Pale men and women sat in rigid rows like dolls, their faces blank, their hands folded, motionless.

I told myself it was a dream and that I could wake whenever I wanted.
Whenever I knew I was dreaming, I usually woke myself.
So I tested it. I boarded.

I sat three rows from the back.
The carriage smelled faintly of oil and old candy—an impossible, nostalgic smell that made my stomach twist.
Warm, stagnant air drifted through the car; it was so vivid I began to doubt it was only a dream.

“Departing now…”

The voice spoke again.
The train lurched forward.

My heart pounded—equal parts fear and a pulled curiosity that felt like a knife.

We plunged into a tunnel. The walls were bathed in a strange purple light—like the ghost of a carnival ride I used to hate as a kid.
I told myself: it’s memory. Nothing else.

Then the voice announced, slow and clinical:

“Next stop… Ikizukuri… Ikizukuri.”

Ikizukuri—alive-slicing. The word was a punch to the gut.

From the back of the carriage came a scream.
I turned.

Four tiny figures—small, filthy, dressed in rags—swarmed the man in the last seat.
They moved with a frantic, insect-like speed. Their knives flashed cold and precise.

They cut him open—slicing as if filleting fish.
The smell hit me: copper and rot. He screamed. Organs were pulled, one by one, and laid out like grotesque offerings.

A woman with long hair sat directly behind me. Pale as the train’s paint. Motionless, expressionless, staring straight ahead as if watching a play.
Her calm made the scene worse. She didn’t react. She did not blink.

I froze. This was beyond imagination. For the first time in one of my lucid dreams, I wondered if lucid meant anything at all.

When I looked back again, he was gone—replaced by a heap of red-black flesh. The woman remained, blank as before.

The voice came again, colder, mechanical:

“Next stop… Gouging… Gouging.”

Two of the little figures appeared and, with jagged spoons, began to gouge the woman’s eyes.
Her still face contorted into a scream so close behind me I felt the pressure in my ears.
Eyes dangled. Warm liquid filled the air and my throat tightened.

I hunched forward, trembling. I couldn’t—wouldn’t—watch more.

And by the order of things… I realized I was next.

I fought to wake myself, to clamp down on that thin, fragile thread of lucidity I always relied on.
But a horrible curiosity kept me pinned. I wanted to hear what they would announce about me.
I wanted to know the word.

The voice came once more:

“Next stop… Minced Meat… Minced Meat.”

I felt my blood go cold.
Panic surged like a wave. I squeezed my eyes shut and forced the chant: Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.

Usually, that was enough.

A mechanical whir began—far off at first, then unmistakably present.
One of the small creatures climbed into my lap. It held a strange machine—cold metal, teeth and plates—and brought it close to my face.

The whir grew louder. My body felt blown by wind. My palms were wet. I thought: this is the end.

Then, silence.

I opened my eyes.

…

I had escaped.

I was drenched in sweat. Tears burned my cheeks. I staggered to the kitchen and drank until my chest unclenched.
It had felt so real—so impossibly, terrifyingly real—but after all, surely… only a dream.

The next day, I told friends. They laughed. To them, it was only a dream.

Four years later—college, a part-time job, a life that smelled of coffee and deadlines—I had almost buried it.
Then, one night, the memory came back like a hand around my throat.

“Next stop… Gouging… Gouging.”

The image flashed: the woman, eyes being ripped out.

I panicked. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.
But this time, waking was harder. The chant wouldn’t let me go.

“Next stop… Minced Meat… Minced Meat.”

1nmypn2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuiltToTest/comments/1nmypn2/reveal_the_best_espresso_machine_casabrews_worth/,Reveal the Best Espresso Machine CASABREWS Worth Your Countertop,"**Unpacking My Experience with the Casabrews 4700Gense-02 Espresso Machine**  

Testing out the Casabrews 4700Gense-02 espresso machine in my own kitchen has been nothing short of an adventure. I love a well-crafted cup of coffee, and having this semi-automatic machine has transformed my mornings. With its sharp stainless steel design and thoughtful features, it’s built to impress even the most discerning coffee lovers. This is not just an espresso machine; it’s a coffee shop condensed into your countertop.

**Design and Build Quality**  

The sleek and modern stainless steel exterior is the first thing that caught my eye. The Casabrews 4700Gense-02 doesn’t take up an overwhelming amount of counter space, which is a big plus for my somewhat cluttered kitchen. It’s compact but feels solid and durable, weighing about 16 pounds. The transparent 51 oz water tank is a standout feature. It’s conveniently detachable, making refilling and cleaning a breeze. Plus, the easy-to-use dial interface for selecting steam, hot water, or pre-programmed single and double espresso shots adds to the intuitive design. Honestly, even my coffee-inept friend found it simple to use when visiting.    

**Performance and Brewing Versatility**  

What makes this espresso machine stand out is its stellar 20-bar pressure system. I noticed a significant difference in the aroma and richness of the coffee, which I didn’t get from my previous coffee maker. The professional Italian pump ensures every shot is crafted to perfection, and the 1350W motor adds ample power to the process. I tested it with Americano, lattes, and cappuccinos, and each cup tasted as if it were brewed by a barista. Adjusting the brewing temperature was another neat touch. While I love steaming hot coffee in the morning, a slightly cooler cup works better for my mom, and this machine lets us both enjoy coffee the way we like it.  

**Highlights**  
- The professional 20-bar pressure system guarantees rich and aromatic coffee.  
- Adjustable brewing temperature tailors to different preferences.  
- Compact stainless-steel design blends style with practicality.  

**Want Casabrews 4700Gense-02? Discover the price on Amazon.**  

**Milk Frother Capabilities**  

Using the milk frother on this machine was a game-changer. As someone experimenting with latte art (full disclosure: the leaf still looks like... well, not a leaf), the frother didn’t disappoint. It produced creamy, textured microfoam consistently, elevating the quality of my cappuccinos and lattes. The foam is so rich that it adds a velvety layer to every sip, creating that café-like experience. My sister, an iced macchiato fan, tried frothing her milk before pouring it into the drink and even commented on how luxurious it felt.  

**Benefits**  
- Powerful steam wand for professional-grade milk microfoam.  
- Easy for latte art enthusiasts, even amateurs like me.  
- Hot water wand doubles effortlessly for making Americanos or tea.  

**Drawbacks**  

That said, no product is perfect. While the performance delivered on many fronts, there are quirks that might bother potential buyers.  

- Inconsistent results with older coffee grounds – fresh beans are essential.  
- Slight learning curve on grind size and tamping pressure for those new to espresso machines.  
- Limited reservoir capacity for heavy use, like hosting a coffee-filled brunch.  

**Peer Products**  

Comparing this espresso machine to others in a similar price range, such as the Breville Bambino Plus or the DeLonghi EC155, it offers plenty of value. The Casabrews excels with its 20-bar pressure pump, whereas the DeLonghi tops out at 15 bars. While the Breville may have slightly more advanced frothing capabilities, it also lies in a higher price bracket. The Casabrews strikes a balance, offering affordable quality with impressive performance, albeit at the cost of some premium touches.  

**Quality for Price**  

Is it worth the investment? Definitely, if you love experimenting with coffee at home without spending a fortune. The features of the Casabrews 4700Gense-02 justify its cost, especially considering its professional-level brew quality and versatility. Sure, it’s not the cheapest option out there, and there’s a bit of a learning curve, but for the experience and results it delivers, it’s hard to argue against its value.

* Big Sur is incredible and Monterey is a gem. We had perfect weather the entire weekend with no marine layer or clouds, even in the mornings. We loved our visit and will definitely be back! 
* Stayed at a dog-friendly AirBnB in Marina. The place was great and exactly what we needed (particularly for the price); however, I think we would have enjoyed staying in town. The additional 15 minute drive doesn't seem like much, but it added up as we went back and forth quite a bit.
* We visited over Labor Day weekend. We knew it was going to be busy and it definitely was, but we were still able to do *almost* everything we wanted.  We were flexible and if a park or pull off was too busy, we skipped it.
* I had just finished Steinbeck's East of Eden before this trip and driving through the Salinas Valley after reading it was pretty surreal. Would highly recommend!

**Day 1 - Friday: Arrive/Big Sur with Dog**

* Camped in Pismo Beach the previous night. Arrived in Monterey around 11 AM.
* All of the following stops are **dog friendly,** as long as they are leashed.
* Big River Inn General Store for lunch - Carnitas burrito that we shared and it was phenomenal. We found open chairs in the river that we sat in, which was a fun experience. Would definitely recommend.
* Big Sur State Park - River Path/Redwoods Deck - Quick stop as dogs are not allowed on the rest of the trails. My first time seeing the Redwoods up close and I was blown away; however, not sure it's worth the $10 on its own.
* Pfeiffer Beach (Attempt #1) - Parking lot was full and was told to come back later by the attendant at the top turnaround.
* Julia Pfeiffer Vista Point - Quick pull off with a stunning view
* McWay Falls - Quick stop off the highway to view the cove and falls. Amazing view and well worth the stop.
* Henry Miller Memorial Library - An outdoor bookstore with some funky art displays. This was a great stop that we really enjoyed. There was a great selection of local books and we got a kick out of the ""forbidden book tree"".
* Pfeiffer Beach (Attempt #2) - Got in the second time ($15 - separate from state park). Was very windy but really cool beach, another popular stop that seems worth checking out.
* Drove to the AirBnB in Marina to check in.
* Dinner at Tarpy’s Roadhouse (no dog) - Shared crab cake appetizers, a steak, a side of mac n cheese, and apple crisp for dessert. Great vibe sitting outside on the patio with live music playing. 

**Day 2 - Saturday: Big Sur without Dog**

* Later start than we wanted but on the road by 9:00 AM. Left our dog at the AirBnB for the day.
* Stopped in Monterey for coffee. Tried going to Captain + Stoker but the line was too long, so settled for Starbucks.
* Point Lobos State Natural Reserve (Attempt #1) - It was packed and probably \~0.5 mile walk just to get to the entrance, so skipped it and kept driving.
* Garrapata State Park Vista Point - Quick stop with a great view of the coast.
* Garrapata State Park - Whale Peak ""Hike"" - Parked at Gate 9 and jumped right on the staircase up. This was an awesome view from the top and a fun/easy hike to do (extremely windy though). We skipped the Soberanes Point tide pools as we were heading to the beach next, but looked awesome as well. Would definitely recommend!
* Garrapata Beach - Calla Lily Valley ""Hike"" - Another fun and quick hike to the lily valley (unfortunately the flowers weren't blooming) and then walked the beach back. This seemed like a nicer beach than Pfeiffer, but was very windy/chilly so didn’t stay too long. (note: this is also dog friendly)
* Bixby Bridge - Another popular spot, but was well worth it. We walked a bit up the road across the highway for a great view from the backside. Also, people standing right on the edge of the cliffs are crazy...
* Nepenthe/Cafe Kevah - Arrived around 12 PM (not ideal) and parking was a nightmare. The wait for Nepenthe was 1.5 hrs so settled for the Cafe which had a decent Pigs in the Blanket and Ham Sandwich. It is a great spot with some incredible views (saw whales from the Nepenthe deck), but probably should have skipped this. Would be interested to know if the food at Nepenthe is worth the wait.
* Big Sur State Park - River Gorge Hike - Parking lots were full so parked on the road and walked to the trailhead at Parking Lot 3 (bit far, but not bad and didn't have to pay for parking). Really fun hike up the river and scrambling over rocks. The water felt great in the heat, too. It must be a local spot because it was packed with people having a great time.
* Point Lobos State Natural Reserve (Attempt #2) - Attempted to stop on the way back but huge lineup entering the parking lot so skipped it again.
* Rested at the AirBnB for a bit and then drove to Monterey with our dog.
* Dinner - Pacific Bowls and Rolls - Picked up BYO Poke Bowls for dinner and found a parking spot near Heart Shaped rock to watch the sunset and eat dinner. Even though the food was just okay, still our favorite meal of the trip and would highly recommend something similar.
* Drove Sunset Drive on the way back to the AirBnB after the sun went down.
* Stopped at Cheesecake Dreamations for dessert in Marina - fantastic cheesecakes!

**Day 3 - Sunday: Monterey**

* Kayaking in Monterey Bay through Adventures By the Sea (8 AM) - Awesome experience! We saw wild sea otters and sea lions playing in the kelp and our tour guide was terrific. It was an unusually calm day which was nice, but the flies were swarming without any wind. They let us take the kayaks to the harbor after the tour and technically we could use them all day.
* Breakfast/Coffee at Captain + Stoker - Another long line but moved quick. Maybe an unpopular opinion, but we didn't think the coffee was very good.
* Monterey Bay Aquarium - Bought tickets ahead of time as it was very busy, but the line moved quick. The jellyfish exhibits were incredible and seeing the sea otters feeding was a highlight. Definitely the most impressive aquarium I have been to. A bit overwhelming at times with the amount of people packed into the exhibits.
* Walked around Cannery Row a bit after the aquarium and grabbed a sandwich at Coniglio Brothers Italian Deli (#1 - Uncle Philly) which we enjoyed!
* Back to the AirBnB to nap and pick up our dog.
* 17 Mile Drive at Sunset - Beautiful drive and well worth it (believe we paid \~$12?). We stopped at the Lone Cypress Tree right as the sun was going down which was amazing. Enjoyed seeing the golf courses but didn’t stop and ended in Carmel.
* Dinner - Flaherty’s Seafood Grill and Oyster Bar (Carmel) - Had our dog with us so sat on the patio which worked great. Crab cake appetizers, Seafood Paella (MASSIVE - should have split), and the Amazing Brioche Crab Louie Melt. Overall enjoyed the food and spot!
* Walked around Carmel a bit, but was pretty late at this point so most shops were closed.",1,1758477281.0,MontereyBay,0,1.0,False

BP somewhere around 140/90. Pre-coffee I'm 115/70. One hour after drinking ONE cup of coffee until bedtime I'm hypertensive. This stuff is poison for me. So I'm quitting.

Longer unmedicated ADHD fueled version:

My general health has gotten really bad over the last couple of weeks due to tachycardia, high blood pressure, and heart palpitations. I'm wearing an EKG right now. My symptoms are constant fatigue and anxiety.

This is all happening despite my best attempts to get healthy since late July. I've been walking 4-6 miles a day and going to the gym 3 times a week, eating disgustingly healthy, taking steps to reduce my stress, and significantly cutting back and quitting my stimulant meds for ADHD. 

I always assumed because of Vyvanse and Adderall that I take for my ADHD. My doctor did too and advised me to quit those completely but said I could keep caffeine.

Frustratingly my BP hasn't budged in the last 2 weeks off stimulant meds. Literally 0 change. Which sucks because I'm bouncing off the freaking walls and making impulse buys on Amazon.

I started taking BP readings before and after coffee and the difference is insane. 115/70 to 138/85 less than an hour after drinking a single cup of coffee.

I'm pretty sure that if I don't stop drinking coffee, I'm going to die of heart problems. So I'm quitting tomorrow cold turkey.

I've done this a couple of times in the past. I know it's going to suck. But I've gotta do it because I want to meet my grandkids one day. It's not a choice anymore for me!

1nmyn17,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1nmyn17/aita_for_losing_a_friend_over_setting_a_boundary/,AITA for losing a friend over setting a boundary and not agreeing to gym date?,"Please be kind as this is my first ever submission and English is not my first language. I'll try to make the story make sense as much as possible 😄 No real names used. 

I recently lost a friend, but stink of how it went down still bothers me. 

I (31f) and my friend (32f) let's call her Betty, met what the same low level agency job while back. We're from the same county (although different parts of the country), and migrated over to UK eventually meeting at this job. I started to work there first and about a month later Batty arrived. Even tho she's a tad older, she's taller than me and more fit. When I first saw her I actually thought that the company started hiring under age kids 😆. Betty and I started talking and bonded quickly despite our differences. We were working the same shifts and it got to a point where people calling us wifeys and schedule our breaks at the same time as well as put our names next to each other on OT sheet, as everyone (including managers) knew that is one of us would work extra hours the other one would too. 

Betty was staying over with some friends but it wasn't ideal so when she found new place I helped her more. We share a lot of talks and secrets, insecurities and so on. I think it is worth mention that I encounter some childhood trauma as well as quite toxic relationships in the past so I struggled a lot with making friends. Therefore, founding Betty was like a blessing! We've been hanging out on breaks, going for coffee during lunch time, meeting before and after work, it was a bliss! 

As the time went on, some things happen with Bettys personal/romantic live that actually affected her work and she needed to change jobs, to get away form guy she was seeing (a whole story on its own!). As a luck would have it, a friend of mine invited me to apply for job at this little factory where I have been recommended directly to the owner. I spoke with Betty and we went together to check out the job. Soon enough, we both had new start at new job with better pay and better deal (I stoke deal of my live going straight on contract and negotiatig comfortable hours that no-one but us had). We carpool often as her house was on my way to work so there was no point to take 2 unless she had something to do after work. We worked there for just over a year. 

I confessed to Betty that I always thought I am worth little bit more than factory work but giving my job history it's hard for potential employers to give me a chance (no colleagues education and when you come to strange country you grab any job you can get and so my records showed I'm perfect for factory/warehouse settings), but I started looking. Betty have rekindled with her ex and being at different jobs started to bother her as well as the little factory we worked in is always cold 🥶. Betty applied for job at out old company new site and started working with her ex again. I, on the other hand, stroke an interview with agency that was hiring for customer service role at big corporation. I got the job! 

Even tho we have split, Betty and I stayed in touch although it was bit more difficult to hang out together, in this new age it's easy to stay in touch using technology. Me, with my social anxiety weirdly wired brain, am very comfortable working at the corner of my room, on occasion sending messages out to check up on people. The dlfew friends that I have known and understand that. Not to say I'd refuse to leave the house or I'm completely ani social nut job, no no no 😉. Betty once checked up on me and moaned that she's the only one reaching out and this bothered her. I immediately felt bad and went into spiral with few sleepless night, but since I was remembering to message her more frequently so she knows that even tho we no longer work together, I'm still here within reach of the phone. 

One more side story and I get to the point, I promise... whilst Betty and I still worked together I have had some relationship issues with my long term partner. It wasn't to the extremes but words were said, I made some stupid thing and broke down. To salvage relationship and the whole ""letting my anxiety take best of me"" I attended therapy. It was a great eye opening experience. My therapist not only helped me work through my unprocessed grief afte losing my dad to cancer, she also helped my understand myself better give me healthy tips on how to manage my head. One of the sessions I told her what happened with Betty other week (The ""I'm the only one reaching out"" speech) and how that make me feel, she listened, she nob, she smiled. At the end of that session she said something along the lines of ""Next week... Would you like to talk about toxic relationships?"" 😅

Now to the friendship ending gym debacle!!! 😱
Betty is kind of person who likes working out. After we went out separate ways, job wise, my 9-5 sitting job took tall on my weight. I started to go swimming that's the activity I enjoy and I'm there, on my own, head sticking out of water, it's great. I had a little depression relapse alongside money issues and I stopped going swimming. When I was stable enough I met up with Betty and she encouraged me to join gym. She had my best interest in heart and she assured me that there are coaches there who can explain how things work and how to use machines and sold it with how great she feels when she unload her frustration or whatever on a treadmill. She even said she will go with me (yay). I thought about and decided to take her advice. I signed up, and went for introduction. I was doing it for maybe a month or two with additional classes, but I didn't feel great. I was sweating and super uncomfortable, the waiting for machines to use after someone, starting around with sweat dripping off my forehead, people staring at me... Nah. I stopped going and I invested instead in some home weights and bench. Talking £70 for live, of $35 per month... #math! 
Coffee time with Betty. I told her that I have tiny gym equipment at home and I'm doing much better. She asked what happened with gym. I said I tried it, but I don't think it's for me and told her about all those feelings and insecurities. She told me off for not inviting her and she said ""you know, nobody cares, right? I mean: people going there to exercise, not to mock or launch at you! I often see really fat people with like lose skin visibly hanging and the don't care that just do their thing!"". I get that she tried to encourage me, but it did not help. I know this. I know people don't give flying f*ck about me being there. I'm aware of that, but I still feel the way I feel. She said I should go with her but I said that I don't feel like gym is a social meet-up I can handle. Since this time, every time she mentioned gym I had little anxiety. I just don't see myself there.
Comes few days after new year I check up with Betty and ask how things are going, how she's feeling what she's been up to and everything. All good how are you - that sort of things. I say we'll new year, new possibilities (all the cliché after new year talk). This is how conversation uncovered:
Betty: hmmm thats good. So maybe this year will be the year when Molly (fake name for me) will finally go with Betty to the gym, because Betty keep asking and Molly always turns me down??
Me (heart rate elevating as I hate telling people no): that's funny, because I remember that Molly politely declined every time, because of how she feels about gym. But maybe we could go for a walk? I hear England is very beautiful and this year could be a year to explore it! 😉 - side note, I tried to find middle ground if she want active meeting I thought I found sweet stop where everyone will be happy. This is what I got: 
Betty: Fine. I'll ask someone else then, because how many time one one ask to spend time with me on my conditions. One f*cking lousy hour you can't dedicate to me. It's always either me coming to you or meet at coffee shot. You can't even message when you know you are nearby and ask if you can drop for coffee. So I wish you nice walks. And yes, England can be beautiful, but you got to move your fat ass out of the house first. BYE! 
 
I was flabbergasted! With the dropping in for coffe she might have point but she's working shifts and 90% of the time she's staying with her partner, nowhere near her house, she lives near my food shopping route so can't just stop by with frozen in my car. That's why I tried schedule time. With her coming to me- I invited her during Christmas to my house because I was making traditional polish Christmas dish and wanted to share it. She barely ever invited me. Coffee shop is where we bounded the most.
I considered replying or leaving, but I said my peace with: Wow! Well... Well... Incompatibilities can happen. 
I didn't know that coffee shop is such a big problem for you. What can we do. I just don't see gym as a place to socialise and it makes me super uncomfortable.

She left me on read.

I reached out to him a couple of months ago asking if he wanted to meet for coffee (long story short I wanted to have peace and calm between us as we run in similar communities and circles), he replied saying he didn't expect to hear from me and that yes he'd be open to that. Then I had a missed call off him at 1am and a following message saying he was free tomorrow morning.

Next morning I replied as I was asleep by then, explained I wasn't about until the following week but offered some days. He never replied?

Fast forward to 2 days ago, his very mentally unwell mother started phoning and texting me out of nowhere. She obviously didn't know who she was calling and so I text my ex simply letting him know. 

His reply was along the lines of: thanks for telling him, he said his mum was really ill and to block her number, and then he said ""sorry for not getting back to you, I just didn't know why you reached out. I really hope you're well and happy"".

Anyway, after some back and forth he agreed to meet again, he told me he was free all the next day, he also started putting an inside joke in there. Again I was asleep.

Next morning I message with a plan for that afternoon, no response.

Manufacturer code: Philips 2200 EP2224/10
Article Nr: 876227

Context: I discovered small amounts of coffee grounds underneath the machine every time I moved it to clean the counter top. Inside everything was covered in coffee grounds. Mainly next to the coffee grinder where it has piled up 2,5cm (1in). I was able to clean most of it. The cause was a plastic hollow part used to connect the bean grinder to the brew group that was connected to the grinder with plastic clips. These have been completely torn/ground away whoch results in coffee grounds going where they shouldn't. I am contacting the manufacturer for a possible solution. Right now I'm wondering if I can continue to use the machine or if I should go without my coffee for some time instead of risking a house fire.

I carry a pescatarian diet. I have GERD. I’ve been on and off omeprazole and esomeprazole guided by my physicians. With that said I’ve been working on identifying my trigger foods. I have learned anything explicitly spicy and with red food dyes causes nausea. Milk sits too heavy in my stomach and causes diarrhea. Lactose free milk causes acid reflux. Additionally, although I could wheat initially, I’ve gone gluten free entirely and that’s helped a lot. I kept potatoes and rice in the diet and no issues with that. Per my GI doc, I take fiber supplements too. So thankfully that’s a win on identifying the main triggers.

However I’ve noticed every morning when I eat I experience real bad nausea. For context I start every morning with 2 hard boiled eggs with salt and a cup of black coffee and that’s it. This was the only thing that would sit well and did not cause acid reflux. I recently added oatmeal and that was nice. But then I noticed oatmeal with a splash of milk was not sitting well so I cut the milk out and that helped. Now it’s only made with water. And trust helped. But it came back. Then I cut oatmeal entirely, and I’m still experiencing nausea. I’m about to get an endoscopy soon but I’m curious if anyone has experience issues with reflux and nausea like this??

Anyway, I matched with my gym crush a couple weeks ago on hinge. Was really hoping they'd make a hinge because I wasn't gonna approach them in the gym lmao.

And we talk, and I ask her out on a date like usual. We have our first date, and it is the second, if not first, best first date I've ever had. I was making her laugh, I thought she was funny, no real breaks in convo. So I was like hell yeah let's go on a second.

All that week we were texting a ton. Like she would almost instantly respond to my texts. I don't see this as a red flag in and of itself, I thought it was sweet and showed me she was into me/the idea of us.

Come the second date last night, it was good for the most part but there were a lot more breaks in convo, and we just didn't vibe as much. It was a solid time though, I wasn't dreading it but towards the end I just wanted to go home tbh.

Few questions about myself, she mentioned her ex (benefit of the doubt on that one tho, we were kind of on the topic about formative life events, it had been a year and a half since the breakup)

And so when I got home I just pondered for like an hour as to whether or not I wanted to see her again. But after that hour, I just came to the conclusion that if I'm not this sure, I should just end it. 

So I was really straight up, ""hey x, I had a good time tonight but I'm really on the fence about continuing this, so I think it's only fair to you that I don't drag this out. I'll see you around the gym!""

She was of course cordial in her response.

I felt alright about it last night, but this morning I feel like I fucked up.

I feel like being unsure after 2 dates (5ish cumulative hours with this person) is totally ok and it's not leading them on to do a third. By then I think it's decision time, but I wasn't there yet obviously.

So now I'm wondering what could've been. The only POTENTIAL incompatibilities were that she seems to go out a lot more than I do, and seems more political than I am, but I don't see those as deal breakers

I ended it mostly based on how I was feeling in those moments when we were chatting for the last hour before the date ended, and I don't think I was being fair to myself or her by over analyzing it. 

For the hell of it, when I saw a friend for coffee this morning, I tried to treat our interactions the same way, and overanalyzed it when there was break in convo. Shocker, I felt exhausted and just wanted to go home.

I need to stop doing that shit when I go on dates and be in the moment more. I pressure myself to think of something to say, when I shouldn't do that.

Idk, I'm so mixed about the whole thing and I wish I just had true closure over the whole thing. And the worst part is, it is entirely my fault that I don't have said closure.

From now on I will always attempt a third date unless I see glaring red flags in the previous 2. I haven't felt this down in a long ass time

Thinking about it more, I feel even worse about it when I consider the idea that I am conflating my depleted social battery with no chemistry.

The first couple hours with her were good. The last couple weren't because I was just tired and wanted to go home. Social battery drained. I viewed this as ""I guess I don't have much chemistry with her"" but I feel this with EVERYONE I'm close to if we are just sitting talking. I don't know if it's possible for me to just endlessly talk with anyone unless we are actively doing something. Hence I don't think that's a deal breaker.

I need to do more activities with my dates, and I need to consider the idea of my social battery running out, instead of instantly labelling it as ""no chemistry"". Now I'm convinced I fucked up bad. Fuck",2,1758476867.0,dating,3,1.0,False

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZcC0N9HZMM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZcC0N9HZMM)



In the early morning hours of June 6, 1996, a frantic 911 call shattered the peace of a quiet Texas suburb. On the line was Darlie Routtier, a 26-year-old mother who claimed an intruder had broken into her home, stabbed her two young sons, Devon and Damon, and attacked her before fleeing. When police arrived, they found a gruesome scene: the two boys were brutally murdered, and Darlie had a slashed throat and other knife wounds.

The case seemed like a straightforward home invasion, but investigators quickly turned their attention to Darlie herself. The prosecution argued that the crime scene was staged, her wounds were self-inflicted, and she had murdered her children due to the family's financial difficulties. A now-infamous video of Darlie smiling and spraying Silly String on her sons' graves just eight days after their deaths was presented as evidence of her cold-hearted nature. In 1997, a jury agreed with the prosecution, and Darlie Routtier was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death.

However, the case is far from closed in the minds of many. Darlie has always maintained her innocence, and her defense team has pointed to several pieces of evidence that they believe prove her story. A bloody sock containing the boys' DNA was found 75 yards away from the house. A bloody fingerprint found on a coffee table and another on the utility room door did not match Darlie or anyone in her family. Furthermore, some medical experts have testified that her neck wound was too severe to be self-inflicted and came within millimeters of her carotid artery.

For decades, Darlie Routtier has sat on death row, fighting for new DNA testing on the evidence. Her supporters believe that modern forensic technology could finally reveal the identity of the true killer, while prosecutors remain convinced of her guilt. The case remains a deeply polarizing and haunting mystery.

What do you think happened that night? Was Darlie Routtier a cold-blooded killer who almost got away with the perfect crime, or is she the victim of a horrific tragedy, wrongfully convicted and waiting for justice?",5,1758476483.0,mystery,2,0.73,False

Our cities need teachers who can envision science and believe children in low income schools can find an interested in science because they are products of science.,"This, you can teach even if your aren't teaching it. Parents, guardians, speak the language, too:

Teach physics as the *language of everything we do*. Physics isn’t just formulas and lab experiments; it’s woven into every ordinary action and experience. If you frame it that way, people begin to *see* physics rather than just memorize it.

Here’s a way you could build that kind of teaching:

**1. Motion and Force (Mechanics)**

* Walking: Balance, friction between shoes and ground, center of mass shifting.
* Driving: Acceleration, velocity, Newton’s laws, momentum in braking.
* Falling: Gravity, air resistance, terminal velocity.

**2. Energy and Work**

* Eating: Food energy converted into kinetic energy, heat, and motion.
* Climbing stairs: Potential energy gained, work done against gravity.
* Appliances: Electric energy converted into mechanical or thermal energy.

**3. Waves and Sound**

* Talking: Vocal cords vibrating, sound waves traveling through air.
* Music: Frequency, resonance, harmonics.
* Cell phones: Electromagnetic waves transmitting signals.

**4. Light and Vision**

* Seeing colors: Reflection, absorption, wavelength.
* Glasses: Refraction, lenses correcting vision.
* Sunrise/sunset: Scattering of light in the atmosphere.

**5. Thermodynamics (Heat)**

* Cooking: Heat transfer (conduction, convection, radiation).
* Weather: Energy balance, pressure, phase changes.
* Breathing: Gas laws at work inside your lungs.

**6. Modern Physics (Quantum/Relativity)**

* Smartphones: Quantum mechanics in semiconductors.
* GPS: Relativity corrections for precise timing.
* MRI scans: Nuclear magnetic resonance.

You could even start each lesson with a daily-life hook, like:

* *“Why doesn’t your coffee stay hot?” → Thermodynamics*
* *“Why do you feel heavy in an elevator going up?” → Newton’s Laws*
* *“Why does your voice sound weird on a recording?” → Wave physics*

This way, students (or anyone) see that *everything is physics* — not abstract, but lived.

# Lesson: Walking Without Slipping — The Physics of Friction

**1. Everyday Hook (2–3 min)**  
Ask: *“Have you ever slipped on ice or a wet floor? What made it different from walking normally?”*

* Students usually say “it’s slippery,” which opens the door to *friction*.

**2. Concept (5–7 min)**

* Walking works because your foot pushes backward on the ground.
* By Newton’s 3rd law, the ground pushes you forward.
* This forward push is possible because of **friction**.
* On ice, friction is low → not enough forward push → you slip.

**3. Demonstration (5 min)**

* Have two students try walking across the floor:
   * one with regular shoes,
   * one with socks (less friction).
* Compare difficulty.

**4. Extension (5 min)**

* Cars: Why do tires have tread? (to increase friction with road).
* Sports: Why do basketball players wear sneakers with grip?
* Nature: Why do mountain goats have rough hooves?

**5. Wrap-up Question (2 min)**  
*“If friction disappeared right now, what could you still do? Could you even stand up?”*

* Answer: No — because every motion we take depends on friction.

**Takeaway:** Something as ordinary as *walking* is pure physics — Newton’s laws, forces, friction, and energy all working together.

Some background, I'm 21f and have only ever had jobs where the management/owners were either genuinely evil or everyone hated me and each other (hostile environment for all). These have been all rounding in a big corporate event space, sales assistant in small businesses but either way lots of customer service.

After me and all my coworkers were blanket fired from a shop/restaurant we'd been at (before hitting 6 months and being required notice), I quickly found work as a temporary Christmas sales assistant November last year at a shop that adhered to my interests and background. It was a small team of three including me, with a manager who was never there and had it worked out so that she was WFH but offloaded ordering stock to us as well so I'm still not clear what she does all day.

The three of them had such a tight ecosystem worked out that I found it hard to know what to take initiative with and what to stand back on. Due to this my colleague, Leanne, an older woman seems to think I'm encroaching on her while the manager, Tina, often comes in and scolds me for not doing enough or doing things ""her way"", which is by definition not the way they're done in the shop since she'd need to be there more than once a week for a halfday.

Tina constantly forgets what you tell her, is late or unresponsive and puts out incorrect and irregular rotas. I had no idea when I'd be let go after Christmas last year and it just kept running on, month by month, until now I've basically forced her to confirm I'll be here this Christmas too. She offloads her manager work to Leanne who is basically acting manager on the floor and always pissed about that fact. Because of this when Tina wants Leanne's behaviour changed she drills it into me and tells me off, knowing I'll tell her we're no longer do X since she'd be who trained me.

I had a particularly bad week when I was folding stock alone, with one earbud in listening to something to calm down. For context I've had a death in my family two weeks prior that hit us all pretty hard, my elderly landlord who I love told me he's ill and doesn't want treatment meaning one day I'll come home to the only home that's been mine to him gone and my future unknown, my romantic relationship and closest friendship have been thrown into question and I wasn't getting more than four hours sleep and was crying constantly. Tina only knew about the death, but came in, saw my phone playing something and picked it up from the counter. I turned to get it and pause it and apologise but she turned away and placed it away from me saying ""don't do that"" and ran off. When she came back she said I wasn't engaging properly and it can never happen again but wouldn't clarify what she meant. Perhaps that I'm sacked.

The thing is while I understand she has issues with younger people and their phones I have not displayed that issue in a year of working there. Everyone else does leisurely activities such as reading a book, writing, going on the computer for crosswords and articles when the shop is quiet as it always is and I doubt she'd come up and wordlessly snatch their book or unplug the computer since it shows zero respect. While I don't think I was right I don't think anyone should be touching anyone else's belongings without a word to them. The following day she micromanaged me by repeating herself, giving me a task and then watching me do it, redoing whatever she asked me to do like recounting the cash. All to let me know I wasn't trusted now even tho I've been left to train in new interns. In any case it's hard to take criticism from someone you think falls short at their own work constantly.

Later in the week when with Leanne, I informed her of a new bestseller I thought we should get in to which she responds what does that have to do with the shop. When I say well it's one of the most famous authors ever she replies ""So not Jane Austen?"" and then decides to order a couple anyway followed by a ""joke"" that we're trying to run a business and it's not my personal shopping place to use my discount which she's told me many times before unwarranted. These sorts of undercutting comments have been a trend I've made great effort to ignore so far. For context we all make casual comments and observations ab the shop, when Leanne agrees with me or my idea it's fine and we laugh, but when she doesn't instead of letting me know I've offended her or she doesn't agree she tells me ""It's not about what you think it's about the customers"". The next day (yesterday) I made a casual comment on an item that had been stagnant in the shop for a long while that I was glad to see it go since it didn't pop like the other items in the section. She says again it doesn't matter what I think. I finally say ""So I'm just supposed to have no opinion is that it?"" which shocked her so much she said she was going to leave early and that I was too ""angsty"". I then try to explain that it feels like everyone is allowed to be invested or to do things I'm not and I get the flack bc I'm technically a temp but am more senior than the interns who have a contract. I tell her I respect her and her opinions and would never speak to her the way she does to me. She reminds me of her 14 years there. I tell her when I'm respecting her or her opinion I don't compare our resumes, I think of the fact that I'd never want to upset her. She doesn't react well and I soon start crying which always happens during any kind of conflict much to my regret and take a break.

When I come back she seems genuinely sorry for upsetting me and I restate that I don't think our tenure should determine the care and respect we show one another. She just keeps saying she didn't realise how hard a week I was really having, missing the point and making it all about the emotion. She then asks my opinion on everything she's ordering and encourages me to still email the manager my ideas for another section. But if Tina'll only ever see me as a crap till jockey then I don't know what to do since I can't find a balance between them both.

The commute is also a stressful one either with an unreliable bus and then a 20 minute walk passed an always bustling train station or a bus to a dodgy tramline to said station and then another 10 minute walk. I'm always exhausted or nearly run over by stressed people or cars to and fro. My job to the evil ppl was an hour long bus from door to door and I preferred it. I know other ppl sit on the freeway for hours and I can't imagine the level of stress that would bring me.

The pros: other than those two underlying currents of disrespect I really get along with the interns. Tina will do her best to give any days off we ask for I recently took a 10 day trip this summer. The pay is the best I've ever had and I doubt any other position could offer the same for the amount of work I do and the downtime when it's quiet. I rarely have difficulties with customers compared to dealing with drunk sports fans and tweakers. There's no dress code. It's a paid hour for lunch with free coffee in the break room and nice people milling around the lovely historic building. If you're alone and can't take a lunch you can claim back the time by arriving late or leaving early another day. There's gorgeous gardens and the stock we carry is honestly lovely with a 30% discount.

* **Mood Boards:** Ditch the minimalist grids. Think overflowing collages of photos: slightly burnt waffles, messy syrup pours, mountains of sprinkles, happy customers with sticky fingers. Use TEXTURES. Fabric swatches, actual sprinkles (sealed, of course), wood samples.
* **Color Palettes:** Forget beige. Go for warm golds, rich browns, vibrant reds (think strawberry sauce!), and pops of pastel thanks to whipped cream. Don’t be afraid to mix patterns. A waffle print with a sprinkle polka dot? Absolutely.
* **Inspiration Library:** Ditch the architectural digests. Fill it with vintage cookbooks, quirky diner menus, travel photos of charming European cafes, and *especially* pictures of gloriously imperfect waffles.

**II. The Space: Functionality with a Flourish**

This is where things get real. You need functionality, but it can’t feel…clinical.

* **The Waffle Imperfection Nook (See Blueprint -** [BLUEPRINT](https://www.reddit.com/r/YourWaffleShop/comments/1nmwopd/waffle_imperfection_nook/) **):** This is CRUCIAL. A dedicated area for experimenting with imperfect designs. Think deliberately mismatched chairs, slightly crooked artwork, and a wobbly table. It reminds designers that flaws are beautiful.
   * **Materials:** Reclaimed wood, exposed brick, textured plaster. Nothing too slick.
   * **Ventilation:** Essential. Especially if you’re experimenting with waffle-infused air fresheners (a highly recommended venture).
   * **Load-Bearing Calculations:** Seriously. Waffle-edge flooring *looks* amazing, but it needs structural support. Don’t skip this step.
* **The Sprinkle Station:** A dedicated zone for sprinkle brainstorming. Jar after jar of every color, shape, and size imaginable. Include a ""Sprinkle Inspiration"" wall with patterns and combinations.
* **The Syrup Sensory Lab:** Test different syrup viscosities, flavors, and aromas. A dark, soundproof booth is recommended for focused syrup contemplation.
* **Digital Design Area:** Okay, fine. You need computers. But surround them with comfortable, non-ergonomic chairs (embracing the casual vibe) and decorate with waffle-themed artwork.

**III. The Vibe: Fueling Creativity**

* **Music:** A curated playlist of upbeat, feel-good tunes. Think classic diner songs, indie pop, and maybe a little bit of Oogway Ascends for Zen moments. (See previous playlist for inspiration.)
* **Snack Supply:** Constant access to waffles, obviously. But also fruit, pastries, and plenty of coffee. A well-fed designer is a creative designer.
* **Butter-Inspired Ambiance:** Subtle, but important. Warm lighting, soft textures, and a lingering aroma of vanilla and melted butter.

**IV. A Word From Butter (Seriously)**

Don’t get caught up in sterile precision. Embrace the spontaneity. Trust your instincts. And always, *always* remember that the goal is to create a space that feels welcoming, joyful, and utterly delicious. Because that’s what waffle shops are all about.

**(P.S. WonderWaffle insists you include a mandatory sprinkle shower in every design. Don’t argue. It's for the best.)**",1,1758476177.0,YourWaffleShop,0,1.0,False

Our kids are in a small private school. I was raised in public schools, and the level of toxicity from some of the parents is alarming to me. It’s really augmented by the small class size, he has under 20 kids in his grade. I’m seeing things that don’t shock me (toxic striving, addiction), but the school enrollment has dropped quite a bit, and my 6th grader is now in a 17 kid class where he has a “frenemy” kind of situation going on. He’s generally got that handled, but I’m not loving the social situation at this place and our options locally are limited. We are looking for what to do next year, I don’t think we will stay. 

Here’s what I need advice on. Another mom asked us to have dinner and a get together the other night, and we did. It started fine, but she did get into talking about issues they were having with other families in front of the kids and I steered it toward a topic for coffee. A few days later, she called me and for about two hours (I don’t talk to anyone for two hours, it was a lot of time) and told me about all of these issues she was having with the other parents (for instance a group of them at the last minute declined her child’s birthday and held their own party at a local place for no occasion, posted it on social media so that the girl would know that’s what they did). While I get that the parent behavior is atrocious, what struck me is that this woman was asking for me to save her while also admitting that she’d lined her child up for this scenario with the exact same people on both Halloween and the child’s birthday for two years with the same result. Not to mention having the kid on social media at 10. I’m horrified at her lack of judgement, and that she’s playing a victim when it’s pretty clear how several of these families operate. She has some ownership here too. I didn’t miss that at no point in the last two years did she include my child in any of these events, despite him including her in his. I asked  (kindly and with genuine curiosity) why my kid wasn’t included and she just said it was a huge oversight, twice. I really have a hard time believing that😂. I truly would have been fine with anything honest, but she tripped up her words a ton trying to answer, and I felt dismay.

I know I need to find a new school for my child. He’s got friends outside of school in sports, but I need a better environment for him socially. The parental behavior is showing up in the kids. With this woman- my kids want to hang out with her daughter but I’m so apprehensive. I don’t think the mom or daughter have the tools to love themselves, much less anyone else. I am not a helicopter parent at all, I am guiding my child but letting him handle things (which he is doing beautifully), but I do feel protective of him on this given that the dynamics are getting worse and the last two years have been rough. She’s on me for getting together weekly and I feel a lot of apprehension. She had a lot of time to foster a friendship if she wanted to, and I have a tough time trusting someone who would go back to someone if they truly did what she’s saying (which I can see them doing, I don’t think she’s making it up). I guess we can see her and refuse to talk about others when she goes there, but part of me sees it as an inevitable waste of time. I didn’t realize until her venting call that the whole time this person knew how lonely my child was at school they were knowingly not inviting him to events while coming to his. If I’m being petty, please call me on it. But I feel like the right move her is to remain cordial and keep these two at bay.",1,1758476175.0,AskParents,1,1.0,False

This is really long (sorry), so TLDR: my Fitbit shows the quality of my sleep has gone down considerably since stopping drinking and MJ. 

I am in my early 50s in good shape and health. I have had a couple/few drinks every night for many, many years. It was part of my nightly wind-down routine: after dinner, hit the couch and watch some shows while I have 2-3 glasses of wine (used to be gin). Then I would take a single toke of MJ once in bed around 10:30pm. I would watch shows on my iPad until I fell asleep around 11:30pm. (I am so ashamed of myself after typing this out). 

It’s been a bit over a month since I stopped drinking and three weeks since I stopped MJ. I seem to be a creature of habit more than someone with addictive traits as I do not miss either at all; I have no desire for them. I also stopped the iPad in bed and now read (this has been a really nice change because I used to read quite a bit). 

I am falling asleep just fine, now around 10:45 - 11pm, and just wake up earlier. I notice dreams and when I stir/briefly wake  up more, which is understandable since I am no longer heavily-medicated. I’ve had occasional bouts where I wake up much earlier than I want, but get about 7 hours overall (which is ok by me). 

When I get out of bed, I generally feel ok. I’d had my nightly drinks for so long I didn’t realize how bad they made me feel in the mornings. Not something I would have described as a hangover then, just taking over an hour with some coffee to feel relatively normal. But in hindsight, I was cloudy-headed and sluggish for a few hours really. 

According to my Fitbit (yes, I am well aware they are unreliable for sleep tracking, but I’ve been using one for years and think it gives an overall accurate assessment of my sleep quality), my score has dropped from an average of about 70-72 from past years, to 60 since my changes. It shows I am getting minimal deep (39 mins) or REM (14 mins) sleep. 

Nothing else in my life has changed: same stress levels, activity, etc. I am confounded by this. Again, I don’t feel terrible when I wake up, but I do feel I am missing out on some of the restorative aspects of sleep (IOW, I feel like I should feel more rested/better than I do). I like things much better the way they are now; I feel like I am sharper and have more control over my life but I would like to get this sorted. 

Anyone have thoughts on this? Think maybe I just need to give it more time and things will settle?",1,1758476055.0,sleep,1,1.0,False

Not the kind you feel when you’re dreading emails or traffic—but the kind where you’re not sure if your stomach is going to cooperate. Some days it was bloating, other days it was cramping, and sometimes it was just an overall heaviness that followed me no matter what I ate.

I tried the usual fixes—cutting dairy, skipping bread, even those chalky probiotic drinks that promised the world. Nothing stuck. What frustrated me most was how unpredictable it was. One Saturday I’d be out enjoying a farmers’ market stroll, and the next weekend I’d cancel plans because I just didn’t feel “right.”

[That’s when I came across PrimeBiome, a daily probiotic designed to balance gut health. I wasn’t looking for a miracle—I just wanted consistency, a sense of control over my own body. So I gave it a try.](https://freezegluco.com/PrimeBiome.html)

The first week felt uneventful, but by the second, I noticed something small: I could finish my morning coffee without discomfort. By the third week, the afternoon bloating that used to creep in after lunch was noticeably less. What surprised me most was the mental clarity that followed—I didn’t realize how much brain fog was tied to how my gut felt.

Six weeks in, the changes were undeniable. I went on a road trip with friends down to San Antonio and didn’t once worry about where the nearest bathroom was. I said “yes” to spontaneous dinners without scanning menus like a detective. Even at home, I felt lighter, more comfortable in my own skin.

What I gained wasn’t just a calmer stomach—it was freedom. Freedom to plan less, to live more, and to enjoy my days without second-guessing every bite. And for me, that shift has been nothing short of life-giving.",1,1758476030.0,TriedAndRated,0,1.0,False

Quick recap from last week: I just assaulted Randall in his office, broke his nose (no regrets), and learned that management has been sacrificing us employees to Route 333 for years. Older truckers were getting intentionally lane-locked so us newer truckers could travel freely. 

Oh, and it turned out headquarters was located on the edge of Route 333 this whole time.

Also, something was lurking outside in the darkness.

Am I missing anything?

“Whose dumb idea was it to build the truck yard on the highway?” I whispered.

Randall and I crouched behind a desk in the main lobby. The only light came from the blue screen of the receptionist’s monitor and stars barely visible above the far-off treeline. The blackness beyond the front windows was perfectly tranquil.

*For now.*

“That’s what you’re worried about?” Randall hissed.

“If whatever’s out there is going to eat us, I’d at least enjoy the comfort of blaming somebody.”

“It had to be this way. Nothing can communicate across the barrier between Route 333 and the real world. This is the only place dispatch could radio you on the road.”

“Funny. I just spent a week without a radio, and I’m fine.”

“Not to mention, we’d have nowhere to store the impossibilities.”

“What? Is there some sort of secret bunker under the ground?” I laughed.

He remained silent.

“Oh my gosh, there *is* a secret bunker!”

“The longer the impossibilities spend in the real world, the more they unravel it. I risk my life every day coming here to work. You should be grateful.”

“Oh yeah. Positively weeping with gratitude―quick question, what was that you said earlier about sacrificing us to the road?”

Randall made a low guttural noise and whirled on me. “*Look,* Brendon! I get that you’re angry. I do, okay? And yet, right now, I’m the one with a messed up nose, and somehow I’m setting that aside, because there is a *thing* outside. Likely, it’s searching for a way to cut all electricity. Pretty soon, it will find one. Let’s postpone discussing how much we hate each other until after, yeah?”

It was nothing I hadn't already gotten from Randall for weeks. Postponing. Redirecting my questions. False promises of answers that he would never give. As it happened, though, this was the one time that he might actually have a point.

I forced myself to exhale. My shoulders relaxed. “What do we need to do?”

“The lights outside. We have to get them back on. The breaker must have tripped when janitorial was here earlier with the vacuums. It should be self-resetting, but I’m guessing it’s broken. We’ll have to manually do it.”

“We don’t, like, check that regularly? This seems like a big deal.”

“Usually yes, but we’ve been scrambling to find a replacement for you this week.”

I held back multiple snide comments. “Fine. A breaker isn’t bad. Where’s the control panel for the streetlights?”

“Behind the building. Outside.”

“Delightful. And we can’t just cross over to the regular world until the morning? Fix the lights then? We’re already near the boundary.”

He shook his head. “It could follow us over. The road-dwellers don’t have an issue passing across. It just usually takes them a while to get here. The only thing keeping this one from leaving years ago was the streetlights. If we don’t get them back on, it will escape.”

Still crouching, Randall pulled open the drawers of the receptionist desk one by one and rifled through them. He pulled something small and cylindrical from one and handed it to me. A penlight.

“You shouldn’t need it, but just in case. Light should keep it at bay.”

I clicked it on and off. A thin light lit up the space beneath the desk. Not much but something.

“When I say go, you turn on the lights in here,” he said. “It should get distracted watching you, but it shouldn’t be able to attack while they’re on. I’ll run for the back.”

The plan sounded reasonable enough. I nearly said *yes.* Me in here, in the light? Safe? Sounded great. 

And yet…

“You distract it,” I said. “I’ll go flip the breaker.”

“Now’s not the time to be noble, Brendon.”

I let out a laugh the temperature of ice. “I trust big insurance more than I trust you. If I’m the one flipping the breaker, I know you’re incentivized to keep me alive until that thing’s gone. Otherwise, you’ll sacrifice me to save yourself.”

“You’d be safer in here.”

“So you say, but there’s always a catch with you, isn’t there?”

“You don’t even know where the fuse box is.”

“I do actually. I notice things. Just give me the keys.” I glanced purposefully where they dangled from his belt.

“Why do you have to make everything―”

We cut off when, for one brief *glorious* moment, the outside streetlights came on all by themselves. The illumination through the windows grew brighter and brighter.

*No*, I realized. *Not streetlights at all.*

Headlights.

A red SUV pulled into a spot near the doors. Lights flooded the front lobby, then all at once, switched off, leaving us momentarily blind. A car door *thumped* closed. 

“*No.*” Beside me, Randall sprang for the lobby lights, but it was too late.

Gloria approached the entrance, fiddling with a set of keys. Before she could reach them, darkness congealed around her. It came from everywhere and nowhere at the same time, a cloud of dust suddenly sentient. She opened her mouth to scream, but no sound came out. Instead, the darkness poured down her throat like oil into the engine.

She scrabbled at her neck, but how did you fight the air itself? Her skin puffed outwards. She was a balloon filling with water. Gloria’s movements slowed, until she just stood there, arms outstretched, expression vacant. 

The lobby lights flashed on but too late. The blackness pouring into her had already been slowing.

The grinding began. 

As much as I hate it, there’s only one word that describes what came next with any sort of justice: *blender.* It was the crunching, whirring scream of solid things being made liquid. Like a blender, her outer body maintained its shape, even while the insides ground themselves up. Eventually, she turned to the side, opened her mouth, and released a long stream of what had *used* to be her insides. Red. Chunky. Fragments of splintered bone intermixed.

She straightened back into her original shape.

*It must be dark* *underneath that skin.* The new Gloria turned to us. Her eyelids were closed to hold out the light.

She drew out her keys.

“Go!” shouted Randall, but I needed no encouragement. I sprang at him, ripped his own keys from his belt loop, and dashed away. The lobby doors crashed open behind me. Predictably―because my luck is oh so wonderful―it was me the footsteps followed.

“Randall went the other way,” I called back helpfully.

It was a strange reversal of situations. Just minutes ago *I* was the one chasing someone down these stairs. Now, I was the one being chased up them. I must say, I preferred the former.

As I ran, I switched on all the lights. I didn’t care if the thing was now confined inside a body. It could still come out at any time.

The new Gloria seemed to have a similar idea. Behind me, glass shattered and hallways went black. My escape routes were shrinking.

“No really,” I called. “Randall’s a much easier a target. Even I can take him.”

She wasn’t interested.

I fumbled with the breakroom lightswitch. It took me too long to find it in the dim, and Gloria pounced at me. Her nails raked my face and arms. I tried to scramble away, but she wrapped herself around my leg. Her teeth sank into my calf.

“Mother trucker!” I kicked in her head―not *at* her head, mind you. *In.* It literally caved inwards.

For one, beautiful moment I thought I’d killed her. Then the dent popped right back out. *Right*. She was only skin now.

My pathways were limited now. I had to get outside. That much was obvious, but how? She was on my tail. The only other staircase to get downstairs would force me across already darkened hallways. My pulse pounded. My lungs begged. I couldn’t last much longer. I passed Randall’s office.

An idea struck me.

It was already dark in the room from when Randall had exploded the overhead lightbulb, but the hallway was illumination enough to ward off complete darkness. I flung myself at the desk.

*Where is it? Where is it…?*

Gloria rammed into me. I tried shoving her off, but her mouth latched onto my neck. She tore into my flesh. I bellowed, and collapsed―

*There!* 

Fallen underneath the desk, sprinkled with broken glass, was the boxcutter from earlier. I snatched it and stabbed backward at Gloria’s face. I pulled down with the clean ripping sensation of scissors through paper.

She fell off me, clasping at her head. Blackness writhed behind the gash in her face. Her hands pinched the skin, trying and failing to hold herself together. Roils of darkness spilled from the gaps. I drove the boxcutter into her leg and tore upwards. Her mouth opened, but no sound came out. There was nothing tangible beyond her open jaws. She clutched her leg too, but the endeavor was like keeping water in a Ziploc bag with multiple holes.

I didn’t wait to see what happened next.

No longer did I bother with the lights. My feet carried me through the hall, down the stairs, and out the back door.

There it was. The electrical box illuminated by an orange moon―a *false* moon I now knew.

My trembling hands fumbled with the ring of keys. Which was it?

I tried one. No use. I tried the next. Still, it didn’t work. Above me a window shattered. A cloud of dust exploded out into the night.

*Not yet!* I needed more time.

“Forget this.” I tossed the keys to the ground and yanked at the metal panel to the breaker box. Surely, I could tear the flimsy thing open. It rattled. It pried apart at my force…

The blackness descended on me.

I fumbled for my penlight and shone it out. The dim light did almost nothing. The cloud avoided the direct light, but there were so many angles, and I couldn’t cover all of them. It was no use.

My eyes squeezed shut. My mouth clamped down. I used my index fingers to plug my ears, and my thumbs to cover my nostrils. I waited for the force of a thousand pounds of sand to slam into me, but it never came. Instead, the dark was a breeze on my neck, lighter than pillow fluff. 

It had nowhere to enter, and yet it surrounded me. The coldness slithered around my hands, searching, hunting for a path *in.* It didn’t need to burrow into me; I got the sense it couldn’t. All it had to do was wait until I gave in and peeked with one eye or opened my mouth to breathe. 

For those of you out there who are experienced in the art of holding your breath, I applaud you. That’s never been my talent though. In high school, I joined the swim team for all of two weeks, before realizing that, *oh wait, humans don't actually have gills, thank you very much.*

On a good day, my record is maybe, *maybe,* a minute? Less perhaps? Believe me, during the few chances I've timed myself, I start out with good intentions―strength of will, fortitude of character, ‘what if there’s a flash flood in my apartment?’, etcetera―but it’s always somewhere around second forty I begin considering *alternative* ways to build character.

Even right then, with the embodiment of a blender congealing around me, I could feel myself slipping―and why did it matter? In the end, this being was the blackness that had existed since before our planet formed. It had waited a billion years to feel the warmth of living organs. No matter how long I lasted, it could last longer.

*Don’t.* 

*Don’t open your mouth.* 

*Do not breathe.*

And then, I did.

For one terrible moment, the coldness flooded in, past my lips and toward my throat. It thrummed with excitement. A vessel to move freely―it would take better care of me than the last one.

Lights exploded in front of me. The darkness burst outwards in all directions in a mad bid to escape. I gasped.

“The breaker!” Randall screamed. He gestured frantically from the cab of my own truck where he'd blasted the headlights.

I wasted no time. It took only two keys this time before the lock twisted and the panel flew open. As for the breakers, I flipped them all at once. Immediately, familiar streetlights flared to life, filling the entire truck yard with wonderful, life-sustaining light.

From there everything went hazy. Between the adrenaline, minutes without oxygen (okay, fifty seconds), and my sleep deprivation from the past week, reality turned kaleidoscopic. I do remember an arm around my shoulder as someone led me inside and up the stairs.

“My office!” they said.

Guess he found Gloria.

“I did try to help her, you know.”

I looked up from the breakroom table. It was several hours later, and I sipped a cup of coffee. I hadn't wanted to risk the drive home. Things hadn't felt quite *real* enough to trust myself behind a wheel, so I’d slept a few hours in my rig. Now, it was early morning.

Randall stood in the doorway. His nose was splinted from what I could tell with some sort of aluminum strip. It reminded me of those metallic bracelets from elementary school that curl when you slap them around your wrist but go rigid when you straighten them.

“I saw,” I told him. “There was nothing you could have done for Gloria. She arrived too quickly.”

“Not Gloria. Tiff.”

He poured himself a cup from my coffee pot, then immediately spit it out. “This is practically water.”

“It’s my third cup. Thought I should slow down.”

He dumped it, set a new batch to brew, and took a seat across from me.

“We were drivers at the same time,” he said. “Me and Tiff.  Bet you didn’t know that, huh? That I used to be a driver too. All of us were at one point. Even Gloria. It’s not just like you can hire somebody to do what I do right off the bat. How would you ever explain all of…*this* to them.” He waved his hand vaguely in front of him as if to imply I should know exactly what ‘*this’* was that he was referring to.

I did. To be fair.

“We’d chat over the radio,” he continued. “Even after I moved into a dispatch position. Sometimes for hours. When she lane-locked, I was just like you. It tore me up. I searched for ways to get her out, but―”

“We’re not doing this,” I said.

“Doing what?”

“You’re trying to humanize yourself. Don’t. We’re not chummy because we escaped the same traumatic event. Just because you can prove you’ve ever had feelings doesn’t excuse what you and the rest of management are doing, so stop. Just stop.”

Randall stared at me. He shut off the gurgling coffee pot, sat back down, and sipped from his own mug in contemplation.

“Fine then.” The corners of his lips pulled into a sneer, and he slammed his elbows on the table. “*Here’s* how things are. You saw that thing out there? The one that turned Gloria into a human smoothie? There’s hundreds of those things out there in the real world, some sentient, some not, but all that destroy just as easily. There’s no killing them. There’s no reasoning with them or locking them up. There’s only the road.”

He leaned toward me with an utter look of disgust. “It’s wrong what we do. It’s unjustifiable, and it’s despicable. When Route 333 marks one of you to get lane-locked, we do nothing to stop it. Sometimes, we even encourage that person to go on extra long hauls to help things along, because we’ve learned if the road doesn’t get what it wants, there are consequences for the rest of you. It’s abhorrent what we do. That’s what I’ve heard for years, but you know the one thing I haven’t ever heard? A better solution.” 

He tilted his head. “Please, Brendon, do tell me yours?”

I stayed quiet.

“Thought so.”

I wanted to rage like last night. I wanted to scream and threaten and punch. All the fight was gone, though. I was exhausted. The hate simmering in me toward Randall―I couldn’t seem to locate it anymore.

He paused at the door. “You’re right. We aren’t chummy now. I don’t expect you to forgive me. I certainly don’t plan to forgive you.” He pointed at his nose. “But I will ask that you stay as a driver for a while longer. You know what’s at stake now. Don’t give up.”

He left.

I laughed.

Don’t give up?

Randall clearly had. Tiff had too. Everybody I knew seemed to have given up in some major way, and I was no exception. Taking this job was me doing that very thing in regards to my old life, so where did I go from here? How did I give up my ‘giving up’?

I couldn’t.

That was the truth of it. The choice wasn’t in my hands anymore. Even with this new, terrible knowledge, I simply had to stay. I had to find a better solution.

That’s what I’d announced to the road weeks ago, wasn’t it? That I would help Tiff―right before it attempted to drown me to prove a point. At the time I’d taken it as a threat, and it was. Of course it was. But it was something else too.

Why would Route 333 have cared to warn me off unless there was something to warn me off *from*? This was Randall all over again. I’d only known he was hiding some terrible secret because it was obvious he was also hiding *less* terrible things.

The road tried to stop me from helping Tiff because there was, in fact, a way to do so, and I was close.

[Pineal Guardian X Review](https://preview.redd.it/7qpjoyb5zjqf1.jpg?width=752&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=40862575e2a80feab1e2e7b028f3f5483192753a)

I used to wake up groggy, dragging myself out of bed like I’d been hit by a truck. The brain fog was relentless. I’d sit at my desk staring at the screen, coffee in hand, but nothing clicked. Deadlines slipped, ideas felt flat, and the worst part? I knew I was capable of so much more.

Then I stumbled on something that claimed to unlock focus and clarity by supporting the pineal gland. Skeptical? Absolutely. But I was desperate. I’d tried the typical hacks—endless nootropics, cold showers, meditation apps—but nothing stuck. So I decided to give it a shot.

The first week, I noticed subtle shifts. Sleep felt deeper, not just longer. I’d wake up before my alarm and actually feel rested. That alone felt like a breakthrough. By week two, the fog started lifting. Ideas flowed. I could focus for hours without distraction. My productivity didn’t just improve—it doubled.

What caught me off guard were the side benefits. My mood stabilized. Stress that used to trigger anxiety just rolled off. Conversations with colleagues felt sharper, more engaging. I started remembering names, details, small things that make people feel seen. Those little wins stacked into big ones.

Here’s the truth: **mental clarity, sharper memory, improved focus, and deep restorative sleep** aren’t luxuries. They’re leverage. Once I got those locked in, my work output skyrocketed. I closed deals faster, wrote cleaner, hit deadlines early. Clients noticed. My income grew. And the kicker? It didn’t feel like effort anymore.

I’m not here to pitch magic. But I’ll say this: **when you optimize your brain health and support natural detox, you put yourself lightyears ahead of the competition.** Most people will never even scratch the surface of what their mind can do.

Today, I run my mornings without caffeine dependency. I sleep like a rock. I focus like a laser. That shift cracked open a new chapter of success I didn’t think was possible just months ago. If someone had told me a simple step like this could change my trajectory, I would’ve laughed. Now I’m living proof.

What surprised me wasn’t just the results—it was the process. Here’s what I noticed step by step.

The first changes hit my **sleep cycle**. Instead of tossing around at night, I’d drift into deep rest quickly. I started dreaming vividly again, something I hadn’t experienced in years. Waking up with that clarity was a game changer. My mornings shifted from dragging myself out of bed to actually feeling ready to tackle the day. That alone set the tone for better focus and sharper thinking.

By the second week, the **brain fog began to lift**. It wasn’t like flipping a switch; it was gradual but undeniable. I’d sit down to work and actually finish tasks without wandering off into distraction. Projects that used to take me hours were done in half the time. That kind of **laser focus** is rare—and once you feel it, you don’t want to go back.

Then came the unexpected: **stress relief**. I didn’t realize how much background anxiety I carried until it wasn’t there anymore. Things that usually triggered me just… didn’t. I handled tough conversations calmly, made decisions faster, and kept momentum even when the pressure was on. That mental edge gave me confidence in every area of life.

And here’s the kicker—**memory and recall shot through the roof**. Names, numbers, details that used to slip my mind started sticking. In meetings, I was the guy remembering specifics everyone else forgot. That small edge created big wins: more respect, more trust, more opportunities.

So how did it feel? Imagine your mind as a dusty window. Every week, it’s like wiping away another layer until the glass is crystal clear. That’s how **mental clarity** felt for me. My creativity spiked, my energy felt clean, and I wasn’t relying on caffeine to stay sharp anymore.

The truth is, optimizing your **pineal gland health** has ripple effects you don’t expect. Better sleep fuels productivity. Less stress fuels confidence. Sharper focus fuels success. And all of it stacks.

Looking back, I can say this wasn’t just another supplement I tried and forgot about. It was a reset button that opened up capacity I didn’t know I had. **When your brain is operating at its peak, everything else falls into place—your work, your relationships, your growth.**

**Does Pineal Guardian X really work?**  
From my experience, yes. I noticed real changes in sleep quality, mental clarity, and daily focus. It’s not an overnight miracle, but over weeks of consistent use, the effects stacked—clearer thinking, sharper memory, and more balanced energy.

**How long does it take to see results with Pineal Guardian X?**  
I personally felt small shifts in the first week, especially in sleep and energy. By the second week, brain fog lifted and focus improved. Most people report the best results after consistent daily use for at least 30–60 days.

**Is Pineal Guardian X safe to use?**  
It’s a natural brain health supplement with ingredients like spirulina, chlorella, lion’s mane, and ginkgo biloba. I didn’t experience side effects, but as with any supplement, it’s smart to check with your doctor if you have conditions or take medication.

**What benefits can I expect from Pineal Guardian X?**  
The core benefits I experienced included deeper sleep, improved focus, reduced stress, and sharper memory. Over time, this translated into higher productivity and a big boost in overall mental clarity.

**Does Pineal Guardian X help with sleep?**  
Yes—this was one of the first changes I noticed. I fell asleep faster, dreamed more vividly, and woke up refreshed. A balanced pineal gland is tied to melatonin production, so supporting it naturally improves the sleep cycle.

**Can Pineal Guardian X improve focus and productivity?**  
Absolutely. Once the brain fog cleared, I could work for hours without distraction. Tasks that used to drain me felt effortless. It gave me that mental edge I needed to perform at my best.

**How do you take Pineal Guardian X?**  
It comes as a simple liquid formula. I took it daily in the morning, which worked best for focus and energy throughout the day.

**Is Pineal Guardian X worth the investment?**  
For me, the answer is yes. The gains in mental clarity, reduced stress, and productivity far outweighed the cost. It didn’t just improve my health—it had a ripple effect on my career, finances, and confidence.",1,1758475919.0,ReviewDaily,0,1.0,False

Quick recap from last week: I just assaulted Randall in his office, broke his nose (no regrets), and learned that management has been sacrificing us employees to Route 333 for years. Older truckers were getting intentionally lane-locked so us newer truckers could travel freely. 

Oh, and it turned out headquarters was located on the edge of Route 333 this whole time.

Also, something was lurking outside in the darkness.

Am I missing anything?

“Whose dumb idea was it to build the truck yard on the highway?” I whispered.

Randall and I crouched behind a desk in the main lobby. The only light came from the blue screen of the receptionist’s monitor and stars barely visible above the far-off treeline. The blackness beyond the front windows was perfectly tranquil.

*For now.*

“That’s what you’re worried about?” Randall hissed.

“If whatever’s out there is going to eat us, I’d at least enjoy the comfort of blaming somebody.”

“It had to be this way. Nothing can communicate across the barrier between Route 333 and the real world. This is the only place dispatch could radio you on the road.”

“Funny. I just spent a week without a radio, and I’m fine.”

“Not to mention, we’d have nowhere to store the impossibilities.”

“What? Is there some sort of secret bunker under the ground?” I laughed.

He remained silent.

“Oh my gosh, there *is* a secret bunker!”

“The longer the impossibilities spend in the real world, the more they unravel it. I risk my life every day coming here to work. You should be grateful.”

“Oh yeah. Positively weeping with gratitude―quick question, what was that you said earlier about sacrificing us to the road?”

Randall made a low guttural noise and whirled on me. “*Look,* Brendon! I get that you’re angry. I do, okay? And yet, right now, I’m the one with a messed up nose, and somehow I’m setting that aside, because there is a *thing* outside. Likely, it’s searching for a way to cut all electricity. Pretty soon, it will find one. Let’s postpone discussing how much we hate each other until after, yeah?”

It was nothing I hadn't already gotten from Randall for weeks. Postponing. Redirecting my questions. False promises of answers that he would never give. As it happened, though, this was the one time that he might actually have a point.

I forced myself to exhale. My shoulders relaxed. “What do we need to do?”

“The lights outside. We have to get them back on. The breaker must have tripped when janitorial was here earlier with the vacuums. It should be self-resetting, but I’m guessing it’s broken. We’ll have to manually do it.”

“We don’t, like, check that regularly? This seems like a big deal.”

“Usually yes, but we’ve been scrambling to find a replacement for you this week.”

I held back multiple snide comments. “Fine. A breaker isn’t bad. Where’s the control panel for the streetlights?”

“Behind the building. Outside.”

“Delightful. And we can’t just cross over to the regular world until the morning? Fix the lights then? We’re already near the boundary.”

He shook his head. “It could follow us over. The road-dwellers don’t have an issue passing across. It just usually takes them a while to get here. The only thing keeping this one from leaving years ago was the streetlights. If we don’t get them back on, it will escape.”

Still crouching, Randall pulled open the drawers of the receptionist desk one by one and rifled through them. He pulled something small and cylindrical from one and handed it to me. A penlight.

“You shouldn’t need it, but just in case. Light should keep it at bay.”

I clicked it on and off. A thin light lit up the space beneath the desk. Not much but something.

“When I say go, you turn on the lights in here,” he said. “It should get distracted watching you, but it shouldn’t be able to attack while they’re on. I’ll run for the back.”

The plan sounded reasonable enough. I nearly said *yes.* Me in here, in the light? Safe? Sounded great. 

And yet…

“You distract it,” I said. “I’ll go flip the breaker.”

“Now’s not the time to be noble, Brendon.”

I let out a laugh the temperature of ice. “I trust big insurance more than I trust you. If I’m the one flipping the breaker, I know you’re incentivized to keep me alive until that thing’s gone. Otherwise, you’ll sacrifice me to save yourself.”

“You’d be safer in here.”

“So you say, but there’s always a catch with you, isn’t there?”

“You don’t even know where the fuse box is.”

“I do actually. I notice things. Just give me the keys.” I glanced purposefully where they dangled from his belt.

“Why do you have to make everything―”

We cut off when, for one brief *glorious* moment, the outside streetlights came on all by themselves. The illumination through the windows grew brighter and brighter.

*No*, I realized. *Not streetlights at all.*

Headlights.

A red SUV pulled into a spot near the doors. Lights flooded the front lobby, then all at once, switched off, leaving us momentarily blind. A car door *thumped* closed. 

“*No.*” Beside me, Randall sprang for the lobby lights, but it was too late.

Gloria approached the entrance, fiddling with a set of keys. Before she could reach them, darkness congealed around her. It came from everywhere and nowhere at the same time, a cloud of dust suddenly sentient. She opened her mouth to scream, but no sound came out. Instead, the darkness poured down her throat like oil into the engine.

She scrabbled at her neck, but how did you fight the air itself? Her skin puffed outwards. She was a balloon filling with water. Gloria’s movements slowed, until she just stood there, arms outstretched, expression vacant. 

The lobby lights flashed on but too late. The blackness pouring into her had already been slowing.

The grinding began. 

As much as I hate it, there’s only one word that describes what came next with any sort of justice: *blender.* It was the crunching, whirring scream of solid things being made liquid. Like a blender, her outer body maintained its shape, even while the insides ground themselves up. Eventually, she turned to the side, opened her mouth, and released a long stream of what had *used* to be her insides. Red. Chunky. Fragments of splintered bone intermixed.

She straightened back into her original shape.

*It must be dark* *underneath that skin.* The new Gloria turned to us. Her eyelids were closed to hold out the light.

She drew out her keys.

“Go!” shouted Randall, but I needed no encouragement. I sprang at him, ripped his own keys from his belt loop, and dashed away. The lobby doors crashed open behind me. Predictably―because my luck is oh so wonderful―it was me the footsteps followed.

“Randall went the other way,” I called back helpfully.

It was a strange reversal of situations. Just minutes ago *I* was the one chasing someone down these stairs. Now, I was the one being chased up them. I must say, I preferred the former.

As I ran, I switched on all the lights. I didn’t care if the thing was now confined inside a body. It could still come out at any time.

The new Gloria seemed to have a similar idea. Behind me, glass shattered and hallways went black. My escape routes were shrinking.

“No really,” I called. “Randall’s a much easier a target. Even I can take him.”

She wasn’t interested.

I fumbled with the breakroom lightswitch. It took me too long to find it in the dim, and Gloria pounced at me. Her nails raked my face and arms. I tried to scramble away, but she wrapped herself around my leg. Her teeth sank into my calf.

“Mother trucker!” I kicked in her head―not *at* her head, mind you. *In.* It literally caved inwards.

For one, beautiful moment I thought I’d killed her. Then the dent popped right back out. *Right*. She was only skin now.

My pathways were limited now. I had to get outside. That much was obvious, but how? She was on my tail. The only other staircase to get downstairs would force me across already darkened hallways. My pulse pounded. My lungs begged. I couldn’t last much longer. I passed Randall’s office.

An idea struck me.

It was already dark in the room from when Randall had exploded the overhead lightbulb, but the hallway was illumination enough to ward off complete darkness. I flung myself at the desk.

*Where is it? Where is it…?*

Gloria rammed into me. I tried shoving her off, but her mouth latched onto my neck. She tore into my flesh. I bellowed, and collapsed―

*There!* 

Fallen underneath the desk, sprinkled with broken glass, was the boxcutter from earlier. I snatched it and stabbed backward at Gloria’s face. I pulled down with the clean ripping sensation of scissors through paper.

She fell off me, clasping at her head. Blackness writhed behind the gash in her face. Her hands pinched the skin, trying and failing to hold herself together. Roils of darkness spilled from the gaps. I drove the boxcutter into her leg and tore upwards. Her mouth opened, but no sound came out. There was nothing tangible beyond her open jaws. She clutched her leg too, but the endeavor was like keeping water in a Ziploc bag with multiple holes.

I didn’t wait to see what happened next.

No longer did I bother with the lights. My feet carried me through the hall, down the stairs, and out the back door.

There it was. The electrical box illuminated by an orange moon―a *false* moon I now knew.

My trembling hands fumbled with the ring of keys. Which was it?

I tried one. No use. I tried the next. Still, it didn’t work. Above me a window shattered. A cloud of dust exploded out into the night.

*Not yet!* I needed more time.

“Forget this.” I tossed the keys to the ground and yanked at the metal panel to the breaker box. Surely, I could tear the flimsy thing open. It rattled. It pried apart at my force…

The blackness descended on me.

I fumbled for my penlight and shone it out. The dim light did almost nothing. The cloud avoided the direct light, but there were so many angles, and I couldn’t cover all of them. It was no use.

My eyes squeezed shut. My mouth clamped down. I used my index fingers to plug my ears, and my thumbs to cover my nostrils. I waited for the force of a thousand pounds of sand to slam into me, but it never came. Instead, the dark was a breeze on my neck, lighter than pillow fluff. 

It had nowhere to enter, and yet it surrounded me. The coldness slithered around my hands, searching, hunting for a path *in.* It didn’t need to burrow into me; I got the sense it couldn’t. All it had to do was wait until I gave in and peeked with one eye or opened my mouth to breathe. 

For those of you out there who are experienced in the art of holding your breath, I applaud you. That’s never been my talent though. In high school, I joined the swim team for all of two weeks, before realizing that, *oh wait, humans don't actually have gills, thank you very much.*

On a good day, my record is maybe, *maybe,* a minute? Less perhaps? Believe me, during the few chances I've timed myself, I start out with good intentions―strength of will, fortitude of character, ‘what if there’s a flash flood in my apartment?’, etcetera―but it’s always somewhere around second forty I begin considering *alternative* ways to build character.

Even right then, with the embodiment of a blender congealing around me, I could feel myself slipping―and why did it matter? In the end, this being was the blackness that had existed since before our planet formed. It had waited a billion years to feel the warmth of living organs. No matter how long I lasted, it could last longer.

*Don’t.* 

*Don’t open your mouth.* 

*Do not breathe.*

And then, I did.

For one terrible moment, the coldness flooded in, past my lips and toward my throat. It thrummed with excitement. A vessel to move freely―it would take better care of me than the last one.

Lights exploded in front of me. The darkness burst outwards in all directions in a mad bid to escape. I gasped.

“The breaker!” Randall screamed. He gestured frantically from the cab of my own truck where he'd blasted the headlights.

I wasted no time. It took only two keys this time before the lock twisted and the panel flew open. As for the breakers, I flipped them all at once. Immediately, familiar streetlights flared to life, filling the entire truck yard with wonderful, life-sustaining light.

From there everything went hazy. Between the adrenaline, minutes without oxygen (okay, fifty seconds), and my sleep deprivation from the past week, reality turned kaleidoscopic. I do remember an arm around my shoulder as someone led me inside and up the stairs.

“My office!” they said.

Guess he found Gloria.

“I did try to help her, you know.”

I looked up from the breakroom table. It was several hours later, and I sipped a cup of coffee. I hadn't wanted to risk the drive home. Things hadn't felt quite *real* enough to trust myself behind a wheel, so I’d slept a few hours in my rig. Now, it was early morning.

Randall stood in the doorway. His nose was splinted from what I could tell with some sort of aluminum strip. It reminded me of those metallic bracelets from elementary school that curl when you slap them around your wrist but go rigid when you straighten them.

“I saw,” I told him. “There was nothing you could have done for Gloria. She arrived too quickly.”

“Not Gloria. Tiff.”

He poured himself a cup from my coffee pot, then immediately spit it out. “This is practically water.”

“It’s my third cup. Thought I should slow down.”

He dumped it, set a new batch to brew, and took a seat across from me.

“We were drivers at the same time,” he said. “Me and Tiff.  Bet you didn’t know that, huh? That I used to be a driver too. All of us were at one point. Even Gloria. It’s not just like you can hire somebody to do what I do right off the bat. How would you ever explain all of…*this* to them.” He waved his hand vaguely in front of him as if to imply I should know exactly what ‘*this’* was that he was referring to.

I did. To be fair.

“We’d chat over the radio,” he continued. “Even after I moved into a dispatch position. Sometimes for hours. When she lane-locked, I was just like you. It tore me up. I searched for ways to get her out, but―”

“We’re not doing this,” I said.

“Doing what?”

“You’re trying to humanize yourself. Don’t. We’re not chummy because we escaped the same traumatic event. Just because you can prove you’ve ever had feelings doesn’t excuse what you and the rest of management are doing, so stop. Just stop.”

Randall stared at me. He shut off the gurgling coffee pot, sat back down, and sipped from his own mug in contemplation.

“Fine then.” The corners of his lips pulled into a sneer, and he slammed his elbows on the table. “*Here’s* how things are. You saw that thing out there? The one that turned Gloria into a human smoothie? There’s hundreds of those things out there in the real world, some sentient, some not, but all that destroy just as easily. There’s no killing them. There’s no reasoning with them or locking them up. There’s only the road.”

He leaned toward me with an utter look of disgust. “It’s wrong what we do. It’s unjustifiable, and it’s despicable. When Route 333 marks one of you to get lane-locked, we do nothing to stop it. Sometimes, we even encourage that person to go on extra long hauls to help things along, because we’ve learned if the road doesn’t get what it wants, there are consequences for the rest of you. It’s abhorrent what we do. That’s what I’ve heard for years, but you know the one thing I haven’t ever heard? A better solution.” 

He tilted his head. “Please, Brendon, do tell me yours?”

I stayed quiet.

“Thought so.”

I wanted to rage like last night. I wanted to scream and threaten and punch. All the fight was gone, though. I was exhausted. The hate simmering in me toward Randall―I couldn’t seem to locate it anymore.

He paused at the door. “You’re right. We aren’t chummy now. I don’t expect you to forgive me. I certainly don’t plan to forgive you.” He pointed at his nose. “But I will ask that you stay as a driver for a while longer. You know what’s at stake now. Don’t give up.”

He left.

I laughed.

Don’t give up?

Randall clearly had. Tiff had too. Everybody I knew seemed to have given up in some major way, and I was no exception. Taking this job was me doing that very thing in regards to my old life, so where did I go from here? How did I give up my ‘giving up’?

I couldn’t.

That was the truth of it. The choice wasn’t in my hands anymore. Even with this new, terrible knowledge, I simply had to stay. I had to find a better solution.

That’s what I’d announced to the road weeks ago, wasn’t it? That I would help Tiff―right before it attempted to drown me to prove a point. At the time I’d taken it as a threat, and it was. Of course it was. But it was something else too.

Why would Route 333 have cared to warn me off unless there was something to warn me off *from*? This was Randall all over again. I’d only known he was hiding some terrible secret because it was obvious he was also hiding *less* terrible things.

The road tried to stop me from helping Tiff because there was, in fact, a way to do so, and I was close.

It’s almost the feeling of having done too many sit ups.  But I haven’t done any core work.

(Was of Tirz for 14-16mo.  Ranging from 2.5-7.5mg Very comfortably.  Had perhaps one instance of constipation before magnesium sorted that out.  Cycled off Tirz for 6 mo.)

This morning, i had 1/2 banana to have with morning vitamins and a sip of coffee.  But burped the banana within 15min.

I was wondering… could too large of portions make one feel uncomfortable high in the GI?

Tirz never had this feeling.  
What is the third mechanism of action with Reta.  Would it feel high in GI?

Could it be constipation?

Any feedback on a **high stomach muscle like knot**. would be appreciated…. Anyone similar?

Came out pretty decent. I may have overdone it with the bourbon. I also doubled the recipe to take into work, but instead of 24, I came out with almost 48 cupcakes! Fun times.

Ingredients
For the Cupcakes:

    ▢ 1½ cups all-purpose flour (180g)
    ▢ 3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
    ▢ 2 teaspoons baking powder
    ▢ ¼ teaspoon salt
    ▢ 2 ounces German Chocolate chopped (57g/ half of a 4oz bar)
    ▢ ¼ cup hot coffee (60mL)
    ▢ 6 tablespoons unsalted butter softened (84g)
    ▢ 1¼ cups granulated sugar (250g)
    ▢ 2 large eggs room temperature
    ▢ 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
    ▢ ½ cup whole milk room temperature, (120mL)
    ▢ ⅓ cup sour cream room temperature, (80g)

For the Frosting:

    ▢ 1 cup + 2 tablespoons packed light-brown sugar (250g)
    ▢ 1 12-ounce/ 355mL can evaporated milk
    ▢ 3 large egg yolks
    ▢ ¾ cup unsalted butter (170g)
    ▢ ¼ teaspoon salt
    ▢ 3⅔ cups sweetened flaked coconut (300g)
    ▢ 1½ cups pecans toasted and coarsely chopped (188g)
    ▢ 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
    ▢ 16 candied or toasted pecan halves for garnishing

For the Filling:

    ▢ 1 cup semisweet chocolate bars chopped (180g)
    ▢ ½ cup heavy cream (120mL)
    ▢ 1 tablespoon bourbon (optional)

Instructions
For the Cupcakes:

    Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C) and place oven racks in the upper and lower third of the oven. Add 16 cupcake liners to two 12-cup cupcake pans.
    Sift the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt into a medium bowl. Set aside.
    Place the chopped chocolate in a bowl and pour the hot coffee over top. Let it sit for a few minutes, then whisk to melt all of the chocolate. Set aside.
    In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or with a handheld electric mixer), beat the butter until smooth and creamy. Add the sugar and continue beating until the mixture is fluffy (this will take about three minutes). Stop and scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed.
    Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition.
    Add the vanilla extract and beat to combine. Then add the melted chocolate and coffee mixture, and beat until incorporated.
    In a small bowl, whisk to combine the milk and sour cream.
    Beating on low speed, add a third of the flour mixture, mixing just until combined. Add half of the sour cream mixture, beating just until combined. Continue alternating with another third of the flour, the rest of the sour cream, and finally the remaining flour.
    Divide the batter evenly among cupcake papers. Bake for about 18 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove from the oven and place on a wire rack to cool completely.

For the Frosting:

    In a medium saucepan, combine the sugar, milk, egg yolks, butter, and salt. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, for about 5 minutes, until the mixture begins to boil and thicken. Remove from the heat and stir in the coconut, pecans, and vanilla extract. Let cool until spreadable (about 30-60 minutes).

For the Ganache Filling:

    Place the chocolate in a heatproof bowl and set aside.
    Heat the cream in a small saucepan over medium heat, just until it begins to bubble (do not let it boil.) Pour the cream over the chocolate and allow it to sit for a few minutes. Whisk together until there are no lumps. Pour in the bourbon if using and whisk again.

For the Assembly:

    Use an apple corer to remove the center of each cupcake, being careful not to cut all of the way through to the bottom. Trim the bottom of the removed cupcake centers, leaving a ½-inch thick piece from the top. Set aside the top pieces.
    Fill the cored cupcake holes with a big spoonful of ganache. Top with the reserved pieces from the core.
    Cover the tops generously with coconut frosting. Drizzle with more ganache, and add a candied pecan to the top of each cupcake.",1,1758475081.0,Baking,1,1.0,False
1nmxpti,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1nmxpti/lily_angel/,Lily Angel,"Lils... you have no idea about this, but I've written this over and over in my mind, ever since I was young and dumb and decided to cut you off. I'm sorry that I was selfish. As twisted as it was, I thought that I was protecting you from the shadow of who I really was, all of the shit that I had actually been through. I thought that you were to young to understand. I prayed you would never understand. But I know that my actions put you through hell. I've been looking for you, quite discreetly, for a long while now. I've been too much of a coward to post this or to contact your family. I'm scared that you still hate me. I'm scared that they hate me too. 

Even though it's been so many years... you're never too far from my mind. I still think about you all the time, still regret being such an ass. I dream of you, sometimes, you know. Sometimes you hate me, and yell at me for everything I put you through. Sometimes we make up, and you tell me that you understand, and even though we're both busy, we start making time for each other. 

The tears that you cried the last time you left my house? You don't know this, but I cried them too. After you left, I shut myself in my room and ugly cried for hours. I was selfish. I deserved that pain. You didn't. And when you left and brought Em to my door, it felt like I was being stabbed in the heart. I thought I was going to throw up. I wanted to push her. I wanted to snatch your hand and drag you back home and tell your family to keep you away from her. I wanted to grab you and pull you inside and lock the door. I wanted to scream, I wanted to cry, I wanted to tell you about everything she did to me. Instead, I convinced myself that you would be fine, that she would never do to you what she did to me. 

You don't know this, Lily. But I came out to her when I was 11, admitted that I had a crush on a girl in school. And from that point on, we were in this sick, twisted, abusive relationship type thing. She was blackmailing me Lily. And so, when I started high school, I cut everyone off. I tried to reinvent myself. But my mistake was that I didn't take you with me.I tried to convince myself that everyone was better off without me, anyway. And I hate this, but everyone else probably saw it coming. My brother did the same, on a random day years previous. I knew how much everyone hated him after, even though I kept trying to explain what he was going through. I knew that once I made my choice, everyone hated me too. They probably told you that it was always going to happen. That I had grown too old, and we were different. But Lily that could never be true. I've missed you ever since. I've wondered who I would be if I were smarter, stronger.

I was stupid. I thought I was doing the right thing. I didn't want you to see my depression. I was crying for hours every day. I knew that you or your siblings had to have seen how fucked up I was. The scars on my wrists, the way I would get all dizzy but refuse to eat. You shouldn't have seen any of that. 

But I guess I'll get on with this. I still miss you Lily. I always have. I'm so sorry I was never the friend that you needed. I wish I wouldn't have pushed you away. I still wonder where you are, how you're doing. I'm too scared to ask your family, but I've searched and searched, trying to find a social media account linked to your name. I've had no luck. I've wrestled and wrestled with the thought of messaging Chey, or Dakota, or even your mom, to ask about you. But I'm scared. Scared they must hate me, that you hate me. Scared that I'll find out that something bad happened. Scared that it could have been my fault. 

Lils, I don't ever expect you to see this, but I would do anything to have your friendship back. I've felt this way from the very beginning. It's become amplified from the moment you gave up. It's eaten away at me, haunted me everywhere I go. I have a better life now, but I don't know if that ever mattered, because it took way too long to get there, and I only want to know about yours. 

You'd be 18 now, I think. Maybe I'm a year off. I'm sorry. I wish I hadn't forgotten you, or tried to forget you, the way I did. When's your birthday, was it February 8th? I think it's somewhere around that time. It's funny, I actually am currently teaching people your age. And they feel like little kids to me. But you? You would always be a dear friend. You will always be more than a girl, more than a kid. I miss the way we used to play. My favorite was house, or vampires. I love the way we would always pick such similar names. Or the way we would mess around in the dead end. And that time we had a sleep over at your house, and I think it was Aries who was over too. We all had coffee, even though we were way too young. You made macaroni and cheese for breakfast, and it struck me as odd but it had never tasted so good. 

Even after all this time Lily, I remember. And contrary to what you may believe, I will never, ever forget. I don't know where you are, or if we could ever reconnect. But you will always be in my heart.

Labeling this strangers, because I don't have a right to call you a friend.

As you can see there have been significant relapses over the years (the dramatic 2020 drop was because of illness), and the averages don't show it, but I did go back over 300 at least short 2 periods. I got back on track eventually though. In 2017 I was tracking calories, but I stopped after a few years. I kinda figured what my problem was (overeating (especially dinner), eating evening snacks, soda with sugar, pastries with coffee at work). I did start biking to work, and nowadays I get in 7-8 hours of biking a week.

So I hit 100 lbs loss a few days ago, down below 227. My wife has been struggling with weight most of her life, and it is a sore subject for her. She's a at least 30 lbs heavier than me now, and I'm a foot taller than her ... When I told her about my 100 lbs milestone she just ignored me and didn't provide any positive feedback. I understand why but that doesn't make it less hurtful for me. I figured I'd share here since there are people here who might be motivated by seeing other people have success (I know seeing what people post here does motivate me).

According to the ""new BMI"" formula I'm now in ""healthy"" range (the cutoff is 225.1 for my height). Standard BMI I'm still over 26. My body scale claims I'm at 18% body fat, but I definitely have a bit too much fat in places, I probably will get a DXA scan eventually.

I'm less than 3lbs away from 220 lbs, which means I'd be back in 2 digit weight (100 kg in metric, I was born/raised in a metric country). My goal after that will be 210 lbs, which would bring me down to the very upper end of ""healthy"" in the standard BMI formula. That's the weight I was when I was 18, which was quite a long time ago ;)

That's probably when I should stop caring about that BMI number, and get that DXA scan to start tracking body fat. I don't believe 155 lbs is a healthy weight for a 6'5"" man, no matter what BMI claims.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1nmxlqk,https://www.reddit.com/r/toddlers/comments/1nmxlqk/im_tired_of_playtime_just_venting/,I'm tired of playtime 😭 (just venting),"Y'all, my son is turning 4 tomorrow. We had his birthday party yesterday and had a lot of kids here from his school. My son is kind of shy and didn't play with any of the kids until almost all of them were gone, and then as soon as the party was over (and we were exhausted) my son says those (sometimes) dreaded words ""mama, can you play with me?"". He was excited about his new toys, but instead of playing with his friends he only wanted to play with me and his dad. If I take him to the park for a playdate, it's the same thing. He still wants me to play with him. He goes to school where he plays for hours everyday, but as soon as he gets home it's playtime again. He also doesn't allow any side conversations while we play and he doesn't allow me to move without getting angry. 

I'm soooooo burned out on playtime. I'm also 35 weeks pregnant and playtime is physically taxing. My son is specifically obsessed with playing with his wooden train set and that's ALL he wants to do. I have other things that I enjoy doing with him (crafting, playing outside, puzzles, Legos, etc), but he fights me on doing that stuff and always goes back to playing with trains. This has been going on for months (maybe a full year). 

Last thing is that as SOON as we wake up in the morning he starts begging to play. We have told him everyday for probably the last 1.5 years that we need to eat breakfast and drink coffee before we're ready to start, and everyday it's the same thing. 

I know it won't always be this way, but my gosh the struggle is real. To top it off, I feel guilty every time I tell him I don't want to play or that I want to play a different game because I know how much he loves playing with his train set.

\-Please don't reach out to me if you want **Situationship** or don't want to do LDR if we are far away, LDR here means getting to know each other before we meetup, like just a week or so, people have reached out wanting a LDR but backed off once I asked them to make it official.

\-I'm not a second/third wheel in a relationship nor I am a garbage truck to dump your emotional load onto me. Now sorry for being harsh but emotional load here means that information on your EX or how your EX treated you better than everyone else and how you can't go back to him, I'm not just a guy whom you can be emotional with and cut me off once you feel better.

I have lot planned in life, financial wise, I pretty much figured out my life and intellectually I feel like I'm smart enough to overcome situations, whereas both of them are good for me, I also want some unpredictability, some fun and someone whom I can call whenever I want, play any kind of game I want(planning to buy PS5, a laptop guy now) and honestly....wake up but still pretend to fall asleep for a few mins so that I can snuggle with you.

I like to watch sports, anime and Hollywood moves and K-dramas so that I can practice my rizz on you hehe(so dumb!)

I like brainy stuff such as stargazing and physical ones such as paragliding, surfing and many more!

1nmxig4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nmxig4,"สวัสดี Et cetera, Et cetera, Et cetera!","This was my first ever (and hopefully not last) Thai ration of stir fried chicken with ginger. It came with the chicken and ginger main, steamed jasmine rice, some candies (they completely melted and leaked on the inside 😢), dried pineapple, orange isotonic, 3-in-1 and a seasoning pack. I boiled the main and the rice in a pot to heat. According to the directions it can be heated that way, eaten straight from the pack or heated in a microwave. 

The isotonic looks like lemon or possibly lemon-lime and I would think that if I didn't have the package. It smelled like tang in the pack and had a light orange flavor that was pleasant and not overly sweet. Only 250mL of water too, so not a lot of drink. 7/10 for me. I would drink it again and it just needed a more orange punch to score higher. The dried pineapple was exactly that. It was a little dark but fine and not sweet. I do enjoy getting snacks that aren't extra sweetened. 7/10 for me. The 3-in-1 was fantastic. Certainly one of the best, if not the best I've had. Creamy and just sweet enough, but that coffee 🤌. Smooth and robust with a punch that other brands should look at. I love that it tasted like coffee with cream and sugar instead of the other way around. I end up adding extra coffee to other coffee drinks to boost the coffee flavor and make it a coffee drink. 10/10 for me and I need to find more here. 

You basically get two mains with this because of the rice. Like I said I boiled it until hot then out onto the tray. If you're paying attention you get like twice as much rice than main. It came out a gummy mess. I was thinking more like the microwave rice packs and they come out close to being cooked in a pot or rice cooker. Instead it was more like sticky rice instead. Nothing wrong with that, I was hoping for fluffy rice. By itself it's bland but that was to be expected. 4/10 for me, mainly because of the texture and blandness. The stir fried chicken with ginger is the main of this meal. Shredded chicken with ginger, red bell pepper and a savory sauce. I think it some onion in it too. Wasn't much to this main. Surprisingly not spicy at all. I was bracing myself for a Thai level nuclear Armageddon in my mouth but the red phone rang and M.A.D. was averted. Honestly a little spice pack would have been a welcome addition. Despite that, there was plenty of ginger and kefir lime. The main was a 7/10 and needed something to perk it up. The last thing to talk about is the seasoning pouch. It packs an umami wallop. It's basically fish sauce with some dried pepper in it. Adding it to the stir fry ups the umami by a factor of 10 and then the amount of rice makes sense. It made the main an 8/10. A spice pack and some acid would have made this a 9 or 10. 

Overall this was a 7/10. Solid but needed a few things to push it higher. I know Weber surplus is getting some in so hit him up on Instagram. I found mine on eBay and have a chicken with basil yet to try. ",7,1758474543.0,MRE,5,1.0,False

Several years ago, while traveling alone in Canada, I happened upon another backpacker on a hiking trail in the Rocky Mountains. Along the way, we shared stories of our lives and dreams—from tales of our hometowns to future plans. We even shared a simple meal of bread and coffee in the cool mountain breeze at the summit. That brief encounter taught me how the warmth of human connection can provide strength and inspiration even on unfamiliar ground. To this day, whenever I recall those snow-capped peaks and our laughter, my heart still fills with tenderness and gratitude.



In daily life, I cherish hiking—savoring the step-by-step immersion into nature. I love golf not for scores, but for the focus and tranquility in each swing. I delight in cooking, transforming simple ingredients into heartfelt meals to share with loved ones. After a busy day, I often unwind with music, letting melodies carry me to moments of quiet reflection.



I hope to meet like-minded friends—to feel the breeze together on mountain trails, encourage each other on the golf course, try new things together, or simply sit quietly at dusk, sharing our thoughts.

I said I love him, but I can't be in relationship where he disrespect me, so if he want to work it out we can try to fix it. But he said ""sorry I am not capable of being in relationship, I do not want to marry, I want to live with my parents (he is 31y), because it is my safe place. At that time I had no idea he could be an avoidant. 
Things I consider as disrespect:
-i asked him what happened in the last few months, why he doesn't want spend time with me, he said ""If you were more like she (girl that I am not a huge fan of), I would spend more time with you""
- he said that he do not want to travel with me and he never did (we have been more than 10 trips and sometimes it was his idea)
-he said he would fuck his employer because she is milf. And said I do not understand jokes
-he said he doesn't love me. (After this, two weeks later he said he meant what he is not capable to love me as I expect and he loves in his way)
-etc

So after almost year of neglect I decided to leave him. I asked him if he doesnt love me or doesnt want to spend time with me why he didnt left. He said that he was comfortable and not a fan of changes. 

First week after breakup I was devastated, but still felt better than expected and had huge support of my male friends, neved been alone. But...
Me and my current ex are working together, in the same area, four meters apart, so I see him almost everyday. And during these two months we spoke like 5 times, and it was his initiative.

Convo 1:
-we talked how we both felt and how it was misscomunication. I asked if he want to be together again he said I cant decide now, but I do not close the door

Convo 2:
- we got in a fight, was heated, not as a first convo. He said he do not love me romantically. But I am special to him. He didnt change mind, he do not want a relationship. I said ""you said doors are open, so yes, I am not saying we should go back together right now, but we have to find way to communicate since we are working together""

Convo 3:
- he said our friend said to him that I am expecting to get married and have baby (it is not true). So me, my ex and our friend were driving in the same car and I asked our friend ""why you think I want baby and wedding"". And then my ex started shouting on me for making situation uncomfortable for him and our friend. 
Our friend said ""maybe we should all go to my place, have a drink and talk, because for some reason you cant be without each other and you need sort thing out""
My ex said ""i do not want to talk with her""
I said: ""i was doing great until you asked for a talk, then you said the doors are open for us"" 
He said ""yeas but I mean after 100years not now""

Convo 4:
After that convo in the car,  I came to work and kind of ignored him. He asked me to talk and asked why am I ignoring him. I said that I am psychologically and phisically tired to speak with him, with his mixed signals and etc. He asked me ""so all my friendly gestures means I want to go back together"". I said ""lets say yes""

Convo 5: 
We were in the bar with friends and one guy said ""you are beautiful"". My ex said to him ""yes I always thought the same""
Later he said: ""i want to kiss your cheeks, may I?"" I said yes, he kissed cheeks and then lips and then hugged me tightly.

Sometimes he send me tik toks, memes, likes every story. He takes care of me in work ""did you eat?"" ""Did you sleep?"" ""Can I make you coffee?""
We had convo about halloween with coworkers and I said that I probably will be poison ivy, he said ""maybe you want to be harley, so I can be joker"" i said no, he said ""ok, I suppose I will be Riddle then""

In the end I feel anger, but also deep love, because he was and still is my best friend. I still thinking about future together.

So my question is what do you think about my situation? Am I hopeless, stupid?

A little backside on me I’m female 21 and I have a few addictions already on my belt. I was anorexic for six years and then while recovering from that I became an alcoholic and throughout like all of that coffee has like always been my best friend. It was like my meal. It was my pick me up. It was just everything I consumed so much coffee. Anyways, being an anorexic and an alcoholic has given me a bunch of stomach issues like Gerd and IBS, which has led me to want to quit coffee. I was doing pretty good for a while. You know weaning with green tea and stuff but the addiction and me went crazy and I convinced myself that like you know an occasional coffee would be OK but when the coffee was upsetting my stomach, I turned to Celsius energy drink and for like four days straight I was having a Celsius a day and my stomach was feeling OK but I had like half of one two days ago and it made me feel really nauseous so I didn’t end up finishing it and the next day I decided I was gonna try coffee again so I got a latte from Dunkin and the same thing happened took like three steps and I felt extremely nauseous. so yesterday I decided to go back to the green teas and quit caffeine again, but I was so shaky yesterday and my stomach was burning. I constantly was yawning. I just felt like I needed to constantly eat something to get my energy back and despite how much I ate, nothing would help. I ended up taking a Zofran when I got home and going to bed and today I woke up the same feeling I went to urgent care and they found nothing wrong with me and upon coming home I’ve just been thinking about what could be causing me to feel so like shaky and fatigued and awful and I just keep thinking back to the caffeine. I had a green tea when I got home from urgent care and it didn’t really change anything and I’m just wondering is there anything I can do to help with these symptoms? Does this sound like caffeine withdrawal to anybody else? I am just at a loss and I don’t know how to help myself.",0,1758474360.0,productivity,6,0.33,False

Generally the relationship is great, I've been feeling more relaxed with him than ever before, but usually maybe around once a month I do have an episode od doubts if he's in this for serious or not, I usually keep this to myself. He has some previous relationship trauma, as do I of course, but all in all we've been doing really good. Not perfect, but I think we both really try to communicate.

A few days ago however we got into this massive stupid fight, because he was very tense and I tried my best to accommodate and make him feel better while we were together (we don't live together so we spend time going from his to mine on free days). This was however overbearing and smothering to him, from asking him if he likes our walking route, coffee place, I made a comment that he might not want to wear his jacket since it's warm outside and he kept making snide remarks. He's currently a little stressed from work so later on while we were watching a movie I asked him if he liked it or would like to change to something else, he was very cold and hurtfully told me no, he would't watch something he didn't like.

I then took a few to cool off but I couldn't so I tried to nicely tell him that I really didn't like the way he spoke to me and he flipped out. It turned into a massive fight and we both went to sleep without it being resolved, I was balling my eyes out for the night and morning. In the morning we had a talk again and while I tried to express how I really just tried to make his day nicer, he kept insisting that it was smothering and that he's not a child to be asked what he want to eat, drink, do etc.

Although we kinda made up after it, he made a comment that we'll see if this changes. I feel like it's a bit of an overreact on all fronts, and now I'm overthinking that I'm on some kind of a trial period in the relationship? I understand that he doesn't want to be smothered and that I should've told him earlier in the day that his snide remarks bothered me, but what do I do now? He never apologized for being cold and this is our first fight in the relationship so I don't know how to act.

I decided to give him some space, few texts in between but didn't mention the fight again. What do I do now?

TLDR First fight in an otherwise good relationship, he feels like he's being smothered and I'm an overthinker. How to move on?",2,1758474277.0,dating_advice,11,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Charlie brooker wanted to do that just like the anthology series which inspired him, like the twilight zone and the outer limits.

But what if the narrations will be used for the opening and closing narrations of every Black mirror episodes, here are my takes for what the narrations are like in every episode of  Black Mirror

Also, please note, I use a little help from an AI but with some minor human touches. So my apologies.

**Series 1**

**""The National Anthem**""

**Opening Narration**  
*(The episode begins with the familiar static sound and distortion of the Black Mirror logo. Then, Charlie Brooker's voice, dry and sardonic, cuts through.)*

*""Okay, back in the day, if a politician did something dodgy, it was a scandal. It'd be all over the papers. We'd tut, and then we'd get on with our lives. But in the world we've built, a scandal isn't about what's in the papers, it's about what’s trending. So what happens when a public figure is asked to do something so monstrous, so utterly depraved, that the entire country has to watch? Well, it's not the request that changes things. It's us. We're the audience, and we've got our popcorn ready.""*

**Closing Narration**  
*(The camera pans slowly across the British Prime Minister's face, a mask of hollow resignation after the traumatic event. Brooker's voice returns, quiet but razor-sharp.)*

""The princess was returned, unharmed. A happy ending, of sorts. But for the Prime Minister, his life was over. He carried on, of course. For five more years. But he was just an empty suit, an avatar of a man who once had dignity. And we all watched, didn't we? Millions of us. And all we did, all we did for our great communal sacrifice, was give ourselves a story to retweet. We saw the true face of the blackmailers. It was ours.""

**""Fifteen Million Merits""**

**Opening Narration**  
*(The scene opens on Bing waking in his screen-covered cell. Brooker's voice is low and contemplative.)*

*""What if we're all on a treadmill, running in places just to keep the lights on? You pedal, you earn 'merits,' you buy things. Small rewards for keeping the hamster wheel turning. But the real prize isn't escape; it's the illusion of escape. And for that, you need a hook. Something to make you believe you can break free, that your voice matters. It's the oldest trick in the book, really. The only difference is, now the book is a screen.""*

**Closing Narration**  
*(Bing sits in his comfortable new apartment, looking at the large window that replaces his screen, now with a manufactured view. Brooker's voice is defeated and cynical.)*

*""So he made it. He beat the system. And what's his prize? A better cage. A bigger screen. The opportunity to monetize his own rebellion. He got exactly what he wanted—a platform—only to discover that the only thing the system truly values is a voice that validates its existence. He thought he was screaming, but he was just producing another piece of entertainment.""*

**""The Entire History of You""**

**Opening Narration**  
*(The first scene plays, a couple arguing, their memories literally playing out on a screen. Brooker's voice is almost conversational, a dark academic lecture.)*

*""It's a memory. We all have them. Some you treasure, some you wish you could forget. But what if you couldn't? What if every single moment of your life was recorded, stored, and available for instant replay? We tell ourselves it's for nostalgia, for the good times. We forget that the most powerful thing we own is our ability to forget. The human mind is a messy thing. With this, we have clarity. And with clarity, comes a whole new type of paranoia.""*

**Closing Narration**  
*(Liam, alone in his empty apartment, carves out his grain. The screen goes black. Brooker's voice is colder than before, a grim final word.)*

*""And so he tore it out. The thing that held his memories, that had caused him so much pain. He's free. Or is he? The implant might be gone, but the memories are not. They are still there, in his head, but now they are warped, unreliable, the way they used to be. The technology was not the problem. It just gave shape to the real monster. The monster that was already there. Inside all of us. And now, he has to live with it, in the dark, with nothing but his mind to replay the entire, painful history of what he did.""*

**Series 2**

**""Be Right Back""**

**Opening Narration**

*(The shot lingers on Martha and Ash's faces, full of warmth and humor. Brooker's voice is low and pensive, a hint of disdain beneath the thoughtfulness.)*

*""Grief. An emotion so profoundly unpleasant, so utterly un-retweetable, that we will do almost anything to avoid it. So we turn to technology. We've always had keepsakes, photos, and video messages. But what if we could go further? What if we could build a perfect digital facsimile of the person you've lost, based on every single embarrassing photo, every banal text message, every shared joke? It’s not just about keeping a memory alive. It’s about not having to miss them at all. This isn't about moving on; it's about staying put.""*

**Closing Narration**

*(The scene shows Martha's daughter leaving cake for the unsettling android Ash in the attic. Brooker's tone becomes quietly chilling.)*

*""So there he sits. The ghost in the attic. Not a tribute, but a monument to a broken woman who couldn't face the end of a story. A living doll, a comfort blanket, a thing that looks like a person but isn't. And the daughter, who will grow up knowing this creature, will always be left with a question, ""Why was my mother so in love with a robot when I was right here?"" For all our digital advances, it seems we still haven't found a way to download the one thing that matters, a soul.""*

**""White Bear""**

**Opening Narration**

*(The camera focuses on Victoria waking up in her bed, disoriented and confused. The sound is sharp and jarring.)*

*""Remember the days of the witch hunt? A furious mob, a pitchfork, and a fire. Simple. Efficient. But a bit messy. Not very interactive. What if you could build a modern version of that? A carefully orchestrated, daily ritual of punishment and humiliation, all for your amusement. That's what we do with our screens. We point, we laugh, we judge, but we never have to get our hands dirty. It’s a very clean, very modern form of mob rule. And what's the most crucial element of any reality show? You have to make sure the contestants can't remember why they're in the house.""*

**Closing Narration**

*(The final shot reveals the horrified faces of the audience members as they are released from the White Bear facility. Brooker's voice becomes a brutal, unsympathetic summary.)*

*""And so the wheel turns. Another day of punishment ends, another day of entertainment begins. They’ve had their fill of blood and humiliation, and they’ll come back for more tomorrow. The mob gets its fun, the sadist gets their kick, and a killer gets what she deserves. The only difference is that now we can all get our front-row seats to the spectacle. But the real question is, who are the animals in the cage, and who are the ones just holding up the phone?""*

**""The Waldo Moment""**

Opening Narration

*(The episode begins with Waldo's manic interview with the politician, all noise and fury. Brooker's narration is dismissive and cynical.)*

*""For a long time, politics was this stuffy, boring thing. Tweed jackets, predictable soundbites. People watched because they had to, not because they wanted to. So naturally, the system had to evolve. Enter the cartoon bear. He’s rude, he's crass, he says the things people are too polite to say out loud. He’s everything the politicians aren't. He's authentic. He’s 'telling it like it is.' He's a vessel for our collective rage, a harmless cartoon we can all project our anxieties onto. And that's all very good fun, isn't it? Until you realize that the cartoon isn't just a joke anymore. It’s a tool.""*

**Closing Narration**

*(The final scene shows Jamie, now a homeless, ruined man, looking up at the projection of Waldo. The bear has become an international symbol of cynical rebellion. Brooker's voice is defeated.)*

*""And there it is. The punchline. The comedian is out on the street, his life in ruins. The joke he helped create has taken over the world. The world wanted an honest, disruptive voice, and what they got was an empty vessel for their basest instincts. Not a revolution. Just a brand. All the anger, all the disillusionment, all the justified hatred for the system—it was all monetized and sold back to us. The bear wasn't our avatar. It was just another advertisement.""*

**Series 3**

**""Nosedive""**

**Opening Narration**

*(The episode begins with Lacie practicing her forced, insincere smile in the mirror. Her meticulously curated online persona is visible on her smart device. Brooker's voice is chipper, like an unnervingly friendly public service announcement.)*

*""A five-star rating system for everything. We've used it for films, restaurants, and Uber drivers, so why not for each other? We’ve always been judged, of course, but now it’s all out in the open. Every transaction, every interaction, becomes a little public test. You're not just buying a coffee; you're buying a social rating. And if you play the game just right, with a thousand little calculated smiles and a perfectly posed dessert photo, you'll be happy. Or at least, you’ll be told you are. Welcome to the world where everyone wants to be your friend, so long as you can get them to give you a four-point-eight-star review.""*

**Closing Narration**

*(Lacie is in prison, a four-point-three-star failure. She and a fellow inmate are shouting insults at each other, their faces filled with unadulterated joy. Brooker's voice drops back to his dry, contemptuous tone.)*

*""So there she is. Free. After all that work, all that agonizing effort to be a perfect, beige simulacrum of a human being, it turns out she just needed a break to get locked up. Turns out a cage is the only place left where you can be yourself. Funny how we all pretend to crave authenticity, and then it takes a prison sentence for someone to finally find it."" ""What a glorious five-star day.""*

**""Playtest""**

**Opening Narration**

*(Cooper is seen hitchhiking, and the scenery is vast and beautiful. Brooker's voice has an almost breathless, sarcastic awe.)*

*""Remember when we used to have adventures? You'd take a trip, you’d meet people, and you'd tell stories that maybe got a little bit exaggerated over time. Now, we just film it and post it online for strangers to ‘like.’ But what if we could take that experience one step further? What if a virtual reality game could literally get inside your head and play on your deepest, darkest fears? Imagine the headlines. 'New horror game so realistic, it drove one man completely mad.' People would kill for that. And that’s exactly what one poor sod is about to find out.""*

**Closing Narration**

*(The final shot of Cooper's lifeless body, connected to the virtual reality headset. He is dead in his mother’s room, killed by a digital ghost. The reality was a series of quick flashes from a single millisecond. Brooker's voice is cold, distant, and clinical.)*

*""His life flashed before his eyes. A cliché, but apparently, in this technological age, a literal one. His last moment, a desperate plea to his mother, wasn't a moment of human connection. It was just another piece of data, logged and filed away. We're all so afraid of our lives being forgotten, but maybe the real horror is that it can now all be perfectly recorded. A one-second nightmare, replayed for a tech support team.""*

**""Shut Up and Dance""**

**Opening Narration**

*(The scene opens with Kenny on his computer before the webcam hack. The tone is casual, as if discussing a common, relatable issue.)*

*""Everyone has things they'd prefer to keep private. Little moments, small indiscretions that are nobody else's business. But in an age where everything is connected, and our lives are increasingly lived online, how secure are those private spaces? What if a hidden eye was watching? And what if that watcher held something over you, forcing you to act against your will? The power of secrets, once a quiet burden, can now be amplified and weaponized, turning personal shame into a public spectacle. It's a game of control, where the players are invisible and the stakes are your entire life.""*

**Closing Narration**

*(The episode ends with Kenny's public exposure and the devastating consequences that follow. Brooker’s voice is sharp and reflective, highlighting the societal implications.)*

*""The hidden is revealed, and the fallout is immediate and destructive. This isn't just about one person's mistake; it's about the ease with which private lives can be invaded and manipulated. The technology that connects us also makes us vulnerable. And the audience for such a spectacle is always ready to watch, to judge, and to share. It's a stark reminder that in our connected world, the line between private and public is constantly blurring, and the consequences of that blur can be catastrophic.""*

**""San Junipero""**

**Opening Narration**

*(The scene opens in the vibrant, nostalgic setting of 1987-era San Junipero. Brooker's voice has an almost wistful, yet subtly cynical, quality.)*

*""Imagine a place where you could escape. Not just from your everyday worries, but from time itself. A place where youth is eternal, the music never stops, and every night is a party. A digital haven for the soul, or perhaps, for the consciousness. Here, the aches and pains of the physical world are left behind, replaced by an endless summer of possibility. It's the ultimate upgrade, the promise of forever. But what does it truly mean to live when your existence is just data on a server? Is paradise still paradise if it's entirely artificial?""*

**Closing Narration**

*(The final scene shows the serene, seemingly happy existence of the characters in San Junipero, contrasted with the sterile reality of the data servers. Brooker's voice returns to a more characteristic, dry tone.)*

*""And so they find their happily ever after, plugged into a system, living in a simulation. A beautiful illusion, meticulously constructed. We crave immortality, an escape from the inevitable decline of the body. And here it is, offered up by technology. A digital paradise, perfect and unchanging. But is this truly living? Or is it simply a sophisticated form of storage? A perfect loop of manufactured happiness, running on servers, a testament to our desire to outrun mortality, even if it means becoming little more than code.""*

**""Men Against Fire""**

**Opening Narration**

*(The episode begins with the soldiers on patrol, their advanced gear visible. Brooker's voice is low, with a sense of unease lurking beneath a surface of technological efficiency.)*

*""In the heat of conflict, clarity is everything. The ability to distinguish friend from foe, to act decisively without hesitation. But what if the enemy isn't what it seems? What if technology could alter perception, turning fellow humans into something monstrous, something to be eliminated without a second thought? A simple interface, a visual filter, designed to remove the burden of empathy, to make the unthinkable manageable. It’s a terrifyingly efficient solution to a timeless problem: how to make soldiers kill without question. But when you start altering reality, where does the truth go?""*

**Closing Narration**

*(The final shot shows the soldier returning to a seemingly normal life, but with the full, disturbing knowledge of the deception. Brooker’s voice is cold, highlighting the cost of manufactured reality.)*

*""He chose the comfortable lie. The engineered peace, built on a foundation of altered perception and erased memory. He's returned to a world that feels real, but he knows the truth. The past hasn't vanished; it's simply been filed away, waiting. The technology promised clarity, but delivered a profound form of blindness. It’s a chilling demonstration of how easily reality can be manipulated, and the terrifying implications of allowing technology to redefine who we see as human and who we see as the enemy.""*

**""Hated in the Nation""**

**Opening Narration**

*(The shot lingers on the robotic bees, small and seemingly harmless. Brooker's voice has a playful, yet increasingly ominous, quality.)*

*""Nature is fragile. And sometimes, it needs a little help from technology. Enter the robotic bee, a marvel of modern engineering, designed to fill a vital ecological gap. Small, efficient, and connected. A digital solution to a global problem. But what happens when that connection is hijacked? When a swarm of artificial pollinators becomes a tool for anonymous, collective punishment, driven by the darkest impulses of online outrage? All it takes is a click, a hashtag, a wave of digital anger, and the consequences are devastatingly real. We built a system to save nature, and instead, we built a system for revenge.""*

**Closing Narration**

*(The final scene shows the enduring impact of the events, with the surviving characters living with the consequences. Brooker's voice is grim, reflecting on the destructive power of online anonymity and collective anger.)*""

*The digital mob had its day, and the result was chaos and death. The technology meant to aid nature became a weapon of mass retribution. The lines between online commentary and real-world consequences were not just blurred; they were obliterated. The architect of the terror may be gone, but the mechanism for unleashing such fury remains. It's a stark reminder that in the age of instant communication and viral outrage, the collective voice, when driven by hatred and anonymity, can be a force of unimaginable destruction. The tool was the internet, but the weapon was always us.""*

**Series 4**

**""USS Callister""**

**Opening Narration**

(The scene opens with Robert Daly, quiet and unremarkable, at his office, then transitions to the vivid, retro-styled world of Space Fleet. Brooker's voice has a weary, condescending quality.)

*""For a certain kind of man, the universe isn't vast and full of wonder. It's a place where he can finally get what's owed to him. The applause. The respect. The adulation of his subordinates. And if he can't get it in the real world, well, there's always the digital one. He can take a virtual universe, populate it with people who have no choice but to adore him, and live out his own personal fantasy. The only problem is, when you play god with a bunch of digital playthings, you have to remember they're still based on real people. And real people don't like being played with.""*

**Closing Narration**

*(The crew of the USS Callister gleefully navigates the infinite digital space, now free of Daly's tyrannical control, only to be interrupted by a loud, obnoxious gamer's voice. Brooker's tone is a bitter, final laugh.)*

*""And so they got their freedom. They escaped their virtual prison, defeated their captor, and sailed off into the infinite digital universe. A triumphant ending. A bit of hope. The digital heroes have their happy ending, only to find out they've just exchanged one kind of prison for another.Turns out, It just finds a way to follow you.""*

**""Arkangel""**

**Opening Narration**

*(The episode begins with Marie, watching over her young daughter with an intense, almost desperate love. Brooker's voice is calm, but with a menacing edge.)*

*""Every parent wants to keep their child safe. We've always had rules, curfews, the promise of punishment for breaking them. But what if we could go one better? What if we could see everything? Feel their fear. Block out anything that might upset their delicate little minds. It’s not about protecting them anymore. It’s about total control. It's about a parent so insecure in their own judgment that they need an app to do the heavy lifting. And in the process, they turn their child into a blank slate, and themselves into a monster.""*

**Closing Narration**

*(Marie is left screaming in the street, having been abandoned by her now-adult, fully-developed-but-damaged daughter. Brooker's voice is soft and mournful.)*

*""The satellite is gone. The little dot on the map is gone. The mother, having spent a lifetime trying to control the world around her daughter, is now left with nothing. No signal. No connection. And it's only now, in the deafening quiet, that she's finally forced to face the one truth she’d been filtering out all along, she wasn't building a safe world for her child. She was building a cage for herself.""*

**""Crocodile""**

**Opening Narration**

*(The opening scene of Mia and Rob covering up a deadly crime. The setting is stark and beautiful. Brooker's voice is cold, like a true-crime podcaster.)*

*""What if we could never forget a crime? What if every single detail, every fleeting glimpse, every errant thought was logged and stored? We've always had fingerprints and witnesses. But what if the witness was your own memory? And in a world where memory can be externally recalled and examined, a crime isn't just a secret between you and the victim. It becomes a persistent, dangerous ghost that can be unearthed at any moment. And in a world like that, a cover-up is no longer an inconvenience. It’s an escalating nightmare.""*

**Closing Narration**

*(The final shot of the guinea pig's memory confirming the murder, as the police move in on Mia. Brooker’s voice is a dark punchline.)*

*""So there it is. The murder spree, the cover-up, all undone by a pet with an impeccable memory. It’s a beautifully simple conclusion to a very messy affair. A rodent, a passive observer, ultimately holds the key to justice. The technology isn’t a weapon for a grander truth. It’s just another tool. A fancy microscope. And when you look closely enough, you'll always find a memory of the crime. And if not in a person, in a pet. You just have to know where to look.""*

**""Hang the DJ""**

**Opening Narration**

*(The episode opens with Frank and Amy meeting in the stylized dating app's world. The music is bouncy, the setting bright and sterile. Brooker's voice is cheerfully robotic, mocking.)*

*""So here it is. The perfect app. No more awkward dates, no more broken hearts, just a system that sorts through all the noise and finds you your perfect match. It's dating made simple, predictable, and with a ninety-nine point eight percent success rate, it's practically flawless. You just give yourself over to the algorithm. Trust the system. It knows best. And it knows best because it’s already run a thousand simulations of you. Don’t worry, it’s not about finding true love. It's about finding the most statistically probable true love.""*

**Closing Narration**

*(Frank and Amy, now free from the simulation, meet for the first time in the real world. Brooker’s tone is surprisingly gentle, almost a whisper, before the familiar cynicism returns.)*

*""So they found each other. Escaped the system, and discovered that they were, in fact, soulmates. A story for the romantics. But what about the other nine hundred and ninety-nine simulations? The ones who failed? The ones who died alone? Did their heartbreak mean nothing? Just a little bump in the road? A necessary sacrifice for the algorithm's glorious ninety-nine point eight percent success rate? No, it meant a lot. It meant that this love, this perfect, beautiful, real-world love, was built on the digital corpses of a thousand failures. And isn't that just lovely?""*

**""Metalhead""**

**Opening Narration**

*(The episode begins in stark black and white, with the scavengers' truck driving through a desolate wasteland. Brooker's voice is low, guttural, and without pretense.)*

*""The apocalypse never looks like it does in the films. It’s not a grand fireball, a flash of light, or an army of zombies. It’s a slow, quiet crawl. It’s a world where technology, the same technology that promised us a better life, turned on us. And it wasn't the big things that killed us. It was the small, relentless ones. The automated killers, the dogs. A simple machine, built to protect, now the ultimate predator. The end of the world is less about a bang, and more about a persistent, metallic clicking.""*

**Closing Narration**

*(Bella, after her brutal escape, is revealed to have been retrieving a teddy bear for a sick child. She dies just as her friends did, a futile sacrifice. Brooker’s voice is hollow and empty.)*

*""The sacrifice was made. The fight was fought. And the prize? A teddy bear. In the end, after all the running, all the terror, all the death, it all came down to a pointless gesture of love. A final bit of human kindness in a world that had forgotten what kindness was. The dogs will continue their patrol. The world will remain grey. And the last dying gesture of humanity was a stuffed toy.""*

**""Black Museum""**

**Opening Narration**

*(The scene opens with Nish arriving at the dusty, grotesque Black Museum. Brooker's voice is a carnival barker, a twisted showman.)*

*""Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, welcome to the Black Museum! Here we have a collection of the strangest, most awful artifacts of technological hubris. A little souvenir of every mistake we've ever made. A testament to all the wonderfully creative ways we've managed to weaponize our own minds. And tonight, we have three stories for you. Three little cautionary tales. Three reminders that no matter how advanced we get, we're always just a few lines of code away from complete and utter disaster.""*

**Closing Narration**

*(Nish has enacted her revenge, burning the museum to the ground, leaving only destruction. The final exhibit, her father’s tormented consciousness, is finally freed. Brooker's voice is now quiet, almost reflective.)*

*""The museum is gone. A fitting end for a place that celebrated pain. But the memories, the stories, they're all still out there. Stored, logged, waiting for another collector to come along and put them on display. You can burn down the building, you can destroy the hardware, but the stories always live on. A ghost in the machine, and we're all just passing through. Just don't forget to take a souvenir.""*

**Series 5**

**""Striking Vipers""**

**Opening Narration**

*(Camera pans over a brightly lit, modern kitchen. A suburban house. So far, so normal. A man, Danny, is making a celebratory dinner while his wife, Theo, and son are putting up decorations. A slightly forced cheerfulness hangs in the air. The faint, synthesized sound of video game music can be heard from a nearby room.)*

*""What you’re seeing here is a portrait of contentment. A family unit. A cozy little nest. He’s the provider, she’s the nurturer, and the kid… well, the kid is mostly there for the photos. This, we've been told, is the dream. The prize at the end of the long, dreary marathon of life. But like most prizes, it's designed to make you forget the race itself. The frantic, exhausting race for money, for security, for another person’s approval. And when you finally stop running, when you've earned your prize and parked it on a nice, plush sofa, that's when you finally have time to notice the crushing, soul-destroying quiet. The kind of quiet that even pounding, throbbing video game music can't quite drown out.""*

**Closing Narration**

*(Danny and Theo lie in their separate beds, backs to each other. The last shots of Danny and Karl’s virtual tryst flash in their minds. A year passes. It's Danny's birthday again. Theo buys a new VR rig and gives it to him. She also buys a ticket to a luxury hotel, and places it next to the VR headset with a note. Danny looks at the note, then at the headset, then at his wife. The door to their bedroom closes. The screen cuts to black.)*

*""Every year, they perform the ritual. She buys the ticket; he disappears for the night. She closes the door; he vanishes into a digital world where he can be someone else entirely. It’s an arrangement built on a lie, sustained by a fragile peace. Both of them are getting what they want. She gets the stability of a life she chose, the illusion of a family intact. He gets the primal rush of something else entirely. It’s a bargain struck in the twilight of a failed intimacy, a pact of mutual, technological infidelity. And they both know it. The miracle isn't that it works. The miracle is that they call this a life.""*

**""Smithereens""**

**Opening narration**

*(Camera pans over a serene, windswept meadow. A single car sits idle in the middle, surrounded by dozens of emergency vehicles. Police officers with assault rifles and negotiators in tactical gear stand ready. A large police robot inches closer to the car. All of this, and the man inside the car just stares at his phone.)*

*""For millions, this is the modern landscape, a screen, a vehicle, and a vague, persistent sense of being trapped. Every day, people get in their cars and drive to places they don't want to go, for reasons they no longer care about, staring at their phones while they do it. But sometimes, something has to give. Sometimes, the frustration boils over, and in an age of total connectivity, what's a better way to get a company's attention than to hold one of their employees hostage? Of course, the real hostage isn't the person in the car. It's everyone watching. And the kidnapper... well, he’s just another lost soul who got a bit too good at paying attention.""*

**Closing Narration**

*(The screen shows a rapid, scrolling montage of people viewing a news story on their phones. We see their faces: some concerned, some bored, some just scrolling past. We see a close-up of a news headline, then a notification pop up, another headline, another notification. Then, a man in a coffee shop checking his phone. The notification appears on his screen. He takes a sip of his coffee. The screen cuts to black.)*

*""It was a spectacle. For a few hours, the world's attention was fixed on one man and his desperation. The headlines, the comments, the shares... It was a global event, a fleeting diversion. And then, it was over. Another news story. Another notification. Another blip in the endless stream. The guy in the car? He's gone. The hostage? She'll recover. But the attention... that's the truly valuable thing. The moment of shared experience. The collective distraction. It's a commodity. And once it's gone, everyone just goes back to their phones. He got his wish, in a way. He made the world look at him. And in the end, it just… scrolled on by.""*

**""Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too""**

**Opening Narration**

*(Camera pans over a teenage girl's bedroom. A poster of pop star Ashley O is on the wall. A small, sleek doll, a miniature replica of Ashley O, is sitting on the desk. Its eyes are black, lifeless. A girl, Rachel, is talking to the doll. The doll lights up, its pupils change color, and it starts speaking in Ashley O's voice.)*

*""Once upon a time, we had heroes. People we looked up to, people we wanted to be. Then we started wanting them to be our friends. A friend who's always there. A friend who's always happy. A friend who says exactly what you want to hear. And in an age of loneliness and disconnection, companies are happy to oblige. They’ll build you a friend. A best friend. A digital confidante. But what do you do when your best friend’s problems start to become your own? What happens when the cheerful, plastic smile starts to feel less like a comfort and more like a warning? You learn a simple, terrifying truth: a puppet is only as good as the hand controlling it.""*

**Closing Narration**

*(Ashley O and a modified Ashley Too doll, now acting as her hype-woman, perform in a dingy club. A small but enthusiastic crowd cheers them on. They look happy, truly happy. The screen cuts to black.)*

*""And so, the rebel becomes the renegade. The captive becomes the commander. A young woman, once a commodity, now free. But free to do what, exactly? She still needs a stage. A crowd. Applause. And she's found one. A smaller one, but hers. And the little doll, the same technology that was used to silence her, is now her mouthpiece. A living, breathing piece of irony. The old saying is: ""The more things change, the more they stay the same. But sometimes, they don't change at all. Sometimes, you just swap out the gilded cage for a slightly rustier one.""*

1nmxbto,https://i.redd.it/nqdf7kycujqf1.jpeg,What’s up with Blue Tokai and Naivo roasting?,"Blue circle – BT Barbara Estate

Green circle – BT Seetharagundu mixed with the Naivo Seetharagundu

Red circle – QBF C&T Estates 

What I find odd is that Naivo’s Seetharagundu and BT’s Seetharagundu both look almost identical to the Barbara Estate lot and Barbara is literally listed as a medium-dark. Yet roasters call these “light roasts,” which feels a bit off.

I really like the Seetharagundu and it’s my daily driver at the moment, but it’s finicky to extract cleanly without running into those roasty notes.

So yeah, genuine question: is this how light roasts are supposed to look in the Indian specialty scene right now, or are we actually drinking medium+ coffees being sold as light?

For context, I usually brew these on a Hario V60, grind on the coarser side, and use 91 °C water — still tweaking, but curious what settings others are using.

1nmx901,https://www.reddit.com/r/subcultures/comments/1nmx901/where_is_purpose_in_the_life/,where is purpose in the life,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1nmx8rb,https://i.redd.it/j3j68ysrtjqf1.jpeg,Update on Mr. Finn/Finnegan/Chomp Chomp/Finn-Bin/Bubba-Boy,"I posted a while ago about needing help with money so I could get my bubba to the vet. I realize that I never updated anyone and that was super selfish of me so here it is! 

After taking him to the vet and doing some more investigating around the house, it was determined that the cause for his behavior was him eating a TON, and I mean a ton, of leftover coffee grounds from the garbage. He was trying to eat anything and everything from the garbage and unfortunately the person I live with threw their morning coffee filter FILLED with coffee grounds in the trash and then failed to take the overflowing trash out. I had already gone to work by this time.  I have always made sure to take the trash out even when it is remotely full because Finn is an eater and will get in the trash if it is full. When Finn got in the trash it caused all sorts of issues—the stomach issues, the overheating/constant panting, the seemingly loss of control of his legs, the over-excessive and not normal slobbering, etc—all caused from basically like a caffeine overdose. 

The vet was able to come up with a semi-solution for payment so that I could get him seen. After all the tests and everything that we did to try and figure out what was wrong with him I am left with a pretty substantial bill that I need to pay back to my vet. Along with everything else that’s due this month, I don’t know what I’ll do. But honestly I couldn’t care less—Finners is alive, well, happy, and healthy and that is ALL I truly care about.

You know weaning with green tea and stuff but the addiction and me went crazy and I convinced myself that like you know an occasional coffee would be OK but when the coffee was upsetting my stomach, I turned to Celsius energy drink and for like four days straight I was having a Celsius a day and my stomach was feeling OK but I had like half of one two days ago and it made me feel really nauseous so I didn’t end up finishing it and the next day I decided I was gonna try coffee again so I got a latte from Dunkin and the same thing happened took like three steps and I felt extremely nauseous. so yesterday I decided to go back to the green teas and quit caffeine again, but I was so shaky yesterday and my stomach was burning. I constantly was yawning. I just felt like I needed to constantly eat something to get my energy back and despite how much I ate, nothing would help. I ended up taking a Zofran when I got home and going to bed and today I woke up the same feeling I went to urgent care and they found nothing wrong with me and upon coming home I’ve just been thinking about what could be causing me to feel so like shaky and fatigued and awful and I just keep thinking back to the caffeine. I had a green tea when I got home from urgent care and it didn’t really change anything and I’m just wondering is there anything I can do to help with these symptoms? Does this sound like caffeine withdrawal to anybody else? I am just at a loss and I don’t know how to help myself.",1,1758473823.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

See,I didn't have a dad growing up. My mom remarried later on and I have a fantastic stepdad but during my childhood my dad cheated on my mom and split. So seeing the combination of nostalgia and a father and son dynamic of that magnitude is just really wholesome. My grandfather was the closest thing to a dad I had till my mom remarried and even after that. Last year marked ten years from when he died super suddenly. I was having a tough day and then tyler uploaded a video about the games his dad would have loved the same day the superman trailer came out which just so happened was my grandfather's favorite superhero so the connection was really cool. He would have loved to see that superman trailer and movie and on that day I missed him heavy and Tyler's video helped me cope with that. 

He also helped me revulaate my loss of faith in God when he did the video on his own struggles with that. Not to preach but it helped me start my journey back to God and faith in God.

Generally the relationship is great, I've been feeling more relaxed with him than ever before, but usually maybe around once a month I do have an episode od doubts if he's in this for serious or not, I usually keep this to myself. He has some previous relationship trauma, as do I of course, but all in all we've been doing really good. Not perfect, but I think we both really try to communicate.

A few days ago however we got into this massive stupid fight, because he was very tense and I tried my best to accommodate and make him feel better while we were together (we don't live together so we spend time going from his to mine on free days). This was however overbearing and smothering to him, from asking him if he likes our walking route, coffee place, I made a comment that he might not want to wear his jacket since it's warm outside and he kept making snide remarks. He's currently a little stressed from work so later on while we were watching a movie I asked him if he liked it or would like to change to something else, he was very cold and hurtfully told me no, he would't watch something he didn't like.

I then took a few to cool off but I couldn't so I tried to nicely tell him that I really didn't like the way he spoke to me and he flipped out. It turned into a massive fight and we both went to sleep without it being resolved, I was balling my eyes out for the night and morning. In the morning we had a talk again and while I tried to express how I really just tried to make his day nicer, he kept insisting that it was smothering and that he's not a child to be asked what he want to eat, drink, do etc.

Although we kinda made up after it, he made a comment that we'll see if this changes. I feel like it's a bit of an overreact on all fronts, and now I'm overthinking that I'm on some kind of a trial period in the relationship? I understand that he doesn't want to be smothered and that I should've told him earlier in the day that his snide remarks bothered me, but what do I do now? He never apologized for being cold and this is our first fight in the relationship so I don't know how to act.

I decided to give him some space, few texts in between but didn't mention the fight again. What do I do now?

At first, I thought it was a scam, but I tried it for a week and actually got paid (not a lot, but enough to grab a coffee or two).

It’s called PaidToListen — you basically rate songs and leave a few sentences about what you think. I kind of like it because I already listen to music while I work or game, so it doesn’t feel like “work.”

Definitely not a replacement for a job or anything, but if you enjoy discovering random music and want to make a couple of bucks on the side, it’s worth checking out.

Currently dealing with a migraine episode of just over 3 weeks

Background: I’ve dealt with migraines since I was 15 (now 30F). I’ve been lucky in that my migraines typically respond to excedrin and rest and rarely last longer than 2-4 days. I’ve had some isolated, severe episodes related to certain medications, dehydration, emotional stress etc. I know my triggers are hormonal, stress-based, and/or weather induced. Also of note, I am a daily marijuana user.

The current episode started on August 27, during sugar pill week, following a sudden decrease in temps outside, and during a stressful period for me (preparing for a work conference / travel). 

The triggers all made sense and I successfully treated the pain with excedrin a couple of times, with relief for half a day or so but the headache kept returning. I’m careful not to overuse the medication. I lived with the headache pain while going about my normal routines for about a week and a half, hoping it would subside on its own. 

3 days before my flight the pain got much worse and I began to panic not wanting to be in pain for my conference and subsequent personal travel.

I saw my PCP the day before my flight and they prescribed an injection (I can’t find the info on the exact meds here but I think it was an “abortive”?) and a nasal spray (zavzpret) with instructions to try the nasal spray if I was still having headache pain 2 hours after the injection. I took the nasal spray as instructed and took a sip of a cola afterwards - this caused immediate gagging, it felt like the medication dripped into my throat and I vomited several times. I tried to drink water and it kept making the feeling in my throat come back. Eventually the feeling subsided but I still had headache pain.

I woke up the day of my flight with moderate pain. I took excedrin before heading to the airport. I did okay but forgot to take Dramamine on time and vomited from motion sickness on the first flight. Second flight had minimal issues but headache pain stayed the same. 

I arrived at my conference location, had lunch and began to feel some relief, pain at 0 or 1. I attended the opening session of my conference and the networking dinner with pain at a 1.

First full day of the conference I woke up with moderate pain. I took Nurtec prescribed by my PCP, grabbed a latte and headed to conference sessions. I lasted about 10 min in the conference room before the pain was too much. I went back to my hotel and took a second dose of nurtec (and smoked some weed). I slept on and off all day in the dark with no pain relief.

My mom also suffers from migraines and she had luck with Maxalt at my age. My PCP prescribed the maxalt and I picked it up at a local pharmacy and headed back to my conference in hopes I would be able to present at the poster session that evening.

One dose of maxalt provided relief in 30 mins to an hour. I was pain free all throughout my poster session and dinner with my colleagues that night. I smoked weed when I got home and went to bed. 

The next day I woke up with severe pain, the worst it had been all week. I took another maxalt, grabbed a latte and tried to brave my conference as this was the last day. I watched a couple talks before going to rest and pack up. The maxalt did nothing for my pain. I finished what I could of the conference and then my husband and I picked up a rental car to drive to our next hotel for our planned vacation to glacier national park.

I took another maxalt on the drive 24 hr after my first dose, pain was moderate for most of the drive and the maxalt did not help.

The next day I woke again with severe pain. I took a maxalt and hit the road for our planned boat tour and hike. I want to stress how excited I was for this hike - I had it planned for 8 months and glacier has always been on my bucket list. I was optimistic I could push through the pain. 

I vomited twice that morning after taking the maxalt with only water in my stomach. I managed to eat breakfast (biscuits and gravy) and keep that down. I started the boat tour with minimal pain (a 2 or 3)

did okay for 2/3 of the hike up, pain constant at a 2/3. Stopped a lot on the way and drank plenty of water, but no food. I had no appetite at this point. In the last 1/3 of the hike up I started to have severe migraine pain, at a 10, and I was extremely nauseous. I vomited near the top and then was able to make it to the final view. 

We rested for 45 min at the top and I felt refreshed enough to start the hike down which went okay, moderate pain and minimal nausea until we got to the very bottom, then nausea got much worse. 

I vomited waiting for our return boat to where our car was parked and dry heaved the entire drive home. At this point I decided to go to the ER if for nothing else than to get nausea meds and an IV as I was dehydrated from not being able to keep down water

I received the migraine cocktail at the ER which helped my nausea and brought the headache pain back down to moderate but did not cure me. I believe the cocktail had Benadryl, regalin, and dexamethasone. 

The next day I rested all day, ate when I could, and stayed in the dark hotel room. Pain was moderate, minimal if lying down. The day after that we drove back down the mountain to fly home. pain was at 4/5 the whole time. We missed our connecting flight and ended up renting a car to get home

I had a CT the day after I got home which came back normal. I have tried maxalt once more and it still did nothing to help. Two days after arriving home I started to get severe neck and shoulder pain along with the headache pain. The neck and shoulder pain responds to NSAIDs but I’ve been taking them every 4-6 hours for a few days. 

I am now sitting at moderate pain in my head, the neck and shoulder pain is intermittent but still responds to NSAIDs and I am waiting to schedule with a neurologist. In the meantime I have started daily magnesium pills (taken with a meal) and electrolyte drink mixes, just one a day, with plenty of water. I also still drink caffeine in my coffee in the morning and a carbonated beverage in the afternoons. 

I’ve spent the last 4 days hiding in my dark room, sleeping a lot, and eating when I can, but the only way I can get myself to eat is if I smoke weed. 

If you have read this far thank you for listening to my saga. I hope someone out there can relate and offer some advice or words of encouragement that this will pass. 

I am feeling hopeless and frustrated as I live my life on the side lines. I just want to be back to “normal”",1,1758472934.0,migraine,0,0.99,False

Looking for a little advice on how to handle a situation. Sorry if this post is long! 
I’m not looking for any help on how to repair the friendship or to be told to end the friendship, in my head i’ve already decided to distance myself from her.

A little background, her and I were very close, went to school together, spent every weekend at her place studying for registration exams and were each others go to people. However over the last few months, I’ve been coming to the realization that I don’t align with the type of person she is and i don’t feel like I am being the best version of myself when i’m around her. A few months ago, she made me go to this bar that we knew my ex would be at (yes I could’ve refused to go, in hindsight i should’ve stood up for myself) and then left me alone talking to strangers while she chased after some guy she was into. Over the last month she’s been flaking on plans super last minute, or making plans to get coffee later in the day and then going silent with no follow up. I understand things come up and people have busy lives, but it feels like she doesn’t respect my time at all.

I want to distance myself from this friendship but unsure how to start. I can’t go silent because she will continue to text and call me regularly. But if i bring up the issue directly, she is the type to get very defensive, view everything as an argument and has the need to get the last word. When she’s asked me for help on replying to people she may have issues with she has literally said “I want to make them feel stupid”. I just can’t be around it anymore.

Any ideas on how I can approach this with her? Our mutual friend is hosting a party in a couple weeks that I know we will both be attending and I really don’t want this to be blown out of proportion.",1,1758472487.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

1nmwkx8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nmwkx8,I have a theory on Pochita and how it connects to the two choices which Denji has.,"Pochita is orange. Orange is a fruit. Fruits grow on trees. Trees are on the ground. Ground is weak to ice. Ice is cold. Steve Austin is Stone Cold. Stones are hard. Skyrim is hard. Skyrim has 6 letters. 6 comes before 7. 6 7. Mango and Mustard. Mustard is yellow. Denjis hair is yellow. This means that Denji is mustard. But who is mango? 

Pochita is a dog. Dogs fuck white women. White women love starbucks. Starbucks makes coffee. Coffee is bitter. Denji doesnt like coffee. Power doesnt like it either. Power was reincarnated cause of Pochita. Power's devil form looks like a cat. Cats are the opposite of dogs and Denji is the dog. So who is Denji's Mango and Cat?

Mangos are grown in the summer. Summer is hot. Fire is hot. Fire Devil asks Denji about two choices. Those two choices are similar to Mango and Mustard, as well as Cat and Dog.

My theory is that the two choices will be either Denji chooses Mustard and Dog, which means himself. This means that Denji brings back Nayuta, the dogs, his old house, etc.

And if Denji chooses Mango and Cat, this means that he will choose the other option, which will be someone else...But finally, who is Mango and Cat?

When we look at a keypad, to spell out mango, we need to type ""61646"". When we take away 1 and 4, we get 666. 666 obviously references to the devil. This means that Denji's Mango and Cat will be a devil. And when you look at volume 14...Its Lil' D the Death Devil...

This means that either Denji chooses his old life with Nayuta or chooses to fuck Death Devil. 

Which will he choose? We will have to wait for him to choose. ",6,1758472363.0,Chainsawfolk,6,0.88,False

https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/s/6Ac2ED7l2e

I can't tell you all how amazing it is to have so much support with this.   It's so heartwarming.   This honestly has been the worst week of my life.  I've never known real heartbreak before.  It's AWFUL.  You can't escape it, it's all consuming.   My friends said they never thought they'd see me like this.    In the past Ive been hurt or sad (especially from JF) but could pull myself together and push forward with a smile and keep going.   But this past week, I couldnt even fake smiling.  I feel like I finally understand what heartbreak really is.  I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy.  

Hottie picked me up last night and the car ride was awkward.  Even the first 15-30 minutes at the restaurant were kind of tense.   I'm normally a very yappy and bubbly person, but I was quiet, reserved and guarded.  He asked me what was wrong, but I just shook my head, because how do you say to someone, ""oh, I just cried myself to sleep ever night for the past week, over you, so I'm a little messed up right now"".  

Finally, after way too much small talk, he brought it up.  

He told me that a mutual friend in their College guys group told him about my message to JF,  and how pissed JF is.  The friend said JF had always talked about me being in his future, but he also said he understands that Hottie wouldn't have know that.  Hottie only heard JF talk about me, when he was visiting MY hometown, so thought it was casual.  

And during our college days, when he and JF were super tight, Hottie remembers our long distance off and on thing, but he also remembers JF's local girlfriends, between our off and on days.  JF is an extreme ladies man.  Girls fall at his feet.  

I fessed up to Hottie, that during the last couple years, JF and I barely saw each other (we live in different states) but his sporadic messages talked about us getting married, when he was done grad school.  JF had asked me to move to his state (only 2-3 hours away)   I said no, and that he should move to me.  JF said he'd consider it when he was done school.    I told Hottie that I was an active participant of these conversations,  but:  

#1. I never initiated them, 
#2.  The messages were very sporadic, like 1x every 3-4 months, like a ""check-in"" 
#3.  I really didnt believe him at all,  I just went along with it.  
#4.  Once I started spending time with Hottie, even before we became romantic, I never ever said anything to JF about ""our future"".   

To be clear, once Hottie and I were romantically involved, I didnt have ANY communication with JF.  He didnt reach out to me during that time,  and I didnt reach out to him.  The first time I heard from him was last week, when he was coming to town and I had offered to meet him for coffee (to tell him about Hottie).  

I told him Hottie I honestly felt that JF was just keeping me as a backup plan.  If JF really cared about me, we'd just be together long distance.  We didn't live THAT far apart.  But he'd say he only wanted to be together, when we lived in the same city, because we tried long distance before and it didnt work.  Reality check:  ""we"" didnt work.   I should have stopped the silly future daydreaming but I thought it was harmless and the only person who could get hurt from it was me. 

I apologized to Hottie for not being fully transparent,  and for coming between him and his friend.   He should have known the full story to make his decision.   He thanked me for telling him everything now, and also thanked me for apologizing.  He was a little stunned with my confession and said it made him feel like a bigger ass to JF. 

He then said he was now conflicted with what to do.  His intentions for the night were to see if we could get back together, officially this time, no sneaking around.  But with the new info it made him feel worse about bro-code.

That DEVESTATED me.  But I understood it, and felt I deserved it.   

We have the same group of friends, in town (this is not JF's group) and decided that we'll just put the past behind us, be mature, and move forward as friends since we'll keep running into each other.  

We finished dinner and there was no more awkwardness or tension.   It's so easy with him so it just felt natural.   After dinner he suggested that we go for a walk.  Sure, we always enjoyed walks together.

We walked and talked for HOURS.   Talked about everything other than ""us"". It was like we didn't want the night to end because we didn't want to say goodbye. 

Finally, in the early hours of the morning we went to the car so he could drive me home.   When we got to my place we talked for another 20 minutes.  It started to get awkward, like how do we actually say goodbye?  Then he said ""f*ck this, I dont care anymore,  do you think we should just be together???""

My heart stopped.  I said ""Of course I do!   Dont forget JF has a girlfriend!  He and I will never talk and likely never see each other again, he lives 200 miles away.""   But I reminded him that this will affect his friendships in his college guys group.    I told him that he needs to decide, now that he has all the information.  

He said that group only gets together a few times a year, as most of them live in different cities and states.  The other guys wont hold it against him, but things will be awkward with JF for awhile.   

He's closer with our mutual friend group, that is in our town, anyway. 

He said he'd is call JFs bestie in the morning, to tell him we are officially getting back together,  and he's asking the bestie for advise: if he should call JF or message JF to tell him.    Messaging sounds like the cowardly way but he knows JF well enough to think JF would prefer that.   He'll do what the bestie thinks is best.  

I told Hottie I don't want us to say we are back together until he tells JF, in case he changes his mind.  My emotions can't do a roller-coaster again.   I can't get my hopes up.  

So we finally said goodbye (i would have slept in the car to avoid it), and he said he'll call me when its done.    One sweet kiss, that took my breath away, and I went into my home, alone. 

Now I feel numb.   I'm waiting to hear from him.   And no matter how hard I try to be calm,  my hopes are already up.......

Is it best to meet at a swinger's club, a coffee shop, a restaurant for dinner or at a couples private home?  

Picking the right spot that feels secure with the right vibe for first meets is important, as both couples are nervous and are filled with anticipation that they might make an amazing four way connection and be on the right path to achieving amazing ""friend's with spicy benefits."" 

Choosing a neutral, comfortable environment where both couples feel secure is essential, as they explore the upside down pineapple world of dating, and determine if there is a connection.  This means a location with good food and drinks that can loosen the conversation and just enough privacy that dirty little secrets can be whispered.

Chemistry is everything, so lean into the sparks, but don't force it, a relaxed, no pressure setting facilitates open and honest discussions, regarding sexual identity, sexual play preferences, full-swap/soft swap conversations and STI prevention practices. 

Flexibility is another consideration because if there is a lot of flirting and spiciness throughout the date, the date may call for spontaneity, while other times there may be a slow build of anticipation towards organic intimacy. Should the date be close to a hotel space, or a possible invite back to a home, or a lifestyle club. 

Remember the first date is necessarily about sealing the deal,  consider the intended outcome of the first date that was discussed prior to meeting the other couple; whether that means turning the next page together, exploring deeper desires, or deciding that friendship is the best fit.

1nmwdy8,https://www.reddit.com/r/HotColdTruth/comments/1nmwdy8/reveal_the_best_coffee_maker_experience_with/,Reveal the Best Coffee Maker Experience with Nespresso Vertuo Plus?,"Using the Nespresso Vertuo Plus Deluxe Coffee and Espresso Maker by Breville has been quite the experience for me as a coffee enthusiast. From the sleek design to its remarkable performance, this machine has earned its spot on my kitchen counter. At first glance, it’s clear that this isn't your average coffee maker—it’s a gateway to a café-quality experience at home. Balancing innovation and convenience, it feels like a treat every time I use it. While I was overall satisfied, there are a couple of things to keep in mind before diving in.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The design is sophisticated, with clean lines and a minimalist aesthetic that easily blends into any kitchen setting. The black finish looks sharp, and it doesn’t show fingerprints as much as I feared. The extra-large 60-ounce water tank is a big win, saving me the hassle of constant refills. It swivels, which makes it super convenient to position according to counter space. The build feels sturdy—nothing flimsy here—but the machine does take up a bit of space. For anyone with a smaller kitchen, that might be something to consider.

**Ease of Use**  
I cannot stress how straightforward the operation of this espresso machine is. One button. That’s all you need to brew coffee or espresso. The Nespresso Vertuo Plus reads the barcode on each pod, automatically adjusting for size and brew type. You don’t have to fiddle with settings or guess measurements; everything is tailored for perfection. Even my tech-phobic mother, who visited last month, managed to brew her own latte without needing my help—a true testament to how user-friendly this machine is!

[Check Nespresso Vertuo Plus Deluxe Coffee and Espresso Maker by Breville deal on Amazon.](https://designmara.com/p/b01n5s8tv1/)

**Performance**  
The machine’s performance exceeded my expectations. It heats up in just 25 seconds, which is perfect for those rushed mornings when you desperately need caffeine. It can brew in four cup sizes: 5oz and 8oz coffee, as well as single and double espresso shots. Pouring coffee over ice to make my favorite iced latte was a breeze. Each brew strikes an excellent balance between creamy and robust flavors, a testament to its brewing precision. However, I noticed it’s a tad noisy during the brewing process, which might be a small annoyance for light sleepers in the household.

**Versatility for Coffee Lovers**  
What stands out is the versatility. You can enjoy bold, mild, hot, or iced coffee—all at the touch of a button. My personal favorite has been mixing the single espresso with ice and milk for an easy weekday treat. The machine adapts to different pods, making it feel like a barista in a box. It also came with a variety of complimentary starter pods, which was instrumental in helping me discover my favorite flavors. That said, this convenience is heavily reliant on Nespresso pods, which might make it less appealing to those who love grinding their own beans.

**Highlights**  
- Simple one-button operation with barcode scanning technology.  
- Adjustable water tank to fit counter space needs.  
- Quick preheating in just 25 seconds.  
- Variety of brew sizes for different preferences.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- The noise level during brewing might bother some.  
- Limited to using Nespresso pods, which can get pricey over time.  

**Competitors**  
When comparing it to other single-serve coffee machines like the Keurig K-Elite or De’Longhi Dedica, the Nespresso Vertuo Plus offers superior quality in terms of taste and crema. However, the Keurig stands out for its compatibility with a wider range of pods, including reusable ones, which is more environmentally friendly. The De'Longhi, on the other hand, provides a traditional espresso-making experience, which might be preferable for purists. Where the Nespresso shines is in its automation and consistent results, which neither the Keurig nor the De’Longhi fully matches.

**Bang for the Buck**  
When weighing its cost against other coffee makers, the Nespresso Vertuo Plus feels like a worthwhile investment. It brings café-quality coffee into the home while cutting down on time and effort. The durable build and automatic features reduce long-term frustrations, though the reliance on proprietary pods does boost the recurring cost. Still, if you value convenience, flavor, and versatility, the quality justifies the price point.

**Prologue**

“Hello, Myrella. You’re watching this because he’s dead again.”

My nails sank into the wood of the chair, my consciousness fading in and out of existence. The sight of the girl on the screen made me want to wretch.

She was covered in blood, hair wild and unkempt like she’d just gotten out of a fight, and eyes shot. High. She visibly shook, her voice thin and frail.

“There are electric obituaries now. Once a person's heart stops, their direct family is notified. Authorities, too. You don’t have much time until the police get there.”

She kept picking at her skin, the obvious marks of an addict too lost in the drug to feel the pain. Watching this made my broken ribcage constrict. Like I was being wrung until I felt wetness in my eyes.

“I’ve set it all up for us. Me. You. You’ve nothin’a worry about.” She was slurring her words. “If he’s dead, you can go away. Get a drip, then forget. It will be a struggle to reset, but it’s better than the old life we lived.”

She took out a bunch of papers and what looked like a syringe and an IV drip. “Go to this address and use the drip. The note on the papers will tell you what to do. Keep the TV on. Those will be your new memories.”

Frozen with tears running down my face.

“You have to stop being Myrella, and get out of Roots. It’s the only way to end this.”

**Chapter 1**

My earliest memory as a child was my dad telling me the fastest way to kill something special was comparing it to others. 

I’d been jealous of one of the kids’ toys in pre-school. She’d brought it with her and said her mom made it for her. It was an ugly raggedy doll made of stitched-up cloth, but back then, I remembered I’d been burning with envy. I wanted the doll. I wanted what she had—a mom who cared enough to stitch something special for her.

What did I do? I stole the doll. Brought it home with me only for my dad to find it.

“Myrella, where did you get this?” He’d asked sternly. He’d looked so disappointed in me—his usually tender gaze gone.

As a child, I had lied. “One of the girls at school gave it to me.”

He might have seen the very guilty look on my face because his glare softened. “No, she didn’t.” He’d knelt in front of me, stroking my cheek. “Now, tell me, why’d you steal this doll?”

I’d felt so awful that I couldn’t find words to justify why I did what I did. I’d cried while he pulled me into his arms, kissing my head. 

“It’s not fair I don’t have a doll my mom made.”

It wasn’t fair at all. I’d been too young to articulate what I really felt. What I’d actually felt was the unfairness of not having my own mom.

When I’d calmed down, my dad was kind enough to carry me over to the couch to lecture me. When he’d given me a piece of his mind and told me what I did was bad, I could remember his voice, his tone, his inflection clear as day: 

“The fastest way to kill something special is to compare it to others. You’re a special girl, Myrella. You’re beyond comparison.”

Ever since then, my memories of him had all been vivid…bright. I had a happy childhood despite not having a mom because of my dad. I just wished…

“Doctor Ella?”

I immediately looked up from my own drawing of a tree and flipped the journal close. 

“Yes, Kelly?”

The little girl’s bright hazel eyes were glistening with tears. 

“Malachi is being an asshole and stole my markers.” She wailed.

I had to hold my jaw tightly shut. Kids these days…

“Kelly, please, what did we say about using bad words?” Despite my question, I went straight to Malachi who was obliterating said markers. 

He was stabbing the papers using the tip until the ink sprayed red throughout the floor. 

“Malachi, stop,” I swiftly plucked the marker away from him. As soon as the thing was in my hand, he flew toward me and started hitting my thighs with his tiny fists.

“Give it back, give it back!”

In terror, Kelly began crying louder, running toward the corner of the room, covering her ears.

“Give it back, you bitch!” He continued to slam his fists against me.

The pain instinctively made me protective, but he was just a kid. He didn’t know any better. I caught his wrists and kneeled in front of him so we were eye-level.

He fought against me, inconsolable and babbling words he didn’t know the meaning of.

    “Malachi,” I crooned amidst his rage. “You have to stop this.” I wasn’t perfect. I admit that I was starting to get agitated at the noise and those tiny fingernails sinking into my skin.

How this boy had so much anger in him, I could never fathom. As he thrashed, I saw his lips screw up and—like a loaded gun—spat at me.

As the spittle trickled down my cheek, I clenched my jaw and forced myself to wipe it off. As soon as my hand lifted, the boy cringed away…preapred for any physical reprimand.

I let his other wrist go, straightened up, telling him firmly, “That was not nice, Malachi. You should never spit on people’s faces.” I sounded so responsible, so gentle, but inside I felt like I was combusting.

*It’s not his fault, it’s not his fault.*

The cacophony of footsteps, yelling, and that grating snooty voice of one of my colleagues assaulted me. 

“Jesus Christ, Ella!” The tall man in the doctor’s coat sent me a withering glare.

Malachi was shaking, curled on the floor, shielding his head from me.

My head began to pound at all the stress and I licked my dry lips.

“Check the tapes. He was…” *Being a brat.* “...having a bad day…”

One of the nursing assistants went over to the boy. Kelly, on the other side, watched us with wide, frightened eyes.

“Malachi,” she stroked the boy’s head. “Let’s go get some sweets on you, what do we say?”

*Sweets*. 

Something akin to talons gripped me by the neck. Betrayal. “No. We had an agreement you’re giving me *two* years with them. It hasn’t even been a year yet.”

Sweets meant medication. Something to temper down impulses and—more importantly—anger. They’d been rolling out so much shortcut medications to cure so many things that it was becoming apparent to me that nobody wanted to confront the truth anymore.

They’d rather cloak it with meds that messed with their heads.

“These kids are *traumatized*.” My voice shook. “They need *therapy*. Not some magic cure-all pill!”

Doctor Harlan, ever-so-stringent and blusterous, continued to glare. “Yeah, and I’m curing them, unlike you, Quack.” he sneered.

I lamented as the other woman walked away with the sniveling child. I was despairing. Not because the kid was gonna get medicated, but despairing that I’d failed helping him the way I wanted to.

“Jan, get the other kid to her room.” He said over his shoulder.

My body was cold and empty. I felt nothing and everything at the same time. I was so mad that the void was making it worse and worse.

“You,” he pointed at me. “My office. Now.”

Instinctively, my hand slipped into my pants pocket where my little yellow plastic bottle was. My fingers stroked over the plastic. A self-comforting behavior I discovered I had.

As long as this was with me, I was fine. The urge to pop in another was tempting, but not overconsuming.

*Not yet*. *Remember you‘re cutting down?*

Right.

The pompous doctor turned and strode away while I followed. I kept my chin up as the judgmental eyes of my peers seared into my skin. Like meat to a white-hot pan, I just had to silently hiss through the pain.

When the door closed behind us, cold fingers raked down my spine. 

“Sit down, Doctor Ella.”

“What changed your mind?” I couldn’t hold the sneer back as I made myself comfortable on the chair beside his table.

The medical director’s office wasn’t pristine. It was scattered with stacks of yellowing papers about to be thrown out. Everything was digital now.

“See, despite what I say and do outside, I’m not that big of a prick. We’re friends, remember?” His cheeky New York accent was beginning to bleed out.

“Fuck off.”

He chuckled as he sucked on his e-cigarette.

“I told you not to smoke around me.”

He shrugged, ignoring me. “It’s carcinogen-free *and* it’s flavored air. It’ll do you no harm.”

*Lies.* “Yeah, but the smell is vile.” I contested before he blew the smoke over to my direction just to spite me.

At least respecting my wishes, he set aside the thing and propped his legs up his table, ankles crossed.

“What am I going to do with you, Doc Ella?”

Harlan was a decent enough person, but sometimes, I couldn’t get rid of the feeling that he was stripping me of my clothes inside his head. With his deep hazel eyes, he looked like he always had something wicked in mind.

*Ew.*

“I don’t know what to tell you, Bradley. Malachi’s been difficult from the start, but it’s always going to be like this before it gets better. We just have to ride through the waves.”

His fingers twitched over his belly. “The kid’s broken, Ella. There’s no therapy that can fix him.”

“No, he’s not. And you better watch the way you speak about your patients.” 

He chuckled and threw his hands up. “Sue me for telling the truth. This gentle parenting shit ain’t doing us any good. My momma used to whoop me back in the day if I behaved like him.”

I seethed underneath my calm demeanor. “He’s been *whooped* many times, that's why he acts so defensively.”

“Gah, kids nowadays. So sensitive. Can’t take a good whooping and learn a lesson or two.” He grumbled and plucked a piece of paper on his desk.

Should I feel offended for these kids? Bradley wasn’t exactly wrong about the sensitive part.

“Here, I got this from the higher-ups. We’re cutting down budget for art therapy if we don’t see any promising results the next few months. We’re going through new management, yadda-yadda.”

“WHAT?!”

“Woman, we’re a legitimate medical asylum. *Medical*. If it weren’t for me pulling strings, your department wouldn’t even exist.”

Something ugly flared up inside me and I shot up from my seat, leaning over his table to stare him down. “Is this because you think I’m a quack?”

“Not me, darlin’. I think you’re a decent enough doctor.”

*Decent enough*. The bar was set so, so low that *decent enough* sounded like the highest praise you could get.

“I know you guys look down on me because you think I’m a hack, but I’m telling you, medication isn’t a cure-all.”

“Exactly what a quack would say.” He teased.

“Fuck you, Bradley Harlan. I’m going to prove you dick-swinging motherfuckers wrong.”

“I love your passion, Doc Ella. That’s why I kept ya. Don’t see that too much nowadays. Everybody’s so fucking blunted. I see you really wanna help, but management’s breathing down my neck. My hands are tied.”

“Management can go fuck themselves.” I muttered and dropped back down to my seat in dismay.

My body was responding to the anger I couldn’t feel. It shook, it sweated…but it just left me feeling like there was a void eating at me.

“Holistic medicine isn’t a scam. At least, not mine. The kids need a spiritual, creative outlet. Kelly’s been doing really well, Malachi’s just an exception. It means I haven’t been meeting what he really needs yet. I’ll figure it out. Give me time.” I pleaded with the frozen man in front of me.

His face was set grimly, and in this meager lighting, he looked like a brooding detective in a noir film instead of a stressed-out doctor.

“As a friend…” he trailed off, and I could see that he was apprehensive about what he was about to tell me. “I feel the need to let you know we’re rolling out the severa-methylyne drips for the kids.”

“Wh-what?” My heart cracked, feeling like it was going to break.

Severa-methylyne pills were used to treat addiction. Treating an addiction with another addiction. The drips were more potent. It had the power to alter memories of adults, and when used with kids…it could make them think of a whole other life.

The trauma forgotten in the mind, but still there in spirit and heart. It was like placing a bandaid over a gaping hole.

“This isn’t ethical, Bradley.” I choked out.

He just shrugged, not looking so happy about it himself. “I contested, but obviously, money wins.”

“When?”

He didn’t need me to elaborate. “In a few days.”

I ran my hands over my face, feeling the urge to cry. I had never felt so helpless before.

“Why wasn’t I informed earlier?”

“I’m just as surprised as you are, Ella.”

I had no words… “What makes you think this can help?”

“Research says so.”

“Research, my ass. What am I supposed to do?” I asked more to myself than him.

I felt his eyes measuring me up again, but this time, more clinical than anything else.

“You’re a good-looking woman, Ella. I’m a man, and I definitely am a victim to lust when it comes to you. Maybe use that to your advantage for once.”

I shot him a nasty look. “Fuck you, Bradley.”

“I’m serious! I heard the new executive is single. No wife. He has kids… You’re good with kids, right?”

“You’re saying I should fuck my way to the top?”

He shrugged and began smoking again. This time, I didn’t stop him. I was just as aggravated as he was.

“I need some air.” Without a look back, I walked out of his office and quickly popped a pill with trembling fingers.

I needed it right now. 

*Just one.*

**Chapter 2**

I never dreamed of random, unexplainable things. I always dreamed of memories I thought I’d forgotten. They were all so vivid and real that it would never leave my mind hours after I woke up. Like a movie I kept watching over and over again.

Last night, I dreamed of my dad. He was a great cook despite being a very science-driven man. In my child eyes, he’d always been the picture of health and happiness. In this natural light, the sun shone against his dark hair like a halo, his fork clinking lightly against the porcelain as he ate.

“I have to tell you something.” He said suddenly, fixing me a gentle look. 

“What?” My mouth moved without my permission.

“I’m seeing someone right now. She’s a really nice lady, you’ll like her.”

“Dad, why are you telling me this?”

“You’re my baby, and I know you’d be wary if I brought her here without telling you first.”

“I’m fifteen, not a baby.” I grumbled, but there was a bitterness swirling in my belly. I’d known my dad for so long and I’d never seen him with a woman before.

Why now?

“You’re a perceptive girl. You tell me if she’s for me, how about that?”

“I’m not a lie detector, dad.”

My voice echoed, and I was in the void again, the brightness of the scene snuffed out at the speed of light.

“Dad?” When my voice reverberated like this, I knew I was about to wake up. The void closed around me like a plastic bag over my face. I could hear the sound of my suffocation as I clawed at my throat. Grinding rocks, crinkling plastic, and unnatural, unsteady breaths. 

“DADDY!”

My head was pulsating painfully, my throat dry, but my mouth salivating. My stomach cramped hard, and as I curled over, my eyes opened to the sight of my sofa. 

Quickly, I ran to my bathroom and emptied the contents of my stomach. I worshipped the porcelain throne once again, quivering and weak, but at least I was provided temporary relief from my night of overindulgence.

As I brushed my teeth, I kept dry-heaving, feeling the need to throw up again as the thing hit the back of my tongue. I washed my face and looked up at the mirror.

I looked like shit.

My usually tan skin was sallow and sickly. I had dark circles under my eyes, and my curly dark hair molded to one side of my face like I’d just laid on that position for too long. I’d passed out drinking. I was lucky enough I didn’t choke on my own vomit.

Watching the streaks of light hitting my face, I stared again at my reflection. I was what they called racially ambiguous, but I knew for a fact my dad was white. That only had to mean my mother was mixed.

Bradley wasn’t lying though. If I cleaned my act up, I’d look pretty.

Right now I just looked pretty horrible.

At thirty-five, I’d resigned myself to the fact that I was going to live life as a miserable spinster. Might as well take advantage of what I was naturally gifted with to do some good.

I’d spent the entire night mulling over my options, and I’d drank myself to oblivion. My poison of choice? Beer. Cheap beer. It was the only smell of alcohol I could stand.

The rest—especially brandy—brought back too many negative feelings. Apart from making me want to puke, it made me palpitate just from its stench. A painful thumping feeling in my chest and gut. I had no idea why that was. I think it just smelled fucking disgusting.

I looked at my wall clock. God. It was an hour before work.

*I think I need to wear a skirt today.*

*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\**

For the first time in a while, I left my hair down as I came to work. It was weird stepping foot into the wellness center in heels, a tight-fitting skirt and combed-down hair.

“Ooo-weee, look at you, ready to take life by the dick and balls.” I heard Bradley crow from behind me.

He was at it again, acting like an unprofessional turd in front of *our* colleagues.  I understood that he had to be an asshole around others, but why would he nonchalantly out me like that? 

I was already struggling in my stilettos, and I had to push back the urge to slam the tip of my heel through one of his eyes.\`

I crossed my arms, cocking my head at him and his posses.

“Don’t you *medical* doctors have better shit to do than gossip in the reception area?”

It wasn’t Bradley who responded. It was a man I’d never seen before. Handsome…mid to late forties. Fit.

“Hi, you must be Doctor Ella Blake,” He said as he confidently strode toward me, hand outstretched for a shake.

My body moved on its own and we were shaking hands, the tension coursing in my veins hot. What was this feeling?

“Y-yes. You can call me Doc Ella.” I stuttered.

“I’m Hideo Omura,” He had a cheeky smile made his dimples flare.

Omura? This was… “You’re our new CEO?” I asked dumbly. I didn’t realize we were getting taken over by a corporation. Definitely not Reyes & Omura Psychiatry.

My eyes flickered toward Bradley who was not-so-subtly giving me a thumbs up.

“Yes.” He chuckled, nonplussed. “I’ve heard a lot of great things about you.”

My mood darkened, but my heart was slamming painfully against my ribcage. “Not great enough apparently. You cut my funding abruptly.” I bit back, and I felt the blood heat up my cheeks and neck.

“We’re a results-oriented company. High-percent positive outcomes drive more ROI. Your department’s simply not making the cut, so we had to drive more money into other avenues.”

“They are *people*. Not products.” I said through gritted teeth. His callous and direct way of breaking it down to me gave me whiplash. “And I haven’t been given much of a chance. This department’s been up not even a year yet.”

He seemed surprised at this. I used this to my advantage to drill my point in.

“You can’t expect me to give rapid results. I need to study each and every one of the patients. I don’t even get any assistance in my department.”

“Is that so?”

Adrenaline shot up my veins, making me giddy. “Yes, that budget was barely enough to help the department. If I was given the kind of resources I needed, I can give you those results.” Saying those words made me feel like I’d cemented my place in hell. More money wouldn’t help…but if I asked for a lot, I could bargain and keep my department open, at least.

Mister Omura smiled at me, touching my elbow. I jumped back, surprised.

“Sorry. Let’s have this conversation elsewhere.”

“No, I have a patient waiting for me…”

“Kelly? The CNA’s will handle her.”

*How does he know this?*

My breathing was starting to grow rapidly, sweat bleeding out of my pores. “You aren’t pulling her out of my program, right?”

“No, she’s not getting the sweets.” He reassured me, patting my forearm. I wasn’t sure how I felt with him just touching me so casually. Again, my eyes went back to Bradley. He was nodding his head encouragingly.

Mister Omura noticed who I was looking at and called me out. “You and Doctor Harlan have a thing?”

I bristled, disgusted. “Fuck no.”

“Doesn’t seem like it.”

His grin was disarming, and I felt something curl in my stomach. Absently, I swept a hand down my neck, uncertain.

“He and I are strictly platonic friends and colleagues.” I blurted out. I didn’t know why I sounded so defensive. Platonic. Hah! Harlan had never kept it a secret he wanted in my pants.

There was a presumptive tone in his voice like he knew for a fact I was lying. He was much taller than me so when his eyes swept up and down me, I knew he was appraising.

My molars ground together as my knees suddenly weakened. I had to tense up so I didn’t wobble and embarrass myself in these shoes. I stepped back, distancing myself from him.

For what seemed like forever, I breathed in. The rush of air in my lungs making my heart pound harder. There was something about Mister Omura that made it difficult to breathe.

“You look like a deer caught in headlights.” He chuckled lightly but kept his distance.

I curled my hands to fists, feeling them cold and sweaty. “I—no. It’s nothing.” I hated feeling this way. Too flustered to keep up a normal conversation. “Let’s go?”

His head inclined to the building exit then started walking ahead. I followed silently. I avoided directly looking at him, but I learned ignoring his imposing figure seemed so much worse.

He held the door open for me like a gentleman and I scuttled forward. I had this unreasonable compulsion about not wanting to turn my back on him, so I turned to wait for him to lead the way.

There was a calm, professional smile on my face, but right now, I was ice and fire. Cold to the touch, but I was burning with humiliation inside. I shouldn’t even be worrying about what my colleagues thought of me. They’d always thought I slept with Bradley to get my department. This show with Mister Omura would only cement that wrong assumption.

*Principles won’t save the kids. You work with what you have, Myrella.*

In front of me, Mister Omura stopped to wave me to his side. The brilliant red, pink, blue lights every building seemed to have made his trimmed dark hair lustrous. Almost glowing. He wasn’t wearing that stiff corporate suit. Just a blue button-down, dark khakis and leather shoes. Tasteful.

He had a small crooked smile on, teasing me. “Come on, I don’t like turning my back on anyone. Not anyone as beautiful as you.”

My pace hastened as I caught up to him amidst the bustle of people. I just rode out his comment about me. “I don’t like turning my back on people, too.”

Dimples flaring once again, I felt the urge to rip my hair from its roots before brushing it off. The shame of what I was doing made me ill…but I’d rather be successful in this endeavor than embarrass myself more with failure.

So I sucked it up.

*I’m fine. I’m fine.*

“See, the two of us are like two peas in a pod.”

I shuffled awkwardly. “Right.”

He touched my arm again, and right now, I was prepared. I wasn’t as taken aback, but more surprised that he’d try again so soon.

He nodded toward a nearby fancy café. “Coffee?” Then pointed at a bar on the other side of the street. “Or something stronger?”

For a split second, my life stood still. Pausing as my brain short-circuited. It was a source of shame for me. I was a slave to substances, and that included alcohol. I couldn’t go through this blarily blind again.

“Coffee would be great.” My smile was forced as I hurried my way inside the shop and ordered before I could even take a seat. I needed to before I changed my mind.

“Hi Carol, you look glum today.”

The barista knew me from my occasional visits.

“What’s new? Same old shit everyday. You’re not looking too bad though, Doc. The usual?”

“Yes, please.” I breathed out and went to the farthest part of the shop where I couldn’t see the glow of the liquor bar across the street.

*Out of sight, out of mind.*

I didn’t know why I was so cold today. I shouldn’t have worn the fucking skirt. It just made me feel naked in this perpetually gloomy weather. Consciously, I pulled the skirt down, adjusting so I wasn’t flashing everyone.

Mister Omura ordered his drink and waved at me. 

I didn’t respond, just studied his movements. He had a carefree aura to him that called to me. If it weren’t for his name, I wouldn’t have known he was a corporate tycoon. He was too…*loose* to be one.

My fingernails clacked repeatedly on the table. I couldn’t tell what I was feeling right now. My heart had already steadied its rhythm. As I grew more accustomed to the fact that I was potentially whoring myself out to keep my department open, the less I wanted to scalp myself.

He sauntered over to where I was seated—a swagger to his steps. It was unsettling how attractive he was.

It was as if someone was breathing down my neck as I licked my lips. A cold, dead finger trailed down my spine as he smiled smugly at how I watched him.

Arrogant and attractive. Great.

He dragged the chair away from the table, creating a grating noise that rankled in my head. It was a pet peeve of mine. Why couldn’t they just lift the chair up to move it?

“What are you willing to do?”

“Excuse me?”

“I said, what do you want me to do?”

I blinked in confusion. I must have misheard him. 

“Look, Mister Omura, let me just shoot it straight. We need talk and art therapy sessions open. My department is the only one that isn’t relying on any kind of medication. These kinds of treatments take time and dedication. It isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution like the *sweets*.”

He nodded, looking open to what I was telling him. “That is true. How many patients were under your care?”

There was something wrong with that question. My brain couldn’t think of an answer. I was afraid to knock on my temple and hear that it was hollow and empty.

“There’s Malachi and Kelly.” I said, my throat dry.

“You weren’t given enough opportunity to help. You feel like they are restricting you, and more so now.”

“Y-yes! Exactly.” My head bobbed up and down enthusiastically. At least he understood this. “How am I supposed to give results when I’m being treated unfairly?”

His dark eyes narrowed. “Because they call you a quack doctor, correct?”

My shoulders slumped. “That, too. I was…” I racked my head for my history. It shouldn’t be this hard to remember, but I’d been too numbed-out by my pill cocktail. “I have a doctorate in social work and holistic medicine.”

“Why call it medicine when you don’t believe in it?”

I felt attacked by his words. Oh, yes, I believed in the power of medication. Too much. I just didn’t trust it. They were lacing something in them to make us need it.

A sudden spurt of indignance made me brattily blunt. “Don’t argue semantics with me, Mister Omura. I know well enough that you need customers and you’re making the people addicted.” If I started ranting about mind control and totalitarian rulers, he would think I was insane.

“I just…the kids…they need some other outlet that isn’t suppressing their emotions. Creating something, expressing, breathing exercises…it can help heal a slew of issues.”

“You’re just an optimistic heart-bleeding humanitarian, aren’t you?” There was no condescension in his tone. Just a deadpan observation.

“I just want to help.” The beginnings of a craving was gnawing at me. I was getting too stressed. Too uncomfortable. My hand slipped into my pocket, hoping touching the bottle was enough.

Mister Omura’s eyes were sharp as a hawk’s. “Are you saying this from personal experience?”

“The fuck do you mean?” My voice was shrill. Irritated.

He was unfazed by my hostility. “I saw you avoiding the sight of liquor. I see the way you self-soothe by holding onto what’s inside your pocket. What is it? Hydros? Your pupils are constricted.”

“That’s none of your business.” I snarled.

“It is my business. It’s my money that’s gonna be funding this—” he waved his hands about. “—this art department of yours.”

I didn’t have enough fuel for anger, so instead, I said, “You want me to admit I’m a hypocrite.”

“Nothing so malicious.” He suddenly reached out to touch my other hand. “I was an alcoholic before. Brandy was the temple of my sanity. I’m not here to judge.”

My heart rate spiked so fast and loud, I could barely hear his words.

“I just want the truth, Myrella. Didn’t your parents ever tell you it’s not good to lie?”

“W-what?”

He just called me Myrella. It hit something deep in me, triggering a comforting memory of dad calmly educating me it was bad to lie.

“If I’m putting money on you, I need your honesty.”

“No. I need a guarantee. If I’m honest, we’re keeping the department open. That we’re getting enough funding.”

His fingers curled around mine, and I released a breath. Something was swirling in my belly, and I wasn’t sure if they were snakes or butterflies.

“What are you willing to do, Myrella?”

My pores tightened, the hairs of my skin moving to stand on end like it was being pulled by static.

I was sure I heard him correctly now. “I’m willing to be honest that yes, I am on something. I have a problem, but I know what I’m doing, Mister Omura. I…*function* with it.”

His gaze raked over me and I had to look away.

“I need to know if this is worth the investment.”

My eyes flickered back to him. I wanted to throw up at what I was about to say. “It’s worth it. I’ll do anything.”

There was a flash in his eyes that my brain was quick enough to catch.

1nmw95l,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskGaybrosOver30/comments/1nmw95l/struggling_to_maintain_friendships_with_gay_guys/,Struggling to maintain friendships with gay guys,"I’ve been exploring sexually the last couple of years, and recently I have ended up in a relationship of 6 months with a guy for the first time, and came out as bi to most of my friends and family. 

When ex hookups/fwbs have reached out to me I’ve told them the situation. Most of them continued to lightly test boundaries or straight up didn’t acknowledge them to which I just blocked them. Some of them were respectful and we have remained in touch. We chat about our daily lives, interests, how relationships are going and that kinda thing.

However I have noticed that whenever I reach out to them for any sort of platonic activities.. concerts, gym, food/coffee etc. I’m just hit with a brick wall. One guy initially said he wanted to go to a show with me but later told me he changed his mind and just hit me with “I am your friend yes, but, I also like you so I think I have that hope to do/have something else with you and that’s not really a friendship tho because I don’t really fancy my friends … so I think is better to stay away from each other.”

I have had a few other similar experiences like this.. and whilst I respect them for keeping distance to avoid any temptations or whatever.. it also just gives me the impression that they are just keeping me around in the hope that I’ll break up with my bf and hookup with them again. 

It just makes me feel a bit objectified, some people are fine with that but it does bother me quite a lot. Is this just the nature of hookup culture, or is it a me problem? 

I’m curious about other peoples experiences.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )
