Hello r/stopdrinking, 

&nbsp;
 
TL;DR I'm putting this at the top because I know this is long. At the end of March my wife was in the hospital for about a week and a half, but sent home and improving. In the middle of April she was back in the hospital for abdominal pain. A few days later she was in a coma. A few days after that she passed away. This was entirely avoidable, and I want anyone who reads this to understand what they could be doing to themselves. She was only 36 years old.

&nbsp;

I want to share with you a cautionary tale about how quickly things can go off the rails. This is for all of you, but my hope is that it resonates with people like myself - the ones who think there's still time, the ones who are always waiting for that one thing or moment when reality will hit you and you'll change what you're doing.

 &nbsp;

I've been lurking on this sub for years because I've wanted to quit myself. Day to day my responsibilities were handled without alcohol, but fun events that we were supposed to do together often got ruined by our drinking habits. We'd wake up too hungover to do what we'd planned, or we'd drink too much on a vacation to remember much of it or even worse, we'd have a drunken argument about something that didn't matter and it would ruin the moment. 

 &nbsp;

As for my wife, her drinking seriously accelerated when her youngest sibling died of suicide, a little over three years ago. On my own days off I would do chores around the house and errands that we needed to get done. Unknown to me was that on my wife's days off, she was drinking (not every day off, but at this point it was about every other day off). I remember when I'd get home from work and she was completely coherent and we would be a drink or two in when I'd wonder how she seemed to get drunk so fast. Maybe I was being blind, I don't know. I only figured out she was drinking on her days off when I started finding empty wine bottles stashed in places she thought I wouldn't find them. 

 &nbsp;

During these past few years she also was still handling certain responsibilities without fail. She handled our budgeting and paying our bills, did very well for herself at her profession, and on the days away from work that she wasn't day drunk she was handling things that needed to be handled. On that last point though, one day off from work that she would do what we needed was enough for me to forget the last three or four times that she didn't do anything except drink. That was probably a failure on my part, but our good times were always so great and we were really good at letting go of bad feelings and forgiving each other.

 &nbsp;

By 2024 it was just a revolving door of everything above. One day we were talking on the phone during my lunch break and we'd decided that we were going to have pizza for dinner (one of those frozen ones). I got home from work that night and could immediately smell something burning. When I got to the kitchen I saw the oven was on and when I opened it there was a burnt to a crisp pizza. I took it out and turned the oven off and then went upstairs to the bedroom, where she was passed out on the bed. I changed out of my work clothes and that was about the time she woke up, completely unaware of the pizza for a few moments until she smelled the burnt smell. 

 &nbsp;

That's just one story of so so many. I'd be so upset about things like this that I'd demand we stop drinking immediately and because she felt bad about whatever had happened she'd always agree, and it would last maybe two or three days before it was back to the usual. 

 &nbsp;

This is all a lot of lead up to what eventually happened, but I hope it can illustrate how probably a lot of us feel about drinking and alcoholism at a relatively young age. ""There's time to stop,"" ""I'm young enough to move on from this... eventually,"" and everything else we tell ourselves (me included, I'm no hypocrite.)

 &nbsp;

This year 2025, January 28th my wife woke up to get ready for work after I'd already left. It was the anniversary of the loss of her sibling, which she never really got over. She decided to take a shot before she left and that one shot unfortunately cost her the job that she loved so much. It threw us into a bit of a tailspin financially, but it wasn't enough for her to stop drinking and being home everyday increased the alcohol intake. 

 &nbsp;

During the next couple of months she applied to a lot of jobs but mostly wouldn't get out of bed for much else. I know what it's like to feel the devastation of losing what you think is your perfect job and that's what I thought was happening. What neither of us knew is that her body was breaking down. I could go much further into detail about that, but for now I won't simply because at the time, the signs weren't really clear when we didn't know what we were even supposed to notice.

 &nbsp;

At the end of March 2025, I took my wife to the ER. She was badly constipated and having abdominal pain. She was admitted and stayed in the hospital for 10 days. During that stay she was confused about a lot of things and not herself. At one point she called me at work to tell me about something she thought was going on at our home and got upset with me when I told her she was at the hospital and not home. She insisted she was home and I should believe her.

 &nbsp;

Her doctors explained to me that she was in the beginning stages of liver failure, but because of her age and because there was no scarring on her liver she would be fine... if she stopped drinking. When they told me that, in front of her, she was too incoherent to understand what they'd said. As the last doctor walked out of the room she said to me ""I didn't even hear what he said"" and laughed - and me, not knowing any better I chalked that up to pain meds.

 &nbsp;

By the end of her hospital stay, she was improving. She was no longer having delusions and she was feeling much better. I took her home from the hospital and the very first thing she did when she got home was start drinking again. I told her that the doctors said she needed to stop and her reply was ""they said I need to cut down."" Despite her continuing to drink she showed improvement for a few days. 

 &nbsp;

About mid-way through April things got significantly worse, physically speaking. On April 16th I demanded that if I got home from work the next day and there was no improvement I would be taking her back to the hospital. Stubborn as always, she said ""You know I won't go."" The next morning before I got up for work she asked me to take her to the ER because her abdominal pain was so severe. 

 &nbsp;

Here's where things go so quickly. It was about 9am when I brought her to the ER. I left the hospital at about 8pm. During those 11 hours she went from coherent to not so much, and again I thought it was just pain meds. On this day, when she still seemed in her right mind, one of the last things she said to me was ""I'm so sorry I didn't listen to you."" The situation didn't feel serious, to me it was more like fine, she'll get some treatment and be home in no time. So her apology at the time seemed unwarranted because I didn't think she had anything to be sorry for. Just another thing we'd navigate through and get past. 

 &nbsp;

I went to work the next morning because I didn't know... anything really. It all seemed so routine. After work when I went to see her she was able to identify me, and answer all the other questions they ask in a hospital to make sure you're mentally okay. The one exception is that she was having trouble answering her birthday and the current year. When the nurse asked her birthday she'd get through the month, day and then half of the year before trailing off. When the nurse would ask her birth year again she would laugh and say ""sorry, 2025."" This went on for a minute before she said her whole birthday. I went home that night again feeling like it was just painkillers doing what they do.

 &nbsp;

The next day I didn't have to work, so I went to see her pretty early. She was awake but absolutely out of it. This was the day that one of her ~~oncologists~~ gastoenterologists told me that her liver had failed and she had approximately three to six months to live in her current state. That if she stopped drinking and managed to live a full six months she could be a candidate for a liver transplant, and that her kidneys were only working at 30%. She wasn't able to hold her arms up and her fingers couldn't hold on to anything. She spilled coffee on herself, she spilled one of her liquid meds on herself and by this time the nurses were hand feeding her. 

 &nbsp;

The day after this I arrived back at the hospital just in time to see them wheeling her out of her room. I followed behind as they were taking her to the ICU, and once there they explained that she'd fallen into a coma and her life expectancy was less than a month. At times it appeared that she was looking at me but there was no verbal or physical response. 

 &nbsp;

It just got quickly worse. The next day her life expectancy was one to two weeks. The day after it was a week or less. A couple days later and she had passed away, on April 26th, just two days before our 12th wedding anniversary. She was only 36 years old.

 &nbsp;

Her death was due to acute liver failure. For those of you who are around our ages, her 36 and me 42, please understand that you don't know how much time you have left to fix this. Acute liver failure can happen seemingly overnight. 

 &nbsp;

One thing that will always bother me about all of this is something my wife said to me so many times: ""we can't just stop, I'm scared that we'll have a stroke or something if we just quit"" and in the end, it turns out my response to that was right: ""if this continues one of us will die anyway so why not try to just quit?""

 &nbsp;

I know something about that sounds wrong... in what way I cant identify at the moment.  Cliche? Easier said than done? I don't know. All I can tell you is that I've lost my best friend and the love of my life, and I truly feel like if she knew what the end of this was maybe something would be different now.

1kwlmup,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hashimotos/comments/1kwlmup/scared_of_pictures_tired_hate_how_i_look_hate_how/,Scared of Pictures. Tired. Hate How I look. Hate how I feel. Rant.,"I mean, I've never been crazy about them, even since I was a little kid.
But I'm now 27, and while I'm ok with people taking pictures of me... I just don't want to see them. I won't even scroll through someone's phone if they hand it to me. I've mastered the art of looking like I'm not looking. 

And it sucks, because I know I'll want these pictures when I'm older. I would like a record of being here, doing things I like, with people I love.

But it's really upsetting. It was always something - my teeth, this birthmark, then it was how big my chest was from age 11-24. I don't even want to go into detail - I just wanted them chopped off. 

Finally my family got in a place to pay for a breast reduction and I wish I took more pictures then. I was ecstatic. I could finally wear clothes I liked. It was amazing. I could finally fit into a swimsuit! A normal shirt! Could see my toes! Recovery was ass but so worth it. I was so happy. 

It didn't last long. I kept gaining weight, and people around me said it was normal after surgery; that the ""fat would redistribute"". So wrong - and I was achy, and getting acne, and I've always had dry skin and struggled with seborrheic dermatitis, but that was the first time in my life that I'd consistently wake up with itchy skin from dryness and a dry mouth - and people were still telling me I was imagining it, and sending me weight loss pdfs, and YouTube links to the Glucose Guardian. So insane! 

Thank god my partner realized - how little I ate, and how much I was gaining, and encouraged me to get second, third opinions. Finally found an Endo that would acknowledge the weight gain and not just imply that I wasn't really exercising or eating properly - bam, it was hyperthyroidism, and a month later when I could pick up my antibody test, yep - hashimoto's. 

Sucks. No one near me in the family has this. Thank god it's not diabetes, which we do have a history of. But then the number just kept going up and they wanted me to stay on the dosage longer even if I still felt like more and more crap - then they raised it, but too little too late, I have the beginnjngs of an apron belly, my thighs won't fit into slacks, and I have had to change underwear sizes three times.

I can't even bring myself to buy a bra with wire again, even though I know I need one now. I was at the department store yesterday and had to swallow tears. All that money and effort and dreaming, wasted. 

And I'm trying so hard. My partner makes sure I eat so healthily. Cooks quinoa more than rice, and I've even started making my own yogurt, and I try to get at least stretches in if I can't full on exercise because even a 10 minute low impact workout leaves me achy and sore if not horribly itchy. It's a new thing, just itching down my back and legs, even if I haven't sweated yet, even if I just do some cleaning, it's awful.

Don't want to pay for tirzepatide yet. Not covered by any health insurance and it's expensive here. Dosage sort of stabilized 2 months ago, but then I think I veered towards almost hyperthyroidism - without any weight loss, plus the anxiety, so we're monitoring again. Cutting stuff out of my diet isn't super feasible at the moment, financially or logistically.

When I can, I'm Honestly thinking of going keto again - only thing that really worked for me, when I tried it when I was ~22-23. I just wanted to get other things under control first, and I know it's not something my doctor would recommend. 

Sorry to ramble. I'm just not in a great place right now. I have to go to the beach for a few days with my partners family in a few - and we're passing by my old college town, where I have some relatives that want to meet, that haven't seen me since all this weight, and I think I'm just catastrophizing about it a little, and also wallowing in how not great I feel in my body. 

I love it. It's trying it's best. I just wish it was easier to be healthy and I miss clothes that feel like me and I miss feeling like I'm not creaking or stressing my joints out while doing laundry or making coffee in the morning. It's exhausting. I'm going to make some tea and hug my cat.

1kwllth,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1kwllth/the_river_wives/,The River Wives,"The hilltop cottage was somehow even smaller than it looked online, but that made it feel even more charming. Sunlight spilt generously through the mismatched windows, catching on the old brass fixtures and the worn but beautiful woodwork that ran along the door frames; while the garden was wild and overgrown in the best way, full of wild pollinator flowers for bees and tangled roses, with thyme creeping in through the cracks of the old stone path. It had its flaws but, the price had been unbelievably low for what it was, and Mara was over the moon.

""I love it!‚Äù she beamed, arms spread like she was already embracing it. ""And look at that view, it‚Äôs like a painting! There are so many pretty places to take pictures for my shop!""

She was right. Our view was stunning, fields folded over each other in soft, green swells, a thin river glinting with seams of silver. While the town itself sat low, a smudge of clustered rooftops nestled in the valley, ringed by more of those sleepy trees.

I had told Mara it was a romantic reset. I used words like digital detox and back to basics, which she ate up. But what she didn't know was I was buried in debt so deep I couldn't see daylight. Cards, loans, sharks that kept lending even when I had nothing left to prove I could pay them back. I had bet our house as a final hope to get it all back, and lost it. This cottage was a cheap scapegoat; I just didn't know how long we could keep it up.

\---

The general store sat squat and low, as if it had grown there. Inside, it smelled like old wood and something sharp like vinegar or pickled onions. Mara was already halfway down one of the narrow aisles, asking about local trails and making conversation the way she was always good at doing.

The man she was talking to was in his late fifties, maybe older, with a weathered face and hands that looked too big for the delicate register he tapped with one knuckle. When he finally looked up, he did it slowly and grumpily in a way that I assumed came with age. He looked at Mara, then me, and finally tilted his chin towards our new home.

""The River Wives don't like being seen,"" he said. His voice was calm, but it felt rehearsed. ""Especially not by young women.""

Mara paused, halfway through flipping a trail map over. ""The what?""

""The ones by the water.‚Äù He responded quickly. ‚ÄúYou'll know them if you see them. Don't let it get that far. And if you have to walk past the river, wear something that doesn't invite trouble. Cover up.‚Äù

Before we could ask what that meant, another man, a customer presumably, spoke from somewhere in the store.

""He‚Äôs right‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt greet them. Do your best to ignore them.‚Äù

Mara turned, frowning like she was trying to decide if this was a joke or some backwoods performance art. I watched as she folded the trail map with careful fingers, her mouth pressed into a polite, unreadable line. She didn't say anything, but the silence felt like it had teeth. She gave the man a short nod and stepped away, the trail map still clutched in her hand.

At the far end of the counter, a woman looked up from her station behind a battered produce scale. Late sixties, maybe, with a pinched expression that made it hard to tell if she was squinting at something. She looked at Mara.

""Girls dress like that in the city, I'm sure,"" she said, sizing Mara up. ""But the river's not the place to be softhearted."" She dropped a handful of apples into a paper bag and folded the top slowly, ""Some things out here take advantage when you go offering bits of yourself without thinking.""

Mara smiled politely, but I could see the muscle working in her jaw. She wasn't the type to speak up to strangers, so she gave a quick ‚ÄúOf course"" and turned to me. I caught her expression; the kind of look meant, 'Get me out of here before I say something I'll regret.'

""Let's go,"" I said, already moving. ""Still need to get to the hardware shop before it shuts. Thank you for the advice.""

We stepped out into the sun, and Mara was quiet for exactly three seconds.

""Bloody hell,"" she muttered. ""Cover up? Because my arms are out? It's twenty-one degrees, and I'm wearing a nice sundress. Sorry for dressing like it's a warm day and not a funeral."" She didn't wait for me to respond, just kept walking. ""I get that it's a small town,"" she said, ""but come on. 'Offering bits of yourself'? 'Wear something that doesn't invite trouble'?"" She made air quotes without slowing her pace. ""It's all just polite language for 'know your place, girl.' Did you notice they didn't say a word to you?""

""I did notice,"" I said. ""And yeah, it's daft."" I glanced back at the shop, then ahead at the worn cobbles, tufts of grass poking through the gaps, and nettles crowding the edge of the road. ""These people've known each other forever. They've grown up together and seen each other through weddings, funerals, and the lot. They've probably sat in the same pub with the same pint and the same complaints since the seventies."" I kicked at a loose stone. ""We're just new faces to them. It doesn't matter what we say or how reasonable we know we sound, it's still us stepping into their town. That doesn't make what they said right. Just means it's not about us.""

I gave her a nudge with my elbow. ""You know, you could always bring a few soaps round to the shop. You give them something nice, they might start being nice back.""

That got the corner of her mouth to twitch, just enough to call it a win.

\---

A few days in, I was still finding my rhythm, but Mara took to the countryside as if she'd always belonged in it; she was already in boots, basket looped over her arm, picking wild things from the hedgerow as she knew them by name. She dried bundles of herbs on twine stretched across the kitchen window. Yarrow, mugwort, lavender, horsetail. Always something gently fragrant tucked behind her ear. She sang when she worked, little hums and wordless melodies that carried through the house like incense and cheered me up as I worked remotely. Sometimes I'd find love notes folded and slipped under my coffee mug, tiny sketches of flowers or hearts, which felt great. Until I remembered the real reason we were here.

I started going for early runs; most mornings, I was out the door before Mara was up, lacing my shoes on the doorstep while the sky was still waking. It gave me space to properly think. But no matter how far I went, I always ended up circling back to the same thought: I needed to tell her. And the longer I left it, the worse it would be. I'd lost our old life to a stupid, selfish mistake. I hadn't just messed up; I'd properly wrecked things. This cottage, this so-called ""fresh start,"" was damage control.

And yet‚Ä¶ she liked it here. She was happy. And part of me kept wondering if I told her now, would she be furious enough to leave? Or would she stay because, despite everything, something good had come out of the mess?

I didn't know. I just knew I couldn't keep dodging it forever.

One of the first few mornings, I decided to try a different path. I was still working out which ones were worth the mud and which ones didn't leave you stuck two fields from where you meant to be. This one dipped through a patch of larch and followed the river for a bit. I hadn't been that way before. It was colder down there. Damp hung heavy in the air and caught in your throat, and in the mornings, there was a fog that thickened the closer you got to the river's path.

I spotted some figures in the fog. There were women, standing knee-deep in the river, backs turned, half-lost between the trees and the fog. They seemed to be barefoot, their dresses hung soaked and heavy, clinging to their legs. Headscarves knotted tight, not a strand of hair showing. They moved in silence, slowly and steadily scrubbing stained fabric against old wooden washboards. One of them lifted a strip of cloth wet and heavy; she twisted it with both hands, and red water trickled out.

Then my foot went out from under me. I went down hard, knee-first into the path. Pain shot up my leg sharp enough to make me swear out loud. My palms followed, scraping against the grit and shaving away at my skin. I stayed down for a second, catching my breath. When I looked, blood was already starting to soak through the fabric of my joggers.

When I limped back into the kitchen, Mara was already at the counter, hanging another row of drying bundles in the window while she made breakfast. She turned, took one look at my leg and then my top, and frowned.

""What the hell happened to you?""

""River path,"" I said. ""Slipped.""

She eyed the bloodied streaks down my trousers, the stubborn stain spreading beneath the fabric. She touched the hem gently, then looked at me for a long moment.

""Lucky you,"" she said. ""I made a new bar yesterday; it's good for blood, could pull that out nicely."" She moved to the shelf and peeled back the linen from a stack of pale grey soap bars, all the same size and shape. More than she usually made in one go. I frowned.



""You planning a bulk sale I don't know about?"" She didn't answer, too preoccupied with ensuring her food didn't burn. She passed it to me like she hadn't heard the question.

""Use cold water first,"" she said. ""Always cold. Heat sets it in. Then scrub it out with this. Work it into it. Let it sit a bit.""

She didn't offer to do it for me, which was strange for her. ""Was it path by the bend?"" she asked, almost offhandly, ""Where the fog rolls in?""

I nodded.

She didn't look up. ""That's where the best wild Yarrow grows. Loads of it just before the river curves back inland. Some of it's already gone to seed, but I've still been able to find the good stuff."" She stirred the pot on the stove, her wrist moving slowly and steadily. ""It's quiet out there,"" she said. ""I know what you're going to say. Yes - I saw the ‚ÄúRiver Wives‚Äù as they call them. Don't worry,"" She scoffed, ""I didn't bother them. But I still think it's mad that a town like this lets its oldest women stand out in the cold doing laundry like it's 1820. Bloody backwards if you ask me.""

There was a long pause as I recalled my encounter this morning.

""Yeah. You're right,"" I said. ""But it's not our place. Do you really need to go all the way out there for Yarrow? I can pick it up for you on my runs if you want?""

She turned, slowly.

""I like it here,"" she said. ""I love it, actually. But I'm not stupid. You've seen how they talk to me. Like I'm a child, or a housecat."" She set the spoon down, a bit harder than she probably meant to. ""I won't play small just because it makes this place more comfortable. I like my walks, I like finding things with my own two hands. I don't need someone fetching Yarrow for me like I'm some little wifey who's safer staying inside.""

""Alright, alright"", I said gently. ""I get it. I'm sorry...""

She sighed, pinching the bridge of her nose. ""Sorry. That wasn't aimed at you. Just‚Ä¶ all of it. This place is so beautiful until people start speaking that way.""

I stepped forward and rested a hand lightly on her back. She didn't pull away

""You're right,"" I said quietly. ""You shouldn't have to shrink. Not for anyone.""

She looked at me, and something softened behind her eyes. Her shoulders dropped a little 

""We moved here to grow, and instead, I'm supposed to fold up smaller.""

""You won't,"" I said. ""Not with me. Not ever."" She leaned into my chest with a small, exhausted sigh, and I wrapped my arms around her, careful of the herbs still tied at her hip.

""I like that you worry,"" she murmured. ""Just don't make me delicate. I'm not.""

""I know,"" I said. ""You're a bloody force.""



That got a quiet laugh. She pressed her forehead into my shoulder and let it sit there for a few seconds longer. Then she pulled away and gave my leg a glance. 

""You'd better get scrubbing, by the way. If you let that set, I'm not making a second batch.""

""Noted,"" I said. ""Cold water. Firm scrubbing. Let it sit. Got it.""

She gave me a mock-stern nod and went back to her pot.

\---

I waited a few days before running again. My knee still twinged when I bent it too far, but I told myself the ache was good; it meant it was healing. It was early again, and the fog thickened as I got closer just like last time. This time however, I was determined to see what was past the river. 

And as I‚Äôd expected, they were there again.

The same women in soaked dresses, dragging the soaking clothes against the washboards. But this time, one of them turned slightly like she'd heard me coming. Her face stayed hidden, turned just enough that the scarf blocked everything but the curve of her jaw. 

""Would you be kind,"" she spoke, ""and give this one a twist? These old hands aren't what they used to be.""

She held up a sodden sheet; it was dark and dripping. She turned it slightly in her hands. It hung limp and lifeless, the water sliding off in long, reluctant ropes. There was something in the way she asked‚Ä¶ though I couldn‚Äôt put my finger on it.

So I stopped.

The fog pressed against my back. The only sound was the slow drag of fabric and the slap of water on stone; the birdsong had long disappeared.

My fingers twitched like they might move on their own, and I shuffled my feet to move, but then I noticed her arms. They pale and bloated, way past the usual prune from water. Then I noticed the folds of the dress near her wrists were torn in places, like the fabric had been picked at. And the sheet‚Ä¶ it wasn't clean. The water sliding off it was thick and red, too heavy-looking to be just mud.

""Come on, love,"" she said again, voice softer this time. ""You've got young arms. I've had awful joint pain lately and a terrible bit of rheumatism in the elbows. It just needs a twist.""

She gave the sheet a small, hopeful jiggle like that would draw me closer. She still didn't look at me, which bothered me more than I wanted to admit. I don't know why, but it made my skin crawl. There's something unnatural about someone asking you for help without ever meeting your eyes.

""My wrists have been locking up something terrible,"" she added, as if it hurt just to say it. ""All this damp in the air... 'worse than it used to be. You'd be doing me a kindness.""



The other women didn't react; they continued dragging their fabrics against the washboards, like I wasn't even there.

The words from the general store came crawling back: eyes low, don't greet them, don't offer anything. I'd thought it was cruel the first time - rude for the sake of it. But at that moment, it felt like advice was passed on with caution. Still, I hesitated. Because what if she really was just some old woman in the cold water, soaked to the skin, wrists giving out from years of doing this exact motion? What if I was being the bad guy here, watching her struggle and walking away like it cost me something? 

""Ummm..."" I began

""Oh, sod it then,"" she snapped at my voice ""Suit yourself.""

The shift in tone shocked me. It wasn't the sort of hurt you'd expect from being turned down. It was snappy and impatient. Like she'd dropped something and blamed me for not catching it. ""Not even a moment for an old woman with bad arms,"" she hissed, more to the river than to me. ""What a thing, to watch someone struggle and turn your back on them. Must be nice, being young and quick. Men are so bloody selfish.""

I clenched my jaw. Heat flared across my face from embarrassment. A few days ago, Mara had practically bitten my head off for offering to help; now, some old hag in a river had made me feel like a villain for not pitching in.

I didn't know what the hell women wanted anymore.

I decided to stay silent and let the fog have the last word. I turned back to the path and let my feet do what they came here to do: move. My breathing evened out as I picked up my speed. The rest of the trail cut through thickets and a small patch of pine. The cold stuck to my skin, and the sound of the river grew faint behind me, and I let it fade. 

By the time I got home, the sun had risen properly. The mist was already pulling back like it hadn't touched anything.

But something had. I felt off, like the run had taken something out of me. My legs ached, my fingers felt stiff, and there was a throb in the back of my head that hadn't been there when I left. I skipped breakfast. Took a shower so hot it should've scalded. Still, it barely did anything. By late afternoon, I was curled up on the sofa under a blanket, useless.

Mara came in from the garden with dirt on her knees and a fresh bundle of herbs in one hand ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs me sorted for a few months,‚Äù she was slightly wet from getting caught in sudden rain. She glanced at me, taking in my pale face, then back at the kettle near the fire ""You're not running tomorrow.""

""I wasn't planning to,"" I said. My voice came out hoarse like I'd been shouting when I hadn't said much of anything.

""You look like a washed-out sock,"" she said, crouching to stoke the fire back to life. ""Bit of man flu?""

""Something like that.""

She didn't press and set the kettle above the fire more carefully than usual and sat beside me, still smelling like rosemary and wet grass. ""Maybe your body's trying to tell you something,"" she said quietly. ""That you keep pushing into places that don't want you.""

I didn't answer. Didn't know how to, really. She didn‚Äôt know it, but she was spot on. She passed me a cup of tea she hadn't asked if I wanted. Strong, slightly bitter. The kind she made whenever I was sick ""You resting tomorrow?"" she asked again, gently this time.

""Yeah,"" I said. ""I'm staying in. We can have a lie-in together.""

She smiled, but kept her distance. ""Absolutely not,"" she said ""I make soaps, not cures. The last thing I need is catching whatever this is and sneezing over my stock.""

I gave a weak laugh, half into the tea. ""Wow. No bedside manner.""

She grinned. ""Not in the job description. You want sympathy, you'll have to bribe me with biscuits. Then you'll get some tea and toast in bed if you're lucky.""

\---

The next morning, the sun woke me before I was ready. It poured through the thin curtains in strips, warm across my face. Nice, actually. One of those rare moments where the light feels soft instead of sharp. I still felt awful, and it became clear that I sweated through the night, despite the fact that the sun's warmth and quiet made me feel like I could've maybe stayed like that for a while.

I reached over, expecting to feel the softness of Mara's skin, but the bed was empty. The covers on Mara's side were flat and cold. I blinked up at the ceiling, confused for a second. I had been looking forward to tea and toast in bed, like she usually did when I had the man flu. I listened for her. The house had thin walls - you could hear everything in it. But there was nothing. Just quiet.

I sat up, slowly. My head swam with that awful, cotton-wool-in-your-skull kind of dizzy. Everything felt a bit too bright, a bit too sharp. My legs were heavy with fatigue, but I swung out of bed anyway, feet hitting the cold tile of the floor.

I made my way around the house, noticing nothing unusual until I saw that her boots were missing.

She wouldn't have gone far. Or at least, that's what I told myself at first. But something didn't sit right. Mara had already gathered all the herbs she needed- she'd said so. Everything was drying nicely on the twine above the sink, and the rest of her supplies were tucked away in their usual spots.

I looked up at the shelf where she kept her finished soaps. The top row was still lined with her usuals: lavender, oat, rosemary - but the pale grey bars she had me use the other day were gone. I moved closer, squinting. Maybe they'd been moved to the market box? My brain felt fogged over, like thinking through cling film. I touched the shelf to steady myself.

Nothing. Not a single bar left.



I opened the bin on instinct. Half-buried under yesterday's peelings was the linen wrap she used for packaging. The same dotted one she'd used when she first showed me the batch had been folded once, then crumpled. Like someone had changed their mind at the last second.

I knew where she'd gone. Even before I admitted it, I knew.

I turned and grabbed the nearest pair of shoes. My head spinning as I bent down, but I shoved them on anyway.

The air outside was sharp but warm from the rising sun. That same low mist was back again, thicker near the fields, sticking to my throat with every breath. My legs protested the second I pushed into a run. Cold muscles, leftover fever, I felt wrong. But still, I ran.

The trail was soft from last night's rain. I kept slipping, catching myself just before I went fully down. My breathing turned quick and ragged too soon. I followed the curve of the path, past the hedgerow, past the spot I fell before. And then I saw her bootprints in the mud, leading down to the water's edge.

I picked up speed.

And there she was.

Mara stood at the bank, boots muddy, sleeves pushed up. She had both hands out in front of her, offering the soap to the River Wives.

The woman closest to her lifted her head, and I saw her. Her face was puffed out in places and sunken in others like it had been soaking too long in the wrong kind of water. A bloated corpse came to mind. Her skin had that grey puffy look like you'd see in pictures you wish you hadn't clicked on. Her lips were thin but puffed at the edges, like they were losing their shape.

I opened my mouth to call out, but instead, my stomach turned. The run, the fever and the sight of the woman all hit me at once. The taste of last night's food climbed up the back of my throat, and I barely had time to lurch to the side before it came up. I doubled over, retching hard, hands braced on my knees. Bitter, half-digested vomit hit the mud with a wet slap. My eyes watered. The noise, the stench, and the sting in my nose all grounded me and made it worse. I wiped my mouth with the back of my dressing-gown sleeve, heart still hammering, chest heaving. And Mara had turned towards me with a concerned look on her face.

She didn't have time to say anything.

The River Wives moved faster than they had any right to. One of them surged from the water in a wet heave, cloth slapping against stone. Mara turned back too late. Her hands fumbled, soap slipping from her palms and hitting the rocks.

Another one rose beside her, then another... And another. They surrounded her, Waterlogged limbs coiling around her legs, waist, and arms. One pressed a palm flat against her chest. Her boots lost grip, and her knees gave. They began to drag their washboards across her back, over her arms, over her scalp like they were trying to strip her clean. They worked fast, her clothes came apart at the seams. Threads pulled like worms from the stitching, her skin went with it, peeled back in patches, red blooming and then vanishing under the froth. One of them worked at her wrist until the joint gave a little pop, then twisted.

Another opened their mouth wide and bit down on Mara's shoulder like it was bread. The flesh gave.

Mara's mouth opened, but no sound came. 

I forced myself upright. Stumbling forward, my legs didn't want to cooperate. Mara reached out in a last, weak attempt to push away, to reach for me, but then her head went under. Her hair was the last thing I saw of her, fanned out on the surface like ink in water.

I finally made myself step forward, and one foot sank into the bank, but I didn't go any further. I couldn't. I was outnumbered.

There were too many of them. And whatever they were, they weren't just old bats with bad joints. I threw up again, barely staying upright. Still shaking. I could taste it all in my mouth and feel last night's sweat still clinging to my neck.

One of them turned slightly in my direction, just enough to let me know she'd clocked me, and I stumbled back weakly. Shoes skidding in the mud. My heel caught a root, and I went down hard, hands scraping against cold muddied stone as I scurried back on my feet, losing a shoe to the river, and I ran faster than I had ever run before.

I didn't stop until I hit the edge of the village. My lungs were burning. My chest felt too small. One foot was raw, my sock soaked through, and mud clung to the back of my legs like tar.

I stumbled into the centre, wheezing, hunched, eyes scanning for anyone. The first person I saw was the woman from the shop. She didn't flinch. 

""You're a state,"" she said instead, eyes flicking to my missing shoe, then the blood and dirt down my arm. ""You went down there, didn't you?""

I opened my mouth to speak, but the words weren't ready. My throat closed around them. Behind her, another man leaned out from the post office steps. He took one look at me, then shook his head like he'd seen all he needed.

""You were warned, son. Better not bring that hassle into town; either leave or go back and finish what you started.""

I shook my head, still breathless, voice barely there. ""I need the police. I need someone to-""

The woman scoffed. Actually scoffed. ""Oh, love, no one's calling anyone. What would they even do? Fill out a form and lose it?""

I looked up at her. Mud streaked up my legs, acid in my throat, one shoe gone to the river. I must've looked half-mad.

""She's gone,"" I said. It came out dry, and it stung. ""They took her.""

The woman from the shop just shook her head. ""Then it's done.""



She looked me over again, but there was no pity in it. ""They're not coming for you,"" she said. ""Whatever happened out there, it was between her and them. They don't take much interest in men."" She nodded at my state, like that explained it all. ""You're not theirs to bother. Not unless you give them a reason."" She paused momentarily as if deciding whether to waste her time saying the rest. Then she nodded toward the village green. ""You can waste your morning reporting it. The police'll go down there, poke around with their notebooks, and by the time they do, they won't find a thing. They never do."" She shifted her weight and tucked her hands into her cardigan sleeves. ""Or‚Ä¶ you can come inside, sit down, and have a cup of tea. Let it settle a bit. Figure out what you want to do next. If anything.""

I couldn‚Äôt answer.  The clouds had closed in, and rain had started again, that fine, soaking kind. She gave me a look that wasn't quite sympathy. Just something lik,e ""Well? Pick.""

\---

The weeks that followed were slow and quiet in the worst kind of way. The shop lady was right, the police didn‚Äôt find anything. They looked at me like they knew what was happening, like an adult checking under a child‚Äôs bed for monsters. They asked me to walk them through it, so I did; the whole thing sounded like a story, one of them nodded like he was listening, but I could tell he wasn‚Äôt hearing a word and just filling in boxes in his head. 

They stepped down to the river eventually, boots careful on the edge, like they didn‚Äôt want to get dirty. One of them crouched and stared at the water for a while like it might offer something up if he looked long enough. The other paced around with a stick, prodding at the reeds like he would find her folded neatly in the mud, just waiting to be uncovered. They didn‚Äôt find anything, they knew they wouldn‚Äôt, I could see it in the way they moved. Slow, and half-hearted. In the end, they gave me a number to call and said someone might be in touch if anything came up, though it probably wouldn‚Äôt.

I didn't leave the town, I couldn't. Every room still had her in it despite our short time there. Her handwriting on labels, her coat on the back of the door. That stupid mug with the chip in the handle she always said gave it 'character.'

Some mornings I'd wake up forgetting. Turn to her side of the bed, expecting her weight and warmth. Only to be met with a flat sheet and silence.

And that's all it took.

The silence would drag me back to that day, straight to the mud, her final moments when she reached out. My chest would lock up like someone had stuck their hand inside and squeezed tight, and my hands would shake. Breathing would come wrong, sharp and fast, like I was choking. Sometimes, I'd curl up and try to ride it out. Other times, I'd sit up and press my palms to my knees like that might pin me to the moment and anchor me down until the wave passed. It always passed. But it took its time.

Some days, I thought maybe I should burn the whole house down with myself in it.

But I didn't.

The people in town started treating me differently. With nods and cups of tea, the townspeople stopped to ask how I was holding up. They didn't say 'sorry' - not outright - but it was there in the way they helped me. The shop woman, Hilda, even started saving me the good milk without asking. One of the older men gave me his spare radio ""in case the silence ever gets too loud."" 

""You're one of us now,"" Hilda said, handing me a paper bag of apples without charging. ""Everyone loses someone. Eventually. In one way or another.""

So I stayed. Partly because I had nowhere else to go and partly because of my debt. Even if I could, the thought of packing up and moving on somewhere else without her made me feel sick.

I kept Mara's little shop going under her name. Changed the labels on her soaps to 'Mara's Blend' and started selling them at the market. They did well. I messed up a few batches, some trial and errors - but before I knew it, they started to smell like her. It was maybe a month later when I realized I was out of Yarrow. I'd used the last of it on the latest batch, it didn‚Äôt feel right to stop making one of our best sellers.

I thought about asking someone to fetch some for me. But that felt like cheating.

So I waited.

A few days turned into a week. I kept putting it off, and even tried looking for it in different areas. At one point. I told myself the blend didn't need Yarrow, but I knew I was wrong every time I ran my thumb over the label. Mara would have been furious at me for half-arsing something under her name.

The thought stuck and grew teeth. I kept seeing her hands, the way she held the bars when they were still curing, her thumb running along the edge. She‚Äôd never half-finish anything. Not even a breakfast. And there I was, letting fear decide what got made and what didn‚Äôt. Letting it whisper that maybe it wasn‚Äôt worth finishing, maybe it was safer not to.

Mara would have seen through that in two seconds. She‚Äôd have thrown something at me, probably a damp tea towel, and she‚Äôd have followed it up with that sharp little look she had. The one that said, Pull yourself together‚Ä¶ And she‚Äôd have been right.

All it did was give the anger space to grow; it started low in my chest and curled around the edges of everything as it festered into the corners of the cottage, and onto her side of the bed. Eventually, it boiled up into an idea, one I couldn‚Äôt shake away no matter what I tried.

‚Äî

That evening, the local pub was lively and dimly lit. A few of the regulars scattered across the low tables, shouting across to each other, cracking jokes. The fire was more glow than flame by now, mostly embers tucked into the grate, flickering just enough to keep the cold off the walls.

George, the gent who gave me the radio was sat near the back, half-watching darts on the telly. I took the stool next to him, no fuss, and didn‚Äôt bother with a pint.

‚ÄúYou still got that shotgun?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúBloody hell,‚Äù he said after a pause. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt start with hello anymore?‚Äù

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt feel like chatting.‚Äù

‚ÄúClearly.‚Äù He glanced at me suspiciously, like he already knew why I was there ‚ÄúWhat for?‚Äù

‚ÄúFoxes,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúBeen getting into the garden. They‚Äôve dug up half the beds, most of Mara‚Äôs corner. Chewed through all her hard work.‚Äù

That made him pause and set his pint down onto the sticky table somberly.

‚ÄúBloody hell,‚Äù he muttered. ‚ÄúThat patch always looked proper, never thought foxes‚Äôd go after herbs.‚Äù He went quiet at that, brows drawing in just a touch, the lines around his eyes settling deeper as if he were figuring out whether that was the truth or not.

‚ÄúBeen hearing that from other folks too,‚Äù he said after a beat. ‚ÄúNot just foxes. Badgers and rabbits too. All of ‚Äòem turning up where they shouldn‚Äôt be. They‚Äôre bold, like they forgot how to be wild. Don‚Äôt bolt anymore, just stand and watch you like they‚Äôre taunting you.‚Äù

I nodded once. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what they‚Äôve been doing.‚Äù

He studied me again.

‚ÄúYou planning to shoot anything?‚Äù

‚ÄúOnly if I have to.‚Äù

He let that sit between us for a second. Then gave a small nod ‚ÄúI‚Äôll get it to you in the morning,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOne day only. Barrel pulls a bit left if you‚Äôre not paying attention, and it kicks like it‚Äôs got something to prove, so don‚Äôt try and be clever.‚Äù

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt.‚Äù

‚Äî

Once I had the gun, I set out early. The sky was grey, and he path was soft with last night's rain. The shotgun was wrapped in oilcloth and strapped across my back, I could feel it with every step. Foxes, I‚Äôd said. Pests. George must have known; he had handed me the gun like he understood. He said nothing but gave me a little nod. The kind that said, ‚ÄòDo what you‚Äôve got to do, mate, but don‚Äôt come crying after.‚Äô

The fog was thicker this time, proper thick. It clung to the hedges and swirled low across the path. The visibility was awful, the river wasn‚Äôt even in sight yet, but I could feel it, just around the bend. That damp, cold presence and impending doom. I stopped walking, reached back, and undid the strap, it came free without fuss, oilcloth damp with mist. I unwrapped it slowly, feeling the weight of it in my hands. It felt wrong - like it knew I had no business holding it. My arms weren‚Äôt made for this, my hands weren‚Äôt steady. I‚Äôd never handled one before, not properly, not like this. And there I was, alone in the mud with fog at my ankles and a loaded shotgun in my grip like I knew what the hell I was doing.

I broke it open to check on the two shells; they were right where they were meant to be, and when I clicked it shut it made a proper sound, clean and final. Then, I kept moving slowly, my boots sank a little into the wet ground with each step. I could feel the thud of my heartbeat in my jaw, and fingertips.

Then I saw it.

A figure of a woman standing in the water with her back turned. Her dress soaked and clinging to her legs, and her head was wrapped in a scarf pulled tight. Every muscle in me went taut.

I raised the gun and flicked the safety off with my thumb, clumsy and stiff. The click was louder than I expected, it made hairs on the back of my neck stand up. The figure reacted to the noise, one foot dragging through the water like she was remembering how to stand. Her body swayed slightly, and every part of me tensed. My arms were locked, and my shoulders tightened. I braced the stock against my shoulder properly, lifted the barrel, and lined it up through the grey.

The fog swirled around her, thick as milk, only showing a blur of her. I couldn‚Äôt see her face, but I knew what this was, what it had to be.

One of them.

I had seen this before. I knew this shape, this silence. The soaked dress clinging to her legs, sleeves hanging heavy, hair hidden, no part of her left to recognise. She was just another one of them, waiting for her next victim.

So I aimed. 

And just when I had her square in my sights, she spoke.

""Did you finally bring those biscuits you promised me?"" 

The words took the ground out from under me without warning, and my arms dropped just a little and shook, I couldn‚Äôt help it. It felt as if the gun had become heavier. 

Because it was her‚Ä¶

Mara.

My dad was in business for over 30 years with his office supply and coffee company, but sold a couple years ago due to the pandemic.

Growing up I've always admired him for it, because in the eyes of a child it was the coolest thing in the world.

When I expressed my interest in learning about business and wanting to start my own after I graduated highschool, he was very reprehensive about teaching me.

I worked as a industrial electrical apprentice before I was layed off 2 weeks ago due to the US terriffs on Canada, this yurn to be my own boss,  to build something for myself, and to make my dad proud has strengthened a lot.

He said that he doesn't want me to live with that amount of stress and risk in my life yhat he did and that he wants me to learn a profession, invest smartly, and retire early.

While that isn't a bad life plan at all, and is wonderful advice, I have this feeling deep down that I was made for something greater, and that I can do amazing things with this life.

But the problem I'm running into, is I have no clue on where to start or what to do.

The other part of the issue is paralysis by analyzation, there's so many different business and services that I could offer and provide, but I can't choose where to start because there are so many different avenues to pursue as well as positives and negatives with every option.

All I'm asking for is some guidance.
Courses I could take, YouTube channels that are helpful on the topic, books that I should keep on my reading rotation.

I have all the free time in the world, a car, around 7k CAD in savings and a bunch of collectibles I could part with that would be worth around the same.

Anything will help, I appreciate you all.

Like the title says, I'm falling out of love with my husband and it's happening pretty quickly, to the point I'm almost disgusted to even be near him. We have one child together, and I have one from a previous marriage. My husband and I have a lot of the same ideals and goals, what we want from life, and the same principles of raising kids. We both like traveling and learning about new topics; we have many things in common. it seems like it should be great. But he is mean, vindictive, and manipulative. When he gets mad he constantly threatens to divorce me, or he will say things like, ""Well, if you don't do that, then you don't really love me,"" or ""if you don't do that, get a divorce attorney"" but it's always mundane things. He uses that when he wants to get his way, not when there is a real ""issue"" within the marriage. When he is mad at me, he also treats my oldest child differently. Like he won't talk to him, or if he does, it's very short with him, and my son notices too; he's old enough to see he's being treated differently. My husband has a horrible anger problem any time something doesn't go his way, so we are all constantly on eggshells‚Äîwhat will trigger him today? Aside from things like that, he does nothing around the house. Or the yard. He's very lazy. He grew up in a household where his mom did everything and his dad went to work. His dad refuses to even make himself coffee. If his mom isn't home, his dad won't eat until she gets home and cooks. It's really bad. They are from a different country too, so I should mention that behavior is very normal in their home country. But they have been in the States for 25 years now; my husband doesn't even remember a lot about his home country because he's been here so long. But, initially I summed his lack of home involvement up to his culture, but he's been here nearly his entire life, and he has even said he hates the way his dad treats his mom, and he never wants to be that way. But he gets off from work, showers, and sits on his phone. He doesn't cook and refuses to learn how to cook even one or two easy meals for when I'm not home. He will constantly mention things that need to be done, but he won't do them. He is very much a ""leave me a list"" guy, but anyone with kids KNOWS you can usually SEE what needs to be done. And if I do leave him a list, he gets mad because ""I'm an adult; I don't need you to tell me what to do."" He is not handy. He breaks more things than he fixes, then complains about hiring people to fix things he broke. I mow the yard. I take care of the kids by myself. I provide all care for the animals. Also, I am in school and work full time. 

My husband has stated in the past he knows he needs mental health care and has started medication multiple times, but the side effects have been awful, so he stops. I've talked to him about counseling multiple times, and he absolutely will not do it. I've offered to go too, so we can do marriage counseling and learn together, and he still won't. Since he refuses that I've tried to do stuff at home with him, read certain books and do couples activities, he won't do those either. When he is in a good mood and approachable, we have talked about these things many times, and I will sometimes see tiny baby steps, but one inconvenience and it's back to start. Since he has brought up he knows he needs help, does at least try different medications I feel a sliver of hope; that's better than nothing, but the constant back and forth, lashing out and everything combined is just so unattractive. I feel like we shouldn't have gotten married because now I'm a single married mother who is also raising her husband and trying to push him to get mental health care. It's too much. I'm overwhelmed. 

I've tried talking to a close friend and two family members about things who I trust, and they all think I'm just being dramatic or an upset wife. Or worse, one even thought I was being funny (I do joke a lot and am usually lighthearted and silly), but they actually thought I was being ha ha funny. I've talked to his sister who I am close to and who tried before we got married to get him into counseling and get him help, and now I get kind of a ""he's your problem now"" attitude‚Äîbut I do think his family is tired of it; they've dealt with it much longer than I have. 

I feel very stuck and hopeless and like a failure. Two failed marriages and two kids. I'm tired. I don't even know what I'm seeking on here, maybe to be heard. I don't know. ",1,1748347000.0,Marriage,2,1.0,False

We also want to try new restaurants.

Last time we went to:
	‚Ä¢	Mooch
Great view especially during sunset. We ordered New York pizza, seafood pasta, and carrot cake. The food was just okay. I‚Äôd rate it 5 out of 10. It‚Äôs also far so if you don‚Äôt have a car, I don‚Äôt recommend visiting late afternoon or at night. It can be hard to get a ride back
	‚Ä¢	Victoria‚Äôs Bakeshop
I bought the cream puff. I think it tasted better before so 6.5 out of 10. But the tuna ciabatta was surprisingly good. They were generous with the tuna spread and the lettuce was fresh. I‚Äôd rate that 9 out of 10. It would be even better with chips on the side
	‚Ä¢	Luisa‚Äôs
We decided to order mami for breakfast but got disappointed. We had chicken mami and beef wonton mami with veggies. You could tell the ingredients were not fresh especially the meat. I‚Äôd rate it 2 out of 10. I think their rice meals might be the better option
	‚Ä¢	Nonno Guido‚Äôs
It was far but worth the trip. We ordered beef salpicao and salmon. Food was delicious and the place was quiet. 9 out of 10. I just wish the presentation was nicer. Bigger plates, better glasses, and maybe tablecloths with a checkered print would make it perfect for dates. But same as Mooch, if you don‚Äôt have a car, I don‚Äôt recommend going in the evening. It‚Äôs hard to get a ride back
	‚Ä¢	Good Taste
Still sulit for the taste and generous servings. We ordered grilled spare ribs and chopsuey with lechon. 8 out of 10. It really looks like a huge canteen but overall still a good pick. Bonus: there was no long wait time when we were there
	‚Ä¢	Foam
Aesthetic place. I liked the sakura hibiscus and the burnt basque cheesecake donut. 8 out of 10
	‚Ä¢	Hatch Coffee
I liked the burger but surprisingly enjoyed the grilled cheese even more. Also loved the place itself. 8.5 out of 10. Hoping they‚Äôll offer a version that‚Äôs not smashed

Genuinely considering leaving my partner because he doesn't help with the chores,"I (32F) have been with my partner (33M) for 13 years, and I primarily ask two things from him:

1. to please pick up after himself before work, namely not leaving food and drink out, and to not leave wet towels or dirty clothes on the furniture.

2. To unplug the electricals that are safety hazards before bed, as I usually go to bed first.



I ask him to do these things for me because of the following: 

‚Ä¢ Every morning I come down and there's his leftover breakfast food and drink on the coffee table, sometimes food and drink from the previous night, too. The problem is, more than once my pets - cats and a dog - have gotten into whatever has been left out, and I'm usually left dealing with the side effects of that. Two weeks ago, I have surgery to remove a tumour from my side. The next day, he left a glass out and some doughnuts and I only realised because I heard a smashing sound as I was trying to rest up in bed. One of the cats had tried eating the doughnuts and knocked the glass over by accident, and I had to sit on my hands and knees less than 24 hours post surgery picking glass shards out of the rug, checking the animals for injuries, and cleaning up the stain from the spilt drink. All I got was a surly ""yeah, sorry, whatever"" when he came home from work. 


‚Ä¢ At least twice a week I have to rewash a batch of my clean laundry because he will dump sweaty clothes on it or dump a wet smelly towel on it, and ruin them. 


 ‚Ä¢ More than once he's left electrical running and accidentally covered them with soft furnishings and they've started to get dangerously hot. Once even smoking and damaging the plug. 


I am disabled so I work from home. I also take online classes as a hobby as it's really the only thing I have that is for me, look after myself and manage my medications, look after my pets (something I do alone whether or not he is home), and do chores. I also have remote therapy sessions twice a week. I spend most of my time in my home office because it is upstairs next to the bedroom and bathroom, in case something happens to me medically. Because of my disability, I have a lot less energy and I usually go to bed a couple of hours earlier than my partner as a result, as I'm exhausted by 10pm.


I don't really ask him for anything else because I used to ask him for help with chores I physically cannot do by myself due to my disability, and if I asked again (I usually waited anywhere between two weeks and six months later if it still hadn't been done, as to not bother him too soon) he'd call me a mithering cow, or nagging bitch and that was really starting to negatively impact my self esteem.



I've tried to explain to him multiple times that these are relatively small tasks that might take him less than a minute at most to complete, but if they're left out they can go on to cause bigger problems that are harder to deal with. Also, because of my disability I have less energy and even small tasks take me much longer to physically complete, not to mention the pain they can cause, so it's not really fair. It also eats into my work day, and it's not really fair of him to expect him to do his chores when I should be doing my job. More than once I've had to give up my classes to fix messes he's made, which legitimately makes me really sad.


The thing is, these things still happen. Not just sometimes, either, but every day. Most nights I have to get back out of bed after he comes up to turn things off, and usually when he hasn't he's left them in some sort of potentially hazardous position again. Every day I sacrifice my early lunch break cleaning up his mess to prevent one of the animals getting sick or hurt. I rewash clean loads of laundry at least twice a week because he's dumped his sweaty clothes on top of the pile before getting in the shower, or he leaves wet towels on clean clothes and furniture which makes them smell really bad. It's so tiring. 

I've tried talking to him about it multiple times, and the responses usually range from ignoring me, saying ""okay, fine, I won't do it again"" (then doing it again anyway), getting angry at me, or telling me I'm at home all day and I don't have a real job (I do), so I can just do it. Sometimes I've been so exhausted and spread thin, especially when he comes home and plays video games for hours whilst I'm so tired and in so much pain from juggling multiple things all day, I either get frustrated and it turns into an argument, or I cry. Both options usually end with him calling me pathetic, or telling me that I'm fucked up for blowing things so out of proportion. He doesn't seem to understand that I'm upset and mad because this is something he's been asked to help me with *thousands* of times over the years, and he still won't help me, and because he's eating into my time and energy, of which I have very little. I've also pointed out that when things get broken or need to be cleaned, that quick task of his turns into a bigger task for me, and that's not fair.


It's got to the point I'd genuinely consider leaving him if not for the fact that when I became suddenly disabled several years ago, his family (who run a successful business and are more knowledgeable about these things than I am) suggested we put everything in his name to help with things like mortgage applications and other loans, as we would probably be turned down if my name was on there too given my reduced income and disability status. I regret it now, as during arguments he has said everything is his and will stay his. I've told him how it is affecting me, and how it's making me not want to be with him any more because if I did manage to secure my own place, I'd actually have *less* to deal with as I wouldn't be cleaning up after him anymore. He laughed, called me pathetic, and said I was being too sensitive. 



I did try talking to my parents about it, but they're old fashioned Catholics and still hold the belief that the wife should be looking after the husband anyway. And they correctly point out that most men his age wouldn't want to deal with someone who is disabled, so I should cut him some slack. 



I feel like I'm going crazy, and I need to know if I'm being way too sensitive or if my feelings are justified.

   From a quick overview it looks like it's in a good condition, it looks brand new except for the drum which as I say has had some use before. 
   The question I have really and it's hoping that people can help me. Are there any roast profiles I can try that people have successfully used as I've read that the auto profiles, while good, don't engage the fan during the pre-heat. Are there also any preffered batch sizes that people have used and work well? I don't want to use it until I've got a bit of knowledge behind it. 
   I have worked in a roastery  before so I have some roasting knowledge, just want to maintain the machine as much as I can to get the most out of it. 
  Any help would be wonderful, and if anyone has any links to the discord, would be great as well :).
   
I'll most likely be roasting a few batches back to back as I roast for espresso and filter, though it is only me that drinks coffee so it will be once a week that I roast. I have a stock of green beans from my previous roaster (Gene cafe). I've got a varied selection as well so if anyone has a couple of profiles that would be wonderful :).

I usually use Orea Wave filters (same price as Kalita 185s where I live, but with a faster TBT).

Setup

* ZeroWater with Lotus Bright/Juicy recipe (this batch was 82ppm).
* Zerno Z1 with 64mm SSP MP blind burrs.
* The coffee is a Natural Catimor from Banka province in Yunnan (China), roasted by Coffee Pirates in Wien. (Original roaster link is 404, [Internet Archive link](https://web.archive.org/web/20250423151743/http://coffeepirates.at/products/china-banka)).
* 40s bloom, 60ml - 1st pour +60ml, 2nd pour at 1:20s +50ml, 3rd pour at 2:00s +100ml. TBT between 2:30s and 3m.

Specifically for this coffee I used the Melodrip through the Melodrip Lift.

* The shot at 11:52 is the one using Sibarist FAST
* The shot at 09:43 is the one using the Orea TYPE C

For reference, [here also a Visualizer](https://visualizer.coffee/shots/81e70fc2-f31e-4466-a43b-8b1688ff9d39) for the same coffee/recipe with an Orea Wave filter at a slightly lower temp (93¬∞C vs 95¬∞C for these tests).

On the important bits, the sensorial side

* Orea TYPE C iflter: Muted. Barely perceived caramel and chocolate. Tasted somewhat over-extracted (probably my fault, TBT of 3:05 given the near lack of agitation is quite something, should've grind coarser to about 525-530 microns). Not a bad cup, but nothing popped.
* Sibarist FAST: A different league. Clear grapefruit aroma. Pleasant acidity with distinct apricot and milk chocolate notes.

Just wanted to share my very first experience. In years of brewing, I've only picked out notes this distinctively when cupping - never this clearly with a filter before.",1,1748346325.0,pourover,2,0.67,False

I always explain this abstract concept or idea to my curious friends in Europe, why Islam can match with living culture in Indonesia perfectly. One of the reason is, there is a harmony correlation between the length of day and night in Indonesia with Islamic praying time. All of praying time for Muslims in a day falls in the best fit biological-activity time for Indonesians. When we start our day, we pray Subh. When we make lunch break, we pray Dzuhr. When we make coffee break, we pray Ashr. When we finish our work and come back home, we pray Maghrib and Isya. Not only that, our Ramadan fasting time is conveniently last for about 12 to 14 hours. There is strong coincidence that praying time for Muslims which follow the relative position of the sun duirng the day, can fit well with the daily activities of Indonesian people whose country lies exactly on equator. I always say to my foreign friends that this matching coincidence is somehow promoting the harmony between Islamic value and Indonesian culture.

But, do you as Muslims in Indonesia ever think that in many other regions on earth, this is not always the case? The length of day and night can deviate significantly, even there are some regions which have the length of day or night for 3 months straight. Do you think that Islamic value fails to hold coherently on the entire surface of earth? So, it is not universal for all human being on earth.",0,1748345515.0,indonesia,12,0.5,False

If you need a backstory: 

Business owner here‚Äîown a cafe that we just reopened and currently trying to figure out how to make the economics of it make sense in the honestly¬†tough¬†economic landscape. We closed it down late last year so we don‚Äôt burn out all the cash reserves we have. After a few months of reevaluating the business strategy, we reopened the business with limited hours to reduce the bleeding having no income but still paying rent and utilities.

At first, we felt really positive and motivated after finally getting a much-needed break from running the business non-stop for the past 4 years. We reopened, we were welcomed back and received a lot of love from our established customers.

But then¬†situations¬†like this really put such a huge downer on everything.¬†Things¬†are just downright depressing. Every single day we are open, I‚Äôm having to justify to people why I don‚Äôt allow laptops in our store. EVERY SINGLE DAY. It‚Äôs so¬†incredibly¬†tiring. We‚Äôve had a no-laptop policy for the 4 years, yet this is still an argument we have to have every day we are open. Why can‚Äôt I, a business owner, dictate the terms of what is and what is allowed inside my business premises? I don‚Äôt get it? Why do I have to justify it?

When we reopened, we expected business to be slow‚Äîso we had the mindset of trying not to alienate people too much. When someone came to the cafe, ordered a $4 Americano and took out their laptop‚ÄîI justified it by ""oh well, it‚Äôs just 1 person‚Ä¶ I think I‚Äôll just let it go."" Except I was quickly reminded why I shouldn‚Äôt do that. I was reminded of why, in the years we were running the cafe, we decided to have zero tolerance on laptops. We let one person do it, suddenly a group of students come in and see that we‚Äôre ok with it‚Äîso they take out their laptops too. Now, because we didn‚Äôt stop one person and they already bought something‚Äîit becomes hard to stop another group from doing it. Soon enough, within the span of a few hours‚Äîthe cafe is half filled with laptops and people who only ordered the cheapest item on the menu.

OK FINE‚ÄîI let it go for that day. 

By the next day I had signage beside our menu stating we have a no-laptop policy. I print the same signage and stick it to our front door. I start profiling people based on what they order and what bags they have on them (it‚Äôs very easy to tell once you start observing). If I conclude that there‚Äôs a high likeliness they‚Äôre here to get some work¬†done with their laptop, I let them know that we have a no-laptop policy before they order and pay. If I get it wrong and managed to let some people slip by, I approach them before they can fully setup, let them know of our policy, and offer them a full refund. From my side, I‚Äôm doing everything I can to reasonably let people know of our policy. I even go out of my way to recommend our nearby competitors who welcome laptops in their premises.

But we still get frustrating reviews like this:

https://preview.redd.it/g84pdhmv1b3f1.png?width=693&format=png&auto=webp&s=c7ccbf4525a0660e63ef04e94f380ac8013dfd8b

This is from a couple that were told about the no-laptop policy before they¬†could¬†order, then demanded to know why we have such a policy. After explaining to them, they proceeded to not order anything, go take up a table out of my line of sight, then setup their laptops hoping I won't do anything about it. Before they can fully setup, I approach their table and let them know that we are firm on our no-laptop policy, which finally gets them to¬†give up¬†and leave. Of course they need to have a final say and leave a bad review.

So now‚ÄîI have to be a¬†broken record. I have to tell¬†every single¬†customer that we don‚Äôt allow laptops at our store. It‚Äôs ridiculous. Signage beside the menu isn‚Äôt good enough. Signage beside the payment terminal isn‚Äôt good enough. Signage posted outside the door isn‚Äôt good enough. What next? Signage inside the washroom? Signage in every¬†single¬†wall? Bigger signage? Change the cafe name to ""NO LAPTOP CAFE""??¬†What on earth¬†is enough? BECAUSE SIMPLY HAVING CLEAR SIGNAGE OUTSIDE THE STORE EARNS ME A¬†STUPID 1-STAR REVIEW.

And I can't even reply because there is absolutely no point in replying. I get the satisfaction of telling someone off, but then things will just escalate. It's not easy to convince or extract empathy from people who are already taking an unreasonable stance. There's no winning- so what's the point?  
  
We didn‚Äôt make a lot of financial sacrifices, invest a lot of time, and took a risk to start a business because our dream was to start a¬†makeshift¬†co-working space / library with a glorified concession stand. I didn‚Äôt spend a¬†significant amount of¬†my time renovating the space to look nice so people can have a nice background for their¬†virtual¬†meetings.

Economy isn‚Äôt great so business isn't doing well. After pulling 3 consecutive 14-hour shifts, waking up to¬† another 1 star review makes me feel like we should just give up and shut down the¬†store for good.",16,1748345453.0,vancouver,49,0.61,False

Hey everyone! 

I recently made the switch from pre-ground coffee to whole beans after getting a Timemore C2 grinder. I picked up the Tulum trial pack of 5 different beans.

With pre-ground i never really got any noticeable trace of aroma from the coffee grounds, and was suggested to freshly grind the beans.
Got a Timemore c2 and whole beans,
While the beans do have a noticeable aroma both before and after grinding, (little to no aroma when brewing/when poured in the cup: i use a Frenchpress) there‚Äôs something funky about it, not necessarily pleasant. It‚Äôs hard to describe, but the smell is different, and it almost seems off.

I did not find any of the trial pack‚Äôs smell fragment or pleasant.

I remember i only once could get aroma from a pre ground pack of BT. And it smelled great. So i was wondering if usually coffee beans smell like this and that BT was somewhat of an exception or something wrong with my beans?


P.S- roast date on pack is 19 May 2025.

1kwkuee,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1kwkuee/my_best_friend_has_ended_our_friendship_and_i/,My best friend has ended our friendship and I miss him.,"I have a best friend who I met at work. In November conversation started picking up a lot. By February we were hanging out now and then. By march we were on the phone for hours a day, hanging out for hours whenever we got off work at the same time. He was absolutely my best friend. He was my safe place and my biggest supporter. We could talk about anything or nothing. Had all kinds of inside jokes. Told each other everything. Showed up with silly little surprises just to make each other smile. We talked about maybe trying dating at some point once we both had some time to work on ourselves. 

Well 2 weeks ago I fucked that all up. I said something to my coworker that I shouldn‚Äôt have. Something he told me about. I said it in defense of him but he didn‚Äôt take it that way. Basically she said some guy she talks to told her my friend is creepy and there are stories about him. Stay away from him. I said that‚Äôs bs. He‚Äôs an amazing person. He‚Äôs not creepy and your friend is bull shitting about the stories. Him and his dad have had it out for him for years. Well she told the guy I said that. Him and his dad approached my friend about it and he confronted me. We talked for about 3 hours. 

I apologized and said that I was just trying to defend him because they were talking shit.  That it just slipped out and I know I shouldn‚Äôt have said it. He was upset i didn‚Äôt tell him when it happened. I shouldn‚Äôt have responded and just told him about it and let him handle it like he‚Äôs told me before. He said I betrayed him and that it looks like I was just retaliating because he said we should cut back on communication some. I told him it‚Äôs not that. Why would I bring you lunch and a slice of my kids birthday cake if I wanted to retaliate against you or stab you in the back? It was a mistake and I‚Äôm so sorry. Asked him to forgive me. He said it would be forgivable if it wasn‚Äôt for the timing making it feel intentional. He said he was going to cut all communication. Said some mean things that I think were just out of anger. Then we got coffee and chatted like normal a bit. When he was getting out of the car to leave I asked him how I can fix it. He said basically if it‚Äôs meant to be it will be. I was in tears most of it all, and he was just calm and collected. 

I had a bag of gummy candies in my backpack that I was going to give him that day. Shaped like shaq. Because we were talking about shaq a few days before and they made me think of my friend. I handed them to him before he got out. He just stopped and was like shocked and thanked me and made a joke about the candy. I told him I‚Äôm always here if he changes his mind. Then he called me on my way home and we talked for another 20 minutes like normal. It gave me hope. 

Until the next day at work. I got the coldest ‚Äúsup‚Äù I‚Äôve ever heard when he walked in the room. I didn‚Äôt respond. I couldn‚Äôt. He walked by later and kind of hesitated but just left. Next time I saw him he just looked from across the room. The next time he walked into a hall I was in. He was avoiding eye contact but I said hey. He didn‚Äôt look at me. Turned down the closest hall and half waved. As soon as I got past he went back to main hall. Didn‚Äôt try again for a while. Then other day I said hey when I saw him clocking out. He looked at me this time. Gave one of those fake smiles you give strangers and nodded. But somehow just him looking at me gave me some hope. 

I‚Äôm pretty much broken at this point. How did we go from best friends to this? Over one little thing. I know he is weary of people, and not trusting, but he knows I would never do anything to hurt him intentionally. I owned up to my fuck up. Im in tears everyday. I lost my best friend and I don‚Äôt know how to get him back. I miss the calls, his goofy laugh, his conspiracy theories, everything. 

I don‚Äôt know how to fix it. Do I keep saying hi or stop? I got his fav candy bar out of habit at the vending machine right after this all went down. I want to give it to him, but I don‚Äôt know if I should. How do I show him I still care? How do I mend this? Or is it a lost cause??",1,1748345248.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

I have a male friend that I met through a team sport I play. We would see each other twice a week as a result. We started texting back in January but I never took it as anything more than friendship. We have hung out in a group setting maybe twice (he did not ask me on a date) and a few weeks ago he asked me to go for a coffee. It was fine but definitely no romantic spark. Nice guy but nothing other than friendship vibes for me. We have never so much as held hands or kissed or anything. The problem is the texting has become routine and I have no interest in it. I‚Äôve tried to phase it out but he isn‚Äôt getting the hint. I don‚Äôt want to send a ‚Äúi don‚Äôt see this going anywhere‚Äù text because at the end of the day we are friends and that‚Äôs all I see it as, so I don‚Äôt want to make it weird. But the sport is finished up now so I have no reason to see him and don‚Äôt want to be talking to him all the time. Especially because I do think he likes me and thinks this is something more than it is. 

How do I phase out the texting without making it awkward ? Happy to provide any additional info in comments ",2,1748345215.0,dating_advice,7,1.0,False

1kwkt9u,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1kwkt9u/i_didnt_want_to_lose_you_not_like_this/,I didn‚Äôt want to lose you. Not like this.,"Hey,

I don‚Äôt really know where to start. I‚Äôve rewritten this more times than I can count. Every time I try to find the right words, they all come out wrong. But here it is, anyway everything I wanted to say, and everything I was too afraid to repeat after things changed.

I liked you. No‚ÄîI cared about you. Genuinely. Not in a passing kind of way, not just because we worked together and saw each other every day. It was more than that. Your big brown eyes  that lit the room each time I seen you. The laughs we had together and the chemistry was unforgettable. It was the way you carried yourself. The way you love your family. The way you made the smallest things coffee breaks, shared glances, quiet conversations feel like something that mattered. 

You made showing up easier. Brighter. You were the best part of my routine. After years of not thinking of ‚Äòlove‚Äô I felt numb to it I never felt this way before but I then found you. For some reason I felt this warm feeling that reignited my spark. I had to know.

So I told you.

It took everything in me to say those words. You probably didn‚Äôt know how hard it was to be that vulnerable‚Äîto risk making things awkward, to risk losing what we had, whatever it was. But I thought maybe‚Ä¶ just maybe, you felt it too. 

You were kind. Gentle. We even hugged it out but something shifted.

You started pulling away. The way you spoke to me changed. Shorter words. Less warmth. Less of you. You stopped meeting my eyes the way you used to. And every day since, I‚Äôve been asking myself the same question: Did I ruin this just by being honest?

I didn‚Äôt expect anything from you. I didn‚Äôt tell you how I felt to pressure you, or to make things weird. I told you because it was real, and I couldn‚Äôt keep pretending like it wasn‚Äôt. You mattered to me. You still do. And I wish I could take all of that and explain it in a way that didn‚Äôt make you pull away. 

I miss the way we used to talk. I miss the lightness between us. I miss not feeling like I have to tiptoe around you now. And maybe it‚Äôs selfish, but I wish you‚Äôd said something‚Äîanything‚Äîto let me know it wasn‚Äôt the end of whatever we were. Every time I see you my heart skips a beat I just want it to stop, I can‚Äôt help it. 

 I didn‚Äôt want to lose you. Not like this. 

I‚Äôd rather have had you in my life as a friend, as a smile across the room, than feel this silence every day. But I won‚Äôt pretend I regret telling you how I felt. because I truly value you as a person and as a potential love partner you deserved to know. Even if it changed everything.

I don‚Äôt expect you to feel the same. I just hope, one day, if you ever think of me, you‚Äôll remember that someone truly cared. That someone looked at you and saw something rare, something beautiful. And meant every word.

Always,
Me

Just thought I‚Äôd put myself out there and try to find some chill people to talk to, hang out with, or just vibe with online. Even if you‚Äôre not in Abu Dhabi, we can still connect, chat, share interests, and who knows, maybe even meet up someday when the timing's hit right.

It caught my eye because of its promise of soft, chewable nugget ice and a compact, countertop-friendly design. Known for their chill-inducing texture and versatility, nugget ice machines are something I‚Äôve always been intrigued by‚Äîand this product seemed like the perfect match. But as much as there is to love about this device, there are also some quirks that require a close look.

**Design and Build**  
The compact size of this countertop nugget ice maker immediately stood out. Measuring just 11.81 x 9.01 x 12.9 inches, it fits snugly into my kitchen without hogging counter space, which is essential if you‚Äôve got limited room like I do. It also feels quite sturdy, though weighing 20.8 pounds, it‚Äôs not the most lightweight portable appliance out there. The glossy black finish gives it a premium, modern look that complements most kitchen decor. The transparent viewing window on top of the device is functional and oddly satisfying‚ÄîI‚Äôve caught myself staring through it, watching those little nugget ice cubes form.

**Key Benefits**  
- Produces soft, chewable nugget ice that's ideal for drinks or just snacking.  
- Compact design fits easily on most countertops.  
- Transparent window lets you monitor the ice-making process.  
- One-click operation is user-friendly, even for kids.  
- Self-cleaning function saves time and effort.  

[Grab COWSAR Z5815NH-BLACK at the best price on Amazon.](https://fridgefanatic.com/p/b0d4qckvck/)

**Performance and Ice Quality**  
Here‚Äôs where this machine really shines‚Äîit churns out up to 34 pounds of ice per day, which translates to nearly 48 cups of ice. Drinking iced coffee has become a whole new experience for me. The small, pebble-shaped ice cools drinks rapidly, enhancing the chill factor of smoothies, cocktails, or even plain water. My kids are obsessed with eating the ice on its own, and honestly, I can‚Äôt blame them. It‚Äôs a ridiculously satisfying texture to crunch on! However, I did notice that its performance can dip slightly on really hot days, as the surrounding temperature plays a role in how quickly the ice is produced.

**Ease of Use**  
Using this ice maker couldn‚Äôt be simpler. There‚Äôs a single button to start the process, making it incredibly intuitive. The built-in sensors automatically pause when the ice bin fills up or when the water runs out, and the LED indicators let you know what‚Äôs happening. That said, I wish the water tank had a visible indicator to check water levels at a glance instead of realizing it's out when the ice-making halts.

**Automatic Self-Cleaning**  
The self-cleaning mode on this machine might be its most underrated feature. Press a button, and the device essentially cleans itself‚Äîa lifesaver for busy weeks when I don‚Äôt feel like tackling appliance maintenance. For deeper cleaning, the detachable top allows easy access to tricky spots. I‚Äôve found that removing built-up scale is straightforward, provided you keep an eye on its usage. Regular upkeep is important to maintain its efficiency.

**Downsides**  
- As quiet as I‚Äôd like this machine to be, it‚Äôs not completely silent. The occasional crunching and water-pumping noises remind you it‚Äôs working.  
- It lacks a proper water level indicator, making refilling a guessing game sometimes.  
- On hotter summer days, the ice tends to melt faster, so it‚Äôs best to use it up quickly.  

**Competing Products**  
Comparing the COWSAR nugget ice maker to similar products, the highly popular GE Opal Nugget Ice Maker comes to mind. The Opal offers Bluetooth connectivity for scheduling, but at a much higher price point. For budget-conscious users, the COWSAR machine competes well by providing excellent ice quality and a compact footprint. The Igloo ICEB26HN also delivers good performance but misses out on features like self-cleaning. Between these options, I‚Äôd say the COWSAR strikes a sweet balance between price and features, although its noise levels are slightly higher compared to the pricier GE model.

**Quality for Price**  
In terms of functionality and feature set, this ice maker lands squarely in the realm of great value. It skips the unnecessary ‚Äúsmart‚Äù features in favor of simplicity and reliable performance. Considering what I‚Äôd spend on daily trips to grab soft nugget ice from the local coffee shop, this device pays for itself surprisingly quickly. Sure, it‚Äôs not perfect, but it packs plenty of value into a manageable price point.

I have bought two jackets, coffee mugs, statuettes, a limited edition watch, the entire trilogy three times, and still play the ME3 multiplayer on PC. What else is a super fan (who is also a professional software engineer) to do? The last year and a half, I‚Äôve been working on a project that I‚Äôve kept secret‚Ä¶ until now:

[Playtest of what I call Mass Effect Tactics (working title)](https://youtu.be/HRkSxCZFWoU)

The video above is a recording of a playtest of a card game concept set in the Mass Effect universe. It‚Äôs essentially a vertical slice of an MVP (Minimum Viable Product), showcasing basic gameplay, rules, cards, and UI aesthetics. Both players are working with the same predefined squad (two Soldiers, one Engineer, one Adept) and predefined deck (three abilities per class).

The network architecture is typical server-authoritative, with a dedicated server running locally (though player two is connecting remotely). Security was a design focus from the start, so every action taken by clients is validated by the server before being approved and updating other clients. The server also looks for messages or traffic from clients coming out of order, in the wrong phase, or using tracking IDs it shouldn‚Äôt know about (nor was ever sent). The server itself is designed for minimal startup time, optimized to run in a container for rapid deployment in a real-world setting.

Clients are Unity applications, utilizing [Fish-Networking](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/network/fishnet-networking-evolved-207815) for optimized network traffic and message control. All art assets not pulled from the Mass Effect games themselves were created by me. Audio files were extracted from the games, as well.

I have a lot of ideas for going forwards - upgrading ability cards (levels and rarity), squad member cards gaining ability-specific specializations and masteries based on what abilities they use the most, the rest of the weapons from Mass Effect 3, weapon and armor mods, not to mention many more abilities, UI improvements, proper sounds for weapon attacks (to include when partially blocked by cover). But‚Ä¶

I (30 F) never really had caffeine in my life, coffee and red bull were gross and tbh I was a jittery ball of energy regularly as a teen so never saw the benefit.

After years on Elvanse I finally came off last year and figured maybe caffeine could help me focus like Elvanse had.

I bought a pack of fruity matcha based cans 
And have just had the 4th one. 

The past two cans made me want to keep my limbs close and stand or sit very still. It doesn‚Äôt make me sleepy like other people say. I had the first 2 a while back and don‚Äôt think I felt this way???

It‚Äôs similar to a party drug I‚Äôve had in the past except now with the caffeine I have really bad anxiety. We always chalked that up to ADHD

I have bought two jackets, coffee mugs, statuettes, a limited edition watch, a blanket, the entire trilogy three times, and still play the ME3 multiplayer on PC. What else is a super fan (who is also a senior software engineer) to do? The last year and a half, I‚Äôve been working on a project that I‚Äôve kept secret‚Ä¶ until now:

[Playtest of what I call Mass Effect Tactics (working title)](https://youtu.be/HRkSxCZFWoU)

The video above is a recording of a playtest of a card game concept set in the Mass Effect universe. It‚Äôs essentially a vertical slice of an MVP (Minimum Viable Product), showcasing basic gameplay, rules, cards, and UI aesthetics. Both players are working with the same predefined squad (two Soldiers, one Engineer, one Adept) and predefined deck (three abilities per class).

The network architecture is typical server-authoritative, with a dedicated server running locally (though player two is connecting remotely). Security was a design focus from the start, so every action taken by clients is validated by the server before being approved and updating other clients. The server also looks for messages or traffic from clients coming out of order, in the wrong phase, or using tracking IDs it shouldn‚Äôt know about (nor was ever sent). The server itself is designed for minimal startup time, optimized to run in a container for rapid deployment in a real-world setting.

Clients are Unity applications, utilizing [Fish-Networking](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/network/fishnet-networking-evolved-207815) for optimized network traffic and message control. All art assets not pulled from the Mass Effect games themselves were created by me. Audio files were extracted from the games, as well.

I have a lot of ideas for going forwards - upgrading ability cards (levels and rarity), squad member cards gaining ability-specific specializations and masteries based on what abilities they use the most, the rest of the weapons from Mass Effect 3, weapon and armor mods, not to mention many more abilities, UI improvements, proper sounds for weapon attacks (to include when partially blocked by cover).

Multiple new restaurants are launching in Grand Traverse County, including J&S Hamburg expanding to Kingsley, smashed burger restaurant The Hammered Heifer coming to the former Rich‚Äôs Roadside Caf√© space, former Farm Club chef Dan Compton opening a ‚Äúmeat-and-three‚Äù Southern-inspired restaurant called Frank‚Äôs 231, and sushi spot Umai Eats operating on South Airport Road.¬†*The Ticker*¬†has the latest on these and more restaurant/retail updates from across the region.

**Restaurants**  
A new dining option is coming to Kingsley. Tiffany and Jason McQueer are targeting a mid-July opening of¬†**J&S Hamburg Kingsley**¬†in the former Cast Iron Kitchen space at 413 Main Street. Tiffany says the restaurant will have ‚Äúthe same great atmosphere as the one we have (on South Airport Road) in Traverse City,‚Äù plus a few surprises to come. The McQueers already have a cooler for Project Feed the Kids ‚Äì the duo‚Äôs nonprofit program that provides free packed meals for the community ‚Äì stationed in Kingsley and have long ties to the area.

Skip Ad

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be great for the Kingsley community,‚Äù Tiffany says. ‚ÄúWe have been there for over 20 years. We‚Äôve looked at (that space) for the last 10 years. The opportunity came up a few times, and now we‚Äôre going for it.‚Äù The McQueers are completing interior renovations ‚Äì ‚Äúit‚Äôs going to be a whole new look,‚Äù Tiffany says ‚Äì and hiring to expand their team. Days/hours of operation will be announced in the future. Terry Beia of Southtown Property Management ‚Äì which owns several commercial properties in Kingsley and has been wooing multiple businesses there the last several years ‚Äì says the ‚Äúentire village is thrilled with Tiffany and Jason‚Äôs decision to open another J&S location in Kingsley.‚Äù

Another family with long-time local ties is opening a new restaurant in Honor. Mogen McCallister ‚Äì son of Hofbrau owner Brian McCallister and a Hofbrau employee for nearly 10 years ‚Äì is targeting a late June opening of¬†**The Hammered Heifer**. The eatery will be located at 15273 Honor Highway in the space formerly held by Rich‚Äôs Roadside Caf√© and Paige‚Äôs Roadside Market & Pizza. The menu will feature smash burgers, soups and salads, veggie and chicken burgers, weekly specials, and a full bar.

A pole barn previously used for storage is being converted into an expanded dining area. A patio, picnic tables, and outdoors games like cornhole (plus possible ax throwing in the future) are all planned for the site. Mogen says he‚Äôs looking at potential hours of 11am-11pm seven days a week. In addition to his father‚Äôs restaurant, Mogen‚Äôs brother operates the KI (Kingsley Inn) in Kingsley ‚Äì with the family all involved in and supporting the various projects. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt break the family streak,‚Äù Mogen laughs. ‚ÄúThey all have faith in me.‚Äù

In Traverse City, former Farm Club chef Dan Compton and his wife Charlotte are aiming for a late June opening of¬†**Frank‚Äôs 231**. Inspired by Southern-style ‚Äúmeat-and-three‚Äù restaurants ‚Äì where customers choose a main protein and three sides ‚Äì the eatery will be located at 1779 S Garfield Ave (Suite A) in the former Cicero‚Äôs Pizza space across from the Cherryland Center. Dan‚Äôs background ‚Äì including as a butcher, sausage maker, and long-time Chicago chef ‚Äì has centered on a farm-to-table philosophy.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost a clich√© now, but I‚Äôve actually done it,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI do pickling and preserving so that summer crops are available to season food in the winter. I‚Äôve gotten to know small farmers working at Farm Club, so I‚Äôll be working with folks like Loma, Lakeview, and Second Spring.‚Äù

While Dan will be putting his sausage-making skills to work for the ‚Äúmeat‚Äù part of a ‚Äúmeat-and-three,‚Äù he says he loves working with produce and will offer several veggie sides and sandwiches, such as a griddled goat cheese sandwich with massaged kale and caramelized onion relish. Cornbread, buttermilk biscuits, and bacon-baked beans are examples of likely sides. The ‚Äúthree‚Äù part will also be optional, with customers also able to choose just one or two sides. Frank‚Äôs 231 will likely start out four days a week ‚Äì Friday-Monday 12pm-8pm ‚Äì with carryout and dine-in seating for about 25. The business won‚Äôt have a liquor license but will likely have Northwoods Soda, Leelanau Tea, and ‚Äúother interesting NA beverage options,‚Äù Dan says.

Around the corner on South Airport Road, Xee Yang ‚Äì a sushi chef with 25 years of experience ‚Äì and partner Xee Lao have opened¬†**Umai Eats**¬†in the former Papa John‚Äôs Pizza space at 1338 South Airport Road. The menu‚Äôs focus is sushi, onigiri, and pok√©, with bento and dinner special options to come. Dine-in, carryout, delivery, online ordering, and DoorDash are all available, with targeted hours of Monday-Friday 11am-8pm and Saturday-Sunday 12pm-8pm. The business is in a ‚Äúsoft launch‚Äù phase through June (and is closed through Wednesday this week), with an expected grand opening date to be announced after the National Cherry Festival.

Delamar Traverse City is preparing to debut a new all-day caf√© called¬†**Maison**, which will occupy the former Bistro space. Maison will blend ‚Äúthe spirit of northern Michigan hospitality with the charm of European caf√© culture,‚Äù according to a Delamar release, and feature fresh-baked pastries from The Mill and coffee from Panther Coffee. Breakfast and lunch offerings will include a rotating selection of artisan sandwiches, seasonal bites, and grab-and-go options available to both guests and locals.

Multiple dining options previously covered by¬†*The Ticker*¬†have officially opened their doors ‚Äì and a few have closed or are moving. Brunch spot¬†**Sisters**¬†on West Front Street,¬†**Nittolo‚Äôs Little Italy**¬†in the Warehouse District, and¬†**Tacos & Tequila**¬†(in the former Pacificoast space) are all now open. Korean food truck¬†**Heart N Seoul**¬†has returned to Earthen Ales for the summer, while¬†**De Food Truck**¬†is targeting a Friday or Saturday soft opening at the Interlochen Depot at 2689 J. Maddy Parkway. At The Coin Slot, taco truck¬†**Somewhere Over the Trompo**¬†and frozen custard/ice cream stand¬†**Super Cone**¬†are now officially up and running. The Coin Slot also plans to start offering Sunday pop-ups from Pakistani street food vendor¬†**Jadoo Bites**¬†‚Äì and has been making way for a new concept to anchor the indoor kitchen space occupied by¬†**Two Sons Pizza**. Two Sons owner Steve Tyson announced that his three-year lease expires at the end of 2025, and he‚Äôll be moving to a new TBD space that will offer more room and an expanded menu. In the meantime, Two Sons is open daily 11am-midnight for the summer season and has started accepting cash, Tyson says.

On Old Mission Peninsula,¬†**Seven Hills**¬†has added beer to its beverage offerings and is partnering with Heron Creek Food & Farms to provide evening dining options Sunday-Thursday. In Elk Rapids,¬†**Jac‚Äôs Family Restaurant**¬†has permanently closed its doors ‚Äì with the owner citing a need to focus on health and family.

**In other news...**  
After being¬†[sold in 2021 to cycling brand Specialized](https://www.traverseticker.com/news/mclain-cycle-fitness-sold-ending-44-year-run-for-owners/),¬†**McLain‚Äôs Cycle & Fitness**¬†is going through another period of transition. The company closed its Eighth Street store and has consolidated operations at its Garfield Avenue location. That store has reopened under the national¬†**ERIK‚ÄôS**¬†brand as a bike and winter sports shop ‚Äúoffering top-brand bicycles, e-bikes, gear, accessories, apparel, skis, snowboards, outerwear, bindings, and more.‚Äù

As¬†[first reported in¬†*The Ticker*](https://www.traverseticker.com/news/meijer-planning-new-traverse-city-store/),¬†**Meijer**¬†is opening its third Grand Traverse County store next to Menards at Chums Corner. Blair Township trustees recently approved Meijer‚Äôs special use/site plan application, clearing a major hurdle for the store to move forward. External Communications Manager Erin Cataldo says the company is still ‚Äúworking through some additional approvals,‚Äù however, ‚Äúso it‚Äôs too early to share timing‚Äù on the planned groundbreaking and store opening. Among the issues that will need to be addressed is access to the new store, including a potential new signalized intersection a half mile from the US-31/M-37 intersection.

Also at Chums Corner, new spirits shop¬†**GT Liquor**¬†has opened its doors in the former Rite Aid space. The company offers a ‚Äúhuge selection of premium liquor, craft beer, and fine wine all under one roof,‚Äù according to a post from manager Kevin Singh.

Then I discovered this setup that gave me back 15 hours per week.","Alright, so it's 12:23 AM and I just finished my last note of the day. But here's the crazy part - I've been home since 6 PM. Three months ago, I would've been here until 2 AM, probably crying into my third cup of coffee while my family slept.

I'm a family medicine doc in a mid-sized practice. Been doing this for 8 years, and I was literally planning my exit strategy. Not because I stopped loving patients, but because the documentation was slowly destroying my soul and my marriage.

My wife actually sat me down two months ago and said ""I feel like I'm married to Epic, not you."" That hit different.

So I went on this obsessive mission to figure out how to fix my documentation hell. Tested every EHR system I could get my hands on, tried voice recognition software, templates, macros - you name it.

Here's what I learned about EHRs after testing a bunch:

**Epic** \- Look, if you're at a big hospital system, you're stuck with it. It's powerful but feels like flying a Boeing 747 to go to the grocery store. Takes 47 clicks to do anything simple.

**Cerner** \- Actually got better after Oracle bought them. The AI features are decent, but it's still clunky as hell. Better than Epic for smaller practices though.

**Athenahealth** \- Not terrible. The billing integration is nice. But the interface looks like it was designed in 2003.

**NextGen** \- Great for specialists. Terrible for everything else. If you're not in a specialty, don't even bother.

**eClinicalWorks** \- Cheap and cheerful. Gets the job done but don't expect anything fancy. Perfect for small practices on a budget.

**Allscripts** \- Integration king. If you need to connect to 15 different systems, this is your friend. Otherwise, it's overkill.

**SmartClinix** \- This became my pick. $49/month, does everything I need without the bloat. Not the prettiest, but it doesn't crash every Tuesday like our old system.

But here's the real breakthrough - none of this mattered until I found PatientNotes.AI.

**My current setup:**

* EHR: SmartClinix ($49/month)
* AI Scribe: [PatientNotes.AI](http://PatientNotes.AI) ($59/month)
* Total: $108/month
* Time saved: 15+ hours/week
* My sanity: Restored

**What** [**PatientNotes.AI**](http://PatientNotes.AI) **actually does:** I just talk to my patients normally. The app listens to everything (HIPAA compliant, I checked obsessively). Then it generates a complete SOAP note that sounds exactly like I wrote it. Not some generic template - it literally learned how I document.

**Before vs After:**

* Used to stay until 10 PM finishing notes ‚Üí Now done by 5:30 PM
* Typed everything while avoiding eye contact ‚Üí Actually look at patients the entire visit
* Weekend ""catch-up"" sessions ‚Üí Weekends are for my family again
* Wife threatening divorce ‚Üí Marriage back on track

**The test that convinced me:** I tracked everything for 2 weeks. Saw 164 patients. Generated perfect documentation for every single encounter. Spent maybe 15 minutes total doing minor edits.

My nurse kept asking what medication I started taking because I seemed so relaxed.

**Real talk about the downsides:**

* It costs $59/month (but I was paying $200/month for a human scribe before)
* Takes about a week to learn your documentation style
* Sometimes gets confused with really complex patients (maybe 5% of cases)
* You need decent internet connection

**The integration part is huge** \- works with literally any EHR. Epic, Cerner, that ancient system your practice refuses to upgrade. Doesn't matter.

Last week my medical director pulled me aside asking how my productivity went up 35% while my documentation got better. I showed him the setup. Now half our practice is using it.

**For people asking about specialties:** I've talked to cardiologists, dermatologists, and even an orthopedic surgeon using this. It adapts to whatever specialty you are.

**Privacy concerns:** It's more secure than most EHR systems I've used. Everything is encrypted, HIPAA compliant, and they actually explain their security in plain English.

Look, I'm not getting paid for this. I'm just a burned-out doc who stumbled onto something that gave me my life back. If you're drowning in documentation like I was, [PatientNotes.AI](http://PatientNotes.AI) has a 7-day free trial.

Worst case, you waste 10 minutes setting it up. Best case, you remember why you became a doctor.

Three months ago I was ready to leave medicine. Today I actually enjoyed every patient interaction because I could focus on them instead of the computer screen.

Got my feet up, coffee in hand, and a free hour or five to kill.

Now I‚Äôll admit, I went in for the demo runs first. Gotta feel out the vibe before chucking real money. Both these games offer demos, and let me tell ya, they‚Äôre like night and day in style.

Fishin‚Äô Frenzy is your laid-back catch-of-the-day type. Chill soundtrack, classic slot feel, and if you‚Äôre lucky, a sneaky bonus round with fisherman wilds that reel in cash symbols. It‚Äôs not flashy, but it pays steady. Definitely one of the best non-sticky bonus setups I‚Äôve seen lately ‚Äì keeps the winnings from vanishing with the tide.

Now switch gears to Tome of Insanity ‚Äî this one‚Äôs a trip. Dark theme, cascading reels, insane visuals. If you‚Äôre into Lovecraftian madness and all that, this slot‚Äôs your jam. The bonus triggers are chaotic, and when that scatter explosion happens, it‚Äôs like your screen gets possessed. I hit a sweet 12x combo on the demo that had my heart racing like I just spotted a jackpot ghost.

But let‚Äôs talk review: Fishin‚Äô Frenzy wins on nostalgia and easy wins. Tome of Insanity? A freakin‚Äô rollercoaster. When it‚Äôs hot, it‚Äôs fire. When it‚Äôs cold, you‚Äôre getting slapped by tentacles.

TL;DR:

* Best for casual spinners: Fishin‚Äô Frenzy
* Best for adrenaline junkies: Tome of Insanity
* Both have demo and free play modes
* If you want non sticky bonus options, Fishin‚Äô Frenzy is your friend
* Want wild chaos and epic visuals? Dive into the Tome

From sipping Chinese tea at morning dim sum to indulging in British-style high tea, tea is woven into daily life here. While this tradition is nothing new, there‚Äôs an exciting new energy around Chinese tea in the city lately.

Traditionally, Chinese tea brings to mind the old-school tea shops in Sheung Wan‚Äîplaces with a nostalgic, but admittedly outdated, atmosphere. For many young people, these stores can feel unwelcoming or intimidating. But that‚Äôs changing fast! A new generation is working hard to make tea culture hip and approachable for everyone, not just the older crowd. It‚Äôs been a challenge, but they‚Äôre making real progress.

Recently, a tea market was held at the Tsim Sha Tsui Cultural Centre, and it was a huge success. The event drew lots of young people who got to sample different teas and see the culture in a fresh light.

It turns out, young people do like tea‚Äîthey just need easier access and a chance to try it without all the formality. The feedback from the event was overwhelmingly positive, and it feels like the tea scene is only going to keep growing.

While tea still isn‚Äôt as mainstream as coffee in Hong Kong, it‚Äôs definitely catching on. More people are discovering that tea drinking can be fun and stylish, without needing to master all the traditions or history. Just try some different teas and enjoy the experience!

1kwk781,https://youtu.be/GTLimepFwOg,3 Very Scary TRUE Camper Sleepwalking Horror Stories,"# ""The Road Downhill"":

I was on our annual camping trip with my son, Jordan, in the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness in Idaho. We‚Äôd pitched our tent near a quiet dirt road below Pinyon Peak, a spot we picked for its solitude and the way the valley opened up to a sky full of stars. The day had been perfect. We hiked a rugged trail, our boots crunching on pine needles, and Jordan kept pointing out animal tracks‚Äîdeer, maybe a fox. ‚ÄúDad, think we‚Äôll spot a bear this year?‚Äù he asked, grinning as we roasted hot dogs over the campfire later. The flames crackled, casting shadows on his face. ‚ÄúBetter not,‚Äù I chuckled, poking the fire with a stick. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs keep it calm, kid.‚Äù We swapped stories about past trips, laughing about the time he dropped his marshmallow in the dirt and tried to eat it anyway. By the time we crawled into our tent, I was bone-tired but content, wrapped in long johns, a long-sleeve cotton shirt, wool socks, and a light thermal layer. I hadn‚Äôt sleepwalked since I was a teenager, over fifty years ago, so I didn‚Äôt give it a thought as I drifted off.Sometime deep in the night, my eyes snapped open. I wasn‚Äôt in my sleeping bag. I was standing in the forest, barefoot, my heart thumping like a drum. The air was sharp, biting at my skin through my clothes. Trees towered around me, their branches like dark, twisted arms reaching out. My vision was blurry without my contacts, turning the world into a smear of shadows and shapes. I blinked hard, trying to make sense of it. How did I get here? My mind was foggy, like I was still half in a dream. Up on the ridge, I saw faint lights flickering, like houses glowing through the trees. My sleepy brain latched onto them‚Äîsafety, people, warmth. I started walking, my bare feet stumbling over roots and rocks, each step sending a jolt of pain through me. The ground was cold, rough, littered with pinecones that dug into my soles like tiny knives.I don‚Äôt know how long I walked before I tripped over a log and plunged into a creek. The water hit me like a slap, so cold it stole my breath. I gasped, flailing as the icy current soaked my clothes, weighing me down. I clawed my way to the bank, dragging myself onto the muddy edge, my teeth chattering so hard my jaw ached. The lights on the ridge were gone. No houses, no people‚Äîjust endless trees stretching into the dark. The truth hit me like a punch: I‚Äôd sleepwalked, and I was lost. Panic clawed at my chest, my heart racing so fast I thought it might burst. I was alone in the wilderness, wet, freezing, and barefoot, with no idea where our camp was.I hugged myself, trying to stop the shaking, but my clothes were plastered to my skin, already stiffening in the cold. My feet were numb, but every step sent a dull ache up my legs. I had to move, had to find the road. ‚ÄúDownhill,‚Äù I muttered, my voice trembling. ‚ÄúThe road‚Äôs downhill.‚Äù I remembered setting up camp near that dirt road, so I started walking, picking my way through the underbrush. Thorns snagged at my pants, and sharp rocks cut into my feet, but I kept going, driven by the fear of what would happen if I stopped. The forest was alive with sounds‚Äîtwigs snapping, leaves rustling, an owl hooting somewhere far off. Each noise made me flinch, my mind conjuring images of predators lurking just out of sight.‚ÄúJordan‚Äôs waiting,‚Äù I told myself, picturing his worried face. ‚ÄúYou have to get back to him.‚Äù But the forest seemed to stretch on forever. I walked one way for what felt like a mile, hoping to see our tent or the glow of our campfire. Nothing. I turned back, trying another direction, my legs heavy, my breath coming in short, ragged gasps. The moon broke through the clouds, casting a pale light that turned the trees into ghostly silhouettes. It helped me see, but it made everything feel wrong, like I was trapped in a nightmare I couldn‚Äôt wake from. My mind started playing tricks. I saw a house in the distance, its windows glowing warm, but when I got closer, it was just a boulder catching the moonlight. Later, I froze, thinking I saw an elk standing still, its eyes glinting, but it was only a gnarled tree stump. The cold was getting to me, sinking into my bones, making my thoughts sluggish.My feet were bleeding now, the soles raw and torn. Each step was agony, like walking on broken glass. I stopped to lean against a tree, my breath puffing out in clouds. ‚ÄúKeep moving,‚Äù I whispered, my voice barely audible. ‚ÄúYou stop, you die.‚Äù I‚Äôd read about hypothermia, how it creeps up, makes you tired, makes you see things that aren‚Äôt there. I was scared‚Äîscared I wouldn‚Äôt find the road, scared I‚Äôd collapse out here, scared Jordan would wake up to an empty tent. I pushed on, stumbling through the dark, my hands brushing against rough bark as I steadied myself. Hours passed, or maybe it just felt that way. Time was a blur, measured only by the pain in my feet and the growing weight of fear.Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, the trees thinned, and I saw open meadows. A dirt turnoff lay ahead, and there, like a miracle, was a camper, its windows glowing with soft light. My heart leapt, hope flaring despite the exhaustion. I staggered over, my legs barely holding me up, and knocked on the door, my knuckles stinging from the cold. It creaked open, and three guys stared at me, their faces a mix of shock and confusion. The oldest, with a gray beard and a flannel shirt, spoke first. ‚ÄúYou okay, man? What happened?‚Äù His voice was gruff but kind.‚ÄúI need help,‚Äù I croaked, my throat dry, my voice shaking. ‚ÄúI sleepwalked from my camp. I don‚Äôt know where I am.‚Äù The other two, younger guys with wide eyes, exchanged looks. ‚ÄúSleepwalked? Out here?‚Äù one said, his voice sharp with disbelief. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre soaked through.‚Äù The bearded guy pulled me inside, the warmth of the camper hitting me like a wave. ‚ÄúSit down,‚Äù he said, tossing a wool blanket over my shoulders. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs your camp?‚Äù I rubbed my hands together, trying to feel my fingers. ‚ÄúNear Pinyon Peak, by the dirt road. My son‚Äôs there. Jordan.‚Äù My voice cracked saying his name. The youngest guy, wearing a beanie, frowned. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs miles from here. You walked all that way barefoot?‚Äù I nodded, too tired to explain more.‚ÄúAlright, let‚Äôs get you back,‚Äù the bearded guy said, grabbing his keys. ‚ÄúName‚Äôs Tom, by the way. This is Dave and Chris.‚Äù He gestured to the others. ‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù I managed, my teeth still chattering. They helped me into their truck, the heater blasting hot air that felt like needles on my frozen skin. We drove down the dirt road, the headlights cutting through the dark. I kept my eyes peeled for our camp, my heart pounding with hope and fear. What if Jordan wasn‚Äôt there? What if he‚Äôd gone looking for me?When we finally reached the spot, I saw Jordan outside the tent, pacing, his flashlight beam swinging wildly. ‚ÄúDad!‚Äù he shouted, running toward the truck as I stumbled out. His face was pale, his eyes red, like he‚Äôd been crying. ‚ÄúWhere were you? I woke up, and you were gone. I looked everywhere!‚Äù His voice broke, and he threw his arms around me, nearly knocking me over. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm okay, Jordan,‚Äù I said, hugging him back, my legs wobbling. ‚ÄúI sleepwalked. Got lost.‚Äù He pulled back, looking me over, and his eyes widened at my feet‚Äîpurple, swollen, streaked with blood and dirt. ‚ÄúDad, your feet‚Ä¶ we need to get you to a hospital,‚Äù he said, his voice tight with worry.Tom stepped forward, his face serious. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lucky, man. This wilderness doesn‚Äôt mess around.‚Äù I nodded, my throat too tight to speak. ‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù I said again, shaking their hands. Chris, the quiet one, gave me a small smile. ‚ÄúGet warm, alright? And maybe lock your tent next time.‚Äù They drove off, their taillights fading into the dark. Jordan helped me to our car, wrapping another blanket around me. ‚ÄúI was so scared, Dad,‚Äù he said as we started driving to town. ‚ÄúI thought‚Ä¶ I thought you were gone.‚Äù I reached over, squeezing his shoulder. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here, kid. I‚Äôm not going anywhere.‚ÄùAt the hospital, the doctor cleaned my feet, bandaging the cuts and treating early frostbite. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lucky you didn‚Äôt lose any toes,‚Äù he said, his tone matter-of-fact. ‚ÄúAnother few hours out there, and it could‚Äôve been worse.‚Äù I lay back on the exam table, exhausted, the fear still lingering like a bad taste. Jordan sat beside me, his face still pale. ‚ÄúNext time, we‚Äôre tying you to the sleeping bag,‚Äù he said, trying to joke, but his voice shook. I managed a weak smile. ‚ÄúDeal.‚ÄùThat night replayed in my head for weeks‚Äîthe cold, the dark, the way the forest seemed to close in around me. I‚Äôd always loved the wilderness, felt at home in it, but that night, it was something else. It was alive, waiting, ready to swallow me whole if I let it. I still camp with Jordan, but now we lock the tent, and I keep my shoes close. Just in case.





# ""The Forest Was Silent‚ÄîUntil I Woke Up Somewhere I Shouldn‚Äôt Be"":

I was on a solo backpacking trip in Colorado‚Äôs San Juan National Forest, craving the quiet of the wilderness to escape the noise of my life back home. I‚Äôd hiked these trails before, so I felt confident picking a spot to camp near a rocky outcrop by a gurgling stream. The plan was simple: three days of hiking, sleeping under the stars, and clearing my head. I had no clue that my first night would spiral into a nightmare, all because of sleepwalking‚Äîsomething I didn‚Äôt even know I could do.The day had been grueling. I‚Äôd trekked eight miles up steep, winding trails, my pack heavy with gear. My legs ached, and my shoulders burned from the straps digging in. By the time I found a flat spot to camp, I was wiped out. The site was perfect, or so I thought‚Äîa small clearing surrounded by towering pines, with the stream nearby and a rocky slope dropping off about 20 feet to a jagged ravine below. I didn‚Äôt think much of the drop; it was far enough from my tent, maybe 10 yards. I set up my one-person tent, hammering stakes into the hard ground, and cooked a quick meal on my camp stove‚Äînoodles with a packet of tuna, washed down with a protein bar. Sitting by the stream, I watched the water ripple over smooth stones, the sound calming my nerves. I felt alone, but in a good way, like the forest was mine.Before crawling into my tent, I double-checked everything: stove off, food bag tied high in a tree to keep bears away, flashlight tucked in my pocket. I changed into a thermal shirt, long pants, and thick wool socks, then zipped myself into my sleeping bag. The tent‚Äôs nylon walls felt like a cocoon, safe and snug. I didn‚Äôt bother zipping the door all the way, leaving it half-open for air. My last thought before drifting off was how peaceful it was, the stream‚Äôs murmur lulling me to sleep. I had no idea my body was about to betray me.I don‚Äôt know how long I was out, but I woke to a jolt of pain so sharp it stole my breath. My face was pressed against cold, jagged rocks, grit digging into my cheek. My hands burned, scraped raw, and my left ankle screamed like it was trapped in a bear trap. My head throbbed, and something warm trickled down my temple‚Äîblood, I realized, touching it with trembling fingers. It was pitch black, the kind of dark where you can‚Äôt see your own hands. My heart hammered as I tried to make sense of where I was. I wasn‚Äôt in my tent. I was outside, sprawled on a rocky slope, the ground uneven beneath me. Panic clawed at my chest. Had I sleepwalked? I‚Äôd never done it before, not even as a kid. The idea was absurd, but there was no other explanation.I tried to sit up, but my ankle buckled under me, sending a fresh wave of pain up my leg. I gasped, collapsing back onto the rocks. My socks were gone, my feet bare and stinging from the cold. My thermal shirt was torn at the elbow, and my pants were damp, clinging to my legs. I fumbled for my phone in my pocket‚Äîgone. My flashlight, too. No light, no way to call for help. ‚ÄúHelp!‚Äù I shouted, my voice hoarse. ‚ÄúIs anyone there?‚Äù The sound echoed off the rocks, swallowed by the vastness of the forest. Nothing answered but the stream‚Äôs faint gurgle and a rustle of leaves somewhere nearby. I was alone, injured, and had no idea how far I‚Äôd wandered from my tent.My mind raced, pulling up a story I‚Äôd read years ago about a guy in Kentucky, 2014, who sleepwalked off a 60-foot cliff while camping in the Red River Gorge. He‚Äôd survived by pure luck, landing in a bush. The thought made my stomach lurch. I felt around, my hands shaking as they brushed over loose gravel and sharp stones. I was on a slope, steeper than I‚Äôd realized, with the ravine below me. If I‚Äôd taken one more step in my sleep, I could‚Äôve plummeted further. The drop wasn‚Äôt as high as that guy‚Äôs, but 20 feet onto rocks was enough to kill me. My breath hitched as I imagined my body broken at the bottom, unseen in the dark.‚ÄúStay calm,‚Äù I muttered to myself, my voice trembling. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre alive. Find the tent.‚Äù I forced myself to crawl, dragging my bad ankle, each movement sending fire through my leg. My hands groped the ground, feeling pine needles, cold dirt, and more rocks. Every few feet, I stopped to listen, hoping for a sign of my camp‚Äîthe stream, maybe, or the rustle of my tent. But the forest was disorienting, every shadow blending into the next. I kept talking to keep the panic at bay: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll find it. Just follow the stream. It‚Äôs close.‚Äù But doubt crept in. What if I was crawling deeper into the wilderness? What if I was nowhere near my camp?The cold was sinking in now, my fingers numb, my clothes damp from the ground. My teeth chattered, and I started to shiver uncontrollably. I knew enough about hypothermia to be scared‚Äîalone, injured, and wet in the middle of the night wasn‚Äôt good. I tried to focus on moving, but my mind kept conjuring threats. A branch snapped somewhere to my left, and I froze, heart pounding. ‚ÄúJust an animal,‚Äù I whispered, but my imagination painted worse‚Äîbears, mountain lions, things I‚Äôd dismissed in daylight. Another sound came, a low grunt, far off but close enough to make my skin crawl. I held my breath, waiting. It didn‚Äôt come again, but the silence felt heavier, like the forest was watching me.I don‚Äôt know how long I crawled‚Äîmaybe an hour, maybe two. Time blurred, each second stretching into eternity. My hands were bloody now, cut from the rocks, and my ankle was swollen, the pain making me dizzy. I started seeing things‚Äîshapes in the dark, like a tent or a trail sign, but when I reached out, they were just bushes or trees. My mind was playing tricks, exhaustion and fear mixing into a haze. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not going to die out here,‚Äù I told myself, but the words felt hollow. I thought about my family, my friends, wondering if they‚Äôd ever find me. The guy from that Kentucky story had been lucky. Would I be?Then, I heard it‚Äîthe stream, louder now, its steady gurgle cutting through the quiet. Hope surged, giving me a burst of energy. I crawled faster, ignoring the pain, following the sound. My hand brushed something soft‚Äîmy sleeping bag, tangled in a cluster of bushes. I almost cried with relief. I followed the fabric, my fingers tracing it like a lifeline, until I felt the familiar nylon of my tent. I‚Äôd wandered maybe 50 yards, down the slope and into the brush. How I hadn‚Äôt fallen further, I‚Äôll never know. I crawled inside, zipping the door shut with shaking hands, and collapsed onto the tent floor, my breath ragged. My ankle throbbed, my hands bled, but I was safe. For now.I didn‚Äôt sleep the rest of the night. I sat up, clutching my small camp knife, jumping at every sound outside. The forest felt alive, hostile, like it had tried to swallow me. I kept replaying what happened‚Äîunzipping the tent, walking out, stumbling down the slope, all while asleep. It was terrifying, not knowing what my own body was capable of. I thought about that Kentucky guy again, how he‚Äôd stepped off a cliff without waking. He‚Äôd had friends to find him. I was alone, with no one to hear me fall.At first light, I assessed the damage. My ankle was purple, swollen to twice its size. My hands were a mess of cuts and bruises, and a gash on my forehead had crusted over with blood. I packed up as best I could, using a stick as a crutch, and hobbled back to the trailhead‚Äîa slow, agonizing mile. Every step felt like a gamble, my ankle threatening to give out. When I finally reached my car, I sat in the driver‚Äôs seat, hands shaking on the wheel, too rattled to move. I drove to the nearest ranger station, limping inside like a ghost.The ranger, a woman with gray streaks in her hair, took one look at me and stood up. ‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù she asked, her voice sharp with concern.  
‚ÄúI sleepwalked,‚Äù I said, my voice barely above a whisper. ‚ÄúFell down a slope. I think my ankle‚Äôs sprained, maybe worse.‚Äù  
Her eyes widened as she grabbed a first-aid kit. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lucky you didn‚Äôt go over the edge. We had a guy a while back, sleepwalked off a cliff in Kentucky. Barely survived.‚Äù  
I nodded, my stomach twisting. ‚ÄúI heard about that.‚Äù  
‚ÄúSit down,‚Äù she said, wrapping a blanket around me. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll get you to a clinic.‚ÄùThey drove me to a small hospital, where a doctor cleaned my cuts and confirmed a severe ankle sprain, no fracture, thankfully. I had bruises everywhere, a mild concussion from hitting my head, and needed stitches for the gash on my forehead. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lucky,‚Äù the doctor said, adjusting his glasses. ‚ÄúPeople don‚Äôt always walk away from falls like that.‚Äù  
‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt even know I could sleepwalk,‚Äù I said, still stunned.  
‚ÄúNew places can trigger it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúStress, too. You need to be careful camping alone. Maybe get a tether for your sleeping bag next time.‚ÄùWhen I got home, I called my friend Jake, needing to tell someone.  
‚ÄúYou could‚Äôve died,‚Äù he said, his voice tight. ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you tell me you were going out there by yourself?‚Äù  
‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think I had to,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never sleepwalked before. I didn‚Äôt know.‚Äù  
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs creepy as hell,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYour own body just... taking over like that.‚Äù  
‚ÄúI know,‚Äù I said, my throat tight. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going back out there without a plan. Tether, locks, something.‚ÄùI haven‚Äôt returned to the wilderness since. Every time I think about camping, I see myself waking up on that slope, the dark pressing in, the grunt in the distance. The scariest part isn‚Äôt the fall or the pain‚Äîit‚Äôs that I had no control. My body moved without me, leading me straight into danger. I keep a tether by my bed now, just in case, and I check it every night, wondering if I‚Äôll ever feel safe again.





# ""The Light Beyond the Trees"":

The knot in my stomach wouldn‚Äôt loosen. My friend Alex had been sleepwalking since we were kids, wandering his house in the dead of night, but out here in the vast wilderness of the Appalachian Trail, it felt like a ticking time bomb. We‚Äôd come to camp, just the two of us, to escape the grind of city life, to breathe fresh air and reconnect like we used to. The first night was peaceful‚ÄîAlex snored softly in his sleeping bag, the forest humming with crickets, and I didn‚Äôt give his old habit a second thought. But on the second night, everything turned upside down.I woke to a faint rustling outside the tent, like leaves being crushed underfoot. My eyes snapped open, my pulse already racing. I reached for Alex‚Äôs sleeping bag, expecting to feel his shoulder, but my hand met empty fabric. ‚ÄúAlex?‚Äù I whispered, sitting up so fast my head spun. No answer. The air felt heavy, the kind of stillness that makes your skin prickle, like the forest itself was holding its breath.I fumbled for my flashlight, my fingers clumsy with panic, and unzipped the tent. Stepping out, I swept the beam across the campsite. The fire pit was cold, our gear neatly stacked, but Alex was gone. ‚ÄúAlex!‚Äù I called, louder now, my voice sharp against the silence. The trees seemed to swallow the sound, their shadows shifting in the flashlight‚Äôs glow, making every branch look like a claw reaching out.I scanned the ground and froze. There, in the soft dirt near the tent, were footprints‚Äîbare, uneven, unmistakably Alex‚Äôs. He hadn‚Äôt even grabbed his boots. My heart sank. The forest floor was a minefield of jagged rocks, thorny vines, and hidden roots, not to mention the drop-offs and streams that lurked beyond our clearing. Sleepwalking here wasn‚Äôt just dangerous‚Äîit could be deadly.I followed the tracks, my flashlight trembling in my grip. The beam caught glints of dew on leaves, making them shimmer like eyes in the dark. Every step felt like wading deeper into a nightmare. ‚ÄúAlex, where are you?‚Äù I shouted, my voice cracking. The forest didn‚Äôt answer, but every rustle of leaves, every snap of a twig, made my heart lurch. Was it an animal? The wind? Or just my imagination, twisted by fear?The footprints led deeper into the woods, away from the safety of our camp. I stumbled over a root, catching myself on a tree, the bark rough against my palm. My breath came in short gasps, the air thick with the scent of pine and damp earth. Then I heard it‚Äîa soft, mumbled voice, barely audible, like someone talking in their sleep. I pushed through a tangle of branches, ignoring the scratches on my arms, until I saw him.Alex stood by a gnarled oak, his bare feet sinking into the mud, his t-shirt and boxers clinging to his shivering frame. His arms hung limp, his head tilted slightly, staring into the darkness with glassy, unfocused eyes. He looked like a stranger, not the friend I‚Äôd known for years.‚ÄúAlex,‚Äù I said, keeping my voice low, remembering you‚Äôre not supposed to wake a sleepwalker too suddenly. I stepped closer, the ground squishing under my boots. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs me. Let‚Äôs go back to the tent.‚ÄùHe turned slowly, his movements jerky, like a puppet on strings. His eyes locked on mine, but they weren‚Äôt seeing me. ‚ÄúI need to find it,‚Äù he mumbled, his voice low and eerie, like it was coming from somewhere else.‚ÄúFind what?‚Äù I asked, my throat tight. I glanced around, half-expecting to see something in the shadows.‚ÄúThe light,‚Äù he said, raising a trembling hand to point into the black void of the forest. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs calling me. Can‚Äôt you hear it?‚ÄùI swallowed hard, my mouth dry. There was no light, no sound, just the endless maze of trees and shadows that seemed to shift when I wasn‚Äôt looking. ‚ÄúAlex, there‚Äôs nothing there,‚Äù I said, stepping closer. ‚ÄúCome on, let‚Äôs go back.‚Äù I reached for his arm, my fingers brushing his cold skin. He didn‚Äôt resist, but he didn‚Äôt move either, his body rigid, like he was still caught in a dream.I gently tugged his arm, guiding him back toward the camp. His bare feet dragged, stumbling over roots and rocks, and I winced every time he stepped on something sharp. ‚ÄúAlmost there,‚Äù I said, more to myself than to him. The walk back felt endless, the forest pressing in, every shadow a threat. When we finally reached the tent, I helped him into his sleeping bag, tucking it around him like he was a kid again. He mumbled something incoherent, his eyes fluttering shut. I sat there, flashlight still in hand, watching his chest rise and fall, my mind racing with what could have happened. What if I hadn‚Äôt woken up? What if he‚Äôd wandered into a stream or off a cliff?Morning came, and Alex woke up groggy, rubbing his eyes. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs with the face?‚Äù he asked, noticing my tense expression as I stirred instant coffee over our small camp stove.‚ÄúYou sleepwalked last night,‚Äù I said, keeping my voice steady. ‚ÄúYou were out in the woods, barefoot, talking about some light that wasn‚Äôt there.‚ÄùHis face fell, a mix of surprise and embarrassment. ‚ÄúI thought I was over that,‚Äù he said, running a hand through his messy hair. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, man. I didn‚Äôt mean to freak you out.‚Äù‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine,‚Äù I lied, handing him a mug. ‚ÄúJust‚Ä¶ scared me, is all. You were so far out there.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt mention how my heart was still pounding, how the forest felt different now, like it was watching us.We stayed close to camp that day, sticking to safe tasks like gathering firewood and boiling water. But Alex was quieter than usual, his eyes darting to the tree line every so often. As evening fell, we sat by the campfire, the flames casting flickering shadows that danced across the clearing.‚ÄúDid you hear that?‚Äù Alex said suddenly, his voice low, his body tense.I froze, listening. The fire popped, and an owl hooted in the distance, but nothing else. ‚ÄúHear what?‚Äù I asked, my pulse quickening.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like‚Ä¶ whispering,‚Äù he said, his eyes scanning the darkness beyond the firelight. ‚ÄúLike it‚Äôs saying my name.‚ÄùI strained to hear, but there was nothing‚Äîjust the usual forest sounds. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs probably the wind through the trees,‚Äù I said, though I wasn‚Äôt sure. The wilderness had a way of messing with your head, making you hear things that weren‚Äôt there. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just keep the fire going and stay calm, okay?‚ÄùHe nodded, but his hands gripped his knees tightly, and I could tell he wasn‚Äôt convinced. We turned in early, the tension between us thick. I didn‚Äôt want to take chances tonight. I dug through my pack and found a small bell, the kind you‚Äôd tie to a dog‚Äôs collar, and looped it around Alex‚Äôs ankle with some cord. ‚ÄúThis‚Äôll wake me if you move,‚Äù I explained, trying to sound casual.He gave a weak smile. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre babysitting me now?‚Äù‚ÄúSomething like that,‚Äù I said, forcing a laugh. But as I zipped up the tent, the unease settled deeper. Sleep came in fits, my dreams filled with shadows and cliffs.A faint jingle yanked me awake. My heart lurched‚ÄîAlex‚Äôs sleeping bag was empty, the bell still tinkling faintly in the distance. ‚ÄúNo, not again,‚Äù I muttered, scrambling for my flashlight. I unzipped the tent and plunged into the darkness, the beam cutting through the night. The bell‚Äôs chime was moving away, fast, deeper into the forest.I ran, my boots pounding the uneven ground, branches snapping against my face. The forest felt alive, every shadow shifting, every sound amplified. Then I heard it‚Äîa low, guttural growl, close enough to make my blood freeze. It wasn‚Äôt human. A bear, maybe, or a mountain lion. The wilderness was full of predators, and Alex was out there, oblivious, wandering in his sleep.‚ÄúAlex!‚Äù I shouted, my voice raw with panic. The growl stopped, replaced by a heavy silence that pressed against my ears. I followed the bell‚Äôs faint jingle, my flashlight shaking so badly the beam danced wildly. The ground grew rockier, the trees thinner, and I realized we were nearing a ridge. My stomach dropped‚ÄîI‚Äôd seen it on the map, a steep drop-off that plunged into a ravine below.I pushed through a final cluster of bushes and saw him. Alex stood at the very edge, his bare feet inches from the drop, his body swaying slightly. Beyond him, the ground fell away into a black void, too deep for my flashlight to reach the bottom. My heart pounded so hard I thought it might burst.‚ÄúAlex, don‚Äôt move!‚Äù I yelled, sprinting toward him. He turned, his eyes wide and glassy, and mumbled, ‚ÄúI have to see it. It‚Äôs down there.‚Äù‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing there!‚Äù I shouted, my voice breaking. He took a step forward, his foot hovering over the edge. ‚ÄúNo!‚Äù I lunged, grabbing his arm and yanking him back. We crashed to the ground, my flashlight rolling away, its beam spinning wildly. I held onto him, my chest heaving, adrenaline burning through me. ‚ÄúWake up, Alex, please.‚ÄùHe blinked, his face shifting from blank to confused, then horrified as he saw the drop-off. ‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶ where are we?‚Äù he stammered, his voice trembling. He looked down at his muddy feet, the bell still tied to his ankle, and then at the cliff‚Äôs edge. ‚ÄúI was‚Ä¶ I almost‚Ä¶‚Äù‚ÄúYou were sleepwalking,‚Äù I said, my voice shaking as much as his. ‚ÄúYou were about to walk off that cliff.‚ÄùHis face went pale, his hands trembling as he clutched my arm. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know. I could‚Äôve‚Ä¶ oh God.‚Äù‚ÄúWe‚Äôre leaving,‚Äù I said, pulling him to his feet. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre packing up and getting out of here. Now.‚ÄùWe stumbled back to camp, the bell jingling with every step, a haunting reminder of how close we‚Äôd come to disaster. We packed in silence, our movements frantic, the forest looming around us like a living thing, indifferent to our fear. As we hiked back to the trailhead, every snap of a twig, every rustle in the bushes, made me flinch. The wilderness didn‚Äôt care about us‚Äîit was vast, unforgiving, ready to swallow us whole if we let our guard down.We reached the car just as dawn broke, the sky lightening but doing nothing to ease the weight in my chest. Alex was quiet, staring out the window as we drove away, his face etched with guilt and fear. I kept seeing him on that cliff, his foot hovering over the edge, the growl echoing in the dark. We‚Äôd escaped, but the memory of that night‚Äîof the forest‚Äôs silent threat, of Alex‚Äôs blank eyes‚Äîwould stay with me forever, a reminder that even the simplest things, like a walk in your sleep, could lead you straight into danger.",1,1748342998.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

I currently have a pre-order in place for the xreal pro, but every month it seems to be delayed another month so I'm considering canceling and moving to viture.

One thing that has me holding off though is one of the things I was hoping to use the glasses for is some productivity when I am traveling away from home/office. I have to work in ""not ideal"" working conditions for +/- 1-2 weeks at a time (think a coffee shop but worse) when all I have is my laptop screen. I am used to working with at least two 24"" displays or an ultrawide + 24"" display, so the transition to a 13"" laptop screen on its own is......yeah.

The downside though, is I cant install any additional software onto my work laptop, so, how do the glasses work when connected to a windows laptop without spacewalker?

My dream would be to have a second/third virtual monitor I can view with the glasses, but still use my laptop screen. Ideally pinning the virtual screens in space so I can turn towards/away from them.

It was someone (I'm sorry I couldn't find the original) posting about how they didn't want to eat the last of their partner's frozen spaghetti sauce, because it meant more of them was disappearing. Suddenly the comments were filled with things people couldn't approach anymore because of loss, and I was crying. I know exactly what that feels like, to be haunted by mundane objects because *everything* is a reminder of your person, and that they aren't here anymore.

I started a [Substack ](https://substack.com/@kalissimo)recently where I write about grief. It helps me a lot, and I'm hoping to help others too. Because even when it hurts, seeing my pain reflected back at me is one of the only ways I feel less alone. So I wanted to share my most recent Substack post here, in honour of all of us who are reduced to tears over leftover spaghetti sauce and watermelon chewing gum.

*This is for you:*

**Watermelon.**

When someone you love dies, there are so many ridiculous things that give you trauma.

The self-service checkout screen supermarket. Not *our* supermarket‚ÄîI can‚Äôt go there. But it doesn‚Äôt matter. All the screens are the same. Same layout, same beep, same buttons. Remembering we used to sneak off together during lunch breaks ‚Äú*Let‚Äôs go get an ice cream*!‚Äù‚Äîjust fifteen minutes, his hand in mine, stealing moments between meetings like teenagers with jobs. Then back up the elevator, back to our desks. Pretending to be colleagues. Everyone knew, obviously. But we didn‚Äôt flaunt it. We didn‚Äôt need to. We lived together, woke up together, went to sleep together. Life was full. Complete. Intact.

Now I can‚Äôt walk past our old office without falling apart. I tell myself it‚Äôs just a building. But it‚Äôs not.

It‚Äôs where we fell in love.

It‚Äôs where we became *us*.

It‚Äôs where I used to get butterflies just knowing I‚Äôd see him in the morning‚Äîeven if it was only across a conference room. It‚Äôs where he brought me coffee one morning after I‚Äôd been up all night with the kids‚Äînavigating the messy adjustment of single motherhood. My bus was late, so by the time I arrived, it had gone cold. He apologised, awkward and sweet. He‚Äôd remembered I drank oat milk. I smiled and drank it cold. We weren‚Äôt even together yet, but I wondered‚Äî*was this a sign?* It felt like one.

That was also the day I wore a beige top‚Äînot low-cut, just a normal scooped neckline. Totally work-appropriate in the morning. But I‚Äôd recently come back after a year-long maternity leave, and I was still breastfeeding, which meant my body hadn‚Äôt quite figured out how much milk it was supposed to make. By lunchtime, my boobs had practically doubled in size. That sweet little top suddenly looked like I was headed to a boozy bar. I spent the second half of the morning crossing my arms, tugging it down, trying to disappear.

He noticed. Quietly handed me his scarf‚Äîthis soft, oversized shawl he wore sometimes‚Äîand didn‚Äôt say a word. I messaged him later to thank him.

He replied, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre welcome.‚Äù

And then:  
*Do you know how much control it took*  
*to*  
*look*  
*at*  
*your*  
*eyes* üòÇ

It was the first time he really flirted with me. And I was glowing. I had to put my phone down just to stop smiling.

I can‚Äôt go to Starbucks without remembering New York.

It was my first time in the U.S. He was showing me his world. I loved seeing where he‚Äôd grown up. I was taking it all in‚Äîyellow taxis, the steam rising up from the street vents, the smell of bagels, the noise. It felt like a movie. I was exploring a whole new piece of him.

He‚Äôd taken a sudden bad turn‚Äîno one knew why‚Äîand I rushed him to Bellevue. I didn‚Äôt realise then that it‚Äôs one of the busiest hospitals in New York. It also treats inmates from Rikers and other correctional facilities, so the place was *wild*: phones ringing off the hook, police posted at every corner, patients in handcuffs, people shouting across corridors.

At one point, a prisoner being wheeled past actually spat at me.

It was a far cry from the calm, sterile hospitals back home in Norway.

And somehow, later, we laughed about that.

He said, ‚Äú*Now you‚Äôve had the real New York experience.*‚Äù

It was Halloween‚Äîmy favourite holiday‚Äîand we‚Äôd planned to celebrate it properly in the city that knows how. Instead, I woke up early and walked the streets alone. Yellow taxis cutting through the cold. Steam rising from the subway vents. I got in line at a Starbucks and ordered a pumpkin spice latte for both of us‚Äîhe‚Äôd wanted to try it even though he was sure he would hate it. In that moment, it felt like a highlight of my life. I brought it back to the hospital like a care package, hoping it would give him a taste of something warm. Something normal. Something seasonal.

*We loved Autumn.*

Another hospital night, I went out to pick up Korean food for him‚Äîcomfort food. While I was waiting, I ended up at the bar next to someone who recognised me.

‚ÄúAre you his partner?‚Äù he asked. I hadn‚Äôt seen anyone. But clearly, we stood out.

He turned out to be a junior staff member from the hospital. He offered to share his soju with me and, quietly, explained to me what he could. What the tests they‚Äôd done meant. What they were trying. What new tests I could ask for. It helped. We talked for over an hour‚Äîabout work, life, crossroads. He was young, trying to decide whether to stay and do what he loved for less money, or take a higher-paying job in a city that didn‚Äôt quite feel like home. I don‚Äôt remember what I told him. Just that it felt like the right thing in the moment. And that I meant it.

I can‚Äôt see our friends now. The ones who loved him just as fiercely. Because when I think of them, I don‚Äôt see cabin trips or dinners or nights out‚ÄîI see black suits. I see tears. I see the white cardigan with silver buttons I wore. The black silk skirt. I see us carrying his coffin together. Me and his best friends, gripping the weight of him. I hear the sound of my heels against the church floor.

I can‚Äôt throw away the random paper I found with his signature, because I don‚Äôt have it anywhere else. I can‚Äôt use the little pot of chilli flakes he kept in his kitchen. I know he poured them in by hand. Using them up feels like erasing him.

I can‚Äôt chew watermelon gum. It reminds me of the first time we kissed. And God‚Äîwhat a kiss. It was *perfect*. Tension snapped into joy. I‚Äôd waited for it. Wanted it. I bought watermelon gum on the way home just to hang onto the moment longer.

I can‚Äôt look at my work laptop without seeing his hands. His beautiful hands. Long fingers. That scar I never asked about. Three freckles on the back of his right hand, shaped like a triangle. We used to work side by side on the sofa, in total silence. Focused. Content. I loved professional him. I loved all of him. 

I still do.

I can‚Äôt listen to the playlists he made before he died. At first, they were all I listened to. Now I can‚Äôt touch them. There‚Äôs a lot I *could* do in the beginning that I *can‚Äôt* do now. Grief is like that. It doesn‚Äôt fade. It reverses.

I can‚Äôt

understand

how he‚Äôs 

*Gone.*

How the thought of him still lights up my body like a live wire‚Äîbut there‚Äôs no one to give it to. No hand to reach for. No skin to press into. My body still responds like we‚Äôre in love. Like he‚Äôll walk into the room. Like he‚Äôs late, not gone. I still feel the pull of him. Still remember the weight of his body next to mine. The warmth of him. My whole body anticipates him.

And then the crash. Like being dropped into cold water.

Because there‚Äôs no body anymore. Because when I held his hand in the coffin, I expected it would be stiff. Plastic. But it wasn‚Äôt. His skin was soft. Still *his* skin. Just cold. Ice cold. He had never been cold before.

I started writing at first to try to reach someone. Anyone. To offer the kind of honesty that helped me when I was drowning. But now I write because I have to. The grief builds and builds and has nowhere to go. The love still lives in me, but he doesn‚Äôt.

I write because I want to go back.

Back to when everything wasn‚Äôt sacred. When a supermarket wasn‚Äôt a minefield. When Starbucks was just another cafe. When I didn‚Äôt have to carry a thousand little altars to him in my head every day.

She constantly put herself under pressure to manage everything ‚Äî from picking the restaurant, calling the cab, choosing the mountain to hike, to even fetching the pizza. Not because she had to. But because she wanted to be part of everything. I get it now ‚Äî it‚Äôs not about control for her, it‚Äôs about her identity being tied to doing everything right. But it made her anxious, and that anxiety spread to everyone around her, including me.

At first, I admired her grit. But over time, I noticed how little space there was for me. She didn‚Äôt trust people to take care of simple things. If I cooked, she‚Äôd take over. If I parked the car, she‚Äôd jump in with directions. Even when I picked up coffee, she questioned the place I chose, and both were the same chain.

It was like I couldn‚Äôt get anything right, and eventually, I started questioning myself.

Only now do I realize this pattern is why her exes felt criticized. She never directly insulted me ‚Äî she didn‚Äôt need to. The constant ‚Äúfixing‚Äù made me feel incapable. I don‚Äôt think she did it on purpose. It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ how she operates. But that doesn't make it hurt less.

1kwk1ok,https://i.redd.it/m77szcknza3f1.jpeg,Any way to improve cooling?,"First time posting here. Excuse me if my etiquette is off; I mean no disrespect.
The TLDR is help me improve my room cooling with what I have.

I know adding a split would solve all my problems. I just can't justify the cost.
Any ideas will be appreciated.
I'll add metric and freedom units where I can. any miscalculations are my bad rounding.

I live in JPN. While not the tropics, it does get to 35C/95F with rh above 60% often enough in the summer
I have a WFH setup in my hall closet. total room volume is 5sqm/53sqft, exclude the volume taken by shelving, the usable floor space is only 0.8m/2.6ft wide, 2.5m/6'2ft long where I placed my 65cm/25inch wide desk in front of the window.
There is a small 30cm/1ft square window that tips outward for some ventilation, although I have most of it blocked off(more on that later)
maximum pivot is maybe 30degrees, so the opening is about 8cm/3inches max at the bottom of the window.

My hall closet doesn't have HVAC. It's fine 6months out of the year, unfun for 3, and unsuable for 3.
I bought a tiny/ineffective portable AC.
Siroca SYD-151(that white thing behind my pc), 160W, I know its a Toyota Corolla trying to compete in the Indy 500 in terms of power, but it runs off a standard mains power plug.
its max performance is 17C/62F cooling, dehumidify up to 4.4L/<1Gallon a day.
It's an all in one unit with the compressor/condenser inside, so it gets up to 54dB when running full power.

It has one heat exhaust tube that I vent out the window.
I have corrugated clear plastic over the window so the hot exhaust tube can be channeled outside without heat coming back into the room from the sides of the window opening. I've included a slit of space on the opposite side of the window to draw in air. I have covered the exhaust tube with insulation to try to keep the exhaust tube's heat from entering room. I also added a well sealed 8cm 2500rpm fan in between the exhaust tube to expedite the hot exhaust out the window. the exhaust tube is about 30cm/1ft long; I put the SYD151 as close to the window and the exhaust tube as straight as possible.
the SYD151's intakes are on both sides of the unit; there is no separate hose as an intake.
I have a separate hose to remove the dehumidified water. By the end of the work day, it will remove about 2L/<half gallon of water.

up til now this is just a commercial for the device...
I have 2 thermometers in the room. 1 in front of me by the window and another near the room's entrance. for the most part, both thermometers are in sync, although the one near the SYD151 is usually 1degree C/2ish F hotter due to its exhaust being near.

the cool air it blows is roughly the size of my face. the cold air travels only 30cm/1ft from the opening before diffusing
Running multiple experiments the best it does is, ""somewhat cool"" the room when I'm not in there when I take my lunch break, but I see the mercury climb up as I start the afternoon, and it is warmer and more humid than the non HVACed hallway by the end of my workday. apparently I am the biggest ""matrix"" heat and humidity source in the room.
I have 4 separate fans, a separate dehumidifier, for all the cost I spent adding them still wouldn't approach the cost of a split

It sounds like a server room with all the fans going, and the best it can do is remove humidity to about -10% of outside rh, temp is either on par or higher than the outside temperature. Yesterday mid day was 21C/70F,50%rh outside, in the room it was 28C/82F,41%rh. Didn't measure the hallway its connected to but it was probably 22-24C/71-75F. worst I've seen was 36C/97F,60%rh and the hallway was probably around 32C/89F.
I have the door sill packed with insulation to limit my voice going through the door(not great for circulation, I know)

any time I have a conference call, I need to turn off all but one fan because it's too noisy. needless to say it gets stuffy quick. Relative humidity goes up much faster than temp(that isn't very cool to begin with)

I used to be full WFH during the pandemic, but now I am only at home a few times a month.

other fruitless attempts I've done.
1. second dehumidifier. measurable decline in humidity, but negligible difference in comfort. raises room temp so only used on cold rainy days.
2. routing an AC intake to the window. MacGuyver'd a covering together to draw external air. no difference in temp or humidity, with or without it.
3. ice block cooler. ice water sealed in cooler box, pump circulating cold water to piping going over a fan. all it did was add humidity.
4. kilograms of desiccant packs. used in crawlspace home construction. no measurable difference.
5. ice packs with fans blowing over. room too warm, packs would dethaw before lunch, the pack ""sweat"" added humidity, not enough freezer space for multiple packs, little to no noticeable change in temp.
6. multistage fans within exhaust tube. no noticeable change in temps.
7. smoke/fog/tissues on a stick based airflow check. the fans do create good circulation of air with or without me in the room. but that only aids in evaporative cooling from me sweating.

I've looked into splits. its not an issue of the unit cost, more the costs associated with remodeling the room.
I don't have whole home HVAC, I have splits in the living rooms. those rooms came pre fabbed with holes in the wall for a split.
this is a hall closet and it isn't built with a hole in it. Getting one drilled open is easily USD$3,000.
and because of how the house is on the edge of the property line, I can't put the outside unit on the ground without encroaching into my neighbor's property, the exterior wall probably isn't built to support the weight of the outside blower, and my neighbor's balcony which is maybe 1m/3ft away probably could complain to the county if I put the external unit there.
The window itself is far too small for any window units available over here and besides, the window only pivots slightly so window units are out of the question.

I have given up and pretty much spend summer months in one of the air conned rooms, but this pocket office is the only one with a proper desk.
Working hunched over a coffee table on a soft couch aren't conducive to getting work done.

Hi everyone, 27M here,

Posting here because I need external opinions on something that happened between me and a girl I recently met. I apologize in advance for the long wall of text, there's a TLDR at the end for those of you who don't want to read everything. 

Here goes: I have had a history of keeping things to myself, especially in relationships, and it has proven to be the wrong strategy everytime (you dont say..). So, these past two years, even though I haven't been in any serious relationships romantically (I had two different sex friends) I did my best to always say whats on my mind and tell the truth to achieve better and healthier communication in general, be it in those aspects of my life or in friendships, at work etc... Yesterday though, I wonder if that strategy backfired:

I recently (3 weeks ago) have met this girl (25F) through a friend of mine, and we hit it off pretty quickly. We went out to a party and she straight up asked me if I wanted to kiss after 2 hours, I said yes and we spent the night hanging out, talking and making out. After that I thought it would be good to get to know each other in some other context than a party, so we went on two dates. We got coffee once and yesterday we went to the gym together. She then came back to my place and I made food. She ended up missing her bus and stayed for the night too (nothing sexual happened just to be clear).

I really enjoy her company, it seems mutual, and I feel like we are very compatible. The vibe got affectionate really quickly and it really is a pleasure to get to know her. I haven't considered starting anything serious romantically for a long time since I just hadn't met the right person and didn't consider myself ready, and though it is too early to say yet, I do have hopes that this is going to lead to something more serious and healthy. 

Now here is what happened that bothers me: yesterday night we were hanging on the couch and I asked if she ever wanted to have any kids. To me it is an important subject, as I recently realized that I really do want to have kids someday, and if we're gonna start anything serious eventually I wanted to know if we were on the same page (maybe a bit early to ask you might say, but it wasn't in a ""do you want to have kids with me in the next 6 months"" kind of way lol). She then returned the question and I told her that yes, some things made me realize that I did want kids at some point. When she asked what made me realize I hesitated to answer, but followed the rule that I set for myself of telling the truth. So I told her the truth, which is that 3 months ago, a girl I was casually seeing ended up being pregnant, and we decided to abort. When I had started seeing this girl girl it was agreed that it was just a casual thing and we also discussed what we would do in case something like this happened (thankfully, and not that I thought it would be needed because we used protection, but better be safe than sorry. Turns out it's always good to talk about stuff like this..)

After I explained what happened, she asked a few more questions like do I have any regrets and stuff like that (which I do not, I don't think it would have been right to have a kid come into this world from a relationship that is not aimed at building anything serious, we are both still studying, and I think we handled the situation in the best way we could have). I told her it made me grow up as a person and also that it made me think a lot about the subject of kids, hence the realization. We left it at that and she didn't say anything about it bothering her, but I did sense that it made her a bit uncomfortable. I also specified that I was not seeing anyone else while getting to know her and that if she had more questions, about this event or anything else, I would answer because I don't wwantto hide anything from her.

We then went to sleep and since this morning I have been wondering if I might have said too much, too soon. Do you think I fucked up by bringing up the subject this quickly? Is what happened to me (and the fact that it is very recent) a massive redflag? Should I bring up the subject again if I keep sensing discomfort on her part or should I let her do it?

I really do believe that truth is always better than hiding things but maybe I could have waited a bit longer to talk about it. I'm just scared that I might have made her too uncomfortable and that she won't tell me about it and just back away. I also dont want to bring up the subject again because I dont want to seem too needy or unconfident but I really would hate for that to ruin the chances of building a relationship with her, because I really like this person so far and would love to keep going further if the vibe continues to match. In the end, I do understand that no matter what I do or say this might just be a redflag for her and she is free to decide to stop things between us because of it, but it would definitely hurt and I can't stop thinking about it. 

What do you think I should do, people of reddit? 

Thank you very much for reading me if you've made it this far. Any advice or opinion is appreciated

TLDR; I told a girl I recently met and want to hopefully build a relationship with about the recent (3 months ago) accidental pregnancy (and abortion) of an ""ex sex-friend"", and I'm scared that this might make her too uncomfortable to want to continue seeing each other. Unsure if it was a good idea to tell her about it and undecisive about bringing up the subject again or let her come talk to me about it if she is indeed not comfortable with it

F30, Ontario Canada. Taking Cipralex and Wellbutrin.

\-November 2021: Had what I believe was a panic attack while driving. I was working a very stressful job at the time. I developed what I believe is brain fog and felt very detached from myself and surroundings. Almost like you are tipsy and feel lighter. 

\-December 2021: Thought it was mental health so started back on my meds.

\-March 2022: Still felt very groggy, distanced, detached, so my doctor suggested we up the dose.

\-Summer 2022: Mental health goes downhill. Still feeling the same as November.

\-2022-2024: Started seeing counsellors, doctors, trying to figure out what was wrong. Thought it could be DPDR, Long-COVID, anything. Tried different supplements (NAD+ assuming it was long-covid) along with antihistamines to reduce inflammation (from what I read, those help long-covid). During these years I mentally was able to push some of the fog away and become slightly more attached. Mental health started to get better and didn't feel as bad.

\-May 2024: counsellor and I decided to rule out if it was something wrong with my brain, so wrote a note to my doctor (at this time I had a new doctor) to see about an MRI. Since seeing my new doctor, he suggested several times it was just mental health issues, but reluctantly booked an appointment for an MRI this coming June.

\-Now: mental health is better, I have reduced caffeine intake (I wasn't always drinking coffee but was on and off during these last few years so didn't contribute it to anything). Noticed the past few months the brain fog has lifted further, mental health is better. Still slightly foggy, but a lot better. Memory has also improved. I imagine after 4 years, if it was my brain, I'd be worse or dead by now lol.

  
If I don't have to go to my MRI, of course I'd rather not, but my fear of cancelling would be there is actually something wrong with me. I want to say it's just mental health, but of course health anxiety says there could be something wrong.

I had to repeat some years at uni and was put in the year before me, where I befriended a transfer student who is ultra-sociable (let's call her G) and through her I befriended another one of our classmates, who is the main character of this story. Let's call him H. 

H comes from a remote farmers' village and has a very traditional upbringing. He also doesn't speak a word of English and had only really been friends with guys from his village up until he met us. He is also a pretty quiet guy and only ever minds his business. I introduced myself to him as my real name and a man, but I have my deadname on all my paperwork so he knew my deadname from roll call and knew the professors refer to me as a woman. I felt a little anxious about it but over the next two months after meeting him he never made a single comment about it so I decided to drop it... until our friend called me to tell me the following conversation.

I was absent that day because I was sick. G and H had gone out for coffee after class as we usually did and H told her he wanted to ask her something about me but wanted her to not tell me because he was afraid I could get sad. He said, ""I don't know anything about this LGBT stuff but u/iwillchangeiwill is some kind of trans, right? I can't tell from what to what, like he seems like a guy to me but the professors call him by a woman's name so I'm confused. Can you tell me what his deal is so I know how to support him?"" G explained to him what a trans man is and he was like, ""okay, cool, thank you"" and that was it. (She asked him for permission before telling me because she knew it would actually make me really happy to hear) 

Y'all I cry a little every time I remember this event. It's been a couple years since I met G and H and now they're two of my best friends, we met ad adults but I honestly feel like we grew up together anyway. But I just can't get over the fact that my friend could very easily be just like everybody else in my country and choose to stay in the dark about this new phenomenon in his life, but instead he asked because he wanted to help. Now that I know him better it doesn't surprise me at all because he's a great guy (and also really really funny) but back then I was just bewildered because I've met so many people and I never had anything like this happen before. 

My guy didn't even properly know the difference between gay and trans, he couldn't even Google it because there's nothing about trans people in our language out there, he spent two months having zero idea if this new classmate was a guy or a girl but he didn't care at ALL... he just knew he was down with me anyway. I still can't believe I've been recipient to such kindness and open mindedness. I swear nobody has a fucking excuse to be a dick. Also now I have the opposite problem, he forgets I'm trans and that's how the most painful arm wrestling match of my life happened lmao.

""Can you tell me what his deal is so I know how to support him?"" if I manage to retain my faith in humanity this sentence will be 60% of the reason. 

I hope every trans person ever finds friends like this and I hope the world keeps getting more people like H and G",27,1748341810.0,ftm,1,0.97,False

1kwjsmu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kwjsmu,latte art machine at home!,"hello!

does anyone know the best coffee machine for latte art at home? i recently had to leave my barista position and im a bit worried i will lose my skill. i have a bambino but i find the milk wand pressure to be poor and i really cannot steam any viable milk on it to pour anything.

i previously worked on a la marzocco strada av and definitely prefer the longer and straight steam wands, i was looking at la marzocco lineas but they seem a bit expensive for me. 

attatched latte art so you all know i am being REAL

Where you rank the different coffee bean offerings from roasters all across india. 

Would you be interested in seeing a leader board of sorts?
