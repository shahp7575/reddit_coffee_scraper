1kibmws,https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1kibmws/our_coffee_addiction_is_sucking_the_earth_dry/,Our coffee addiction is sucking the earth dry.,"I live in rural Vietnam. A major coffee producing area. This is my story about what's going on in our area. 


There are other crops like cashew, black pepper, durian, passion fruit and avocado. But coffee is the main one. 
Every season prices of some crop will go up, and farmers will chase that high price and start planting said crop. The last few years it has been durian, passion fruit and now coffee. 
This puts an immense strain on the farmers themselves, as they take out loans to replant their land.
But also on water. Every day I hear the well drilling rig from a different direction, it's an unmistakable sound. Wells are going deeper and deeper, because the older wells are running dry. Lakes and ponds are pumped dry to irrigate the newly planted crops. 
To make matters worse, climate change results in the area getting less and less rain. With the last El Nino being the driest on record for our area. 
Yet there seems to be no stopping anyone from pumping more, drilling deeper. 
People who used to rely on a manually dug well of about 15 meters for their livelihoods are now forced to buy water at a day's wage per thousand liters.
Yet the coffee farmers pump more, because the price is high. They invest more in their land, with everyone getting their own well, in stead of sharing. 

My guess is that coffee prices will keep increasing because of climate change disruptions in weather patterns. That would mean more and more, deeper and deeper wells. Until there's truly nothing left in the ground. 

Durian is a tree that needs year round babying in our climate. It needs much more water than nature provides here, even without climate change effects. 
Yet it's planted everywhere. Nurseries are a third coffee, a third durian and a collection of other crops in the last third.

How are we not running into a wall? This can't keep going like this.

Blood.  
  
It was everywhere.   
  
In her hands, in between her toes, in her hair. It was everywhere! Why‚Ä¶ Whose blood is this? And why was she standing in it? Why was she f\*\*\*\*\*g covered in it?!   
  
And all of a sudden, the scene changes and her family is here, covered in their own blood, getting killed.   
  
‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Calista screamed, reaching out for them but the floor vanished from under her and she was falling‚Ä¶ falling‚Ä¶  
  
Calista woke up with a start, her heart pounding hard against her rib, every single inch of her body covered in sweat. Her room was silent, the only sound was her harsh breathing.   
  
She blinked slowly, her eyes taking time to adjust to the darkness before she looked over at her clock. It was barely five and she was now awake.   
  
She knew she wouldn't be going back to sleep.   
  
She sighed deeply as she rubbed her trembling hand on her face, pushing her wet hair away.   
  
It was going to be a long day.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
The bright overhead lights buzzed faintly, casting a harsh glare on the blood-soaked sheets beneath her hands. The smell of antiseptic mixed with the thick, metallic scent of freshly spilled blood was heavy on the nose‚Äîso much blood.   
  
Her mind flashed back to a different scene with so much blood, screams. But she blinked that away. This wasn't the time to be thinking about that. She needed her hands straight, her head clear.   
  
Calista‚Äôs hands were steady but her heart was hammering hard in her chest. She barely noticed the surgical mask pressing against her nose or the sweat gathering beneath the gloves clinging to her skin.   
  
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs crashing!‚Äù someone yelled, panic heavy in their voice.   
  
She ignored the panic in their voice, focusing instead on the deep, gaping wound in the man‚Äôs abdomen. The bullet wound had torn through muscle and lodged itself dangerously close to his liver. If she didn't get it out he was as good as dead.   
  
‚ÄúScalpel,‚Äù she ordered, her voice calm, even though she also wanted to panic. But she couldn't. The man‚Äôs life depended on her remaining calm.   
  
A trembling hand passed it to her. She wanted to scowl at them. She didn't have the damn time for fear.   
  
Her movements were quick, memorized, and precise. A small incision. A delicate probe. There! The bullet. Her breath hitched. It was deeper than she expected, wedged tight, but she couldn't hesitate. Not now. Carefully, she reached in with a forceps‚Äî  
  
Bang!  
  
The doors to the operating room open.   
  
Calista‚Äôs head snapped up, a sharp reprimand on her tongue, but the words died on her tongue when she saw them‚Äîmen in black suits, guns at their sides, their eyes cold and empty.   
  
Her heart dropped to her stomach.   
  
What the hell?  
  
The men parted and one man with blonde hair stepped forward, his hard eyes fixed on Caliste. He had that air of anger around him, the quiet hum of danger surrounding him like a dark cloud, a black omen. ‚ÄúMiss Calloway,‚Äù he addressed her, his voice smooth. ‚ÄúDo you know who you're operating on?‚Äù   
  
Calista has always been quick to anger, always quick to snap. It was one of her many flaws, one of the things that made her a loner and bitter. Because people were so damn annoying, and nosy, and she was quick to lash out. And now she was damn close to snapping but she kept her mouth shut and glared at the man, her heart racing.   
  
‚ÄúI wouldn't bother with names,‚Äù the man continued, his expression blank. ‚ÄúAll you have to know is that you shouldn't let him die.‚Äù  
  
Calista wanted to throw her head back and laugh, and she also wanted to stab the man with the forceps still in her hand. Who the hell were these people?   
  
‚ÄúDo you think threatening me is going to make him miraculously live if he's meant to die?‚Äù she snapped, her voice muffled by the nose mask, but that didn't dull the sharpness in her voice.   
  
She was scared. Goddamn it, she was f\*\*\*\*\*g scared and she fought to keep her hand steady. But she was also angry. And the anger suppressed the fear. It was better rage than fear.   
  
The man‚Äôs eyes flashed with something dangerous before it cleared and he opened his mouth to probably spit more threats but Calista didn't give him the chance.   
  
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the one currently endangering his life, mister,‚Äù she told him, trying to keep her voice calm, but she didn't stop glaring at him. ‚ÄúWith every minute you spend here, throwing unnecessary threats, you're delaying me and his life is being more at risk. Get out.‚Äù   
  
The man eyed her, his jaw clenched tight, before he made a motion with two of his fingers and the men cleared out just as suddenly as they came, the man‚Äôs eyes lingering on her far too long for her taste.   
  
Once the door closed behind them, the room seemed to release the breath they'd been holding and Calista‚Äôs hands shook a little, regret twisting her insides.   
  
She should have kept her mouth shut, for goodness sake. Why did her mouth always have to go running before her brain? These people were bad news. She knew this wouldn't be the end.   
  
She looked down at her patient‚Äôs face, searching her brain to see if she would know him. She didn't. He had an unforgettable face, so she knew she wouldn't have seen him before.   
  
She didn't care about who he was. She just hoped this was the last time she would see his face.   
  
\*\*\*  
  
A WEEK LATER  
  
Calista sighed as she stepped into her apartment, inhaling the warm and inviting smell of her home.   
  
‚ÄúHi, baby,‚Äù she said to her house. ‚ÄúMissed me? Because I sure as hell missed you.‚Äù   
  
Talking to herself or objects around her was one habit she had never outgrown. Well, that and her deep pit of rage. That rage had been with her for as long as she could remember. And it only increased when her‚Äì  
  
She immediately felt something was wrong when she stepped deeper into her apartment. The hair at the back of her neck stood up, a chill sense of dread wrapped its icy fingers around her spine.   
  
She felt eyes on her.  
  
Her trembling hand reached for the light switch and she turned it on. Her heart dropped to her toes when she saw who was sitting in her living room, legs crossed as if he owned the place.   
  
She knew it. She goddamn knew that wouldn't be the last time she saw his face.   
  
He stood up, straightening to his full height until he was towering over her and she felt tiny.   
  
‚ÄúHello, Miss Calloway.‚Äù  
  


# Dislike For The Doctor

SIX DAYS AGO  
  
‚ÄúThe Russian has been quiet,‚Äù Aaron informed Jaxon, sitting on the chair close to the hospital bed, his leg crossed and a tablet in front of his nose. ‚ÄúWe haven't heard a single thing from them since that night.‚Äù  
  
Jaxon hummed but said nothing. He was trying to pay attention to what Aaron was saying and he was failing. He should be listening, only that he felt‚Ä¶ irritated.   
  
He was sick of just sitting in a hospital bed all day and simply doing nothing. He couldn't even stand up and pace around the room, for God‚Äôs sake.   
  
Aaron was always quick to tell him when he complained that he almost died. ‚ÄúThe doctor said you need a lot of rest. So stay down, Jaxon, and f\*\*\*\*\*g rest.‚Äù  
  
Jaxon was close to throwing a tantrum like a f\*\*\*\*\*g child.   
  
His muscles were stiff and aching. He needed to be up and moving around, not sitting still while everyone did everything for him. There was a war going on and he should be at the front.   
  
And even though Aaron told him the Russians were lying low, he still couldn't relax.   
  
‚ÄúAre you listening to me, Jaxon?‚Äù Aaron asked, a hint of irritation in his voice.   
  
‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Jaxon answered curtly and looked at the TV, even though he wasn't seeing anything.   
  
He ignored Aaron‚Äôs heavy sigh and just fell back into his head, lost in the depth of his mind, that was until the door opened, and his world stepped into the room.  
  
‚ÄúHermano,‚Äù she cried as she ran to him, and he opened his arms for her. She hugged him tightly, and he winced from the pain that shot through his abdomen, but he didn't release his hold on her.   
  
‚ÄúMi amor,‚Äù he whispered, holding her tightly and burying his nose in her hair, inhaling her soothing scent.   
  
‚ÄúYou.‚Äù She pulled away from him, sniffing as she hit him in the chest. ‚ÄúWhat were you thinking? Getting shot?‚Äù  
  
His lips curled into a soft smile, a smile only meant for her. ‚ÄúForgive me, mi amor. I shall tell the Russians next time not to shoot me. That I have a little sister that might die if I die.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúDamn right.‚Äù She glared at him for a short moment before she hugged him again. ‚ÄúI was so scared,‚Äù she whispered, her voice trembling. ‚ÄúI was so, so scared when Aaron told me.‚Äù   
  
Jaxon shot Aaron a look behind Aelina‚Äôs shoulder, and the bastard shrugged, his eyes falling back to his tablet. Jaxon was going to have a word with him later.   
  
‚ÄúYou shouldn't be,‚Äù he said softly as he stroked her hair. ‚ÄúDeath wouldn't be able to take me away from you.‚Äù  
  
She was his life, his goddamn everything.   
  
They weren't related in any way. Not at all. But she was still his family.   
  
He had found her on the streets, fifteen years ago, tiny and starving. But despite how she looked, there was still a fire in her eyes, a fire that never burned out through out. He had been young himself, then, but he carried her in his arms, and she had been the bane of his existence since then.   
  
Aelina pulled away from him and immediately lunged into talks of school. Jaxon listened intently, nodding, and saying a word or two. Aaron got up and left, saying he was going to get lunch.   
  
Ten minutes later, he came back with his eyebrows set, and no lunch.   
  
‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù Jaxon asked, immediately tensed, alert.   
  
Aaron sat back on his chair, crossing his arms, looking Jaxon dead in the eyes as he said, ‚ÄúI don't like your doctor.‚Äù  
  
Jaxon blinked at him, his eyebrows furrowed. ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúShe‚Äôs disrespectful.‚Äù  
  
Aelina rolled her eyes at him. ‚ÄúLet me guess, she didn't cower at your mighty presence?‚Äù  
  
Aaron shot her a glance but said nothing.   
  
Jaxon groaned. ‚ÄúThat's why you're sulking?‚Äù  
  
Aaron gave him a look that could make his balls wither and die. ‚ÄúI am not sulking.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúSure,‚Äù Aelina said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre only pouting.‚Äù  
  
Aaron stuck out his tongue at her.   
  
A short laugh burst from Jaxon. Aaron was his commander. He ruled their empire when Jaxon wasn't there. He was feared, respected, and could be brutal when he wanted. And he could also be cute when he wanted. Though he might probably stab Jaxon in the balls if he called him cute.   
  
‚ÄúAnyways, dislike aside,‚Äù Aaron said, his expression now serious, ‚ÄúI think she's the one we‚Äôre looking for.‚Äù  
  
Jaxon raised an eyebrow.   
  
‚ÄúA doctor,‚Äù Aaron answered the unasked question.   
  
‚ÄúAhh.‚Äù Jaxon nodded.   
  
They needed a doctor in their outfit. Someone they could trust, someone they could let into their circle. Someone who could treat them on the call and ready. Jaxon being at this hospital had raised too many eyebrows. He didn't want the public‚Äôs eyes on him.   
  
That attention wouldn't have happened if they had their own doctor. They had one but he was killed. This war with the Russians had taken too much. From both sides.   
  
In this last fight with them, Jaxon and his men were able to take a lot of them down before they managed to put a bullet in him. So they were probably regrouping, licking their wounds while they prepared for the next fight.   
  
Jaxon wanted to hit them now that they were weak, but he had also taken a big blow to his side.   
  
Back to the doctor‚Ä¶  
  
‚ÄúWhy do you think she could do it?‚Äù Jaxon asked Aaron. ‚ÄúOur world isn't for just anyone, Aaron. You can't just see someone and decide they were fit for a life of blood and violence. That is not how things are done.‚Äù Aelina nodded as he spoke, sitting beside him on the bed and interlocking their fingers.  
  
Their last doctor was born into their world, he knew everything about it and how to survive in it. Their world wasn't for the faint-hearted. It was cruel and brutal. That was why he tried as hard as possible to keep Aelina shielded from it all.   
  
Since he took her under his wing, she has never stayed in Spain for more than a month. He spent her off to England, where she would be safe and could study.   
  
A life with him was dangerous. That was why he never took lovers. Despite how much he craved‚Ä¶  
  
‚ÄúI know she can be our next doctor,‚Äù Aaron answered, his jaw set in determination. ‚ÄúIt's all in her eyes, Jaxon. She has seen things, been through hell and back. She's tough. Back at the operation room, she looked me dead in the eyes and told me to get out.‚Äù  
  
Jaxon still didn't understand why Aaron would burst into the operating room and threaten the doctor. He had defended himself by saying, ‚ÄúShe could be working with those bastard Russians. So I had to go remind her what would happen if she tried to mess with you. That is if she was working with the Russians.‚Äù  
  
That had made sense, but still.   
  
‚ÄúShe‚Äôs got steel, Jaxon,‚Äù Aaron continued. ‚ÄúI know it.‚Äù   
  
Jaxon was silent for a while, thinking about it. If his commander said she could do it, then she could.   
  
‚ÄúI assume you already have her file?‚Äù  
  
Aaron smiled as he handed him his tablet. ‚ÄúOf course I do.‚Äù   
  


# The Past Was In The Past

Calista stared at the man, her heart racing, her eyes still wide. She was supposed to be panicking, screaming, demanding what the hell he was doing at her house, but her mind was taking time to get there, to realize it was in danger, sluggish with shock.   
  
It would catch up. It always did. It just needed a push.   
  
‚ÄúMiss Calloway,‚Äù the stranger called again, and this time he took a step towards her.   
  
And that was the push her mind needed. The fear slammed into her all at once.   
  
She took a step back, her hands trembling. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt‚Ä¶ don't‚Ä¶ Who are you? What are you doing in my house? Get out!‚Äù  
  
She kept taking a step back, walking towards the door without alerting him. She just needed to leave here, then she would run as fast as her legs could carry her, and she would call the police. But a little voice at the back of her head told her this man wouldn't be threatened by the police, that the police were probably in his pocket.   
  
She told that voice to shut the hell up.   
  
The man raised his hands in the universal gesture of surrender, his expression calm, much to Calista distaste. ‚ÄúI apologize for intruding into your home like this,‚Äù he said, his voice deep, and oddly‚Ä¶ soothing. No, Calista, nothing was soothing about this intruder‚Äôs voice. ‚ÄúI just wanted to talk.‚Äù  
  
She narrowed her eyes, her back hitting the door, her fingers scrambling for the handle. Locked. Damn it, the door was locked!   
  
Oh God. No. No, no, no‚Äì  
  
‚ÄúWhy couldn't you book an appointment or call as a normal person would?‚Äù she snapped, her voice cracking.   
  
The corner of his lips lifted in a smile, his hands still up. ‚ÄúI'm not a normal person.‚Äù  
  
Her heart beat harder against her chest. She told herself it was from fear, not because of his damn smile. ‚ÄúDamn right you're not.‚Äù   
  
She knew what kind of person he was, what he did. The men in black? A bullet wound? It was so obvious. This time Calista‚Äôs heart was racing fast from fear. She knew what he did, she knew he was from the mafia. Maybe a leader. From the way he spoke, stood, that air of power around him. It was all so damn obvious.   
  
She wanted nothing to do with these people. They were part of a life she had buried so deep, she barely remembered it‚Äîexcept in her nightmares. But now, those nightmares were slipping into reality.   
  
Oh, now she was finally panicking.   
  
She threw her bag on the floor, turned to the door, and unlocked it, her hands trembling badly, it was a struggle before she finally got the door open.   
  
She was weak in the knees, fear making her dizzy, but she forced her body to run, she forced her voice to scream for help. ‚ÄúHelp!‚Äù Louder, Calista. Scream louder.   
  
She ran through her apartment building, screaming, tears streaming down her face.   
  
Her past was in the past. It should stay there.   
  
Her bare feet pounded against the hallway floor. Doors creaked open. Faces peered out, confused and startled. A tall, big man she had seen once or twice came out and she ran straight to him.   
  
‚ÄúPl-please, help me,‚Äù she cried, holding the man‚Äôs hand in her trembling one.   
  
The man looked at her with worried eyes, letting her hold his hand. ‚ÄúWhat's wrong?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúThere-‚Äù She inhaled to get herself together. ‚ÄúThere is a man in my apartment. A stranger. Please help me.‚Äù   
  
The man‚Äôs expression darkened. He carefully peeled Calista‚Äôs hand from his and went inside his apartment. Calista swayed, dizzy with panic. Oh God, he left. He wasn't going to‚Äì  
  
Then he came back. Holding a knife. A big one. He jerked his head towards her apartment. ‚ÄúCome on.‚Äù   
  
Calista sniffed as she led him towards her apartment, staying glued to his side. They got to her apartment. Her door was still wide open, the contents of her bag still sprawled on the floor. And the man? Gone. No one was in her apartment.   
  
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no one here,‚Äù the man informed her after he searched everywhere.   
  
She inhaled a shaky breath, her shoulders shaking with it as she leaned against the wall, rubbing her hand aggressively on her face.   
  
‚ÄúDo you need me to call the police?‚Äù the neighbor asked gently, standing a small distance away from her.   
  
She should. But it was useless.   
  
The police wouldn't help. Because men like him didn't fear the law.   
  
She raised her head and managed a strained smile. ‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶ no, thank you. I'll call them. Maybe.‚Äù   
  
That was a lie, of course.   
  
She thanked the man and he left, but she didn't just stay there and wait for the stranger to come back. She picked up her phone, her purse, and her car keys. There was no way in hell she was staying here.   
  
\*\*\*  
  
Calista stayed in a hotel for two nights. She didn't even go back to her apartment for a change of clothes. She bought the clothes she was wearing.   
  
She was scared beyond relief. God, she was so scared. What did the stranger want from her? Did he want to punish her for speaking to that man in the operating room rudely? Did he want to threaten her?   
  
Or‚Ä¶ God, or did he know who she was?   
  
A violent shiver passed through her as she stepped inside her office, closing the door behind her.   
  
Had she‚Ä¶ had she slipped and given herself away? She‚Ä¶ she couldn't. She was careful. So damn careful.   
  
She sat down behind her desk, dropping her bag. She picked up her coffee and drank it down in one go. She still felt like s\*\*t.   
  
Thank goodness she didn't have any operations for this week. Goodness knows what she might do during the operation.   
  
A gentle knock came at her door and Cynthia opened the door and stepped inside, a small smile on her face.   
  
‚ÄúDr. Calloway, your patient is here to see you,‚Äù Cynthia informed her.   
  
‚ÄúMy patient?‚Äù Calista asked, a confused look on her face.   
  
Cynthia nodded. ‚ÄúMr. Jaxon Castillo booked an apartment with you yesterday. You approved of it, ma'am.‚Äù  
  
She had? And who was Jaxon Castillo? Calista didn't always remember the names of her patients. What? There were a lot. Her brain might melt if she starts trying to remember their names.   
  
And she didn't want to ask Cynthia who that was. Cynthia was already giving her that ‚Äòlook.‚Äô That look that says she knew something was going on with Calista and she was beginning to worry. Calista hated that look.   
  
Cynthia might be her assistant but Calista still liked to keep her life private, tight lid, that not even air could enter. She might have been working in this hospital for five years, but no one knew anything about her. That was how Calista liked to live.   
  
So she gave Cynthia a tight smile as she said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll see him now.‚Äù  
  
Cynthia nodded and left.   
  
Calista sighed, slumping back on her chair and pressing her index finger against her temple. She was tired, physically and mentally. She needed a break.   
  
Maybe she could take a week off. Since the five years she started working she could count the number of times she had taken leave on one hand.   
  
Yes, you could call her a work freak.   
  
Work was the glue keeping her together. And it felt like some kind of link to her father. He had wanted to be a doctor, but the life he was born into didn't allow that. But she could. So she was doing this for her father.   
  
A knock came at her door and Calista was immediately on her feet, slapping her fake smile on to greet her patient.   
  
But that smile turned sour when she saw who it was.   
  


# Choices And Consequences

Oh no. Oh no, no, no‚Äì  
  
He was here again.   
  
He was goddamn here again!   
  
This time Calista‚Äôs brain didn't need any push to go into a panic mood. The panic was instant, crushing. She opened her mouth to scream for Cynthia but the man‚ÄìJaxon spoke before her.   
  
‚ÄúCalm down, Miss Calloway,‚Äù he said calmly, but unlike that night, there was an edge to his voice. ‚ÄúYou asked me to book an appointment like a normal person and here I am. I won't harm you in your office, where anyone could just enter. That will be stupid.‚Äù  
  
True. That was true. Calista‚Äôs panicked brain just needed to understand that. He couldn't hurt her. Yeah. He couldn't.   
  
Her breathing slowed, and the tension in her body ever so slowly started to melt away. But she didn't sit. She didn't relax. She remained standing, watching like a prey watching its predator.   
  
‚ÄúWould you mind if I sit?‚Äù he asked gently, gesturing towards the chair in front of her desk.   
  
It was better than standing. He was intimidating when he was standing, tall, and packed with muscles, he was the definition of a predator. ‚ÄúBy all means.‚Äù She pointed at the chair.   
  
He sat down slowly, adjusting his suit, and giving her a small smile. He looked up at her while she looked down her nose, but that changed nothing about who held the power. Even sitting, he still looked like a crime god.   
  
With his three-piece suit, tailored to perfection to match him like a second skin, his jet black perfectly styled back and some falling into his eyes, and his eyes‚Äîthose damn eyes‚Äîblack, like a void, yet they were‚Ä¶ soft. Soft, not hard, and empty like how it was supposed to be.   
  
His eyes made him look‚Ä¶ kind. But Calista wouldn't be fooled by looks. It has long since been established that looks could be madly deceiving. So she wasn't falling for his eyes, even as they continued to stare at her in that not-so-uncomfortable way he was doing now.   
  
‚ÄúI want to apologize for that night,‚Äù he began, his deep voice soft. ‚ÄúI shouldn't have just entered your home uninvited. I should have approached you like how a normal person would. And for that, I‚Äôm sorry. Deeply. I'm embarrassed by my actions.‚Äù  
  
And he did look embarrassed. There was a slight pink color in his eyes, barely noticeable in his tanned skin, but it was there, alright.   
  
Calista slowly sat down, her eyes never leaving his. His eyes brightened as he watched her relax. Goodness, was she wrong about him? Wasn't he a part of the mafia? He had the looks, had the aura, but‚Ä¶ those black, bottomless eyes. They were so expressive. You could see his soul through them.   
  
She inhaled as she looked into his eyes and said, ‚ÄúNow that we've passed the point of you trying to kill me with a heart attack, what do you want from me, Mr. Castillo?‚Äù  
  
Castillo‚Äôs smile didn't waver. If anything, it only sharpened, a flicker of something amused‚Äîpleased‚Äîcrossing his features.   
  
‚ÄúStraight to the point,‚Äù he murmured. ‚ÄúI admire that.‚Äù  
  
He leaned forward, resting his forearms on the desk between them. It was subtle, but the movement shifted the air, shrinking the space between them, forcing her to remain right there, under his unwavering gaze.   
  
‚ÄúI need a doctor, Miss Calloway,‚Äù he said.   
  
Calista blinked. ‚ÄúA doctor?‚Äù   
  
‚ÄúYou,‚Äù he clarified softly. ‚ÄúYour skills. Your hands.‚Äù  
  
Something in his voice made her chest tighten. It wasn't a request‚Äîit was a decision he already made.   
  
Calista straightens, fighting the urge to recoil. ‚ÄúI work at a hospital, as you already know, Mr. Castillo. If you need medical attention, there are plenty of places you can go to.‚Äù  
  
A quiet sigh left him, as if he expected her to say that. ‚ÄúYou misunderstand,‚Äù he murmured. ‚ÄúI can't go to the hospital. My people can't. My men brought me here because they had no other chance.‚Äù   
  
Calista‚Äôs fingers curled slightly on her desk. ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù  
  
She already knew why. But he didn't need to know that she knew. The less he knew about the things she knew, the better.   
  
He studied her for a moment, his gaze steady. Then, finally, he spoke, his voice as smooth as velvet, ‚ÄúBecause I am at war, Miss Calloway.‚Äù  
  
Thump.   
  
Thump.   
  
Thump.   
  
She tried to maintain that steady beat of her heart, she tried to school her expression to remain calm.  
  
‚ÄúWar?‚Äù The word left a foul taste in her mouth.   
  
He nodded, slow and deliberate. ‚ÄúIt's not something you need to bother yourself with. But what you need to know is this‚ÄîI have men who are hurt, men who will continue to get hurt. And I need someone I can trust to take care of them. Taking them to the hospital will attract attention we do not need.‚Äù  
  
Trust. Coming from a man she had only just met. Coming from a don. Since when did dons trust anyone but themselves?   
  
Calista wet her dry lips and Castillo‚Äôs eyes dropped to them before he looked back at her eyes sharply. ‚ÄúYou trust me?‚Äù she asked, skeptical lacing her voice.   
  
‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he answered honestly without missing a beat. ‚ÄúBut I'm willing to trust you.‚Äù  
  
Calista inhaled sharply, suddenly dizzy.   
  
Trust. Trust. Trust.   
  
That word was dangerous, a double-edged sword. It could be the best thing when someone trusts you, and it could be the worst thing ever. Knowing you had someone to trust was comforting, and it also hurt more than anything when that trust was broken.  
  
She had never experienced something like that before, but her father had. He had someone break his trust so badly, it had left him broken. It had left all of them broken. And dead. Her family died in the flesh, while she was dead on the inside.   
  
Calista blinked, her eyes going wide when she felt tears on her lashes. She was on the verge of tears and Castillo was watching her, his eyes slightly narrowed. She turned away from him, blinking rapidly, clearing her throat.   
  
‚ÄúI'm not sure I'm the first person for this,‚Äù she said and cleared her throat again when her voice came out hoarse.   
  
Castillo smiled gently. ‚ÄúYou are.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúHow do you know?‚Äù  
  
His eyes softened. ‚ÄúIt's all in your eyes, Calista.‚Äù  
  
Calista didn't know what he meant by that, and she didn't want to know. But what she wanted to know was why the sound of her name on his lips, the way he said each syllabus with such care, made something in her chest tighten.   
  
‚ÄúI don't want to force you into anything, Miss Calloway,‚Äù Castillo said after a moment, his voice gentle, careful. ‚ÄúI simply want you to consider it.‚Äù   
  
That was almost worse than an outright demand. Because now, the choice‚Äîand the consequences‚Äîwere her decision to make. And they have already established‚Äîthey, as in the demons in her head‚Äîthat she was terrible at making decisions.   
  
And something tells her if she said no‚Äîtruly refused‚Äîhe wouldn't push. He wouldn't threaten. He would simply leave.   
  
She met his gaze one last time, not even bothering with a fake smile. ‚ÄúHave a nice day, Mr. Castillo.‚Äù   
  
There. She made a decision. And in record time also.   
  


# Blood Stain Everywhere

THREE DAYS LATER  
  
Drip.  
  
Drip.  
  
Drip.   
  
Calista watched as each drop of water from the tap fell into the sink, its drip sound a dull resonance in her mind.   
  
The numbness was spreading, but it wasn't fast enough for her. A tingling sensation still buzzed within her skin, her ears were ringing, and her heart was beating mercilessly against its cage.   
  
Drip.  
  
Drip.  
  
Drip.   
  
Will it ever get easier? Will the pain ever be dull to handle? Would she always feel this sensation under her skin whenever she operated on someone?   
  
God, she couldn't.   
  
She would go crazy. She would peel her own skin off just to be rid of that buzzing. She would rip her own heart out just so she couldn't feel again.   
  
She hadn't been able to save a life today.  A girl that had so much life in front of her. But that life has slipped past Calista‚Äôs fingers today. She could do nothing but watch as the girl's heart stopped beating. She could do nothing when the girl's mother flung herself to the ground and wept.   
  
She could still hear the woman screaming and begging them to tell her it was a lie and that her daughter was still alive.   
  
Calista had been tempted to tell her just so she could stop hearing the woman's cries.   
  
But that would be cruel, and Calista was not cruel, no matter how she wished she was. Because if she was cruel, then she wouldn't feel like this. She wouldn't feel like she was falling apart, only hanging by a thin thread just because she couldn't save a life today.   
  
She was no god. She tried to save people from what she knew, it wasn't her fault if they died. She shouldn't blame herself so much. But yet she does.   
  
The brown eyes at the mirror turned glassy, then a tear slipped through, then another.  
  
Goddamn it!   
  
Why wasn't she numb yet? Why was she still feeling? She‚Ä¶ she didn't want to feel. Goddamn it, she didn't want to feel. Because she might go crazy, or she might be eaten alive by feelings.   
  
Calista felt everything to an extreme. That was her blessing and that was her curse. When she was happy, she was happy to the fullest. When she was angry, sad‚Ä¶  
  
Her hands that were placed on top of the sink shook, her eyes in the mirror turning red. She closed her eyes because she couldn't bear the haunted look in those eyes.   
  
She couldn't.   
  
She bit her tongue to keep the sobs that wanted to burst out in. It wasn't her fault.   
  
‚ÄúIt wasn't my fault,‚Äù she whispered out loud as if it would convince her heart, her head. Her voice was hoarse, broken. And the sob almost burst out but she hit her tongue harder, tasting iron.   
  
The pain seemed to ground her and the fog behind her eyelids began to clear.   
  
It wasn't her fault.   
  
\*\*\*  
  
Calista decided to walk home. She had gone back to her house since that day with Jaxon. She knew he would leave her alone. And truly, he did. She hasn't seen him since that day. She didn't know why that made her heart heavy with disappointment when she had refused his offer.   
  
She wanted to see those eyes, those very expressive eyes. But she wouldn't, because she being close to him meant she would be close to his life. She wouldn't want to touch that with a fifty-foot-long pole.  
  
She sighed, her legs suddenly too heavy.   
  
She could still hear the mother‚Äôs scream. In the silence that followed after the heart monitor flatline.   
  
She wanted to reach home where she would curl up in her bed then sleep, or maybe cry. Crying will be‚Äì  
  
Calista froze on her steps.   
  
Something was terribly, terribly wrong.   
  
The streets were too quiet. Even though it was late, it shouldn't be this quiet. Calista has walked this road countless times and this was the first time the street has been too‚Ä¶ still.   
  
Her pulse quickened as unease curled around her ribs, the hair at the back of her neck standing on end.   
  
Oh, something was definitely wrong.   
  
She was just readying herself to run when a sharp sound cut through the air. Gunshots.   
  
Every single cell in Calista‚Äôs blood shut down and she went completely still, and a sweat broke out on her body even though the evening air was cool. She wasn't even breathing. She was..  She was having a panic attack. But unlike the other people who screamed and sobbed when they had panic attacks, Calista just stood still, her breath a harsh panting.   
  
The gunshots went off again and this time, shouts followed. Calista flinched, finally snapping out of her stillness, but she still didn't move, couldn't run.   
  
Blood.   
  
Oh God, there was blood everywhere. Her white gown was stained with it. It was on her hands, everywhere. A strangled sob burst out of her as she tried to remove the blood from her hands.   
  
‚ÄúIt wouldn't come off.‚Äù Her voice sounded rough and it sounded like she was talking underwater. ‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt come off!‚Äù  
  
She heard screams and she flinched, her entire body feeling like electricity was passing through it.  
  
Screams.   
  
Screams.  
  
Screams.   
  
She blinked‚Äì  
  
Her father, kneeling, blood dripping down his temple. Her siblings, their tiny hands clawing at the men holding them. A gun. Pressed cold to her father‚Äôs head.   
  
Calista screamed, lunging for her family but strong hands held her back.   
  
She screamed and fought against them, trying to get to her family. She had to‚Ä¶ She‚Ä¶ She had‚Ä¶  
  
They were going to die and she was going to watch. She couldn't. It was better to die with them.   
  
She fought harder but the hands around her didn't relent.  
  
‚ÄúCalista!‚Äù  
  
She fought harder, thrashing, screaming, acting like a woman possessed. She had to get to them. She wanted to die with them.   
  
‚ÄúCalista, snap out of it!‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúNo!‚Äù she screamed back. ‚ÄúLet me go!‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúCalista, it's Jaxon!‚Äù  
  
Huh? Jaxon? How‚Ä¶  
  
She blinked the tears away in her eyes and the streets came back into focus. She looked down at her gown and there‚Ä¶ there was no blood. She trembled, a sob bursting out of her, loud and ugly.   
  
She thought she was getting better. She thought she had been healing. But she just kept relapsing. Her stupid therapist had told her she needed time, but how much time did she need? It has been ten years, goddamn it!   
  
She cursed Felicia whenever she was for giving her false hope that she would heal.   
  
‚ÄúHey,‚Äù a voice said calmly behind her and she froze. That was when she realized that there were hands around her and her back was pressed against a hard chest. ‚ÄúIt's Jaxon,‚Äù the voice whispered, releasing her gently.   
  
She staggered forward when he released her, and Jaxon was there to steady her.   
  
She blinked up at him, and her eyes landed on black eyes. It was really him.  
  
‚ÄúJaxon?‚Äù Her voice sounded hoarse like she had been screaming.   
  
Right.  
  
She had.  
  
‚ÄúWe need to get out of here,‚Äù Jaxon said softly, but his features were hard.

Nyqxee‚Äôs eyes are a shade of blue unlike any other, a deep, almost ethereal cerulean, with flecks of silver that shimmer like moonlight on water. A color that should have marked her as special, yet only made her stand out in a world that wanted her invisible.  
  
She had always been different, but she never imagined that difference would lead to her downfall.  
  
Even before her first shift, she had felt the weight of being an outsider. The wary glances, the hushed whispers, the way her parents‚Äô hands stiffened when she reached for them. Other pups played freely, forming bonds that would last lifetimes, but Nyqxee had always been alone. The pack, the very people meant to protect and nurture her, treated her as though she were something unnatural, something to be tolerated rather than cherished.  
  
She would often find herself lingering at the edges of gatherings, watching as the others laughed and played. When she was younger, she had tried to join in, to pretend that the distance between her and them was only in her mind. But no matter how hard she tried, the gap never closed. They always found an excuse to leave her behind.  
  
Her parents, proud warriors of the pack, had never spoken the words aloud, but she saw the disappointment in their eyes. They had done their duty, raising her, feeding her, ensuring she was strong. But love? Warmth? Acceptance? Those were things Nyqxee had only ever dreamed of.  
  
She told herself that it would all change when she shifted. That when she felt her wolf rise inside her, when she finally became what she was meant to be, the pack would see her differently. That they would have no choice but to acknowledge her as one of them.  
  
The night of her first shift should have been a celebration. Sixteen years old, finally stepping into her birthright as a werewolf, finally feeling her wolf beneath her skin. But instead, it became a nightmare.  
  
The moon hung low in the midnight sky, casting silver shadows upon the forest. The wind whispered through the trees, carrying with it the scent of pine and something darker, something foreboding.  
  
Nyqxee ran.  
  
Her legs burned with exhaustion, her lungs ached, but she didn‚Äôt dare stop. The icy ground beneath her feet blurred as she pushed forward, desperate to escape the horror that chased her. Her first shift had left her body weak and trembling, her wolf barely awakened, untested. She had dreamt of this moment her entire life, becoming one with Lumi, feeling the power of the beast inside her.  
  
But she had never imagined it would feel like this.  
  
Pain had ripped through her bones, twisting and reshaping her flesh until she no longer recognized herself. And before she had even recovered, before she had a chance to revel in her new form, he had been there.  
  
Kyle Vaelmont.  
  
The Alpha‚Äôs brother. The man who had always looked at her with something lurking behind his gaze, something possessive, something cruel.  
  
He had waited for this. Waited for the moment she would be at her weakest.  
  
‚ÄúYou should feel honored,‚Äù he had whispered, his breath hot against her ear. His grip had been unrelenting, his claws just beneath the surface of his skin. ‚ÄúYou were always meant to be mine.‚Äù  
  
She had begged. She had fought. But he was stronger, faster. A fully trained warrior, while she was nothing more than a trembling girl learning what it meant to be a wolf.  
  
Then something inside her had snapped.  
  
She didn‚Äôt remember the moment her wolf had taken over. One second, she was clawing at his arms, gasping for air as he pinned her down‚Ä¶  
  
NYQXEE'S POV  
  
Pain has been my only companion for as long as I can remember. It lingers in the bruises on my skin, in the whispers that follow me through the halls, in the glares of those who once called me family. There is no escape, no moment of peace. Only suffering.  
  
Everyone in the pack despises me. I am Nyqxee from the House of the Shadowfangs, and to them, I am nothing more than a stain on their honor, a disgrace they wish never existed.  
  
Not because I betrayed them. Not because I turned rogue. But because, on the night of my first shift, I killed Kyle Vaelmont, the Alpha‚Äôs brother.  
  
And for that, they will never forgive me.  
  
No one cared why I did it. No one wanted to know the truth.  
  
Kyle Vaelmont had always looked at me with something dark in his eyes, something that made my skin crawl. When I was younger, I didn‚Äôt understand it. But as I grew older, I learned what that look meant. He would find reasons to touch me when no one was watching, a hand brushing too low on my back, fingers lingering on my wrist, a whisper too close to my ear. And then one night, looking and touching weren‚Äôt enough.  
  
""You belong to me now,"" he growled, his grip bruising, claws barely concealed. ""No one will question an Alpha‚Äôs brother taking a mate.""  
  
My wolf, Lumi, was still waking inside me, struggling against the new sensations of my first shift. My body ached, my bones still tender from the transformation. I was weak. Vulnerable. He knew that.  
  
I fought him with everything I had, but he was stronger.  
  
""Stop, please,"" I begged, my voice shaking as I pushed against his chest. He didn‚Äôt stop. He pinned me down, his breath hot and reeking of whiskey, his teeth grazing the spot where a mate‚Äôs mark should be.  
  
Then something inside me snapped.  
  
Pain lanced through my body as Lumi surfaced in a frenzy of fear and rage. The next thing I knew, Kyle‚Äôs blood stained my fangs, his body collapsed beneath me. His throat had been ripped open. He was gone.  
  
And I had done it.  
  
But instead of seeing a girl who had defended herself, the pack saw a murderer.  
  
They didn‚Äôt care that he had tried to force a bond on me. They didn‚Äôt care that he had been a monster lurking among them. They only saw the blood on my hands and the body at my feet.  
  
From that night on, I became nothing more than a disgrace, a shadow they refused to acknowledge.  
  
They made sure I suffered for it.  
  
""Where the hell is she?! Where is that worthless mutt?!"" Ashley Vaelmont‚Äôs voice rings out, sharp and venomous, echoing down the narrow hallways of the pack house. The bitterness in her tone claws at me, and I feel the familiar knot of dread settle in my stomach. I clench my jaw, preparing myself for whatever fresh hell she‚Äôs decided to rain down on me today. It never gets any easier.  
  
I step out of my tiny room, a place no bigger than a closet that had been shoved next to the storage room on the second floor, out of sight, out of mind. The walls are bare, the floor cold beneath my feet, the thin mattress barely offering any comfort. There‚Äôs a cracked mirror propped against the wall, reflecting a girl I barely recognize anymore. It‚Äôs been like this for years empty, cold, and void of warmth.  
  
In the corner of the room sits a small pile of books my only escape from this nightmare. They‚Äôre worn, dog-eared, each page stained with tears I can‚Äôt take back. They‚Äôre the only things that make me feel a semblance of peace. But even they feel like an illusion now. Nothing lasts.  
  
I take a deep breath, trying to steady myself before I walk into the hallway. But the moment I step out, a fabric slaps against my face, soft but heavy. My hands instinctively reach up, pulling the dress down from my face. The sight of it makes my heart skip. A dress. A piece of clothing that should be a symbol of beauty, of femininity but to me, it‚Äôs a symbol of punishment.  
  
I lower it slowly, already knowing what‚Äôs coming.  
  
And then she‚Äôs there.  
  
Ashley Vaelmont stands in front of me, dressed in an expensive silk gown, her presence suffocating in its perfection. Every strand of her blonde hair is in place, every curve accentuated by the fabric, as if she were crafted by some higher being to be flawless. But her eyes, they're cold, cruel, void of any humanity. She looks at me like I‚Äôm nothing but dirt beneath her heels. Something to be discarded, something to be controlled.  
  
One hand rests on her hip, her manicured nails gleaming under the harsh light. The other hand twitches with impatience. She doesn‚Äôt even need to speak for me to feel her anger radiating off her. But, of course, she does speak.  
  
""Um..."" I flick my gaze to the dress on the floor, barely masking my annoyance. I let the sarcasm slip from my mouth, my voice a little too loud. ""Is this supposed to mean something to me?""  
  
Her eyes darken, her expression tightening into a mask of pure hatred. Without warning, her hand whips across my face, the slap so hard that it makes my head snap to the side. The metallic taste of blood floods my mouth before I can even react. My cheek burns. I want to scream, to fight back, but I know better. I‚Äôve learned what happens when I do that.  
  
The next thing I know, her foot slams into my stomach, knocking the wind out of me. The air leaves my lungs in a rush, and I collapse to the cold floor, gasping for air. It feels like my ribs might break with the force of it. But I‚Äôm used to this. The pain. The humiliation. It‚Äôs not new. It‚Äôs never new.  
  
""I told you to hand wash it!"" she screeches, her voice sharp, high-pitched, and full of anger. ""Do you think you're too good to follow simple instructions? You're worthless, can‚Äôt even do the most basic tasks right! You‚Äôre a disgrace!""  
  
I barely have time to raise my arms in defense before her next blow lands, and then another. Each one hits harder than the last, each one tearing at me, chipping away at the parts of me that still believe I can get through this. I don‚Äôt fight back. I can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs not worth it. It‚Äôs never been worth it.  
  
When she finally grows bored of using me as her personal punching bag, I drag myself up, my body aching in every place. I stagger toward the Omega bathroom, each step a reminder of how broken I am. The cold water stings as I splash it across my face, trying to numb the pain, trying to drown out the thoughts that have been gnawing at me for as long as I can remember. Lumi, my wolf, whimpers softly in the back of my mind. I can feel her, feel the sadness she‚Äôs carried for me. But she knows what I do, fighting back is pointless. Not yet.  
  
I stare at myself in the bathroom mirror, but I can barely recognize the face staring back. A girl, bruised and battered, but still standing. Barely. I pull my long, tangled hair into a loose ponytail, ignoring the reflection of the girl I once was. The girl who had dreams, who thought she might have something more than just survival. That girl died long ago. Now, I‚Äôm just a shell.  
  
The scent of sizzling bacon and freshly brewed coffee filters through the air, snapping me out of my thoughts. Breakfast. I swallow the lump in my throat, knowing I have to go down there. I have no choice. The pack needs food, and I‚Äôm the one who prepares it.  
  
With over a hundred wolves living in the pack house, preparing their meals has become an exhausting, thankless job. Omegas like me, the invisible ones, do all the work. Our hands move quickly, efficiently, assembling plates of sausage, eggs, and toast as if this is what we were born to do. My stomach tightens painfully, begging for food, for sustenance, but I know better than to take even a single bite. To eat is to ask for trouble.  
  
Then, he walks in.  
  
Alpha Glaive.  
  
He strides into the room, every movement oozing confidence and power. He‚Äôs the strongest wolf in the pack, the one everyone fears and respects. He‚Äôs the one with control.  
  
I used to admire him, maybe even have a childish crush on him back when I thought life could be different. But not anymore. That fantasy died the moment I realized he was just like everyone else, indifferent, cold, and cruel. A part of the system that keeps me trapped in this place.  
  
His gaze falls on me, and I feel it, like a punch to the gut. His body tenses, his jaw clenches. For a second, he looks... startled? I can‚Äôt figure it out. But I look away before I can make sense of it. It doesn‚Äôt matter. He doesn‚Äôt matter.  
  
I finish serving the breakfast, my hands moving on autopilot, trying to ignore the insults and snickers being thrown my way. Even my parents refuse to acknowledge me, their eyes cold and resentful. They never loved me. I‚Äôve known that for years. They only see a mistake, a disappointment. I swallow the sting of rejection, pushing it deep down where it belongs.  
  
I won‚Äôt cry. I won‚Äôt break.  
  
There‚Äôs only one thing left to hold on to the goal. To survive. To make it until I turn twenty-one. That‚Äôs my only hope. Then I can leave. Leave this nightmare behind and never look back. I just have to hold on.  
  
""Don‚Äôt worry, the right one will love us,"" Lumi whispers, her voice soft but full of hope.  
  
A mate. Someone who will love us, someone who will protect us. Lumi‚Äôs dream has always been to find our soulmate. The one who will make all of this pain worth it. But I know better. I‚Äôve seen enough to understand that no one is coming to save me. Not now, not ever.  
  
And as the pack members continue with their lives, oblivious to the girl who‚Äôs drowning in their shadow, I realize just how alone I truly am.  
  
No one is coming to save me.  
  
After finishing my chores, I step outside, the warmth of the sun grazing my skin. It feels foreign, this sensation. My body is too pale from being locked away in this suffocating house for far too long. The cold, the darkness, it‚Äôs all I‚Äôve known for years. But now, as the sun‚Äôs warmth kisses my skin, a small part of me feels alive again.  
  
Lumi purrs softly in the back of my mind, basking in the moment of peace. She revels in the feel of the sunlight, and for a split second, I let myself enjoy it too. The world outside is so different from the chaos inside. It‚Äôs a fleeting feeling, but for this brief moment, I‚Äôm free. Free from the walls of the pack house, free from Ashley, free from the hurt that waits for me behind closed doors.  
  
I retreat to the bleachers, hoping for some solitude, hoping for just a little more time to breathe without fear. The warriors train below me, their movements fluid, calculated, each one a well-rehearsed display of strength. I watch closely, my gaze following every strike, every block, every pivot. I may not be allowed to fight, but that doesn‚Äôt mean I can‚Äôt learn. One day, I‚Äôll need to defend myself. One day, I won‚Äôt just be a punching bag for Ashley or anyone else.  
  
My thoughts are interrupted when something sharp tugs at my hair, pulling me violently from the safety of my thoughts. My body is wrenched backward, and before I can even react, I hit the ground with a sickening thud.  
  
The breath is knocked out of me, and I barely register the sky above before a cruel laugh fills my ears, cold and mocking.  
  
I blink up, disoriented, trying to gather my bearings. Through the blur of pain and confusion, I see her. Ashina.  
  
She stands over me, her posture commanding, her arms crossed, and that damn smirk playing on her lips. The same smirk she always wears when she knows she‚Äôs won, when she knows she‚Äôs got me exactly where she wants me. She looks down at me, the contempt in her gaze so clear, it cuts deeper than any of her words ever could.  
  
""Don‚Äôt even think about looking at him again,"" Ashina sneers, her voice dripping with venom. ""You have no right to even breathe the same air as him. You're nothing but a lowly Omega. Stay out of my way, or I‚Äôll make sure you regret it.""  
  
Her words are like acid, burning my skin as they hit. And before I can even think to respond, her foot slams into my stomach.  
  
Pain explodes through my ribs. It‚Äôs sharp, intense, and for a moment, I forget how to breathe.  
  
I gasp, the air rushing out of my lungs, and then the world blurs again as the pounding begins. My body goes numb from the force of it. Each hit lands with a sickening crack, each kick a reminder of how small, how weak I am in comparison to her. The world spins, the pain is unbearable, but I can‚Äôt stop it. I can‚Äôt fight back.  
  
Ashina‚Äôs laughter rings in my ears, cruel and triumphant. I hate it. I hate her. But more than that, I hate myself for letting it happen. For not being strong enough to fight back. For not being enough to stop this pain from consuming me.  
  
Her foot lifts, and for a split second, I think it might be over. I think she‚Äôs done, but then it comes crashing down again, and I feel my ribs protest, my body pleading for mercy. I want to scream. I want to fight. I want to fight back with everything in me. But I know it won‚Äôt change anything. I‚Äôll just get hurt more. I always do.  
  
I close my eyes, trying to block it all out, trying to disappear into the numbness of my mind. But her voice, sharp and taunting, cuts through my thoughts. ‚ÄúStay down, loser. You‚Äôre nothing.‚Äù  
  
And the worst part is, I start to believe her.  
  


# CHAPTER 02: THE BREAKING POINT

NYQUEE'S POV  
  
A sharp cough rips through my chest, and before I can stop it, thick, metallic-tasting blood splatters onto the dirt floor. The taste lingers, bitter and heavy on my tongue. A fresh wave of pain tears through my ribs, each breath feeling like jagged knives slicing through my lungs. My body trembles, too weak, too broken. The bruises across my skin are only the visible wounds; the deeper ones, the ones that gnaw at my spirit, are far worse.  
  
Lumi, my wolf, stirs sluggishly in the back of my mind. She‚Äôs trying, so hard, to push her strength into me, to heal me. But we don‚Äôt shift often, not like the others, and our healing is slow, too slow. Even as she tries to reach out, to comfort me, I know we‚Äôre beyond the point where mere strength will save me. The pain in my chest, in my soul, is too much. My body, my spirit, they're all worn down, frayed at the edges.  
  
Still, I force myself to move. I push through the haze of pain, dragging my broken body toward the small shred of hope that‚Äôs left: the possibility of standing, of fighting back. But as I rise, a sharp heel slams into my leg, and I collapse back onto the dirt with a scream. The world tilts as my vision blurs, and for a moment, I feel like I might just let go.  
  
Ashina stands over me, her cruel, mocking smile stretched across her face. She presses the pointed tip of her shoe into my throat, the pressure biting into my skin. Her voice rings out, sickly sweet and full of contempt.  
  
""It would be so easy,"" she muses, her gaze never leaving my face. ""Just a little more pressure, and you‚Äôd finally be out of your misery.""  
  
The words cut deeper than the pain in my body, and I can feel my heart racing against the weight of her heel. My pulse is deafening in my ears, drowning out everything else. Lumi growls, her voice weak in my mind, urging me to fight, to resist. But how? How can I fight when I‚Äôm so broken? When every part of me is screaming for mercy?  
  
I don‚Äôt want to die. I refuse to die like this.  
  
Lumi surges forward, lending me what little strength she has left. The force of her presence flares in my chest like a tiny flame, warming me against the coldness of the world. I won‚Äôt submit. Not to her. Not to anyone.  
  
With a desperate grunt, I lift my leg and kick out, aiming for Ashina‚Äôs knee. The impact sends her sprawling, her smirk vanishing as she crashes to the dirt. The shock of it burns through me, but I don‚Äôt stop. I can‚Äôt stop.  
  
Her minions gasp, their shrill screams ringing in my ears, but none of them make a move to stop me. They‚Äôre all watching. Silent. Almost like they‚Äôre waiting for something to happen.  
  
Anger surges through me like a torrent of fire. It burns away the weakness, the self-doubt. Adrenaline drowns out the pain as I lunge at Ashina‚Äôs fallen form. Straddling her body, I slam my fist into her face. Again. And again. The satisfying crack of bone under my knuckles fills my ears, and for the first time in a long time, I don‚Äôt feel small. I don‚Äôt feel helpless. I feel alive, filled with rage, with defiance.  
  
Blood splatters, hot and sticky, painting her face in red. I don‚Äôt care. I don‚Äôt care about the consequences. All that matters is that I‚Äôm not just a victim anymore. I am more than that.  
  
A roar erupts around us, the sound of warriors forming a circle. Their shouts fill the air, some cheering me on, others urging Ashina to fight back. But she doesn‚Äôt. She never does. She‚Äôs all bark and no bite.  
  
Just as I‚Äôm about to strike again, a tingling sensation rushes down my spine. Before I can react, huge, strong hands grip my arms, lifting me off the ground with terrifying ease. I thrash, my fists flailing, but it‚Äôs useless. Lumi snarls, fighting against my captor, but she can‚Äôt win this battle.  
  
""Let me go!"" I scream, struggling with all the strength I have left, my body jerking in every direction. But the grip on my arms tightens, and I‚Äôm yanked backward, away from Ashina. My feet leave the ground, and for a moment, I‚Äôm weightless.  
  
And then, I see him.  
  
Glaive Vaelmont. The Alpha. He stands before me, his towering frame casting a long shadow under the midday sun. Sweat dampens his hair, making it stick to his forehead in loose strands. His bare chest rises and falls with steady breaths, and despite the anger in my heart, I can‚Äôt help but notice how breathtaking he is. Powerful. Dominant. Everything an Alpha should be.  
  
And I hate myself for noticing.  
  
His lips curl into a smirk, and for a second, it feels like he knows exactly what I‚Äôm thinking. My face burns, and I quickly look away, my fists clenching at my sides, too ashamed to meet his gaze.  
  
""Causing trouble again, Omega?"" His voice is cold, cutting through the air with sharpness that makes my blood run cold.  
  
""She attacked me first!"" I snap, my frustration leaking out in every word. I‚Äôm not afraid anymore. Not of Ashina. Not of him. I‚Äôm done with being quiet. Done with cowering.  
  
His smirk fades, replaced by a hard, unreadable expression. ""Do you even know who she is?""  
  
Before I can respond, his hand shoots out, gripping my throat with terrifying force. I gasp as my body slams into the rough bark of a tree, the air stolen from my lungs. His grip tightens, and the world tilts. My vision darkens, my nails clawing uselessly at his wrist as I struggle to breathe.  
  
""She‚Äôs your Luna,"" he growls.  
  
The words hit me like a punch to the gut, and for a moment, I can‚Äôt think. My body is numb. My mind is foggy. Luna. Ashina. The Alpha‚Äôs mate.  
  
I gasp again, the weight of it sinking in. My chest tightens, my heart racing in panic as the world spins around me. I‚Äôm nothing. Nothing but a weak, broken Omega caught in a world that doesn‚Äôt care about me.  
  
I try to fight. I try to push him off, but it‚Äôs like hitting a wall. His strength is unyielding, a constant, suffocating pressure that I can‚Äôt escape. My body is weak, my limbs like dead weight, and no matter how hard I thrash, I can‚Äôt break free from his grasp. Every attempt to resist is futile. My mind screams at me to fight, but my body is too broken, too worn down.  
  
Just when I think I might black out from the lack of air, his grip loosens. He releases me, and I crumple to the ground like a ragdoll, gasping for breath. My hands claw at the dirt beneath me, my lungs desperate for oxygen. Every inhale is ragged, every exhale painful. It feels like I‚Äôve been suffocating for hours, my body betraying me at every turn.  
  
I can‚Äôt focus on anything but the pounding in my chest, the heat that floods my veins, the overwhelming weight of helplessness that wraps around my entire being. My whole body is trembling, and I want to scream, but I don‚Äôt have the strength. The world is spinning, tilting around me as I struggle to stay conscious.  
  
Then, just as I‚Äôm about to lose myself to the darkness, I feel the ground shift beside me. I lift my head just enough to see Glaive crouching beside me. His face is unreadable, the coldness in his eyes sharper than ever. But for a split second, there‚Äôs something else. A hesitation. A softness in the way he looks at me. I don‚Äôt understand it. It‚Äôs almost like he regrets what just happened‚Äîbut then his eyes darken, and the expression hardens back into stone, and I know. I know that softness was never meant for me.  
  
""You will be locked in the dungeon for the next few days,"" he says, his voice cold and indifferent.  
  
A chill washes over me, sinking deep into my bones. The dungeon. I‚Äôve been there before. I know what happens in those walls. The isolation. The darkness. The beatings. Everything that shatters you, piece by piece. The terror rises in my chest, a thick, suffocating weight.  
  
""No,"" I whisper, my voice hoarse and cracked, betraying my desperation. ""No, please. I can‚Äôt‚Äî""  
  
She started it.  
  
The words slip out before I can stop them, a final attempt to justify myself. But it‚Äôs useless. Glaive doesn‚Äôt even look at me. He doesn‚Äôt care. My voice is just noise to him, something to dismiss and ignore. He turns away from me like I‚Äôm nothing more than a bothersome fly, an inconvenience he doesn‚Äôt have the patience to deal with. And then, just when I think it can‚Äôt get worse, it does.  
  
""Before I forget,"" he says, his voice low, cold, and emotionless. ""I, Glaive Vaelmont, reject you, Nyqxee, as my mate and future Luna.""  
  
The world stills.  
  
Time seems to freeze, the weight of his words crashing down on me like an avalanche. I can‚Äôt breathe. I can‚Äôt think. I can‚Äôt process it. It‚Äôs like a part of me‚Äîsomething deep inside, something I didn‚Äôt even realize I needed‚Äîis suddenly ripped away. The bond we shared, the connection that had once felt so unbreakable, is gone. And I‚Äôm left standing in its ruins, gasping for air, unable to comprehend what has just happened.  
  
His words echo in my mind, repeating, taunting me. They‚Äôre like a cruel joke, a twisted punchline that I can‚Äôt escape. I had felt it‚Äîthe bond between us. He had known, too. He‚Äôd felt it just as strongly as I had. And yet, he stood by and let them hurt me. He did nothing to stop the pain, the torment. He let me be broken, and now he‚Äôs taking the last thing I had left. The last shred of hope. The last glimmer of love.  
  
Ashina stumbles beside him, her face bruised but victorious. Her blonde hair is disheveled, her lips curling into a smug, triumphant smile as she leans in close to Glaive, whispering something in his ear. I can‚Äôt hear her words, but I know exactly what they are. She‚Äôs gloating. She‚Äôs savoring the moment.  
  
And then Glaive speaks again, his voice colder than ever.  
  
""Lock her up,"" he orders, his words final and unyielding. ""Whip her every day until I say otherwise.""  
  
The command cuts through me like a blade, and a sharp sting snaps against my cheek, dragging me back into the harsh reality of the moment. I barely have time to react before rough hands grab my arms, yanking me to my feet. I don‚Äôt fight. I don‚Äôt scream. I don‚Äôt beg. There‚Äôs nothing left to fight for, nothing left to say. I‚Äôve already lost everything.  
  
I‚Äôm dragged through the pack house, past wolves who don‚Äôt even spare me a second glance. Their eyes are cold, indifferent. They don‚Äôt care. I pass my parents‚Äîmy mother and father‚Äîwho don‚Äôt even stop this. They don‚Äôt intervene. They don‚Äôt try to protect me. It‚Äôs as if I‚Äôm invisible to them, just another pawn in the game they refuse to play.  
  
By the time we reach the dungeon, I am numb. Completely, utterly numb. My body moves on autopilot, my mind a blank, empty void. The guards shove me inside, and I hit the ground hard. My body protests, but I don‚Äôt move. I don‚Äôt have the strength. I don‚Äôt have the will to get up anymore.  
  
The door slams shut behind me, the sound of metal against stone echoing in the silence. Darkness swallows me whole.  
  
And then it happens.  
  
A sharp, searing pain explodes in my chest, like something inside me is breaking apart. My breath catches, my fingers claw at the cold stone floor. It burns. It hurts worse than any beating, worse than any wound. It‚Äôs like my heart is being torn from my chest, leaving nothing but a hollow, empty void in its place.  
  
I let out a strangled sob, the sound foreign in my throat. For the first time in years, I cry. I cry for everything I‚Äôve lost‚Äîthe life I could have had, the family who abandoned me, the mate who was supposed to protect me, who was supposed to love me. I cry for the pieces of me that will never be whole again.  
  
Lumi is silent. She‚Äôs withdrawn, curling into the deepest part of my mind. For the first time ever, I am truly alone.  
  
Days pass in a blur. The guards come. They whip me. Over and over, the leather cracks across my back, my skin splitting open, blood pooling onto the cold dungeon floor. The pain should numb me by now, but it doesn‚Äôt. It never does.  
  
They give me one meal a day. Stale bread and water. It tastes like ash in my mouth, but I don‚Äôt care.  
  
I don‚Äôt see Lumi anymore. I don‚Äôt feel her presence in my mind. She‚Äôs gone, or maybe I‚Äôve lost her. Either way, I don‚Äôt feel anything. Not anymore. Not after everything.  
  
And then, on the third day, I rise to my feet. My body trembles with the effort, my muscles aching with every movement. But I force myself to stand, clutching my chest as the words slip out of my mouth, barely above a whisper.  
  
""I, Nyqxee, accept your rejection, Glaive Vaelmont.""  
  
I don‚Äôt expect relief. I don‚Äôt expect freedom. I don‚Äôt expect anything anymore.

1kibdoc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/1kibdoc/smoke_damage_what_are_the_requirementsguidelines/,"Smoke damage - what are the requirements/guidelines for determining if something is cleanable vs salvageable? AZ, AAA insurance","Had a fire and currently I'm im disagreement with what they're saying is cleanable.

Most things I can concede on but the items that were expensive and/or items used for edible items I want those to be replaced.

Ive asked my adjuster multiple times for the criteria used to determine cleanable vs non-salvageable with no response. 

The contents company recommended by the restoration company initially said some items (which I had done a surface wipe on) were cleanable. After sharing additional information including IIRC guidelines with my vendor they updated those items to be non salavagable.

My insurance company hired a 2nd opinion company called Lyons Restore. Adjuster said ""they agreed on everything except the tv"". She never specified which tv, and when asked she wont tell me. She also wont share that 2nd opinion report with me.

When i sent an email to the adjuster and her supervisor her supervisor responded with ""I agree with the cleaning contractors that handle these types of claims on a regular basis and who informed us that these items can be cleaned""

That was it, no acknowledgement of the iirc guidelines ive shared, no acknowledgement that the wnd opinion company they hired likely disagreed that the tv can be cleaned ($3,500 tv which I believe the 2nd opinion company deemed non salavagable but cant confirm because AAA wont send me that report). This tv was within 15 ft of the fire.

For content, I had a work computer in my office, probably 50+ ft from the fire. While the house was filled with smoke I held my breath and ran in to grab that work computer, so it was only exposed to smoke for maybe 5-10 minutes. Despite this, I tried to use it the next day and the amount of smoke and odor produced from it burnt my eyes and throat so much that it was unusable. I returned that work computer to my employer and it was replaced.

Other items which were exposed for much longer will have much more soot and smoke damage. I understand they can be cleaned but my understanding is that thia damage can linger and not become apparent for many months later.

I was willing to concede on all items to be cleanable (id just take the cashout option instead of having them cleaned and then pay the difference out of pocket) with the exception of:

The living room tv
Espresso machine which was within 1 or 2 ft of the fire
Two laptops in the office
Two monitors

AAA wouldnt even entertain anything I was saying. Their stance is ""experts said they can be cleaned"" but one of those experts changed their listing of what can be cleaned after I provided additional information.
The other expert which they hired (lyons restore), i havent been able to get that report. Additionally I dont know what information they used to make that determination, and i believe the me surface wiping some items made them look less exposed than they were. 

$$$ aside, what about my safety? I will never be comfortable using the espresso machine for coffee without the thought of ""what if theres soot inside and im going myself cancer"". That cup of joy will turn into a cup of anxiety and that is not a preloss condition. I know my feelings dont factor into here, but even so, i dont think they can effectively clean that espresso machine not only for safety, but also for it to maintain its lifespan. This fire was 6 weeks ago and they just got approval to clean them yesterday but i told them to hold off as i dont agree to the settlement by AAA

Also ive asked many times if a warranty would be included or any kind of assurance by AAA that if they failed prematurely theyd replace them, but again no response and they wlnt acknowledge what I thought were reasonable questions.

I dont feel like ive made any unfair requests, every request ive made was backed by rationale and iirc guidelines which I thought would at least start a conversation.

Im at a loss at what to do. My adjuster has been difficult to work with, shes antagonistic and my contractor has told me in the 16 years hes been doing restoration work hes never workes with anyone like her. Hes also asked for her supervisor on multiple occasions which shes ignord (she has a pattern of ignoring communications she doesnt like). Ive also requested her supervisor which she wouldnt provide and ive also requested a new adjuster which she ignored.

I eventually calles the 1800 number to get her supervisors information but he hasnt been much better. If her supervisor ignores emails and is dismissive then I guess it makes sense that she is as well. Seems like theres no accountability.

Not sure what to do at this point, dealing with the fire and being displaced has been stressful enough, dealing with this adjuster who has a ""my way or Highway"" attitude has added a ton of stress.

Shes made ridiculous statements like saying my restoration company should be working at the same time the ozone machines were running which is ridiculous and can literally kill them, she told me a story about how when she was younger her house had a fire and to this day her dad still uses a desk that was charred, trying to minimize my situation and get me to agree to contents being fire damaged as no big deal, shes told me i dont need a contents company because they would just ""wipe it down with vinegar"".

Shes extremely retaliatory, uneducated on these matters, unprofessional, and unempathetic. I hate to say it but dealing with her has been the most stressful part of this fire, 2nd to me not being able to find one of my dogs for about 20 seconds during the fire.

This isnt JUST about my personal contents, but every step of the way weve had to fight for things that should have been cut and dried. 

Any advice would be appreciated

Plus Points:

We live in Kanton Zurich in a house with a lovely garden ( when the weather allows us to be outside )

I earn 20k+ for a 4-day week,  and my wife earns pocket money by working 20% ( 90 mins. every day ) as my Admin at my  Company. Our 2 kids go to Private Boarding School.

We have 2 cars, a Tesla and a Smart, and enjoy the high salaries and short working days by going regularly for weekend breaks to our Appt in Italy, and for longer breaks back home to the good old US of A. 

My wife spends her time going shopping for food in Germany and for personal shopping in the Bahnhofstrasse ( a street we love to be seen in ).

So that's the good points.

  
Now the BAD!

The Zurichers are so unfriendly! I mean soooo cold and heartless.  In the 25 years we have lived here we have not made one Swiss friend. Not ONE!

Most Zurichers can speak a little bit of English, but as soon as you go to the countryside it is non-existent. I mean how is that possible? We can't communicate with anyone out here. Not even the Postman!

The prices of food, not only in the Globus/Jelmoli, but also in the Mirgros and Co-op are horrendous.  I like a good piece of  Sirloin a couple of times a week, and for that my wife has to - yes HAS TO - drive to germany to buy it.

The Social Activities are so boring. What do you Swiss people do? It just seems an endless chore of walking or hiking up a Mountain at 6 AM just for the view, and then stand there - totally silent of course - admiring it for a few minutes, before walking back, all mostly in silence.

The weather is so Bad. Cold winters, with horrible wind, the spring and autumn so random, with rain and wind, and then an awfully hot summer with nothing to do apart from going to the lake or try an enjoy a coffee in a Street Cafe.

Another thing - who likes the coffee here?!?  I miss a good cup of American Coffee!  And the breakfast! Musli, what is that? Why are there no fresh bagles or donuts available?

Sports Bars?  Why are there no possibilities of watching American Football or NFL/NBA games here?  The only sport I see here is Soccer - which is good for women, I grant you, but again here it's not followed by women!!!

The Swiss Work-Life Balance sucks!  My wife attends a local coffee morning ( and has to bring our imported coffee in a flask, lol ) and is often inviting  other couples to spontaneously come with us to our Appartment in Italy, just for a 3 or 4 day mini-break, and yet most here work a 42 hour week, and have plans months in advance at the weekends? For real?!?

The transient expat community!!!  We meet so many really nice Americans, but sadly they are only transient workers here and leave us after a year or two. We met a great couple from Argentina in 2007 ( who were luckily raised in Boston, so no problems with the Language ) but they left for Barcelona or Lisbon ( somewhere in Spain ) in 2008 and we still miss them.

And now the UGLY!

Oh my, where to start!

The buildings in Zurich. So ugly. No real high-rises.The Motorways are so small. The driving experience is so bad! The night life.  Just BAD! No examples, it's too depressing.  Even the people! No-one is smiling, everyone is dressed in greys and blacks, this place is just UGLY, U-G-L-Y = UUGGLLYY!!!

Top of the UGLY LADDER though is Schwiiizerd√º√º√ºtsch.

WHY?  Just why do you continue with this awful dialect? Why is English not compulsory in Schools here? It would help you people so much with integration!

The constant throat-clearing in every sentence makes me refuse to learn - or even attempt to learn- any of it. Even Gr√º√º√ºtzi sounds like a personal attack!

Why, oh why is this place so grey, monotone and depressing?

The only thing that keeps me going is the money I earn, and the chance to leave for a few days a week to spend the money in Italy, or thankfully back home the few weeks a year we're able to go back to our Appt. in NYC or the beach house Upstate.

  
Any answers? Please in English!

 Coming to this island seemed like a good idea at the time. It meant I wouldn‚Äôt have to return home and take care of my parents during my summer vacation while they were too wasted to even get out of bed, except when they needed to find their next fix. So, when my boyfriend, Abel, suggested that I join him to visit his family on the island, I thought it was a great idea.  
  
This place is so much more than I expected. They even have a high school and a college here, which makes it even better.   
  
As we are about to start our freshman year of college, we thought this would be the best way to spend our vacation‚Äîon a beautiful, sunny beach that is surprisingly peaceful, considering how many people live here.   
  
Until now, with the boat over selling tickets we weren‚Äôt able to leave as planned. But I‚Äôm starting to think we‚Äôve over stayed our welcome here anyway. I hadn‚Äôt really made an effort to get to know anyone while I‚Äôd been here all summer. It might be good to get back home and back into my normal routine again.  
  
But of course, there was the last party of the summer vacation on the last night, and Abel was the first to agree to go to it.  
  
I was never one to shy away from a party, but I always knew when enough was enough. I refuse to end up like my parents.  
  
We were sitting on the couch in the living room and I heard someone call Abel‚Äôs name in the distance and there was a group of people on the other side of the room waving at him, so he gave me a kiss on the cheek to go over and say a quick hello to them.   
  
I sat there for I don‚Äôt know how long and I was starting to get a little bored with this party. All I wanted to do was go back to Abel‚Äôs mother‚Äôs house and catch up on preparations for college. Even if we‚Äôre not there to start yet.  
  
I was just about to get up and go find Abel to tell him that I was leaving when his best friend from middle school, Dean, sat next to me and handed me a drink.  
  
‚ÄúDean, right?‚Äù I asked.   
  
‚ÄúYeah. We met the other day. Just briefly.‚Äù He said.   
  
‚ÄúRight. Where‚Äôs Abel? Did you see where he went?‚Äù I asked.  
  
‚ÄúI think he went to get another drink. And I thought now would be a good time for us to get to know each other.‚Äù He said.  
  
‚ÄúAbel told me a fair bit about you two as kids.‚Äù I said.  
  
‚ÄúOh crap. I hope he didn‚Äôt tell you everything.‚Äù Dean said, shaking his head.   
  
‚ÄúHe told me enough to know that I need to watch out for you.‚Äù I smirked.  
  
‚ÄúI can imagine. We were a nightmare for every adult responsible for us‚Äîparents and teachers alike,‚Äù Dean replied.  
  
‚ÄúI've heard. Impressive,‚Äù I said.  
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard some stories about you in high school as well. You weren‚Äôt the easiest kid on teachers.‚Äù Dean said.   
  
‚ÄúWhat can I say? It made school more interesting.‚Äù I said.   
  
‚ÄúOh, yeah? I can‚Äôt wait to hear about the rest of the stories that you got up to. But aren‚Äôt you guys supposed to be starting college soon? Why are you still here?‚Äù Dean asked.  
  
‚ÄúThere was a mix-up with our tickets. Apparently, they overbooked the boat back, and now we have to wait for an opening. So, we‚Äôre not sure if we‚Äôre going to sign up for college here until we can get back home or not,‚Äù I explained.  
  
‚ÄúThat sucks. Boats aren‚Äôt very frequent around here‚Äîusually only every couple of weeks,‚Äù Dean replied.  
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôve been talking to them, and they told me there‚Äôs no guarantee. So I called the college here in town, and they said we can sign up here so we aren‚Äôt missing out on school, at least until we can get back home,‚Äù I explained.  
  
‚ÄúWow, very organized,‚Äù Dean said, raising his eyebrows.  
  
‚ÄúYeah. I guess so. We can‚Äôt really afford to sit around an island and do nothing.‚Äù I said.  
  
‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt we go outside where it‚Äôs not so loud?‚Äù Dean suggested. So I looked around a bit and I couldn‚Äôt see Abel anywhere, so I agreed.  
  
We made our way through the house, which smelled of cigarettes, beer, and m\*\*\*\*\*\*\*a. As soon as we stepped outside, I lit up a cigarette as well.  
  
‚ÄúSo, how long have you two been together?‚Äù Dean asked.   
  
‚ÄúSince sophomore year. So, almost three years,‚Äù I said.  
  
‚ÄúWow. That‚Äôs impressive for Abel,‚Äù Dean remarked.  
  
‚ÄúI have a feeling there are a few stories he left out,‚Äù I commented.  
  
‚ÄúI think that might have to be something that he tells you about. I might have just put my foot in it.‚Äù He said. But all I did was nod my head.  
  
He took a step closer to me. It felt a little uncomfortable, and I noticed he was more focused on my chest than my face, which was becoming quite obvious.  
  
The guy didn‚Äôt seem that drunk, so there was no excuse for his behavior. I wasn't wearing a bikini like many of the other girls at the party; I had on a tank top and denim shorts, which wasn‚Äôt revealing at all.  
  
‚ÄúHey, my eyes are up here,‚Äù I snapped at him.  
  
‚ÄúYeah, I know. I‚Äôm just surprised that Abel was able to catch a girl like you,‚Äù he said, stepping closer. I instinctively took a step back.  
  
I made it clear that he was being inappropriate and started looking around for someone else to talk to, hoping to find a way to escape. However, I didn‚Äôt really know anyone at the party.  
  
That‚Äôs when I spotted him‚Äîa guy leaning against the side of the house with a few friends around him, staring straight at me. I hadn't seen him all summer, and I couldn't help but wonder how that was even possible.  
  
He was tall and well-built, with tattoos covering his arms and neck. I could only imagine how many he had hidden beneath his clothes.   
  
I looked away, but I could still feel his eyes boring into the back of my head; he was still staring at me.   
  
Glancing back at the house, I noticed I couldn't see Abel. It shouldn't take him this long to get a drink, so I started walking toward the house, but Dean grabbed me by the arm.   
  
‚ÄúWhere are you going?‚Äù he asked.   
  
‚ÄúI need to go to the bathroom. Is that alright with you?‚Äù I replied. Once I said that, he released me.   
  
I went back inside the house and headed to the kitchen, but Abel was nowhere to be found.   
  
I began walking down the hallway away from the kitchen in search of a bathroom when I opened one of the doors.   
  
That‚Äôs when I realized that I had walked into a bedroom and there were two people having s\*x on the bed.   
  
‚ÄúOh s\*\*t. Sorry.‚Äù I said, before I looked at them again. ‚ÄúAbel!‚Äù I yelled.   
  
In his naked sweaty mess, thrusting inside this other girl he didn't even realize someone opened the door. Not until I yelled his name.   
  
‚ÄúOh s\*\*t. Novalee, this isn‚Äôt what it looks like,‚Äù Abel tried to plead.   
  
‚ÄúHow the f\*\*k could I confuse this for anything else?‚Äù I yelled.   
  
‚ÄúI thought she was you,‚Äù he defended.   
  
‚ÄúI have blonde hair. She has black. Try again,‚Äù I remarked as the girl began getting dressed.   
  
‚ÄúMaybe he just got tired of having s\*x with the same girl,‚Äù she taunted. My fists were clenched at my sides.   
  
‚ÄúMacy, shut up,‚Äù Abel warned her. Macy? As in his ex-girlfriend? f\*\*k this s\*\*t.  
  
‚ÄúWhat? Maybe she needs to hear it,‚Äù Macy said, putting her bra back on.   
  
I stood there, waiting for her to finish getting dressed before I walked over to her. I grabbed her by the hair and kicked her in the stomach, causing her to fall straight back through the closed window behind her.  
  


# CHAPTER 2

 I turned around and stormed out of the room, with Abel chasing after me while trying to put on his clothes.   
  
I made my way outside, where Dean was standing near the same window from which the girl had been thrown. A few people were trying to help her, but she was lying on the ground, crying. Abel caught up to me and grabbed my arm.  
  
‚ÄúGet the hell off me!‚Äù I shouted, struggling to break free from his grip.   
  
‚ÄúIt was an accident,‚Äù Abel insisted.   
  
‚ÄúWow. So, who threw her out the window?‚Äù Dean asked, drawing everyone‚Äôs attention.   
  
‚ÄúShe did. And where the hell were you?‚Äù Abel shot back at Dean.   
  
‚ÄúWait a minute! Dean was supposed to be distracting me while you were f\*\*\*\*\*g your ex?‚Äù I yelled.   
  
‚ÄúIt was his idea,‚Äù Dean said, quickly blaming his friend.  
  
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt do it.‚Äù Abel pleaded. But I pulled my arm back and punch the unsuspecting Dean right in the face, making him fall backwards on the ground.   
  
‚ÄúIf you ever come near me again Abel, I will beat the living crap out of you. Now stay the f\*\*k away.‚Äù I yelled, storming off into the dark forest.   
  
I had to pass that same tattooed guy who was still watching every move I made, but this time, I only glanced at him as I walked by.  
  
I made it back to Abel's parents' house, and they were asleep, leaving a light on for us when we returned home. I quietly entered the bedroom, grabbed my suitcase, and started tossing all of my clothes into it. I needed to go to the bathroom to get my toiletries, and I placed them in my suitcase as well.  
  
‚ÄúNovalee. Sweetie, what‚Äôs going on?‚Äù Abel‚Äôs mother, Rhea, asked as I was zipping up my suitcase.  
  
‚ÄúThank you so much for letting me stay here. I really appreciate it, and I like you and your family. But maybe you should talk to Abel about this,‚Äù I replied.  
  
She lowered her head, shaking it while pinching the bridge of her nose. ‚ÄúWas it Macy?‚Äù she asked, and I looked at her strangely. ‚ÄúMacy has always been a pain in my ass, ever since Abel started dating her and even after they broke up,‚Äù she explained.  
  
‚ÄúWell, I guess Abel doesn‚Äôt have to tell you,‚Äù I said.  
  
‚ÄúWhere are you going to stay? You don‚Äôt even know when you can leave,‚Äù she said.  
  
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine. I‚Äôll be okay. I can take care of myself,‚Äù I reassured her.  
  
‚ÄúI can‚Äôt just let you leave without a plan,‚Äù she insisted.  
  
‚ÄúRhea, I really do appreciate everything you‚Äôve done for me. But I can‚Äôt stay in the same house as him. I promise I‚Äôll be alright,‚Äù I said. She then walked over and hugged me.  
  
‚ÄúFor what it‚Äôs worth, we were really hoping he wouldn‚Äôt f\*\*k things up with you. You seemed really good for him,‚Äù she said.  
  
‚ÄúI appreciate that. I should go before he shows up. I might see you around,‚Äù I replied.  
  
‚ÄúAlright. If you need anything, please don‚Äôt hesitate to call,‚Äù she said.  
  
I left the house with my suitcase and managed to get out without running into Abel. He was probably still at the party, trying to help Dean and Macy. But he should have known he was playing a dangerous game.  
  
I don't like to do it, but he knows that when I‚Äôm angry enough, I tend to lash out.  
  
I'm not proud of my actions, and I often feel ashamed the next day once I've calmed down. In the heat of the moment, however, I find it hard to control myself. I lash out, and for some reason, I have the strength to hurt others. I trained in kickboxing when I was younger, and even my instructors were impressed by my strength.  
  
It has been useful in the past when certain assholes have visited my parents, but I realize that I could probably address things differently.  
  
I walked around the dark island alone and made my way to a private beach where I knew no one lived. I didn‚Äôt really have anywhere to go, so I sat on the beach, lit a cigarette, and stared up at the stars.   
  
Suddenly, I heard something rustling in the forest behind me. I turned to look, but I couldn‚Äôt see anything; it was too dark. I assumed it was just an animal, so I lay down on the sand, using a couple of my clothes as a pillow.   
  
When I woke up the next morning, the sun was shining right in my face, waking me early. I got up and looked out at the ocean for a few minutes before grabbing my suitcase and heading back towards town.   
  
I knew the college would be open, so I snuck into the gym and went to the locker room for a shower. I changed into some fresh, clean clothes.   
  
As I was coming out of the locker room, I bumped into something hard. I looked up, and it was the same tattooed guy from the night before.   
  
‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù I said.  
  
He looked at me oddly before turning back to the locker room, where steam filled the air.   
  
‚ÄúDid you just shower in there?‚Äù he asked.   
  
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs it to you?‚Äù I replied.   
  
‚ÄúYou were staying with Abel, weren‚Äôt you?‚Äù he pressed.   
  
‚ÄúMaybe,‚Äù I said.   
  
‚ÄúWhere did you sleep last night?‚Äù he continued.   
  
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs none of your business. Do you always ask strangers this many questions?‚Äù I responded.   
  
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a small island,‚Äù he said.   
  
‚ÄúApparently, not small enough,‚Äù I said, looking away.   
  
‚ÄúYou slept on the beach,‚Äù he stated.   
  
‚ÄúI have to go,‚Äù I said, pushing past him and walking out of the gym.   
  
Not sure where to go, I wandered downtown and found a coffee shop that was open.   
  
I went inside and took a seat at a table, where I ordered a coffee.  
  
I looked at my phone, which I decided to turn on, and saw dozens of messages and missed calls from Abel. The town was small enough that I knew he would find me eventually, so I had to be careful about where I stayed. I didn‚Äôt want to see him because I was afraid I'd lose my temper again. There are only so many times I can do that before someone calls the cops on me and gets me arrested.   
  
Honestly, I‚Äôm surprised it hasn‚Äôt happened yet.  
  
I checked how much money I had, and I realized I only had enough to pay for this coffee. Once I finished, I left the caf√© and headed to the park near the forest.   
  
By the time I arrived, storm clouds had started to roll in, and I couldn‚Äôt escape them. I tried to sit under a gazebo, but the wind was pushing the rain straight in at me.   
  
Feeling completely defeated, I sat there in the rain, staring off into space.   
  
‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt your mother ever tell you that you‚Äôll catch a cold if you stay out in the rain?‚Äù a guy asked. I turned around to find it was the same tattooed beauty from before.  
  
‚ÄúAre you stalking me?‚Äù I asked.  
  
‚ÄúI was walking by and saw you. And before you ask, I had football practice this morning, which is why I was heading to the locker room,‚Äù he said.    
  
‚ÄúCongratulations,‚Äù I replied, looking away from him.  
  
‚ÄúCome on, I‚Äôm not leaving you out here like this,‚Äù he insisted.    
  
‚ÄúWhere are we going?‚Äù I asked.    
  
‚ÄúMy house,‚Äù he said. I scoffed at the suggestion.    
  
‚ÄúDude, I don‚Äôt even know your name. Why would I go home with you?‚Äù I questioned.    
  
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Adam. Come on, Novalee,‚Äù he said, picking up my suitcase for me.    
  
I stared at him for a moment, but eventually, I got up and started walking beside him toward a residential area near the forest, not close to the town.",1,1746769957.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

No progress.,"So, last year I had an episode where I forced myself to throw up lidocaine because I thought I had inhaled it. The next day, I started feeling symptoms of my brain not working as it should. I felt spacey all of a sudden. At work, I noticed myself dozing off and feeling sleepy, especially in meetings. This happened regardless of whether I drank coffee or not. Heck, sometimes coffee seemed to exacerbate it. I also had difficulty breathing and mild pain in my RUQ, plus difficulty swallowing (felt like a sore throat / lump in my throat)

Primary care:

Bloodwork: OK (not sure about antibodies)


I was referred to a bunch of studies, from my primary care physician and a couple other specialists I've seen (neurologist, surgeon, etc.)

Echocardiogram: OK


Barium swallow test: OK


Pulmonary function test: OK


Brain MRI with contrast: OK


Sleep test: mild sleep apnea (started on CPAP in November, with pressure from 4 to 15 psi)


Endoscopy: hiatal hernia. I *just* had surgery for this very recently 


Neck X-Ray (taken at a hospital, NOT at a chiropractors office): OK


I also took lexapro (small dose) for a few months from the summer to December. 

I'm at a loss. Most of my symptoms have been fixed, *except* for my severe brain fog. I can hardly do arithmetic. I can barely read PowerPoint slides without feeling tired and dizzy. I can hardly read a book without yawning. I feel like I cannot concentrate. I wake up tired and have a permanent headache.

I don't know what to do. My neurologist described me as a challenging patient. My primary care physician believes it's all in my head.

1kib5g6,https://www.reddit.com/r/houseplants/comments/1kib5g6/seeking_advice_for_mass_repotting/,Seeking advice for mass repotting,"Hi friends, I've been lurking recently in my quest to save all of my plants and am seeking some insight.We need to repot all 18 (!!!) of our plants. My wife and I hastily did so a couple months ago, but we just used a regular soil mix for all of them and didn't know we were supposed to inspect the roots or any of the other considerations when repotting. We also put almost all of them into plastic pots because we liked the idea of sitting them in prettier pots and hadn't realized plastic isn't a great material for a lot of them. I have since done a deep dive and researched a TON about all of our plants, including making a spreadsheet, making lots of various notes and lists, and trying a handful of different apps. After all this, I'm mostly just really fatigued by all of the AI-generated information that is so hard to avoid and also impossible to trust. So I have a couple questions for you all, hoping and assuming you're real humans lol, to see if you can more quickly at least help me answer what I need to know before our Repotting Efforts this weekend, so tl;dr -¬†

1. What potting mixes or mix components should we buy to re-pot
2. What pots should we plant them in?

\#1 I'm waffling between buying like, a succulent mix, a fern mix, a regular mix, and some perlite to add drainage as needed, vs just getting coco coir (if it can just replace peat moss?), perlite, coarse sand, compost, and possibly some others (some of the plants had possibly wanted loamy soil \[maidenhair\], pine bark \[pothos, heartleaf philodendron, button fern\], garden soil \[asparagus\], and activated charcoal \[cylindrical snake\]) and making custom mixes for each plant instead. I imagine there are pros and cons of each, but I do worry about ending up with a huge amount of components or mixes that we don't need, since all 18 of our plants will be in 4-6"" pots so nothing huge to fill.

\#2 I'm struggling with the middle ground plants, figuring out whether they should be in terracotta or if I can still use some of the plastic or glazed clay pots we already have. I've separated the obvious (succulents, cacti) definitely terracotta plants and the possible terrarium/can be non-porous pot plants (ferns, pileas, string of frogs), but I'm trying to figure out what to do for the rest. We have hardly any terracotta so it just impacts how many I have to buy, lol. For reference, we live in the Pacific Northwest, so overwatering and underlighting are my biggest concerns. I'd love to not have to buy all new pots but I'll do what I gotta do.Below are our plants, with the info I have written down about what to get. Please tell me if anything sounds wrong to you or didn't work for you! I feel pretty solid on how big the pots will need to be, I'm just unsure about material, potting medium, depth, and soil amendments. All will have drainage holes so I'm not going to mention that every time, lol

1. Aloe Vera - terracotta, 5-6"" diameter,¬†shallow (2-3"" and/or same depth as width), either succulent/cacti potting mix or ratio of 1 peat moss/coco coir : 1 perlite : 1 coarse sand with a pH 6.0-8.5, may benefit from adding compost/worm compost and/or coffee grounds if pH is on the alkaline side
2. Aluminum Plant - possible terrarium plant? Otherwise can be in a non-porous pot, \~5"" diameter, unclear on depth, mix of 1 peat moss/coco coir : 1 perlite : 1 regular potting soil (whatever that means?) with a pH of 6-7, may benefit from adding compost or well-rotted manure as well
3. Asparagus Fern - terracotta, 5-6"" diameter, shallow, mix of 1 peat moss/coco coir : 1 perlite : 1 garden soil + a handful of coarse sand, pH 6.0-6.5, may benefit from adding compost as well
4. Blue Torch Cactus - terracotta, \~4"" diameter, shallow, mix of either 2 coarse sand : 2 perlite/pumice : 1 regular potting soil or 1 pine bark : 1 peat moss/coco coir : 1 coarse sand : 1 perlite? PH 6.0-7.3,¬†may benefit from added compost and/or coffee grounds occasionally?
5. Button Fern - possible terrarium plant, and this one is seriously suffering so he might not make it. If no terrarium, possibly a shallow non-porous pot, \~4"" diameter, with a mix of 1 peat moss/coco coir : 1 perlite : 1 pine bark (fines?), pH 5.5-7.0, could possibly benefit from adding compost?
6. Common Sage - terracotta, 5-6"" diameter, shallow ish?, mix of 2 regular potting soil : 1 perlite/pumice, pH 6.0-7.0, possibly add compost or worm castings?
7. Cylindrical Snake Plant - terracotta, \~4"" diameter, shallow, mix of 1 regular potting soil : 2 perlite : 1 coarse sand : 0.5 activated charcoal (optional?), pH 5.5-7.0, may benefit from one part compost or worm castings
8. Emerald Ripple Peperomia - terracotta? Could maybe be non-porous or even a terrarium but leaning toward a pot?¬†4-5"" diameter, shallow?, mix of 1-2 peat moss/coco coir : 1 perlite : 1 coarse sand, pH 6.0-6.6, haven't written down any soil amendments
9. Golden Pothos - possibly non-porous pot?, 5-6"" diameter, standard height, mix of 1 peat moss/coco coir : 1 perlite : 1 regular potting soil, add pine bark?, pH 6.1-6.5, no soil amendments written down
10. Golden Sedum - terracotta, 5-6"" diameter, shallow, succulent mix? No custom mix written down, no amendments written down
11. Heartleaf Philodendron - maybe non-porous pot?, \~5"" diameter, unclear on depth, mix of 2 peat moss/coco coir : 1 perlite : 1 pine bark, pH 5.5-6.5, possibly add compost or worm castings on top?
12. Jade - terracotta, 4-5"" diameter, shallow, mix of 2 regular potting soil : 1 perlite : 1 coarse sand, pH 6.0-7.0, possibly add worm castings?
13. Maidenhair Fern - possibly terrarium plant? She's not looking good so far. If in a pot, non-porous seemingly okay, \~4"" diameter, not too shallow, mix of 2 peat moss/coco coir : 1 perlite : 1 loamy soil(?), pH 6.0-7.0, possibly helpful to add compost or leaf mold(??)
14. Parallel Peperomia - terracotta? Could maybe be non-porous or even a terrarium but leaning toward a pot?, 5-6"" diameter, shallow?, mix of 1 peat moss/coco coir : 1 perlite : 1 coarse sand, pH 6.0-6.6, no amendments written down
15. Pilea Silver Sparkle - possible terrarium plant? If in a pot, seemingly any material okay?, \~4"" diameter, unclear on depth, mix of 1 peat moss/coco coir : 1 perlite, unclear on pH, unclear on amendments
16. Raindrop Peperomia - terracotta? Could maybe be non-porous or even a terrarium but leaning toward a pot?, 4-5"" diameter, shallow?, mix of 1 peat moss/coco coir : 1 perlite : 1 coarse sand, pH 6.0-6.6, unclear on amendments
17. Spiny Pincushion Cactus - terracotta, \~4"" diameter, shallow, succulent mix? No custom mix written, unclear on amendments
18. String of Frogs - terrarium? If not,¬† unclear on pot material, but \~4"" diameter, unclear on depth, mix of 1 regular potting soil : 1 peat moss/coco coir : 1 perlite, pH 6.0-7.5, possibly beneficial to add compost?

What do I do?,"I‚Äôve been at the top of my peer group for multiple performance cycles now by the way for client impact and teaming, so it‚Äôs not even a question about performance.

It‚Äôs because I come in every day, keep my head down and my mouth shut, and focus on methodically and carefully clearing all the items on my to-do list, before going home. I don‚Äôt check my phone very much during work hours and I really, really don‚Äôt like losing valuable minutes or hours on fucking around when there‚Äôs work to be done.

Yet people on my team who spend way more time gossiping, socializing, and catching up vs. being productive (a handful of them admitted they are like this btw) have better relationships with management and with each other than I do - I‚Äôve been left out of coffee/lunch runs and even impromptu lunches and dinners that partners/directors pull staff and seniors into, even when I‚Äôm sitting in earshot or in the direct line of sight. It‚Äôs like they fucking forget I exist when I contribute to the group‚Äôs performance just as much as anyone else. There are staff that joined quite recently who have better relationships with everyone on the team than I do - for example, we have a team event next week and multiple staff got sent the RSVP, but I didn‚Äôt get it until I pointed out I didn‚Äôt get the invite. 

I‚Äôm so frustrated that this keeps happening to me - it happened when I was an intern, in my two years as a staff, and now it‚Äôs happening to me as a senior. The firm bitches at us and bitches at us about how much engagement metrics and productivity and chargeable hours matter - so I took that to heart, and all I have to show for it is a team and management that forgets to include me in things on a regular basis.

You know what‚Äôs the saddest part about all of this? Outside of this major annoyance, I still get paid well and have very manageable hours; I even like the people on my team! I don‚Äôt hate any of them and find them all to be great people, but I really, really, really do not like being excluded. The anger that licks my insides when it happens is nuts. Nothing rubs me the wrong way more, regardless of whether it was an accident or not. I got excluded a lot when I was growing up and it really stuck with me.

Anyways - what do I do?

1kib064,https://www.reddit.com/r/IntltoUSA/comments/1kib064/my_post_about_f1_visa_interview_tips_is_one_of/,"My post about F-1 visa interview tips is one of the top results on Google and Reddit. Here's a former Yale lawyer's three-step guide to US student visa interviews and 214(b) rejections. (And why you shouldn't say ""I plan to return to my country""!)","TLDR: Three steps to a successful student visa interview:

1. Have a narrative that complies with the law.
2. Don‚Äôt memorize answers. Know your narrative.
3. Show up at your interview happy to be there.

This is a long post, but the tips work best when the underlying concepts are understood and taken together as a whole. I try to address all the most common questions students are asked: not scripts to follow, but *how to think about the question.*

# Introduction

I want to preface by saying I am a graduate of Yale Law School, but like many other YLS grads, I am not a practicing attorney. I have been doing college admissions consulting and visa interview preparation professionally for nearly a decade. I apply the principles I learned in law school and as a practicing litigator throughout the admissions process, from brainstorming essays to appealing financial aid awards to preparing students for visa interviews.

About two years ago, I wrote a Reddit [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IntltoUSA/comments/13qqb7b/ive_prepared_hundreds_of_students_for_their_f1/) with seven F-1 visa interview tips, and since then it‚Äôs become one of the top results on Google and Reddit when searching related terms. I get inquiries about F-1 visas every day, and I‚Äôve been privileged to meet aspiring students from dozens of countries all over the world and help them fill out their DS-160s and prepare for their interviews.

Several of the tips in my old post are based on lawyering techniques. This post is very law-oriented, but should not be construed as legal advice for any particular situation. Instead, I offer a perspective to **understand how immigration laws are interpreted and applied by visa officers**. I will also relate some personal anecdotes illustrating guidance on these principles.

I welcome comments and questions from students, parents, counselors, agents, lawyers, or anyone else. I‚Äôll try to answer when I can, although questions like ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs a good answer to the question \_\_\_\_?‚Äù or ‚Äúwhat should I answer if I‚Äôm asked \_\_\_\_?‚Äù are highly context-dependent, and I‚Äôm sometimes hesitant to give a public answer that might not be appropriate for all applicants.

# Step 1: Have a narrative that complies with the law.

When you plan to study in the United States, you need a *narrative.* A narrative is a story: why you‚Äôre pursuing a certain degree, how you came to enroll in the college/university, what you plan to do once you graduate, and how you intend to pay for your education. There‚Äôs not much else to it. But not everyone‚Äôs plan complies with the law. You need to make sure yours does.

As I‚Äôve noted before, visa officers are concerned predominantly with three questions:

1. Do you intend to comply with the terms of your visa while you‚Äôre studying (i.e. actually study and not work)?
2. Do you intend to immigrate?
3. Do you present a security threat to the United States?

**Every single question a visa officer asks you will be aimed at determining the answer to the above questions or discerning whether you are being truthful.** I will break down how to understand each issue and the pitfalls encountered by students that cause visas to be rejected under 214(b).

## Issue 1: Do you intend to comply with the terms of your visa while you‚Äôre studying (i.e. actually study and not work)?

### A. Questions relating to financial resources

This one is pretty simple. Students without adequate financial resources are more likely to make up for a shortfall by working illegally. In order to issue you an I-20, a college or university must obtain certification that you have the financial resources to secure a full academic year of study (if the program is a year or more). However, **a visa officer will want to be assured that you can afford the whole cost of attendance throughout your program.** You don‚Äôt need to have liquid assets that can cover all four years, but income and other assets reassure the visa officer that you won‚Äôt have any issues. Visa officers rarely ask for financial documentation. It‚Äôs a good idea to have it, but **the important thing is to go into the interview confident that you have the funds,** not obsessing over whether you have the right kinds of bank statements. Students and parents often ask ‚Äúwhat do I need to show?‚Äù The answer is that **you don‚Äôt** ***need*** **to show anything‚Äîyou need to convince the visa officer you can afford your program**. The more confident you are, the less likely you'll be asked for financial documents in the first place.

As I‚Äôve discussed before, **It‚Äôs usually not a good idea to mention income or assets unless asked.** There might be an exception if you or your sponsor has a truly large amount of financial resources (my rule of thumb would be liquid savings and investments amounting to double the total cost of attendance or income amounting to five times the annual cost of attendance), but in general you should not volunteer information about finances. If it‚Äôs a concern, the visa officer will ask. I‚Äôve seen situations in which a VO seems to assume a professional such as a lawyer or dentist makes a high income in some country, even if that‚Äôs not necessarily the case. Don‚Äôt score an ‚Äúown-goal‚Äù by undermining that assumption.

### B. Questions relating to your choice of major

This includes not just why you chose the major, but **whether you‚Äôre actually familiar with the subject matter.** I‚Äôve noticed questions like this with increasing frequency. Students who intend to work in a field unrelated to their intended area of study are less likely to be familiar with that area of study.

In the past week, I dealt with cases of two students who wanted to study computer science: one from Southeast Asia and one from South Asia. The one from Southeast Asia had told the visa officer they hadn‚Äôt studied computer science outside school, and when asked what languages they knew, they answered that they knew some Python. The visa officer followed up with ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs an IDE in Python?‚Äù The student didn‚Äôt know, and their visa was denied immediately. I asked the same question to the South Asian student in a mock interview, and they were surprised by the question but knew the answer right away.

**Graduate students are more likely to face these questions.** Another student I prepared recently was applying for a Ph.D in physics. The visa officer actually asked about fundamental particles that carry the weak nuclear force, and then asked the difference between particle physics and metaphysics. The student explained that metaphysics is actually a concept in philosophy, not physics! They were granted a visa soon after.

Questions about your major may also be relevant to your plans to develop weapons technology for a foreign country (see **Issue 3** below).

### C. Questions relating to the school and program you‚Äôre attending

Visa officers frequently ask, ‚Äúwhere will you be attending university?‚Äù This might seem like an odd question, because the name of your university and its location are printed on your I-20 right in front of them. **But they‚Äôre not asking because they want to know. They‚Äôre asking to see if** ***you*** **know.** Students will sometimes follow the advice of agents and know very little about the school, including how the name of the school is pronounced! I once encountered a student who told me they were going to attend ‚ÄúSaint Louie University‚Äù (it‚Äôs pronounced ‚ÄúSaint Lewis‚Äù). Those are immediate red flags.

There are schools that are essentially ‚Äúdiploma mills‚Äù and some legitimate universities that are less academically rigorous, for which attending those is more conducive to working when not in class. It‚Äôs assumed that a student will try to maintain their academic status, and that students at more academically rigorous schools will need to focus more on their studies. This is where a school‚Äôs reputation (sometimes unfairly) comes into play. **Less selective schools are perceived to be less academically rigorous, which means they may be attractive to foreigners who actually want to work in the US during their studies.** But note that there are schools that have high acceptance rates and are considered academically rigorous, which will have low graduation rates (which is a problem too, but not as bad).

Getting into college is easy; getting into a selective college is not. **Visa officers are more likely to think that a student who went through the trouble of taking the SAT/ACT/GRE, writing application essays, etc. is serious about studying.** A student who just followed the recommendation of an agent who gets paid by the schools in which their students enroll is more likely to be following a different path.

### D. How to answer ‚Äúwhy this school‚Äù?

**The visa interview is not an admissions interview. It‚Äôs not illegal to attend a school that lacks prestige or is lower-ranked, and it won‚Äôt ruin your chances at getting a visa to acknowledge that.** Those schools are authorized to issue I-20s and enroll international students by the US State Department. **But it is illegal to lie.** You should not pretend that a college is better than it is. Affordability and value for money are perfectly valid reasons for choosing a college, even if it doesn‚Äôt have a highly ranked program. And **you shouldn‚Äôt talk about the location or campus resources unless they were actually a major factor in your decision.** Here are some examples of common but unhelpful answers:

Last week I was prepping a student who chose the University of Illinois at Chicago over Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh because they didn‚Äôt get a scholarship at CMU (a very expensive school) as hoped. During our mock interview, I asked why they chose UIC over CMU. They started talking about how Chicago had ‚Äúbetter infrastructure‚Äù than Pittsburgh. I asked, ‚Äúif CMU cost the exact same as UIC, would you have chosen CMU?‚Äù and they answered ‚Äúyes.‚Äù I replied, ‚Äúso you lied.‚Äù I explained that no visa officer is going to believe that a student cares whether water from Lake Michigan needs less treatment than water from the Ohio River, or whether they think elevated trains are more useful than cable cars. **The answer this student had prepared sounded like a rehearsed essay and did not reflect the real reason for choosing their university.**

Just yesterday, a student who got into one liberal arts college and no other schools they could afford told me about the college‚Äôs small class sizes and flexible curriculum. I asked: ‚Äúif the school enrolled 20,000 students and every class had 100 students or more, would you still go?‚Äù The student said ‚Äúyes.‚Äù **The answer about small class sizes was a lie‚Äînot because it‚Äôs false, but because it wasn‚Äôt actually a reason they applied or accepted their offer.**

Recently, an aspiring CS student from South Asia told me in a mock interview that they wanted to attend City College of Seattle because of Seattle‚Äôs ‚Äúcoffee culture.‚Äù **It was patently silly.**

These things might be relevant to mention in an admissions essay or interview, as they are factors that would affect one‚Äôs decision given multiple attractive options, and many colleges care about personality ‚Äúfit.‚Äù Visa officers care about ‚Äúfit‚Äù in a different way: **does it fit your academic and career goals?**

One of my previous tips was ‚Äúknow the strengths of your program.‚Äù **But it‚Äôs important to also know the** ***weaknesses of your program.*** Last year, a study-abroad agent from a South Asian country reached out to me for help. Their students had a visa approval rate of about 50%, and they were looking for my help to prep their students and improve that figure. I told this agent that I noticed students who were accepted to schools like Eastern Michigan University, University of North Texas, and Western Carolina University (schools this agent‚Äôs students had been admitted to) describing their programs as ‚Äúhighly ranked‚Äù and ‚Äúrenowned‚Äù in areas like computer science and business. I asked whether students were saying this because (a) they understand that those are less prestigious programs, but that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre telling them visa officers want to hear; or (b) that‚Äôs what they actually think because you‚Äôre telling them that they‚Äôre prestigious programs. The agent admitted that it was the latter. **They were misleading students.**

I explained that if I were going to prep the agent‚Äôs students for interviews, I would explain the relative prestige and strengths of these programs, and that rankings they see may not be based on impartial facts (and are often produced by the school itself for marketing purposes). The agent ghosted me and never followed up. They apparently would rather their clients continue to think that they were being admitted to ‚Äúrenowned‚Äù universities than increase their chances at visa approval!

### E. Questions relating to the schools you applied to

This one is also pretty simple: visa officers want to know **if the programs you applied to reflect logical choices based on your educational and professional goals.** Students who just want a visa and nothing else are more likely to apply to just one or a few non-selective places, and might prioritize price over anything else. After all, why waste admission fees when your school representative or local agent assured you of admission?

A few weeks ago, I met with a student from West Africa who had an admission to a business program at a for-profit college. They applied there because it was the first result of a Google search and sounded good for them, and they hadn‚Äôt applied anywhere else. The student had not even heard of Babson College, Michigan State University, or Arizona State University. I explained that applying to a single for-profit college is not what someone who actually wants the best possible education does. Their decision to apply was based on Google ads and/or some dubious SEO-driven ‚Äúranking‚Äù article. If they were going to pursue a visa to attend this university, they would need to have a reasonable explanation for their selection process. In other words, their narrative was questionable.

### F. Questions about family in the US

Many students think these questions are primarily about immigration intent (and they can be), but they may also be about financial support and emergencies. **It‚Äôs not an automatic red flag to have a relative in the United States, even one who is a citizen or green-card holder.** I see students nervous about these family members being inquired about. But that nervousness is what visa officers are looking for. Be forthcoming about the situation, and you‚Äôre likely to have fewer problems.

Last year I had a student from a West African country come to me for help after their visa was rejected. They were going to an engineering school in a borough of New York City and would be living with a relative in another borough. As soon as it came up that the student would be living with the relative, their visa was denied. The most common advice to this student might be to find another sponsor, get admission to a different program (perhaps far from the relative), or just give up. But I didn‚Äôt think they needed to do any of that. **To me, their narrative made sense. They just needed to help the visa officer understand.**

To prepare this student for their second interview, I told them that when asked ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs changed since last time?‚Äù they could answer ‚Äúmy circumstances haven‚Äôt changed, but I feel I did not get a chance to adequately explain my living situation.‚Äù We prepared an answer, which the student gave, explaining how they would be living with the relative and commuting on the subway to classes, but taking all meals at the relative‚Äôs house, and would be focusing on their studies. **The visa officer actually smiled at that answer‚Äîit‚Äôs not something applicants usually say‚Äîand the student from West Africa got the visa after a previous refusal.**

This anecdote means that the question about the living situation likely had nothing to do with immigration intent. I correctly deduced that the visa officer was concerned that the student was actually going to work for their relative‚Äôs business, which is very common for people who come on F-1 visas. We worked on delivering answers **confidently reassuring the visa officer that the student‚Äôs activities would comply with the law.**

## Issue 2: Do you intend to immigrate?

This is the issue that gets the most attention because it‚Äôs the most commonly cited reason for rejection. It is the least understood‚Äìboth the law itself and how it‚Äôs enforced. This is because the rules are different for tourist visas and student visas!

### A. What most people think the law says

Embassies generally have two 214(b) rejection slips. One includes the following:

>You have not demonstrated that you have the ties that will compel you to return to your home country after your travel to the United States.

Many agents, consultants, and even lawyers advise students to focus on establishing ties to one‚Äôs home country on their DS-160 forms and during their interviews. **This is good advice for tourist and business visas, but not usually for student visas.** Also, when I read interview transcripts and conduct mock interviews, I frequently encounter the phrase ‚ÄúI plan to return to my country.‚Äù In my opinion, this is not the right approach, and from my observations, often backfires. In fact, I think it‚Äôs problematic for several reasons, which I will get to.

### B. What the law says

This is what 214(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C 1101 *et seq.*) actually says:

>**Every alien** (other than a nonimmigrant described in subparagraph (L) or (V) of section 101(a)(15), and other than a nonimmigrant described in any provision of section 101(a)(15)(H)(i) except subclause (b1) of such section) **shall be presumed to be an immigrant until he establishes to the satisfaction of the consular officer**, at the time of application for a visa, and the immigration officers, at the time of application for admission, **that he is entitled to a nonimmigrant status** *under section 101(a)(15)*.

**‚ÄúShall be presumed‚Äù is a legally relevant phrase** meaning the burden is on the applicant to convince the visa officer that they don‚Äôt have immigration intent. The most famous legal ‚Äúpresumption‚Äù in American law is the presumption of innocence until proven guilty. In a criminal case, the burden of proof is always ‚Äúbeyond a reasonable doubt.‚Äù The defendant doesn‚Äôt need to prove their innocence. If the prosecution presents no evidence, or even if the prosecution merely proves the defendant more likely committed the crime than not, the accused cannot be convicted. This is the highest burden of proof in the US legal system. Other less demanding burdens of proof in legal proceedings include ‚Äúclear and convincing evidence‚Äù (e.g. for termination of parental rights) and ‚Äúpreponderance of the evidence‚Äù (in most civil cases).

What‚Äôs the burden of proof in a visa application? ‚Äú**To the satisfaction of the consular officer**.‚Äù It‚Äôs one of the most subjective burdens of proof, and can be anywhere from extremely easy to impossibly difficult to meet. It depends on individual judgment, and outcomes may differ even when presenting the same evidence. And because visa officers‚Äô decisions cannot be appealed, there isn‚Äôt a lot of case law on it (but we‚Äôll get to that).

This is what section 101(a)(15), to which 214(b) refers, says:

>an alien having a residence in a foreign country which he has no intention of abandoning, who is a bona fide student qualified to pursue a full course of study and who seeks to enter the United States temporarily and solely for the purpose of pursuing such a course of study.

Note immediately that it says ‚Äú*a* foreign country.‚Äù **Many students believe that the law requires them to establish ties to their country of citizenship. They don‚Äôt.**

**So what about students who are just temporary residents or visa-holders in the countries where they live, and their residency status will end when they leave the country, turn a certain age, or their sponsoring parent loses status?** For example, there are many Indian citizens born and living in the UAE whose parents have been on guest worker visas their kids‚Äô entire lives. The children don‚Äôt have any home in India, and they would need their own visas to return to the UAE after graduation. There‚Äôs no way they can have ‚Äúa residence in a foreign country‚Äù which they have ‚Äúno intention of abandoning,‚Äù and they may not even have one at all! So, **according to the strict letter of the law, there should be no legal way to get a visa. Yet it happens regularly.** I‚Äôve worked with several such families, and every student has gotten a visa with no problem.

### C. What‚Äôs really going on

The ‚Äúreal‚Äù rules (the ones that matter most to applicants) are not the 214(b) rejection slip or even 214(b) itself. They‚Äôre in the [**Foreign Affairs Manual**](https://fam.state.gov/), which is the State Department‚Äôs set of directives for consular officials.‚ÄØLet‚Äôs take a look [9‚ÄØFAM‚ÄØ402.5‚Äë5(E)](https://fam.state.gov/FAM/09FAM/09FAM040205.html) (emphasis added):

>**Adjudicating student visa applications differs from those of other short-term visitors in that the residence-abroad requirement should be looked at differently.** Typically, students lack the strong economic and social ties of more established visa applicants, and they plan longer stays in the United States. The statute assumes that **the natural circumstances of being a student do not disqualify the applicant from qualifying for a student visa. You should consider the applicant‚Äôs** ***present intent*** **in determining visa eligibility, not what they might do after a lengthy stay in the United States.**

>If a student visa applicant is residing with parents or guardians, they are maintaining a residence abroad if you are satisfied that the applicant has the present intent to depart the United States at the conclusion of their studies. **The fact that this intention may change is not sufficient reason to deny a visa.** In addition, **the present intent to depart does not imply the need to return to the country from which they hold a passport.** It means only that they must intend to leave the United States upon completion of their studies. Given that most student visa applicants are young, **they are not expected to have a long-range plan and may not be able to fully explain their plans at the conclusion of their studies.** You must be satisfied when adjudicating the application that the applicant possesses the **present intent to depart** at the conclusion of their approved activities.

>**The fact that a student‚Äôs proposed education or training would not appear to be useful in their homeland is not a basis for refusing an F-1 or M-1 visa.** This remains true even if the applicant‚Äôs proposed course of study seems to be impractical. For example, if a student visa applicant from a developing country wishes to study nuclear engineering simply because they enjoy it, they may no more be denied a visa because there is no market for a nuclear engineer‚Äôs skills in their homeland than they may be denied a visa for the study of philosophy or Greek simply because they do not lead to a specific vocation.

>**The fact that education or training like that which the applicant plans to undertake is apparently available in their home country is not in itself a basis for refusing a student visa.  An applicant may legitimately seek to study in the United States for various reasons, including a higher standard of education or training.** Furthermore, the desired education or training in the applicant‚Äôs homeland may be only theoretically available; openings in local schools and institutions may be already filled or reserved for others.

I‚Äôll note here that even though the absence of career opportunities or presence of educational opportunities in your country *alone* are not a reason to *reject* a visa, a convincing narrative involving future career opportunities and/or lack of education options in your country can be a good reason to *grant* you a visa!

#### Why does the 214(b) rejection slip not say any of this?

The text of the two 214(b) rejection slips (for not demonstrating ties, or for reasons other than not demonstrating ties) is actually found in the Foreign Affairs Manual too ([9 FAM 403.10-3(A)(3)](https://fam.state.gov/fam/09FAM/09FAM040310.html#M403_10). Visa officers are trained to hand applicants the slip, but **the meaning of the law as applied to students is actually much different than the meaning of the law as applied to other non-immigrant visa applicants.** There‚Äôs just no special rejection slip for students.

### D. Case law

There isn‚Äôt a lot of case law on the issue, but various judicial opinions on other non-immigrant visas distinguish between *wanting* to immigrate and *intending* to stay in the United States. **Courts don‚Äôt see expressing a** ***desire*** **to move to the US as automatically disqualifying.** See, e.g., *Lauvik‚ÄØv.‚ÄØINS*, 910‚ÄØF.2d‚ÄØ658‚ÄØ(9th‚ÄØCir.‚ÄØ1990); *Brownell‚ÄØv.‚ÄØCarija*, 254‚ÄØF.2d‚ÄØ78‚ÄØ(D.C.‚ÄØCir.‚ÄØ1957); [*Matter of Chartier*‚ÄØ(BIA‚ÄØ1977)](https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/eoir/legacy/2012/08/17/2602.pdf). (I still don‚Äôt recommend telling a visa officer that your hope is to immigrate.)

A court has ruled (overturning a previous opinion) that a student who later filed for permanent residence could not be deported on the basis of having immigration intent. [Hosseinpour‚ÄØv.‚ÄØINS,‚ÄØ520‚ÄØF.2d‚ÄØ941 (5th‚ÄØCir. 1975)](https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/eoir/legacy/2012/08/17/2349.pdf)

### E. The role of the interview in a legal framework

If student visas can be granted to some applicants without an interview, then it can‚Äôt be the case that presenting evidence at an interview is necessary. **Simply being enrolled at a reputable university can be evidence that one actually intends to study.** The [country of origin and/or nationality](https://www.reddit.com/r/IntltoUSA/comments/1d4mcbl/passing_the_f1_visa_interview_why_your_country/) can also affect the visa officer‚Äôs perception of immigration intent. The VO can decide that someone coming from a developed country doesn‚Äôt have immigration intent. And yes, prejudices (both positive and negative) come into play. But the law is very flexible: all that‚Äôs required is for the visa officer to be ‚Äúsatisf\[ied\].‚Äù

Depending on your circumstances, you may not have to worry about the presumption of immigration intent at all. I‚Äôve had multiple students with European passports get their visas approved after one or two questions about the university or college they‚Äôre attending (including community college). One of those students was a UK citizen but who grew up and was living in a West African country and spoke in a strong West African French accent. Their interview was about 30 seconds long before they were approved.

In general, **students from countries that have visa-free or visa-on-arrival privileges will have an easier time with student visas**, although this is not guaranteed. The assumption is that if they wanted to enter and remain in the United States permanently, they would just hop on a plane, enter, and disappear. Indeed, that is how a significant proportion of illegal immigration happens. Someone who has an easier path wouldn‚Äôt go through the process of obtaining admission for a university (particularly a selective one) and register for SEVIS, which allows the government to track them more closely than other visitors.

### F. Questions about continuing your studies after graduation

I‚Äôd like to point out that the Foreign Affairs Manual says ‚Äúat the conclusion of their studies‚Äù (twice), ‚Äúupon completion of their studies,‚Äù and ‚Äúupon completion of their approved activities.‚Äù It does *not* say ‚Äúupon completion of their *program*.‚Äù **Intent to pursue further studies in the United States is fine, and you don‚Äôt need to pretend otherwise** (which often strains credulity). However, I recommend stating that you would attend the program best suited to your interests and goals wherever that may be, rather than planning *specifically* to stay in the US.

### G. What‚Äôs wrong with ‚ÄúI plan to return to my country‚Äù?

1. It‚Äôs often not true. The Foreign Affairs Manual does say that the availability of jobs in your home country *alone* shouldn‚Äôt be a factor, but it can be a significant factor. Individuals from wealthy families will have an easier time with this, but those who are clearly depending on their education to generate income need to have a plan that makes sense. 

2. Even if it‚Äôs true, it can sound insincere. You don‚Äôt actually need to return to your country, but people think you do because of what‚Äôs written on the 214(b) rejection slip. It can sound like words the visa officer thinks you want them to hear and come off very rehearsed. 

3. It can sound strange. Most often, visa interviews are conducted in one‚Äôs home country. It‚Äôs just odd to say ‚Äúmy country‚Äù or ‚Äúmy home country‚Äù when you‚Äôre already there. In normal conversation, you would say ‚ÄúI want to come back here‚Äù or maybe name the country. (‚ÄúI want to come back here to India.‚Äù) Again, these are not the ‚Äúmagic words‚Äù you think they are, and they can be used against you.

**Sometimes ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure where I‚Äôll end up, but I‚Äôll leave the United States‚Äù might be a better answer than starting with ‚ÄúI will return to my country.‚Äù** *Note that this applies only to students, not tourists or other non-immigrant visas.*

# Issue 3: Do you pose a security threat to the United States?

I‚Äôm not going to go into detail on this issue, as these questions rarely come up in interviews, and background vetting is usually done beforehand. But this is meant to be a comprehensive guide, so I‚Äôll mention the major issues.

## A. Political activities

Given the current political situation, you need to be prepared to answer questions about your associations and events you‚Äôve attended.

## B. Social media

I guide students on social media use, but when I try to write about problematic topics to avoid, my posts get caught in Reddit‚Äôs filters. And given social media monitoring, questions about political activities and social media posts are best suited to private conversation protected by end-to-end encryption. (This does **not** include Reddit messages or DMs.) When students message me about these questions, I will direct them to my Telegram. (WhatsApp is also encrypted and is acceptable, but ads generated from message content will find their way into the Meta ad network.)

## C. Your study plans and weapons development

In 2002, the US government made it explicitly prohibited for immigration officers to allow students to enter if they were likely to export weapons technology, and published a [Technology Alert List](https://www.bu.edu/isso/files/pdf/tal.pdf) of fields of study that could be used for weapons. This is a long list, and obviously studying many of the areas (urban planning, aerospace) doesn‚Äôt disqualify you from a visa. (The FAM even lists ‚Äúnuclear engineering‚Äù as an example of a field a student is allowed to study even if their country doesn‚Äôt use nuclear energy!) The important thing is that you‚Äôre not learning how to develop weapons, hack into institutional computer systems, or otherwise help another country threaten the security of the U.S.

# Step 2. Don‚Äôt memorize answers. Know your narrative.

It‚Äôs not a secret that most students who study in the United States would like to get jobs there. There are still unparalleled opportunities, and the United States is home to most of the world‚Äôs most valuable startups and tech companies. I talk about that a bit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1k7powe/comment/mp0017p/).

It‚Äôs illegal to lie about past experiences and current facts. **It‚Äôs not illegal to change your mind in the future.** For a successful interview, you need to have a **narrative that makes sense, with your educational program a logical part of that narrative.** The key to succeeding in your visa interview is not to memorize ‚Äúacceptable‚Äù answers that avoid red flags. You need to have a concrete plan and convince yourself that your intent is to leave after your studies. And it‚Äôs very helpful that **the actual requirement is not that you have to return to your home country, because that opens up many more possibilities.**

**Once you have a goal that‚Äôs plausible, you need to work out the details.** In particular, does your decision to pursue education in the US make financial sense? If you‚Äôre staying in the same industry, will you recoup the cost of your investment within a few years? If you‚Äôre changing industries, will entry-level jobs be available when you graduate, or will you have resources to build a business as an entrepreneur? You don‚Äôt need to practice answering these questions over and over, but you should know the answers. If you do, you‚Äôll be able to answer confidently. As long as your plan complies with the law, you‚Äôll have nothing to worry about.

If you don‚Äôt know the answer to a particular question, that‚Äôs (usually) okay, as long as you have the basics covered. Not everyone knows every detail about their plans. Making up the answer to a question you don‚Äôt know the answer to is almost always much worse.

**Telling a visa officer a plan that‚Äôs unlikely to happen but is still plausible is not a lie.** You need a credible plan that involves departing the United States. But most students don‚Äôt have this, or they don‚Äôt say it like they mean it. All they have is a rehearsed ‚ÄúI plan to return to my country and x.‚Äù

This touches on my previous advice not to sound rehearsed. ‚ÄúDiagnosing‚Äù an interview based on a transcript is of limited use. To determine what the major problems are, I have to understand how an interviewee interacted with the visa officer and delivered their answers.

# Step 3: Show up to your interview happy to be there

One of the reasons I think my admissions students have been 100% successful getting their visas is that they‚Äôre happy to be going through an interview, the final step in a long and sometimes arduous process.

Visa officers will look for signs of discomfort and deception. It‚Äôs fine to be a little nervous, but if you‚Äôre more delighted than nervous, you will put the visa officer in a good mood. That‚Äôs one reason I advise being polite but not obsequious. **You want to sound confident, not desperate.** To use a GenZ term, try to ‚Äúmanifest‚Äù and imagine being granted your visa. I‚Äôm not a therapist, but sometimes the most impactful thing I do for students is to put their minds at ease and help them set aside feelings of dread that all their time, efforts, and money could go to waste.

1kiazfn,https://www.reddit.com/r/phlgbt/comments/1kiazfn/a_love_story_almost/,A Love Story... almost,"Circa 2005. I thought I had all the signs. The lingering touches, the late night texts, the way his camera always seemed to find me when I wasn‚Äôt looking. But the universe had one cruel twist waiting for me‚Äîand it happened in the middle of a crowded mall, with an arcade game blaring in the background and my heart shattering in silence.

During university, I joined the school paper, where I met Sonny‚Äîa photography guy with an easy smile and a knack for making stressful deadlines feel like an adventure. We were assigned to cover the intramurals together: me writing, him shooting photos and designing the daily newsletter.  

What was supposed to be a routine task turned into five straight days of chaos, caffeine, and stolen moments. We‚Äôd huddle in the publication office until midnight, racing against the clock to finish each issue. Some nights, we were so exhausted we crashed on the floor in sleeping bags, too tired to go home. But in between the chaos, something unexpected happened.  

Sonny had a way of blurring the line between friendly and something more. He‚Äôd rest his head on my shoulder when he was tired.  He‚Äôd sneak photos of me when he thought I wasn‚Äôt looking.  He‚Äôd bring me coffee‚Äîalways remembering how I liked it‚Äîand sometimes, when I was typing furiously, his hands would land on my shoulders, kneading away the stress with a touch that lingered just a second too long.  Our eyes would meet, and we‚Äôd both laugh for no reason.  

On the last night of the intramurals, after the final newsletter was sent to print, we stayed behind, reluctant to let the week end. That night, as we lay side by side in the dim glow of the office computers, he pulled me into a hug‚Äîsoft, hesitant, but unmistakably tender. He said he is going to miss me, but I didn‚Äôt trust myself to speak. My heart was hammering so loud I was sure he could hear it.  

After the intramurals, we didn‚Äôt have a reason to see each other every day‚Äîbut I found excuses anyway.  Are you on campus? Want to grab lunch? Can‚Äôt sleep, up for a late-night texting. He always said yes.  

We‚Äôd talk for hours‚Äîabout school, dreams, the kind of deep conversations that made me feel like he saw me in a way no one else did. Our mutual friend Rudy teased us, calling us couples in a joking tone. I‚Äôd laugh it off, but inside, I was already drafting my confession in my head. 

This is it, I thought. He feels it too. I decided I‚Äôd tell him my true feelings for him after finals.  I was so excited, imagining how amazing my term break would be with my heart finally out in the open.

The last day of finals arrived, and we were all in high spirits after our calculus exam went better than expected. To celebrate, a group of friends suggested we go to the mall ‚Äî arcade games, greasy food, the works. I was floating on adrenaline, giddy with the thought that soon, I‚Äôd finally tell Sonny how I felt.  

And then, as if the universe had a sick sense of humor, I saw him. 

I called out, smiling, and he turned‚Äîjust as a girl rushed to his side, threading her fingers through his. He introduced her as his girlfriend.  She went to school in another city. She was just visiting. They‚Äôd been together for how long? Why did he not tell me?

I don‚Äôt remember what I said. Probably something polite before I walked away, my face burning, my chest caving in. The worst part? I couldn‚Äôt even react. Not when my friends were cheering about our exams being over. Not when we were supposed to be having fun. So I laughed. I played arcade games. I pretended my heart wasn‚Äôt breaking in real time.  

That night, I cried into my pillow, replaying every moment‚Äîevery touch, every late-night texts, every time he made me feel like I was special. Had I imagined it all? Or worse‚Äîhad he known exactly what he was doing?  

It took me years to realize this. Sometimes, people don‚Äôt mean to hurt you. Sometimes, they‚Äôre just careless with hearts they never intended to keep. And sometimes, the hardest heartbreaks aren‚Äôt the ones that happen in dramatic confrontations‚Äîbut the ones you have to bury under a smile because no one even knows you‚Äôre bleeding.

I became a ""bad apple"" at the age of 24. Before that, I was a good person. But I started meeting new people who were using drugs.

Back then, I used to love going to the gym every day. I was a gym rat, proud of how my body looked, and I was one of the strongest people at that gym. I‚Äôd show off, especially when this one girl was there‚Äîmy gym crush. I saw her most days, and to me, she was beautiful. She didn‚Äôt even know me, but I knew her. I‚Äôd talk to myself about her, daydreaming about saying hi one day‚Ä¶ but I never did. I was too shy.

Instead, I‚Äôd lift heavier weights, hoping to get her attention. It never worked. But hey, if you go to the gym today, you¬†*need*¬†a gym crush‚Äîback then, it wasn‚Äôt a thing. Now it is.

**My Routine**

I worked 10 hours a day, then hit the gym for 2‚Äì3 hours, five times a week. But on Fridays, starting at 9 PM, everything changed. I‚Äôd hang around people who drank all night and used drugs.

I didn‚Äôt even like the drugs that much‚Äîit was the¬†*environment*¬†I loved. If I got bored in the middle of the night, I could always find someone to party with. If you‚Äôve never been out late, you don‚Äôt know the half of it. The things that happen‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs crazy. There‚Äôs a whole secret life people live after dark, and for a while, I was one of them.

**""Drugs, Sex, and Violence""**

Violence was never my thing‚Äîbut drugs and sex? Those were the two biggest problems in my life. And yeah, women‚Ä¶ they‚Äôll get you cut up. That‚Äôs just how it goes.

I always knew the party would have to end someday. I just didn‚Äôt expect it to happen because of a girl.

**The Night That Changed Everything**

It was Thanksgiving weekend. I‚Äôd been drinking and smoking at a motel with a girl‚Äîlet‚Äôs not name names. After a while, I decided to head home.

As I drove off, I noticed some jewelry in my car that belonged to her. Even drunk and high, I figured I should do the right thing and return it. So I turned around.

That‚Äôs when I saw the patrol car in my rearview mirror.

I panicked. I was wasted, buzzing off controlled substances, and now flashing lights were on my tail. I pulled into a nearby gas station, bailed out of the car, and started walking back toward the girl‚Äôs motel room.

Bad move.

I hadn‚Äôt even made it to the corner before three patrol cars boxed me in. They cuffed me right there‚Äîno surprise, I was obviously messed up. They ran a drug test, and‚Ä¶ yeah, you guessed it. I wasn‚Äôt clean.

Then came the offer:¬†*""We know where you were going. Give us information, and this never happened. Walk away free.""*

I played dumb.¬†*""I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about.""*

Eight hours in a cell later, they cut me loose with a court date and a promise:¬†*""See you in front of the judge for that DUI.""*

**The Aftermath**

I went home and pretended everything was fine, celebrating Thanksgiving with my family like nothing had happened. But in the back of my mind, I knew my court date was looming.

Life went on‚Äîwork, gym, the usual routine. I even saw my old gym crush a few times. Still too shy to say hi, just like before. Funny how some things never change. I miss her to this day. Sometimes I‚Äôll spot one of her family members around town, but never her. It‚Äôs like she vanished.

When court day finally arrived, there were no surprises. The test results came back dirty, just like we all knew they would. The judge didn‚Äôt hesitate‚Äîhe sentenced me to a one-year rehabilitation program.

No more parties. No more late-night chaos. Just me, my mistakes, and a year to figure out who I really was without the drugs, the drinking, or the girl who got me caught.

**The Rehab Trap**

They call it rehabilitation, but really? It's a system designed to make you fail.

Here's how it works:

* Call in¬†**5 days a week**. Miss one?¬†**Warrant issued.**
* Drug tests¬†**2-3 times weekly**. Can't pay the $40 fee?¬†**That's a fail.**
* Mandatory classes¬†**3 times a week**. No money?¬†**Can't attend.**¬†That's another¬†**violation.**

How the hell are you supposed to pay for all this when having a record means¬†**no one will hire you?**¬†Most guys end up back in jail within weeks.

I got lucky. Somehow, I kept my job. Nobody found out about the program, or the drugs, or the court order. Don't ask me how‚ÄîI still don't know. Maybe because I showed up sober every day, grinding through the motions while my paycheck bled out to drug tests and ""recovery"" classes.

The system's not built to help you. It's built to¬†**keep you circling the drain.**

**The Last Goodbye**

Eight months into the program, my work vacation was coming up‚Äîa full month off. Every year, I'd spend it in Mexico visiting family, especially my grandmother on my mom's side.

I went to my PO to ask permission for a two-week trip.

**Him:**¬†""No.""  
**Me:**¬†Explaining about my aging grandmother, how much she meant to me.  
**Him:**¬†After a long pause‚Äî""Fine. But when you come back, you restart the entire program from day one.""

There it was. The trap. I was doing everything right, but the system doesn't reward progress‚Äîit punishes hope.

I said yes.

That trip to Mexico was the last time I saw my grandmother alive. While the program stole eight months of my life, those two weeks gave me something priceless‚Äîa final embrace, her hands patting my face, her voice saying ""mi'jo"" one last time.

They made me restart rehab like I'd relapsed. But some things are worth resetting the clock for.

**Starting Over**

When I got back from Mexico, I went straight to the probation office like I'd promised. Ready to restart the rehab program from zero‚ÄîI'd made my peace with that.

But when I arrived, they hit me with another curveball:  
**""Your PO's on vacation. Someone else will handle your case today.""**

I sat in that plastic chair, watching the clock. Thirty minutes of fluorescent lights and stale coffee later, they finally called my name.

Turns out, the system doesn't just make you start over‚Äîit makes you wait. Makes you wonder. Makes you realize how little any of this is really about helping people.

¬†**The Unexpected Savior**

I walked into the office shaking, more embarrassed than I'd ever been in my life. I felt like have betrayed myself just by being there.

When I looked up, there she was - my gym crush, the one I'd never had the courage to speak to. Now she was sitting across from me as my probation officer.

""Hi,"" she said. ""What are you doing here?""

I couldn't speak. My mouth went dry. All I could do was point at my file on her desk.

She opened it and started reading. ""I see you were doing well... then you stopped showing up?""

I explained everything - my deal with my regular PO, my trip to Mexico to see my grandmother, the agreement to restart the program when I returned.

She looked at me. After a long moment, she said: ""I don't think you need to be in this program anymore.""

Just like that, the woman I'd been too afraid to say hello to became the one who gave me my second chance. She scheduled a court date and got me out of the program.

After that, I stopped going to the gym.  
Too embarrassed to face her.

That last time in the probation office?  
That was the final time I ever saw her.

John Harrison‚Äôs Worlds,"M. John Harrison writes books that don‚Äôt settle when you close them. They echo, shift, unravel. And I think that's exactly what makes them matter.

You don‚Äôt read Harrison for comfort. You read him for that uneasy recognition: Yes, this is how the world feels when you stop pretending it makes sense. His stories are riddles, but not the kind that get solved. They‚Äôre like dreams you only half remember, or moments of clarity that vanish when you try to explain them.

I started with Things That Never Happen, a short story collection that stretches across decades of his work, and it floored me. Every piece in it feels like a glimpse through a keyhole‚Äîbrief, intense, and slightly off-kilter. ‚ÄúEgnaro,‚Äù for instance, is about a secret country that may or may not exist. A man hears whispers of it, gets obsessed, tries to pin it down, and slowly loses himself in the search. But it‚Äôs not just about obsession. It‚Äôs about what happens when you realize the mystery is more meaningful than anything you‚Äôll find at the end of the road.

And then there‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Ice Monkey,‚Äù which broke something in me. A climbing accident, a friend lost, and that creeping frost of guilt that settles in the survivor. You think it's going to be a story about grief, and it is‚Äîbut also about how we keep circling the same emotional dead zones, never quite thawing out. ‚ÄúThe New Rays‚Äù is more grotesque‚Äîbody horror and psychological unraveling in a clean white clinical setting. It‚Äôs almost unbearable in how quietly it builds, how little comfort it gives.

Every story in that collection scratches at something hidden. ‚ÄúThe Incalling,‚Äù ‚ÄúRunning Down,‚Äù ‚ÄúSettling the World‚Äù‚Äîthey‚Äôre not just science fiction or fantasy or horror. They're states of mind. I read ‚ÄúOld Women‚Äù and laughed, then felt the laugh catch in my throat. Some of them are just a few pages long, but they linger like bad dreams.

And if those stories are dreamlike, then the Viriconium series is the dream itself. It starts with The Pastel City, which almost tricks you into thinking it‚Äôs going to be a normal fantasy: a decaying far-future city, elegant swordfighters, ancient machines. There‚Äôs even a quest of sorts. But already there‚Äôs something wrong‚Äîsomething in the texture of the world that refuses to cooperate.

Then A Storm of Wings pulls the rug out from under you. Reality starts to warp. Language falters. The city frays. Aliens arrive, but they‚Äôre not invaders in the usual sense‚Äîthey‚Äôre an infection of perception. And by In Viriconium, all the fantasy scaffolding is gone. There‚Äôs no plot, just disease and confusion and artists feuding as the world dies around them. It‚Äôs as if Harrison is showing you how the whole idea of fantasy‚Äîthe idea that the world can be explained, that it has a structure‚Äîis a kind of lie. And Viriconium Nights just explodes the whole thing. Every story contradicts the last. The city‚Äôs name changes. Its streets shift. It becomes impossible to say what‚Äôs real anymore. And isn‚Äôt that the point?

Some writers build worlds. Harrison dissolves them, lovingly.

He does the same thing in his science fiction, especially in the Kefahuchi Tract trilogy. Light, Nova Swing, Empty Space‚Äîthey‚Äôre not so much space operas as cosmic autopsies. In Light, we follow a physicist in the present day who might be a serial killer, a post-human pilot wired into her ship, and a spacefaring addict running from his past. Their stories orbit the Kefahuchi Tract, a tear in the universe where physics collapses and the past leaks into the future. It‚Äôs a place full of broken alien tech‚Äîghosts of civilizations that reached too far and vanished.

But again, it‚Äôs not really about the science. It‚Äôs about the damage people carry. The things they can‚Äôt let go of. How every attempt to escape ends up looping back to the same void inside. Nova Swing is noir in tone‚Äîtourists paying to enter the weird zone near the Tract, like thrill-seekers poking at the divine. Empty Space draws it all together in a kind of cosmic exhaustion: grief, recursion, the impossibility of closure.

And somewhere between Viriconium and the Kefahuchi Tract, there‚Äôs The Centauri Device‚Äîa novel that looks like a space opera, sounds like a space opera, but keeps unraveling the whole idea as you read it. The main character, John Truck, isn‚Äôt a hero‚Äîhe‚Äôs a burned-out drifter pulled into a galactic arms race just because of his bloodline. The titular device, capable of planetary annihilation, is less a MacGuffin than a symbol of how little control anyone actually has. It‚Äôs a brutal, cynical book, full of grimy ships, bored soldiers, and ideological noise‚Äîand it might be the most honest depiction of space war I‚Äôve ever read. Harrison doesn't celebrate the genre‚Äôs myths; he picks them apart and asks why we believed them in the first place.

Then there‚Äôs You Should Come With Me Now: Stories of Ghosts, a collection that feels like stepping into a fog of d√©j√† vu and waking dreams. These are short, often very short, but they linger like cold air in the lungs. A man walks into his own past. A building dissolves into metaphor. The real is constantly melting into the barely possible. If Things That Never Happen felt like a dismantling of genre, this feels like genre‚Äôs haunted residue, clinging to ordinary lives like shadows that won‚Äôt align with their objects.


And then there‚Äôs The Sunken Land Begins to Rise Again, which might be my favorite of all. It‚Äôs not part of any series, but it feels like a culmination‚Äîa quiet, eerie novel about two people drifting through a half-recognizable England where something is subtly, irreversibly wrong. Shaw is a man recently out of a breakdown; Victoria inherits her mother‚Äôs house and slowly uncovers a strange, amphibious mythology underneath the surface of everyday life. It‚Äôs a ghost story, maybe. Or a story about ecological collapse, or madness, or the way we fail to connect. Nothing in it is overt. There‚Äôs no climax, no answers. Just a sense that the land is remembering something we‚Äôve tried very hard to forget.

Harrison‚Äôs style is part of what makes all this work. His prose is exquisite‚Äînot in a showy way, but in how carefully it refuses to settle. He can describe a sky or a cup of coffee or a man unraveling his identity with the same stripped-down, surgical precision. And he‚Äôs suspicious‚Äîdeeply suspicious‚Äîof fantasy as a form of escapism. He once said that the purpose of fantasy should be to examine why we feel the need to escape in the first place. That‚Äôs what his books do. They don‚Äôt offer worlds to run to. They make you sit with where you are and what it means to live there.

They‚Äôre uncomfortable. They‚Äôre often sad. But they‚Äôre also staggeringly beautiful in how clearly they see the mess of being alive. You finish one, and you don‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôve ‚Äúgotten it.‚Äù You feel like it‚Äôs gotten you.

So if you're the kind of reader who likes tidy arcs, satisfying payoffs, or worldbuilding with footnotes, maybe steer clear. But if you're willing to wander‚Äîif you're drawn to stories that slip through your fingers even as they grip your heart‚Äîthen welcome. Harrison doesn‚Äôt promise meaning. But what he gives is deeper: a map of confusion, and the strange solace of knowing you're not alone in it.

**My MIL decided to gossip with my daughter about my marriage, blowing a giant hole in my life.**



My wife cheated on me nearly ten years ago. I won't get into the specifics, as they're unimportant, but due to the fact that I saw blame on both of our parts, I forgave her and we moved past it.

My daughter is sixteen years old, and she only just found out, from my MIL, who seems to have decided she was old enough to hear the family 'gossip', and that she would be 'mature' enough not to confront her. Initially, my wife thought I had told her, and came into my office where I had been, to ask me what the hell I was thinking, and if I was trying to destroy their relationship. (She and my daughter have been strained for a couple years now, lots of arguing, on both sides.) She refused to believe that I hadn't said anything at first until my daughter entered the room and joined in on the screaming that I was too 'weak' and her own mother had sold her out.

The fighting went on a long time, and honestly I may as well have not been there, for all the good I did. I tried to step between them when I was concerned, but that only ended with some ringing in my ear, haha. Eventually, my wife left to cool off, and my daughter and I could talk. She wasn't happy with me either, and didn't hesitate to tell me so, but she wasn't screaming or throwing shit anymore, so I just let her get it out.

She asked me why I stayed and I was honest, that I was no perfect husband, and I decided not to end my marriage, break up our home, and destroy her childhood for something that I held blame in as well.

The entire time I was speaking, she just kept watching me with this sad face that made me uncomfortable, but when I finished she just shook her head and said that I needed to leave my wife, and that the cheating 'wasn't the only issue'. She started bringing up every insignificant 'flaw' my wife has, (She brought up my wife getting angry at me because I had put too much creamer in her coffee, for example, just trivial crap).

I told her as much but she just kept shaking her head. It ended up turning into an argument where she insisted I was some sort of victim, and making some kind of getaway plan. I kept trying to talk her down, but that was going no where.

I first tried my wife, but found my call went straight to voicemail, so I called my MIL to inform her of the situation, but my wife had already made it there, and planned to stay overnight to calm down, because she didn't want to 'see either of our faces'.

It's been a few days now and I still haven't seen her, or heard from her, but her mother informs me she's okay, just very emotional. So I'm also scared for my wife (She has had mental health struggles before, and if she's going through that again, I should be there to help). (EDIT: To the people who have commented, or private messaged me to say I shouldn't care. My wife almost died the last time she had an episode, and I don't think even my daughter, as angry as she Is right now, wants her mom dead). My daughter told me she hopes her mother never came back. I'm just feeling defeated, and tired. I've done everything I can to keep this family floating, and somehow I'm still failing. It's beginning to feel like I always do, at everything, and always will fail at everything, as long as I live.

*Ok few thoughts here:*

*1- MIL is completely in the wrong, it‚Äôs NO ONES business to fill daughter in on ‚Äòfamily gossip‚Äô that includes her parents.*

*2- I‚Äôm sure some of this is normal teenage rebellion crap.*

*HOWEVER:*

*Your wife got angry about too much creamer in the coffee? You say trivial stuff BUT*

*How often does wife get overly sensitive about trivial shit? There is a point where it becomes you managing wife‚Äôs emotional outbursts instead of wife working on her own issues.*

*Does daughter have a point at all?*



**SignificantOrange139**

*Yeah because that's an odd thing to get genuinely angry over. And it makes me wonder why mom and daughter were butting heads to start. Maybe moms not just abusive to dad...*



**Most-Ad1713**

*Gotta say it OP and you probably won't listen (based on your comments that I've read) - your wife has issues and you're covering it up with 'but she's a good person' and not answering when people say her behavior is abusive.*

*Let me tell you a story - I'm a good man and husband who has plenty of faults but about 10 years ago, I got into an argument with my wife and neither of us was listening to the other, we were just feeding each other's anger. That went on until I spun around and smashed my fist into a wall - that act of violent release made both of us stop and I will never forget the look of terror on her face when I turned around to apologize. I didn't have any intention of hitting her, I didn't threaten her, I just needed to let off the built-up anger I was feeling in a way I had learned worked for me. Turns out that scaring my wife woke me up to the emotional issues I was having and now I'm heavily medicated for bi-polar disorder and can have rational discussions and even arguments with her and never feel the need to violently release my emotions.*

*If your wife blew up at you about the amount of creamer in her coffee she's going to keep verbally and emotionally abusing you (and maybe your daughter too) until she gets to a point where throwing things or hitting something (or someone) becomes the 'best' way for her to calm down. See how escalation of release works? First, it's discuss things to resolve issues, but when that stopped working, it became yelling and screaming. The next thing will likely be throwing and/or breaking things but when that stops working... I'll let you fill in the rest because honestly if your daughter calling you a doormat didn't shake you loose I don't know that I can say anything to help.*



**Update - 1 year later**



It's been a while. I probably will regret posting this as much as I did the first time, though for different reasons. Before I begin, I want to thank all the kind people who reached out with genuine advice and with whom I had lovely conversations. I appreciate you more than I can say.

Checking my history, I saw that I never updated after the conversation with my daughter about her situation with my wife. We talked, and it went worse than I expected, but better than most of the comments. She never hit my daughter or threatened her. My daughter did bring up the yelling, and I listened, though she said she was never afraid of her mother, but she started to hate her when she noticed how she treated me; hence the change in appearance and rebelling. She liked that I stood up for her when it came to her new style, because then I was 'standing up for something'. That makes me laugh a bit now, but at the time, I was confused.

We talked a long time, and she said she thought maybe she could get over the resentment she had for her mother if she didn't have to see the way she treats me. I didn't much like that at the time, and I admit I argued that I was an adult and she didn't have to fight my fights for me. My daughter said something like, 'If I don't, who will?' and it just kinda stopped me in my tracks, because my only answer, 'Sometimes you have to pick your battles,' sounds weak when you pick none of them.

I still intended to try to work on my marriage, despite the comments. I really hoped to turn things around because of their previous relationship, and frankly, how much I still loved my then-wife. But then she didn't come home for weeks. I don't know if it was my daughters needling, or the fact I could tell she was upset at being abandoned by her mother at the first sign of trouble, but one day I eventually reached out and asked my Ex-Mil when my wife was going to come home and act like an adult, and was told she was looking into divorce attorneys, and that if I wanted her back I should really work on getting my daughter to apologize.

It all felt so manipulative, and I just got so angry. I just hung up and spoke to my own Lawyer. After being served, she tried to come back and cried that it was her mental health, but I was still so angry, I just shut her down and told her to leave. Divorce was finalized a while ago., My Daughter stays with me most of the time, since her mother moved out of state afterward, and she wants to go to college in the area when the time comes, but visits MIL, and speaks to her mother on the phone sometimes. As much as I hate to admit it, their relationship is improving since the divorce.

I don't hate my Ex-wife, even if many, including my daughter, categorize her as abusive; she's the first woman I ever really clicked with in that way, and though I don't love her anymore, probably the last. I don't mind it so much, I have a full life without her around, and a quieter one as well.

But, anyway, thank you all again for listening, and I am bracing for ""I told you so's"". I don't blame you, you did.



**Comments**



**Ok\_Introduction9466**

*Glad she‚Äôs your ex. Your wife was abusive. It takes a while to come to terms with but your daughter was right and I hope you‚Äôre happier now. Leaving abuse is really important for the kids involved.*



**JTBlakeinNYC**

*She thought your daughter should apologize??! You will be so much better off without her.*

>OOP: I'm fairly certain she wanted my teenage daughter to pretend she didn't even know. Which is ridiculous, and regardless of my feelings on the incident, that wasn't going to happen. and I wouldn't want it to.



**CarryOk3080**

*Your daughter saved all 3 of your lives. Your wife was abusive. Your daughter was being abused, and so were you. I'm glad she was adult enough to finally put an end to this madness. I really hope your ex-wife gets serious mental help and your daughter doesn't have lasting effects from it.*

>OOP: From what I know my ex is ""Finding herself"". Good for her, I never even knew she was lost.

>My daughter is a strong young woman. Stronger than I ever was or ever will be. I am more proud of her than I can possibly explain, even without this situation. She's the best part of my life, and to quote the old sayings, when I count my blessings I count her twice.

Hey there, fellow budget-conscious warriors of MaximizeMe! üëã You won't believe how much hidden treasure there is in clearance aisles, and I'm here to spill some serious tea about turning pennies into profit. Whether you're looking to save, resell, or just get the thrill of a killer deal, this guide is your map to success! üó∫Ô∏èüí∞

## Why Hidden Clearance is the Best Kept Secret

Have you ever walked past a clearance section thinking it's just leftovers? ü§î Think again! Retailers often hide massive markdowns, especially to make room for new stock. With the right strategies, you can find super-low prices on items that are perfect for personal use or resale. Just think of the potential... Selling these finds could basically fund your coffee habit for a year! ‚òï‚ú® 

## Tools of the Trade: The Essentials

Before we dive deep, make sure you‚Äôre equipped with:
- **Patience:** Clearance hunting is like a treasure hunt; good things come to those who wait.
- **Smartphone:** Your key to scanners, apps, and checking real-time discounts.
- **Cashback Apps:** Download apps like Ibotta or Rakuten to double down on savings.
- **Knowledge:** Stay updated with our community tips and tricks. It's all free right here: [emoney clearance secrets](https://whop.com/emoney/?a=liveitupdeals).

## Pro Tips for Finding Hidden Deals

1. **Timing is Everything:** Visit stores after holidays, end-of-season, or whenever a brand new shipment arrives. That's when retailers mark down old inventory drastically. üõí

2. **Know the Markdown Codes:** Different stores have unique codes or colors on price tags indicating clearance. Learn these codes for your favorite stores to identify deep discounts instantly.

3. **Use Price Scanners:** Some hidden deals aren't marked visibly. Use in-store price scanners or apps to discover unadvertised discounts. üì≤

4. **Loyalty Programs:** Enroll in loyalty programs for early alerts. Sometimes clearance starts online for members before hitting the shelves.

5. **Watch the Ends of Aisles:** Prime clearance spots at many stores are at the end caps or corners of aisles, where they showcase markdowns.

## Best Stores for Clearance Deals

- **Target:** Look for yellow stickers and bring a good eye‚Äîand the Target app‚Äîto scan prices not yet updated on the tags.
- **Walmart:** Known for rolling back prices without much fanfare, so get into the habit of scanning items yourself.
- **TJ Maxx/Marshalls:** Discount levels increase every few weeks‚Äîbe there on markdown days to nab the best picks.
- **Home Depot/Lowe‚Äôs:** Check outside of peak season, especially in gardening or seasonal decor sections.

## Reselling Your Finds

Why stop at personal savings when you can earn some extra cash? List your hidden clearance treasures on marketplaces like eBay, Mercari, or Facebook Marketplace. Remember to:
- **Calculate Your Costs:** Don‚Äôt forget to include shipping fees and platform transaction costs when pricing your items.
- **Be Descriptive:** Provide clear descriptions and multiple photos of your products to attract buyers.

1kiam6w,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/1kiam6w/is_this_normal/,Is this normal?,"My Father is an angry man and his not afraid to show it. 

The smallest thing ticks him off and somehow makes it a big problem. He likes to make small talks to waiters/cashiers or people who basically serves him, but during this conversations he just become rude or he ends up making this people uncomfortable.  I had to avoid him when his talking to people because i only end up feeling bad in how he treats this people. 
His even worst when unknown numbers call him. I know how annoying it is when people call your number and try to scam you, but unstead of hanging up, my father would yell and curse. Loudly, at the phone. It doesn't matter who hears him. Also, there are also this times when his driving and someone makes a mistake on the road by being too slow, he would drive beside them and roll down his window and scream his head off at them. He did this to an old man with a child, A man and a woman. He did it 3 times while i was in the car. For me, i think that he enjoys fighting people who are not able to fight back. 

If you think this only happens to random strangers, but it doesn't. It happens to me, a LOT. 

He screams at me for wiping the table wrong, he says that it should be in a circular motion. I remember him calling me ""stupid"" and ""you never know how to do things right""  multiple times when i was younger, i think i was 9-10 years old.
I remember him making me making me do the set the table, clean the table and wash the dishes while he lets my brother off everytime. Then he started to say that i should start cooking, because i'm a woman and i should be doing this things. My father yells at me whenever i accidentally leave the cup i used in the sink but whenever he leaves his own, he would tell me or my mother to wash it. 
He would tell my mother how she should cook meals. (i have never seen him touch the stove my entire life.), He gets upset whenever i'm late to an event that is important to him while he, knowing im late for school would stop by a drive-thru to order coffee, making me even more late than i already was (He doesn't allow me to commute.)
I asked him one time that i needed something for school because my teacher said its required. He refused to let me have it and said its bullshit and i don't need it and he threatened to call my teacher to insult her. (We aren't having financial problems btw). Sometimes when his REALLY angry, he would yell LOUD until your ears would ring and your head will ache, it doesn't matter if his co workers are listening, he would grab something and slam it on a surface just to make you stop doing something or talking. 
I also remember when i was a kid (maybe 6 or 7) he and my mother fought and i heard him spitting. I'm not sure if he spat on her food, his food or at her. 

He was also physically absent when i was born until i was 5 maybe (He was working abroad). he comes home and my mother found out he was cheating on her. I remember him throwing clothes all over the floor, him just packing his things and k was clinging to his leg begging him to not leave while he screams that it is all my mother's fault and my crying was pointless. (He stayed and my parents are still currently somehow happily married) I don't think he knows that i remember. 

My father doesn hurt me and my brother physically. I don't think his physically abusive, but i do remember when i was a little girl, i may have annoyed him to the point he slapped me on the face, not that hard that it had bruised but he did. There was also this time when my parents and brother are fighting. My brother was trying to push him out of his room, his not even pushing him hard ir shoving him, just trying to guide him out until suddenly my father started to wrestle him and headlock him in front of me. when he stoped he just told me to and his words: ""Shut the fhck up for once"" i was 12 and my brother was 15. 

He never apologized. not directly. When he slapped me, i was half asleep and i remember him gently carresing my head. But i'm still not sure if i dreamt about it or if it was real. Now that i'm older, his wy of apologising is buying me things. The only thing i ever really wanted was him to apologize, even once.


I wrote this because i wanted your help to help me understand my father. i don't want to burden my friends with something like this so i thought it would be a good idea to ask a bunch of strangers who doesn't know me.

This happened when I was a teen but to this day I think this needs to be addressed 'cos there are SO MANY CHEE KO PEKS nowadays. 

So I was 14, I was that teen that was very introverted, all I did was play games at home/ lan shop and read my comics. I kept to myself a lot at school but in my neighbourhood I was always that lil' shit that will say hi to everyone and everything is all sunshines and shit. My cousin and I lived a block away from each other and we would always visit each other daily. 

One night we found out there was a Satay uncle selling satay at our coffeeshop, I went down with my cousin to get some and was just being chatty and friendly (the pg13 kind ah btw), everything was all fine until he started staying longer at the coffee shop, he started showing me pictures of himself and ask if this or that photo looks good. I just went with it 'cos I thought it was harmless. 

So next to the coffeeshop there was a jamming studio, a barbershop and a lan shop that I always go to, pop by say hi and hang after school. A nasi padang shop just opened and because I was buying a lot of food there, next thing I know man started working there which I was a bit eh about but hey everyone needs a job right? So I ignored it. When there was a period of time I was hanging at the jamming studio a lot, one day I was passing by when I saw that he was there.

He started working at the jamming studio la.

  
I started feeling a bit confused bout what was going on. I went to my tution classes above the coffeeshop, was studying and before I left my tutor was like ""Stay away from the guy with the red hair. He's not a good guy."" ""Huh. Why?"" My tutor told me that he was wearing a ring that's associated to bomoh black magic and hey I just dont fuck with the paranormal 'cos you know, respect the dead \*peace sign\*

I felt a lil' uneasy after what my tutor said so I took his advice. I stopped saying hi to him, I avoided eye contact and just get on with my life. This was when things started getting creepy...

  
Can you imagine you as a bloody 14 year old walking home from school and you hear someone doing those long draggy whispers like Voldemort speaking sweet nothings to Harry. Imagine la ""Haaaaaaaaaaaaarry...... Haaaaaaaaarryyyyy"" while you walking home and he's just across the block looking at you like with that Evil Patrick Star Smiling Meme with a cheetos red wig on. The tone he said it was like he's trying to be Dracula seducing some headless chicken to be sacrificed. NO.

  
Worst part is that he did it so many times, he even did it in broad daylight while my classmates were with me to go to my house la. My classmates also had the ick. So that happened for quite a while, you know with all of this happening so much it starts to get annoying rather than creepy. He sparked a fire in me that that's when I learnt the art of swearing. I have never sweared so much in my life but it was getting too uncomfortable. I went to the Lan shop, just playing Maplestory, Audition and whatnot, that Chee ko pek came in and started hanging around behind me and trying to talk, it was like as if he was trying to make his presence known. I shocked everyone when I raised my voice and swore at him. Okay la red flag for swearing at your elders but give hall pass okay?

So! this shit happened for what, like two years? This nightmare. I can't walk in to the coffeeshop without feeling like someone's undressing me with their eyes, when I go home at night, I take the long route home. It was just damn sien to feel so unsafe at a place that you always thought everything is fine. I even told my family but they thought I was asking for attention. HELLO YOU THINK THIS IS ATTENTION??!? \*facepalm\*

I thought I had to live with this 'til the day my boobs drop to the floor but one fine day, shit escalated. HARD. I had an asthma attack, was really bad and I was knocked out in bed, I woke up to my cousin shaking me and going ""Kakak! Kakak! Guess what!!"" ""Ah?"" ""UNCLE JERRY CHASED THE SATAY MAN OUT WITH A KNIFE LA!"" I jumped out of bed and thats when my cousin told me everything.

  
My cousin was cycling home when the CKP called him over, he asked if any of the women in my family are married, asked my cousin to have sex with me, take photos of me naked, told my cousin how he wants to have sex with me and all. My cousin came to my house and told my uncle (he was living with us and mind you he's a very introverted, I want to live in peace type) and my uncle went down with a knife to confront him. 

The CKP disappeared for good half an hour later and never came back since. Everyone in the neighbourhood was talking about it, I was at the barbershop and the barber was talking bout the mysterious man who chased CKP off, he got a shock when he found out it was my uncle, the barber then told me that any girl who is nice to CKP will make him think that they are in love with him. Man was delusional la. Also everyone in the coffeeshop was drinking and celebrating 'cos apparently noone liked the guy so.

  
Things have been peaceful ever since but guess what. I went to Lau Pa Sat at night with my friends when suddenly... ""Haaaaaaarrrryyyyyyyyy....... Harrryyyyyyyy"" Kanina the man is now a satay uncle there. 'Til now I only go there with my guy friends once in a blue man. 

IF YOU SEE A RED CHEETO HAIRED PANTAT, THAT IS HIM. HIDE YO GIRLS. 

Better yet, teach your ladies to protect themselves. 

This is why I stopped being smiling, being friendly and saying hi to people. Sad sia.

Okay, let‚Äôs get real for a second. Have you ever felt like retirement planning is like trying to solve a Rubik's Cube blindfolded? ü§î You think you have it figured out, and then WHAM! New risks, new opportunities, and suddenly you're like, ‚ÄúWait, where‚Äôs my reset button?‚Äù

Well, fear not, my friends! I recently immersed myself into what *financial advisors* are saying about retirement in 2025, and let me tell you‚Äîthere's some enlightening stuff coming from the Bogleheads community. So grab a coffee (or your beverage of choice) and let‚Äôs dive in!

**Here‚Äôs the lowdown on what you should be aware of in the upcoming years:**

1. **Volatility Is Here to Stay** üìâüìà  
   The market‚Äôs been up, down, and all around like the wildest amusement park ride. Financial pros are urging us to manage our emotions and expectations. Remember, if it were easy, everyone would be millionaires!

2. **Inflation Will Have Its Say** üå≠üõí  
   Yep, those gas prices aren‚Äôt just a passing phase. As prices rise, we must account for how it affects our buying power in retirement. It‚Äôs one more reason to think ahead‚Äîno one wants to be wondering ‚ÄúWhere'd my money go?‚Äù at the grocery store.

3. **Boosting Your Savings is Key** üí™üí∏

1kiaf91,https://www.reddit.com/r/DoctorsAdvice/comments/1kiaf91/i_get_so_drowsy_i_feel_drugged_everyday_at_the/,I get so drowsy I feel drugged everyday at the same time.,"Hello! 

I'm already scheduled for an MRI so I am honestly just looking for some feedback as to what might be wrong with me. Also sorry this is so long.

I am just someone that reads ahead in books, looks up the ending of movies as I'm watching them, and Googles everything that's wrong with me (because I need to know) some would say that's a hypochondriac. I know I am one, but not because I want to be sick, but because I know there's something wrong I just need to know. 

My symptoms get worse when it's warmer. So they kinda go dormant in the winter, 
Last summer my arm started to go numb, not really numb more like the feeling when you roll your sleeve up too high and it gently squeezes circulation. I could still feel the sensation of touch so this was really hard to explain to my doctor. 

I also had really bad brain fog, I had it while driving where I would be driving somewhere and suddenly feel like I'm driving in a completely different direction and in a completely different place. (Like I'd forget where I was even if I concentrated on paying attention) 
I kept losing things and forgetting things. 

I also had to focus to keep my eyes from blurring over ( I can make them unfocus on demand and it almost felt like I had to actively focus like when one manually breathes) 

I also have a vitamin D deficiency which I've been taking super strong vitamin D to help with. I don't know if that is working. 

And tiredness. Things that were easy were becoming more difficult like walking up the stairs was winding me a little. I am a cleaner and normal routines of dusting and wiping were becoming more difficult, I was physically getting slower and it would show in my clean times.

This all kinda went away in the winter.

Now, my memory is getting worse again, I keep forgetting things and losing things. Forgetting things I SWORE I put away in my car. Nope left it on the porch. 

My arm gets numb (sometimes not as often as before but I only really noticed it last year in like July or August so it could potentially just be gradually getting worse with the heat) 

I'm slow again which is so annoying, I'm also tired and fatigued i cannot get up before 9 anymore for work ( this has been accommodated and I have a later start time, which I am so grateful for) 

Now a new thing has been happening (more frequently that I have noticed it becoming a pattern, it's not completely new but it's not been this frequent) i get SO drowsy at like 7-8pm so much so that I can't keep my eyes open. I fall asleep sitting up even, it feels akin to taking two benadryl. I literally feel tipsy or drugged everyday at around the same time. Then after a couple hours of a nap I wake up AWAKE. I tried having coffee this morning to counter it. Didn't do anything. I also can't just go to sleep super early because I just wake up alert and awake. This one is really starting to affect me because some of my shifts are later in the evening and I have a REALLY tough time working through this period. 

Anyway, I don't really know what I am looking for, any kind of recognition or advice of what you might think this could be is quite helpful. ",1,1746766509.0,DoctorsAdvice,1,1.0,False
1kiaeh8,https://youtu.be/_aqPib203-0,3 Very Scary TRUE Fishing Gone Wrong Horror Stories,"**""Jaws in the Shallows"":**

I woke up that Sunday morning in Lake County, Florida, feeling the itch to fish. Lake Monroe was my spot, a place where I‚Äôd spent countless weekends chasing bass, losing myself in the quiet of the water and the thrill of a tug on my line. The sun was already climbing, promising a warm day, and I couldn‚Äôt wait to get out there.Before I left, I grabbed my phone and called my buddy Mike. ‚ÄúHey, man, I‚Äôm heading to Lake Monroe to fish. You coming or what?‚ÄùMike groaned through the line. ‚ÄúUgh, I‚Äôd kill to go, but I‚Äôm stuck mowing the lawn and fixing the fence. Wife‚Äôs orders. You gonna hook a big one?‚Äù‚ÄúBiggest bass you‚Äôve ever seen,‚Äù I said, grinning. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll send you a pic to make you jealous.‚ÄùHe laughed. ‚ÄúYou better. Don‚Äôt get eaten by an alligator out there.‚Äù‚ÄúHa, yeah, right,‚Äù I said, brushing it off. ‚ÄúCatch you later.‚Äù I hung up, grabbed my gear, and started packing the truck. My fishing rod was an old favorite, scratched but reliable, paired with a reel I‚Äôd tuned just right. I tossed in my tackle box, stuffed with lures, hooks, and worms, and a small cooler with two cans of soda, a turkey sandwich, and a bag of chips. The drive was short, maybe 20 minutes, and I cranked up some old country tunes, singing off-key with the windows down, the warm air whipping through the cab.When I pulled up to Lake Monroe, I parked near the shore and took a second to breathe it in. The lake was gorgeous that day, its surface smooth as glass, reflecting the blue sky and a few puffy clouds. Ducks paddled lazily near the reeds, and dragonflies zipped over the water. Tall cypress trees lined the edges, their gnarled roots dipping into the shallows, creating perfect hiding spots for fish. The air smelled like mud and wet leaves, with a hint of something sweet, maybe wildflowers. It was the kind of place that made you forget the world for a while.I hauled my gear to a shallow spot I liked, where the water was clear enough to see minnows darting. I unfolded my beat-up camping chair, its canvas frayed from years of use, and set it on the soft ground. After baiting my hook with a wriggling worm, I cast my line out, the bobber landing with a satisfying plop. I cracked open a soda, the hiss loud in the quiet, and settled in to wait.The first hour was slow. I reeled in a couple of sunfish, their bright scales catching the light, but they were too small to keep. I let them go, watching them wiggle back into the depths. The sun climbed higher, warming my face, and I started to sweat. I figured I‚Äôd try a new spot, closer to a patch of lily pads about 30 yards away. Bass love those pads, hiding in the shade to ambush prey.As I packed up to move, I noticed a weathered sign stapled to a cypress tree: ‚ÄúCaution: Alligators Present. Do Not Feed or Approach.‚Äù The letters were faded, and I‚Äôd seen it a dozen times before. Alligators were just part of Florida life‚Äîlurking in canals, ponds, even golf courses. I‚Äôd spotted them in the lake before, usually just a pair of eyes in the distance, and they always swam off. I wasn‚Äôt worried.At the new spot, I set up again, this time standing to get a better cast. The lily pads floated in clusters, their green discs bobbing gently. I tied on a shiny lure, hoping to tempt a big bass, and sent it sailing into a gap between the pads. The water rippled, and I felt a spark of excitement. This was gonna be the spot.I got a bite pretty quick‚Äîa solid tug that made my rod bend. ‚ÄúHere we go,‚Äù I muttered, reeling in a two-pound bass, its sides flashing silver-green. I held it up, admiring the fight in it, then worked the hook out and let it splash back into the lake. ‚ÄúSwim free, buddy.‚ÄùBut then I heard something‚Äîa rustle in the bushes behind me, like something heavy moving through the grass. I spun around, scanning the trees and underbrush. Nothing. Just the wind, maybe, or a raccoon. My pulse ticked up, but I shook it off and turned back to my line.A loud splash broke the quiet. I jerked my head toward the sound, and my stomach dropped. About 20 feet out, just beyond the lily pads, two eyes and a snout poked above the water. An alligator. It was big, its head wide and dark, the rest of its body hidden beneath the surface. Those eyes were locked on me, unblinking, like black marbles.I froze, my rod still in my hands. I‚Äôd seen alligators before, but this one wasn‚Äôt acting right. It didn‚Äôt dive or swim away. Instead, it started gliding toward me, slow and steady, cutting through the water like a torpedo. Ripples fanned out, and I saw more of it now‚Äîmaybe eight or nine feet long, its scaly back glistening.‚ÄúOkay, time to go,‚Äù I said under my breath, my voice shaky. I reeled in my line fast, the bobber bouncing across the water. I grabbed my chair, folded it clumsily, and slung my tackle box over my shoulder. The cooler could wait. I started walking back to my truck, sticking to the gravel path that wound along the shore. Every few steps, I glanced at the water. The alligator was still there, keeping pace with me, its head barely above the surface, tail swishing side to side.My heart was hammering now. The truck was maybe 50 yards away, but it felt like miles. I picked up my pace, my boots crunching louder, the tackle box banging against my hip. The alligator sped up too, closing the gap. It was maybe 10 feet from the shore now, and I could hear the water sloshing around it.I tried to stay calm. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt run,‚Äù I told myself. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt turn your back.‚Äù But panic was creeping in, making my legs feel wobbly. I looked back again, and that‚Äôs when it happened. The alligator surged out of the water, its body exploding onto the bank with a speed I didn‚Äôt think possible. Its jaws snapped, teeth flashing, missing my leg by inches. I stumbled back, my chair slipping from my grip, and the tackle box fell, spilling lures and hooks into the dirt.It slid back into the water but didn‚Äôt leave. It hovered there, eyes fixed on me, like it was waiting for me to make another mistake. My chest heaved, sweat stinging my eyes. I backed away slowly, hands out, like I could ward it off. The path was narrow here, lined with roots and rocks, and I was terrified of tripping.Then I did. My heel caught on a cypress root, and I went down hard, landing on my back. The air rushed out of me, and before I could scramble up, the alligator lunged again. This time, its jaws clamped onto my right leg, just below the knee. Pain seared through me, white-hot, like my leg was caught in a vice. I screamed, a raw, desperate sound, and kicked with my other leg, but it was like kicking a wall.It started dragging me toward the water, its strength unreal. The ground scraped my back, and I clawed at the dirt, trying to grab anything‚Äîroots, rocks, anything to hold on. ‚ÄúHelp! Somebody, please!‚Äù I shouted, but the lake was deserted. No boats, no other fishermen, just me and this thing trying to drown me.My hands found a stick, thick and jagged, maybe two feet long. I swung it at the alligator‚Äôs head, but its hide was like armor. The stick cracked, and it didn‚Äôt even flinch. The water was closer now, lapping at my boots. I was hyperventilating, my vision blurring, but something clicked in my brain. I‚Äôd read somewhere that alligators hate getting hit in the eyes. It was my only shot.With every ounce of strength I had left, I gripped the stick and stabbed it into the alligator‚Äôs left eye, driving it deep. It let out a hissing roar, a sound that chilled my blood, and its jaws loosened. I yanked my leg free, the pain so bad I nearly blacked out. I crawled backward, dragging myself through the mud, expecting it to come after me again. But it thrashed in the water, shaking its head, then sank below the surface.I didn‚Äôt wait to see if it was gone. I staggered to my feet, my right leg barely working, blood pouring down my shin. My jeans were shredded, and I could see torn skin and muscle. I limped to my truck, every step agony, glancing back every second. The alligator was still there, a dark shape under the water, watching.I fumbled with my keys, my hands slick with sweat and blood. When I finally got the door open, I threw myself inside and slammed it shut, locking it. My whole body was shaking, and I could barely think. I grabbed my phone and dialed 911, my fingers slipping on the screen.‚Äú911, what‚Äôs your emergency?‚Äù a woman‚Äôs voice said, calm and steady.‚ÄúI got attacked by an alligator!‚Äù I gasped, my voice breaking. ‚ÄúLake Monroe, by the shore. It bit my leg, and I‚Äôm bleeding bad. I‚Äôm in my truck.‚Äù‚ÄúAlright, sir, stay where you are. Paramedics are on the way. Can you put pressure on the wound?‚Äù‚ÄúI‚ÄîI think so,‚Äù I said. I ripped off my flannel shirt, wincing as I moved, and wrapped it around my leg. The fabric soaked through fast, but I tied it as tight as I could, gritting my teeth against the pain. ‚ÄúHurry, please. It‚Äôs still out there.‚Äù‚ÄúHelp‚Äôs coming, just stay calm and keep pressure on it,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre doing great.‚ÄùI leaned back, trying to breathe, my eyes glued to the water. The alligator hadn‚Äôt moved, its eyes just above the surface, like it was daring me to come back. Every ripple made my heart jump.It felt like forever, but probably only 10 minutes passed before I heard sirens. An ambulance and a sheriff‚Äôs truck pulled up, lights flashing. A paramedic, a stocky guy with a buzz cut, banged on my window. ‚ÄúSir, it‚Äôs the paramedics! Open the door!‚ÄùI unlocked it, and he helped me out, easing me onto a stretcher. ‚ÄúHoly hell, you‚Äôre lucky,‚Äù he said, cutting away what was left of my jeans. ‚ÄúThat thing did a number on you.‚Äù His partner, a woman with quick hands, wrapped my leg in clean bandages, the pressure making me hiss.They loaded me into the ambulance, and the sheriff stayed behind to check the area. As we drove away, I caught one last glimpse of the lake, the water still and peaceful again, like nothing had happened.At the hospital, the ER was a blur of white coats and beeping machines. A doctor, an older guy with gray hair, examined my leg. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre fortunate,‚Äù he said, his voice calm. ‚ÄúThe bite missed your major arteries. We‚Äôll need to clean it, stitch it, and you‚Äôll need antibiotics to prevent infection. Surgery‚Äôs likely, and you‚Äôll have scarring, maybe some mobility issues for a while. But you‚Äôll walk again.‚ÄùI nodded, still dazed. ‚ÄúIt just‚Ä¶ came out of nowhere.‚Äù‚ÄúThey do that sometimes,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAlligators are unpredictable, especially if they feel threatened or hungry.‚ÄùRecovery was slow. I spent a week in the hospital, then months of physical therapy to get my leg working right. The scars are ugly, jagged lines crisscrossing my shin, and I limp when I‚Äôm tired. I found out later that alligator attacks aren‚Äôt uncommon in Florida‚Äîhundreds happen over the years, some fatal. That one was probably defending its territory or mistook me for prey.I still fish, but not at Lake Monroe. I stick to smaller lakes, ones with clear signs of no alligators. I‚Äôm hypervigilant now, jumping at every splash, every shadow in the water. Sometimes, at night, I dream of those eyes, staring at me from the dark, and I wake up gasping, my leg throbbing like it‚Äôs still in those jaws. That day taught me how fast nature can turn on you, how one wrong step can bring you face-to-face with something that doesn‚Äôt care if you live or die.





**""Teeth in the Deep"":**

I stood on Aldinga Beach, the morning of December 8, 1963, my bare feet sinking into the warm sand. The sun was high, glinting off the waves, and the salty air stung my nose. I was Rodney Fox, 23, gearing up for the South Australian Spearfishing Championship. My wetsuit clung to my skin, and my spear gun felt heavy in my hands. I‚Äôd won this competition last year, and I wasn‚Äôt about to let the trophy slip away. But my stomach twisted, not just from the pressure to win. Kay, my wife of four months, had been quiet all morning, her worry hanging between us like a [fog.At](http://fog.At) breakfast, she‚Äôd pushed her toast around her plate, her brown eyes fixed on me. ‚ÄúRodney, please be careful out there,‚Äù she said, her voice soft but tight. ‚ÄúThe ocean‚Äôs so big, and‚Ä¶ things happen.‚ÄùI reached across the table, squeezing her hand. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be fine, love. I know these waters. Gotta bring home that trophy, right?‚ÄùShe didn‚Äôt smile, just held my hand tighter. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care about the trophy. Just come home.‚ÄùHer words stuck with me as I checked my gear on the beach. The other divers were milling around, laughing, adjusting masks, and bragging about their plans. There were maybe 50 of us, all chasing the biggest fish to score points. I nodded at a few familiar faces, but my mind was already out there, in the deep water. To win, I needed something special‚Äîa dusky morwong, big and heavy, the kind that lurked farther out where the ocean turned dark and cold. Most divers stayed closer to shore, but I‚Äôd always gone deeper. That‚Äôs what made me champion.I waded into the surf, the water cool against my legs. My fins slapped the surface as I swam out, past the buoys, past the other divers bobbing like corks. The ocean was clear, sunlight slicing through to the sandy bottom. I could see schools of fish darting below, their scales flashing. About 800 yards from shore, I spotted a rocky outcrop‚Äîa perfect hiding spot for morwong. My heart pounded, not just from the swim but from the thrill. This was it.I took a deep breath, filling my lungs, and dove. The world went silent, just the muffled thump of my pulse in my ears. The water pressed against me, cold and heavy. At 30 feet down, the rocks loomed, crusted with seaweed and small crabs. I glided closer, my spear gun steady. Then I saw it‚Äîa dusky morwong, fat and slow, its fins twitching as it hovered near a crevice. My finger tightened on the trigger, my breath burning in my chest.WHAM! Something slammed into me, a tremendous force that knocked the air from my lungs. My mask ripped off, my spear gun tore from my hands, and I was spinning, tumbling through the water. Pain exploded in my chest, sharp and searing. I couldn‚Äôt see, couldn‚Äôt think. My mouth filled with salt water, bitter and choking. My arms flailed, reaching for something, anything, but there was only pain and darkness.Then I felt it‚Äîrough, like sandpaper, grinding against my skin. Teeth. Huge, jagged teeth clamped around my chest, crushing me. My mind screamed one word: Shark! A great white, it had to be. I‚Äôd seen them before, cruising the deep waters, but never like this. This was a monster, maybe 12 or 14 feet, its jaws locked on me like a vice. I could feel its power, the raw strength as it shook me, my ribs cracking under the pressure. Blood clouded the water, warm and sticky, swirling around us. My blood.Panic clawed at me. I was going to die. The shark‚Äôs black eyes stared, cold and empty, like nothing human. My lungs burned, my vision spotting. I thrashed, kicking with my fins, but it was like fighting a wall. My hands scrabbled over its head, feeling the slick, leathery skin. Then I remembered something‚Äîa story from an old diver about shark attacks. Go for the eyes. It was my only chance.I wrapped my arms around its massive head, pulling myself close in a desperate bear hug. My fingers clawed at its face, sliding over slime until I found an eye, soft and yielding. I dug in, hard, my nails sinking into the flesh. The shark jerked, its jaws loosening for a split second. I kicked with all I had, my fin smacking its snout. The teeth scraped free, tearing my wetsuit and skin, but I was loose.I shot toward the surface, my chest screaming for air. I broke through, gasping, coughing up water. ‚ÄúHelp!‚Äù I croaked, my voice weak. Blood poured from my chest, staining the waves red. I looked down and saw it‚Äîthe shark, circling below, a dark shadow in the crimson water. My float line, tied to my belt, was caught in its teeth, the buoy bouncing on the surface. I fumbled for my knife, hands shaking, but before I could cut the line, the shark dove.The line snapped tight, yanking me under. I screamed, bubbles exploding from my mouth. The shark towed me, fast and deep, the pressure crushing my ears. My chest felt like it was caving in, my broken ribs grinding. I pulled against the line, but it was useless. The ocean blurred, my vision fading. I thought of Kay, her face, her voice saying, Just come home. I couldn‚Äôt let her down.With a sharp twang, the line broke. The sudden release sent me rocketing upward. I hit the surface, choking, my arms flailing. ‚ÄúHelp! Shark!‚Äù I shouted, but my voice was barely a rasp. Blood streamed from my wounds, and I could feel my strength slipping away. My legs were heavy, my head spinning. I was going to pass out, sink, and that shark was still down there.Then I heard it‚Äîa low hum, getting louder. A boat. I turned, squinting through the salt in my eyes, and saw it‚Äîa small rescue boat from the competition, speeding toward me. Two men were aboard, their faces pale as they leaned over the side.‚ÄúRodney! Hold on, mate!‚Äù one shouted. I recognized him‚ÄîTom, a diver I‚Äôd shared a beer with last year. His mate, Jim, was at the wheel, his knuckles white.They reached me, strong hands grabbing my arms. ‚ÄúGot you!‚Äù Tom grunted, hauling me over the side. I collapsed on the deck, shivering, pain stabbing with every breath. My wetsuit was in tatters, blood pooling beneath me. I could feel my ribs, jagged and wrong, and something warm leaking inside my chest‚Äì‚ÄúBloody hell, Rodney, what happened?‚Äù Jim asked, his eyes wide as he glanced at my wounds.‚ÄúShark,‚Äù I gasped, clutching my chest. ‚ÄúGreat white‚Ä¶ bit me.‚ÄùTom pressed a cloth to my chest, his hands shaking. ‚ÄúStay with us, mate. You‚Äôre losing too much blood.‚ÄùJim gunned the engine, the boat lurching toward shore. ‚ÄúHang on, Rodney. Hospital‚Äôs not far.‚ÄùI lay there, staring at the sky, the sun too bright. Pain rolled through me, hot and relentless. I could still feel the shark‚Äôs teeth, the crush of its jaws. My heart pounded, loud in my ears, like it was trying to escape. ‚ÄúTell Kay‚Ä¶‚Äù I whispered, my voice fading. ‚ÄúTell her I love her.‚Äù‚ÄúYou‚Äôll tell her yourself,‚Äù Tom snapped, his voice sharp but scared. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you bloody give up, Rodney.‚ÄùThe boat slammed into the beach, and medics were waiting, their voices a blur. ‚ÄúMale, 23, shark attack, severe chest trauma!‚Äù someone shouted. They lifted me onto a stretcher, my body screaming with every jolt. I saw faces‚Äîdivers, spectators, all staring, their mouths open. Then the ambulance doors closed, and I blacked out.I woke in the hospital, machines beeping, my body wrapped in bandages so tight I could barely move. My chest felt like it was on fire, every breath a knife. Kay was there, sitting by my bed, her face pale, her eyes red from crying. She grabbed my hand, her fingers warm against my cold skin.‚ÄúRodney,‚Äù she whispered, tears spilling over. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre alive.‚Äù‚ÄúBarely,‚Äù I croaked, my throat raw. I tried to smile, but it hurt. ‚ÄúTold you I‚Äôd come home.‚ÄùShe laughed, a shaky sound, and leaned her forehead against mine. ‚ÄúYou idiot. Don‚Äôt ever do that again.‚ÄùThe doctors came later, their faces grim. They said I was lucky‚Äîlucky the shark‚Äôs teeth missed my heart by inches, lucky it didn‚Äôt bite again. It had broken four ribs, punctured my lung, and torn my abdomen wide open. They‚Äôd spent hours stitching me back together, 462 stitches in all. My wetsuit had saved me, they said, holding my insides in until they could operate. I‚Äôd need months to recover, maybe longer.Lying in that hospital bed, I kept seeing those black eyes, feeling the shark‚Äôs rough skin under my hands. It was creepy, how something so alive could feel so dead inside. The ocean had always been my home, my playground, but now it felt like a stranger. Wild, unpredictable, full of teeth. I was scared to go back, but deep down, I knew I would. Not to hunt, not to prove anything, but to understand. That shark didn‚Äôt hate me‚Äîit just saw me as food. Maybe I could learn its world, see it differently.Years later, I‚Äôd build a life around sharks, studying them, showing others their power and beauty. But that day at Aldinga Beach, as I fought those jaws, all I knew was terror. The ocean had shown me its dark side, and I could still taste the blood in the water, feel the weight of death brushing past me. I‚Äôd survived, but I‚Äôd never be the same.





**""The Eel's Wrath"":**

The sun was barely up, casting a soft pink glow across the Caribbean sky. I stood on a weathered wooden dock on a tiny island, the kind where the air smells like salt and seaweed. The water lapped against the pilings, and our dive boat bobbed gently, loaded with tanks, fins, and spearguns. My friends Jake and Sarah were already aboard, laughing about something dumb. Jake, with his scruffy beard and sun-faded cap, was bragging about the grouper he‚Äôd speared last trip. Sarah, her short hair tucked under a bandana, was checking her underwater camera, muttering about light settings. I‚Äôd been diving for years, but today, a weird tightness gripped my chest. I chalked it up to too much coffee.‚ÄúYou gonna stand there all day or get on the boat?‚Äù Jake called, tossing me a water bottle. He had this way of acting like he owned the ocean, always cool, always in charge.‚ÄúChill, I‚Äôm coming,‚Äù I said, catching the bottle. Sarah glanced up, smirking. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let him boss you around. It‚Äôs a dive, not a race.‚ÄùI forced a laugh and climbed aboard, my flip-flops slapping the deck. The boat smelled like diesel and sunscreen. Our dive instructor, Marco, was at the helm, a lean guy with skin like leather from years in the sun. His blond hair was tied back, and he was sorting ropes with quick, practiced hands. He gave us the safety rundown, same as always. ‚ÄúStick together, check your gear, watch the currents. And don‚Äôt mess with the wildlife‚Äîespecially moray eels. They‚Äôre not out to get you, but they‚Äôve got teeth like razors if you piss ‚Äòem off.‚Äù‚ÄúGot it,‚Äù I said, nodding, but my mind was already drifting to the reef we‚Äôd dive. I pictured the coral towers, the schools of fish darting like confetti. The boat‚Äôs engine roared, and we cut through the glassy water toward the dive site, a spot Marco called ‚ÄúThe Garden‚Äù for its bright corals and deep drop-offs. The sea was so clear I could see the ocean floor thirty feet down‚Äîpatches of white sand, dark rocks, and bursts of color from sponges and anemones. It was like staring into another world.We suited up, the wetsuit clinging to my skin, heavy with the weight of the tank. Jake checked my regulator, giving me a thumbs-up. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt do anything stupid down there,‚Äù he said, half-joking.‚ÄúMe? Never,‚Äù I shot back, adjusting my mask. Sarah was already at the edge, camera strapped to her chest. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs make this quick before Jake starts measuring fish with his ego,‚Äù she said, and we all laughed. One by one, we rolled backward into the water.The ocean swallowed me, cold at first, then perfect. Sound faded to the steady hiss of my breathing and the faint bubble of my regulator. The reef stretched below, a maze of coral heads and swaying sea fans. Parrotfish nibbled at algae, their colors popping in the sunlight filtering through the water. Jake swam ahead, pointing out a barracuda hovering in the distance, its silver body sleek and menacing. Sarah‚Äôs camera flashed as she snapped shots of a turtle gliding by. I gripped my speargun, scanning for something worth catching‚Äîmaybe a snapper for dinner. Everything felt right, like we were part of the reef‚Äôs rhythm.Then I saw it. Tucked into a crevice of coral, a dark shape moved. A moray eel, its body thick and greenish-brown, coiled like a spring. Its head poked out, mouth opening and closing, showing a jagged line of teeth. It was huge, maybe five or six feet long, with eyes like black marbles that seemed to stare right through me. My pulse quickened. I‚Äôd seen eels before, but this one felt different, like it was daring me to come closer.‚ÄúHey, check this out,‚Äù I said through the comms, my voice muffled but clear.Jake‚Äôs voice crackled back. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt get too close, man. Those things don‚Äôt mess around.‚Äù‚ÄúI‚Äôm just looking,‚Äù I said, but I was already drifting toward it, speargun loose in my hands. The eel didn‚Äôt flinch, just kept those eyes on me. I don‚Äôt know what got into me‚Äîmaybe it was Jake‚Äôs confidence rubbing off, or maybe I wanted to prove I wasn‚Äôt scared. I raised the speargun, not planning to kill it, just to nudge it, see if it‚Äôd move. It was a dumb move, the kind you regret the second you act.‚ÄúDon‚Äôt!‚Äù Sarah‚Äôs voice cut in, sharp. But it was too late. I pulled the trigger.The spear shot forward, fast and silent, grazing the eel‚Äôs tail and pinning it to the coral. The eel went berserk, its body thrashing, twisting like a whip. Blood clouded the water, a dark red haze that stung my eyes. I froze, my breath loud and ragged, gripping the speargun like it could save me. The eel‚Äôs mouth snapped wildly, teeth glinting. Then it did something I‚Äôll never [unsee.It](http://unsee.It) turned on itself, jaws clamping down on its own tail where the spear had hit. With one vicious bite, it tore through its flesh, severing the pinned section. The tail, maybe a foot long, floated free, wriggling like it was still alive. Blood poured out, swirling in the current, and the eel‚Äînow shorter, wilder‚Äîshot out of the crevice, its body whipping through the water. Those black eyes locked on me for a split second, and I swear I felt pure rage.I screamed into my regulator, a muffled yell that echoed in my skull. I kicked backward, flailing, my fins hitting coral. ‚ÄúGet back!‚Äù Jake shouted, his hand grabbing my arm, yanking me toward him. Sarah was yelling too, her voice high and panicked. ‚ÄúWhat the hell did you do?!‚Äù‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know!‚Äù I gasped, my heart slamming against my ribs. The eel didn‚Äôt chase us, thank God. It darted into another crevice, disappearing into the shadows, leaving a trail of blood behind. The severed tail sank slowly, spinning in the current like a gruesome toy. My stomach churned, bile rising in my throat.‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going up. Now,‚Äù Jake said, his voice tight. We kicked for the surface, too fast, risking the bends but too freaked to care. The water felt heavier, like it was pressing me down. When we broke the surface, I ripped off my mask, gulping air, the sun blinding after the dim reef. The boat was a hundred yards off, and we swam hard, not talking, just breathing.On deck, I collapsed, my gear clattering. Jake peeled off his tank, his face pale, eyes wide. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been diving ten years,‚Äù he said, voice low. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen an eel do that. Bite its own damn tail off? That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs not right.‚ÄùSarah sat cross-legged, hugging her camera like it was a lifeline. Her hands shook as she spoke. ‚ÄúI read about this once, in a bio class. Some animals can drop parts of themselves to escape‚Äîautotomy, it‚Äôs called. Lizards do it with their tails. But an eel? That‚Äôs insane. It must‚Äôve been desperate.‚ÄùMarco had watched us scramble aboard, his usual easy grin gone. He listened as we spilled the story, tripping over each other‚Äôs words. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lucky it didn‚Äôt come for you,‚Äù he said, crossing his arms. ‚ÄúMorays are tough, but they don‚Äôt do that unless they‚Äôre cornered. You shot it, pinned it‚Äîwhat‚Äôd you expect? Never mess with an eel again, you understand?‚Äù‚ÄúI won‚Äôt,‚Äù I said, my voice barely there. Shame burned in my chest. I‚Äôd hurt a creature for no reason, just to see what it‚Äôd do. I felt small, stupid, like a kid who‚Äôd broken something precious.We didn‚Äôt dive again that day. Back at the hotel, the three of us sat on the patio, beers sweating in the heat. The sunset was gorgeous, all purples and golds, but I couldn‚Äôt enjoy it. My mind kept replaying the eel‚Äôs jaws, the crunch I imagined, the blood clouding the water. Jake tried to lighten things up, cracking jokes about ‚Äúpsycho eels,‚Äù but his laugh was hollow.‚ÄúYou diving tomorrow?‚Äù he asked, peeling the label off his bottle.I stared at the table, the wood grain blurring. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. I‚Ä¶ I might sit it out.‚ÄùSarah reached over, squeezing my hand. ‚ÄúNo one‚Äôs gonna judge you. That was heavy. The ocean‚Äôs not going anywhere.‚ÄùI nodded, but I felt exposed, like the eel had seen something in me I didn‚Äôt want to face. That night, I lay awake in my room, the ceiling fan clicking. When I closed my eyes, I saw those black eyes, unblinking, accusing. I got up, grabbed my phone, and started scrolling diving forums, desperate for answers. A few posts mentioned eels acting crazy under stress‚Äîone diver said he‚Äôd seen an eel bite a spear in half‚Äîbut nothing matched what I‚Äôd seen. One comment stuck with me: ‚ÄúThe ocean doesn‚Äôt care about you. Respect it, or it‚Äôll chew you up.‚ÄùThe rest of the trip, I stayed on land, walking the beach, watching waves crash. Jake and Sarah dove again, came back with stories of lionfish and a friendly octopus, but I could tell they were still rattled. They didn‚Äôt push me to join them, and I was grateful.Back home, weeks later, I still can‚Äôt shake it. I dream about the eel, its body twisting, its teeth flashing. Sometimes I‚Äôm the one pinned, trapped in the coral, and it‚Äôs coming for me. My speargun‚Äôs still in the garage, untouched. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll dive again. The ocean‚Äôs beautiful, a world of color and life, but it‚Äôs raw, unforgiving. I learned that the hard way, and I‚Äôll never forget the day I saw a creature so desperate to live it tore itself apart to get free.",1,1746766427.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

So I'm Michael 34m my wife Amanda 32 fm had an affair. With my best friend James me and James met in college I was studying business. And he was studying IT I was in a coffee shop grabbing coffee.when he bumped into me spilling the coffee everywhere. he asked how much the stains would be to clean but I just said I would go to my dorm and. Change we started talking we immediately clicked anyway he invited me. To a party where I met Amanda a hot blonde who could make you feel special just by talking to you I went up and introduced my self of course my words decided not to come out right and said something like do you live near hear. But she just laughed and told me I was cute and gave me her number we started dating 2 months later. We got along really well after a year of dating I told her that after I finished college I would propose to. Her cheesy I know but still we got married 3 years later in a massive venue she picked out we invited Friends and family that's when James and Amanda met they seamed to get along well just fine during the reception I saw Amanda looking. Just a bit to close at James when she saw me she quickly turned her head after 2 years I finally got a high paying job 6 figures witch came with a bonus that I spent on a down payment on a house Amanda at. First seamed thrilled with the house but she started to change suddenly we use to let each other use are phones if we needed them but now if I walked into a room she put it face down we stopped having sex when I asked her about it she said she was exhausted from work or she wasn't in the mood . Now I'm not an idiot I could tell she was pulling away one day after a meeting got rescheduled at the last minute I came home when I came in I heard her on the phone with somebody she said hay you still ready for tonight yep your husband still clueless oh please Michael's got no clue he has money sure but he has no ambition I felt physically sick I turned around and started to drive my hands shook so badly I had to pull over then I got. A text from her saying hay honey how was your meeting. It felt fake 3 fucking years with this woman if she wanted to play games I would show her what happens when her clueless husband plays games. I went home she was on the couch scrolling through her phone hey how did it go she said good I said let her think I was clueless that night when in bed I started staring to think about are relationship had it all been a lie I took her phone opened it with her finger print and scrolled through messages with her and James what I found made me want to puke her and James sending nude photos of each other I took screenshots and placed. Her phone back where I found it the next day I found a divorce lawyer John Adams the best divorce lawyer in the city I asked him what my options were he told me that with my evidence she won't be in a good place he told me. To document everything make her think I was still clueless so I did I started to sleep in the guest room after 6 weeks of gathering evidence i waited for the right moment and that came soon after when I told her I had a business trip when in reality I checked into a hotel and waited then I went back to the house and saw James car parked in the driveway I opened the door and saw clothes scattered everywhere. And when I got to the bedroom I saw them going at it James on top I started to record it after 2 minutes of recording I stopped.it they didn't even notice me at first then he turned and saw me his face went white he had the audacity to say it's not what it looks like and he could explain the next moment my fist connected to his nose he started to bleed you. Have 5 minutes to get your shit together and leave after they left I went to bed and called my lawyer surprisingly the process was fairly quick. Considering I owned the house and my car she said she would sign if . There was a chance we could try again someday after she signed she moved out and I got the house my car and personal assets.

1kia7tl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sadnesslaughs/comments/1kia7tl/youve_been_shopping_for_a_new_house_and_the/,"You've been shopping for a new house, and the realtor is willing to give you this house for free. The catch? You have to stay in the house for a month. Seems easy, until you find that, every day you wake up, the house has given you a new rule to follow.","‚ÄúIs this a Mr. Beast challenge? He won‚Äôt jump out of the walls or something while I‚Äôm sleeping, will he?‚Äù I asked the realtor, being wary of anything that‚Äôs free. The realtor, a man in his late sixties, with deep brown eyes that looked like they had seen the very creation of the universe, scrunched his nose, causing his whirly moustache to flinch.

‚ÄúI do not know of a Beast. I assure ye, he will not be in ye walls.‚Äù He said, with a slight accent that was hard to pinpoint. Somewhere between French and Scottish? It was a sound that defied description, a bizarre mystery that left my mind scrambling to make sense of its chaotic beauty.

‚ÄúRight. Right.‚Äù I nodded, dropping my pen. ‚ÄúOops. Dropped my pen.‚Äù I got onto the floor of his office, searching for a hidden camera, only to stare at the crusty toenails of the older gentlemen who had kicked off his shoes halfway through our negotiations. I bucked with the energy of an enraged horse, my back hitting the table, flinging his papers into the air. ‚ÄúOw.‚Äù When I wormed my way back into my seat, he raised an eyebrow.

‚ÄúDid ye acquire ze pen?‚Äù He asked, staring at my empty hands.

‚ÄúPen?‚Äù I murmured, a little dazed from the unlicensed spinal adjustment the table had performed on me.

He exhaled. ‚ÄúHere.‚Äù He handed me his pen, and I signed the contract. ‚ÄúAz I said. You cannot leave ze house. Ye must stay inside for da month.‚Äù

‚ÄúEasy enough. I‚Äôm a hermit, anyway. Bloop bloop.‚Äù I laughed, placing my fists before my eyes, in an action I hoped imitated hermit crab eyes, even if I had forgotten what they looked like. When he didn‚Äôt laugh, I gave another small. ‚ÄúBloop?‚Äù Hoping that might get him laughing.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll show ye to ze door.‚Äù He said. Making it clear he didn‚Äôt find it funny.

Arriving at my new home was an odd sensation. I had come to the realtor with a budget of $150 a week. For that sort of money, I expected him to show me one of his cheaper cardboard boxes, the ones that crumble if so much as an ant leans on them. To end up with a fully furnished house felt too good to be true. Sure, I couldn‚Äôt leave it for a month, but that suited me. I could draw for the entire month, and hope I got enough commission money to afford some food.

I set my things up, admiring my slice of heaven. It was a single-story house, with a living room, a small kitchen that only had a toaster and microwave, and a bathroom/bedroom. It wasn‚Äôt grand, but it was enough. How much more did one person need? What else could I even ask for? Maybe an oven? Though, an oven was kind of pointless for someone that didn‚Äôt know how to cook anything harder than a toasted sandwich.

I set up my computer and carefully arranged my anime figures before deciding I had earned a rest. Throwing myself onto the couch while wiggling my limited edition Goku and Luffy eating contest collaboration figure. ‚ÄúI told mom this was worth buying. It‚Äôs an investment. Even if I won‚Äôt sell it.‚Äù Before I could place my prized figure on the coffee table, I heard a bump. A heavy sound, as if something was going to crash through my roof. I paused, waiting for another sound, only to hear nothing.

‚ÄúWeird.‚Äù I shrugged, setting the figure down. As I walked to my bedroom, there was a weird chill in the air, the icy breeze becoming overbearing as I hugged my shoulders. ‚ÄúBrr.. I need to get a heater.‚Äù Thankfully, the blankets in the bed were enough to fend off the wave of cold air, and soon I was asleep.

BABUNK. BABUNK. BABUNK.

I groaned, the sound followed by a fit of heavy breathing, as if a drooling Pitbull stood at the foot of my bed. ‚ÄúMr. Beast?‚Äù I mumbled, wiping the drool from my lips, before hugging my pillow again. ‚ÄúNot now.‚Äù

BABUNK. BABUNK. My bed shook, threatening to throw me out of it. I gripped the mattress and spun my body around, facing what I expected to be the internet celebrity. ‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù

This beast certainly wasn‚Äôt a MR. Well, it could have been. I didn‚Äôt want to assume. Whatever it was, it hunched over my bed, its heavy body being lifted with each of its strained breaths. Its brown and green skin the color of rot, smelling like a mix of gasoline and cinnamon. The creature had no hair, instead its scalp leaked a slick yellowish liquid that dangled down its face like slime, covering the pale eyes of its face. It grinned when it saw me, its sharp teeth vibrating like the blades of a chainsaw.

It wore a heavy sack over its body, one with holes for its meaty arms and legs. The longer it stared at me, the wider its grin got. Its grin reaching around the back of its head, almost as if it would continue to grow until it ran out of flesh to cover. With the creeping figure watching over me, I knew what I had to do. I hopped out of bed, rushing to my computer.

‚ÄúFinally. Inspiration. My sleep paralysis demon is helping me.‚Äù I said, tapping away at my keyboard, logging into my computer. ‚ÄúOk, ok. Um, how did it look?‚Äù I looked over my shoulder, finding the creature drooling behind me. It‚Äôs tall, heavy body bent over my shoulder, watching me. No matter how much it drooled, the liquid never hit me or the floor, vanishing as it dripped past its chest. ‚ÄúExactly. It looks like that.‚Äù

I started drawing, using my art programs to delicately construct the beast. I added some artistic flare to it, giving it a stronger build, one that looked more threatening while also enhancing the size of its teeth. When I was done, the sun twinkled through the blinds, burning my tired pupils. ‚ÄúDone. What do you think?‚Äù I turned around, seeing nothing behind me. ‚ÄúWeird?‚Äù

Later that day, while I was putting away my ordered groceries, I found a letter. ‚ÄúDraw more.‚Äù It demanded. I peeked through the window, wondering if someone had broken into my house to give me a commission request. Though this wasn‚Äôt really a request, just a note to draw more. ‚ÄúDraw more what?‚Äù

BABUNK. The noise rang out from my bedroom.

‚ÄúTHE BEAST.‚Äù I clapped. ‚ÄúMy new inspiration.‚Äù Just like that, I was back at my desk, drawing up new scenes with the beast fighting various horror movie heroes. Of course, the beast was winning these fights. When I finished for the day, my stomach rumbled, telling me to eat something. ‚ÄúMm. I should post these online before I grab a snack.‚Äù With that, I posted the drawings on my profile, and made some noodles before going to bed.

No beasts or Mr. Beasts snuck into my room that night, and I was a little disappointed. I was hoping to get another look at the creature, wanting to use it for more of my art. Oh well, I still had my memories of it. The next day, the note on the counter told me to shower and do my laundry. I sniffed my armpit and gagged. The note was right. I needed a shower.

After cleaning up and having breakfast, I did more drawings, while also discovering that my posts online were popping off. I was semi-internet famous for the day. At least I would be until someone uploaded a new cat video, sending me to the realm of forgotten artists. Wanting to capitalize on the success, I created more art of the beast, until my fingers were numb.

This repeated for the rest of the week with the notes demands being as follows.

Wednesday- Draw!

Thursday- Eat healthy.

Friday- Sleep eight hours.

Saturday- Throw out old milk.

Sunday- Laugh at man.

‚ÄúLaugh at man? Like the concept of man? I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm enough of a philosopher to do that. What is a man? A featherless chicken?‚Äù I laughed, confident I had messed that up. Then my door opened, and I saw the realtor and a lovely couple walk into my home. Only for all of them to freeze when they saw me in my Dragon Ball Z boxers.

‚ÄúYe should be dead.‚Äù The realtor hissed.

‚ÄúHuh? Oh, no. You can live like this and have a moderately healthy life. Frozen pizza‚Äôs healthy if you eat a ham and pineapple occasionally.‚Äù I said, before stopping. ‚ÄúWait, why should I be dead?‚Äù

‚ÄúZE CREATURE.‚Äù He stomped his foot, only for the couple to look at each other.

‚ÄúThe creature?‚Äù The husband said. ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt tell us about a creature.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. You told us this was a lovely home that comes with a terrible secret.‚Äù The wife added, both of them staring at the realtor, who was slowly going mad.

‚ÄúZE CREATURE IS THE SECRET YA FOOLS.‚Äù

‚ÄúFools? I won‚Äôt be called a fool by a real estate agent and his ‚Äòcreature‚Äô.‚Äù The woman said, dragging her husband out of my house. I guess they assumed I was the creature? I tried to find something to cover my boxers with, eventually using a couch cushion.

‚ÄúSo, ze creature? What‚Äôs ze creature?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúAre ze mocking me?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so?‚Äù

‚ÄúHave ye not seen it?‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, this is a Mr. Beast challenge? I knew it. Ok, bring him and my money out! I‚Äôm ready for it.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. I mean‚Ä¶.‚Äù He paused, pointing at my computer screen. ‚ÄúWHAT IZ THAT?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, it‚Äôs my original character. The beast. It‚Äôs inspired by my sleep paralysis creature.‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúThat is no sleep paralysis, creature. It‚Äôs ze creature. It should have swallowed ye whole. Gave ye gruesome tasks.‚Äù He couldn‚Äôt believe it. Walking through my livingroom, searching the area. ‚ÄúNo dead bodies? No unholy symbols?‚Äù He snatched the last note I got, reading it.

I laughed at him. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs funny. You thought I was getting haunted by some evil monster? I just keep finding these notes that make me do helpful things. Wait, that wasn‚Äôt a sleep paralysis monster?‚Äù I froze, rushing to close my bedroom door. I knew in my heart that a closed door wouldn‚Äôt stop it, but it felt more reassuring than staring into the darkness of my room. I would need a good hour or two before I was ready to confront the fact I had been blissfully ignoring an actual monster.

‚ÄúDO NOT LAUGH AT ME!‚Äù He fumed, crunching his fists. He opened and shut his mouth, imitating a hungry fish, only to close it before any words came out. He couldn‚Äôt kick me out, and I think he knew that, swallowing his curses as he walked to the door. ‚ÄúZe beast will turn on you. LIKE IT TURNED ON ME.‚Äù He slammed the door shut, and I laughed even harder.

‚ÄúHeh. Nah, we‚Äôre cool. Aren‚Äôt we beast? Um, aren‚Äôt we beast?‚Äù I asked, watching my bedroom door rumble. A note slipped out with a simple response.

‚ÄúWe are cool. Like drawing. Like you.‚Äù

‚ÄúAw, I like you too. I should get back to drawing. Hopefully, I got some donations today. Who knows, maybe I can turn this into a show or movie. I‚Äôll call it, The beast games. Shit, that‚Äôs taken. We‚Äôll workshop it.‚Äù I said, sitting back at my desk, returning to my work.",7,1746765729.0,Sadnesslaughs,3,0.9,False

I mostly do drawing and painting. Since I have my own place I'm free to hang up whatever I like, and some of my decor is my own artwork. When I don't have some other subject in mind I usually default to drawing this person who doesn't exist. She doesn't really have a name or a backstory, at least none that I've given her. Some of my friends have named her variously throughout the years. Anyways, like I said this person doesn't exist in real life, but for some reason I've always been able to see her face very clearly in my head. I draw head and shoulders portraits of her or draw her in locations like coffee shops or walking through the woods. This might sound crazy but sometimes I think I'm channeling the spirit of my older sister who was never really alive and died as a stillbirth. People have told me the character vaguely looks like me, and it feels cathartic to draw her. So yeah I'm not like crazy obsessed but at any given time I rotate maybe 3-4 pieces of this subject through my place.

Anyways I started seeing this woman I'll call Jessica and when I had her over one of the first things she commented on was the pieces of this subject. It seemed like mostly curiosity at first but eventually when she learned the extent of how many pieces I've made I guess she got uncomfortable about it. She said it was weird even when I said it was no one who was real. She said it seemed like I was trying to manifest this woman into my life or something and she couldn't even vaguely see herself as being the subject so she couldn't spin it as it being her in some way. She said my home was basically a shrine to a woman who wasn't anyone actually important in my life. I kinda got her point and said I could take them down but I don't want to suppress myself creatively. I also said I would love to make art of her. We ended the conversation on uncertain terms as I guess Jessica doesn't want me drawing this figure anymore and maybe even wants me to store all the pieces I've made somewhere not close. I feel closer to my art than I do Jessica at the moment but I'm wondering if this would be a common dealbreaker, so AITAH?",2,1746765445.0,AITAH,5,1.0,False

I‚Äôm moving to Guam at the beginning of June and thought I‚Äôd shoot my shot at making some friends before I arrive. Just looking to meet people around my age with similar interests.

I‚Äôm a 29y/o guy, a nurse, and I‚Äôve got a 2 year old Shiba Inu. I‚Äôm into tennis, fishing, rock climbing, cycling, and cooking (i suck at cooking). I also love anime, video games, reading, and traveling.

Personality-wise, I‚Äôm somewhere between a chill coffee shop type of vibe and an occasional nightlife type of person. I‚Äôm into EDM and went to EDC Las Vegas last year. 

I‚Äôm naturally curious and love exploring new places. I just got back from Colombia, and I‚Äôm hoping to travel around nearby Asian countries while I‚Äôm living in Guam‚Äîmainly to explore, but also because I‚Äôm a big foodie.

No matter how many times I‚Äôve talked to them about it they can‚Äôt be bothered to try to be even remotely courteous while I‚Äôm trying to sleep.

They don‚Äôt respect me, and they don‚Äôt respect my property. Just this morning one of them destroyed my only coffee pot and has yet to own up to it (so I don‚Äôt even know which one did it). They eat my clearly labeled food even though I never get into their stuff. 

That‚Äôs it I guess. I‚Äôm fucking tired. It‚Äôs 10:30PM, I have work at 7:30AM, and these people are playing guitars right next to me, slamming doors, shouting, the works‚Ä¶ 

It it just so strange to me how, for so many people, it is an absolutely foreign concept to respect other people‚Äôs time, space, and things. It‚Äôs not like these people *have* to play music and shit in the room right next to me. They have a whole house to go to, including a nice outdoor patio, and their own room which is a story below me! 

I‚Äôve tried to ask them to keep the noise down while I‚Äôm asleep several times to no avail. I avoid making it obvious, but I am beyond excited to be leaving soon and to have my own place. Somewhere where, at least my loud neighbors can be separated from me by a proper wall, opposed to a door frame. 

80% of this is just me being pissed they screwed up my coffee pot, and that fixing it will come out of my own pocket. Anyone know a decent place to buy a new medium-small moka pot from? lol. ",1,1746765289.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

# What Is RSD Todd‚Äôs Women?

Let‚Äôs break it down: **RSD Todd‚Äôs Women** is one of the most comprehensive dating and pickup programs Todd Valentine ever created under the Real Social Dynamics (RSD) banner. It‚Äôs a deep-dive into the art of opening, attracting, and connecting with women‚Äîwith a strong focus on real-world mindset and behavioral dynamics. Think of it like your personal bootcamp on how to show up as a high-value man without needing cheesy lines or fake confidence.

# Who‚Äôs Todd, and Why Should You Care?

Todd Valentine isn‚Äôt just some random guy with a mic. He was one of RSD‚Äôs top coaches before parting ways with the company. In fact, he was creating solid, strategic programs long before some of the other big names showed up. And *RSD Todd‚Äôs Women* is a culmination of his experience working with guys in-field over years. If you‚Äôve ever watched Todd‚Äôs videos, you know he‚Äôs not about hype‚Äîhe‚Äôs about results, logic, and laser-sharp breakdowns of how social dynamics actually play out.

# When Should You Watch It?

Honestly? Right now. If you‚Äôre struggling with approaching women, freezing in conversations, or just feel like your vibe isn‚Äôt landing, this is the kind of material that flips that script. The sooner you internalize this stuff, the sooner you stop second-guessing yourself in the moment.

# Where Does It Apply?

Everywhere. Clubs. Daygame. Social circles. Even casual events or coworker parties. Todd focuses on *universal frameworks* you can calibrate to different environments. Whether you‚Äôre approaching a loud party girl in a Vegas club or a soft-spoken bookworm in a coffee shop, *RSD Todd‚Äôs Women* shows you how to adapt and still be *you*‚Äîbut better.

# Why Is It Worth It?

Because Todd doesn‚Äôt just teach tactics‚Äîhe teaches thinking. He breaks down things like the **opener setting the tone**, **false time constraints**, **direct vs indirect approaches**, and **how to pass shit tests** like a seasoned pro. And it‚Äôs not just surface-level talk. He gives you the why behind every move. You‚Äôre not memorizing lines‚Äîyou‚Äôre understanding human behavior. It‚Äôs not magic, but it damn sure feels like it when it clicks.

# How Does It Work?

Todd teaches in a super straightforward way. You‚Äôll learn how to calibrate energy based on a woman‚Äôs vibe (high-energy vs low-energy approaches), how to create spontaneous conversations without overthinking, and why assuming ‚Äúthis is going to work‚Äù changes *everything*. He explains things like:

* **Opener + 20 seconds**: The make-or-break moment.
* **Conversational funnel**: Move from casual to sexual without being pushy.
* **Using her responses** to keep the energy flowing.
* **Emotional triggers** and how to become her focus *right now*.

He also covers the internal game: owning your frame, not chasing, and being the guy who *already belongs* wherever he goes.

In a nutshell, **RSD Todd‚Äôs Women** is less about lines and more about *living like the guy women are naturally drawn to*. It‚Äôs strategic, it‚Äôs sharp, and if you apply what he teaches, it can genuinely shift how you relate to women.",1,1746764603.0,ThorneStudying,1,1.0,False

I remember when I was younger, peaking into writing subs and seeing a letter someone wrote about their ex getting married or having a kid or some other major life event with another soul. I would always naively think to myself ‚Äúhow is this person not over their ex? Clearly their ex is. They‚Äôre getting married. Surely so much time has passed, they were able to meet and develop a whole life with another person‚Äù 

Well here I am, writing about you. Your wedding was the other day, and although I can thankfully say that finding out wasn‚Äôt as heartbreaking or soul crushing as I thought it would be, I‚Äôd be lying to myself if I said that it didn‚Äôt make me feel‚Ä¶ different. 

I‚Äôm happy for you, I really am. You deserve a loving and happy life more than anyone I‚Äôve ever met. Yet the way things went between us, the way the universe conspired against us, I can‚Äôt help but lean into my delusion coping mechanism of ‚Äúlife is like the movie‚Äù Thinking about how we should have ended up together. Maybe we run into each other during a mutually timed vacation and we start off resenting each other but eventually build up a clich√© appreciation for each other until we realized that it was fate that brought us back. Maybe I‚Äôm doing some important business trip at a job I‚Äôm clearly under qualified for and we bump into each other at a coffee shop. Either way,  that didn‚Äôt happen. Why didn‚Äôt it happen? 

I loved you in ways I didn‚Äôt think a person could love someone. You told me how I‚Äôm the only person who really understands you and that talking to me feels like talking to a soulmate, and I couldn‚Äôt help but agree. So if the writers made us so good for each other and they drove a wedge between us with working in different states, rather than something that happens in the real world like cheating or us falling out of love, why would they do that? 

We both loved each other so much. We both wanted nothing more than to be with each other. I called you a year after not talking, you had been seeing someone for almost a year now. Yet someone we talked for hours ever day on the phone. You revealed that you were in a relationship but still loved me and needed the night to think about whether you would break up with him and date me. That was unexpected. Almost as unexpected as the cold way you told me that you were choosing him.  The way you told me somehow hurt worse than the actual decision. 

So why did you choose him? You didn‚Äôt like him very much.  He didn‚Äôt have what we had. He didn‚Äôt have that bond that we have.  But you chose him. And now you‚Äôve agreed to spend the rest of your life with him, someone who you told me so many times doesn‚Äôt compete with our bond, yet somehow you‚Äôre spending the early days of the rest of your life with him, and I‚Äôm here. Writing this letter. Wondering why I feel different.  It‚Äôs not sadness, it‚Äôs not anger or envy. I just feel different. 

Is this what it feels like, when the they write you off the show? Is my life just out of the camera view now. Because I can‚Äôt imagine living this movie life without you.

I had to take my wife to the emergency room yesterday. As soon as the staff saw her they immediately rushed her back and doctors everywhere within moments. Well, turns out her liver is failing and that's caused her kidneys to stop functioning and she has a blood infection. She was admitted overnight and today I was told that the doctors were worried she wouldn't make it through the night. I have been terrified and so upset constantly. She is delirious and can't really hold a conversation or know what's going on, with so many tubes and needles connected to her. It seems (I hope) that she will make it but may need a liver transplant. I've admittedly been a huge mess about all of this, cycling between stoic determination and being a blubbering mess.  However, my (largely male) friends and family have stepped up in a huge way. In the last twelve hours I've had:

* A friend reaching out multiple times to remind me he is available to help out in any way he can.
* A friend who has already been someone who I can trust to open up about my worries invite me out to dinner and coffee on Saturday whenever I feel safe leaving the hospital for a bit so I have a chance to talk/vent if I want to.
* My son (15, she's his step mom) walk in on me crying and telling me it only makes sense I'm crying and that I shouldn't hold in the emotions, they were valid and I should let them out. (so proud of him about this)
* Another friend offer to bring home cooked meals for me and my son to have while my wife is in the hospital.
* Yet another couple of friends (husband and wife) send me a $100 uber eats gift card since we aren't going to have time or energy to make meals, as well as call me to have someone to talk to.
* I also need to include my mom, who has been constantly checking up, willing to talk, and making sure I have everything I need.

I'm still so scared about my wife, I don't know what I would do if she was gone. But seeing all my friends and family step up and show understanding, empathy, and assistance has really shown me how lucky I am to have such a great group of people surrounding me.",36,1746764336.0,GuyCry,4,0.97,False
