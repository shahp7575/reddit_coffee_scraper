1j9td1d,https://www.reddit.com/r/CISA/comments/1j9td1d/passed_cisa_1st_attempt/,Passed CISA @ 1st attempt,"Hi,

I have just passed CISA, still cannot believe I did, I'm not sure how it happened. I keep looking for proof online, honestly, it feels like a mirage/hallucination. It did say ""passed"" on the last exam screen, I swear, but should I be able to find the proof somewhere else...? PSI? ISACA? Anyway. We'll see in 10 days.

1. Absolutely horrid experience with online proctored PSI exam. NEVER DO THAT, unless you absolutely have no other choice. I made this painful mistake and now will have PTSD for the rest of my life. The process was miserable, humiliating, technically flawed and just plain excessive. I've taken other professional exams online at home, I know what I'm talking about. Just don't ever do it. Please, no.

2. Took me around 2,5-3 weeks to cram the knowledge in. I was on a vacation. I have basically spent 8 working hours a day studying (ngl, procrastination and doom-scrolling was part of that). So it is doable. I work in technical QA/UAT, no real Cybersec experience. I have passed the free ISC2 CC exam in September, so it helped (ISC2 CC exam was a breeze compared to CISA, tho!).

3. Used Hemang Doshi's paper book and associated packt.link online resources. Really enjoyed doing end of chapter tests, somehow it felt very motivating. 
Of course, went through the ISACA QAE database. I have concentrated on expert-level questions (you can make custom tests there). Not that I didn't make any mistakes on Easy and Moderate, but it felt like I was learning more. My average was around 67% day before exam (only expert level questions). I prefer short tests, 20 q total, 4 each domain, study mode (showing answers right away). 

4. Given all that, real exam today had nothing to do with QAE. Maybe 5 questions were remotely similar. I felt like playing roulette a lot of the time. But question structure was similar, so I was psychologically prepared (I would definitely freak out if I hadn't seen similar convoluted questions before). Quite a number of questions about DATA LOSS PREVENTION, QA, PROJECT PORTFOLIOS, PKI (especially digital signatures). Just a few questions on network security (lucky me, not my strongest topic) i.e. ports, hosts, switches etc. With an hour left I had 75 flagged questions lol. But I quit checking them after the first dozen, because I was physically and emotionally exhausted (see 1st point) and started overthinking and changing initial aswers..

5. My best advice: read the question + every answer separately. Sometimes you can FEEL that it just sounds right gramatically even if you have no idea what it says (I wish I had a thesaurus on some questions, I'm not a native English speaker). Also, highlight the main WORD (i.e. CONCERN, RECOMMENDATION, CONSIDERATION, BEST/MOST/LEAST, etc.) ISACA just loooooves to catch you on those, therefore sometimes the most obvious answer that totally makes sense is not the correct one.  

3. I'm exhausted - physically this was very challenging. I have no idea why they have to make it so rough. No water, no food, no potty break, don't look there, don't sit like that, don't touch your face, don't move your mouth... My exam was delayed due to technical issues with PSI, so I was literally shaking after almost 5h of what felt like torture. Very unpleasant overall experience (mostly PSI fault, ISACA was as awful as expected). So try to relax before exam, have your coffee, your smoke, your alone-time AND make sure to use the potty 100%.  

Thanks for listening to my ted-talk. Imma sleep for 12 hours now. Wish y'all best of luck. 

Love,

She had also gone through a divorce twice and had two kids like me, but hers were adults. We hit it off instantly. I was so impressed with her ambition and achievements being so successful in her work. She had two jobs and a doctor degree. That was very impressive when we got together I was already retired and was living a very simple life. I was very upfront and honest with her from the start. I told her I didn‚Äôt have a college degree, that I was retired, and still had children living at home, so didn‚Äôt have the freedom to travel when I wanted to. She said she didn‚Äôt care, but admired me being such a great father and provider for my children. Everything went great, and we felt madly in love. So the time came that I proposed to her with a beautiful ring. We both cried and she exepted. But right after engagement, I could see she was having second thoughts. After a few months, I noticed her pulling away so we had a talk. She mentioned that she was afraid to get married again after two failed marriages and I told her that we didn‚Äôt have to, but it was away for me to combine the two families together. It‚Äôs time went by. I noticed her spending less time with me. I started feeling like I wasn‚Äôt much of a priority to her. One Sunday she came to my house and I was gonna prepare a meal. I sat her down and said we need to talk. I told her how much I loved her and that spending one day a week was just not enough for me that I needed to spend more time with her. I assumed that this would lead to a compromise that will suit both of us. To my surprise, she ended the relationship and I was completely heartbroken. Fast-forward two years and we decided to meet for coffee. She made small talk at first but after 30 minutes, I said I wanna talk about the break up. She explained her side of the story and even though it hurt, I understood. When we said our goodbyes, I sent her a text saying it was nice seeing you again and I feel better after the conversation. She didn‚Äôt reply until many hours later I said it was nice seeing me also and then ended the text with until next time.

When she announced her engagement, she also announced the date which isn't far off and had locked in venues meaning from the get-go plans are in full swing.

I am of the opinion that whatever the couple wants for their day, they get.  Years ago she was in my wedding because I wam marrying into her brother just like my one only brother was a groomsmen.  I should note that the very day I started dating her brother she said, ""I'm fine with it so long as I'm a bridesmaid."" At the time I didn't think it was a joke.  I first met my husband when were in elementary school.  I'm a year older so we really weren't on each other's radar, not hanging out with with each other and our paths connected only after I had moved back from overseas and him going to uni and we were back in our hometown at the right place, right time.  Cue Hallmark vibes.  His sister on the other hand, I did go to high school with.  We weren't close friends, I'd say friendly acquaintances as we ran in similar circles.  Her personality was.. difficult.  She came across as an angry person, slowly and bark.   When it came to dating her brother, I had to mentally prepare to have a SIL dynamic that I wouldn't necessarily choose for myself.  At the start there were some hiccups, but we've forged a peaceful path.  We aren't close, but we can have the occasional lunch or coffee and I do enjoy that.  She is a loving aunt to my kids.

This is where I may be the asshole.  Since wedding plans were apparently in full swing and since I knew she possibly could be planning a bridal party, a few days later, I tried to give a heads up that while I am willing to help beforehand, that the day of I wish to be available to be hands on to parent my kids (if kids are invited).  I was careful to articulate that I am not presuming that I even would be asked especially as I am a pre-existing SIL and she's gaining more SIL's with her upcoming wedding nor am I assuming kids will be there, this is just IF she was thinking about those things while planning.  I even said feel free to take it or leave what I was saying.  I was trying to dot my I'd and cross my T's.  I have a neurodivergent child with diagnoses labelled ""severe.""  The reality is that they will need one-on-one support.  If I was standing up at the altar and if my husband were up there too, it could fall on the bride's parents to reign in their grandchild.  We aren't close to anyone else there who knows how to work with my child.  His behaviours can be disruptive so for him to be there, he needs a trusted adult to help guide him through the day.  All I am asking is to be free to deal with him so it doesn't fall on the parents or my husband's shoulders as it's his sister. 

At first our text exchange seemed pleasant but the next day she seemed upset with me for bringing up her wedding (I guess they are only allowed to initiate anything wedding related which I would totally understand if it wasn't 5 months away) and accused me of ""trying to plan the wedding.""  My motivation was just to try to be helpful by preventing my ND child from causing a distraction.  I am not making this wedding about my kid nor am I asking for any special accommodations beyond allowing me to be hands on.  She also knows my kid well so it should seem like a no-brainer.  I just wanted to give a courtesy heads up as they are planning.  I figured the nephew of the bride and SIL aren't key players here so it wasn't all too serious and the level of anger caught me off guard.  

I apologized for hurt feelings in any possible miswording in what I said, but clarified I didn't mean to overstep.  My husband has read the messages and doesn't think I did anything wrong and stood up for me.   I explained than when you hear of people trying to take over we are talking about dress input, location, colours, aesthetic...etc.  I wasn't trying to make it about me.. I'm literally asking to be invisible so I can make sure her nephew and my son can handle the day and the focus remains on where it should- the couple.

I am very excited for my SIL and was hurt that I was accused of being a guestzilla essentially.  I knew there was a 50-50 chance I could be asked (especially as my SIL struggles to make and keep friends due to her personality).  I figure having that info a. would make the planning process easier with the info on the table and b. Sensible when we are talking about a disabled kid who I have learned is invited.",3,1741809011.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,1,1.0,False

1j9syfc,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1j9syfc/tifu_by_not_trusting_my_gut_and_it_may_have/,TIFU By Not Trusting My Gut And It May Have Costed Me a Friend.,"So, I‚Äôve been debating whether or not to share this because it‚Äôs one of those situations that still makes me cringe when I think about it. But I‚Äôm hoping sharing it will not only help me process everything, but maybe it can help someone else out there who might be in a similar situation.

A little backstory: I (29, F) have a group of friends I‚Äôve known since college. We all have very different lives now ‚Äî some of us are married, others are single, a few have kids, but we‚Äôve stayed close over the years. For the sake of this post, let‚Äôs call my best friend ‚ÄúMaya‚Äù (28, F). We‚Äôve been inseparable for years, and I genuinely thought I knew her better than anyone else.

Maya has always been the life of the party, super outgoing, and the kind of person everyone gravitates toward. She‚Äôs also the type who tends to overshare, which sometimes gets her in trouble. She‚Äôs had a history of... let‚Äôs just say ‚Äúquestionable‚Äù choices when it comes to dating. I‚Äôm not one to judge ‚Äî everyone has their own journey, right? So, when Maya started dating this guy, ""Jake"" (30, M), I thought it was just another short-term fling. They met at a bar, and I had a weird vibe about him from the start. He wasn‚Äôt rude or anything, but there was just something off about him. I can‚Äôt even pinpoint it ‚Äî it‚Äôs like my gut was screaming, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt trust him.‚Äù But Maya was head over heels for him, and I didn‚Äôt want to come across as judgmental, so I kept my thoughts to myself. BIG MISTAKE.

At first, everything seemed normal. He was charming, he‚Äôd come to hang out with our group of friends, and he was always polite. But there were subtle red flags. I started noticing how possessive Jake was over Maya. Little comments like, ‚ÄúOh, you don‚Äôt need to go out with them tonight, I‚Äôd rather spend time with you,‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhy are you texting her so much? Is she more important than me?‚Äù It started to get uncomfortable, and I started to feel like Maya was changing. She would cancel plans with us to hang out with him, she started dressing differently, and she‚Äôd often defend his behavior when we‚Äôd bring it up.

At this point, I should have said something. I knew something wasn‚Äôt right. But I didn‚Äôt. I kept quiet, convinced that I didn‚Äôt know the full story, that I should just trust her decisions because, hey, she‚Äôs an adult. Maybe I was just being overprotective.

Then came the day that really shook me.

One of our friends, ‚ÄúLena,‚Äù (27, F), came over to my apartment to catch up. We had been texting, and she‚Äôd mentioned that she was worried about Maya, but I assumed it was just typical gossip. However, when we started talking about it, Lena told me that Maya had told her she was thinking about moving in with Jake. And that‚Äôs when my stomach dropped. I don‚Äôt know what it was about the timing or the way Lena said it, but something clicked. I realized how much I had ignored ‚Äî how much I had been letting slide because I didn‚Äôt want to step on anyone‚Äôs toes.

I finally decided to speak to Maya about my concerns, but I waited way too long. I should‚Äôve spoken up months ago when I first felt that unease. But I didn‚Äôt, and now I wasn‚Äôt sure how to approach it.

A few days later, I called Maya. We were sitting in a coffee shop, and I just blurted out that I was worried about her. I told her I‚Äôd been noticing how possessive Jake had been, how she was pulling away from the people who loved her, and that I didn‚Äôt think he was the right guy for her. I didn‚Äôt accuse him of anything malicious ‚Äî I just expressed how her behavior had changed, and how I felt like she was losing herself.

She got really defensive, and honestly, I wasn‚Äôt surprised. She started crying, saying that I didn‚Äôt understand her relationship and that I was just trying to control her. She said that Jake made her happy, and that I was being judgmental, not supportive. It hurt, but I tried to stay calm. I told her I would always be there for her, no matter what, but that I couldn‚Äôt stand by and watch her get hurt.

We didn‚Äôt speak for a few weeks after that.

Here‚Äôs the thing ‚Äî the next few months were rough. Maya‚Äôs relationship with Jake escalated quickly. She moved in with him, and soon after, she started cutting off other friends and family. Every time I reached out, she either ignored my calls or gave me short responses. I tried to be patient, I really did, but watching her slip away was agonizing.

Then, everything came crashing down when we all found out that Jake had been emotionally abusive. It came to light that he had been isolating her from all of us, subtly manipulating her into thinking no one cared about her or supported her. He was controlling and gaslighting her, and Maya was starting to lose herself in the process.

I was heartbroken. I couldn‚Äôt believe that I had been so blind, so unwilling to speak up sooner. I‚Äôd seen the red flags, I‚Äôd ignored the gut feeling telling me something was wrong, and now Maya was stuck in this toxic relationship. I should‚Äôve said something sooner, I should‚Äôve fought harder to protect her from that. But I didn‚Äôt, and now she was paying the price.

Eventually, Maya did reach out to me. She apologized for pushing me away and said she had finally started to see what everyone was trying to tell her. She had left Jake, but it was a long, painful process. The emotional scars were deep, and she didn‚Äôt know how to rebuild her life. I was relieved to hear from her, but also so sad for what she had gone through.

It‚Äôs been a year since all of this, and Maya is still healing. We‚Äôve slowly rebuilt our friendship, but I will never forget how I ignored my instincts, how I let fear of causing conflict keep me from speaking up sooner. I‚Äôve learned that sometimes, being a good friend means saying the hard things, even if it means risking a fight or damaging the relationship temporarily. If I had trusted myself and spoken out earlier, maybe Maya wouldn‚Äôt have had to go through all that pain.

So, yeah‚Ä¶ my gut was right all along. And I‚Äôm still trying to forgive myself for not listening to it sooner.

Thanks for reading, if you made it this far. I‚Äôm sharing this as a reminder to always trust your instincts and to never be afraid to speak up when something doesn‚Äôt feel right. And if you‚Äôre in a situation like this, don‚Äôt wait until it‚Äôs too late. You could save someone you love a lot of heartache.

TL;DR 
I ignored my gut feeling about my best friend‚Äôs boyfriend and didn‚Äôt speak up soon enough when I noticed red flags. He turned out to be emotionally abusive, and I wish I had trusted myself and intervened earlier. Always trust your instincts when it comes to the people you care about.",2,1741808695.0,tifu,2,0.57,False

1j9sn98,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j9sn98,Welcome home little one.,"So, I got this machine with a grinder for ‚Ç¨250 secondhand. It‚Äôs my first espresso machine.

The test shot at the seller‚Äôs place was actually quite nice and tasty.

When I brought it home, I gave it a basic clean and noticed that the shower screen splashes more than it drips evenly. I also saw small bits of gunk coming out of the group head.

I tried cleaning it with espresso machine cleaner and a blind filter, but not much came out of the backflush tube. When I ran the pump for 5‚Äì10 seconds, it only produced a small spit of water.

Then I ran one full tank of descaler through the machine, followed by four tanks of clean water to flush it out. It looked like a lot of residue came out‚Äîsmall particles, obviously coffee, and some white bits.

Right now, I‚Äôm struggling with either a water flow/pressure issue or my grind setting. The puck is sludgy and has a small puddle of water on top.

You got ideas, recommendations, improvements, mod recommendations? 
Also do you know the size or where I can get the seal for the group head? (The original one ist thinner and wider newer one doesn‚Äôt fit, it‚Äôs too thick) ",2,1741807920.0,gaggiaclassic,0,1.0,False

one of my closest female friends is getting married this year too. super happy for her, but man, it just makes me feel even lonelier. i have my family, and i love spending time with them, but there‚Äôs still this weird emptiness i cant shake off.

We're making our way through the Avetts' 2024 self-titled LP The Avett Brothers with a poll every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.

The rules are simple: vote for whichever song you think should be **eliminated** and the last song standing wins.

\-----

***The Avett Brothers (2024)***

1. ~~Never Apart (w/ Vocal Prelude)~~
2. Love Of A Girl
3. Cheap Coffee
4. ~~Forever Now~~
5. ~~Country Kid~~
6. ~~Orion's Belt~~
7. 2020 Regret
8. ~~Same Broken Bones~~
9. We Are Loved

\-----

In the fifth round ""Never Apart"" and its vocal prelude were eliminated with 28% of the vote. It tied with ""Love of a Girl"" but was eliminated because in the previous 4 rounds it received far more votes than LOAG ever has. (In fact, it's almost always been the second-most vote receiver.)

The Avetts sure as heckfire know how to open an album. (They also know how to close an album, but I'll save that for my future ode to ""We Are Loved"".)  ""Pretty Girl From Matthews""? Banger.  ""Swept Away""? ""The Once and Future Carpenter"", ""Open Ended Life"" Bona fide hook-line-and-sinkers. You know exactly what kind of album you're gonna hear as soon as those songs start. 

And perhaps more than any previous album, ""Never Apart"" is the thematic, sonic, emotional, and spiritual thesis for the album.  It's a rich continuation of their earlier songs ""Life"" and ""No Hard Feelings"", but prefaced with a simple Sunday morning hymn and injected with a breezy confidence that isn't as heavy as the aforementioned back catalogue. ""Death is not an issue, it cannot break my heart"" sums it up best.

I think the arrangement and production of this track is outstanding. The production is not preoccupied with ""what sounds can we use to make this new"" but rather ""how can we keep all these gentle elements distinct and special."" It's gentle but incredibly powerful.

Recently I‚Äôve been on a huge horror kick and have been watching old and new movies and reading horror books, manga, and comics. Currently reading The Ritual. Video games, I‚Äôm really into jrpgs and rpgs. Some favorites are Dark Souls and Elden Ring (not a fan of Sekiro). BG3, Zelda series, SMT, Persona, Monster Hunter World and Rise.

Sometimes thinking about everything to eat in a week just plain sucks. So here's a meal plan, prep instructions, price estimates etc.

‚îÄ‚îÄ .‚ú¶ Price will vary based on location, dietary needs/wants/restrictions and family size. All of my pricing is based on the walmart app. *PLEASE check your food pantry's first and shop from your own pantry before spending money.*  You may have some of these things already on hand.

‚îÄ‚îÄ .‚ú¶ I cook for 1-2 people typically, my plan reflects that.  If you're only cooking for 1-2 people there should be plenty to go around with extras to freeze probably. My goal was to stay under $80. It can be much less if you have some of these items already.

‚îÄ‚îÄ .‚ú¶ A *good* chunk of prep is involved in this. It will make your week arguably much easier. It's recommended to have some containers and freezer bags / cling wrap / whatever you got to put things in. I use some from the dollar store. I left out eggs because the prices have been all over the place.

**Meal Plan Overview:**

Focused on a mix of feel-good foods that often feel out of reach and your average ""poverty meals"" so to speak. Fruit, veggies, and caffeine all included to keep your body fueled.  All lunches were made with the idea of taking them to work in mind. 100ct one daily multivitamin included. Breakfast is probably my least favorite of all of the meals here.  Make sure you read the instructions and note down anything unclear.

**Complete Meal List :**

‚ô° Breakfast:  
‚îÄ‚îÄ . ‚ô° Muffin or toast  with drink of choice  + a clementine  
‚îÄ‚îÄ . ‚ô°  Cereal with drink of choice + a clementine  
‚ô° Lunches:  
‚îÄ‚îÄ . ‚ô° Kind of Kimbap !  
‚îÄ‚îÄ . ‚ô° PB&J protein box !

‚ô° Dinners:  
‚îÄ‚îÄ . ‚ô° Baked chicken thigh with potatoes n' mixed veggies  
‚îÄ‚îÄ . ‚ô° Hot dogs, mac n cheese, veggies  
‚îÄ‚îÄ . ‚ô° Chicken, gravy, mashed potatoes and veggie  
‚îÄ‚îÄ . ‚ô° Japanese curry  
‚îÄ‚îÄ . ‚ô° Frozen pizza  
‚îÄ‚îÄ . ‚ô° Leftovers !

**Total Before Optional Add Ons : $73.17**

The last three items are completely optional. I thought it would be a good way to fit a snack and some extras in if you feel up to it.  This means for 1-2 people, 3 meals per day + a vitamin you'll spend $3.48 per meal (before add ons and caffeine)! If you don't want something, you can just take it off the list. E.g. if you don't want cereal, just don't buy it. („ÖÖ¬¥ Àò \`)

**Prep Instructions**

‚ü° Rinse your rice, I'd say about 3 cups or so should be plenty for the kimbap. Place it in a rice cooker or on the stove to start steaming.

‚ü° Make your muffins! follow the instructions on the box and toss em in the oven. They're not going to be very big or filling. Set a timer.

‚ü° While your muffins are baking, take out a cutting board and a couple containers. You're not focused on prepping every single meal here, primarily the ingredients.  
.....‚ü° Slice strawberries in half and place them in a container  
.....‚ü° Rinse green onion bunch and separate into two groups. One is for kimbap and the other for topping. For the kimbap group simply slice near the bottom (at the white part) and place that end to the side. For topping just chop the green onion normally.

**‚Çç‚ëÖ·ê¢..·ê¢‚Çé** *PRO TIP: Re-grow your green onions. A little dirt in an old past jar and put it in a window sill, or just water works. Place em roots down. I always have green onions on hand now.*

Choose if you want to go ahead and peel all the clementines and put em in a big container for the fridge now. That's up to you. I'd personally do so because it makes me more likely to eat it.

‚ü° Take your muffins out to cool and check the time on your rice. Let both sit while you start on the next steps.

‚ü° Get your big set of chicken out and begin deboning about half of it. It doesn't take long once you get the hang of it and will save you about $1 per pound. Keep a freezer bag handy to toss the bones and skin in for a stock eventually.

The deboned chicken should be cut up into pieces. half for chicken quesadillas, half for curry. . Label each.  If you think you have too much, just put some in a bag for later use.  
Grab freezer bags and separate the bone in chicken into them. Label one for chicken bake, the other for  chicken n gravy. It should be noted you can also debone some for the chicken n gravy, it's just up to preference.  
‚ü° Wash your hands and clean your area.  Proceed to wash your potatoes and chop them to desired size. Keep in mind that a portion of them will be used for a baked chicken n seasoned potato dinner.

‚ü° Grab the luncheon meat and slice it into ""batonnet"" cuts. I call em sticks.

**BAG LIST:**

**Curry Bag :**  Chopped potatoes, chicken, chopped onion  
**Bone Bag :**  All the scraps for a later bone stock eventually  
**Chicken n gravy bag :** just the chicken, add in onions if you wanna  
**Chicken bake :** the bone in chicken, season to taste!  
**Quesadilla bowl / bag**: toss in the deboned, cut up chicken and fajita seasoning

Congrats you're done with the chopping ! Now time for the home stretch.

Tidy up your work space and clean a little. You're going to be working on two things at once, so gather all that energy up. You need two pans, a bowl, a clean workspace and your lunch containers ready. If you don't have a bento / sectioned lunch box you can use cupcake liners to help separate

**KIMBAP PREP**

\- steam spinach in the microwave  
\- place spam in a medium heat pan. stir or flip occasionally, then lower the heat and pour in some teriyaki sauce. I like to let it char a little and coat the entirety of the spam.  
\- lay a piece of seaweed down, spread rice all over it. Then add shredded carrots, green onion, spinach, and your teriyaki spam. Roll it up. Repeat until you run out of rice/spam and then marvel at the insane amount of kimbap there is. Your arms are gonna look great with all the rolling. Slice one  or two up into ""sushi shapes"" . Wrap the other kimbap up very well and place into a container or freezer bag. You can take them out to thaw whenever you want now.  
\- place kimbap slices in lunch container next to some fresh fruit of choice and a dipping sauce if wanted.

**QUESADILLA PREP**

**-** place your fajita seasoned chicken in a pan to cook, medium heat, with a little bit of butter, toss / flip and allow it to get some pretty color. Place it to the side.  
\- in the same pan, lower the heat to a low medium and place a tortilla, some chicken and shredded cheese, and then another small tortilla on top. Flip.  
\- set all the quesadillas on the side, you don't have to make many all at once. You can save ingredients for later.  
\- place in a lunch container next to some fruit, optional toppings.

That is the majority of prep. If you want to take it to the next level, mix your desired amount of PB and J in a bowl, make a bunch of PBJ sandwiches and wrap em, toss in the freezer. they'll thaw like uncrustables.

Alllrighty. Let's talk about making the actual dinners now.

DINNER 1: baked chicken with potatoes and veggies  
\- season your baked chicken to taste, i like lemon pepper and herbs. Use what you got. Place on an oven safe pan, set at 375  with rough chopped potatoes (i like em a little thicker) that have a little oil on them for 45 minutes.  
\- after 45 minutes check your chicken and potatoes, then toss your mixed veggies in the microwave for about 6 minutes.  
\- take the mixed veggies out and put a little margarine, salt, pepper, or whatever seasoning you want on them. Plate.

DINNER 2: hot dogs, mac n cheese, veggies.  
\- if you have leftover veggies from the previous night use that.  
\- line hot dogs on a baking sheet and preheat your oven. while you do that, get a pot with water and salt in it and bring to a boil  
\- place hot dogs in oven and boil your pasta  
\- put your veggies in the microwave  
\- strain pasta, add sauce in, take the hot dogs out of the oven  
\- make your hot dog, add mac n cheese and veggies on the side

DINNER 3: chicken, gravy, mashed potatoes and veggies  
\- if your chicken is deboned, make it on the stove. if it isn't, put it in the oven with the same instructions as yesterday (season to taste, 375 for 45 mins)  
\- set a timer for 20 minutes, when that timer goes off..  
\- place potatoes in a pot with stock or water, bring to a boil and allow to become fork tender. strain. begin to mash the potatoes and place in 3tbsp of margarine and add a splash of milk. mash until desired texture, season with salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder if available.  
\- follow packet instructions for gravy  
\- place a bag of veggies in the microwave and heat em up just like last time  
\- check your chicken and plate!

DINNER 4: JAPANESE CURRY (kinda)  
\- thaw your pre prepped bag of items you have first  
\- start your rice in the rice cooker  
\- once thawed, season items in the ""curry bag"" and then place into a pot on medium high heat witha  little oil or margarine.  
\- stir often, once they have some color and onions look more translucent you can turn the heat down  
\- pour in water to cover the veggies and chicken, then add in your curry cubes and bring to a boil  
\- stir occasionally and keep an eye on it  
\- lower heat so it thickens

serve over rice

DINNER 5: PIZZA  
\- follow instructions on box, make pizza

DINNER 6 + 7: LEFTOVERS  
\- check on everything you have and decide your dinner. got more chicken for a quesadilla? make it. got some kimbap left? heat it up! PBJ for dinner and eat all the leftover fruits!

Alright guys this was a long ass post and honestly took a hot minute to put together this morning. Regardless I hope you like it. I'm a bit exhausted so some of this may not make sense. Remember! use what you have first, then shop.  There's likely to be plenty of kimbap because sometimes you can make 10 of them with just those super cheap ingredients. It's so nutritious.

Hope this helps someone, i tried to fit in stuff a lot of people don't think about (like a vitamin)!  Enjoy.",4,1741806555.0,povertykitchen,0,1.0,False

Hundreds of random men have been recorded without consent and posted on TikTok on a recent trend shaming men for for going to cafes. Usually it is with the captions or titles such as ""Men used to go to war and now they drink at cafes"" or something like that. They will all call the men feminine or imply that the men are gay for even standing up for themselves. They comments constantly belittle men as well. And the men aren't even doing anything wrong. The men are just sitting there with an all male friend group(s), and chilling or studying while drinking coffee together. This is a very common practice among male students around the world, even today.

The women in the comments are saying that ""it's a feminine thing to do"", or ""don't they have a war to die at?"" and numerous other extremely sexist and misandrist comments under the videos. Once they are getting replied back with ""why don't you stop going to the gym?"", or ""why don't you stop majoring in STEM?"" they start having an absolute mental breakdown and all of them come attacking the person replying. Some of them are replying with ""Those are taking care of your health/ gaining knowledge"", ""it's not masculine to take care of your health or to study"" or something along those lines.

This trend and their comments, replies actually only pushed the stereotype of women not being logical and not having adequate knowledge of history. Here's a little brief history of them (had helped from gpt to summarize the events accurately):

1. **1400s‚Äì1600s** *The* ***first*** *coffeehouses emerged in the Islamic world, particularly in the Ottoman Empire (modern-day Turkey) and Persia (Iran).* ***Almost exclusively men. Women were typically excluded from public coffeehouses due to social norms.***
2. **1600s‚Äì1700s** ‚Äì Coffeehouses spread to Europe, becoming hubs for intellectuals, businessmen, and revolutionaries, with **men dominating** the spaces except in some French caf√©s.
3. **1700s‚Äì1800s** ‚Äì The bourgeoisie, writers, and political thinkers made caf√©s central to revolutions in France and America, while women gained limited access in elite Parisian settings.
4. **1800s‚ÄìEarly 1900s** ‚Äì Urbanization brought workers, artists, and intellectuals to caf√©s, with Parisian caf√©s becoming artistic hubs and colonial coffeehouses appearing in India and North Africa.
5. **Mid-1900s‚ÄìPresent** ‚Äì Caf√©s became fully gender-inclusive, expanded globally, and now cater to all social classes, from casual coffee drinkers to professionals and remote workers.

So, not only did they not do an ounce of research, but are completely unaware of some basic historical concepts of the places they claim to be theirs only.

I thought the fact that men of higher social classes or philosopher, poets etc. loved these places would be common knowledge even to femcels. I noticed how they claim that men make it difficult for them to enter male dominated spaces and at the same time the same women will claim those spaces that are quite literally objectively masculine to not be masculine at all or not male dominated at all, when it becomes an issue since they made an issue out of men going to cafes.

It was utterly disgusting to see literal female lawyers making such jokes without any consequences to their career. It was funny to see so many women self reporting as half-brained, hypocrites when they didn't like their logic being applied to them.

My question to these women recording and shaming young men who are trying to study, chill with friends, or just there for a cup of coffee, how would you like it if we men came together and started recording random women and shaming them for studying STEM, going to the gym, driving, or doing anything that is traditionally perceived as masculine?

History repeats itself in one way or another, and if we do not come together to shame these women for recording random men and shaming them on TikTok for going to the cafe, it is bound to happen again in another form. This is very similar to women recording random men just for going to the gym and labeling them as creeps (not saying their aren't any) just for working out and minding their own business and then posting it online to shame them publicly.

A little TikTok search should bring up a lot of videos of this trend.",1,1741806486.0,thestoicden,0,1.0,False
1j9s21s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Yellowjackets/comments/1j9s21s/does_anybody_else_like_the_adult_timeline/,Does anybody else like the adult timeline?,"I get that the tone might not be to everyone's taste, and people prefer the younger timeline with its 70% darkness to 30% comedy and adult is the inverse, but there's got to be others who also like the adult timeline a lot? I'm happy every week to cut to Jeff doing bingo standup whilst shauna gets locked in a fridge and falsely blames it on Misty, whilst Van has to awkwardly sit next to Tai's actual wife on a park bench. I get that it's a lot more meandering than the past timeline but I do actually really enjoy that and a lot of skill goes into making scenes that are that funny and still with compelling characters. 

I'm regularly laughing out loud at the adults and their shenanigans, and this show has always been extreme/wacky in both horror and comedy. I mean season 1 had plenty of stuff like 'there's no book club', Misty snorting Nat's cocaine, arriving too early for the blackmailer and having to sit in the minivan like mums waiting for their kids. To me the point of the adult timeline being so comedic is to show how absurd these humans are if you put them in a normal setting. Like when they were chill about murder in the wilderness or having a morning conversation with Misty Fucking Quigley it seems quite normal and grounded. Often it even feels scary or ominous about where their behaviour might go. Lottie running a cult in the woods feels powerful and real, but in the warm light of civilised 2021 it feels kind of corny and funny to go along with. Which reflects how their adult selves see the concept of the wilderness. 

The point of the adult timeline to me has always been to see how absurd it is to take those humans from the woods and put them in a coffee shop trying to be normal. They're pathologically incapable of that and it's FUNNY. Shauna can't just go get her brakes checked out, she's got to interrogate the random man about who tampered with them and have Jeff start spiralling about karma. Misty can't just go get drunk at a bar after killing her bestie, she has to try recreate her time with nat threatening to set dicks on fire etc. This season,  shauna going on a paranoia witch hunt is terrifying in 1996 when you're trapped with her knife and her power in this society , but in 2021 when she's coming to your care home to make tapioca and threaten you for cutting her brakes, well it seems quite funny.  Idk I just think that half the show gets so much flack for how much I enjoy watching it scene to scene, even if in an overarching sense it's less successful than 1996 and obviously people can critique. I just want to know if anyone else properly enjoys it? 

Anyway, I predict that as the adults become more like their teen selves that the comedy will decrease a bit because they will no longer feel their 'normal' selves pushing up against their wilderness selves and therefore they won't feel absurd doing stuff like the hunt at the end of season 2. As the adults get darker so will the tone of their storyline, especially now that the stakes are going up and up and they're all awakened to the wilderness and their past selves.

1j9s16g,https://i.redd.it/qy48m2cr4boe1.jpeg,Brave words,"Holly Butcher posted her advice to the world, 24 hours before she died of cancer. This was her message...

A bit of life advice from Hol:

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a strange thing to realise and accept your mortality at 26 years young. It‚Äôs just one of those things you ignore. The days tick by and you just expect they will keep on coming; Until the unexpected happens. I always imagined myself growing old, wrinkled and grey- most likely caused by the beautiful family (lots of kiddies) I planned on building with the love of my life. I want that so bad it hurts.

That‚Äôs the thing about life; It is fragile, precious and unpredictable and each day is a gift, not a given right.

I‚Äôm 27 now. I don‚Äôt want to go. I love my life. I am happy.. I owe that to my loved ones. But the control is out of my hands.

I haven‚Äôt started this ‚Äònote before I die‚Äô so that death is feared ‚Äì I like the fact that we are mostly ignorant to it‚Äôs inevitability.. Except when I want to talk about it and it is treated like a ‚Äòtaboo‚Äô topic that will never happen to any of us.. That‚Äôs been a bit tough. I just want people to stop worrying so much about the small, meaningless stresses in life and try to remember that we all have the same fate after it all so do what you can to make your time feel worthy and great, minus the bullshit.

I have dropped lots of my thoughts below as I have had a lot of time to ponder life these last few months. Of course it‚Äôs the middle of the night when these random things pop in my head most!

1) Those times you are whinging about ridiculous things (something I have noticed so much these past few months), just think about someone who is really facing a problem. Be grateful for your minor issue and get over it. It‚Äôs okay to acknowledge that something is annoying but try not to carry on about it and negatively effect other people‚Äôs days.

2) Once you do that, get out there and take a freaking big breath of that fresh Aussie air deep in your lungs, look at how blue the sky is and how green the trees are; It is so beautiful. Think how lucky you are to be able to do just that ‚Äì breathe.

3) You might have got caught in bad traffic today, or had a bad sleep because your beautiful babies kept you awake, or your hairdresser cut your hair too short. Your new fake nails might have got a chip, your boobs are too small, or you have cellulite on your arse and your belly is wobbling.

Let all that shit go.. I swear you will not be thinking of those things when it is your turn to go. It is all SO insignificant when you look at life as a whole. I‚Äôm watching my body waste away right before my eyes with nothing I can do about it and all I wish for now is that I could have just one more Birthday or Christmas with my family, or just one more day with my partner and dog. Just one more.

4) I hear people complaining about how terrible work is or about how hard it is to exercise ‚Äì Be grateful you are physically able to. Work and exercise may seem like such trivial things ‚Ä¶ until your body doesn‚Äôt allow you to do either of them.

I tried to live a healthy life, in fact, that was probably my major passion. Appreciate your good health and functioning body- even if it isn‚Äôt your ideal size. Look after it and embrace how amazing it is. Move it and nourish it with fresh food. Don‚Äôt obsess over it.

5) Remember there are more aspects to good health than the physical body.. work just as hard on finding your mental, emotional and spiritual happiness too. That way you might realise just how insignificant and unimportant having this stupidly portrayed perfect social media body really is.. While on this topic, delete any account that pops up on your news feeds that gives you any sense of feeling shit about yourself. Friend or not.. Be ruthless for your own well-being.

6) Be grateful for each day you don‚Äôt have pain and even the days where you are unwell with man flu, a sore back or a sprained ankle, accept it is shit but be thankful it isn‚Äôt life threatening and will go away.

7) Whinge less, people! .. And help each other more.

üòé Give, give, give. It is true that you gain more happiness doing things for others than doing them for yourself. I wish I did this more. Since I have been sick, I have met the most incredibly giving and kind people and been the receiver of the most thoughtful and loving words and support from my family, friends and strangers; More than I could I ever give in return. I will never forget this and will be forever grateful to all of these people.

9) It is a weird thing having money to spend at the end.. when you‚Äôre dying. It‚Äôs not a time you go out and buy material things that you usually would, like a new dress. It makes you think how silly it is that we think it is worth spending so much money on new clothes and ‚Äòthings‚Äô in our lives.

Buy your friend something kind instead of another dress, beauty product or jewellery for that next wedding. 1. No-one cares if you wear the same thing twice 2. It feels good. Take them out for a meal, or better yet, cook them a meal. Shout their coffee. Give/ buy them a plant, a massage or a candle and tell them you love them when you give it to them.

10) Value other people‚Äôs time. Don‚Äôt keep them waiting because you are shit at being on time. Get ready earlier if you are one of those people and appreciate that your friends want to share their time with you, not sit by themselves, waiting on a mate. You will gain respect too! Amen sister.

11) This year, our family agreed to do no presents and despite the tree looking rather sad and empty (I nearly cracked Christmas Eve!), it was so nice because people didn‚Äôt have the pressure of shopping and the effort went into writing a nice card for each other. Plus imagine my family trying to buy me a present knowing they would probably end up with it themselves.. strange! It might seem lame but those cards mean more to me than any impulse purchase could. Mind you, it was also easier to do in our house because we had no little kiddies there. Anyway, moral of the story- presents are not needed for a meaningful Christmas. Moving on.

12) Use your money on experiences.. Or at least don‚Äôt miss out on experiences because you spent all your money on material shit.

13) Put in the effort to do that day trip to the beach you keep putting off. Dip your feet in the water and dig your toes in the sand. Wet your face with salt water.

14) Get amongst nature.

15) Try just enjoying and being in moments rather than capturing them through the screen of your phone. Life isn‚Äôt meant to be lived through a screen nor is it about getting the perfect photo.. enjoy the bloody moment, people! Stop trying to capture it for everyone else.

Random rhetorical question. Are those several hours you spend doing your hair and make up each day or to go out for one night really worth it? I‚Äôve never understood this about females 

ü§î.

16) Get up early sometimes and listen to the birds while you watch the beautiful colours the sun makes as it rises.

17) Listen to music.. really listen. Music is therapy. Old is best.

18) Cuddle your dog. Far out, I will miss that.

19) Talk to your friends. Put down your phone. Are they doing okay?

20) Travel if it‚Äôs your desire, don‚Äôt if it‚Äôs not.

21) Work to live, don‚Äôt live to work.

Seriously, do what makes your heart feel happy.

22) Eat the cake. Zero guilt.

23) Say no to things you really don‚Äôt want to do.

24) Don‚Äôt feel pressured to do what other people might think is a fulfilling life.. you might want a mediocre life and that is so okay.

25) Tell your loved ones you love them every time you get the chance and love them with everything you have.

26) Also, remember if something is making you miserable, you do have the power to change it ‚Äì in work or love or whatever it may be. Have the guts to change. You don‚Äôt know how much time you‚Äôve got on this earth so don‚Äôt waste it being miserable. I know that is said all the time but it couldn‚Äôt be more true.

Anyway, that‚Äôs just this one young gals life advice. Take it or leave it, I don‚Äôt mind! 

Oh and one last thing, if you can, do a good deed for humanity (and myself) and start regularly donating blood. It will make you feel good with the added bonus of saving lives. I feel like it is something that is so overlooked considering every donation can save 3 lives! That is a massive impact each person can have and the process really is so simple. 

Blood donation (more bags than I could keep up with counting) helped keep me alive for an extra year - a year I will be forever grateful  that I got to spend it here on Earth with my family, friends and dog. A year I had some of the greatest times of my life.

..‚ÄôTil we meet again.

Fast forward to the relationship currently, and he is sometimes nice and sweet, but not in a romantic way, just in a good mood at the moment, or just excited because we have plans with friends. He honestly gives my dog more love and attention than me. Which doesn't bother me, but I've taken notice to it. When I get home from work, he never greets me excitedly, gives me a hug or a kiss hello, it's basically a cold shoulder, unless of course I have the dog with me, which he immediately riles up and runs off with. In general he doesn't ever show me any affection unless we are going to bed and he wants sex. Which honestly I couldn't care less to do it anymore. If I go up to him to give him a hug, he keeps his hands at his side and doesn't embrace me back. He acts as if a random person is hugging him. When I bring these concerns and other issues up to him, he goes silent, doesn't reply to anything I say, and lets me go on and on. It's like I'm not even worthy enough to get a reply or even acknowledgment back from him.

Yesterday would have been my dads 50th birthday, and to celebrate it we went out to dinner with my family. I didn't even tell him why we were going to dinner, I just told him when and where we were going. When we were leaving dinner he asked me why I didn't tell him it was for my dad, and then goes on to criticize my grandma for crying while we toasted to my dad with wine. ""Why was she crying, she's so dramatic"". As he is saying this I have tears in my eyes, I kept getting teary eyed the whole day and would just try to distract myself so I wouldn't ball crying. It's just emotional having to celebrate a parents birthday without them. He never once hugged me or gave me condolences. I mean it would've just been nice, just for him to acknowledge it. I don't know if I'm being dramatic or not. I mean it's not a big ask to be empathetic to your girlfriend. Should this be like a final straw for me, I don't know, I'm just sick of not getting any affection.",0,1741805932.0,dating_advice,11,0.5,False

It was a great deal of banter back and forth, and she would send me videos and pictures of herself and the scenery as she was on holiday in Asia and I was doing the same as I went on holiday too. Every two days we would text each other and rather flirtatious. 

On her dating profile she indicated she was looking for ""fun casual dates / long term relationship"".

When we both returned from holiday we set up a date. It was just before Ramadan which began on a Sunday, So, in light of this, I asked her if she wanted to meet on a Thursday and Friday. We met on both days, which culminated in dinner, coffee and even going to the spa by booking a private spa room (which she was open to as well). While we were there, we vibed and got sexual but no penetration. Afterwards we had dinner and then went to the arcades. Generally we vibed well and had a similar outlook on some topics and she told me how different I was in real life as compared to online from a positive standpoint. We do differ though in the sense that she was in a long term relationship with another man for 7 years but had an ""open relationship"" where she slept with 5 other men during that time. Nonetheless, I was respectful of this and I did not judge her at all. In terms of her character, she describes herself as ""introverted extrovert"" and is able to spend time alone quite comfortably and does not enjoy a strong relationship to her parents and was rebellious in her teen years as she did not fit the profile of how her parents were hoping she would turn out to be (although I must say she is educated and smart).

On our first date, I told her that soon Ramadan would begin and I would be very busy for the next 4 weeks with fasting and that I usually do not go out in the evenings as I am breaking my fast and spending time with family. She was very understanding of this and appreciated me telling her this in advance. I told her we can still keep the contact and even break a fast together at some stage and she was open to that. So, after our second date, I dropped her off home and gave each other a kiss and that was it for the night.

One week passes by and then I send her a text asking her how she is doing and share a picture of the dinner table at my familys home to show her how we break the fast, like a part of my culture. I see one tick on Telegram, which means it is is delivered but she has not opened the message. Its been 4 days. Normally she would be much more responsive.

Now, despite the fact that during my initial conversations with her I told her I am the kind who always respected open and honest communication and that being disinterested is okay as long as it is communicated respectfully, I genuinely felt she understood that. This makes me the all the more surprised at her behaviour. In fact, as we got to know each other on our first date, I explicitly told her that I I am not a fan of ghosting or blocking someone but always appreciated transparent communication. She even told me at one point how she is the type who does not like having arguments with people but will communicate in some way when she no longer wants to meet someone.

I will not double text and do anymore chasing but my text to her was just to keep some momentum and the conversation going while I also focus on the month of fasting. I understand that fun casual dates are just that, but would a woman not have a bit more empathy towards a man who made a real genuine effort over two dates (it was really well thought out in terms of the dinner place and the wellness box was expensive).

TL; DR: had two good dates with a woman who suddenly ghosted me.",1,1741805456.0,relationships,1,1.0,False

|OUTSIDE AMBIANCE/CHICKEN NOISES|

Woah there's enough for all of ya'll. Don't go being rude to each other. We do this every day, and ya‚Äôll get the same thing.

\[JOKING\] Feather you better leave Nugget alone or I'll be makin' a Sunday dinner out of you.

\[CALM\] (sigh) Alrighty, that should be it for the chickens... I need to go check the garden and I can finally go inside and relax.

I hope there are some things I can harvest today. That'll be nice and I can share it with Berry. He‚Äôll be happy to slobber up anything‚Ä¶ that little silly baby. Hmm, What should I even make? I know there are still some-

\[SFX: LOUD CAR CRASH/THUD\]

What on great earth was that? (sigh) Best go check. I don‚Äôt need anything happening ‚Äòround my house or animals.

\[SFX: FAST WALKING UNTIL NEXT SFX\]

\[CALM YELLING\] My gosh...what is the world? Hey is anyone there? Are you okay?

PAUSE

\[QUIET\] Nothing... Don‚Äôt tell me‚Ä¶ \[LOUD\] Hey! Anyone there? Are you hurt? That car-

...

(Relieved sigh) I heard you! Are you okay? Can you- wait no wait for me.

\[SFX: CAR DOOR OPEN\]

Alrighty, Can you move?

...

Yeah, it's fine. Just breathe it's okay. You didn't hit any wildlife but it looks like you did run over something... I can't tell what it is right now but your tires took a bit of damage just from looking at em'. They're leakin' air fast it seems‚Ä¶ almost flat. Let's get you out of the car, I don't think it's best for you to stay in here. (Laugh) 'specially with them coyotes 'round here. They're pretty vicious... (tsk) Always tryin' to get at my chickens.

...

\[SOFT\] Don't worry I got you. You can take a second if you need to. There‚Äôs no rush.

...

That's it just breathe. Deep breaths. Let‚Äôs get that heart beat of yours steady,

...

I know it was scary but it's over and I'm here with you. I ain‚Äôt goin‚Äô let anythin‚Äô happen to you. Here, give me your hands.

‚Ä¶

You can let go of the wheel. It‚Äôs in park, it ain‚Äôt goin‚Äô anywhere.

‚Ä¶

Alright, I'm gonna give ya' a little squeeze.

...

\[SOFT\] Does this help a little? Mm-mm, don't look at the road, look at me.

...

Yup, right here. Hi darlin', you are alright and will continue to be alright.

...

Let me get a look at ya... mmm I don't see any marks on ya but we should check later after you get settled. Are you ready?

...

(Laugh) To get out of the car and onto a much more comfy couch.

...

Mine, Darlin'. I'm the only house here for miles and unfortunately, no tow truck is coming today or most likely the whole week. They're on strike right now. Something about the boss takin‚Äô too much out of their pay. Dirty no good bastard. Havin' good folk work for him but won't pay them their worth.

...

\[TRAILING OFF\] I will figure something out to get your car fixed... not much needing fixin' tho. Just the tires. I wish I had my truck but I let a good friend of mine borrow it to move his things to his new house. If I had it I would've driven you into town to get new tires... or attached your car to it and brought it down with us. (sigh) Best not to dwell on it, there is nothing that can be done about it now. Alright, you ready to get goin‚Äô?

...

Yup, take your time. Your legs might not work with you if you're still a little jittery.

...

\[SOFT\] Ah, no you don't, I got ya. I won't let you fall Darlin'. You can put all your weight on me, I don't mind one bit.

...

(Laugh) Oh, no you're not. I wrestle with my cows on a daily. Now those hard-headed things are hefty. Plus they tend to think they're lap dogs‚Ä¶ ‚Äòspecially Berry. He‚Äôs somethin‚Äô else i swear. Compared to them you're basically a feather.

‚Ä¶

I would feel better if you did.

‚Ä¶

That settles it. Make sure you grab anythin‚Äô you need.

...

Your bag? I'll grab it for you and \[SFX: KEYS JINGLING\] your keys. We wouldn't want them to go missin‚Äô in case someone does come 'round. They‚Äôll be in your bag. Come on before it starts to get dark.

\[SFX: CAR DOOR SHUT FOLLOWED BY LOCK\]

Nobody gettin' in there.

\[SFX: WALKING UNTIL STATED OTHERWISE\]

It's just up this little hill.

...

Well, I just got done feedin‚Äô my chickens and was about to grab some things from my garden when I heard the ruckus. I had to come to check out the noise. I‚Äôm not the type of person to ignore somethin‚Äô like this. It also would‚Äôve been on my mind all day.

...

I'm glad I did or else you wouldn't have known what to do. Probably would've been wastin' time callin' and callin' that tow truck number. If they're on strike they should've turned the number off and save people some time.

‚Ä¶

Right through the fence.

\[SFX: FENCE CLOSE\]

...

Yeah, those are the chickens over there. Little annoying critters. (Laugh) 'specially Feather, she's the mean one. Always takin' what doesn't belong to her.

...

Oh don't let her cuteness fool you. That's exactly how she gets you to trust her and before you know it you're handin' her your full sandwich with all the fixins'.

\[SFX: DOOR OPEN AND CLOSE\]

And here we are. Home sweet home.

...

It's cute, isn't it? My mother helped decorate it. She told me I needed all the help I could get if I wanted a partner. No matter what I said she didn't listen and now the whole place is lookin' good and put together. I love her for that honestly because between you and me, I didn't know what I was going to do. (Laugh) I didn't even know where to start.

...

Just as I promised you can sit right there on the comfy couch.

\[SFX: FABRIC RUSTLE\]

\[SOFT\] Can I get you anything?

...

I'm sorry Darlin', I would love to but my hands are completely tied. I meant do you want somethin' to drink or eat?? I was thinkin' of makin' a stew for dinner but that won't be ready anytime soon so would you want somethin' to snack on for the time being? I just went to the market about two days ago, I'm bound to have anythin' you want.

...

Well, I got some biscuits I made and some lovely strawberry jam from one of the nice old ladies in town. Every time I come ‚Äòround she tryin‚Äô to give me her whole batch and for free at that. I‚ÄôlI tell you a secret, sometimes when she‚Äôs not lookin‚Äô I hide a few dollars in places she won‚Äôt notice till I leave. It doesn‚Äôt stop me from getting yelled at the next time I see her but it does delay it some. So I think it‚Äôs very worth it.

‚Ä¶

Oh, I also make a mean sandwich... one of the best if I do say so myself. I fill them with some much stuff- hmm, that's not much of a snack now that i think about it. (laugh)

...

Lovely. I'm sure you'll love them so I'll get you a few. Sadly I don't have any cream cheese to go with it or else I would offer you some too.

...

Coffee? I can do that for ya also. How do you like yours?

...

Alright, that sounds perfect, I'll make you some-

...

\[NERVOUS\] Ah, the bathroom is down the hall on the left. Please remember that, I don't want you gettin' lost in the house. It's not that big but there's a ton of places to get confused.

...

Mmm, nothin'. I'll start brewin' the coffee while you're gone. Oh before I forget!! If you need to charge your phone I can do that for you.

‚Ä¶

Yeah, I had a feeling it was still in the car. Alright well, If you need to call anyone there is a landline on the side table next to the couch.

\[SFX: WATER FAUCET ON\]

\[SFX: WALKING\]

|FADE OUT|

\[STERN\] What are you doing in here?

...

I don't like- think you should wander throughout the house without me assisting you. I... don't want you getting in trouble and I can't find you in time. Come on, let's go back to the living room.

\[SFX: DOOR SHUT\]

Try not to let your mind wander back to this room, Please. I don't mind sharing every inch of my house while we wait for your car to get fixed but I would appreciate it if you would respect my need for my room to be private.

...

Yes, I understand being curious but push that thought anyway, please.

...

(Clear throat) The coffee is ready. I also went ahead and warmed up the biscuits, there‚Äôs nothin‚Äô like a warm biscuit with chilled jam on top.

\[SFX: WALKING\]

They are right on the coffee table. You can go ahead and eat, I'll be back in a little bit.

...

Since you are a little more settled right now, it's best I go finish my chores for the day and maybe check on your car.

...

It's okay, I just got to take a look at the garden and harvest the things that might overrippen by tomorrow. I also don't think it's a good idea for you to go back to your car. It's already almost dark out and you don't know your way 'round. And no offense but it'll be quicker if I went without worrying about keeping you safe.

...

Eat up and before you know it I'll be back. If you want to watch something, the remote is right here, or if that's too much there's a radio on the table. I also have plenty of books if that heed more of your interest.

...

You're very welcome.

\[SFX: QUIET FOOTSTEPS\]

\[WHISPER\] What do you have there Darlin‚Äô?

‚Ä¶

Woah what‚Äôs the matter? Why are you-

‚Ä¶

(laugh) Don‚Äôt be gettin‚Äô scared now‚Ä¶ You came in here even after I told you not to.

‚Ä¶

I thought after tellin‚Äô you that you have full reign of the house except my room.¬† When i said I wanted- no need it to be private‚Ä¶ you would‚Äôve understood. I guess your curiosity is too strong to listen when someone is telling you something. You need to work on that.

‚Ä¶

You would be right, those are your pictures‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre lovely, aren‚Äôt they? You in complete unsuspecting bliss. Ooo wait you haven‚Äôt got to the best ones-

\[SFX: PAPER FLIPPING\]

‚Ä¶

These are incredibly special. You looked amazing Darlin‚Äô. So tired and yet determined.

‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm not gonna do anythin‚Äô to you. You see, I like to think of myself as very hospitable so I want to care for you. I will care for you even after you disrespected me.

‚Ä¶

You can‚Äôt go anywhere‚Ä¶ your car is not in the best shape remember?

‚Ä¶

Yeah, it was just the tires, but I don‚Äôt know. We also have a few bears that come along occasionally. They are pretty playful‚Ä¶bumping into things, tugging‚Ä¶, breaking things.

‚Ä¶

Keys? You don‚Äôt need those; honestly, they can‚Äôt do anythin‚Äô for you right now. You know‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs a cute little lake past my farm, I should take you there one day. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll love it.

\[SFX: DOOR SLAM\]

I guess I haven‚Äôt made myself clear. You aren‚Äôt going anywhere ever. This is your home now and you best get used to it.

‚Ä¶

What does that have to do with anythin‚Äô? They won‚Äôt call you.

‚Ä¶

Oh no that‚Äôs where you‚Äôre wrong Darlin‚Äô. You told them you‚Äôd be doin‚Äô some soul searching. And you‚Äôd be gone as long as it takes to find yourself. Off-grid, they like to call it‚Ä¶ a chance to be free of any sort of judgment. (Laugh) Goin‚Äô on a trip all alone out in the country is a big brave move ‚Äòspecially without tellin‚Äô anyone where you were goin‚Äô exactly. That wasn‚Äôt that smart.

‚Ä¶

Yeah yeah, I‚Äôm sure they are on their way here as we speak. You don‚Äôt even have your phone anymore. (Laugh)

‚Ä¶

Doesn‚Äôt matter now. Come on.

‚Ä¶

You were curious, right? Well, there are more secrets in this room.

‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm surprised you didn‚Äôt get to the closet yet.

\[SFX: DOOR OPEN\]

I know stairs in the closet isn‚Äôt a normal sight these days but it‚Äôs normal for me and now you. Go down.

‚Ä¶

(Laugh) You have no choice.

‚Ä¶

These are the consequences of being nosy‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt worry though, I plan on makin‚Äô and keepin‚Äô you happy, Darlin‚Äô.

My right hand man. My soul dog. My rock. You never asked for much in return but always gave 110% when I needed you most. Through tough times, through pandemics, through moves, through the loss of my father, you always brightened my day. You always gave me such comfort. 

I‚Äôll never forget our walks together. I knew this day would come eventually so I cherished every step we took, whether it was a sunny summer day or a 20 degree blizzard. 

You never got sick of me when I would check on you every 10 minutes when you just wanted to nap. You would wait patiently at the window whether I ran out for a quick coffee or had to run errands. You would welcome me as if I were gone for weeks. 

I‚Äôll never forget how time sensitive you were and how conscious you were of the time, to the exact minute you‚Äôd let me know when you were hungry for dinner. Whether it was jumping on my leg or bringing your bowl over to me, you made sure I knew it was time for food.

Although the last few months were hard, you fought as hard as you could so we could buy a little more time together. I‚Äôll never forget every moment we spent together and cannot wait for the day we‚Äôre able to go on walks together again.

I am looking for a Robot for my 50m\^2 (540 feet) apartment. I have a ""flat"" carpet and one higher carpet in the bathroom. I don¬¥t want to spend more than **250‚Ç¨**.

I do not know if I should take one with a Mop or better one with an automatic station. 

Basically I want it to run everyday while I am at work and I have no problem to empty it after I come home. I do not expect it to do an deep clean, but currently I am maybe vacuuming all 3-4 weeks and maybe mopping after four months or so.  

I understand that this type of mop will not clean extreme stains, but currently I just let coffee drops or shoe prints acummulate. And I hope that even with such a basic mop those stains will be gone after a week.

OR I could buy a robot without a mop, but with a station?

**What do you say, is an Robot with a fixed mop good enough or would you prefer the automation of a station?**

*Found so far:*

Roborock Q5 Pro (with Mop) would cost: 250‚Ç¨, but I would wait for 200‚Ç¨

Roborock Q5 Max+ (no Mop, + station), currently down to 250‚Ç¨

Eufy L60, basically the same setup and the mop costs 60‚Ç¨ less than the Q5, with the station it costs the same, but apparently worse than the Q5?

1j9rdbl,https://www.reddit.com/r/freemasonry/comments/1j9rdbl/thoughts_on_the_craft_an_open_letter/,"Thoughts on the Craft, an open letter","Brethren,

From time to time, I find myself in a contemplative state of mind, my thoughts wander from topic to topic. This morning while sitting at my desk, sipping coffee I found myself ruminating on the state of the Craft in the United States and I wanted to take some time and write those thoughts out. Then maybe we can sort through the tangle of these thoughts and find the kernel, the start of, a solution. Because there is little doubt in my mind that we all know where the Craft sits in the world, diminishing membership, less active engagement in the Lodge and the other issues we can all see when we look around ourselves, no matter what jurisdiction we find ourselves under. I doubt that any Brother really wants to hear what I have to say, people generally do not want to have genuine conversations when it comes to their short comings, or to be told that they are doing anything wrong at all for that matter. But that is only going to exacerbate the issues that are facing us as a fraternity. No easy conversation, or bull session is going to help us address the elephant in the room.

‚ÄúBehold how good and pleasant it is for Brothers to dwell together in unity.‚Äù The words which highlight the ideals of the first degree are heard repeatedly in lodges all around the country, but do we take the time to look around and see if we are living this wisdom? Cliques form among us, even if we do not intend for them to, people will gravitate and form their own circles, even within larger groups. Look, the next time you are sitting down to fellowship, is it always the same Brothers sitting at the same table? Talking about the same thing? The same stories you have heard a hundred times. How does your lodge handle guests? What about visitors, do they float around the peripherals, or do they find themselves pulled in? Be honest with yourselves. But let us go still deeper than that, during lodge while handling business are we working together to build a stronger temple? Or are we bickering between factions? Are we hearing what is said by all or are we writing someone off because you do not have faith to hear a Brother out? Let us go another step, in public do you acknowledge you Brothers as you see them? Are you promoting the Craft through your daily actions, are we shooing the world just how good and pleasant it is to be a brother? Are you doing public facing events at all?

‚ÄúIt is the Blessed ointment that ran down over the beard‚Äù, how often we quote the first line of Psalm 133, but do we keep reading? For this line tell us just how important that harmony together is. Ointment, holy oil, Brotherhood, and Harmony are as great to us as Brother Masons, as to be a holy oil and blessing for our mortal souls, as important even as God‚Äôs promise of everlasting life. Observing brotherhood is one thing, fostering it, actively contributing to it is another. We often tell new Brothers they will get from the Craft what they put into it. We put it on the new to figure out their path through a landscape that they have no way to know or understand. Without guidance the entry can be overwhelming, beyond what is your lodge offering them to do, do you provide inputs for them to get involved with in the first place? What is your lodge actively engaged in that will provide the Brothers with the engagement or focus they need to give them a reason to invest their time, there must be some value to the membership. Not that everything needs to have an altruistic call to service, taking one day a month and dedicating it as a day to be seen by the community participating in something social would be sufficient, at least as a start. Contact civic organizations around you, find one thing a month you can do in your community together. Work a soup kitchen, join your local Kawanis or Rotary club to promote their charitable works, as a fraternity doing good in our community does not mean we have to be the inventors of the deeds we do. Working with another lodge on their own charity for example, help Zion #1 build a ramp, join that other Lodge with distributing coats to needy students. Visit your local DeMolay chapter as they confer their rituals. These programs flourished years ago not just because of the number of members but because of the number of members who participated. We may not have the million members we once did, but statewide there are still 25,000 of us. Plenty to make a difference, provided we are willing to make a change.

Thus, he shewed me and behold the Lord stood atop a wall made by a plumb line; as we advance through the degrees the bible, a corner stone to our work, the plumb line is about conduct, reminding us to remain upright in our dealings. But again, as with Psalm1333 the verse continues. God asks Amos what he sees as he is presented with a plumb. God tells Amos that he has taken notice of the moral decay of Israel, that he will no longer ignore the sins of his people. But more importantly it is He, the Lord alone, who holds the plumb, he alone who holds the right for judgement. We stop too early in this passage, we hear mention of the plumb and see our lesson as complete, but again, the lesson is so important, God alone will judge us for our actions on Earth. So let us remember this, it is not our place to judge our Brethren, it is only for us to help them to walk up rightly if they stray or slouch then we correct them, we accept their flaws, we know after all, that we are only human. More importantly we ourselves that we are always not fully upright, if we are to take on the mantel of the Lord himself, and pass judgement on our Brothers are we not taking on work we have not the knowledge to pursue that judgment, furthermore, this judgement is not for us to apply to Brothers alone, but for all people. Especially those who are interested in joining our fraternity. Yes, there are certain judgments that we are required to make, is he a moral and upright man? Does he meet our requirements? These are very necessary but when we fall short, will the be a good fit for our lodge? We have become so wrapped up in driving up membership that we sometimes forget that each lodge does have a temperament, a personality, all its own, and not all people are going to fit well in that environment. But there is where we truly make the biggest mistake of them all, instead of being honest with the candidate and encourage him to visit a different lodge that may be more suited to him we push him through, ultimately setting him up for failure. He is not going to fit in, and he is not going to be an active participant in the lodge. He will become just another due paying member and never be seen again and in this we are failing to observe our own plumb, we are deceiving the candidate and that is wrong.

If a potential candidate asks what a lodge is doing, what they get out of membership, and you find yourself struggling to produce an answer, then maybe you need to reflect on what it is your lodge is doing. But also answer the question honestly ‚Äúright now the lodge is a bit slow‚Äù or something like that, sure, some might want to walk away but if you are in a position where you notice that you really do not have anything going on you do not really want the weight of people who aren‚Äôt willing to put in some work to make things happen. The guy who sticks around when he knows the truth and is still a game is an asset you want to cultivate. That is the type who wants a challenge and wants to build, nurture that Brother guide and most importantly support him. He is going to have a wild idea; you may think that they could never work but if you support and show up for him you might be surprised just what can be accomplished through you simply supporting him and showing up. Judge not his enthusiasm, do not belittle his fervor for the Craft, and above all do not fall back on the old standby ‚Äúwell it‚Äôs never been done.‚Äù

‚ÄúRemember now thy Creator in the days of your youth.‚Äù King Solomon admonishes us to remember God as we did when we were young, before age, illness, troubles of life, and so many other things jaded our outlook. There was a time in each of our lives where we looked upon the world us with a more forgiving eye, a brighter, and in some ways maybe, rose colored glasses. While that naive outlook may seem foolish, it is through the hopeful eyes of youth that many of us entered the Craft, we must ever strive to recapture the excitement of the Entered Apprentice. For that is what this book of wisdom is highlighting to us, the Master Mason Degree is about old age, fading from the world of the living, returning to the dust from which we came. And we must stand and realize that this fading is a gradual process not a quick one. The sky slowly darkens over us as we age. We may move slower, be less likely to accept something new, or change, we are less likely to embrace a young man‚Äôs energetic attempts to breathe life into what we have come to know and love. But we must always strive toward that goal, that desire, that flame, of the Entered Apprentice. Cultivate him because he will be what carries us on, that flame tempered by the judgement of the Fellow Craft, we will guide them with the wisdom of the Master Mason. But it should be just that, guidance, we must acknowledge that we should not be the focus of the lodge, but rather the lodge should be our focus, as we move through the seats of power, the offices of a lodge and in the end acknowledge we have done what we can for the craft directly, take a step back and allow the next generation to lead us forward. Thus, it has always been.

Not every person who knocks at our doors is going to be the one who saves us, but the one who struggles and rails at stagnation is the one we need most. Have you ever noticed or experienced scent blindness? It is a phenomenon that occurs often, a human can get so used to a smell that they no longer recognize it as unique. They cannot detect it anymore because it is just a part of the background. We tend not to see the stagnation in our lodges because that has become the norm. But if someone points it out, if they say, ‚Äúhey what‚Äôs that smell?‚Äù instead of acknowledging it for what it is we double down ‚Äúwhat smell?‚Äù This continues for longer than it should, eventually the new guy gets used to the smell too, or he gets so frustrated with it he stops caring. If someone smells stagnation, perhaps we listen? And realize that maybe we have become blind to it? Only if we admit that there is a problem can, we ever fix that problem.

What then in the end am I trying to say in all of this? Freemasonry has existed for as long as it has not because it never changed but rather because it changes constantly. It adapts to the world in which it finds itself. We must acknowledge the end of the Golden Era, accept that the Fraternity is shrinking. Further, that it is not likely to recover to where it was 50 years ago. We must cultivate the membership we do have. Be more inclusive and active in our own ways, the understanding that we will lose more than we gain. Yes, lodges will likely close, be merged with other lodges, and although that is sad, we know that a few good men working hard together can change the world, so long as they know their truth and acknowledge their limitations. Together by studying the mysteries and lessons of our craft we can find true meaning in its words.

Not toward him, truly I wasn‚Äôt angry at him. I felt anger toward our roles and mentality. That he knew he needed a shower and just went and took one. He didn‚Äôt have to think about where our daughter was or that she‚Äôd be fine, he didn‚Äôt have to ask me ‚Äúhey is it ok if I go take a shower?‚Äù like I do. He had a thought of what he wanted/needed and just did it.

It just hit me and made me really bummed out today. Like I want to just hand her to him and walk away for a minute, but I also equally don‚Äôt. I know that I could ask him anytime to do anything, but it‚Äôs also hard for me not to feel like I or our daughter are a burden by doing so. Does this make sense?

------------------------------------------------------

Homemade ice cream is a delightful treat, but it can sometimes end up icy, rather than rich and creamy. One way to improve your ice cream‚Äôs texture is to incorporate unexpected add-ins. Here are seven innovative ingredients that can help you achieve a smooth and delicious homemade ice cream experience.

### 1. Alcohol

Adding a splash of alcohol, such as vodka or rum, can help to reduce ice crystal formation. The alcohol doesn‚Äôt freeze, which means it helps to keep the ice cream soft and creamy. Just a tablespoon or two can go a long way, so don‚Äôt overdo it! This method is perfect for adult-friendly flavors like pi√±a colada or chocolate bourbon.

### 2. Cream Cheese

Cream cheese is not just for bagels! It adds a rich creaminess and a slight tang to your ice cream. Because of its fat content, it helps to create a smoother texture and reduces ice crystals effectively. Blend it well with your other ingredients for the best results, and consider flavors like strawberry or chocolate cheesecake.

### 3. Corn Syrup

Corn syrup is a super sweet solution that can help prevent icy texture. Unlike regular sugar, it doesn‚Äôt crystallize as much when frozen, leading to a creamier finished product. Substitute part of your sugar with corn syrup, and experiment with flavors like vanilla or caramel to elevate your homemade ice cream.

### 4. Sweetened Condensed Milk

Sweetened condensed milk is a secret weapon for creamy ice cream. Its thick, syrupy texture contributes to a lower freezing point, meaning fewer ice crystals form. Just mix it with your favorite flavors, such as chocolate, coffee, or fruits, and you‚Äôll find that you have a wonderfully creamy end product.

### 5. Instant Pudding Mix

For a surprising twist, try adding instant pudding mix into your ice cream base. The mix absorbs moisture and adds thickness, leading to a smoother texture. It‚Äôs also an easy way to infuse additional flavor. You could use vanilla pudding mix for a classic vanilla ice cream or chocolate pudding mix for a rich chocolate treat.

### 6. Avocado

Many enjoy the creamy texture of avocados, and they work wonders in ice cream, too. They are rich in fats that help keep the ice cream from freezing too hard. Blend ripe avocados with your choice of milk and a sweetener, then add flavors like lime for a refreshing twist. Avocado ice cream is nutritious and a unique addition to your dessert repertoire.

### 7. Nut Butters

Nut butters, like peanut, almond, or cashew butter, can add a delicious depth of flavor while keeping the texture smooth. The natural fats in nut butter help reduce ice crystals and create a creamy consistency. You can swirl it into your base or blend it directly for a consistently rich taste, perfect for a nutty ice cream experience.

By incorporating these unexpected add-ins, you can elevate your homemade ice cream from icy to incredibly creamy. Each ingredient offers its unique benefits, contributing to texture and flavor in different ways. So, the next time you whip up a batch of ice cream, consider experimenting with these ingredients. You may just discover your new favorite recipe!

Make the Perfect Ice Cream--&gt; https://www.ice-cream-101.com  
  
Remember, the key to perfect homemade ice cream is not only in the base but also in the details‚Äîthese add-ins can make all the difference. Don‚Äôt hesitate to mix and match flavors while keeping an eye on the ice cream texture. Enjoy your delicious, creamy creations!

Notable differences of RGZS: 
1. The room up top is 3 wide, instead of 2. This makes it a more useful area for things like coffee tables and prep work. 
2. The location of the doors is more conducive to utilizing the upper room for prep, serving, etc.
3. The 4 pass throughs are spaced out instead of bunched together. This allows for more table configurations than on Oxford 
4. The guest entrance is on the farthest end of the kitchen. This allows for faster seating of waiting guests, and better table configs IMO.

I'm a barista and do alot of immersion%percolation style brews, and my main Question is:

Do you get diminishing returns on extraction with such a low ratio of dose to water and/or does the TDS lessen or weaken?

I know with French press/immersion, as the water extracts coffee compounds, the total mix settles on the bottom and the water has a harder time extracting MORE because of how tightly packed the molecules are, and how the strength of the water to extract, gets diluted with coffee compounds. 

I see alot of research pointing to a 1:2 or 1:3 for brew, and then doing equal parts 1:1 or 1:2 afterwards.

The promise? A weight-loss boost by simply adding a packet of Java Burn to your daily coffee. Sounds too good to be true, right? In this Java Burn coffee review, I‚Äôm going to break down my personal experience, the science behind it, and whether or not it lives up to the hype.

# What is Java Burn Coffee?

Java Burn is a weight-loss supplement in powdered form, designed to be mixed with your morning coffee. It contains a blend of natural ingredients that are said to boost metabolism, improve fat burning, and enhance energy levels. You simply stir a packet of the powder into your coffee, and you're set for the day.

# How Does Java Burn Work?

The main idea behind Java Burn is that it boosts the effects of coffee. Coffee naturally contains caffeine, which can speed up metabolism, but Java Burn claims to take this effect to the next level by supporting fat burning and thermogenesis. So, essentially, it's like getting the benefits of coffee plus the added advantage of ingredients that support weight loss. Check out more [**customer reviews of Java Burn**](https://cutt.ly/4wUM2yu5) to see how it works for others.

# Ingredients in Java Burn Coffee

Java Burn contains several ingredients that are commonly associated with weight loss and energy boosting:

* **L-carnitine** ‚Äì Helps with fat metabolism
* **Chlorogenic acid** ‚Äì Known for its antioxidant properties
* **Green tea extract** ‚Äì Often used for its fat-burning potential
* **Chromium** ‚Äì Helps with blood sugar regulation

# My Personal Experience

I‚Äôve been using Java Burn for about a month now, and here's what I‚Äôve noticed:

1. **Energy Boost:** The first thing I noticed was an increase in my energy levels. I felt more awake and alert after my morning coffee, which is a big plus for me.
2. **Appetite Suppression:** I didn‚Äôt feel as hungry in between meals, which made it easier to stick to a healthier eating routine.
3. **Weight Loss Results:** While I didn‚Äôt see drastic changes, I did lose a couple of pounds without making significant changes to my diet or exercise routine.

Overall, I did feel like I had more energy and noticed some gradual weight loss, but the results were not as fast as I expected.

# Is Java Burn a Scam?

Many people ask, ""Is Java Burn a scam?"" From my experience and the ingredients list, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a scam, but it's important to keep your expectations realistic. Java Burn isn't a miracle weight-loss solution. It works best when combined with a healthy diet and exercise, so don‚Äôt expect to lose significant weight by just drinking coffee with Java Burn.

# Java Burn Coffee Co Reviews

Many Java Burn reviews mention how convenient it is to use. The packets are easy to carry around, and it‚Äôs simple to mix into your coffee. However, some users have complained about the taste, but I personally didn‚Äôt mind it. It‚Äôs almost flavorless once it‚Äôs mixed in.

# Does Java Burn Work With Decaf Coffee?

Yes, Java Burn can be used with decaf coffee! If you‚Äôre sensitive to caffeine but still want the benefits of Java Burn, just mix it with decaf, and you'll still get the metabolism-boosting effects.

# Pros of Java Burn:

* Convenient and easy to use
* Boosts energy and suppresses appetite
* Supports fat burning and weight loss when combined with a healthy lifestyle
* Can be used with decaf coffee

# Cons of Java Burn:

* Not a miracle solution‚Äîresults vary based on lifestyle
* Some complaints about taste (though I didn‚Äôt mind it)
* Might take a few weeks to notice significant results

# Final Thoughts: Is Java Burn Legit?

After using Java Burn for a while, I can confidently say that it‚Äôs not a scam. It‚Äôs a helpful supplement to your daily coffee that can support weight loss and boost energy when paired with a healthy routine. However, it‚Äôs not a miracle weight-loss product, so set your expectations accordingly.

If you're looking for an extra edge in your weight-loss journey, Java Burn could be worth trying. But, like any supplement, results vary, and it‚Äôs essential to combine it with a balanced diet and exercise for the best outcome.

I‚Äôm 6 weeks pp and have a beautiful baby boy. I‚Äôm so in love with him. However, I expected his father to be a lot more supportive and helpful during this time. He had two weeks off of work and did all the house stuff during that time, but didn‚Äôt help with the nights at all. We had to go to a bottle despite wanting to EBF (nurse) because baby hasn‚Äôt been extracting. I triple fed for 3+ weeks so I was getting up in the night to nurse, then pump while supplementing with a bottle. My boyfriend would sleep through it all. He has sleep apnea and ADHD and claimed he needed his sleep to be able to help out around the house and for some reason I thought that was justified? 

My mom (and my saving grace) came out for 2.5 weeks and helped with the night feedings and took my son from 3/4am until 7am every morning so I could sleep/pump. She also prioritized all of my needs and made me coffee, breakfast, cleaned, took care of the dog. She was amazing. My boyfriend however didn‚Äôt like her here and just kept asking when she was leaving and honestly was not very inviting or welcoming. He didn‚Äôt really try to get to know her and she‚Äôs not here very often at all. Meanwhile I‚Äôve spent so much time getting to know his family. It felt like he didn‚Äôt care about my needs at all and was just thinking about his own. 

Now he‚Äôs back at work full time and wakes up around 5:30, leaves at 6:30, comes home around 4. Then he immediately goes to poop/workout and gets done around 6 sometimes 6:30. Then he heats us up dinner and THEN he takes the baby from 7 or 7:30 until 10:30. He claims he can‚Äôt watch him longer than that or wake up in the night because he works and needs to be focused (he doesn‚Äôt have a dangerous job). He‚Äôs a great dad when he‚Äôs with our son, but it‚Äôs like 3 hours a day, if that. He wont even help overnight when he doesn‚Äôt work. He claims he needs to workout (and it‚Äôs good he works out) but feels like me and my son are always second priority to his needs. I also end up cleaning up his dishes from the night before in the morning. He does keep the house relatively clean and vacuumed/dusted and does other house stuff like trash, etc when he‚Äôs home. Also, I have my own income and we pay for our own stuff but split rent. I pay for most of baby‚Äôs needs. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm feeling so frustrated. I‚Äôve tried communicating my needs (and that I think I‚Äôm dealing with a bit of PPD) but it always turns into a fight and turns into him needing sleep and stuff for work. I haven‚Äôt slept more than 3 hours at once in 2 months (including last two weeks of pregnancy). I get maybe 5 total a night. 

To top things off, he cheated on me three months into our relationship, and told me about it eight months into our relationship, which is around the time I got pregnant. He told me he had one meet up with her (slept together) and that was it and then he never spoke to her again. I found out who it was and reached out to her one month after he told me he cheated and found out he had talked to her for eight months (our whole relationship at that point) but only met up with her once (she lived in a different state and he traveled there for work). I felt trapped in the relationship and like I kind of had to stay because I was pregnant. I left for a couple months but ultimately thought I could maybe work through it for our son. I don‚Äôt know if I can. I have tried so hard to forgive him but I don‚Äôt know if I ever really will feel true and deep love for him after such a betrayal. He is a good man, but I thought that before I found all of this out too. So I don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs all hard. I can tell he‚Äôs changed since then, but I will always wonder and idk if I can live like that forever. 

I also met him in a different state than where my family is. I was living here for a year and we met and started dating. My whole family lives 2000 miles away (and I‚Äôm very close with them). I don‚Äôt know anyone here besides his family and him. And I don‚Äôt think I could legally leave to be with my family if we broke up. 

Anyway, maybe I‚Äôm just looking for sympathy or something. I know everyone is going to say he sucks. He‚Äôs a good dad and a gentle man (as in gentle) and has a lot of scars from his own parents. Not an excuse but I have tried to see him deeper. I just don‚Äôt know what to do at this point or if I‚Äôm just being a little bit more crazy because of hormones. His family is wealthy and I‚Äôm sure they would hire the best family attorney and I‚Äôd be screwed. I just don‚Äôt want to lose custody of my son or have this turn into a giant mess. I wanted us to be a family and cant imagine doing this alone. But I feel like I already am. So I don‚Äôt know. ",1,1741803390.0,Mommit,4,1.0,False

I am 25 years old, I currently live and work at a hostel in TN and I am also a part time line cook at a local coffee shop. I really don‚Äôt mind my current jobs, I work with great folks and the hours are good and the pay is better than anything I have ever made but still it‚Äôs not a lot in this day and age and  I am incredibly broke and do not make enough money for really much of anything other than food, medicine, doctors appointments, gas, etc, just like the usual life stuff. In a sense, it‚Äôs been difficult to save money because most of my paychecks end up going towards all these life things. I‚Äôm frustrated because I have goals and I don‚Äôt wanna live in a hostel forever but I feel stuck. I never went to college and I don‚Äôt have certifications in anything. Sure I could go to college and put myself in tons of debt, or I could look more into technical schools or for something smaller like a certificate in a field, but my absolute biggest fear and a big reason why I haven‚Äôt done those things is because I do not want my entire life to be consumed by my job. I‚Äôm not saying that I don‚Äôt want to work at all, like I said I don‚Äôt mind my current situation and jobs. But if I ever wanna make more money I fear I will have to sell most all of my time. My time is mine, and to have lived a life where I gave so much of my time just to make money, I fear I will die with regret. I am young, I know. I also think that I know myself pretty well, and I know that if I have to work 5 days a week 9-5 or anything similar of the sorts I will be depressed and probably end up going back to a part time position somewhere. I don‚Äôt want my life to have to be about a job and money, I want to experience, I want to meet people, I want to make art and music, I want to travel. But you need money to travel. I am lost out here. Humans of the world, do you have any advice for a young gal just trying to make a life they actually enjoy living? 


Edit: there are things I am passionate about, not one big passion, I have a plethora of things I enjoy, but still. There is nothing in this world that I believe is worth giving all of my time and energy to‚Ä¶.sometimes I worry that I am the problem?? Ugh. I just don‚Äôt know.

And mostly to increase SKU(product) count, brands either copy existing products or import from China (I still don't understand how can they produce so cheap).I do not want to blindly increase my SKU count. I want innovation and uniqueness in all my products, due to which my speed reduces.There are some steps we have taken to Fastrack product development cycles1. Developing in smaller batches (we are now manufacturing batch of 250 pieces compared to 2000 that we were doing earlier)2. We are trying to reduce fixed costs by using laser cutting instead of investing in moulds.3. Using AI to design product prototypes and brainstormWe are successful in reducing our costs and increasing our speeds substantially. It took us 6 months to build first two products but 2-3 months for next 3.I still want to keep customers at the center chair. I want to have a closed community of parents (children age 3-14), child educators, child psychologists and our product development team. Parents can benefit by free consultations and discussions to help reduce screen time and overall brain development and we will know closely what their problems are and can make products accordingly.I as a new founder, am seeking support from people who have already built a community of early adopters and believers on how to best do this.Should we stick to WhatsApp or try Facebook group or Instagram broadcast. Newsletter, Discord or Slack looks unsuitable somehow.And how do I make people believe, I am not going to push sale along their throat.If anyone has any idea, I would love to talk.
