1gu5fbq,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1gu5fbq/grinder_recommendations_electric_hopper_not/,"Grinder Recommendations? Electric, Hopper, NOT single-dose, strong preference for timed/automation.","Hey folks, long time lurker here.  Tried to lay it out there as well as possible in the title, but I'm really interested in a new electric grinder. 

Tldr;

* Electric 

* Hopper

* Timed

* Common burr size

* Filter/pourover and french press

* Roughly $600-$1000usd budget. 

My use case is for virtually exclusively pourover and french press. I actually switch between these two pretty frequently, so that's worth consideration. 

Because of the multiple people in my home using the grinder, and the volume of coffee that we go through, I'm very much interested in something with a small hopper (200-300g), simple automation, etc. 

I have no interest in a single dose grinder, and despite there being many extremely high quality options in this range, this becomes very limiting in the modern grinding scene. I'm also not interested in all of the tubular shaped form factors out there, but that's mostly eliminated by avoiding single dose focused options.

Budget isn't a massive concern, but I'd like to keep it somewhere in the $600 to $1,000 USD range. 

It feels like the Eureka Mignon series is really my wheelhouse here but reviews seem pretty mixed. Especially the grind size dial, when I'm expecting to be going between filter and french press often The Mahlkonig x54 is an alternative, too, but seems to struggle in the filter range.

What am I overlooking? I'm moving up from an old baratza and would love some new perspectives, but 98% of the reviews I run across are for super purpose built single dose options and those just aren't for me.

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop.

If most of your week is mundane except for a few exciting days, then feel free to share the juiciest part of your week, whatever you want to share. Anyway, I can start I guess:

I'm 34 F. Not married. No children. I'm a cat-mom, lol. I wake up to my 4 kitties wanting breakfast at about 4AM (days off I get up anywhere between 4AM and 5:30AM because I'm stuck waking up early, lol). Then I make myself coffee and breakfast and maybe watching a little TV before work. Then I get dressed. Just before I leave for work I will make 6 containers of wet canned food for a small feral colony of cats that I feed as I head over to my job. I feed them every morning. It's a mom and her 4 kittens and a neutered male recently showed up, so 6 cats. I give them their food, I take a minute to pet them to get them used to human contact, then I leave. Then work takes me about 17 minutes to drive to.

I work as an animal shelter technician at, you guessed it, a cat rescue, lol. I'm sure at this point you think I'm a crazy cat lady, but my first job was with horses so. I just love animals.

ANYWAY, work is only part time right now but occasionally I can stretch it to 7 or 8 hours. I clean cages, answer phones, do adoptions, administer meds, organize donations, publish social media content, socialize the cats, feed and water them, etc.

Then I head home and ""decontaminate"" as soon as I get home (take my clothes off and shower because I don't want to give any germs to my cats) and then have the rest of the day to myself. Just chill, make dinner, watch movies or catch up on TV shows, play video games, read. I wish my life was more exciting though. I wish I had energy to go to the gym after work or something but I'm on my feet constantly at work and I'm literally exhausted by the time I get home - it's a very physically demanding job, which, you wouldn't think because they're cats, lol. But it is. I also don't have energy to get dressed up and go back out on dates or to the club or anything, lol. That's not my personality anyway. I'm been a homebody and introvert for about 10 years.

Next day I just repeat the same things. Days off I like to go window shopping, go to thrift stores, hiking, go for walks, read, sleep, pretend to make plans to travel. I get paid minimum wage so I'm stuck in the poverty life cycle and live with my dad currently. I would like to travel more, thought about going back to school, wish I had someone to play frisbee with or pickleball with. It's hard making friends as adults too.

Therefore quite a few are spending their break in the break room with the tv on. 

I get anxiety to walk up to a display or the salad bar and get a small meal. To walk up to the register and pay for my food. Like the thought of people watching me grab a meal and to bring it over to the register. As well as the cashiers or just any employee judging and making commentary.  About the size, the quantity, the price, and the ingredients too. I also feel bad waiting in line with my one water bottle and or my small meal. While there’s customers with full shooing cart.  

There’s a stainless steal bench that’s got three wooden fences around it. It’s over on the other side of the employee parking lot. But it’s kinda the unofficial smokers corner. There’s also this coworker who I kinda had a falling out with. He often times likes to eat his wings there. He doesn’t exactly like me so I try to avoid him and he also works as a cashier.

However I was actually super pleasantly surprised. I don’t know if it’s because I’m from a rough area in London and am used to catcalling, but really it was not bad. I did not feel unsafe at any moment.  For reference I only speak English, and have a tanned appearance as I am of South-Asian descent. I did not really make an effort to dress modestly but I always left with a cardigan in case I felt the need to cover up. I didn’t really use it in the end though. My itinerary was as follows:

Fez

• A bit hectic and some catcalling in the medina.
• Leather tannery was definitely a highlight, however make sure you look up the way on google maps, there will be men trying to tell you you’re going the wrong way and to follow them instead, I just ignored and kept my head down, and persevered on. Many leather shops with a view of the tannery can be found on google maps very easily.
• The oldest university in the world, Quaraouiyine, definitely worth a visit! There are also some terraces where you can view it from above but I didn’t go to any.

Chefchaouen

Probably the safest place I visited in Morocco, I don’t think I got cat called once. Really pretty.
• Spanish Mosque has the best view
• Terrace restaurants in the main square have a lovely view too and are not too pricey

Sahara Desert

I’d heard some stories about women getting sexually harassed on their desert tours. However to the contrary again, I felt super safe, I don’t know if it’s because of the tour I chose but they put us up in luxury camps of single gender. All the men that worked in the camp were super nice.
• Highlight was the camel ride. I wish I picked a tour that offered sandboarding though. I would recommend looking up tours with the best reviews and activities you want, and then basing your itinerary off of that. Because I started in Fez and wanted to finish in Marrakech, the tour options for me were kind of limited. You have lots of options for tour companies if you start in Marrakech and finish in Fez, or do a round trip back to Marrakech.

Marrakech

• Lots of options for day tours, I did some excursions to Atlas Mountains and palm forest.
• The medina is nice, similar to Fez, a bit of catcalling but didn’t feel unsafe.
• I saw police almost everywhere I went, I didn’t feel the need to report anything but if I was getting followed I would have.
• The main square is super hectic, but it’s nice to watch from above at one of the cheap terrace restaurants - I found one which did main dishes for 30-40 dirhams.
• My favourite place was this a cafe called Bacha Coffee, long wait but it was just super beautiful and a great experience
• A guy in my hostel said he got harassed by one of the “snake charmers” in the main square, who demanded money for the picture he took of the snake. But again, idk I didn’t feel it was a big deal, if it was me I would have just walked away lol😅

The news of 2024's Nat Turner joining the board is certainly exciting with respect to GME's continued development of its collectible revenue stream. Although the board tenure is for one year, we can see there have already been fruits born in the month since GameStop paired up with PSA - a company in which Turner owns >10% Equity - to the tune of $1.53 million in collaboration.

**Price Movement Recap**

[GME Trading Day 11\/15 1min Aggregation](https://preview.redd.it/92pt4gb59n1e1.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=c529bbb5ed43e684739ed1dba258983cb4f786bf)

For those of you watching the charts closely on Friday - I certainly was - there was likely a bit of disappointment insofar as we did not get the $30 test that was structured into our hedging landscape and which indeed many traders were betting on. So what gives? Why no test? 

Let me remind us of my remarks on Friday, that a breach of $30 would be - and I quote - ""code red"" for Market Makers and might have resulted in an explosion of T+1 Settlement volume today as they might have sought to put off buying to cover their short call positions on Friday in order to put a lid on the erstwhile gamma squeeze. While this eventuality would not have broken the bank, it seriously would have cut into their profits for the November OPEX cycle. Not swell for the bottom line.

Instead, it appears that Market Makers decided to nip the threat in bud with, as far as I could tell, two very obvious manipulative interventions. Based on our pre-market activity and our price action off the open, traders and institutions came out like gang-busters above $28 in the bullish of the two scenarios I outlined last Friday. Options volume was bullish and heavy off the open, so within about 2 minutes off the open, Market Makers pulled a sneaky with IV jacking it up from 150% to over 190% in an instant (you can see this strange phenomenon on the chart above).

Why do MMs alter IV levels like this? Simple: to mitigate risk to their bottom line. By increasing IV, MMs project a single if-then proposition to the options market - if you want to buy Calls, it's going to cost you. This thus incentives three basic behavioral paths for Call buyers: 1) ""I will buy Calls at a higher premium than before"" 2) ""This premium is too high. I will refrain from buying based on the elevated cost"" 3) ""This IV premium is too good of an opportunity for me to pass up, I will sell my held Calls or write Calls to capture this premium value."" 

If the MMs indeed fear a Gamma Squeeze feedback loop messing with their profits in a meaningfully critical way, all of these three behavioral paths benefit them by reducing buying pressure. As it appears above, MMs used this huge IV spike to incentivize selling from what they correctly assessed to be short-term bullish long Call holders and IV traders. Despite some big inflows, enough selling countered the initial buying flows and kept the price swinging back and forth like a polygraph around the critical $28 gamma strike. 

Enough traders appear to have read the tea leaves in this and, unable to get movement above $28.59, began to sell calls in sizable amounts as the price movement archetype instead began to conform to the '$27 test' archetype I also laid out. A $27 test is indeed what unfolded, but as you recall I wrote in Friday's post that such as downward test would still not prevent a $30 intraday test from unfolding.

Indeed, our hedging structure on the day made it such that a $27 'fake-out' drop would allow institutions to buy-up 0DTE Calls for cheap and then potentially launch the price upward off that key level, incentivizing Call-buying volume to return. Market makers had another trick up their sleeves, also knowing (I propose) that the $30 gamma squeeze was still possible in the $27 test scenario, which still left them vulnerable to the $30 breach-and-hold code red risk. Thus we got this:

https://preview.redd.it/4exbmcsoen1e1.png?width=332&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8bb79d60f620953abe5e54f55930681fbf9916c

Right when the price hit $27 300,000 shares of Short Volume hit the tape in a second and shot the price down to $26.48 before reversing. Yes, indeed, that $8.1mil of instantaneous short volume (why wasn't it routed to a dark pool?) came at exactly the point in the day where the options market was anticipating an intraday entry for a big upward reversal. The upward reversal still came as that short seller immediately turned around and bought to close the position which, buttressed by options volume, carried the price right up to that big $28 gamma position (that sharp V-shape price action is a dead giveaway for a lit short-share dump-and-cover). The thing is, this dumper probably lost money on the trade, as at least half of the covering trend is above the dump price of $27 and 1/4 of it extends above the +/- $0.50 range on that run. At best, the dumper broke even. 

Thus, I am led to believe that this share dump was - as we've seen often before - executed strictly for the purpose of controlling the price, likely in the service of an Options Market Maker strategy. As we can see, this manipulation transformed the $28 gamma position into an upside resistance on the day and probably spooked Call buyers, who traded a head-and-shoulders triple-touch of the $28 gamma line into a bearish close bolstered by Friday's Charm (delta decay over time) -induced share shedding.

The lesson here? Provided my assessment of the situation is correct - without big, meaningful new, MMs will manipulate the trading environment to direct options flows in their favor, especially if the market truly threatens their profitability, as it occurs was indeed in play.

**OI Changes + Max Pain**

With that being said, there is a lot looking up for our immediate future in our options data, though there are plenty of question marks as well (per usual). The first good signs are visible in our Max Pain data:

https://preview.redd.it/ko21uwg19n1e1.png?width=772&format=png&auto=webp&s=85d2e8688f4d5eb02059fa5c5ceafdd7b6fb6f65

This week's expiry (11/22) now shows a Max Pain strike of $23, while all of our December expiries show Max Pains of $23 at minimum, including the 12/20 OPEX - and 12/13 even has a Max Pain of $24! These are always subject to chain based on our our fluctuating OI, but for the meantime this reveals buying patterns last week that have adjusted the points of Market-Maker optimum profitability much closer to our $25-$30 macrobracket and recently elevated trading ranges. Nice!

[11\/22 OI Changes 11\/15-11\/18](https://preview.redd.it/obvqkiz0ln1e1.png?width=1868&format=png&auto=webp&s=c2959ff53f6052ef1f748c30674a7340bbf32cc3)

Understandably we had some new OI opened on both sides of the chain for this week's expiry through rolling and new buying. Our current setup looks like it is forming up to shift us back into a $25-$27 range with $26 lightened in terms of its Call OI and built out in terms of its Put OI. $27 and $25 still have Call OI positions predominating and should offer some stability, but our current premarket price position and the light OI concentration at $26 does suggest that a trading pathway of least resistance for the week would be a consolidating retrace into this area to trade within. 

However, at the same time we also have a sizable amount of Call OI at $27 and $28. If the Nat Turner announcement encourages some bullish sentiment we could flip back into this stable trading zone and replicate some of our price action from the end of last week.

New OI was decidedly light at our future options expiries. Presently this tells me (and I can feel it in my own decision-making) that there is general uncertainty in the options market regarding GME. OI for January is huge with over 400,000 total contracts open already. Traders look to be playing the current landscape one week at a time without a clear idea for when or exactly how our impending price movement structures will develop over the next few months - besides 'up.'

https://preview.redd.it/9olhbt95qn1e1.png?width=407&format=png&auto=webp&s=f77384ec12ada34c2de06c254efe6b940545b6bb

Our Put/Call GEX ratio trend has come off its very very high bullish reading of 1:5 to a still bullish reading of slightly less than than 1:4. This is to be somewhat expected from the huge amount of Call Gamma that was wiped off the board after Nov OPEX - over 1 Million - and the low amount of Put Gamma overall. If the Nat Turner news is interpreted as a 'bullish externality' by the market, this might drive call-buying enough to shoot us right back to the ratio we saw at the end of last week. If the market 'reacts neutrally' to the news, then we might see a $25 test scenario materialize based on what I'm seeing projected in our hedging structure:

https://preview.redd.it/t1fuxxehpn1e1.png?width=502&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ccc0de3860ad83cc4e567a116d59408bfac1ab1

So here we can see why the sub-$27 close was important for MMs on Friday. Between $27 and $25 we have a gamma hedge deadzone with a small speedbump at $26 in the middle of it. Based on our early premarket price action (where we moved down to $26.01) an open at this level or in the middle of the $26-$27 could easily bring out a $27 upward test, followed by a downside reversal that would proceed pretty smoothly until hitting support at $25. IV might depress a bit in this case and then allow traders to re-enter calls at $25 or just above for a midweek retrace back to $27, but ultimately close below that mark again for a week of consolidation after the apparent 'rejection' (lol) of bullish movement past $28.59.

If the Nat Turner announcement turns out to be a bullish catalyst, this could serve as an impetus to carry us back up into our $27-$28 range in order to prepare this week (really nothing has happened so far premarket, so we can assume that this really took big players by surprise as they appear not to have had a pre-planned market response to this news). At present, I lean away from expecting this happen, in part to counter my wishful thinking and in part because nothing has happened in premarket in response. It will be still be worthwhile to take this price scenario into consideration even if it is a less-than-likely occurrence.

**Technicals**

Our suspicious course-redirection on Friday has also had some implications for our technicals, but more so in the short term, than the longer-term. Indeed, our bullish trend is well-intact, but does seem positioned for a small consolidatory correction:

[1-Week Aggregation](https://preview.redd.it/q0ricogkvn1e1.png?width=1503&format=png&auto=webp&s=8bae800193a5d0df20e1f9b9185ac2acf5e4687c)

On our weekly chart, we project some potential so consolidate beneath the 200-week moving average as it continues its march upward and move relatively sideways into the Q3 earnings report, which presumably would serve as a 'boom-or-bust' breakout point into 2025. Presently, the Options market as a whole seems to be betting on continued bullish divergence, but the fate our price action is by no means clear from these technicals alone.

On our 1-hr and 4-hr aggregation charts, we see this pattern suggested at higher resolutions, especially insofar as our Friday interventions forced a downward break of our wedgeform pattern's culmination at that time:

[10\/18-11\/18 1-hr Aggregation](https://preview.redd.it/2ldsvm4lwn1e1.png?width=1493&format=png&auto=webp&s=9cf23f0a22b93781c2271b5c90af6f6082311cdc)

[10\/18-11\/18 4-hr Aggregation](https://preview.redd.it/9f7nli2axn1e1.png?width=1492&format=png&auto=webp&s=370e028f2283b5cc9bce379ff21eff30aeb31528)

Thus we can see, there was a golden technical opportunity for MMs (relative bears to our current price levels) to set up a consolidation pattern into this week, not only as I pointed to above in our options data, but with the convergence of those key gamma levels with our Simple Moving Averages on the 1-hr and 4-hr charts. A movement downward toward $25 runs into a strong positive gamma position as well as an oversold signal on the RSI and technical support at the 200-hr SMA while returning RSI to Neutral levels (=50) on the 4-hr chart and setting up tests of the 50-4hr SMA which we have shown not only general-trend respect for, but price-specific respect for (Tuesday 11/12 Premarket dump to $23.50). 

This consolidatory technical movement would play out over the course of a week as I've drawn it up in the charts above and then close the week (ceteris paribus) in a position to continue our overall bullish momentum (at present I think the more likely scenario) or embrace some 'bearish' catalyst at the will of the Market Makers.

I'd much prefer our price action respond enthusiastically to Nat Turner's board appointment rather than just play out this technical scenario. However, if I remove speculation on the sentimental character of the reaction to this news (and what I would personally like to see play out based on my long-stock, long-call open, bullish position in the company) this low-volatility consolidating correction is what I would forecast.

**IV Trends**

[10-Day Mean Implied Volatility](https://preview.redd.it/eaj8e8799n1e1.png?width=1172&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac844c944f30cefea01173932f86dc71ab87b9db)

[Schwab IV](https://preview.redd.it/3ri0g222zn1e1.png?width=1452&format=png&auto=webp&s=03ede3185992ee4b4b1910c89309b43cf9bd6171)

IV levels are still greatly elevated at over 140%, making IV sales targeting January expiries something like 8-10x as profitable as they were two months ago, but not as high as the 16-18x that they were at market open on Friday with that 5min IV spike to 190%. Consolidation should lower IV values back into the 120th percent range over the course of a week if that is indeed the scenario we see play out. I wouldn't be surprised if we were to see a two week cool-off 'programmed' by our MM overlords in order for them to set themselves and their hedge fund arms as optimally as possible ahead of the Q3 earnings IV ramp-up that should begin right around Thanksgiving, if the 12/10-12/11 report date estimation is correct. 

**Synthesis + TA;DR**

Our Options Data and our Technicals project consolidation and a downward test of $25 as our path of least resistance. MMs looked to have structured our close last week in order to put us in prime position to 'embrace' this downward retrace, which would move us to within $1-$2 of their current (ideal) optimal profit points at $23 and $24 over the entirety of the next month as it stands.

Our wild card here is market reaction to the Nat Turner Board announcement. So far, despite what should telegraph the growth of an extremely high-margin revenue stream expansion for the company - collectibles - we have essentially no reaction to this in our pre-market price action. Who knows what this will mean intraday? 

Let's keep our eyes on our data, watch our price action closely, and see what happens! Cheers and good luck out there, everyone!

Open Interest (this post) is not \*trade advice\*. Its aim is epistemic or, if you prefer, scientific in nature, namely that the goal is to ascertain knowledge whose truth claim is that it confers some degree of predictive power. This is to say that the 'proof' of this is in whether advantageous use, however construed, can be made of the knowledge which I derive from observation and analysis by my particular methods. I use this knowledge to my advantage by continually updating, reassessing, and renewing my own investment thesis on continuing to HODL $GME. I happen to use a conservative wheel strategy (using CSPs and CCs to replace limit buys and limit sells) in order to maintain this position. How you put this knowledge to your advantage - if you should seek to - is up to you to discover and apply for yourself as an individual investor. Feel free, however, to ask as many questions as you please! I will do my best to share my experience and insight.

Fake names for obvious reasons. Also I’m so sorry how long this got :( 

I (18f) went to a club last weekend with a group of friends one of which included Jimmy (19m). Jimmy was talking with me before we went in about what classes I was taking next semester. I told him I hadn’t done my registration yet but would try to this week. Jimmy told me I should join a certain class because Ben (19m) would be in it and I could try to ask him out.

For context, a couple months earlier, Ben (a friend of Jimmy’s) had hit on me a couple times and I rejected him but eventually I asked if he wanted to grab coffee which he agreed to. However, we cancelled and never ended up rescheduling. Right after this I started talking to Anthony (18m) and I have really started to like him. So when Jimmy suggested this, I told him I’d check out the class but I wasn’t interested in Ben since Anthony and I are talking so much. Jimmy kept pressing and asking “even if Ben asked you out you would say no?” and I kept replying “I’m really not interested in Ben so I’m not going out with him.”

We get in the club and Jimmy is clearly in a bad mood being tense to our friends and just acting weird. At one point, Jimmy looks at me and asks “If you and Ben were in the same class together do you think you would have a hard time being professional with him?” This catches me off guard and I ask why that would be an issue. Jimmy goes on to tell me since I had a “thing” with Ben it may be difficult for me to work closely with him without getting emotional. This gets me really pissed and I keep reiterating I’m not into Ben and my personal and school/work life are two separate things entirely. I told him if anyone made it unprofessional it sure as hell wouldn’t be me not to mention I am already interested in someone else.

On top of all this, the field I’m studying is male dominated making this comment more offensive to me because I don’t think Jimmy would ask that kind of question to a guy. I would’ve said more to Jimmy in the moment had we not been in such a busy space (especially considering he was interested in a classmate but it didn’t work out) but I think going back and trying to retroactively talk with him may make things worse. I’m also very bad when it comes to confrontation and tend to bottle things up best I can. I feel like I may be overreacting about the whole thing since I doubt he meant it to come across that way but I’m really bothered. My friends all sided with me but I want outside opinions.

If I order a Skywalker v1 from Artizan Coffee, I'd pay \~900$ CAD (USD to CAD & customs).   I'm planning to roast approximately 1 kg/week.

The Skywalker v2 is interesting but I'd rather wait a bit to see the reviews / comments.

What should I do ?

I've asked ChatGPT to sum up both product and I feel like the Hottop is more durable and easier to fix when it breaks.

Here's a comparison between the Skywalker V1 and the Hottop KN-8828B-2K+ coffee roasters:

| **Temperature Monitoring**      | Built-in thermistor  | Dual K-type thermocouples for bean and environmental temperatures  |
| **Cooling System**              | Integrated cooling system  | External cooling tray with forced air  |
| **Smoke Management**            | Smoke filter for smokeless operation  | Two-stage air filter to reduce smoke  |

**Considerations:**
- **Budget:** The Skywalker V1 is more budget-friendly, while the Hottop KN-8828B-2K+ is a significant investment.
- **Control and Precision:** The Hottop offers advanced control features and seamless software integration, making it suitable for users seeking precise roast profiling.
- **Capacity Needs:** If you require larger batch sizes, the Skywalker V1's higher capacity may be advantageous.
- **Technical Expertise:** The Skywalker V1 may require modifications for software integration, which could be a consideration if you prefer a plug-and-play solution.

1gu54y8,https://www.reddit.com/r/gout_and_diet/comments/1gu54y8/coffee_itself_not_caffeine_reduces_risk_of_gout/,"Coffee Itself, Not Caffeine, Reduces Risk of Gout","BOSTON, May 25 -- At relatively high daily doses, coffee -- whether regular or decaf -- may protect against gout, researchers here found.



In a large observational study, regular consumption of six or more cups a day was associated with 0.43 mg/dl lower serum uric acid levels compared with no coffee intake at all, said Hyon K. Choi, M.D., Dr.P.H., and Gary Curhan, M.D., Sc.D., both of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.



While Americans average only two cups a day, the fact that coffee is readily available everywhere may make the findings important to public health, they wrote in the June issue of Arthritis Care & Research.



""This level of population mean difference of serum uric acid levels can be translated into a clinically relevant difference in the risk for incident gout,"" they said.



A previous study in middle-age Japanese men had established that coffee might lower gout risk, but it was not clear whether caffeine was responsible.



So the researchers looked at data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). Their analysis included a nationally representative sample of 14,758 men and women.



Participants underwent a medical examination and reported coffee and tea intake in a food frequency questionnaire administered during the home interview portion of the survey.



The mean age of participants was 45, and more than half of them drank at least one cup of coffee a day. Only 169 had six or more cups a day; 590 drank four or five cups a day.



The mean serum uric acid level was 5.32 mg/dl, and 18% of participants had hyperuricemia, the precursor of gout.



After adjusting for age and sex, the researchers found:



* Coffee intake of four to five cups daily was associated with 0.26 mg/dl lower serum uric acid levels compared with no intake (95% confidence interval 0.11 to 0.41).
* Six or more cups a day was associated with 0.43 mg/dl lower serum uric acid levels compared with no intake (95% CI 0.23 to 0.65, odds ratio 0.57, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.94).
* A significant trend for lower levels with higher intake, which remained significant after adjustment for decaffeinated coffee and tea intake (P<0.001 for trend).
* Decaffeinated coffee alone yielded a similar 0.39-mg/dl reduction in uric acid in the highest intake category (four cups or more a day) compared with no intake, but the difference was not significant.
* The trend for an inverse association between decaffeinated coffee intake and serum uric acid levels was significant, even when further adjusting for tea intake (P=0.035 for trend).
* Tea intake was not associated with any decrease in risk (P=0.71 for trend in even the least adjusted model).





Increasing total caffeine from coffee, tea, and other drinks was not associated with decreasing serum uric acid levels in a multivariate analysis (P=0.14 for trend).



Further adjusting the multivariate models for caffeine intake left the associations with coffee virtually unchanged.



""The inverse association with coffee appears to be via components of coffee other than caffeine,"" Drs. Choi and Curhan said.



The explanation for the findings may be that non-caffeine compounds in coffee, such as the antioxidant chlorogenic acid, lower insulin levels and increase insulin sensitivity. Insulin resistance has been strongly linked in other studies to elevated uric acid levels.



Whatever the mechanism, it is likely that the effects seen in the study would be clinically significant, the researchers noted.



In a previous study looking at Health Professionals Follow-up Study data, the researchers had found that an increase in mean serum uric acid level of 0.4 mg/dl-similar in magnitude, though in the opposite direction-was associated with a 50% increased risk of incident gout.



But, that doesn't necessarily mean patients should start drinking more coffee, Dr. Choi said.



The results suggest that there is no need to reduce or discontinue drinking coffee for those who have gout or are at elevated risk because of high serum uric acid or a strong family history of gout, he said.



Coffee is considered generally safe when consumed in moderation-typically defined as up to three cups a day-but higher intake may risk calcium loss and caffeine dependence, Dr. Choi cautioned.



While decaf coffee may yield similar benefits without the caffeine-induced risks, patients should be counseled based on an individual benefit-risk assessment, he said.

In a large observational study, regular consumption of six or more cups a day was associated with 0.43 mg/dl lower serum uric acid levels compared with no coffee intake at all, said Hyon K. Choi, M.D., Dr.P.H., and Gary Curhan, M.D., Sc.D., both of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.



While Americans average only two cups a day, the fact that coffee is readily available everywhere may make the findings important to public health, they wrote in the June issue of Arthritis Care & Research.



""This level of population mean difference of serum uric acid levels can be translated into a clinically relevant difference in the risk for incident gout,"" they said.

The owner of these channels creates a shocking amount of content. 

We are at the point in which internet was in the late 1990s. Spam originated and people decided to fight with it. For example we don't allow spammers to create multiple accounts and post thousands of similar messages on forums that no human could possibly generate. Platform owners decided to fight bots because for any normal human being they're not desirable, they pollute the internet and make it impossible to see real human messages. 

The same decision should be done now when thousands of channels are generated with hundreds of songs each, they pollute playlists, search results, recommendation engine etc. If that cancer of AI is not going to be stopped soon thousands will turn into millions, and then billions. The ratio of AI-to-real songs will be so large the chance of us to get any legitimate recommendations will be close to zero. Real artists who devoted their lives to music will lose all visibility on the platform because their share in the recommendation engine will gradually drop to 0.0001%. 

If Spotify doesn't do something about this cancer of AI then soon it will become unusable and we will have to start torrenting music again like in the year 2000. 

In my opinion AI generated music should be put on a separate platform if Spotify wants to continue allowing this. On the ""real"" platform AI should not be allowed. It's like with P\*rnHub - on they main service they don't allow any homos\*xual videos because their heteros\*xual audience doesn't want that to pop up in recommendations but they want to stay in the business in that niche so they have a completely separate service just for homos\*xual videos. That way both niches of the market have a choice which service to use. ",1,1731937751.0,truespotify,0,0.6,False

Pet shedding is just part of life with our furry friends, but there are ways to deal with it without losing your sanity.

Here’s a simple guide to help you keep the fur in check.

# Why is shedding so intense?

Shedding is totally normal pets lose fur to make way for new growth.  
But sometimes, it can feel like they’re shedding enough to knit a new pet.

Here’s what might be causing excessive shedding:

* **Seasonal changes**: Pets shed more in spring and fall as they adjust their coats.
* **Diet issues**: Poor nutrition can lead to brittle fur and extra shedding.
* **Stress**: Big changes, like moving or new routines, can make them lose more hair.
* **Skin problems**: Allergies, parasites, or infections might be to blame.

Figuring out the cause is the first step to solving the problem.

# Ways to reduce shedding

Dealing with fur doesn’t have to be complicated.  
Here are some tips that actually work:

# 1. brush, brush, brush

Regular brushing is your best weapon against shedding.  
It removes loose fur before it spreads all over your house.

* For **short-haired pets**, use a grooming glove or soft-bristle brush.
* For **long-haired pets**, go for a slicker brush or deshedding tool.

Aim to brush a few times a week or daily during heavy shedding seasons.

# 2. feed them right

A healthy coat starts with good nutrition.  
Make sure your pet’s diet includes omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, which are great for skin and fur health.

If you’re not sure their diet is up to par, talk to your vet about supplements or a food upgrade.

# 3. bathe smartly

Bathing your pet helps remove loose fur and keeps their coat in good condition.

Use a gentle, pet-safe shampoo, and don’t overdo it.  
Too many baths can dry out their skin, making shedding worse.

# 4. clean up effectively

No matter how much you groom, some fur will always make its way onto your furniture and clothes.

Here’s how to stay on top of it:

* Vacuum regularly, especially where your pet spends most of their time.
* Keep lint rollers handy for quick touch-ups.
* Use washable pet covers for their favorite spots.

# When to seek help

Excessive shedding can sometimes signal a bigger problem.

If you notice bald patches, irritated skin, or unusual behavior, it’s worth checking in with your vet.  
They can rule out issues like allergies, infections, or hormonal imbalances.

# Final thoughts

Shedding is just part of the deal when you have pets, but it doesn’t have to take over your life.  
With regular grooming, a balanced diet, and a little extra cleaning effort, you can keep the fur under control.

It feels like I can't stop. I try to hold it together at work, at least. The last thing I want is for people to see me like this. But no matter how hard I try to push the tears back, they just keep coming. Sometimes it feels like they’ll never stop, like I’m drowning in them. Even now, as I stand behind the counter at Starbucks, I can feel them pushing against my eyes, threatening to spill over. I’m supposed to be good at this making coffee, smiling, chatting with customers but right now, everything feels so… far away. The world is happening around me, and I’m just stuck here, floating through it like I’m not really here. People smile at me. They ask for their drinks, and I give them what they want. But inside, I’m falling apart, piece by piece. It’s not just the breakup. It’s the feeling of losing myself. Like there was a part of me that was wrapped up in that person, and now that they’re gone, that piece of me is missing. I don’t know who I am anymore without them. I feel like I’m just walking through life, pretending to be someone I used to be. I’m pretending to be okay, but it doesn’t feel real. It doesn’t feel like me. I wish I could just turn it off. I wish I could find a way to feel nothing, just for a little while. Anything to stop the ache in my chest. The emptiness. The loneliness. I don’t have the energy to keep feeling this way. I don’t have the strength to keep carrying this weight on my shoulders. It’s exhausting. It’s draining. I keep asking myself, “How long is this going to last?” I feel like I’m stuck in a place I can’t escape from. It’s like I’m in this deep pit of sadness, and no matter how much I try to climb out, I slip right back down. Every time. It’s not even about the relationship anymore. It’s about what’s left after. The pieces of me that are scattered on the floor, trying to figure out how to put myself back together. But I don’t even know where to start. Who am I without them? What do I even want anymore? I feel so alone. Like I have no one to talk to, no one who truly understands how broken I feel inside. People say time heals everything, but right now, time feels like the enemy. I need something now. I just want to feel better, even if it’s just for a little bit. I want to stop crying. I want to stop feeling like this is all I’ll ever be. I can’t tell anyone at work what I’m going through. They’d just look at me like I’m weak. Like I can’t handle things. But the truth is, I can’t. I don’t know how much longer I can keep pretending. When I get home at night, I sit in my bed and I just cry. I cry until I fall asleep. But the next morning, I wake up, and it’s the same thing all over again. I don’t know how to make it stop. I just want to feel numb, like it’s all gone. Maybe if I could numb the pain, it wouldn’t hurt so much. Maybe if I could forget for a little while, I could breathe again. But I don’t know how to do that. I just keep going through the motions, trying to get through the day. Trying to get through each minute. And I keep telling myself that I’ll be okay eventually. But right now, it’s hard to believe that. All I know is that I miss myself. The person I used to be.

After I heard my stop, I let the words wash over me, a list of places I’d never been and would likely never go — the soundtrack of my morning commute. 

A few minutes later, the train screeched into the station, adding to the tang of metal and diesel fumes hanging in the air. The other commuters waiting on the platform surged forward, carrying me with them like a leaf caught in the flow of the stream. Together, we jostled our way onto the train.

I wasn’t one of the lucky few who found an empty seat, instead standing in a vestibule between carriages next to a toilet I hoped nobody would use, crammed uncomfortably close to the others with me. A well dressed middle aged man, clearly a veteran of the commute, sat propped up on his suitcase. A younger man was so glued to his phone that he almost fell when the train lurched into motion. Then, there was her.

I’d seen her a few times on my commute, as I had most of the poor souls who caught the same train each day alongside me. Her bright dress stood out amid the grey and navy suits with white shirts, the light weight, floral fabric floating around her with every shift and sway of the train. She stared out the small window in the door, watching the world zoom by. She looked so content — at peace. I wondered what her secret was.

The train slowed unexpectedly. I gripped the handrail tighter, fighting the pull of the decceleration as best I could. The younger man wasn’t so fortunate, stumbling, his phone skittering across the phone towards me. I stopped it with my foot, waiting until the train had stopped completely to reach down and pick it up, handing it back to him.

“Thanks,” he muttered, as his eyes glued themselves to the screen once more.

The tannoy system binged and bonged to life. “Apologies for the unexpected delay. We’re caught behind an earlier delayed stopping service which we won’t be able to pass until Sheffield. Estimated arrival into Leeds is now half past eight, with Wakefield Westgate at ten to nine.”

That was my journey time almost doubled. I could wave goodbye to the coffee and breakfast sandwich I’d been looking forward to picking up on my walk to work. And clearly, I wasn’t the only one. A collective sigh went up from everyone around me — everyone except her. She just smiled, shook her head, and rummaged in her bag pulling out a book.

The train felt like it was crawling after that, every kilometre travelled delaying us further and further, every minute delay increasing the pressure building in my chest. I was going to be late. I was going to have to run from the station, and I’d still be late. Sweaty, dishevelled, and late. The sweat was already pricking at my skin, as if in anticipation. Heat was creeping over me. I shifted my weight from side to side, unbuttoning my cardigan in an attempt to breathe. I could feel my hair sticking to the back of my neck. With a shudder, I pulled it up, scraping it into a ponytail that was probably far from perfect, but it would have to do, for now.

“Are you alright?” the woman asked, looking at me over the top of her book.

I looked around, assuming she was talking to a friend I couldn’t see. I mean, who would talk to a random stranger on a train?

“Yes, you,” she said again, sharp green eyes definitely fixed on me. “Are you alright?”

“Me? I’m fine,” I said, though the words came out tight and breathless. “Just a little stressed about the delay.” I looked at my watch as if to emphasise the point. “I’m going to be late to work.”

She smiled, shrugging slightly. “I suspect we all are. But there’s not much we can do about it, right? So we might as well just enjoy the ride.”

I nodded non-commitally. 

“And don’t forget to breathe.” She leaned in closer, whispering, “Even if it does smell like something died in here. Some people really need to learn how to use deodorant.” Her eyes flicked between our other travel companions, a cheeky grin on her face.

I snorted slightly, stifling a laugh.

“Here,” she rummaged in her handbag again. The thing was huge, a colourful geometric pattern woven across it, the large wooden handles threaded over an arm that looke too delicate to support such a weight. Eventually, she found what she was looking for, pulling out a box of tic-tacs. “Would you like one?”

“Sure. Thanks.” I held out a hand and she tipped out a few into it, which I gladly chucked into my mouth. That was probably all the food I was getting until lunchtime now.

She offered them around to the others in the vestibule, but everyone else just shook their heads.

“So where is it that you work?” she asked.

I hurriedly crunched the last of the tic-tacs. “Just a tech consultancy in Wakefield.”

“You like it there?”

I shrugged. “It pays the bills.”

“So why are you so eager to get there?”

“So that I don’t get in trouble for being late.”

Her freckles twitched as she stifled a laugh, shaking her head. “You can hardly get in trouble for your train being delayed. That is, unless you work for the train company and this is all your fault.”

I held up my hands. “I’m innocent, I swear! Though I’m not sure my boss would agree. He’s a real stickler for these things. One of those ‘no excuses’ sorts who can’t tell the difference between a valid reason and an excuse.”

“Well, that sounds like his problem, to me. Just give me his name and number and I’ll give him a piece of my mind for you.”

“Thanks, but I should probably fight my own battles.” 

“If you say so.” She paused, looking out the window as the countryside crawling by was slowly replaced with grey concrete. “So what is it that you do work on, if it isn’t trains?” she asked, turning back to me.

“It’s mainly stock and inventory managing systems.”

“Sounds like exciting stuff.” Her voice had a teasing edge, green eyes twinkling slightly.

“Oh yeah, and what is it that you do which is clearly so much more fascinating than my work?”

“I work at a tea shop in Leeds. We sell over a hundred different types of tea.”

“A hundred eh? Fascinating.”

She let herself laugh fully this time, a jaunty melodic sound that I couldn’t help but smile at. “You should stop by sometime. I’ll let you smell them all and send you home with more tea than you can drink in your lifetime.”

A bing followed by a bon interrupted me before I could reply. The tannoy system cracked into life. “Train is now approaching Leeds approximately twenty minutes behind schedule. We apologise for this delay to your journey. Please make sure you have all your belongings with you when you leave the train, and please mind the gap between the train and the platform edge.”

“This is my stop,” she said, as the train crawled into the station. “But maybe I’ll see you again tomorrow, eh? Same time? Same train?”

“Or, I could take you up on your offer to smell over a hundred different types of tea.”

The train jerked to a stop.  She tucked her book back in her bag and hoisted it onto her shoulder. “What about your work?”

“I’ll call in sick.” The train doors beeped as they hissed open.

“My, what a rebel. I think I’m a bad influence on you.” She brushed past me, practically skipping off of the train before turning back and holding out a hand for me. “Come on then, if you’re serious.”

I hurriedly wiped the sweat from my palm before slipping my hand into hers. Her skin was soft and cool, her touch calming in the sea of chaos that was the station. I followed her through the crowd, caught in her slipstream. It was only then, that I realised I didn’t even know her name, this woman I was playing truant for, this woman who I’d followed off the train.

She glanced over her shoulder at me, as if reading my thoughts. “I’m Emily, by the way. And you are?”

I wasn’t sure where this was going, but I was certain of one thing. I was going to enjoy the ride.

Have been trying to shed a few lbs on 1400 calories per day and not seeing any results after two weeks.

I’m questioning if my calorie source is correct. I’m mostly eating fresh food and weighing/measuring it, using my fitness pal for calories and tracking. 

I’ve cut out all “extra” sources of calories like coffee etc. Nothing but water, or water with calorie free flavour enhancers and 1 can of Diet Pepsi on Fridays. 

I am on a plethora of medications because I have an autoimmune disease and I do retain water. However I have been able to successfully lose weight in the past on 1400cals so I don’t think that’s it. 

If anyone has any other suggestions I’m open!

I initially started uploading day in the life vlogs (that I made private because of few views), then uploaded an art video that got around 2k views, and then some travel vlogs which also has more than 1k views.

My channel at the moment is a mix of art, lifestyle vlogs, fan girl (kpop), and travel vlogs (majority of my videos). My recent travel vlog is picking up at the moment at 8k views and added almost a hundred to my sub count. My dilemma right now is that since it's been a year since I last uploaded an art vlog, some of my subs might not like the change in topic and unsub once I upload a new art related video. 

Do you guys think I should create a new channel for my art? I think I'm quite good with digital/traditional art but I don't really have much time to draw + film + edit + post to make a weekly upload (considering the algorithm). Also, I was thinking if ever I ran out of travel videos to edit, one of my options for a vlog on my channel will be like ""making art in a coffee shop in [somewhere]"" or anything mixing lifestyle/travel & art. 😅 

I love both travelling and making art so I really don't know what to do. Do any of you have 2 separate channels for each hobby? How did it go? What are your thoughts on channels that have more than one niche? 

Please let me know. Thank you and best of luck to all of us!!

So, as the title says, here's (part of) my collection! They're not all here because unfortunately, I immigrated some years ago and had to leave some pens back with my folks. But these are my favorite, so it's no big deal.

I recently grew my collection by a LOT because, in a conversation with a coworker who retired (and left the country), I discovered she is a fellow pen aficionada. Before leaving, she invited me over for coffee and showed me her HUGE collection, and then gifted me a bunch of pens (such as all the Hongdian you see there, plus the TWSBI, the Pilot Prera and a few others I don't know the brand of, like the starry one.) She also left me a glass pen and a ton of notebooks too. It felt like Christmas to me!

For reference, this coworker is 40+ years older than me, so the conversation was very interesting, hehe.

Anyway, if any pen connoisseurs could help me identify the starry pen (6th pen counting from the left in bottom most row, the one with stars and moons), I would be very grateful\~

Have a good day everyone!

On the other hand he helps pick up things i need from the shops, drives me to some of my appointments, and always buys me whatever i ask for (which is 75% food related). 

we both come from difficult families, knowing what it’s like to want to escape one’s house and have some peace. we are very open about our trauma and mental health with each other. 

last night, he texted he was going to bed at 7:30pm because he has a big day tomorrow at the office. Around 5 minutes later (when I saw the text) I quickly replied asking if I could call because there had been a fight in the family and I needed someone to talk to about it all. He didn’t reply so I facetimed him twice, but he didn’t pick up. I then figured he was asleep so I texted not to worry and goodnight. But i missed him, and i didn’t want to be at home. So I drove over to his place, and when I walked in I saw he was awake and playing video games. When I walked in he looked at me and said “what’s up?” looking confused as to why I was over. He then finished the game a minute later while I sat on his bed. He then went to shower. While in the shower he left his phone next to the bed, so I looked at it to see if he saw any of my messages or missed calls. He had read the messages and seen the missed calls. I then proceeded to cry when I confronted him, about why he didn’t answer or reply when I texted him that I needed to talk because of something serious with my family. He admitted it was selfish and apologised, but didn’t seem to feel too bad about it. So I cried some more then told him it was over, he said he loved me but that he understood. 

Keep in mind that this is the fifth or sixth time he has lied to me or made a serious mistake because he has chosen 
himself over my needs.

1gu4suc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1gu4suc/can_someone_explain_this_wanton_food_waste_to_me/,Can someone explain this wanton food waste to me?,"My ex, with whom I am still friendly, is back in town from deployment for a few days, and is staying in my guest room.

The primary causes for our breakup were 1. that he is an extremely messy person and he was constantly leaving his clutter all over my house (sometimes literal trash, such as take out containers just left on the coffee table as a permanent art installation apparently), and 2. extreme food waste.

He would constantly bring home groceries (mainly meat) for 15 people, cook it all up, and then fill the fridge to the brim with left overs. Food that didn't fit in the fridge anymore would just get left out. 

If I left town for a three day weekend, it would be standard for me to hire cleaners to clean the kitchen while I was gone on Friday, and by the time I came back on Sunday morning the kitchen would be completely trashed, the fridge so full that I could not even fit in a sandwich, and about three gallons of sea food soup sitting out on the stove unrefrigerated for the past two days. Just INSANE.

Folks, believe me, I used my words. I said, ""My primary experience of this relationship is that you just constantly trash my house."" I gestured at the dining room table 12 inches deep in his clutter.

I repeatedly said, ""I DO NOT WANT TO BE THE CUSTODIAN OF ROTTING FOOD."" I repeatedly asked him not to leave food out on the counters unrefrigerated. I repeatedly asked him not to buy family size everything at the grocery store. When he wanted to invite his friends over for grilling, I repeatedly said it was absolutely fine to have his friends over but he needed to clean up after himself and not cook for 15 people if only 3 were coming and then fill the fridge with 4 weeks worth of leftovers.

At one point, I threw out everything that was rotting in the fridge, put everything of his that was still good on one shelf, and said he was not to buy or bring any more food until he had eaten the leftovers on his shelf. (Keep in mind, he had his own apartment the whole time, he just chose to permanently live at and trash mine.)

Finally, I ended the relationship and said he needed to get himself, all of his things, and all of his leftover food out of my house and back into his own apartment.

It then took me several months of working at it 15 minutes a day to really get the house clean again after he left. There are still items of his in the basement and in the guest bedroom, but overall I am back to living a life where the kitchen counters are cleared once a day, clothes live in the closet, and I am not contantly dealing with spoiled food both outside and inside the fridge.

I also started a HungryRoot subscription, which means every week a box of groceries arrives at my door in which exactly the amount of food I will eat at home for the week arrives, gets eaten, and then a new box comes. I eat out several times a week, so I only order about 3/4 of a week worth of food from HungryRoot, and then the fridge effortlessly stays clean because only an amount of food that can and will be eaten enters the house in the first place.

So anyway, cut to this weekend. Ex is back in town to attend to a family matter, and since he gave up his apartment when he last got deployed, he asked to stay in my guest bedroom.

He arrived Friday evening at 11pm after my friends and I (who were queued up on the sofa to watch Tyson v Paul) had already eaten. He sets about ordering food for himself and soon he is entering the house with an ENTIRE SHEET PIZZA. Instantly I am like, ""Uh, do you have a plan for where that entire sheet pizza is going to go that is not my dining table for the next three days?"" He explains to us that the pizza is going to go ""in his belly.""

I should state at this point that this man is not 450lbs. He is 175lbs of lean muscle mass and has, by a considerable margin, the best body of anyone I have ever dated. He eats large amounts of lean protein, zero sugar and firmly believes that every day is leg day. Betchy'all weren't expecting that, but suffice to say he does not actually binge on entire sheet pizzas for dinner. The amount of food he ACTUALLY EATS is totally reasonable and healthy. It's the buying ten times that amount and letting it sit around rotting that I don't get.

Anyway, I make very clear that I better not see a sheet pizza sitting out when I wake up in the morning and go to bed. In the morning, I discover that he has filled three large tupperware bowls with the rest of the pizza and put them in the fridge. There is also a completely unopened foot long sub in the fridge, still in its bag from whereever he got it from. Ok...

On Sunday, he wants to have his two friends over to watch the football game and grill. I say it's fine with me as long as he cleans up after himself.

So, how much meat did he grill for the four of us? Let's see:
An entire family pack of 20 chicken drumsticks.
Roughly a lb of salmon on a cedar plank.
Two 16oz steaks.
Two bacon wrapped filets.
6 cheese stuffed portabellas.

His friends bring a box ofnbeyond burgers because apparently one of them is vegetarian.

So, at the end of the evening, I am packing about 15 drumsticks, 1/2 of a steak, 3/4lb of salmon, 2 bacon wrapped filets and 5 cheese stuffed portabellas into food storage containers.
There are also four different bottles of hot sauce, a bottle of steak sauce, and a bottle of jalapeno ketchup on the counter.

I ask him what his plan is for all this food before he leaves again in three days. I tell him that I do not want to become the new owner and custodian of 6 new condiment bottles in my fridge as I do not eat hot sauce or jalapeno ketchup. I ask him what his plan is for the three large bowls full of vegan sheet pizza slices that are in the bottom of the fridge and also the completely untouched foot long. He says he is going to bring the sub with him to his family obligation tomorrow. Really? I ask him. After its been sitting for three days you are going to eat this sub? Why not just wait to buy a fresh sub on Monday?

I point at the stack of food storage containers full of freshly grilled meat on the counter and point out that there is no room for them in the fridge because the fridge currently has THREE LARGE BOWLS filled with pizza slices in it. I ask him to figure out how he is going to physically fit the grilled meat leftover into the fridge. I tell him that I have my regularly scheduled HungryRoot delivery coming tomorrow (which gets ordered like a week and a half in advance) and there is already no room left in the fridge for me to put my own food. I also have a weeks worth of meals on the way so I have no capacity to eat two weeks worth of leftovers on top.

I tell him that I think his plan is to fill up the fridge with food he knows he is never going to eat, and then he is going to go back to his deployment on Wednesday and leave me to deal with all of the food and take care of throwing it out.

I emphasize that he KNOWS the insane food waste drives me bananas and that this is a conversation we have had a thousand times.

His response yesterday evening was to throw out the sub and all of the pizza slices (leaving the three tupperware bowls for me to clean of course), and stack the grilled meat in the bottom of the fridge.

I am tempted to take a picture of the grilled meat and put it on buy nothing, in which case someone from the neighborhood would almost instantly come and get it, but it's his food and he isn't leaving until Wednesday so probably it will all stay in the fridge untouched until it is juuuussst old enough that you can't reasonably offer it up on buy nothing anymore. ""Hey, we grilled this LAST NIGHT and aren't going to get to it"" is a whole different story from ""Yeah we grilled this three days ago"".

Can somebody please explain this pathology to me? He does not have an eating disorder. He does not overeat or binge and purge. He is an intelligent, decent, generally kind person with a top secret security clearance who once had a job at the White House. He has full command of the English language, social skills, and the ability to empathize with other people.

He literally lost a relationship over this behavior and still it continues.

WHAT ON EARTH is this compulsion to buy way more food than he could ever eat and then leave it around to rot?

WHAT ON EARTH is this compulsion to continue doing this in SOMEONE ELSE'S HOUSE when they have repeatedly made clear that it is not ok with them.

The combination of the insane food waste in itself PLUS the total disrespect of another person, their house and their space as a separate and additional issue is just mind boggling to me from this otherwise decent individual.

Does anyone have a name for this or some kind of explanation? When an otherwise intelligent, decent, and functional person is just completely incapable of changing this kind of behavior I really start to think I am talking to a disorder and not the person underneath.",0,1731936859.0,Adulting,4,0.5,False

**1. Pick a Niche You Actually Care About**

* If you don’t love your topic, your audience won’t either.
* Tip: Think of it as a long-term relationship. Are you ready to commit to talking about it for years?

 

**2. Make Killer Content (Not Literal, Please)**

* Quality matters more than quantity, but posting consistently is also the key.
* Tip: People click for curiosity but stay for value—entertain, educate, or inspire. If you can do all three, you’ve hit gold.

 

**3. Hook ‘Em in the First 10 Seconds**

* Start with something attention-grabbing—ask a provocative question, make a bold statement, or show something unexpected.
* Tip: Think of your intro as a movie trailer. If it’s boring, no one’s sticking around for the ""main feature.""

 

**4. Master Thumbnails and Titles**

* Your thumbnail is your first impression; make it impossible to ignore.
* Tip: Use bold text, bright colors, and make it clickable but not clickbait. If your title promises “10 Tips,” deliver at least 10 (and make them good).

 

**5. Understand SEO (Yes, It’s Important)**

* Use keywords in your title, description, and tags to help people find your videos.
* Tip: Think like a viewer. What would *you* search to find your video? No one’s typing “Random Video #3” unless you’re famous.

 

**6. Keep Videos Snappy**

* Attention spans are short. Edit ruthlessly—cut out the boring bits.
* Tip: If you think, “Is this part too long?” the answer is probably yes.

 

**7. Encourage Engagement**

* Ask your viewers questions, prompt them to comment, and always remind them to like, subscribe, and hit that bell (but not too desperately).
* Tip: Pretend you’re hosting a party—make people feel involved, not like they’re watching you talk to yourself.

 

**8. Ride Trends, But Make Them Yours**

* Hop on viral challenges, trending topics, or seasonal content, but give it your unique spin.
* Tip: Don’t be a copycat. If everyone’s making cake, bring the frosting.

 

**9. Collaborate Like a Pro**

* Partner with creators in your niche to tap into each other’s audiences.
* Tip: Pick collabs wisely. Teaming up with someone who makes knitting tutorials while you do gaming might confuse everyone.

 

**10. Invest in Basic Equipment**

* Decent audio and lighting make a huge difference. Even a budget-friendly mic and ring light can elevate your videos.
* Tip: You can film on your phone, but no one forgives bad sound. If your video sounds like it was recorded inside a washing machine, you’re in trouble.

 

**11. Analyze and Adapt**

* Tip: If a video flops, it’s not the end. Treat it like a science experiment. Adjust, retry, and maybe don’t upload that “How to make coffee” tutorial again.

1gu4qix,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1gu4qix/5_years_old_problems/,5 years old problems,"We have a 5-year-old son, and he’s such a lovely boy—warm and kind. However, over the past couple of months, I’ve noticed a change in his behavior. If he wants something and doesn’t get it, he’ll throw a massive tantrum—kicking, scratching, and generally losing control until he calms down. I usually try to stay calm and work things out with him, but sometimes things spiral out of control. He’ll start pulling my hair, kicking, and throwing anything he can get his hands on. I’ve tried staying calm, but it doesn’t work. Shouting at him doesn’t help either.

The other day, we were at a coffee shop, and he asked to go to soft play. When I said no, he kicked the chairs, spilled my coffee, and had such a meltdown that my husband had to take him outside. But it didn’t end there—it carried on in the car, with him kicking, shouting, and screaming for at least 30 minutes. It’s utterly exhausting and draining.

My husband usually starts off calm with him, but when our son doesn’t calm down, he ends up shouting, which only makes things worse. I try to mediate and calm them both, but it’s so exhausting trying to keep my husband and my son calm at the same time. I’ve spoken to my husband about staying calm but firm, but he sometimes gets so frustrated that he’ll cry in front of our son, which doesn’t work either and feels a bit immature. Every time there’s a fight, I feel like I have to step in because otherwise, they’re at it like two kids. Then my husband blames me for being too soft with our son, which I’m not—I just avoid shouting because it escalates things. That said, I’ll occasionally raise my voice when I’ve reached my limit, but only as a last resort.

This is a new phase, and we’ve never dealt with this kind of behavior before. I feel completely lost.

When I drop my son off at school, he’ll insist that I pick him up. If I say I can’t, he’ll sit down and refuse to move or run off. On days when I don’t pick him up, he’ll find other ways to push boundaries—walking in the middle of busy paths, moving too slowly, or running after pigeons. Every time I drop him off, I feel like people are staring at us for one reason or another.

I thought I was doing everything right—giving him healthy food, limiting screen time (he barely uses the iPad or phone), letting him watch TV in moderation, and keeping him active with cycling, swimming, and outdoor activities, bed time routines. But now, I feel like I’m failing as a mother. My marriage feels like it’s falling apart because we’re constantly fighting over one thing or another.

The other day, my son had croup, so we had to take him to the hospital at 1 a.m. When we got home, he refused to go to bed, and the situation carried on until 4 a.m. (We co sleep, I mean usually when our wake himself up at some point at night and will come into our bedroom.)I asked my husband if he could sleep in a different room so he could get some rest, and we could take turns with our son. But he refused, saying that he shouldn’t have to move and that our son needed to be “disciplined.” At that point, I’d had enough, and I ended up shouting at my husband in front of our son. My husband eventually left the room, and as soon as he did, our son fell asleep.

I just feel so exhausted—I don’t know what to do anymore. It feels like I’m in some sort of Russian prison, sleep-deprived and worn down.",3,1731936666.0,Parenting,5,1.0,False

1gu4pep,https://www.reddit.com/r/tipping/comments/1gu4pep/eden_roc_miami_putting_tips_on_everything/,Eden Roc Miami putting tips on everything ,"Edited to fix flair. I tried including receipt pics but got an error message that this sub doesn't support pics. 

I'm in Miami for work, got here last night and meet a client at the beachfront bar called Ocean Social. We sat at the bar because he wanted to watch the NFL game but the TVs didn't work. 

Bartender was nice but not good. He got my drink wrong (gave me vodka & tonic even though I ordered a soda) and gave me a look when I asked him to remake it. He forgot to put our order in at first so the food took almost an hour to come out. For some reason it came boxed to go, and instead of having the kitchen fix it he handed us a couple of side plates and we had to plate it ourselves. This also meant our flatbread appetizer came at the same time as dinner. 

I got the bill and it seemed really high even for Miami Beach - $226 for an app, two entrees, a side and 4 drinks. And there it was - a 22% Service Fee. For a group of two, sitting at the bar. That was $37, plus we were taxed on it. I wrote $0.00 in the tip section, and then drew an arrow from the tip line to the service line, just in case anyone curious.

This morning I went downstairs to get breakfast. Bill for a cup of plain drip coffee, and a Grab & Go yogurt parfait, came to almost $25. This time the barista didn't even give me the itemized receipt, instead she handing me the credit card form with tip lines while literally crumpling up the itemized one. I told her I need the itemized one for expensing it and asked her to reprint it, and guess what? 20% service fees on there. Once again I tipped $0.00 and circled the service fee.

* If you don’t love your topic, your audience won’t either.
* Tip: Think of it as a long-term relationship. Are you ready to commit to talking about it for years?

 

**2. Make Killer Content (Not Literal, Please)**

* Quality matters more than quantity, but posting consistently is also the key.
* Tip: People click for curiosity but stay for value—entertain, educate, or inspire. If you can do all three, you’ve hit gold.

 

**3. Hook ‘Em in the First 10 Seconds**

* Start with something attention-grabbing—ask a provocative question, make a bold statement, or show something unexpected.
* Tip: Think of your intro as a movie trailer. If it’s boring, no one’s sticking around for the ""main feature.""

 

**4. Master Thumbnails and Titles**

* Your thumbnail is your first impression; make it impossible to ignore.
* Tip: Use bold text, bright colors, and make it clickable but not clickbait. If your title promises “10 Tips,” deliver at least 10 (and make them good).

 

**5. Understand SEO (Yes, It’s Important)**

* Use keywords in your title, description, and tags to help people find your videos.
* Tip: Think like a viewer. What would *you* search to find your video? No one’s typing “Random Video #3” unless you’re famous.

 

**6. Keep Videos Snappy**

* Attention spans are short. Edit ruthlessly—cut out the boring bits.
* Tip: If you think, “Is this part too long?” the answer is probably yes.

 

**7. Encourage Engagement**

* Ask your viewers questions, prompt them to comment, and always remind them to like, subscribe, and hit that bell (but not too desperately).
* Tip: Pretend you’re hosting a party—make people feel involved, not like they’re watching you talk to yourself.

 

**8. Ride Trends, But Make Them Yours**

* Hop on viral challenges, trending topics, or seasonal content, but give it your unique spin.
* Tip: Don’t be a copycat. If everyone’s making cake, bring the frosting.

 

**9. Collaborate Like a Pro**

* Partner with creators in your niche to tap into each other’s audiences.
* Tip: Pick collabs wisely. Teaming up with someone who makes knitting tutorials while you do gaming might confuse everyone.

 

**10. Invest in Basic Equipment**

* Decent audio and lighting make a huge difference. Even a budget-friendly mic and ring light can elevate your videos.
* Tip: You can film on your phone, but no one forgives bad sound. If your video sounds like it was recorded inside a washing machine, you’re in trouble.

 

**11. Analyze and Adapt**

* Check your YouTube Analytics to see what’s working (and what’s not).
* Tip: If a video flops, it’s not the end. Treat it like a science experiment. Adjust, retry, and maybe don’t upload that “How to make coffee” tutorial again.

 

**12. Build a Community**

I’m with the love of my life now, we’re much more compatible, but I find myself thinking about the good times I had… with my ex’s mom.

She and I were basically the same person. Same hobbies, same work ethic, same outlook on life. We even have the same laugh which we discovered during the first meet-the-family dinner and it put everyone in hysterics laughing. As a “boy mom”, I was like the daughter she never had. My favourite part of my visits to his family’s house was getting up early to drink coffee and do jigsaw puzzles with her while waiting for my ex to wake up. I could talk to her about anything. I came out to her about being autistic and she didn’t condescend to me at all about it, while meanwhile when I mentioned it to my ex he would just pretend I didn’t say anything (which was ironic as he was such a rigid thinker he definitely is on the spectrum as well). Especially near the end of the relationship, I felt more connected to his family than I did to him.

My soon-to-be MIL is a lovely woman. We don’t really have any hobbies in common, but we are cordial. She thought I was weird at first but I’ve gotten into her good graces by cleaning up after family gatherings and making her son happy. But I miss the kinship I had with my ex’s mom. This time of year always has me feeling blue and nostalgic about stuff, but every time I think of my ex’s mom I feel actual loss that she’s not in my life anymore.",8,1731936297.0,TrueOffMyChest,1,1.0,False

Since the beginning his messages weren’t really long, mostly to plan dates. Our first date was coffee where we had nice time, he walked me home, and it ended in handshake. He then messaged me saying he had good time, and would like us to meet again.
Second date was similar, but I was extremely nervous, because I didn’t date in a really long time. It ended with a hug where I, due to my anxiety of the expectations almost ran away (it was short hug). He messaged me after that, with something related to what we talked about.

I initiated 3rd date, mentioned I was a bit nervous last time we met, explained this, and we had great time where we talked for 4 hours, and took a long walk home together. I wanted him to kiss me, but I’m worried that I didn’t show enough interest. Again, he hugged me, but nothing happened. He messaged again sending something date related. Few days passed, we didn’t talk. I texted him, but it was really short reply. I think he lost interest…

1gu4lq4,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Read_an_ice_age_saga/comments/1gu4lq4/theres_an_old_saying_when_you_buy_fish_you_buy/,"There's an old saying: ""When you buy fish, you buy men's lives""...","https://preview.redd.it/nkiubl6kvn1e1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0c8731eb948cdfcb1055ae25b4232710ef73f8b1

There’s an old saying: “When you buy fish, you buy men’s lives.” While modern technology has made the commercial fishing industry far safer than it was in past centuries—or even millennia—the occupation still comes with inherent risks. Some leave shore, never to touch land again.

When I was growing up, my dad was a commercial fisherman, a sea scalloper. I’ll never forget the time we went out fishing just after another boat had gone down, taking all hands with it. A sea scalloper tows a drag along the ocean floor, scooping up scallops and a certain amount of bycatch—flounder, crabs, lobsters, starfish, sea urchins, and sometimes other things: a coffee mug, a soda can, a single glove or boot, or fragments of clothing. After a tragedy at sea, those personal articles seemed like haunting reminders. They likely didn’t come from the doomed boat, but they were a sober reminder of what can happen.

Most of the time, though, there was little to alarm us. The only time I remember being concerned was on a sunny afternoon when we were towing the drag, as usual. I was standing at the shucking box, my hands moving automatically in a rhythm acquired after years spent at the task. Without warning, the boat jerked to a stop as the drag snagged something deep underwater. The engine kept chugging along, trying to propel us forward and causing the deck to lurch and tilt beneath my feet.

Dad sprang into action. In a flash, he flung himself across the steadily steepening deck to the winch, in order to pay out enough cable to prevent the boat from capsizing. It was over just as quickly as it had begun and the deck now leveled-out, but I knew how close we’d come to disaster. If not for his quick thinking, we might have been left dog-paddling for our lives.

Twelve years ago, another sea scalloper wasn’t so fortunate. The Captain, Jean Frottier, lost his life in a similar mishap. I knew him—it was a sad ending for a lively and funny guy. I cannot say if his love of the sea was strong enough that it was the way he'd have wanted to go, but for some, that is surely true. 

This post is a tribute to Jean and to all who make their living in nature, by land or by sea, as our ancestors once did. Like the characters in my books, they faced the elements and wild beasts to provide for their families. It is because of their courage and perseverance that we’re still here today.

“This year, we’re not just spreading joy; we’re making it ripple like the waves,” 🏖️🦞 said, her claws clicking with determination. The elves, inspired by their cheerful leader, took this to heart.

So let me start:-**  

**1. Pick a Niche You Actually Care About**

* If you don’t love your topic, your audience won’t either.
* Tip: Think of it as a long-term relationship. Are you ready to commit to talking about it for years?

 

**2. Make Killer Content (Not Literal, Please)**

* Quality matters more than quantity, but posting consistently is also the key.
* Tip: People click for curiosity but stay for value—entertain, educate, or inspire. If you can do all three, you’ve hit gold.

 

**3. Hook ‘Em in the First 10 Seconds**

* Start with something attention-grabbing—ask a provocative question, make a bold statement, or show something unexpected.
* Tip: Think of your intro as a movie trailer. If it’s boring, no one’s sticking around for the ""main feature.""

 

**4. Master Thumbnails and Titles**

* Your thumbnail is your first impression; make it impossible to ignore.
* Tip: Use bold text, bright colors, and make it clickable but not clickbait. If your title promises “10 Tips,” deliver at least 10 (and make them good).

 

**5. Understand SEO (Yes, It’s Important)**

* Use keywords in your title, description, and tags to help people find your videos.
* Tip: Think like a viewer. What would *you* search to find your video? No one’s typing “Random Video #3” unless you’re famous.

 

**6. Keep Videos Snappy**

* Attention spans are short. Edit ruthlessly—cut out the boring bits.
* Tip: If you think, “Is this part too long?” the answer is probably yes.

 

**7. Encourage Engagement**

* Ask your viewers questions, prompt them to comment, and always remind them to like, subscribe, and hit that bell (but not too desperately).
* Tip: Pretend you’re hosting a party—make people feel involved, not like they’re watching you talk to yourself.

 

**8. Ride Trends, But Make Them Yours**

* Hop on viral challenges, trending topics, or seasonal content, but give it your unique spin.
* Tip: Don’t be a copycat. If everyone’s making cake, bring the frosting.

 

**9. Collaborate Like a Pro**

* Partner with creators in your niche to tap into each other’s audiences.
* Tip: Pick collabs wisely. Teaming up with someone who makes knitting tutorials while you do gaming might confuse everyone.

 

**10. Invest in Basic Equipment**

* Decent audio and lighting make a huge difference. Even a budget-friendly mic and ring light can elevate your videos.
* Tip: You can film on your phone, but no one forgives bad sound. If your video sounds like it was recorded inside a washing machine, you’re in trouble.

 

**11. Analyze and Adapt**

* Check your YouTube Analytics to see what’s working (and what’s not).
* Tip: If a video flops, it’s not the end. Treat it like a science experiment. Adjust, retry, and maybe don’t upload that “How to make coffee” tutorial again.

 

**12. Build a Community**

* Engage with your viewers. Reply to comments, even the weird ones.
* Tip: Remember, every subscriber is a person who chose *your* channel over millions of others. That’s special (even if they only commented, “First!”).

 

**13. Be Patient and Persistent**

* Success doesn’t happen overnight. Even the biggest creators started with zero subscribers.
* Tip: Treat YouTube like a marathon, not a sprint. Unless you're PewDiePie’s twin, you’re not going viral on day one.

 

**14. Have Fun!**

* Viewers can tell when you’re enjoying yourself.
* Tip: If you’re having a blast, it’ll shine through your videos—and people love positive energy.

I guess this would do the trick.

1gu4efg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Studium/comments/1gu4efg/iu_soziale_arbeit_ba/,IU - Soziale Arbeit B.A.,"Guten Tag,

als kurzes Vorwort möchte ich meine aktuelle Lebenssituation erklären und wieso ich (ursprünglich / immer noch(?)) geplant habe Soziale Arbeit (B.A.) an der IU zu studieren.   
Ich bin Vollzeit-Boomer (mit 35 Jahren), 40h Woche, Tätig in einer Leitungsposition einer pädagogischen Jugendhilfeeinrichtung , verheiratet und zwei Kindern (Grundschule). Soweit so stundenfüllend.

Da ich mittelfristig (Zeitraum von ca. 8 Jahren) die Gesamtleitung übernehmen soll, hat mein Geschäftsführer mir angeraten noch einen Akademischen Grad ""draufzusetzen"", dies hat verschiedene Gründe und spielen für die eigentliche Fragestellung keine Rolle. 

Einige Kollegen/innen studierten und studieren gerade an der IU und diese haben mir diese Fernuni empfolen. Ich hab mich da eingelesen, viel gutes und, besonders hier, im Sup viel negatives gelesen, soweit ist mein Blick ziemlich klar auf die IU (dacht ich bisher zumindest), besonders da ich nicht architektur studieren will. ;)

Ich habe mich für das Teilzeit-Modul (48 Monate) entschieden da meine Ressourcen durch meine atuelle Situation begrenzt sind. Zudem wurden mir 35 ECTS auf Grund meiner Ausbildung bereits anerkannt. Das ich alles, inkl. Prüfungen online machen kann, fand ich super. 

Nun hat einer meiner oben genannten Kollegen, welcher sein Studium an der IU absolvierte seine ""Urkunde"" erhalten und ich war etwas baff. Das ""Teil"" hätte ich mir im Coffee-Shop nebenan selbst drucken können. Ich weiß jetzt nicht ob da noch was offizelles kommt, aber allein die ""Urkunde"" macht einen sehr schäbigen Eindruck. Wir haben diese Stück Papier mit anderen Urkunden verglichen. Keine Angabe von den absolvierten ECTS, keine Noten, keine Angaben, dass der akademische Grad geführt werden darf. Etc etc. Ich denke ihr wisst was ich meine. 

Wir müssen nun erstmal prüfen, ob dieses Stück Papier der Heimaufsicht ausreicht oder ob es da Probleme mit der letztlichen Anerkennung gibt. 

Ich bin gerade echt am überlegen ob meine Wahl, unabhägig der Vorteile, die richtige Entscheidung war. 

Falls hier jemand bei der IU seinen B.A. gemacht hat, vielleicht auch in Sozialer Arbeit, wäre ich dankbar für jeden Erfahrungsbericht - besonders im Zusammenhang mit der Anerkennung. 



Danke und schönen Wochenstart an alle.

""Alpha males"" and PUAs are now parodied, everyone is now aware of all the tenets of dating and relationships. It feels like we are getting closer to the culmination of history's progress with the relations between men and women.

  
With this it all feels collectively that women have been through all the motions and have had all the relationships - some casual, some long-term. The average western woman has seen it all. Good men, bad men, men who didn't turn her on, men who did and then treated her badly, or she got bored, or something else, and now by the time she's around 30-32 she's now voluntarily single, and very independent (nothing wrong with that at all, just observations). Women are just as happy going on coffee dates with their besties, I'm also seeing a lot of young girls out with their PARENTS - it's not un-cool or unfashionable anymore to involve your parents in things. And not to mention people feel tired in general with the effort and energy involved in managing relationships.

  
Then you have the whole 4B thing which I know is mostly hyperbole, but there is some truth to it in that a lot of women really just don't date anymore, for all sorts of reasons. They've been there, done that. What do you think?

I paid off the CCs a while back, the final debt I had was my student loan which I just paid in full. It's a great feeling being done with paying interest. I still have a lot more milestones to hit. Now that I can actually save money the new milestones are opening up a HYSA and starting an emergency fund in it, then begin investing again. Long term goals are to complete training programs that my job pays for that will help me earn a higher salary.

The last 3 years all of my spendable money went straight towards my debts. I was paying them down aggressively. I made coffee at home every day, packed lunch at home almost daily, sold my car, I cut my bills by switching to cheaper alternatives, have 0 subscriptions and leveraged my CCs to help me out. 

Using CCs is not the problem, being unaware of how they work is. I use my CCs to get rewards back for stuff I need to buy anyway and I buy in bulk to keep costs low while shopping around to get the best prices. In the last year I got $183 back in rewards just for using my Amazon CC for example. 

Every single dollar saved is a dollar earned and without a plan in place that actually makes sense you can never expect next year to be better than this year. I don't say this to be pessimistic: Life isn't going to magically workout for you just because in your mind youre the main character. You won't be getting plot armor just because you are you. It is 100% possible to miss out on all the dreams you had if you dont plan and work for them when you have the time to do so.

She canceled at the last moment because she lost her apartment keys (I was nice and understanding about it and offered to help in finding a locksmith or bringing any tools)

Last Tuesday: When I was on my way to the bar, she texted she would be 20 minutes late. I said that I hope she is not very late. She tried to hurry up and was only 5 minutes late. The date went smoothly, but the conversation was okayish for me.

Her text communication was not very good in general. She would sometimes ignore some of my messages. She didn't even have a profile picture on WhatsApp (maybe she didn't save my contact)

I grew up in a constantly tense environment on weekends, whenever my father was at home. My father didn’t respect my mother: he would constantly invite his family over without consulting her beforehand. She would come home on Saturday evening, exhausted, and have to clean up after them. She didn’t let herself be pushed around, but even so, I always saw her preparing his tray so he could eat in front of the TV, drink his coffee, and then clear everything once he was gone, leaving things as they were, without ever complaining.

She did his laundry, cleaned up after him when he came in with muddy shoes, or when he dropped ashes on the floor. When I pointed out that he had made a mess, he would shoot me a look and ignore my comment. She also prepared his lunchboxes for the first four days of the week before he retired. Never once did I hear him say thank you or please.

Even today, when he stops by the house, it’s just to have a coffee, take his medication, and rummage around as if he’s looking for something, money maybe? The atmosphere is still tense and stressful. Two weeks ago, I asked him not to go upstairs with his shoes on. He ignored me, so I followed him to at least protect the carpets (a nightmare to clean up.) In two seconds, he became aggressive, not physically, but with insidious threats.

I think I understood who he was when I heard him insult my mother behind her back when I was 7 or 8 years old. Now, he does it directly in front of her. He never really tried to build a relationship with me. I remember always chasing after him, accompanying him as he spent his days going from one relative’s house to another. Then, I just didn’t want to go anymore, and I never spent time with him again. I remember the only time he was physically violent. He slapped my mom, and I jumped on his back to stop him from hurting her. He pushed me away, I fell onto the ironing board, and the iron fell on me (cold). He left and never spoke of it again, as if it never happened, i was 11 years old.

Today, he’s a stranger, no different than the baker I’ve seen for over 20 years. I feel sadness for the relationship he could have built, indifference towards his fate, and anger at all the lack of recognition, appreciation, and respect. It’s impossible to build a relationship with someone who simply doesn’t want one. Even though he loudly claims that his family is the most important thing to him, I’ve come to understand that, to him, we, his children, were not part of it. It’s his siblings that matter to him.

Now that he’s retired, it’s like this every day: he comes over, stresses us out, brings down our morale, and then leaves to spend time with who knows who. I’m relieved he no longer sleeps here and that we can have calm evenings. I wish he would disappear from my life as soon as possible so I can stop living in constant tension, stop feeling the knot in my stomach, stop having to adapt to his emotions, and, most of all, never see him again.

The two most accurate situations where the following:

We've been working on setting up our Coffee Shop / Bookstore since March.  After two soft openings where we learned a lot, we are fully open this Saturday.  Some things we've been conscious of include:

1. PAY - We pay well and tips distribute automatically without our touching them.  Barista's are responsible for dividing cash tips when anyone leaves a shift.  Pay is transparent and people are welcome to discuss it openly.
2. MANAGEMENT - What management?  Beyond the owners, we're flat.  Everyone is a Bookstore Barista, empowered to make decisions up to a $ amount and act for themselves.  As we've brought people on for training and the soft openings, it's been sobering to watch people think they need to ask me about the smallest of things.  My response has consistently been, ""You're smart, you can figure it out without me.""
3. BENEFITS - While many of our Baristas are part-time (students), some have asked for full-time hours and for those we are working up benefits for those that need them.  In my mind our people help create the atmosphere we want, so why would we not try to treat them well?  You know, besides them also being people...
4. NOT ALONE - We have a policy for never having anyone be alone, so we always have a minimum of 2 people with 3 for the busy times.
5. LINENS - We pay for a linen service that also takes care of the cushion mats behind the counter, clothes, soap, paper products etc.  No need to take things home to wash or try to wash mats outside.  I once watched a very petite person struggling with large mats behind a coffee shop and it left an impression.
6. LOCKERS & SHOE ALLOWANCE - We will buy our employees shoes they can keep in a locker at work instead of having their shoes wear out.  Everyone also gets a dedicated lockers that is theirs.  If they don't have a lock, we'll provide one for them.
7. BREAKS - We provide a paid break per 4 hours as well as a lunch for longer shifts.  Drink all the coffee you want and one canned drink and food item per shift.  We also have people take home what they may want before it expires.
8. YOU ARE HUMAN - It's how we see our people.  We ask for their opinions and suggestions.  Some of our best ideas have come from the same.

There's a lot more, but we want our coffee not to just be good; we want our cafe/bookstore to be enjoyable not just for those that are paying, but for those that are working.  I've been impressed with how our baristas handle pressure and appreciate their work.  I feel the best way to express that is monetarily and by the work environment we provide.

I hate having to write such a negative post but after my experience I thought that it could come useful for the ones who might be thinking of ordering from them, since they are quite known here.

I ordered their Filter Advent Calendar on the 7th of November, choosing for my coffee to be shipped from the 15th onward, to get the freshest batch. I also chose the more expensive FedEx Express shipping, leaving a note asking if they could send the coffee even a bit later, since it would have managed to arrive on time easily.

The next day I got an email that the FedEx tracking had been created.
I contacted their customer support, who replied:

> thanks so much for reaching out - You will receive the last roast, of course. But we are a small team and in order to fulfil all orders in time, we like to have a little buffer ;)

I did not, in fact, receive their last roast.

The coffee arrived here on the 14th.  
I contacted their CS again - first to request an explanation when I got the notification that the package had been shipped, and then to let them know, politely, my disappointment when it had arrived - but got no reply to either email.

Finally, the cherry on top: the package has no roasting date information, only the expiry date. This for me is a hard no when it comes to specialty coffee.   
I realise that the coffee has been roasted on different days, but in that case it would be totally acceptable to indicate the range (e.g.: ""All coffee roasted between 01/11 and 05/11"").  
The missing roasting date just makes me think it's been roasted quite in advance and it will be pretty old at the end of December.

Overall a completely disappointing experience: I understand if they would not have managed to ship the coffee later as I had requested, but why offer the option to ship it at a later date, and then ignore the selection? Even worse, their CS straight up lied and then ignored the followup messages. And finally, the missing roasting date, meaning it is most definitely not freshly roasted.

So please, in case you decide to order from them, just be aware that this is how they operate.

From my end, this is the first and only order from them.

Thanks for reading and again, sorry for the negative post, but I really want to warn any potential buyer - also considering that the calendar with shipping comes up to over €100.

PS: Funny enough I had decided to order from 19grams and not from Kaffeebox as I had recently ordered from KB and they had ""forgotten"" my order: when they realised it, they shipped the coffee, but at that point when it arrived it was already a few weeks old. Guess that's just my luck with coffee.",3,1731934396.0,pourover,5,1.0,False

[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/wygr3l/bridgebuilder_in_the_unknown/) | [Prev](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1gpjqpu/bridgebuilder_chapter_113/)

The meeting was strikingly boring. Colonel Lehnan was the lead on the Tsla’o side - officially at least - and Admiral Serrat was his counterpart for this operation. Not much new information had come about in the last ten days or so. Everybody had thrown all the normal sensors and less-destructive testing at the portal ring sitting a few dozen astronomical units above the north pole of Sol, and even the more experimental things they’d tried had yielded basically nothing new about it.

Serrat proposed setting up a forward base in the ‘parking garage’ the *Kshlav’o* had been landed in, in preparation for moving into the artifact itself. This would require a detachment of Tsla’o personnel, as the ring only activated the portal when approached by a mixed crew. Initial testing indicated that it didn’t care how the group left, but if there was just one race left inside it'd close again. There were guesses about this behavior, most of which pointed towards some sort of intelligence setting these parameters. Not one that was Human or Tsla'o, obviously. The money was on some kind of AI, or VI, or thinking machine, as there was currently no indication of a living space as anyone at the table could define it.

The Empire had planned for this next step, as it had come up as a possibility at the last meeting. There was a group ready to go, a mix of military and scientists, many of whom had at least *some* experience working with Humans. Both personnel and vehicles would be placed at their disposal. 

The ramp up was going to be a bit over a month. Everyone was happy with that. Carbon would do her thing with the new class of Lan - and also hopefully pound some sense into her father - and as Alex was really only needed once they actually returned to the artifact itself, they didn’t seem to mind if he went along. Enhance cooperation and cultural exchange between allies. Admiral Argueta seemed particularly pleased with that.

The reception after the meeting? Argueta was less pleased with that. It went smoothly, several diplomats from various Confed states and organizations had come out to meet the Empress. Eleya was at maximum schmooze, putting on a friendly, sociable attitude. She apparently recognized a few names and made it a point to thank them for all of the assistance rendered. The Empress even had jokes. She appeared to be having a good time, but that could easily have been part of the front. 

Argueta’s problem was that Alex gravitated towards her - she was his boss, after all - and he would not shut up about novel Tsla’o minutia he had learned. Insufferable, boring facts. She had excused herself about halfway through his explainer on how most homes and restaurants had three spices on the table, but they were usually liquid. One was sweet, one salty, and the other a spicy vinegar. It reminded him of a very basic hot sauce. There were other spices around of course, and sometimes certain sauces were... Well. It was all in his second report!

Alex was a little disappointed to find out that Gladwell hadn’t been invited. Diplomatic Security nixed him. He had a whole bit about bathroom design for the Commander, but apparently that wasn’t in the cards.

On the up side, the snacks - hors d’oeuvres, actually - were fantastic. Canapés and other stuff that he didn't know enough French to name. Very fancy. Didn't care for the champagne though. Always tasted weird to him if it wasn’t mixed with something.

He was able to rope one of the Diplomatic Security Service guys into getting him a sufficiently secure dining room. Mister Santos was actually very happy to help. Best part? There was one actually attached to Noonan’s. Kind of. All the restaurants on the station - even the kitschy Roswell crash site themed diner - had a secure dining and meeting room. That feature had been in the plans before they had finalized what was going where.

It was a bit of a letdown, apparently. The theme didn’t carry over at all, save for some potted cacti they usually had to remove because of the spikes.

Once again feeling at ease in his natural environment - apparently a subdued ballroom that was about 50% security personnel - Alex had forgotten one particularly important thing: making sure everyone was actually on board with this. He didn’t even know if Ed was on the station.

He flagged down Carbon first, peeling her away from Williams and Zenshen for a brief conversation. She was a little hesitant to include Eleya, understandably, but game to go along with it to hang out with his friends and family some more. 

Alex excused himself and started making calls in the hallway.

It was really weird to be calling his mom in front of a dozen security guards. It made him feel like he was in trouble or something just because they were all standing around watching him. Even dipping around the corner didn't help. There were more guys there.

His mom was glad to hear from him. Had a lovely time with Carbon and her security folks. She joked that she would need to clear her calendar this evening to make time for it, but would love to come along. He’d text her the location details when he had them. It was nice to talk to her again, even if they were intentionally avoiding some things. 

Eventually the time would come where they wouldn’t have to pretend that Carbon was just a good friend of his who wanted to know more about Humanity. There was a lot of unknowns in there for him and unease seeped into his heart as he hung up the call. For the most part, everyone had been accepting of them. There were a few outliers, sure, and no way to know who was just holding their tongue because the Empress loomed over his shoulder for the moment.

Gladwell’s reaction, and the way Pete’s wife sort of clammed up at dinner stuck in his mind as well. He had known this would be uphill, and had told Carbon as much when they came back to Sol. They had a start. 

Alex shoveled as much of that out of his mind as he could and dug up Ed’s number. 

It rang twice before he picked up. “Hey Alex, how’s the GX?”

“Doing g-” Ed’s question caught up with him. “How?”

He laughed, hearty and friendly as always. “You’re on the news, unnamed Navy pilot.”

Fuck. “Oh, fuck. How *bad* on the news?” People who worked for the Civilian Pilot Program tended to split news reports into either good or bad. There was no inbetween for them. At least he was unnamed for the moment.

“Good, I’d say. Not doing a lot of traffic as far as I can see - it’s a novelty for people who want to see aliens more than anything, you’re just standing in the background. Lots of folks in the dugout recognized you though. It has raised some eyebrows about that ONI transfer. Unrelated, thank you for reaching out promptly this time.”

The dugout was the informal term for the training decks. All the briefing rooms and simulators were there, and where the trainers like Ed had their offices. New pilots and those waiting for a redeployment spent a lot of time in the dugout. At least he was well recognized and apparently his involvement elsewhere wasn’t enough to make the news bad. “I’ll take it. I actually wanted to know if you were interested in grabbing dinner tonight. Carbon and my mom are here, and Eleya.”

“Who?”

Alex took the shot. “My mom, the woman who gave birth to me and raised me?”

“I know what a mom is, jackass. Who’s Eleya?” He was annoyed but still laughing about it.

“The Empress of the Tsla’o Empire.”

The connection got very quiet for a good ten seconds. “Are you fucking with me? Hey Ed, you want to catch up over dinner? By the by, the Royal Sovereign of an alien race is going to be there, too.”

“Nope, I am completely serious.” He was. Yes, Ed was unaware of the new familial ties, which probably would have made this seem less completely out of left field. Admittedly, he wasn’t even sure it was a good idea. “She’s an interesting character. Fairly down to earth despite the whole royalty thing. I think she could stand to be around more people who are not deeply harmed by the cataclysm, too.”

Well, slightly down to earth. Now that he’d had time to get to know her. She had been acting more personable lately in general.

“You don’t have to convince me, I’m just making sure you’re not putting me on. So where are you guys going, The Mothership?” He chuckled. 

“Man, I thought about it. Carbon knows somebody there, I guess, but I got one of the DSS guys to reserve the executive dining room by Noonan’s. The decor there should actually translate to their sensibilities pretty well.” Also he was not hyped about any of the restaurants on the station except for Noonan’s. Maybe the coffee shop, their ice cream is top notch.

Ed was surprised by that. “I didn’t know Noonan’s had one of those. Since DSS is involved, have them send me the details and they can get working on my background check.” 

“Alright, will do.” He hadn’t realized that DSS was going to require further information for things like security checks. Santos asking him for a list of people who were coming made a lot more sense now.

He got Santos the list. Really only Ed and his mother, as all the Tsla’o were already cleared. Everyone would be escorted over at five PM station time, which wasn’t too far away, and exactly when the 

In the mean time, he joined up with Carbon again. Met a government official from Arvaikheer II, which was the last Human settlement of good size before the Tsla’o Empire’s borders and had become the gateway for trade in and out of their territory. It was still a long trip in a hauler, apparently, but that’s the tradeoff for pushing cargo. Physics could be bent, but not broken entirely.

Arvaikheer also had the largest community of Tsla’o in Human space, who were in a very weird position. Refugees for the moment, but while the Empire was growing its livable space as fast as it could, it was also constantly bringing more people off the surface of Schoen, so they likely would not be able to return to their homelands for years. If they decided they wanted to stay and join the Confederation, that may actually be impossible. The Confed simply didn’t have any immigration laws. The entirety of Human space was inside the Confederation and all the aliens had kept their distance, at best, so there had been nowhere to emigrate *from* for the last century. 

It had come up, but bureaucracy was slow moving on a good day and a couple of hundred aliens in a bind at the edge of Human space was not something that people eagerly crafted legislation about.

Leaving the Empire was equally as problematic as the Empire didn’t currently allow relinquishing citizenship. That was a punishment, and they would not consider banishing citizens without good reason. They also didn’t recognize dual citizenship, which was kind of news to Alex. What the hell did that make him?

That question could wait. He wasn’t exactly a refugee at this moment, but he did know who needed to be looped into this conversation. It only took him a few moments to locate Eleya, who seemed to be a little bored by whoever she was talking to, some guy dressed like he was in a James Bond film.

He had the feeling he was about to make Mr. Gantulga’s week, given how passionate he was about doing right by these refugees, as he flagged Eleya down. She disengaged from the dude she was talking to as quickly as possible. An introduction later the Empress was fully engaged in this discussion, the gears behind her eyes turning as she got to dip into a problem that she might actually be able to do something about.

While they talked, he got to peel Carbon off and chat for a while before Santos and a couple of DSS suits pulled up to collect everyone.

Before they left, Eleya dispatched Sergeant Zenshen get Mr. Gantulga’s contact information and more details about how the Tsla’o had gotten to his planet. The fact that refugees had made it to Confederation space was news to her, and making sure that things were being handled as clearly as possible was a priority.

Having never really left the CPP section of McFadden, Alex was actually unaware of just how big ‘third largest station’ in Sol was. Everything he had dealt with was tightly siloed, and thus he had never really walked around much. So the thirty minutes of travel by foot to the executive dining suite was a surprise. Yeah there was a ride on a lift, and several security doors, but the amount of walking was unexpected. 

Ed and Audry were already seated. They had earpieces in as well, DSS really putting in legwork here that he had not really thought about. 

“Hey, mom.” He hugged his mom first, of course. Priorities. It felt like it had been months since he’d seen his parents last, and it hadn’t even been two weeks yet. Plus, everyone there would have never stopped giving him shit about it if he said hello to Ed first, and Ed would have been the first one to start.

“Alex, it’s so good to see you again.” She hugged with the force of someone twice her size, squeezing the breath out of him.

“Good to see you too.” He said after he’d caught his breath. “Ah, hang on, introductions. Most of you know each other already but let me run it down.”

He went around the little group, Ed, Audry, Carbon, Eleya. They had left most of the security team in the antechamber, DSS putting a pair of Tsla’o security in the service staging area as well, so he didn’t have to worry about his mom making them part of the family this time.

His mom bowed to Eleya. A little more than necessary, if he was being honest.

“Please, do not bow so deeply.” Eleya gestured for her to stand, apparently agreeing with Alex’s estimation of how far she should be bowing. “Your son has proven to be a tremendous ally to the Tsla’o people, and more honorable than many I have met. No doubt a reflection of those who raised him.”

“Oh, of course.” Audry was a little confused before Eleya continued speaking, briefly extolling her son’s virtues. A decidedly proud little smile crossed her face, “thank you for saying as much. He was a handful growing up, I’m glad to see that he’s doing right by so many.”

“Was he? I would certainly like to hear more about that.” A smirk curled the corner of Eleya’s mouth as her gaze turned towards Alex for a moment. “Perhaps we should be seated first?”

There was no arrangement of seats, which initially perplexed Eleya, who was quickly placed between Carbon and Alex to buffer everyone else from her. Just to be on the safe side. It was only five people, and an extremely informal event despite the setting - the room was easily large enough for five more tables of this size, which could probably actually seat six. Right now it was empty save for them.

It looked exactly like Noonan’s. Thick green carpet, rich dark wood everywhere, floor to ceiling. Warm, cozy lighting. Like someone had lifted the design and turned it into a small dining room. Even had the regular menus waiting at each seat. It left Alex with a strange sense of nostalgia, despite having only known about it for six months. He had enjoyed hanging out there.

Their waiter arrived not long after they sat, and took drink orders. He was equipped with a translator as well, which made sense. Also seemed a bit more put together than the crew at Noonan’s, actually dressed like the guys who brought up room service from *Gardien de Phare* now that Alex was thinking about it. Who had DSS clearance to enter the diplomatic suites. It made sense.

Things were going pretty smoothly. Ed had a lager, Alex went for his usual porter. Carbon tried the brown ale that they had recommended to her last time. Audry had a Last Word, which brought Eleya’s attention to the drinks list on the back of the menu. She ordered a Titan Tea. 

The Titan Tea was just a Long Island Iced Tea with a silly name because they were in space. Alex though it was probably the least Eleya sounding item on the menu, but the Tsla’o did love their tea. He would have suggested an Old Fashioned, or maybe a Martini, if she had asked.

The conversation bubbled around him as he surveyed the menu again. Maybe the last time for a while, if not the last time ever. He already knew he was getting a double bacon cheeseburger, there was no other thing on the menu he was interested in. He still read it while his mom regaled everyone with the story about the time he ran into the funicular’s door at full tilt. No injuries, thankfully, other than a knot on his forehead and bruised pride. 

He had come to laugh about that, in time.

The drinks came. Alex had forgotten that they put Titan Teas in a pint glass, and the bar had a tendency to pour very strong. Eleya seemed to hold her liquor well, and he had only seen her have two drinks so far today. Shouldn’t be an issue.

He thought that until he noticed that she was speed running it, drinking what was nearly half a pint of booze like water.

Ok, he’d definitely steer her towards something less alcoholic if she tried to get another drink.

“Yes, when he was about five, he had just decided that space was his favorite thing. Collected space ships, learned about planets. He wanted to visit every planet and moon in the system.” Audry smiled, wistful as she recalled a somewhat less embarrassing fact about him.

“Hasn’t changed much in that regard.” Ed added, looking at Alex over the top of his menu. “First time I threw him in a simulator, I shut the pod door and by the time I was back to the monitoring station, he had accurately charted a course out to Cassiopeiae on the Superlight network. Had to remind him that protocol involves checking the map first, and that would be on the test.”

Excitement had gotten the better of him in the moment. “Yeah, I sat down and started getting to it. I had just been brought back into the program and it was the first time I had been allowed in a real Scoutship simulator. Felt like I had something to prove.”

“No, I mean that’s unusual. Most people don’t have the jumps out of Sol memorized, let alone enough knowledge to intuit a well optimized trip. If you will recall, you had five segments  programmed when I gave you that warning.” Ed laughed, very much amused by this. “I did six runs and I probably can’t make it past Proxima without double checking the charts.”

“Come on, Proxima is literally the second line.” It wasn’t that hard. He just visualized the network really well.

“I know my limits.” Edwin found that pretty amusing too. “How would you get to Gliese 687?”

“Conventional wisdom is to go through Struve 2398, as it’s nearly a straight line.” It wasn’t very far away but there wasn’t much going on at 687 other than mining, so it didn’t have a direct link to Sol. Early hopes that one of Struve’s planets would be terraformable fell through, but it ended up with several industrial stations and a Superlight beacon as a stepping stone. “But as it’s only cargo rated lanes going through there, speeds are limited. You can take a high-speed link to 61 Cygni, which also has a high-speed to 687. Probably save ten hours.”

Alex was conspicuously aware that everyone was staring at him by the time he finished saying all that. At least they looked impressed.

Ed grinned. “I rest my case.”

Alex, you big dork. Stop acting like you're normal.

I gotta say, I kind of miss the original draft of this chapter. I played way too loose with what sort of stuff Eleya would be able to get away with, and some things just didn't transfer over with how the situation in the Empire is with colonization now. Plus all that secrecy about the marriage and what have you went out the window for some jokes, which was not great as far as continuity is concerned. But I liked the jokes. I might try to work them in to a side story.

Hi so me (F26) and my bf (M28) we are together for 5 years. Everything is perfect we live together for 4 years we are even planning to marry and have kids soon . When I met him he was a bit of a “bad guy “ he got lots of messages from girls when we were together and I ask him does his seeing somebody except me which he replied no.Most my friends told me I should not worry about who is he talking to because we are not in a relationship and that I’m being toxic and I should only care if he has a gf . He told me he don’t have a gf so we keep seeing each other for few months .


After some talking he opened up and told me he really want good caring girl and he wouldn’t need any other girls or even girl friends (I didn’t ask him that he just told me ) After 3 months of being just casual he asked me to be his gf and I said yes . Few days later he’s friends ask him did you brake up with ur gf( he didn’t know I was with him in the room) which he just laughs and told him he will call him later . I asked him about that and he told me it was just a joke I later met he’s friend and he told me the same story and he really has a weird humor so I didn’t think much of it  .



 5 years later we were talking how we met and how stupid we were back then funny stories from that time thinking’s etc . And I asked him again about his friend question. He told me it’s eating him up for years but he is ready to tell me the truth . He told me he had a gf whole time while we were seeing each other (we were having sex at that time) I stayed shocked that broke me so much .I know he would never cheat on me he works go to gym and sleep sometimes coffee with friend but even that’s rare . He told me his gf back then was very toxic and he just wanted someone to care for him but he was too scared to brake up with her . Also they broke up 3 days before we started relationship she.At that time someone was constantly calling him and sending messy(probably her ) but he told me it was just a job . He told me he stoped having sex with her when he met me but I don’t really believe in that . What should I do? I fell like my whole life was a lie I can’t believe I was someone second option . 

TL;dr found out my boyfriend had a gf while he was seeing me after 5 years of relationship and it broke me ",5,1731933561.0,relationshipadvice,9,1.0,False

Looking for someone (22–30) to help distract me from reality a little. I’m not sure what specific interests to share here, as a good conversation takes more than just common hobbies. Briefly, I’m into cinematography (please don’t ask me about my favorite film—it's impossible to choose), literature, linguistics, history, and psychology—or really, anything I can explore with passive curiosity.
I have a cat (very orange behavior). I start every day with black coffee. I leave dim lights on when I go to bed. I’m better at starting new things than continuing old ones. I’ve probably walked around all the streets in my area, which is upsetting. Sometimes, I try to imagine the taste of blood in my mouth. YT video essays are pretentious (like so many other things today), but I love them. I cut my own hair. More than anything, I love the sensation of buying or using a new detergent or soap, or doing laundry. I prefer memorizing new words by writing them on paper hundreds of times rather than swiping through digital flashcards. I never talk to my neighbors. I avoid looking in mirrors in the dark. I only buy Irish whiskey. I don’t pick up the phone unless my best friend is calling. I read better on long train rides. I leave unopened envelopes on my desk for days before dealing with them.

my very first post :).
I am into specialty coffee for a few months. I was purely a milk drinker (flat white) and looked for nutty, chocolatey tastes.
After I tried alternatives at The Glitch in Tokyo, I started to discover a fantastic journey of black and specialty coffee. 

Setup:
Grinder - Ode Gen 2
Method: hario V60 v02- plastic 
Filter: hario V2
Scale: timemore mini

Within the last 4 weeks I tasted around 10 specialty coffee beans. The ones I liked most are from Colombia with a medium light roast and mostly anaerobic processed or natural.

Right now I am tasting the following beans:
- Bonanza—> Sitio Vargem Grande Brazil - Toffee|Dark Chocolate|Strawberry Jam

- DAK —> Milky Cake - Cauca Colombia

- Glitch —> Columbia Huila La Loma - Vanilla, Rum, Mill Chocolate 

Challenge:
I find it difficult to dial in those beans. I tried coarser (7) and finer (3) and everything in between. Water temp from 87 degree to 93 degree. But it is always too acidic. It seems like I am not getting out enough extraction?!

Can someone support?

1gu3ir7,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1gu3ir7/the_quilt_of_hides_and_fibers/,The Quilt of Hides and Fibers,"It was a late freeze in January. The days had been rampant with dust infested breezes, the nights fell to a whisper and the town was a low frenzy. A mash of triumph and tragedy, chaos.. and (dis)order. A whirlpool of luck’s many shades. Latency in our ability to connect naturally… The fear of being natural. Off the range, and willfully in a kennel.. 
 
    This evening was met with a sequence of pops in the air, a festive hustle and bustle like kernels over an open flame. Suspicion, a lingering mist suggesting opportunistic malice dancing to the rhythm of this celebratory transition.
 
    The purpose of it all had lost its claws years ago. It was a time before I was alive to witness the travesty. Seemingly, it was one of many frigid slap fights with members of the same species. Divisions caused by differing idols of representation, which were just as chaotic and nonsensical as our own. Ever since then, we slowly became… well… a concrete plantation with a defective billboard to the attraction. A spectacle where if the proletariat of patriotic delusion didn’t sing and dance for the scraps of hollow guarantees and mislabeled freedoms, then they were destined to become part of the charade of conflicts through decimation. “Another day in paradise”, the submissive obliged would proclaim with stained grins of shit-eating compliance and deteriorating posture, living out their reductive ambitions.

     Labyrinthine games with no definite rules, but only for a chosen few, were never for those that oversaw and conducted the performance. The confusion of roles within its confines were free to disregard, but never evade. It was all starting to burst at the seams as the starving became ravenous, desperate, and overgrown with agitation. The metamorphosis of a social experiment gone awry, and we were the subjects of a mundane and intimately impersonal chokehold.

     Chanting was echoing through the illuminated shroud of night, a unison, the occasional form of order timed annually, when all conflict ceased for a single breath. The cacophonous rhythm was brief, a burst of revelry followed before the “business as usual” flow of fermented tri-centennial chaos ushered in another run of redundancies and sweet nothings.

     A car show took place by the nearest stream to commemorate some shallow ideology of belonging, a showcase of overpriced manufactured hunks of scrap made in places of vast bounty, places where the tarnished hands are denied access to the fruit of their labor. It was a reality that wept from within the vessels. If you listened closely, you could hear pleas falling on deaf ears, an echo chamber of misery singing a familiar refrain... broken promises. 
 
    Winds of cool assurance that usually eased into the early hours of the new day flowed with punctuality. A brief relief to a façade we tell ourselves is *fine*. The reality is, we lost communal trust when the bright distractions took over our focus and loyalty. The Borg. A collective of polarization.

     It was to be a demanding day, 6am shift, just after sunup. It was fortunate that I didn’t have to go in for another 4 and a half hours. It was fortunate that I didn’t take to the traditional dance with my former demons. A commendable and condemnable gesture depending on the spectator. Freedom in a nutshell, this tightrope above a pit of venomous creatures... Self-loathing projectors… It was a statistical symptom traversing to the other side, only to find a solid wall with a mural of fabricated hopes and dreams illustrated among a shroud, a quilt of hides and fibers. 

Now that the bombs had dissipated into the echoes of a memory, it was time to prep a pot of coffee and have a power nap. Yet another workweek of being the Energizer zombie.

-The Preparation

   Impositions of mechanical gurgles and steadily sporadic droplets of stained water cascaded into the glass receptacle. An aroma of a hopeful glimmer painted the air with the yields of Brazilian roasted distress in a can, bold and smooth, as the glow of a bright morning blessed the kitchen’s blackout curtains with promises of opportunity.

     I never enjoyed mornings. It was all an imposition of the senses and the mere thought of it was enough to get my heart racing. The impatient commuters, blazing sunshine, chipper beings born for these hours, missionaries of positive vibes gifting their verbal sentiments like watchtower pamphlets. It was an amalgamation to put an extra strain on the worn and inefficiently charged batteries of socially awkward internalizers that surfaced from the realm of nocturnal meditations and solitude.

   The machine broke the silence. “Drink your fuel, you peasant.” It beeped. Sounds of early morning workers of hungover proportions, spectral walks of life, revving their contraptions to expedite warmth, the humming penetrating the old seals of single-paned windows.


   There was a time when this was a noble endeavor, a time being a malleable moron, days of existential infancy. A time when every hand was a guiding one regardless of what it held in its grip. There were enough scars remaining to know better, a diminishment of brain cells left from coping with the pandemonium, difficulties to react on a whim. A seemingly fair trade for a cynical old soul. A fair trade for consideration.

#Alien Nation Epilogue: A Thousand Cuts

Back in her office, Amilita gazed down at the treaty. A flimsy piece of paper. Fragile. She wondered if the choice of medium had been deliberate.

Now for it to be reviewed as much as it could possibly be, under the careful guidance of one overly-curious Lady Rakten. When Amilita had finally relented to explain what it was, her old friend had let drop some of that noble tutelage and revealed genuine excitement and worry. She'd also cleared her afternoon to help, taking a moment to scurry into her private office.

""You did well to call. The worst possible stance you could give facing the Planetary Governess right now is 'vulnerable'. You shouldn't have entered negotiations without me,"" the Rakten matriarch chastised. ""Or at least had some noble help.""

""That wasn't an option, he insisted that I come alone, and didn't give me a way to really bargain on that. Besides, I'm an officer, I'm cleared to engage in these hostage negotiations. It's well within my authority.""

""You misunderstand. Technically allowed or not, when she finds out, Planetary Governess M'Pravasi will accept the noblewomen as returned and then order you to break the agreement anyway. When he inevitably counterattacks, she'll fire you 'for the mess you caused' before your new Governess even arrives, even if it wasn't your fault, and appoint some other General. You may not have been directly involved, but you are still tied to the fiasco of events here just by being in the old chain of command. This will be a fresh start with a new command staff in the eyes of everyone. However, with the right names backing you- namely, those released hostages, plus my name added to it..."" she sighed. ""Still, it's a reach, trying to add my name to it after the fact.""

""He also named you in the treaty, by the way,"" Amilita said as a closing note. ""Would that help tie you to it?""

The noblewoman paled and raised a manicured hand to her lips. ""He named me? Personally?""

""Your entire family, actually. It's an example of a noble family that would be allowed to remain indefinitely, and travel the state at-will, under his protection and even granted escort.""

""I wish you'd consulted with me before adding anything like that to the peace deal!"" Nive protested.

""The whole thing was his idea,"" Amilita said, trying to calm her friend. ""He did it around the same time as suggesting Myrrah Memorial Square. I think it was to set the impression that he doesn't want us all dead, or see us all as evil.""

Lady Rakten didn't seem to be listening anymore, staring off in the distance for a couple seconds, before turning her gaze back to Amilita. ""Sorry, yes. As I was saying, you will need all the help from the nobility you can get in order to give this the veneer of noble approval and authority. Including the ones you exchanged for.""

""And that will help?""

""Yes,"" she said firmly. ""I may have to call a few favors, and I recommend you treat the noblewomen with every courtesy, but it should ensure that you hold your post- and it would anger the noblewomen. M'Pravasi wouldn't dare."" She swallowed tightly, and then tapped at the air in front of her. ""Excuse me. I'm just reviewing the terms from over your shoulder. These are unprecedented.""

""They're not exactly bad, though, are they? When you really think about it."" Amilita almost tapped at the paper with a fingernail before backing off. The last thing she wanted to do was mark it in any way.

""He's It seems he means peace, since much of this seems to be what motivates the insurgency here to continue fighting,"" she mused. ""Let's see...classical human cultural events...arts, independence."" There was a glimmer in her eye. Even Amilita wasn't blind to the opportunities. ""Oh, now I wish I'd tried to be the new Governess. Can you imagine?""

""Whoever lands here's going to be thrilled,"" Amilita couldn't keep the grin from peeking past her tusks. ""Come on, help me spot any mistakes.""

If there were any, they would be buried in the exact amount of funding he'd ask for human affairs and industries, but with all he'd handed over, she had a feeling he had freely released most of his leverage in an act of good faith. For the first time in months, she was feeling optimistic.

A few minutes later, she had confirmation of the hostages were aboard a human vehicle headed toward the base, 'unknown ETA.'

With shaking hands, Amilita entered the treaty into the 'official acts.' Fleet command was notified as quietly as possible, by burying it amidst minutiae and a flurry of demands for her first part of the bargain, without outright saying that was why. A memo was fired off to the local congress simultaneously- and then new orders to the soldiers on and off base, *priority three*. Every pod leader on patrol and on-base would still halt their patrol and troopers in-place to announce the new orders immediately, but it wouldn't draw the attention of anyone outside the chain of command.

""They're here,"" her aide reported, eyeing Lady Rakten's projection nervously. She gave a sage nod and ended the connection. Amilita wasn't feeling calm at all, though.

*Who? The Hostages? A shuttle with a very pissed off Fleet Admiral aboard it? The Planetary Governess, to try and relieve me of my duties?*

Whatever the fallout, it had arrived, and she turned to the optical zoom.

Activating from its default position at the rebuilt front gate, she saw an enormously long yellow human vehicle was rolling forward and kicking up the loose. Several rifles were leveled at the bus by the attending guards, though an 'all clear' was quickly issued a moment later, the rifles raised to a salute position as the bus slowly rumbled forward.

By the time Amilita made it out of the building, Lesha was out of the bus and was leading a pack of very shaken and tired looking Shil'vati dressed in human clothing down the tarmac toward the garrison main HQ. Blinking past the setting sun to see Amilita's shadow fall over her, the lieutenant then grinned that winsome smile.

Most of the hostages seemed shocked to be free, craning their necks in disbelief, while a few tried to retain some dignity and gravitas as befit their station.

""Get these ladies to the medical bay for evaluation,"" Amilita ordered. ""Contact their families' retainers via the backchannels they so helpfully provided us, and inform them of our successful operation in their retrieval."" God knew she'd need their support to help keep the peace, and any gratitude she could earn would go a long way. ""The best food, best quarters we have available.""

Lesha moved to comply, but Amilita stepped in the way. ""As for you...""

It was ten minutes later in a locked office, a glass of scotch for each.

""You're kidding,"" Lesha said. ""Face to face? And you actually went for me?""

""Yeah,"" she chuckled lightly despite herself.

""*Stars and Strikes* is gonna *love* that. You'll be on the cover of all the new steamy novels.""

""Honestly, I had the ships keeping heat-scans on us just to make sure the scuttlebutt wouldn't get too out of hand. It almost caused an incident. All over my stupid ego over my reputation,"" Amilita muttered.

""Sounds tense.""

""You have no idea. He didn't even bargain for your cost, I think he was happy to get rid of you."" She shot a look with a wry grin. ""You weren't causing him any trouble, were you?""

""Nope! I did talk with one of his lieutenants, though.""

""What'd he say?""

""A bunch of strange questions like if we were going to invade Delaware with other humans."" she shrugged. ""Oh, and he told me that Emperor had been injured in the battle, but is feeling better. How did he look?""

""The battle for Fort Delaware?""

""No, no, for Heartbreak Hill, or whatever they're calling it. All better by today, though.""

Amilita's heart froze up for a moment, and then she chuckled.

*No, that would just be silly.*

""What is it?"" Lesha asked.

""Nothing. Help me with making sure the Noblewomen are happy- and understand who freed them, and so on. I'll need their favor to keep my post after the deal I just made.""

""Aww come on, I've had a really rough day!""

""There's no rest for the wicked,"" Amilita poked her Lieutenant with a grin. ""Come on. I have a lot to catch you up on.""

*****

I was back in the rear of the same supply truck that had dropped me off- probably not the most prestigious way of getting around, but I didn't trust that Amilita had sent out the orders just yet, and it was always better safe than sorry. Radio and Vaughn were getting a ride home with Gavin, set to split off to parts unknown.

""What do you say to going off with Radio and Vaughn?""

George turned to face me, holding one hand against the inner wall of the truck. ""Why?""

""Radio can keep an eye on Vaughn. And Gavin. I mean, I'm sure Radio's very interested in the tech, but I worry he'll lose focus.""

""You didn't say why *I* should go.""

I felt a little caught out. ""I...well..."" The truck bumped along slowly.

""I get it. There's nothing here for me. Not anymore. Not even my dad's truck, probably."" He patted his empty pocket.

""I'm sorry,"" I managed hoarsely. ""I- your father was a...a good man."" An interesting man. Full of faults, vices, rage, and kindness. Brilliant, really. Navigating a world that seemed to want him pushed down and out, raising a son by himself who the world had nothing better planned for. ""Do you think he'd want you to live in his house after he was gone?""

""I think he'd want me to fix the front door when I get back,"" George said wryly. ""But past that, no.""

I'd give him a hand with that. It was just being neighborly- and not at all a small tinge of guilt.

""He always wanted better for you. He taught you so much, but as jaded as he got, he still hoped you'd do more.""

""I think that's every dad's hope,"" he smiled from under his mask. ""They can't control the times we live in, though.""

""Guess not."" I ducked to glance through the back of the truck's slightly-raised roll-up door to stare at the old black Lincoln Town Car following us.

""I saw what they were offering to keep Radio invested. They want to keep him busy learning stuff, giving him equipment he's never seen or heard of, all on some official-sounding scholarship. His mom will be thrilled. I mean, I trust him to keep an eye on those two. They seem fine, but...""

""But they're Feds,"" he laughed. ""Sending me with is putting a lot of eggs in one basket, isn't it?""

""I suppose. Yeah."" If they turned on both George and Radio, where would that leave me? Sam and Maize each had ties to Sullivan and Gavin, it seemed. I didn't want to be at their mercy. ""It has occurred to me that I haven't explicitly said he'd stabbed me in the back. I said that an example should have been made. For all I know, they thought I was about to execute a lieutenant just for the sake of optics. Do you think we could tell them I was bothered by how easily Vendetta tried to step into my shoes, or that he overstepped his bounds while I was gone and started acting like the role was permanent?""

""It would make it clear that they need to keep him on a tight leash. But that's not enough.""

""It's not,"" I agreed. ""They know if he sets foot back in Delaware, he's dead.""

George stared at me for several seconds, and I turned away from the door, letting it slam back down on the next bump.

""So, that's it then? We just let him live? If you dispatch us on missions to the other states, he'll kill you at HQ and wait for us to get back with whatever little posse he forms. One at a time, I bet.""

""Shit."" I could see it. ""Sam doesn't like him, though. Neither does Maize. I think as long as we make it clear he's in the doghouse and not to return to Delaware, under any circumstance...?""

""Not gonna cut it.""

I sighed. ""Then what do you want me to do? I can't blow up what we've got with Sullivan and Gavin.""

George shrugged. ""I'm glad to not be in charge, I don't have to make that call. Though if I see him without them around, I'm killing him. So maybe don't send me with them.""

""Yeah, I-""

There was the sudden</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> squeal of brakes, and I almost slid across the floor as the truck braked hard.

I glanced down at my blue box, clutching my pistol. No warning message from Radio yet.

""What's going on up there?"" I spoke into the walkie-talkie.

I heard voices outside- not shouting, but just conversation, muted and broken up by the engine.

""People,"" the handheld radio squawked back.

""Who?"" I asked.

""Uh, us."" The response was hesitant and uncertain.

'Us?'

George raised his submachine gun, and then patted his pockets for spare magazines, seemingly reassured.

""Wait, George."" I kept my pistol out, then undid the latch holding the rolling door closed from the inside. I lay flat against the floor as the truck went over another bump. While I was now much more painfully aware of the potholes in the street, I could also catch brief glimpses of people coalescing back together in the wake of the truck as it rolled down the street.

The first landmark I saw was the 'Chinese Wall' of the city's main train line in the distance. We couldn't be more than two blocks away from Warehouse Base, then, or Something Else Square- taking a backroad to get North toward our neighborhoods. Shadowy figures finally came near an intact and lit streetlight, and I realized most of the people around the truck had obscured their faces. A lot of them had tied their shirts over their faces, a few had bandanas. And quite a few had proper-looking masks, some of them half-familiar.

The truck tried rolling forward, the crowd seemed to grow thicker and thicker, slowing down more and more.

Well, whatever doubts Amilita might've secretly harbored about whether or not we were bluffing about not being out of people was *thoroughly* shattered.

""What should we do?"" The radioman asked as the truck's brakes squealed to a stop. I wanted to tell him he had a better idea than I did as to what was ahead of us, but if I had to guess, it was packed.

I couldn't see into Gavin's car, and my finger hesitated over the 'send' button.

""Try and press through,"" I instructed.

""Run 'em over?""

""Slowly, gently, you know?""

""Run 'em over slowly and gently?""

""Nah, just- nevermind. Take it slow, be safe. I'll be back- wait at the square's edge when you're through.""

""What are you doing?"" George asked.

I swallowed. There were a *lot* of people. If our driver had gotten this wrong and it was some kind of counter-protest, then I was about to make a *huge* mistake.

*Fuck it.*

I threw open the back of the truck- and it may as well have unveiled a huge gust of wind for the way people rocked back and raised their heads, and then their arms to follow just a second later. Some tapped fists to chests, others almost seemed startled to see me.

I raised my own, and then stepped toward the side of the truck where there was a steel handle to grip onto, and then jumped down to the curb as the truck slammed its brakes again. I dipped into the crowd, advancing as a small series of cheers erupted behind me. More of the crowd turned and then started to part. I didn't dare slow down as I weaved between the crowd.

I could see a pedestal- empty and awaiting a statue of some sort in the otherwise sparsely decorated square, almost like it was a blank template awaiting some kind of decision for what to do with it now.

*Man, this place really does live up to its current name, doesn't it?*

The crowd grew louder and louder, until it was almost thunderous.

Jesus, there had to be hundreds gathered here. And they'd come quickly, too. Just how fast could word travel?

I'd intended to use the pistol to shoot out one of the windows of the skyscraper and then leap as far away as I could from the building, if I had to. All the while hoping to god the gravity belt I wore underneath would save me. Now I used the crowd's tendency to give me a couple feet of distance to get a running start, and then twisted the control knob to soar just barely over the heads of everyone who watched, landing on top of the little flat platform.

I raised my hands, aware of the long shadows cast.

A blast of noise hit me like a wave, and the people charged forward to the pedestal, suddenly unclogging the street as they practically stampeded inside the square. Cell phones and omni-pads appeared like mushrooms after the rain, even as some of those in better-made masks tried to slap them down.

I thumbed the vocoder, and raised my voice. ""Everyone!"" I bellowed- and even my own ears hurt from the volume. At least I did get all their attention, even my followers stopped trying to bat away all the recording devices aimed at me.

""Ladies and gentlemen,"" I waved to them. ""I am here to say this: The war for Delaware is over. We have won!""

The roar was ecstatic- but also confused. Alarmed, almost. Questions surged forward on a thousand tongues, impossible to pick any apart.

I motioned to 'settle down.' It seemed a good number of those present were just curious passersby who had followed the crowd, or perhaps loosely-affiliated through whom word had spread already.

""The Shil'vati have agreed to observe the election fairly. We will dispatch election monitors to ensure it is, and they have agreed to let those we dispatch return to us. They also agreed to the return of all those who were so wrongly arrested and taken from their homes."" It didn't hurt to claim credit for what had already happened, I supposed. ""They agreed to observe our human holidays and traditions. They will invest in our cultural heritage, industry and jobs. There is more- so much more! But what matters most is: Delaware is yours! The violence is over! They will return our children. They will honor and respect our marriages, our culture, and more. No more being afraid in your own homes! There is more, I promise you. In exchange, *all attacks on Delaware soil must cease immediately.* We will dispense new orders- soon, I promise! But the main point is this: We have won our peace!""

I eyed the truck I'd been riding in the back of- G-Man was waving to me as the crowd had thinned out from the road, rushing in to hear me. It would be clear sailing, if I used the jump-off point, and there weren't any trees...

I lowered my hands. ""For now I must go, but I will return. To those Shil'vati-"" I switched to High Shil' *""We do not seek your death, only our freedom. We will abide by the terms of the peace. This could all have been avoided- but you chose what the last year has led to. You have tried to kill me, capture me, and failed. Now, let us try something new.""*

Then I flicked back down the vocoder's volume, took several running steps and launched myself toward the truck, across the square.

I landed just short, and was afraid I was about to be flung by the belt straight into oncoming traffic, when George's hand snagged mine and he twisted at the hips to hurl me inside the truck. I tumbled inside without grace or dignity, mercifully out of sight as the rolling door slammed shut and the truck roared out of the square.

""Thanks. You think they'll keep the peace you just announced?""

""Only one way to find out, and I say we give them a chance. I think you'll need a hand. This is a lot of changes- and a familiar face will help.""

""I think so.""

*****

""So?"" Borzun asked.

""So what?"" Amilita looked up from her mug of coffee, not liking the way Borzun was leaning in toward her friend's desk. It reeked of far too much eager curiosity for the morning hour.

""How was he?""

""Fine, I guess."" She yawned and took a sip, only to see Borzun still squirming for details. She swallowed the bitter mouthful. ""I mean, he wasn't this hulking monster of a brute, ten feet tall and made of glowing radiation.""

""Easy for you to say!"" Borzun snorted. ""I was so terrified when he barged in on me, I could barely hear what he was saying. I thought *for sure* I was dead.""

""I think they play that part of him up on purpose. I don't think it's who he is, really.""

""Then who is he?"" She asked.

Amilita took another sip. ""No idea. How far has word of what happened traveled?""

""You could have invaded Pennsylvania and caused less of a ruckus,"" Amilita's aide laughed. ""National Government Liaison Lieutenant Ryiannah has been requesting meetings all day, and is going to fly to the garrison around midday, appointment or no. The Admiralty is staying oddly quiet.""

""Azraea lost- they're probably still weighing whether what I did was the right thing- and who else they could even try to put in as General after me. I doubt anyone capable would take the assignment.""

""Lots to lose, not much to gain,"" Borzun chuckled.

""I imagine they'll prefer that you be a problem for the new Governess, and leave the mess for her to deal with. If she wants to break or keep the peace, even after you advise her- well, then that's on her. All you did was hand her a green zone, which reflects well on the military. They won't want to punish you for managing that,"" the adjutant added.

""A unique situation,"" Borzun admitted, appraising the new adjutant with a degree of newfound respect. ""All the noblewomen have broken orbit and started their way home. It's honestly more of a mess that they're coming home. Imagine having to boot your daughter out of your own seat of power. Hopefully it's not going to be too much of a problem.""

""Speaking of family..."" Amilita said. ""I've been allowed to request family relocation. It's up to them, of course, but it would be nice to have them in-system.""

******

Deep under a remote hill, a machine began to excavate, digging up an old leaky pipeline or well that had been found somewhere in the state archives. Why it took truckloads of concrete to the same location never seemed to be asked by either the work crews or what few passers-by came through. Maybe it was to cap the well? No one knew, and no one asked.

Still, over the FM Radio the Afternoon NewsFlash buzzed over the din of construction on the Northern border of Delaware - ""Terms include the restoration of monogamous marriage and human cultural arts and activities,"" the show host DJ read aloud, before laughing. ""Wait a second, that's us! Spread some love to Q-102!"" Their co-host cut in. ""Ah but we're in Philly! What else- oh, some stuff about books, human literature, funding for craftsmanship and economic development. Arts, singing- it sounds like we'll have to open a studio down there- any takers? The zone's still *technically* classified yellow, even though it has been a solid week since anyone's been attacked. No rebel activity reported- that's right. None!""

*****

##The More things Change...

A truck full of women worked in silence, glaring daggers at the Shil'vati as they hoisted up rubble and trash. The last of the block was cleared of debris and carted to the rented dump, then hoisted by a Shil'vati Dropship's tongs and carried to the landfill.

One Shil'vati private waved, though the human crews stuck entirely to themselves. There was peace, but it was a frosty one.

""I miss shooting them,"" one woman grumbled, leaning on her shovel.

""It was fun to watch them duck,"" the other agreed, her curls bobbing when she shook her head at the waving shil'vati.

""At least they can't make a pass at our husbands without us taking it out of their hides.""

""Makes me feel a little better about the kids getting Halloween back- and sending them out. At least Johnny won't be arrested for wearing a mask this year. Are you coming around for Thanksgiving?""

""I'd love to- we get the day off again?""

""All part of the deal.""

A masked man walked up- and the waving Marine suddenly pointed and glared as he took an angle grinder and cut down the pole with Shil'vati signage and a camera at its top. ""Missed something,"" was all he grumbled, before walking off, dragging the sign down the street behind him toward the next dumpster as the metal rattled against the asphalt.

*****

##...The More They Stay the Same

The masked insurgent stared and tried to not shake in fear. Chris was still in training, his muscles burning from the morning's fierce training. That had been before he'd been yanked out of line for breakfast and told he had to go help monitor the election. He had been given a knife, a mass-produced skull mask, and a rail-pistol that threatened to shatter his wrists into powder if ever he used it regardless of how much they'd scaled it down. He'd gone from arrested, to pardoned, to a volunteer in a matter of days. Now he was staring down the enemy, positioned across a chipped and frayed laminate folding table, as the human poll workers did their best to ignore the both of them.

The Shil'vati Marine standing opposite him was *huge*, her own muscles bulging, and her equipment shiny and new. She kept looking around the room, as if confused. More strange, still, was that she wore basic 'patrol armor,' none of the extra padding. Flexi-fiber, it was called. The skin-tight undermesh, and seemingly nothing else. All this was starting to feel like too much for poor Chris.

""So,"" she said, and he tried to not jump or pull the knife.

""Uh...are we supposed to talk?"" He tried to not squeak.

""I mean, we can if we like, can't we?""

He didn't know. He was supposed to watch people count when it was all done and over with- and sit there and make sure a huge stack of them didn't get stuck on top or moved around, or so on. ""Maybe?""

She seemed to digest that for a couple seconds, before making her decision. ""I'm Moret'ia.""

""I'm probably not supposed to give you my- oh, uh, code name..."" he fumbled as she bent down to hear him- and giving him plenty to look at. He swallowed. ""C-cobra.""

It would be at least a month until he was deployed anywhere. He hadn't actually earned that name, yet. Supposedly they were still getting his paperwork for Pennsylvania in order. His cover story was still getting arranged, too- words like 'crick' for 'creek' and other localisms were still working their way into his lingo. Not that it seemed to matter with how his tongue froze in place.

""You know, I mean, these guys seem to have this whole 'counting' thing handled. Now, I'm going to go to the bathroom, but I can't just leave you here alone..."" she smiled and tugged the fastener for her skintight undermesh just a little bit lower down her chest.

*****

""...and in surprise results, the Republican and Democratic candidates have both suffered an almost-uninterrupted string of defeats in the face of extremist outsider, write-in and third-party candidates, in what has been a contentious election year. General Amilita, acting as Governess until the new Lady Altena arrives, has promised to honor the results. The defeated incumbents are promising to challenge this, however, and Washington will be dispatching Certified Election Official Experts to try meeting with the General later. She has so far said she will refuse to meet with them until the proper Governess has arrived and settled into her seat. There's still hope, dear listeners, as the final count isn't yet decided. The federal courts have issued injunctions and objections, with officials and experts saying that there is 'no chance whatsoever' that this is legitimate, and that the people of Delaware would never vote for such xeno-phobia after being rocked by countless events of terrorism.""

The man snorted and looked up from his sandwich. ""'Rocked'. You catch that?"" He looked skyward, as if more might tumble from the sky.

""Pretty sure it just slipped out,"" his friend chuckled, sipping his thermos in the chilly air. ""Wonder if he'll get in trouble, or if he's secretly kinda cool.""

""In trouble with who? The HSF are just plain cops again, and they don't seem to give a shit about much."" He took a small bite.

""Yeah, fuck 'em.""

""They still suck,"" agreed the man with the sandwich.

""You ever wonder what we're building under here?"" He asked, glancing out at the heavy machinery. ""It's digging a huge hole in a big hurry, like hollowing out a hill from down low. I thought the aliens hated tight spaces.""

""For all I care to know, it's some eccentric shil'vati who's got a pass to travel outside the purple areas. Whatsername again- that shil' noble and her family."" He shrugged.

""Hey, as long as the pay's good, right?""

""And not along the way for any checkpoints between Wilmington and here. Might actually make it home on-time for once.""

""You didn't hear? Those are gone, too.""

He whistled. ""No shit?""

*****

""...Emperor appeared in person at Myrrah Memorial Square today, and also proclaimed a surprise memorial site at the battle Heartbreak Hill, or 'of Camp Death,' as he called it, causing a stir among rights and activist groups. While there, he urged his followers that Freedom of Speech has returned- can you believe the gall of him? Half a year ago he kidnaps a DJ from our office and straps a bomb to him- and now says *that.* Well, I suppose we're *allowed* to say some things against the Shil'vati, but who'd be dumb enough to? Honestly.""

""Well, I think-""

""No one cares what you think. If you finish that sentence-""

""You'll *what?* Sic a bunch of bootlickers on me? Drive me out of my house? You and what army?""

The shouting elevated, until the Beatles' *All You Need is Love* echoed through the tinny radio.

I laughed as the tune entered the first lines. *There's nothing you can do that can't be done...* It seemed some of the reforms were going to take longer to sink in than others.

""It has been a day,"" I mused, hopping out of Sam's sidecar and stripping off the mask. ""Any word from Gavin?""

""He's got the forge for NeoSteel operating almost back to the capacity it was at back in Maryland- the scientists seem to like the new facility,"" Sam said. ""*Hillside* is under construction. Lots still to do there- but it looks promising. They sent home all the workers, figuring they can get the rest done themselves. Should have three more facilities set up before next year, operational before Valentine's Day. Full production's going to take longer, though.""

""And the first full set of deployments to Pennsylvania?""

""Going well. They've made contact with beleaguered insurgent cells, and basically taken over. Recruitment from the prisons went beautifully.""

""How's G-Man doing in New York?""

""Not great. Honestly, I think his heart isn't in it, and it seems there are some pretty active cells already- he's having all kinds of trouble getting started. Some of the other states are doing much better.""

""I'm sure he'll come around to it. What about New Jersey?""

Sam Hog Harley smiled and leaned on his motorcycle, the suspension sagging somewhat. ""One of the teams over there is really doing an amazing job. It's gone from Green to Red. Another one of Sullivan's, who's eager to meet you. Heck, they all are, from what I hear, but this one's quite the eager follower.""

""Good, good. Maryland's just starting to reverse its trend back toward Red. They're still waiting on a General. Shame the twins wouldn't go- I think they'd be okay.""

""They're really stirring up trouble in Virginia, huh?""

""Yep,"" I confirmed. ""Honestly, I'm glad. This could have gone badly in at least a dozen different ways.""

*****

The men pulled the stitched-together pieces of Shil'vati Marine undermesh up their thighs, then an arm pushed through each sleeve of the hanging down top-half. The shirts were fastened closed. Stretched over the veterans' bodies with what little elasticity remained of the original strange fabric, the undermesh fit awkwardly. Too tight in some places, hanging loose in others, and stiff in spots where they'd absorbed impacts prior to the death of the original wearer. But the man at the door said the more intact sections might catch a lasbolt or two before failing and so they suited up without complaint.

Hardly a word was said between them, even as the newscaster spoke on the radio. ""...in a surprise display of peace, tolerance, and understanding, the insurgency laid down arms throughout the state. The Emperor of Mankind has yet to put out an official statement beyond that of urging for a peace that he would enforce if necessary.""

One turned to the other. ""We're some kind of crazy,"" one muttered as they got into the back of the truck.

""Yeah. Leaving a place we fought for just as we get it.""

""Some kind of crazy...but the right kind of crazy.""

*****

#Homecoming

I arrived back at where I'd left my bicycle from another site inspection, giving a quick wave to the man who had given me a lift. No sooner had he gone around the corner than I started for where I'd left the bicycle, blowing out some of the cool autumn air and testing if it would frost.

There I found the omni-pad, refurbished and repaired before being returned to me- much like the bicycle. It had been left against the garage door without any explanation as to how it had gone missing. I hunched down to inspect it once again, confirming the signs that it had received yet another service in some shop.

I had asked Natalie about it, but she was as clueless as I was, and if Amilita knew, she wasn't telling. She seemed tense, ready for the other shoe to drop.

There were signs that things were finally easing up, though. I threw a leg over the frame and started pedaling home, just in time to see a Marine patrol pod of six round the corner. They were not nearly as heavily armored as I'd seen before, and their nerves had obviously relaxed. No longer were they twisting their necks at the skitter of a leaf across the asphalt, and they even returned my jaunty wave with a few of their own, none of them holding the rifle like they might snap it towards a sudden target.

On a whim, I hit the brakes and slowed, wincing slightly as the new brake pads let out a soft hiss.

""How's everything?"" I asked, letting the omni-pad float over my shoulder. ""Would it be alright if we took a photo together?""

The pod leader with visible scar tissue across one of her high cheekbones looked like she might object for only a brief moment, and then relented, even managing a smile and taking her gaze off scanning the bushes.

""Everything's fine,"" one of the privates gushed.

I noticed that none of them even had their charge packs loaded into their rifles.

""Really?"" I asked for confirmation, feigning surprise. ""No one's been giving you any trouble?""

""Nope!"" She chirped. ""I was nervous before I got here, but it's been fine, really. A few glares, but it's not too bad. We've even had the designation 'Green' made official! Celebrations are on for tonight!""

""I heard,"" I smiled back. ""Congratulations, and I'm happy that things are getting better."" There, 'better.' That was the right term for things. Not perfect. We were still occupied. Aliens still held almost all the cards. Yet we managed many of our own affairs now, and had a larger slice of autonomy. The people in office now weren't just strategizing their own self-interest, but trying to actually accomplish useful things. Everywhere seemed alive again, and crackling with the energy of possibility. ""What's next?""

""We're going to a concert later tonight to celebrate. I hear it's a band that plays some other artist's music? I think it's a kind of Classical Musical- 'Nirvana'? 'Creed'? 'The Eagles'?""

""That's a sports team,"" corrected the Sergeant, and I tried to not laugh.

""Wonderful, have fun!"" I didn't really have the time to educate them on classical music versus classic rock. They'd figure it out.

I opened my bag and let the repaired omni-pad float its way back inside, then shouldered one strap.

""Do you want to come?"" She offered, before the Sargent could object. ""We're done at five,"" another jumped in. ""It's a celebration. You should celebrate with us!""

""I've already got plans, sorry,"" I answered, and before they could say anything else, I put my foot down on the pedal and started to ride off, twisting at the hips to give another wave to the women in their skin-tight patrol-armor outfits. ""But thank you!""

Getting information like this was invaluable to understanding the tone of things on the ground. I'd learned to pick up on hesitation, swapped gazes, but their smiles had been perfectly genuine.

I made it home the rest of the way without any kind of further trouble. With the footage of the surrounding area I'd taken, I would be able to piece together a video Natalie might find interesting- and then we'd explore it together. *Gotta keep the interior happy, the insurgents happy, her happy...* was it wrong if I felt like all of these efforts succeeding was enough to make *me* happy? I'd accomplished a lot of what I'd set out to do. I'd won us a peace on our terms. I'd carved out space for our culture. I'd won us their respect as more than pitiable, desirable lovers. And I'd found where I belonged.

I punched in the code to open the garage and rested the bike on the back wall, in the spot in the garage I claimed. If Mother wanted to do something about it, I explained, she could take it up with the General. She had been looking a bit tense at our dinners, but kept the same smile going just like the radio told her to. Maybe the bulb at the bottom of my bag from her favorite garden shop would cheer her up- an amaryllis to look forward to in Spring.

I finally read the message from Amilita- despite the extra time, we hadn't spent much time together- or at least, I hadn't as Elias.

*-My son is apparently eager to come. Family should be together,* was all it said. Cryptic, but not at all threatening.

So why did the hairs on the back of my neck start to rise?

I dug the bulb free from where the omni-pad had settled on top of, then pushed open the door to the mudroom. There was no Bear to greet me this time- a little unusual, but nothing alarming.

""Hello?"" I called out. No answer, but I could hear my parents' voices down the hall. I set the bulb on the old dining room table and then continued up the stairs to the landing, then took the last three in one big step, raising my gaze only to freeze in place as I saw who was waiting for me.

Mom, Dad, and...

#The End of Alien-Nation (Book One)

Keep an eye out in /r/sexyspacebabes for the 'omake' where I'll detail out some various possible other endings to the story that people have requested. I've also fished out the 'hook' and cliffhanger for book two from this at the last minute, as it will be quite some time for now until Book Two starts getting chapters and I don't want to drive you all insane waiting. I have attempted to revise the story in book two, but to little positive effect. I may have to go with the original, but time will tell, as it's not on the front burner- revising this saga/'Book One' is.

Did not want to spend too much on the machine but yet wanted flexibility to choose brewing settings. Hence went ahead and ordered this beauty.

The machine just arrived today after some delay from courier and yet to play with preinfusion timer and other settings but what a machine.
Filter holder, tamper are well built and are heavy to hold.

Earlier was using a moka pot and seven beans dark roast filter coffee.
Had bought Revolver Roasters from my recent trip. The best coffee I had so far.

Blue tokai packs yet to try.

Seven beans Arabica was a blind buy to test out machine but the shot came out to be a little bitter probably because of notes of citrus and ginger.
Had an espresso shot and then later with milk.


Usually I have it espresso without sugar or with milk and sugar.

Currently using Agaro manual grinder and setting on 1, takes some real efforts to grind but I am OK with it for now as the grind is pretty fine and consistent.
Probably will upgrade to encore esp later.

Any advice on brewing, please share.",26,1731932394.0,IndiaCoffee,12,0.97,False

I recently did a coffee tasting/cupping with a nice Ethiopian coffee. This was just coffee in water, and it had a wonderful, smooth, body. Kind of reminded me of the mouthfeel of a pastry sour beer? 

However in our Hario Switch, that whole ""body"" feel completely disappeared (I suppose because of the paper filter and coffee oils..?). 

I'm now on the lookout for an at home brewing method that will retain it. I'm not a fan of coffee grounds in my coffee and like drinking it quite hot and in large volumes. So the questions are 
- Does the French Press mesh filter leave those oils in? 
-  Is there another method I could try, that separates the grounds, but leaves the body intact? 

Thanks! ",2,1731932306.0,JamesHoffmann,6,0.76,False

However, everyone I have made a coffee for (usually iced lattes or americanos (iced and hot) because I have a flair so no way to steam milk) complains they want their coffee to taste like coffee. Which means burnt traditional espresso sludge. Does anyone have a go to bean they just buy and store for occasions like this? Coffee has a long shelf life so I am not super concerned about storing it for it to be its freshest since it is gonna end up being a super dark roast anyways. Please let me know any recommendations!
