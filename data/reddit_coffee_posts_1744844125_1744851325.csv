1k10dq4,https://www.reddit.com/r/iih/comments/1k10dq4/was_just_diagnosed_im_on_day_two_of_500mg_diamox/,Was just diagnosed; I’m on day two of 500mg diamox. Have a few questions; freaking out a bit.,"Hi all, I got out of the ER on Monday evening after a week of horrible temporal headaches (previously had some bad headaches in Dec/Jan that went away). 
Anyway I got diagnosed with papilledema and IIH had to do blood tests, CT scans, 3 MRIs and a lumbar puncture midday on Monday. (After resting for a while I went on a short walk today/Wednesday— hope that was okay.) 

Eye doctor and other doctors told me I came right on time and that the whole thing is maybe a 1 outta five in severity? (I was on a lot of medication so don’t remember if they meant the iih or the eye swelling).

Anyway I’m trying to drink lots of water (so far i’ve been trying for 12ish glasses of water but it’s really hard), and some gatorade as well as a lot of potassium rich foods. I ordered some ultima power (it’s low in sodium i hear), and I’m trying not to miss any meals (I have Audhd and other mental health stuff so managing myself is hard). 

Feeling a bit down but relieved the headaches are (mostly) gone but lots of tingling and it’s freaking me out. And some acid reflux. I bought off-brand tums at CVS but I read online that I can’t take them with the Diamox?? Should I be taking a tiny bit of baking soda? I read online that sodium bicarbonate taken concurrently with diamox may cause renal stones?? I wanna lessen the tingling/acid reflux etc, but it’s only day two and I’m scared of messing anything up. 

I also have really good caramel macchiato ice cream I was hoping to eat. Can I not eat that either? I have been avoiding coffee (and i already barely have soda or alcohol). Should I avoid avoid salt? I’m peeing a lot and I thought I might need to replenish it to an extent. 

Anyway am I doing things right? Is there anything I need to know? I’m 24 and I’m at 202 lbs, but they told me I should try to get my weight down. (Goal is 150ish, which is what I was in 2022).

I went into the ER with bacteremia and after 30 hours in the ER turned septic. Throughout my admission in the ICU I was combative and heavily drugged and delirious. I had visual and auditory hallucinations, I was mostly blacked out with a handful of memories, I was acting the opposite of my personality and over all it was incredibly traumatic. It also left my body wrecked. I am weak, unsteady on my feet, my brain is a giant fog, most days I just meet needs (wake up, make coffee, feed the cats, take a nap, go to the bathroom, that’s about it). I know recovery is going to take months but I’m just so scared of the health I probably lost over this. I’ve been doom spiraling and reading every scientific paper I can find on post sepsis syndrome and none of them have good treatment or outcomes. Has anyone been through this before?

1k10b5o,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1k10b5o/my_summer_from_hell_with_my_obnoxious_furry/,"My Summer From Hell With My Obnoxious, Furry, Herpetophile Roommate/Coworker","This happened about 6 years ago when I (25 male) was working as a seasonal employee for a state wildlife agency in a remote mountain town. I was 19 at the time and it was my 3rd summer working for this state agency. I was the unofficial “manager” for a team of 6 people given my previous experience in the position. 

I lived in an old modular home with 3 of my coworkers, let’s call them Alex (21 male), Carl (23 male) and Thomas (26 male). Alex and I shared a room, Carl and Thomas had their own rooms and the 4 of us all shared one bathroom. When the season started it was just Alex, Carl and I living in the house. Thomas would be joining us a month later since his college classes let out later than ours. About 2 weeks into the job we were having a staff meeting and our boss pulled us aside.  She informed us that Thomas would be bringing a tarantula and a ball python with him. She asked how we felt about this and the three of us agreed that as long as they stayed in their enclosures we wouldn’t have issue.

Because of the work we were doing we would have to wake up around 3-4 in the morning to be able to arrive to our various work sites by 5 AM.  We would usually go to bed around 8-9 PM because of this. Thomas showed up to the house at 11 PM and woke us all up to help him move into the house that night. We asked if we could wait till after work the next day but he said he would at least like to bring his pets inside for the night. When we step outside to his car that was when he informed us that he had lied to our boss and that he had actually brought 4 tarantulas and 4 ball pythons with him. I wasn’t super thrilled about this but again, as long as they all stayed in their enclosures, I wouldn’t say anything. 

The next morning Thomas and I had been paired together so I could train him for our position. The work site we had been assigned to was about an hour and a half away from the house and we had to be there by 5 AM. I had told him this the night before and said that we needed to be on the road by 3:30 at the latest. I woke up at 2:45 and put on my uniform and sat down for a cup of coffee. By 3:15 I still hadn’t hear from Thomas so I knocked on his door and woke him up and told him that we needed to leave in 15 minutes. He was persistent that he needed to shower and that he would have enough time to do so. 

By the time we got into the work truck and started driving to our site it was 3:45. Then by the time we got to the main highway it was snowing, snow storms in early June are common in the area. During the drive I had put on a podcast so I wouldn’t fall asleep and drive us into a ditch. It was pitch black outside with near white out conditions at times. Thomas asked me multiple times if he could turn on his flashlight so he could read his book while we drive. After the third time I snapped at him and said, “No! I can barely see the road as it is and I don’t need a light on in the cab make it harder!”

We made it to our work site at 5:45, nearly an hour late due to the road conditions and late departure. It was still dumping snow/rain and our job required us to remain at the location in case the weather improved and we were able to resume our responsibilities. We spent the entire 10 hour shift stuck in the truck. Because of our work we were also provided with a WiFi hot spot so we were able to watch YouTube, Netflix, etc. to pass the time. I had brought a pair of headphones and put on a video. Thomas had no headphones and watched multiple hour long videos at full volume that discussed in deep detail furry suits. These videos would talk about which suits were the most affordable, which suits were better suited for your Fursona, Which suits were the most attractive/sexy. Even with my headphones in I could hear everything. It was the longest 10 hours of my life. 

Stay tuned for Part 2 possibly even Part 3. This was just the first 48 hours of my summer living/working with Thomas. They will include stories of him destroying and damaging several pieces of state equipment, His poor personal and general hygiene choices, and more. ",1,1744851024.0,badroommates,0,0.99,False
1k10aye,https://www.reddit.com/r/retailhell/comments/1k10aye/ive_got_people_thrice_my_age_trying_to_take_me/,"I’ve got people thrice my age, trying to take me down","So I recently, well a year ago, I joined a company which is a convenience food store chain in the UK. 
I’m a shift manager on paper but I’m basically store manager on an hourly wage. 

So get this, I work my fucking ass off, I complete all the tasks that need to be, I’m the quickest with stock, not to fart in my own arsehole, but I’m probably the best person in management at the moment

There’s this old lady who also management and been with the company for 12-15 years, all she does is sit outside, smoke all day and drink about 5 gallons of coffee. Gets 7 people on her shift for a 3 man job, so she doesn’t have to do anything, and we don’t have any hours left and we become understaffed on every shift she isn’t on.

Area manager doesn’t give a fuck, Store Manager overlooks this because she does the rotas, and other tasks that she REFUSES to teach the other 5 members of management so she continues to be an essential employee. 

Meanwhile, she talks shit about everyone, talks shit about everyone TO everyone, then licks their fucking arseholes out. 

Recently her and a younger member of management (who also does nothing other than sit and vape) recently went to our manager. 

So I come into work and he sits me down to have a chat, office door locked, and continues to ask me questions like, do you do cocaine in the bathroom? Have you had sexual relations with any member of staff out the back yard? HAVE YOU BEEN OFFERING TO SELL DRUGS ON PREMISES TO OTHER MEMBERS OF STAFF?

I almost walked out for good. 

I told him that If I had the luxury of snorting coke everyday id probably be doing it somewhere with Palm trees but not on this hourly wage. I don’t have any sexual relations here and I don’t deal with drugs, if needed I’ll piss in a cup for you if that helps you sleep.

In the end, he’s on my side and he told me that it’s bullying, however, this fucking tiny store is a madhouse and I’m losing my mind. I want to leave but I just don’t know where to go. Honestly I wake up, get in my car and drive to work, and sometimes I wish I could just crash, or die, or anything that could get me out of there, even temporarily because it is a fucking rats nest.

I go in there 5 times a week and every day I find out something new about my self, I’m a drug dealer, I fuck my colleagues, I snort lines in the bathroom, what’s next? SA allegations? Or maybe heroin on the shop floor? Fucking sick of this place.

1k10aw7,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Dagenspear/comments/1k10aw7/kate_yelena/,Kate & Yelena,"Yelena Belova stepped out of the cold winter night and into the warm embrace of Kate Bishop's apartment building, her breath condensing into clouds of mist. The lobby's soft lighting reflected off the gleaming marble floor, casting an eerie glow across the walls adorned with framed art prints. She walked with purpose, her boots echoing off the walls like the steady tick of a clock counting down to an unknown hour. Each step brought her closer to a conversation she had been dreading for weeks.

The elevator ride was painfully slow, giving her ample time to rehearse her apology. She had tried to put herself in Kate's shoes, to understand the pain and anger she must have felt when Yelena attempted to eliminate Clint Barton. Yet, as the doors slid open to reveal the hallway, she realized that words could never truly bridge the chasm between them. Her hand hovered over Kate's apartment number, the cold metal of the button a stark contrast to the warmth she wished to convey. With a deep breath, she pushed it and waited for the familiar ding that signaled her arrival.

When Kate opened the door, the look on her face was a tumult of emotions - surprise, anger, and a hint of wariness. She held the door open with one hand, her other hand on her hip, and her eyes narrowed slightly. ""What do you want, Yelena?"" she asked, her voice a cool challenge. Yelena swallowed hard, stepping into the cozy space filled with the scent of pine and vanilla candles.

""I've come to apologize,"" Yelena said, her Russian accent thick with sincerity. She held out a small, neatly wrapped package. ""I know words are not enough, but I hope this can be a start."" Kate eyed the gift skeptically before accepting it, her movements deliberate and measured. ""Why?"" she pressed, her curiosity piqued despite herself. ""Why did you decide to come clean now?""

The room was silent save for the crackling of the fireplace as Yelena searched for the right words. ""I have reflected on my actions,"" she began, her voice low and earnest. ""And I understand that I was wrong. I was blinded by loyalty and duty. But now, I see the truth in your friendship with Clint."" Kate's expression softened slightly as she carefully unwrapped the present, revealing a handcrafted necklace made of black and red beads. It was a delicate piece, a stark contrast to the deadly weapons usually associated with Yelena.

""I know this can never replace what I've done,"" Yelena continued, her eyes never leaving Kate's. ""But I want you to know that I am truly sorry. And if there is anything I can do to make it right, I will."" The air in the room grew tense as Kate examined the necklace, the weight of Yelena's words hanging in the space between them.

Without speaking, Kate stepped closer and fastened the necklace around her neck, the beads cool against her skin. ""Clint told me you stopped,"" she said, her voice a mix of anger and curiosity. ""That's enough for him. But I don't know about me.""

Yelena nodded solemnly, her eyes never leaving Kate's. ""I know I have a long way to go,"" she said. ""But I'm willing to try.""

Kate leaned against the wall, folding her arms across her chest. ""Why should I believe you?"" she demanded.

Yelena took a step forward, her hands open in a gesture of peace. ""I don't know,"" she replied. ""You're just special and I hated the idea that you may hate me for what I did. You're the only friend I have... even though we're not really friends.""

Kate studied her for a moment, her gaze unyielding. ""You're not making this easy for me, you know,"" she said finally.

""I know,"" Yelena said with a sigh. ""But you were right. I was blinded and I wanted someone to blame, to punish. It's all know.""

Kate's eyes searched Yelena's face, looking for signs of deceit or manipulation. But all she saw was regret and a desperate yearning for connection. She took a deep breath and stepped aside, allowing Yelena into the apartment. ""Alright, come in,"" she said, her voice softer now. ""We've got a lot to talk about.""

Yelena followed her in, taking in the familiar surroundings with a newfound sense of vulnerability. The living room was a comfortable mess, with books and archery gear scattered across the floor, and a half-finished cup of tea on the coffee table. It was a stark contrast to the cold, sterile environments she was used to. ""Thank you,"" she murmured, taking a seat on the couch.

SUMMARY^1: Yelena expresses her willingness to mend bridges and earn Kate's trust, though Kate remains skeptical. Kate decides to let Yelena into her apartment to discuss their issues, acknowledging the potential for a new understanding between them.

Kate closed the door behind her and sat down in an armchair across the room, the space between them feeling like an unbridgeable gap. ""I'm listening,"" she said, her arms still folded.

Yelena took a moment to gather her thoughts, her eyes flickering to the flickering flames before returning to Kate's. ""When I was sent after Clint, I didn't know the whole story,"" she began. ""I was told he was a threat, that he had to be eliminated, and that he was responsible for my sister's death. But after... after I saw the way you fought for him, the way you believed in him, I knew there was more."" She paused, her voice thick with emotion. ""And when I confronted him, I saw that I was angry at how little time I had with her and I was so stupid, I was so so wrong, Kate Bishop. My loyalty was misplaced and I hated that I didn't have Natasha anymore, that he lived and she didn't... I was wrong.""

Kate's expression softened slightly, her eyes never leaving Yelena's. She knew all too well the pain of loss, the burning desire for justice, and the blurred lines between right and wrong. ""Clint's not perfect,"" she said. ""But he's trying.""

Yelena nodded, her eyes glistening with unshed tears. ""I know,"" she said. ""And I... I want to try too. To be better. For Natasha, for Clint, and maybe, if you'll let me, for you.""

Kate's gaze fell to her hands, which were clenched in her lap. ""What do you expect from me?"" she asked, her voice quiet.

Yelena leaned back into the couch cushions, her eyes never leaving Kate. ""I don't expect forgiveness,"" she said. ""But I hope for understanding. And maybe, in time, a chance to prove myself to you. I think... I think I need you. You helped me.""

Kate's expression remained guarded, but Yelena could see the faintest flicker of something in her eyes that wasn't anger. ""I could tell you weren't, well, a monster,"" she said, her voice a little less icy. ""But I didn't know what you were. I'd like to think we could get past it. Because I do like you, Yelena.""

Yelena felt a weight lift from her chest. ""Thank you,"" she said, her voice barely above a whisper. ""That means more than you know.""

Kate's eyes searched hers, looking for any sign of deceit or insincerity. Finding none, she sighed heavily. ""Alright,"" she said, her arms unfolding. ""You're going to have to earn it, though. Prove to me that you're not just a Black Widow. Because I've just had to have mom put in jail, it's a little hard for me to just trust right now.""

Yelena nodded solemnly. ""I understand,"" she said. ""And I'm ready to do whatever it takes.""

Kate looked at her for a moment, then a small smile tugged at the corners of her mouth. ""Alright, let's start with something simple,"" she said, trying to lighten the mood. ""I'm starving. Did you eat?""

Yelena shook her head, her own smile tentative. ""No,"" she admitted. ""I've been... preoccupied.""

SUMMARY^1: Kate hints at her willingness to move past the conflict, admitting she likes Yelena despite her actions. However, she makes it clear that trust must be earned and suggests they begin with a simple step: sharing a meal together.

""Well, let's fix that,"" Kate said, standing up. ""Let's order a pizza,"" she said, grabbing her phone to call. Yelena looked around the room, taking in the homely setting with a mix of curiosity and wonder.

""Pizza?"" Yelena perked up at the idea. It had been a long time since she'd indulged in such a simple pleasure. ""That sounds good,"" she said, a hint of excitement in her voice.

""Great,"" Kate said, already dialing the number. ""I know a place that makes the best pepperoni and mushroom.""

Yelena's eyes lit up at the mention of pepperoni, but she couldn't resist the urge to tease. ""How about pineapple?"" she suggested, her smile mischievous.

Kate's face contorted into an expression of mock horror. ""Ew! You like that,"" she said, her voice playfully disgusted.

Yelena's smile grew wider. ""It's good!"" she insisted. ""You'll see.""

Kate rolled her eyes but couldn't help the laugh that bubbled up. ""Fine,"" she said, her voice lightening. ""But we're splitting it half and half. I'm not going to be stuck with all your weird toppings.""

Yelena's smile grew into a grin. ""Deal,"" she said, leaning back into the couch. The tension in the room had eased, and for the first time in what felt like an eternity, she allowed herself to relax. The sound of Kate's laughter was surprisingly soothing, and she found herself feeling a strange sense of belonging in this unfamiliar place.

As Kate ordered the pizza, she mumbled something about at least it not being reindeer. Yelena's eyes widened in surprise before she burst out laughing, the sound echoing through the apartment. She had missed the camaraderie of having someone close. ""You Americans,"" she said, shaking her head. ""So picky about your pizzas.""

Kate feigned a look of offense, placing a hand dramatically over her heart. ""Hey, now,"" she said, her eyes sparkling with humor. ""Pineapple is a crime against humanity, okay?""

Yelena shrugged, still smiling. ""Your loss,"" she said. ""But I dare you to try it.""

Kate raised an eyebrow, the challenge accepted. ""Alright,"" she said, her voice light with amusement. ""But if it's as bad as I think, you're buying the next one.""

Yelena's smile grew at that, her touched by the suggestion that Kate would welcome her into her home again in the future, asking, ""Next one? We're want to do this again sometime?"", almost afraid of the answer.

Seeing the hesitation and hidden fear in Yelena's eyes and the smile she gave, Kate nodded, a genuine smile playing across her face. ""Of course,"" she said, her voice soft and reassuring. ""That's what friends do.""

The word 'friends' hung in the air, a promise that Yelena clung to like a lifeline. She had never truly had friends before, not in the way Kate and Clint did. Her life had been a series of missions and orders, loyalty, forced or otherwise, to a cause rather than people. The thought of sharing experiences and building memories that didn't involve bloodshed or deceit wasn't something she was used to as much, but it the amazing genuine girl extending her this olive branch made her hear swell and the pain of her life, of the loss of Natasha, she felt relief from it for the first time in months.

Kate turned away to grab plates and napkins from the kitchen, the silence between them no longer strained but filled with a cautious hope. Yelena took the opportunity to look around the apartment more fully, noticing the subtle details that made it Kate's - the bow and quiver leaning against the wall, the collection of comic books peeking out from a shelf, the fridge covered in sticky notes and reminders. It was a stark contrast to the sterile, utilitarian spaces she was accustomed to, and she found it oddly comforting.

When Kate returned with the plates and a bottle of soda, she caught Yelena's gaze and offered a small smile. ""It's not much, but it's home,"" she said with a little awkward playfulness, setting everything down on the coffee table.

Yelena nodded, her eyes still wide with wonder. ""It's... perfect,"" she said, the simplicity of the word belying the depth of her feelings.

""Minus the burn damage,"" Kate quipped, her eyes twinkling with mischief. Yelena couldn't help but laugh at Kate's quick wit, the sound echoing through the apartment. It was the first time she had felt genuine amusement in weeks, and it felt surprisingly liberating.

As they settled onto the couch to wait, Kate couldn't help but cast a sideways glance at Yelena. The assassin's eyes were still wide with wonder at the mundane details of her life, and Kate felt a pang of something she hadn't expected: pity. It was strange, feeling sorry for someone who had tried to kill the person who was her hero. But there was a sadness in Yelena that was impossible to ignore, a loneliness that resonated deep within Kate.

The conversation flowed easily from there, the two of them finding common ground in their shared experiences and the absurdity of their situation. As they waited for the pizza to arrive, they swapped stories about their respective lives, their laughter filling the apartment. Yelena told Kate about her time in the Red Room, her voice devoid of self-pity but filled with a quiet resilience that Kate couldn't help but admire. In turn, Kate talked about her own training, her love for archery, and the moments that had led her to want to be Hawkeye's protégé.

The pizza arrived, and they settled in front of the TV with their plates, the aroma of cheese and baked dough filling the air. The silence between them was no longer uncomfortable but rather filled with an easy companionship that had begun to form. Yelena took a bite of her half, savoring the sweetness of the pineapple and the tang of the tomato sauce, offering Kate a bite, which she in playful begrudging accepted. To Kate's surprise, she found it quite enjoyable, but she kept her opinion to herself, not wanting to give Yelena bragging rights.",1,1744851004.0,u_Dagenspear,0,1.0,False

Sabrina Carpenterused a variation from the intro to the movie Grease at her show. This fits with her previous performances of ""Hopelessly Devoted to You"", a classic from Grease, which she did on her own tour and repeatedly while opening on The Eras Tour.

# November 18th - Taylor Swift en Mexico con 3 Blue Birds: Coming Soon

What is coming soon? We never learned. Taylor's post was deleted shortly after it was posted. On r/gaylorswift, we discussed this at the time in relation to many things. One of the ones that I most remember (for obvious reasons) is the linkage it has to Harry Styles' song Daylight and to Midnight Rain.

# Daylight - If I was a blue bird, I'd be flying home to you

This is an image from Harry's song Daylight. After Harry released this video two years ago, he went stopped preforming and has only been seen in strategic PR stunts (Lyme bikes, with James Coden, bearding with Taylor Russell) and has not preformed with anyone other than Stevie Nicks. The jist of the song is that Harry is a yellow bird, the only one of his kind, surrounded by blue Birds. He can't fly home to his love because he's not a blue Bird, he's a yellow bird and it is not acceptable for yellow birds to be with other yellow birds. To state that more simply, a boy (yellow bird) can't be with his lover (another yellow bird) because the boy (Harry) is not a blue Bird (a female) - being gay isn't okay. [Here is the link if you'd like to watch the actual video; there are many, many, mass movement connections.](https://youtu.be/-UJCMfuFtSQ?si=bmWB01-GhTBurr8_)

# Daylight's Grease Blue Birds

Prior to Harry releasing his official video, the only video that existed was created by James Corden's team. It was the only video for Daylight for a long time, until Harry released his own video. This video also has the Grease birds in it.

# Hopelessly Devoted to You

From here, we go into Harry's performance of Hopelessly Devoted to You. This was for HarryWeen. The following year, Harry dressed as Dorothy. Grease is Louis Tomlinson's favourite musical and he has played Danny previously. I don't have it at hand, but there is a video of Harry changing the lyrics to ""hopelessly devoted to Lou"" when he sings it. So, two people close to Taylor have made this song part of their setlist for a time. I know its a popular song, but it's notable...

Harry also has two swallows tattooed on his chest. One bird is larger than the other and both birds have eyebrows that are differently shaped - one is arched and one is more flat. Birds don't have eyebrows, so this was an inentional choice. Harry and Louis have matching eyebrows and Louis is around 5'7"" while Harry is around 6'

# ""(There'll Be Bluebirds Over) The White Cliffs of Dover"" 

u/materialtangelo9856 shared this song and posited that it is related to the theme of Blue Birds + Mass Movement of Joy as it is fantasizing about the end of WWII. It was composed in 1941 by [Walter Kent](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Kent) to lyrics by Nat Burton and it's famous in the UK and is one of the more popular songs from WWII.

**September 17th, 2019**

Thanking again my date queens, u/materialtangelo9856 identified that we are currently at September 17th, 2019 in Taylor Time. This is when Lover Fest was being announced. 

**Easter Sunday (April 20, 2025) = September 21, 2019** 

On this date in Taylor time, u/courtingdisaster reports that Taylor announced that she wouldn’t sing at the Melbourne Cup, the biggest horse race (yuck) in Australia. The race is called, “The Race That Stops The Nation”. The Bolter, if you'd like to phrase it another way? The aforementioned queen made sure to point out that Melbourne was when Taylor started doing mashups on The Eras Tour.

As u/materialtangelo9856 pointed out, the first mashup was Getaway Car + August +  The Other Side of the Door. u/_lacespace pointed out that this all fits with ""the horse bit stuff"" from the past year or so, with u/courtingdisaster pointing out that in Miss Americana she talked about taking of her muzzle. Yes, dear reader, horses can be muzzled.

# Meet Me at Midnight: When the clock strikes twelve...

Cinderella was assisted by her Blue Bird friends throughout the Disney film. While the birds don't speak words, they sing and their songs convey a great deal of personality - the blue birds are kind and caring, invested in helping Cinderella. 

At midnight, when the clock struck twelve, Cinderella's fairy godmother's magic faded and we met her as she was...just a girl...

And it felt very freeing to do, so I’m gonna post my entry to hopefully help someone else, if they can relate to it or feel that it would help them to do the same ❤️

I don’t love myself, as a person even. And that’s okay: it’s ok for me to feel the ways I do: it’s ok for me to be sad it’s ok for me to be depressed and overwhelmed and anxious and stressed snd hate myself and having ruminations and it’s ok for me to be isolating and scared and it’s ok for me to binge eat an entire bag of chips and to be slightly chubbier than I have been my whole life before.

It’s ok if I don’t find the perfect therapist: it’s ok that I ghosted people, it’s ok that I have perfectionism and ocd. It’s ok to not know who I am or if my reality is real or not: its okay for me to exaggerate the truth to make sure that I don’t get invalidated for my problems not being bad enough, it’s ok for me to feel scared to trust people it’s ok for me to discount all of the positives that happen and how far I’ve come. It’s ok for me to beat myself up every single day, it’s ok for me to have yellow teeth and to not do my notes on time. It’s ok for me to eat nothing or eat everything. It’s ok for my diabetes to be all over the place. It’s ok for me to have horrible gut health. And to do enemas and to not look at my cat every second of the day so that she doesn’t hate me: its ok for me to fawn my cat, it’s ok for me to leave her home for awhile while I go have fun. It’s ok to be obsessed with work and to feel drained and like I’m not doing enough every single day. It’s ok for me to think I’m fat and ugly. It’s okay for me to be watching the same shows over and over and being scared to try new things: it’s okay for me to have coffee even when it makes me feel insane. It’s okay for me to want to move to another country and idealize about it: it’s ok for me to picture that I would fall in love with him even if it never happens. And to obsess about it for months even though he is abusive. It’s okay for me to never sing even though I got singing lessons for two years. It’s okay for me to be too scared to do anything in my life: it’s okay to feel everything and nothing at the same time: it’s ok for me to love sociopaths and narcissists and borderlines even though it would be such horrible toxic relationships. It’s okay for me to constantly berate my appearance; and it’s okay for me to not take in and accept compliments from people. It’s okay for me to be a people pleaser and work so many hours for free. It’s okay that I have lied and fabricated in my life. It’s okay that I don’t have any close friends.

It’s ok for me to get Botox and lip filler: it’s okay for me to still see mom and get triggered by it and still go and feel like I’m dying all the time: it’s ok to laugh about people’s trauma with them: it’s okay to not be perfect all the time. It’s okay to dissociate all the time and have my nervous system triggered and give too much insulin and keep cutting my hair and be triggered by everything and blame myself for everything. It’s okay to blame myself for everything.  Its okay to blame myself for everything ❤️It’s okay to never have a perfectly clean house.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The Haden kettle stands out due to a combination of aesthetic appeal and functional design elements.

**Capacity:** The Haden kettle typically boasts a generous capacity, usually around 1.7 liters. This is ideal for households that frequently brew multiple cups of tea or coffee at once. The large capacity reduces the need for frequent refills, saving time and energy. This makes it a convenient option for both individual users and larger families.

**Materials and Build Quality:** Haden kettles are often constructed from high-quality stainless steel, ensuring durability and resistance to rust and corrosion. The exterior finishes range from enamel to powder coating, providing a variety of stylish color options to match any kitchen d茅cor. The use of BPA-free materials in the interior ensures that the water remains pure and uncontaminated.

**Rapid Boil Technology:** One of the key features of the Haden kettle is its rapid boil technology. This allows water to be heated quickly and efficiently, often boiling a full kettle in under 5 minutes. This feature is especially beneficial for busy individuals who need hot water on demand. The rapid boil functionality is achieved through a powerful heating element that distributes heat evenly throughout the kettle.

**Automatic Shut-Off and Boil-Dry Protection:** Safety is a paramount concern, and Haden kettles incorporate several features to ensure user safety. The automatic shut-off feature turns off the kettle once the water has reached boiling point, preventing over-boiling and potential hazards. The boil-dry protection feature automatically shuts off the kettle if there is insufficient water, preventing damage to the heating element and reducing the risk of fire.

**Design and Aesthetics:** Haden kettles are renowned for their retro-inspired designs and vibrant color palettes. These kettles are not only functional appliances but also stylish additions to any kitchen countertop. The ergonomic handles and easy-to-pour spouts enhance the user experience, making them both practical and visually appealing.

**Ease of Use and Maintenance:** Haden kettles are designed with user convenience in mind. The removable limescale filter makes cleaning and maintenance simple, preventing the buildup of mineral deposits that can affect the taste of the water and the kettle's performance. The wide opening allows for easy filling and cleaning.

**Improved Convenience:** The rapid boil technology significantly reduces the time it takes to heat water, making it convenient for busy mornings or quick beverage preparation. With a Haden kettle, users can enjoy a hot cup of tea or coffee in a matter of minutes, without the lengthy wait times associated with traditional stovetop kettles. This added convenience can be a significant time-saver for individuals with demanding schedules.

**Enhanced Safety:** The automatic shut-off and boil-dry protection features provide peace of mind, ensuring that the kettle operates safely and reliably. Users can leave the kettle unattended without worrying about potential hazards, such as over-boiling or damage to the heating element. This enhanced safety makes Haden kettles a suitable choice for households with children or elderly individuals.

**Stylish Design:** The retro-inspired designs and vibrant color options add a touch of elegance to any kitchen d茅cor. A Haden kettle is not just a functional appliance but also a stylish statement piece that complements the overall aesthetic of the kitchen. This can enhance the visual appeal of the kitchen and create a more inviting and aesthetically pleasing environment.

Regular cleaning prevents the buildup of mineral deposits that can affect the taste of the water and the kettle's performance. The wide opening allows for easy access to the interior of the kettle, making it simple to remove any debris or buildup.

**Durability and Longevity:** The high-quality stainless steel construction ensures that the Haden kettle is durable and resistant to rust and corrosion. This means that the kettle will last for years to come, providing reliable performance and value for money. The robust construction also ensures that the kettle can withstand daily use without showing signs of wear and tear.

1k1075w,https://i.redd.it/z0z0myx0jave1.png,Im an owner of a cannabis dispensary and i may be closing down,"**Hey Reddit, I’m Issac — owner of Black Lotus Hemporium, a new dispensary here in San Antonio. We've been open for about 2 months now, and I wanted to share my experience so far — not as an ad, but just from one human to another.**

I opened this shop not just because cannabis is a fast-moving and liquid business — but because I’ve seen the *real* difference it can make. Over the last 3 years, I’ve worked with people dealing with anxiety, insomnia, depression, PTSD, and chronic pain — especially elderly folks and veterans. And I’ve seen how much cannabis can help improve their quality of life.

What I *haven’t* seen enough of is consistency, transparency, or a safe space where people from all walks of life (ages 21+) can feel comfortable shopping for their wellness needs. A lot of people are still getting their products from the black market, where there's zero accountability or quality control. I wanted to create something different.

At **Black Lotus**, we’re focused on more than just selling flower or carts — we care deeply about *how* people access this plant. Safe, legal, friendly, and stigma-free.

But here’s the problem… marketing a legal cannabis business in Texas is *hard*. Even though we’re operating 100% within the law (thank you, 2018 Farm Bill + THCA loophole), we’re still stuck in a gray area when it comes to promoting what we do. So far, the most effective strategy has been standing outside with a “**FREE WEED**” sign just to catch attention from passing traffic. It’s honestly worked — and we’ve met some amazing people that way who’ve become regulars — but it only goes so far.

We’ve invested a lot into our space. It’s not your typical smoke shop — it’s clean, spacious, and designed more like a boutique than a headshop. I’ve got big plans, too:  
☕️ A coffee shop inside the dispensary  
🧩 Hosting local vendors who sell vintage, collectibles, handmade goods, or offer services like tattoos, piercings, and massages  
🎨 Building a space that feels more like a *community* than a store

I’m not here to sell anything right now — I’m just sharing my journey. If you're in the industry, curious about THCA, or just want to connect, feel free to drop a comment or DM me. I want to help shape the cannabis culture here into something mature, welcoming, and real.

Thanks for reading if you made it this far — and thank you to Reddit for giving people like me a platform to speak directly to the community. 🙏

Stay safe, stay kind, and keep building.

I want to build a reliable hybrid system that can run mostly off solar but also plug into the grid when needed.

* A 9,000 BTU mini split (for cooling, especially in summer)
* A laptop/workstation
* Interior lights and basic electronics
* Occasional small appliances like a coffee maker

I want the system to be solid and reliable, ideally able to run the mini split for extended hours on hot days. Budget is around $5–6K, but I’m open if it’s worth going slightly higher for a better setup.

* How many panels I’d realistically need
* What kind of batteries/inverter/charge controller would work best
* Any must-know tips or brands I should consider (or avoid)

By cutting out the foods that trigger anger symptoms, and/or adding calcium supplementation, I've fixed all uncontrolled anger feelings and remained that way after dropping my medication (quetiapine) which caused some horrible side effects. I've ordered DAO supplement as well to try it soon.

Some people in this sub recommended fasting for a day to finally fix being able to fall asleep again. I haven't fallen asleep at night for 17 days in a row, but insomnia has been going on for years. So I fasted for 28h45m the first time, but to no avail. I'm up 4 hours after going to bed, again not having slept at all yet. My sleep is normally worse in summer for me, but last summer, it just stayed bad and is now at the worst level ever.

Did anyone find relief after together with fighting HIT? How long did it take you?

P.S. The trigger foods I found until now, statistically, are: all nuts, avocado, bananas, eggs, tea, coffee (even decaf), maybe strawberries (relate only to bad sleep for me). I'm very fine with tomatoes, meat, fish and gluten since they have a positive effect. Also tried a high-carnivore, ketogenic diet to no avail so I guess it's specific foods. During this fasting day, I reached significant ketone levels for the first time (blood sugar 96 mg/dl = 5.3 mmol/L, ketones 0.9 mmol/L, GKI 5.9) which at least gives me a success for prolonged fasting.

My friend is 25F and a teacher, she works at the other side of the country and I hadn't seen her since Christmas.


She's been with her bf (34M, let's call him Ian) for a little over a year now. I knew they had minor issues (she called them like that, without mentioning any further information) since some time now. Yesterday she was about to go to his house to spend the day together before she returned to her hometown for Easter holidays (it's Orthodox Easter now). He called her a few minutes before she was about to arrive at his house and asked her to get him bottled water from the supermarket (6 x 1,5L) but she accidentally picked up sparkling water without noticing (girl was walking a 45 minute walk to go to his house). When she finally went to his house Ian started yelling at her, poor girl told me her hands and back hurt because of the weight she carried and he wasn't even nice enough to excuse the mistake. He made her return the water after yelling and being mean to her for 10 minutes straight. When she returned to his house she couldn't help it and cry and he didn't even bother apologising for his manners, he only said ""you're a 25 year old woman, stop crying"".


Second part of their afternoon. She told me that after calming down a bit they made love twice and then he dumped her for one and a half hour straight alone in bed while he was trying to fix some settings on his gaming PC (Ian is an avid gamer). She was telling him that he has all of the next days available to do anything he wanted on his PC and the time they had together was valuable and also that she missed him because the past few weeks they weren't seeing eachother much (something for which he was whining and crying to her for days as she told me afterwards). And he responded ""What, you want us to be literally stuck onto eachother ? I want to finish this"". She felt very bad and just layed there in bed til he finally finished with his bs and went to lay next to her, while asking ""did my little baby miss me ?"". After that he started (really randomly) telling her that he wants her to change the style of her eyebrows because ""he didn't like them and they're really thick"". My friend is gorgeous (I ain't exaggerating) and one of the most naturally beautiful people I know. She then told him that she loves her brows the way they are and he said ""But I'm going to like you more if you change them"". Then he attacked her personal dressing style and told her they need to go shopping together because he doesn't like her style ""it's too athletic and I want you more elegant"" and also that he always dresses well and her style doesn't match his and of course that ""he is going to like her more if she dresses the way he likes"".


She cried again after this and told him to take her home. She slept there and returned to her hometown today where we met for a coffee. Am I wrong for wanting to interfere and even talk to a family member of hers about her toxic relationship ? Since I know she won't be telling anyone and I feel like this guy is just poisoning her heart and soul.",2,1744849911.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

I had to do that even though I still loved it...,"Since the beginning, when I met my ex, she used to invite me over to eat cake with her and her friends. After a while, we started doing video calls, but she never wanted to show her face — she always said her hair was messy. Later on, I found out, according to her, that she had autism.

Our conversations were usually one-sided. We had planned to meet at the park, but she canceled, saying she had hurt her leg. At some point, she told me that I was treating her differently after she confessed her autism. She also told me her ex had abandoned her, and that another guy she was seeing had replaced her.

One day, after I was mugged and almost lost her number, I noticed she didn’t really care; she was quite indifferent and even said she wouldn’t text me unless I texted her first. She used to talk about her cats and how her nephews were also autistic. I remember she got really upset once when her cousin mentioned she used to drink with her ex.

Later on, I invited her to go to the movies, especially since she kept saying we never went out. At first, she said no because she was too shy, but after some insistence, she agreed. However, the next day she asked: ""Wouldn't it be better if we were just friends?""

In the end, we still went to the movies, met up there, bought candy, kissed during the film, and spent the whole afternoon acting like a couple. She was always very private, never letting me see her phone, and she only gave me her Instagram after we broke up.

Another time, we went to the mall, she bought me chocolate, and we ended up going to a motel. Once we got there, she said she was too shy and didn't want the lights on. I told her it was fine, but she quickly became distant and her mood changed. After that, we went home.

I remember another day, after hanging out in the park and acting all couple-like, I offered to walk her home. It felt strange because she always made it very clear that she didn’t want me to meet her family.

There was also this one time when her sister dropped her off at my place. I mentioned that we barely went out because she was always making excuses, and she got extremely mad at me that day.

One time, we played a game together, and when I criticized the game, she got upset and stopped playing. Afterward, she brought me chocolate, we spent time together, and soon after, she told me she wanted to break up.

She invited me to a party, said she wanted me to go with her, then later said she wasn't going, and then changed her mind again. I got frustrated and asked if she actually wanted me there. I decided to go and asked if I could arrive earlier, but she clearly told me to only show up at 6 PM.

When I arrived a bit earlier, her sister saw me on the street and invited me in. Later, we went to her friend's party, and she introduced me as her boyfriend. At one point, out of nowhere, she said: ""Shall we download an app to find you a hot girl?""

After that, we went to her place, and she wanted me to stay over, but I ended up going home.

After all these ups and downs, I called her and broke up. She started crying and blocked me. Later, she told me I had sent her into therapy (CAPS) and said I had taken away her happiness. Not long after, she texted me saying she missed me more than she thought she would.

We started talking again, and during one of our conversations, I found her on a dating app. When I confronted her, she told me to just find someone else. I got mad, and she claimed she was only looking for her friend's ex.

In the end, I confessed I loved her, and she replied that the feeling would pass. She said she went somewhere and wished I had been there. Not long after, she called inviting me to her mother's birthday party, but I didn't go. Later, her mom called asking if I loved her, and then even invited me over for coffee.

We started talking again, but then she told me her father was furious with me. I felt terrible and vented about it online. When she saw it, she said I had used and deceived her, that she only acted that way because of her insecurity and her autism, and that she had prayed for me every day. Then she blocked me and vanished.",3,1744849826.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

Hi there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me. 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. I won’t bring any drama into your life. 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. I am seeking a woman that is in her late 20s thats 25+ please to early 30s  please. Maturity is a big thing for me in someone too. 

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy that loves talking on voice chat. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use bad language vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love o have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after. 

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test. I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I don’t work at the moment please be okay with all of this from the get go I’ve had terrible trouble trying to find suitable jobs but I have got plans for the future for things I’m not lazy or anything like that. I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work as I said. 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe.

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

She was this small, mixed race of indian and chinese, magnificent looking woman that stood out in a cohort of 500 people. However we didnt have any meaningful interactions till a year later and we hit it off instantly since then. For context I look really mediocre and thats why I couldn’t believe myself the day I confessed my feelings and she mentioned she had feelings for me as well. Maybe having some jokes under your sleeves does give a you chance with the out of your leagues I guess.

She was my first everything, and I was like her 3rd relationship but she was never was in a really serious relationship before me as well. Safe to say be both took each other’s V-card. Our relationship had its ups and downs but with each issue we just got stronger, learnt to set boundaries and expectations, compromised when needed and fast forward 6 years later and here we are.

Coming to the issue in hand, our intimacy life was great in the beginning, we used to do stuffs so sporadically, both being so passionate about it, and while we didnt do it so often I wouldnt say it was rare as-well, probably about once a week. However this started becoming an issue about 3 years ago, when she started having pain during intimacy. While I know its normal to have some pain but what she experienced was painful enough that she was physically unable to continue. This however wasnt too often so we weren’t too concerned at that time, but we did consult a gynaecologist, who basically told she is just young and she will grow out of it. I however think something else is going on but I will come back to this after. Right after this, we both graduated from our university and decided to start our working career in the UK as the working environment back at our country is the most toxic bs I have ever seen and the UK seemed like a better option.

But things have been getting worse and worse since, to a point that sometimes when I hint my girlfriend that maybe we can do something that night she will just smile or say something like ‘Lets see’ , but deep down I know she is worried about how painful would it be.

Before you guys judge me, I never force myself onto her, or more precisely, never bring up intimacy after the first hint she gives me she does not feel like it today. That being said, here is my issue , I had expressed that the issue here might need some looking into and she agreed but told me she will seek medical help when she returns to our home country for the holidays as the waiting time for non-urgent care in the UK is too long. This was 3 years ago and she had gone home 4 times since but she has never been to see a gynaecologist, even though she had enough time for this but she decided to just rot in her house instead.

Instead of getting professional help, she comes up with her own reasons on why the pain is there, such as not enough foreplay, needs intimate contact through out the day before intimacy. I complied to these request and try all of them but we end up running into the same issues again.

About a year ago, things started to change but not for the better. My girlfriend started agreeing to all my request for intimacy, and when we do it, it will be very obvious that she is in pain with the faces she makes but she denies it if I asked but instead just rushes me to finish quickly. This was really putting me off, as I started feeling that I was forcing myself onto her, eventhough she had fully consented for it. When I talked to her about this she initially denied that she was in pain but after a couple more times of this happening, I ended the intercourse the moment i realised she was in pain and told her I cant do it. She finally came clean that she was forcing herself to make me finish as she feels like an incomplete woman if she cant meet my sexual needs. I made it clear thats never the case and while I understand her thoughts behind it, intercourse is not about one or the other finishing but its the connection and love between us. I told her that I am not going have intimacy with her if the whole this a just a fake show to please me.

This is where I would like to bring a thought of mine, but again I am no professional so I am not diagnosing anything, but I strongly believe the reason behind her symptoms are not physical but psychological. My GF has had a troubled childhood and she always told me no one has ever taken care of her like I did, which believe it or not, is the same case on my side as well. My GF is a person who stressed out alot on minute things, and things has only gotten worse since coming to the UK and the stress of being adults, away from home and working for the first time and seeing the reality of the world on our own. This made her usually pre-occupied with them, such as cases seen at work, whether she did the right thing, and how things could go wrong. This made her priotise her work alot to a point that she leaves to work 1 hour early and usually leave 1-2 hours late and she tends to overwork herself to prove herself to the seniors at work. This does come with a cost tho, she barely eats at work despite working so hard which had led her to losing so much weight that she looks like a skeleton with skin on. Apart from that, the only things i hear from her after work are work related stuffs and her ranting on either colleagues or the system itself. I have told her that we should keep work related stuffs at work and should just focus on ourselves after work. This will work for a day or two but we will go back to where we were. Recently her dog had died due to cancer ( RIP), and during this grieving period, she told me she was going bald as part of her religious belief. While I had no issues with her going bald, I still dont, I just wasnt a very religious guy, so I just expressed that I dont think thats necessary but she went on with it anyways but I dont blame her as it gives her mental peace, or atleast I thought, as after going bald, I noticed she doesnt leave our home so often and stopped dressing up as she does normally. I always asked if everything is fine and she usually just shrugs it off but after me asking her a few more times she opened up saying he self esteem is low after she went bald and doesnt feel like she is attracted to herself anymore. I tried reassuring her that she lookes as beautiful now as she was before going bald but as you guessed it that didnt help at all. The reason why I am telling this because I believe all her mental stress had led to her libido becoming almost not existent and tbh I cant remember when was the last time she initiated anything. This woman used to be so active in the bedroom, or outside, and even if intimacy did not happen, there used so much of touch and love from her initiation that is almost non existent now.


Fast forward a few months, we probably had sex about 3-4 times the whole of last year , and here is where everything blew up. My girlfriend just came back from her trip back home ( I couldn’t go because I couldn’t get my annual leaves fml) and once again she did not seek any medical help while being there. She did initiate intimacy ( huge thing as she almost never does this nowadays) that night, but again we were in the same issue despite taking all previous measures discussed. I just stopped midway, cleaned myself and went to sleep. The next day while we were having our morning coffee, she brought up what happened last night and I was just mainly ignoring it or talking around it as I didnt want to sound like a guy that only cares about sex, but at one point she mentioned “ I am just not sure whats going on” and something just burst in my head and I just started berating her. I told her that she never cared about it anyways, and if she ever did she would have atleast put the efforts it to get it sorted. I told her it might be an issue that we might never find a resolve but the more pressing issue is that she doesn’t even care about or had tried seeking any help regarding it all. The issue is she can spend a whole weekend stressing about something minute that happened at work but couldn’t give a duck about what my concerns are. I told her its not just about the sex, but any bit of intimate touch or love is almost not there anymore in this relationship or atleast from her side.

She was silent for awhile and then started crying. She asked me why havent I told her that this affected me so much, to which I reiterated that I have told her nicely alot of times before but she never bothered about until the pot was boiling over now. This is when she told me thag last time she had anybit of libido was more than a year ago and she had only faked everything, even the one last night, for my pleasure. This absolutely shattered me and I just sat in silence for awhile, then I just told her that from that day onwards I would not be initiating any intimacy and if we are ever to have any it will be on her initiation,then just stood up and went about my day. Since then I have been giving her the cold shoulder, only talking when necessary, sleeping in the guest room. She did try to have intimacy with me the very next day but I just shut it off as it came off completely fake and like she is just trying to patch things up without addressing the main issue.

She since has booked an appointment with a private gynaecologist that is in like 2 weeks time but is still taking slow efforts to mend things. We are talking normally now but there seems to be a barrier between us now that we both are ignoring for the time being. This blow up had made me feel really distant, craving for love, someone to talk to, someone who can hug me tightly, but I just dont feel like I can get it from my GF anymore as anything she does, either genuinely or not ,seems forced to me and I absolutely hate it. I dont want to break up. I love this woman. I have been saving and will continue to save for the next year till I can afford the wedding that she always wanted. I want to children with her. I want to grow old with her. I want her to be last face I see before I die. But with all this i feel hollow now, like I feel nothing for her. I dont want to cheat and any thoughts about cheating hasnt crossed my mind, but seeing other couples being so in love just makes defeated knowing I might never feel that in my life. I dont want to leave her but I dont know what should I do to fix this. I think I just had vent out somewhere and probably seek advice from you guys regarding this. Sorry for the long post but I have no family(abusive and detached but thats a story for another day) and my friends are all mutual friends with my GF and I dont want air out our personal issues to them. Any suggestions on what I can do to save this guys? as great in the beginning, we used to do stuffs so sporadically, both being so passionate about it, and while we didnt do it so often I wouldnt say it was rare as-well, probably about once a week.

However I wanna make alterations to make it richer in flavor, substituting milk for water, adding melted chocolate, a little bit of coffee, the normal tips for ""elevating"" the flavor 

I do know how the magic✨ behind chocoflan works, the cake mix is less dense thanks to the baking soda, and therefore the flan sinks despite pouring it on top.

Would adding additional ingredients cause it too mix? Ngl I wouldn't mind that much, I've had those failed ones and they're pretty good, but this is for a birthday.

If so should I add more baking soda? For additional info, the mix I'm using is Betty Crocker's devil food. 

Also I'm not taking suggestions about just putting the flan first and baking it, I'd rather do it the hard way. ",2,1744849425.0,AskBaking,2,1.0,False

# Best Water Bottle Dispensers of 2025: Reviews & Comparisons for Commercial Use

Staying hydrated is essential, especially in commercial environments.Maintaining well-being of staff and patrons is key, whether it's in an office, restaurant, school, gym, or commercial building. The right **water bottle dispenser** facilitates this, encouraging greater water consumption and contributing to a healthier, more productive surroundings. As we look ahead to 2025, advancements in technology, design, and hygiene make selecting the perfect dispenser more important than ever. this guide provides an in-depth look at the market, considering various business needs and comparing top models for commercial use. If you are in the market for a **commercial water dispenser**,read on!

## Why Invest in a Water Bottle Dispenser?

Before diving into specific models,let's consider the compelling reasons to invest in a quality water bottle dispenser in your establishment.

   **Health and Well-being:** Providing accessible, clean water promotes hydration, improving employee focus, productivity, and overall well-being. dehydration can lead to fatigue, headaches, and decreased cognitive function, impacting job performance. for restaurants, providing a convenient water option for patrons adds to the overall dining experience. In schools and gyms, encouraging hydration is crucial for students and members alike.

   **Cost Savings:** While there's an initial investment, switching from bottled water to a **filtered water dispenser** or **bottleless water cooler** significantly reduces long-term costs. Eliminating the need to purchase and store individual water bottles translates to considerable savings over time, and also freeing up storage. Purchasing managers will appreciate the reduction in recurring costs.

   **Environmental Responsibility:** Reducing reliance on single-use plastic bottles demonstrates a commitment to sustainability. Offering a **water bottle refill station** encourages the use of reusable bottles, minimizing plastic waste and enhancing your company's or organization's image as environmentally conscious. Schools especially can promote eco-friendly practices among their students.

   **Enhanced Hygiene:** Modern water bottle dispensers offer superior hygiene features, such as touchless operation and antimicrobial surfaces. These advancements are notably important in preventing the spread of germs and maintaining a clean and safe environment. A **touchless water dispenser** will especially be desirable in environments where multiple people will be using it.

   **Increased Convenience:** A readily available water source eliminates the need for employees, customers, or students to leave the premises to purchase bottled water. This saves time and promotes a more efficient workflow, and keeps everyone happy.

## Types of Water Bottle Dispensers for Commercial Use

Choosing the right type of water bottle dispenser depends on your specific needs and environment. Understanding the options is the first step in making an informed decision.

   **Bottleless Water Coolers (Point-of-Use Water Dispensers):** These dispensers connect directly to your building's water line. Water is filtered on demand, providing a continuous supply of clean drinking water. **bottleless water coolers** are ideal for high-traffic areas like offices,restaurants,and schools because there's no need to replace heavy bottles. Also known as point-of-use water dispensers.

*   **Bottled Water Coolers:** These traditional dispensers use pre-filled water bottles. While they offer flexibility in terms of placement (no water line connection needed), they require ongoing bottle replacements and storage space.*   **Water Bottle Filling Stations:** Ofen wall-mounted or freestanding, these stations are designed specifically for refilling water bottles. They typically offer a rapid fill rate and hygienic features such as touchless sensors and antimicrobial surfaces. A **water bottle filling station** is a great option for schools, gyms and airports where the primary goal is swift refills.

   **Wall Mounted Water Dispensers:** These units are mounted directly to the wall. Perfect for saving space, but require professional installation including plumbing. These are a good choice for locations where floor space is limited.

   **Free Standing Water Dispensers:** The most popular, these units can be placed anywhere there is access to electricity and, for some models, a water line.

   **Countertop Water Dispensers:** Smaller and more compact, countertop models are suitable for areas with limited space. They can be bottleless or rely on smaller water jugs.

## Key Features to Consider When Choosing a Dispenser

Beyond the type of dispenser, several key features should influence your decision.

   **Filtration System:** The quality of the filtration system is crucial.Look for dispensers with multi-stage filtration that removes sediment,chlorine,lead,and other contaminants. Many **water dispenser with filtration** options are available, each with different filter types.

   **capacity and Flow Rate:** Consider the number of people who will be using the dispenser and choose a model with adequate capacity and flow rate to meet their needs. Restaurants and gyms require higher capacity than small offices.

   **Temperature Options:** Some dispensers offer cold, hot, and room temperature water. A **hot and cold water dispenser** can be a valuable addition to offices and restaurants, providing options for tea, coffee, and instant soups.

   **Hygiene Features:** Touchless sensors, antimicrobial surfaces, and self-cleaning functions minimize the risk of contamination. An **ADA compliant water dispenser** is important for accessibility.

   **Durability and Maintenance:** Look for a **durable water bottle dispenser** made from high-quality materials that can withstand heavy use. Easy maintenance and readily available replacement parts are also essential. Consider a **reliable water bottle dispenser** from a reputable brand.

   **ADA Compliance:** Ensure the dispenser meets accessibility standards, allowing people with disabilities to use it easily. An **ADA compliant water dispenser** is essential for inclusivity.

   **Energy Efficiency:** Choose an energy-efficient model to minimize electricity consumption and reduce operating costs.

   **Aesthetics:** Select a dispenser that complements your environment's décor. Modern,sleek designs are available to enhance the overall look of your space. This is especially important in customer-facing areas like restaurants and gyms.

## Top Water Bottle Dispenser Recommendations for 2025

While predicting the exact top models for 2025 is impossible, we can highlight brands and features that are likely to be prominent. Remember to check for updated consumer reports and professional reviews closer to the actual purchase date for current models and specifications.

**For Offices:** Consider bottleless water coolers with advanced filtration and touchless operation. Models from brands like Elkay offer excellent filtration and hygiene features.

**For Restaurants:** Opt for high-capacity dispensers with both hot and cold water options. Models with stainless steel construction and easy-to-clean surfaces are ideal. Consider a water bottle refilling station in a customer service area.

**For Schools:** Choose durable,vandal-resistant water bottle filling stations with antimicrobial surfaces and ADA compliance. Elkay and Halsey Taylor are well-regarded brands in this sector.

**For Gyms/Fitness Centers:** focus on high-capacity, fast-fill water bottle filling stations with a focus on cold water. A sleek, aesthetically pleasing design is also a plus.

**Specific Features to Look For (Across All Categories):**

   **Advanced filtration:** Look for multi-stage filtration systems that remove lead, chlorine, bacteria, and viruses.
   **Touchless Operation:** Highly desirable for hygiene.
   **Antimicrobial Surfaces:** Help prevent the spread of germs.
   **Remote monitoring:** Some models offer remote monitoring of water quality and usage, allowing for proactive maintenance.
   **Leak Detection:** Prevents water damage and wasted water.
   **NSF Certification:** Ensures the dispenser meets strict safety and performance standards.

## Considerations for Different Audience Segments

Let's revisit our target audience segments and tailor recommendations based on their specific needs and search intent.

**office Managers:** Looking for cost-effective and hygienic hydration solutions. Focus on bottleless water coolers with good filtration, ease of maintenance, and cost savings. Total cost of ownership should be a key factor in the decision.

**Restaurant Owners/Managers:** Need a high-capacity, durable, and hygienic water dispensing solution. Prioritize robust models with easy-to-clean surfaces and both hot and cold water options. Hygiene is paramount.

**School Administrators:** Concerned with providing students with clean and accessible drinking water while promoting reusable water bottles.Prioritize durable, vandal-resistant, and ADA-compliant water bottle filling stations. Promote hydration and reduce plastic waste.

**Gym/Fitness Center Owners:** Want to provide members with convenient access to chilled water while encouraging the use of personal water bottles. Focus on durable, high-capacity, and aesthetically pleasing water bottle filling stations with rapid fill rates.

**building Managers (Commercial):** Responsible for facilities management and tenant satisfaction. Seek reliable water dispenser solutions that require minimal maintenance, meet accessibility standards, and potentially integrate with existing building infrastructure.

**architects/Designers:** Designing new buildings or renovations.Need specifications, CAD drawings, and BIM models for water bottle fillers and dispensers. Focus on ADA compliance, installation requirements, and integration with overall building design.

**Purchasing Managers:** Find the best deals on bulk purchases including water bottle dispensers. Focus on price, features, warranty, and total cost of ownership. Comparison shop and negotiate the best terms.## Installation and Maintenance

Proper installation and maintenance are crucial for ensuring the longevity and optimal performance of your water bottle dispenser.

   **Installation:** Bottleless water coolers require professional plumbing installation. Wall-mounted units also necessitate professional installation including plumbing hookup. Bottled water coolers are relatively easy to install, requiring only a power outlet. The **dispenser for water bottles** can be installed by most, as typically it does not need professional installation. Carefully follow the manufacturer's instructions.

   **Filtration System Maintenance:** Regularly replace filters according to the manufacturer's recommendations. This ensures optimal water quality and prevents damage to the dispenser.

   **Cleaning and Sanitization:** Clean the dispenser regularly with a mild detergent and water. Sanitize the dispensing nozzle and other touchpoints to prevent the spread of germs.

*   **Preventive Maintenance:** Schedule regular maintenance checks to identify and address potential issues before they become major problems.

## conclusion: Hydration Solutions for the Modern Workplace

Choosing the best **water bottle dispenser** for your commercial environment is an investment in the health, well-being, and sustainability of your organization. By carefully considering your specific needs,the type of dispenser,key features,and long-term maintenance requirements,you can select a solution that provides clean,accessible water for years to come. From the convenience of a **free standing water dispenser** to the modern appeal of a **hands-free water bottle dispenser**,the options available in 2025 promise to meet the diverse needs of offices,restaurants,schools,gyms,and commercial buildings alike. As you explore the market for a **best water bottle dispenser**, remember that prioritizing hygiene, durability, and cost-effectiveness will ultimately lead to the most prosperous and beneficial choice for your needs.

1k0zkys,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eloping/comments/1k0zkys/an_intimate_scottish_elopement_for_two_at/,An Intimate Scottish Elopement for Two at Woodside Lodge,"If I could use three words to describe what I wanted our wedding to look like it would be calm, intimate, and joyful.

Even before my husband and I got engaged, we both had explored the possibility of exchanging our vows with just the two of us in a magical place overseas that felt so aptly just. like. us. Little did we know that a little-known place located where the mountains meet the sea would be where we would say I do and begin our married life together while creating the most unforgettable memories.

We were engaged January 10^(th) and 48 hours later we were already in \*loch-\*step with Iain Hopkins, owner and elopement aficionado of a beautiful 12-acre estate of Woodside Lodge in Lochgilphead (i.e., Lochgoilhead or Loch Goil) in the Scottish Highlands in Argyll and Bute, Scotland. Just about 45 minutes outside of Glasgow, Woodside Lodge is not only [picturesque](https://davidgrantsimpsonphotography.pic-time.com/-woodsidelodge/gallery), it has a wonderfully [rich history](https://www.thelodge-scotland.com/our-story) and 

Set to marry on March 4^(th), we had less than 40 days to prepare— but oh! this was part of the excitement in getting married. 

# Wedding Planning with Iain

Stress. The six-letter word no one ever wants when planning their wedding. But are you a people pleaser? Do you have family and friends far and wide? Do you find expenses ballooning with each new thing? Given that we would answer yes to all of the above, we realized we truly wanted to celebrate our day without fuss and simply wanted to experience each other’s love. Iain provided us with options that were all inclusive 3-day, 2 night packages. For those of you considering budget, at the time we married, this package was a little under 5,000 pounds, but please know this is an estimate and could change. Iain also offers pickup from the Glasgow airport if needed, but since we were already touring Scotland beforehand, we didn’t need this service. We have exclusive use as the only guests of the grounds and Iain is only a text or phone call away at the main lodge for anything we needed. Since it was just us two, we went with the Seal Cabin which included accommodations for 2 in the coziest cabin on the water for 3 days and 2 nights:

**Day 1**

* Victorian afternoon tea (after you arrive and settle in)
* Dinner with wine

**Day 2 (Wedding Day)**

* Full Highland Breakfast Coffee & Cake
* Bride & Grooms bouquet & buttonhole
* Pre-ceremony fizz (Iain provides tea, coffee, juices, water, wine, beer, and other fizzy drinks in the fridge in the cabin)
* Wedding Ceremony (you get to pick the location!)
* Champagne and canapés after the ceremony 
* Wedding Cake
* Delicious Wedding Feast with Wine
* Tea, Coffee & Cheese Platter

**Day 3 (check out)**

Unless you choose to add 1 more night which we did!—highly recommend so you can get the full experience of Loch Goil)

* Full Highland Breakfast – Departure on day 3 at 11am

If you are looking for a larger elopement package, they also offer the same amenities as the Seal Cabin but for a Red Squirrel Cabin Wedding stay (3 bedrooms) for up to 6 people.

Iain recommended a couple local photographers for us and we ended up hiring [David Simpson Photography](https://davidgrantsimpsonphotography.pic-time.com/-woodsidelodge/gallery)and could not imagine a more wonderful human to capture our day. Since our wedding was part of our bigger trip around Scotland, Iain also provided us with a personalized itinerary with recommendations for food, experiences, and destinations. What was so wonderful about working with Iain and his partner Alice was that we could make our wedding as personal as we wanted to, and he has countless relationships with various vendors and people to fully customize your day in addition to what is already included in your package.

# Getting our Marriage Visa (as US American Citizens)

While a symbolic ceremony would have been an easier route, we decided to marry legally in Scotland. Woodside Lodge includes an [FAQ page](https://www.thelodge-scotland.com/weddings/elopements) on the basics. Iain connected us with Samantha at the Argyll and Bute Council to coordinate and file all the paperwork we needed on the Scottish government side of things to meet the minimum 29-day period.

On the American side of things, was applied for a [Marriage Visitor visa](https://www.gov.uk/marriage-visa/apply) through the UK government website. It took about the full 4 weeks without expediting any part of the process. Keep in mind, you will need to schedule your [biometric screening](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/usa-apply-for-a-uk-visa/apply-for-a-uk-visa-in-the-usa#book-and-attend-your-biometric-appointment) at an [Application Support Center](https://visa.vfsglobal.com/usa/en/gbr/attend-centre/usa-application-support-centre) (ASC) near you (or [VFS Premium Application Centre](https://visa.vfsglobal.com/usa/en/gbr/attend-centre) (PAC). Once you complete your biometric screening, don’t forget to mail in your passport to the [USCIS ASC](https://visa.vfsglobal.com/usa/en/gbr/attend-centre/usa-application-support-centre) in New York, NY. Once they receive your passport, it takes about 2 weeks to hear back and if a return label was not included, they will reach out, so you pay for return shipping of your passport.

# Arriving to Woodside Lodge on Loch Goil

From the moment the road curved into Loch Goil, our breath was taken away. Along the road and past the town, you skirt along the water. Past the café and boat rental place, we arrived at the rod-iron gate and phone Iain who buzzed us in. Preparing the cabin himself to make sure no detail is missed, we were greeted by his wonderful dog, Skye, and himself to help us carry our bags to the cabin. Inside our cozy cabin, Iain had it full stocked with fruit, coffee, tea, various beverages in the fridge, treats, firewood, kindling, and more! It felt as if this place instantly became our home away from home as soon as we walked through that door.

[Welcome note and treats in the Seal Cabin when we arrived](https://preview.redd.it/digh3r9geave1.jpg?width=2516&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c8d31fccee00e47e232417d0e210f73a64d865b5)

After we settled in, Iain set up afternoon tea for us just outside on our balcony overlooking the water.  It was a full spread of hors d'oeuvres, cheese, pastries, and various tasty treats that were all sourced locally or homemade. This foodie experience was just the beginning of the explosive flavors that were about to change our tastebuds forever.

Our evening ended with the most decadent and delectable dinner in the Potting Shed. The candles were lit, the woodburning stove warmed the place, and the mist outside slowly turned to raindrops as we were taken on a journey of food through the eyes of Iain and Alice. We learned that when the famous treehouse came down after a storm, Iain repurposed the wood from the cabin and created what is now called the Potting Shed. How lovely is that?! Each course was thoughtfully prepared and by the end of it we felt we had a meal fit for queens and kings. I can’t even begin to describe the experience other than it felt as if we were transported into our very own Michelin-rated 5-star experience.

# Our Wedding Day

Iain and Alice ensured that our day was as stress free as possible by being the most gracious and thoughtfully professional hosts we could have ever asked for. We were able to wake up and have a full breakfast in the Potting Shed with ease going into our day. All we had to do was confirm how the day would go and we just had to worry about getting ready and meeting with our photographer once he arrived an hour before we were set to wed. Iain and Alice are the behind-the-scenes experts that make you feel like you have no worries and only love and happiness to revel in and enjoy in your partner’s company.

My husband and I married under the wooden pavilion, and enjoyed champagne, canapes, cake shortly after in the greenhouse. We were able to spend time just the two of us reflecting on what just happened before our photographer whisked us away for photos. 

Iain and Alice prepared a multi-course dinner complete with wines paired for the meals and brought over our wedding cake that we didn’t finish to enjoy back at our cabin. All the food was sourced within the Loch or just a Loch over. Iain takes a lot of pride in the food he sources and the relationships he has built to ensure you have the best while making it all feel warm and cozy.

Our day was truly magical and it would not have been what it was without the absolutely wonderful energy that Iain and Alice bring to make our day happen.

# Extra Day + Checking out

We ended up extending our stay an additional day so we could explore Loch Goil a bit more. Iain reserved a table for us for dinner at the local Inn after a full day of exploring the nearby town of Inverary where there was plenty of shopping, whiskey tasting, and moments to get to know some of the locals. Iain provided plenty of options for our extra day. If you have a chance, we highly recommend talking with Iain and Alice and getting to know their passion for creating magical experiences for elopers. You can feel the love they have for the places they live in and for the work they do and the relationships they have built. We cannot wait to return for our anniversaries in the future.  ",2,1744848820.0,Eloping,0,1.0,False

My friend is 25F and a teacher, she works at the other side of the country and I hadn't seen her since Christmas.


She's been with her bf (34M, let's call him Ian) for a little over a year now. I knew they had minor issues (she called them like that, without mentioning any further information) since some time now. Yesterday she was about to go to his house to spend the day together before she returned to her hometown for Easter holidays (it's Orthodox Easter now). He called her a few minutes before she was about to arrive at his house and asked her to get him bottled water from the supermarket (6 x 1,5L) but she accidentally picked up sparkling water without noticing (girl was walking a 45 minute walk to go to his house). When she finally went to his house Ian started yelling at her, poor girl told me her hands and back hurt because of the weight she carried and he wasn't even nice enough to excuse the mistake. He made her return the water after yelling and being mean to her for 10 minutes straight. When she returned to his house she couldn't help it and cry and he didn't even bother apologising for his manners, he only said ""you're a 25 year old woman, stop crying"".


Second part of their afternoon. She told me that after calming down a bit they made love twice and then he dumped her for one and a half hour straight alone in bed while he was trying to fix some settings on his gaming PC (Ian is an avid gamer). She was telling him that he has all of the next days available to do anything he wanted on his PC and the time they had together was valuable and also that she missed him because the past few weeks they weren't seeing eachother much (something for which he was whining and crying to her for days as she told me afterwards). And he responded ""What, you want us to be literally stuck onto eachother ? I want to finish this"". She felt very bad and just layed there in bed til he finally finished with his bs and went to lay next to her, while asking ""did my little baby miss me ?"". After that he started (really randomly) telling her that he wants her to change the style of her eyebrows because ""he didn't like them and they're really thick"". My friend is gorgeous (I ain't exaggerating) and one of the most naturally beautiful people I know. She then told him that she loves her brows the way they are and he said ""But I'm going to like you more if you change them"". Then he attacked her personal dressing style and told her they need to go shopping together because he doesn't like her style ""it's too athletic and I want you more elegant"" and also that he always dresses well and her style doesn't match his and of course that ""he is going to like her more if she dresses the way he likes"".


She cried again after this and told him to take her home. She slept there and returned to her hometown today where we met for a coffee. Am I wrong for wanting to interfere and even talk to a family member of hers about her toxic relationship ? Since I know she won't be telling anyone and I feel like this guy is just poisoning her heart and soul.",5,1744848536.0,amiwrong,5,1.0,False

I remember the first time I introduced the **futuro anteriore** to my students. Their eyes widened as if I'd just told them they could time travel! This tense is like a magic trick, letting you talk about things that will have happened before something else in the future. It's like predicting tomorrow's weather while sipping your morning coffee.

**Why is it special?**

Picture this: You're planning a trip to Italy. You tell your friend, *""Quando **avrai finito** di prepararti, partiremo per Roma!""* (When you have finished getting ready, we will leave for Rome!). Here, finishing getting ready is the action that will be completed before you head out. It's the perfect tense for those who love planning ahead!

**How to form it?**

- Use **essere** or **avere** in the simple future.
- Add the **past participle** of the main verb.

Here's a fun tidbit: If you're using **essere**, the past participle agrees in **gender** and **number**. So, if you're a lady who's leaving, you'd say, *""Io **sarò partita**.""*

**Real-life scenarios**

Imagine your friend hasn't arrived yet. You might say, *""**Si saranno persi**!""* (They must have gotten lost!). It's like Sherlock Holmes in Italian, deducing what might have happened.

**Your turn!**

Dive into the world of the **futuro anteriore**. Share a story or ask a question below. Who knows, maybe you'll inspire someone else's Italian journey!

(Low pop area, no one in line behind me if anyone was concerned) Anyway, turns out we have a few things in common and end up having a very pleasant conversation.

She never did call, but every time I went in, which wasn't often, 3 or 4 times that year, she told me she still has my number and would call if she ever found a loophole that allowed her to.

Every morning, he awoke in a bed swallowed by dust,                                                                                        within a room painted in the colors of forgetting, weak and mundane.                                                             Grey walls, pale light, and the scent of time too long spent still plastered all around.  
Clutter piled like memories no one wanted,                                                                                                    objects with no name, no purpose, no voice.

That morning, like many before,  
his eyes opened with the weight of a cold that burned,  
a gaze as lifeless and petrified as the stone benches in the park nearby.  
To the world, Karl Kassil had a good life  
a son to proud parents, a friend to admiring peers,  
a man of laughter and kindness.  
But Karl had never looked in the mirror  
and seen the man they all spoke of.

He left his plaster-scented tomb for the hallway,  
offering a strained smile to his neighbour, Hector,  
a smile that peeled his lips like the old wallpaper of his office walls.  
Thin, stretched, and cracking.  
Hector responded, in some way.  
Karl could not remember how.  
The face of his neighbour distorted,                                                                                                                       as he never looked at it with care.                                                                                                                     Scared of the people that thought of him as fair.

His job  
a place neither loved nor hated  
received him as it always did:  
with coffee too hot, paper towers,  
and the familiar queue of lights that never flickered.  
Time did not pass there; it circled.  
Shifts ended, yet felt eternal.  
He completed nothing,  
yet he was always being promoted.

Endless stamping.  
Endless forms.  
Endless proof of his presence,  
even when he felt more absent than air in a vacuum.

Hector called, but Karl did not know who he was.                                                                                            Scared of the voice that could ridicule and crumble his routine.

Then, one day  
perhaps a Tuesday, though days had long lost names  
Karl rose to submit yet another unfinished stack  
and noticed the silence.

There was no one.

The office, once humming with footsteps and sighs,  
was now hollow.  
Empty desks. Silent phones.  
The coffee machine blinking with no one to refill it.  
He paused,  
waiting for someone to laugh,  
for it to be a joke,  
for the silence to be broken.

But no sound came.

No hesitation he sat back down.  
The chair creaked, familiar as a sigh.  
He picked up the stamp again,  
his hands moving before his thoughts could protest.  
He knew it was futile.  
But it was something.

Outside the window,  
a city without footsteps stood still.  
No cars passed. No birds sang.  
Even the clouds seemed to forget how to move.

Karl kept working.

He did not know if he had eaten,  
if he had slept,  
if the lights were still on or if he simply imagined them.  
The papers replenished themselves.  
The ink never dried.  
The tasks never ended.

And maybe that was the point.

Perhaps the world had left him behind.  
Or perhaps he had left it long ago.  
He couldn’t remember.  
Only the stamping remained  
a rhythm to hold onto,  
a heartbeat made of paper and ink.

And so, Karl Kassil,  
a fine, established man  
became the last ghost in his own city of silence,  
haunted not by the dead, but his own choices.

He worked.

For some men chase dreams,  
some chase love,  
and some, like Karl  
chase the comfort of doing something,  
even when nothing you waited for remains.

Had he been dreaming,                                                                                                                                       Had he been subjected to a joke,                                                                                                                              he did not know.                                                                                                                                                       He did not break his cycle until the paper turned to snow.

He remembers that snow,                                                                                                                                   when his friends made a puppet freezing cold, unbothered, unchanged,                                                                 Until the end came for the puppet a fate too strong to be controlled.                                                                   Karl looked at the puppet and realized something true.                                                                                         His friends left by mistake and he never made friends anew.                                                                                   His friends created the puppet, it looked happy it smiled,

But the puppet wasn’t a puppet, it was Karl all the while.                                                                                         No new choices,                                                                                                                                          unchanged every day until the deadline called.

The moment everyone disappeared Karl was in thought,                                                                                        but now he realized that his life has stopped. He’s dead, he’s stuck.                                                                          The time was done.                                                                                                                                                  The deadline was met.

As life does not stop for you and for all the time you’ve stalled.                                                                             You weren’t ready, not until the end.                                                                                                                       You made choices, yet made none.

Karl made his peace, by ending the life that he had.                                                                                                        At last he made a choice and one with no regret.",1,1744847876.0,u_Haruto_Barai,0,1.0,False

Thought it went well, but I guess not?","I (M20) met her (F19) through a club in college. The club meets weekly, and we've known each other since the first meeting, but we didn't really talk much. She is definitely my type, but I didn't pursue anything. Recently, however, we ended up chatting it up through a club event, and I felt that our chemistry was good. She asked me for my Instagram, and soon after, I sent her a text asking her out on a date. My intentions were clear, as I started the message off with ""I think you're really pretty and would like to get to know you better"". She said yes.

The date happened, and I thought it went well. We talked about our mutual interests, and she made effort to keep the conversation going. If anything, she talked more than I did. We originally intended on getting coffee, but we got a meal afterwards as well. I floated the idea of meeting again next weekend, but she said she'd be busy. After the date, I sent a text indicating that I'd be happy to meet up again, and she said she would as well and would let me know when she has time.

However, at our next club meeting, it felt like we were barely acquaintances again. To be fair, no one really talks at our club meetings since everyone is doing their own tasks. I was planning on chatting with her after the meeting for a few minutes, but she left very quickly, as if she was avoiding me.

It was awesome seeing some of you one Saturday at the coffee tasting. Hope to see you next time. Some updates:

* we refreshed the website: [experimental.coffee](http://experimental.coffee) — a bit back to the basics and we'll figure out our brand identity as we get cooking this year. I'd love your feedback.
* our next drops are locked in: a *dope* passionfruit washed coffee from Jairo Arcila out of Quindio Colombia that won us over from over two dozen samples we roasted and cupped, followed by a lychee and/or strawberry washed coffee from Jairo as well. We have some more samples coming in throughout the next two weeks that we'll line up for June and July, but May is looking really good for us.

We're shifting our vision a bit from our learnings from the R&D pack. We're coupling Experimental with an education component, because we think that the average coffee drinker doesn't currently know how to prepare and drink the coffees we want to bring to the market. But we know how awesome these coffees can be for consumers and for the producers we support. So, you'll see some events on the website that mark the beginning of this endeavor of pairing experimental coffee with coffee education. 

Let me know what you think!

1k0z82g,https://www.reddit.com/r/daddit/comments/1k0z82g/i_think_my_partner_is_suffering_with_longterm/,I think my partner is suffering with long-term postnatal depression that she won’t admit or talk about and it’s affecting our relationship. I’m exhausted and don’t know where to turn?,"Our first born and only son was born just over two years ago now. He was six weeks premature due to my partner having preeclampsia and was born via c-section and whisked to NICU whilst my partner herself was in ICU and didn’t even get to meet him or hold him until about 14 hours after he was born.

They both recovered well, were discharged from hospital two weeks later, and the transition to home life went smoothly. 

For the first six months, everything was fine. Admittedly as a new dad, my head was all over the place, I made silly mistakes that frustrated my partner but she’d openly teach me where I’d gone wrong and I worked on fixing whatever the problem was. 

It was about 6-8 months later, it was like this switch was flicked and there was a massive change in her. She suddenly became quite snappy and angry over the smallest of things and we’d argue a lot. Our son was going through sleep regression at the time though so I just put it down to exhaustion.

Once he snapped out of the sleep regression though, her moods still majorly fluctuated and still now constantly feel like I’m walking on eggshells with her. Some days she can just get really snappy with me over something really small and petty, then the following day if I’m working in the local area, she’s met me with a coffee and some lunch in hand. 

In general she just seems to be pushing me away. But then at the flick of a switch, she’s fine. I’ve become so down and depressed myself. We’re rarely intimate anymore, there’s days she refuses to eat even if I’ve made her something with the excuse she’s too busy. There’s days she won’t wash or shower either. I own a business that she’s been helping out with a lot over the last six months. Sometimes she helps out a lot and sometimes she just doesn’t care for it at all.

There’s more to it than this but it’s become exhausting not knowing where I stand with her. I don’t know what I’m coming home from work to. I don’t know what I’m waking up on a morning to. Days she struggles with our son I’m either doing too much, or I don’t do anything to help her at all in her eyes. 

I’ve tried to gently talk about potential postnatal depression but she’s either laughed at me and/or denied it completely.

But especially over the last few months, I’m starting to see her struggling with our son if he’s acting up, crying, screaming etc. She’s becoming so stressed, snappy and agitated with him. Snaps at him to stop because her heads pounding because of the crying. And she’s then questioning why he’s started settling a lot easier for me when I go to help. But not only him, it’s her aggression towards me. He’s currently suffering with an ear infection and keeps waking in the night. I’ve just gone to help and saw her in his room with her head in her hands, in a world of her own ignoring anything I had to say. I snuggled up to him and he soon settled. 

She is a fantastic mum. She does everything with him, she has a good social life with good friends who also have kids and meet up often. I work Monday - Friday but help as much as I can around the house when I can whether cooking, cleaning, bedtime for our son, giving her a breather from being with him all day. As much as I can. 

But theres just something going on in her head and it’s starting to really affect our relationship. I’m exhausted with it all and she just doesn’t seem to care if I ever mention it.

1k0z6qv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k0z6qv,"I created the Intel Pentium 5 UltraThread 9G – the processor no one asked for, but everyone secretly wanted","Alright, so here’s the deal: I got bored. Like really bored. While the world’s out there debating Ryzen 9000 vs. Intel Core Ultra Super Duper Max or whatever, I decided to resurrect a legend. But not just resurrect it—rebuild it into something so unhinged, so unnecessarily powerful, and so gloriously nostalgic, that it makes grown nerds weep. Introducing the Pentium 5 UltraThread 9G. Yes. Pentium is back, baby—and this time, it’s packing enough firepower to run a quantum simulation of Clippy’s emotions in real time.

You see, I didn’t want another soulless chunk of silicon. I wanted something with legacy. Something with the spirit of a beige tower PC under your desk in 2001, but with the raw, unfiltered rage of 2025 engineering. A CPU that could both run RollerCoaster Tycoon and simulate planetary weather systems—simultaneously. And so, after weeks of sleepless nights, gallons of coffee, and way too much exposure to vintage Intel commercials, I did it. I built the ultimate retro-futuristic chip. It’s got the Pentium name, but don’t be fooled—this thing could probably boot into Windows 95 and tear a hole in spacetime doing it.

I slapped it into a custom motherboard I cobbled together from a thrifted server rack and a cursed MSI BIOS mod I found on an old forum. It POSTed on the first try and emitted a low, mechanical hum that I can only describe as “deeply judgmental.” Booted up? Ran like a dream. Temps? Ice cold. Power draw? Less than a gaming laptop, but performance? Let’s just say I launched 37 instances of Age of Empires II, trained 20,000 villagers, and the system just laughed. I even rendered a 4K animation of the dancing baby while transcoding an entire DVD collection and playing DOOM inside Excel.

This isn’t a CPU. It’s a tribute. A battle cry. A love letter to everyone who ever defragged their hard drive while listening to Winamp skins. And now, for those who care about numbers (and I know you do): This chip runs with 24 cores, 74 threads, 50 megabytes of L4 cache, and sips a mere 60 watts of power, making it the most ridiculously overengineered and energy-efficient nostalgia bomb ever built. (Disclaimer: Sadly, no, I didn’t actually build this in real life—this is all for fun and entertainment. But wouldn’t it be awesome if it were real?)

Bonus: Want your own Pentium 5 badge? The Images at the top of this post are your very own Intel Pentium 5 UltraThread 9G stickers. One Variant is modern, the other one is in the Intel mid 2000s Style. Download it, print it (go full 2000s and use glossy label paper if you’ve got it), cut it out, stick it on your case, laptop, toaster, fridge, or your friend’s RTX 5090 rig. No one will know what’s real anymore—and that’s the point.

It’s not just a sticker. It’s a statement. It says: “Yes, I remember dial-up. And yes, I also have 74 threads.” Want to go further? Laminate it. Mount it in a retro blister pack. Tell people it unlocks “legacy turbo mode” and watch them nod in confused respect.

1k0z60h,https://www.reddit.com/r/JamesBond/comments/1k0z60h/fleming_novel_rankings_and_my_random_thoughts/,Fleming novel rankings and my random thoughts about each,"Hey all, 

I set out to do a re-read of the Fleming books and thought I’d share not only my rankings but my random thoughts about each. This was in fact my third time reading them. I first read them in college after having grown up with the films. I did a speed read of them a number of years later and found that I still loved them. This time around, I was reading them for research purposes, as I’m writing a Cold War espionage type of book of my own that will in many respects be a nod to Fleming, sort of a palate cleanser between some other (unrelated) novels I’m working on. Something mainly just for fun.

*\*\*Quick plug if interested: for a preview of my character, check out the stories in episodes three (Super Red), forty-one (Well and Truly Stunned), and fifty-four (A Measure of Luck) of the Promptly Written Podcast.*  

So, that meant I was going to approach the books as a writer rather than strictly as a reader. This resulted in some surprises; there were a few changes to what I thought my ranking had been all along. And while the bottom half of my list is pretty solid, I really struggled with my top 5—not only which to include, but in which order to put them. I'm still not certain I have them right.

I wish I had time to do an in-depth analysis of each, but this will have to suffice. So, here it goes:

**From Russia with Love** 

* This stands as some of Fleming’s best writing. He writes with authority and includes lots of great detail that really grounds you in the world.
* Shows a true mastery of the genre, had Fleming actually wanted to write something on the LeCarre end of the spectrum.
* This is the first one I ever read, and so I’m somewhat biased.
* Might be first instance of “Bond, James Bond,"" or at least the first instance I noticed.
* The nuanced honeypot trap makes for a good Cold War tale. 
* I have two critiques that really only exist in comparison with the film: 
   * Darko Kerim is not as likable as my boy Kerim Bey in the film.
   * The train sequence isn’t quite as engaging as the film.
* I don't know that I love the cliffhanger ending. In context of the larger series, I’m OK with it. But as a standalone, it’s a hangnail. Though I suppose it fits in better with a straight-faced take on the spy genre.

**Thunderball** 

* The plot is meticulously drawn out, and for the most part it all feels entirely feasible, though there is a good deal of happenstance on Bond’s part. 
* I really enjoyed seeing Blofeld’s background as well as getting such a thorough look at the opposition like you do in FRWL.
* I forgot how good of an adaptation the film is with regard to the book: trolling Largo in the casino, underwater battle, the Shrublands sequence, etc.
* Even though we know the score early on, there’s still a lot of tension via Bond and Leiter's interactions.
* On that note, Leiter really cracks me up. He’s such a fun character who’s never truly been done right in films. Jack Lord might’ve been able to do it, but he was a bit too cool for school.
* Leiter is also a pretty tough fellow, heading out with the Navy commandos despite his lack of hand and foot. 
* The other thing I find humorous is how much better Bond feels after his health has improved; his new outlook on life even seems to irk M. But then when faced with his first tough assignment, he’s back to his old ways.
* The ending is really kind of sweet and wholesome with Bond falling asleep at Domino’s bedside.
* All in all, I don’t really have any major critiques with this one. Thunderball is overall excellent.

**For Your Eyes Only** 

* Truly some of Fleming’s best writing. He really seems relaxed here; he’s not out trying to write a best-selling thriller. 
* Not a bad story in the batch. 
* I think perhaps Bond would have been better off settling down with Mary Ann Russell (from the story From a View to a Kill). 
* Lots of movie material here: 
   * FYEO: Havelock revenge story with Judy filling in for Melina 
   * Risico: Colombo, Kristatos, and the dock attack from the film version of FYEO.
   * The Hildebrand Rarity: Milton Krest from LTK fame.
* I'm hard-pressed to pick a favorite, so here are the highlights: 
   * From a View to a Kill: Underappreciated Bond girl in Mary Ann—she's tough, capable, courageous, and pragmatic; also the motorcycle angle with Bond doing a stakeout and then riding as a decoy is really great stuff. 
   * FYEO: Bond making some sandwiches, filling a thermos with coffee and whisky, and then setting out on foot through the Vermont wilderness.
   * QoS: Some of Bond’s best moments are when he’s observing/listening to others in more of a cerebral manner than you get in some of Fleming’s early stories. 
   * Risico: the parity with the film version of FYEO, especially the scene on Colombo’s ship where he earns Bond’s trust. 
   * The Hildebrand Rarity: The unsettledness at the end where Bond is facing the prospects of spending four days with Liz who may or may not be a black widow of sorts.

**Moonraker** 

* This one moved up a bit in my rankings.
* Marked improvement in writing and pacing over the first two books. 
* The gambling scenes are genuinely tense.
* Characterizations of Drax are great.
* The time spent with M is fun, and an insight into the MI6 day to day is interesting. 
* Gala Brand might be the most likable Bond girl along with Mary Ann Russell. Some might say she’s a bit one-note, but I view her as stable and competent and without any of the personality whiplash that some of the others have. 
* Might be the first time we see Bond troll the villain a bit.
* I enjoy seeing Bond and his Bentley. 
* The plot is suitably complex and doesn’t suffer from any pacing issues. 
* I think what I like about MR is that Bond is pretty much even-keel here. He’s not facing a crisis of conscience or dealing with loss, not soul-sick like he is in the beginning of Goldfinger. This is a good view of Bond more or less in his prime.

**On Her Majesty’s Secret Service** 

* The first time I read it, this book made me truly appreciate the film, and now after having watched (and enjoyed) the film so many times, I wonder if my enjoyment of the film colors my enjoyment of the book. It’s kind of weird how that reversed. 
* I read all of Fraulein Bunt’s dialogue in Ilse Steppat’s voice. 
* On this read through, I found Bond understandably apprehensive about his venturing up the mountain to the dragon’s lair, though a bit more cavalier than I remember once he’s actually there. Maybe it’s because things seemed so much more tense in Thunderball. That said, there are tense moments even if Bond is still distracted by the girls, and he does find himself sweating at least once. 
* I think the film’s romance montage between Bond and Tracy serves the story much better than the book’s treatment. That is, I tend to forget about Tracy more in the book than the film during the time that Bond is at Piz Gloria. Though “forgetting” about her does make the rescue scene more impactful when she shows up out of the blue, just at the right time. 
* I love the physical transformation of Blofeld. 
* Fleming makes Draco a warm character even though he’s a criminal involved in many unsavory activities. Bond takes to him despite this, and it’s not the first instance of this type of trope where Bond forms an affinity for sketchy characters (Darko Kerim and Columbo come to mind). They seem to have their own private morality as does Bond at times, and I wonder if that’s got something to do with it. Fleming certainly nailed down the romantic scoundrel sort of idea, and I know some or all of these types were based on real people he’d met.  
* There is a proliferation of exclamation points in this book. This is a good example of little things I’ve noticed throughout that I wish Fleming’s editor would’ve caught, similar to his overuse of the word “directly” in Casino Royale (I read the original British version). 
* The Christmas Day scene at M’s home drags a bit and hurts the pacing at a critical point in the story. 
* All of Blofeld’s motivations for his schemes aren’t ever really spelled out; even his scheme itself is deduced rather than learned. I think the film improves on this aspect of the story. 
* I enjoyed how resourceful Bond is in his escape from Piz Gloria using his wits and makeshift weapons. 
* The bobsled run is a great sequence. 
* The final moment in the film with Bond holding Tracy mirrors the book pretty much to a T. I think Lazenby haters ought to read the book, and they might grow some appreciation for his performance here. 
* It hurts a bit to bump this down to #5 after having been my favorite the first two read-throughs. It just didn’t hit the same this time.

**The Spy Who Loved Me** 

* Despite the flak this one gets, I really enjoy it. Viv’s backstory is laid out, we see her seemingly cozy and safe, and then we find out she’s not alone nor safe for that matter. It’s a simple plot device, but it works for me. 
* Yes, Bond doesn’t show up for over half the book, but you know he’s coming, and when he shows up, you are absolutely ready for him—not because you’re sick of Viv’s tale, but because you know what’s in store for Horror and Sluggsy. 
* Regarding Horror and Sluggsy, they are IMO Fleming’s best sketch of American gangsters. I can’t say whether it’s an *accurate* sketch, but prior attempts feel a bit lackluster. These guys are truly scary. That said, it may have been Fleming poking fun at these types of guys in the other books, intentionally making them look a bit silly. 
* I like Viv’s “voice” as she tells her story. 
* I’m not going to lie; I really want this one in my top 5, but I wasn’t sure how I’d manage to explain that! I’m sure #6 is outrageous enough.

**Dr. No** 

* Another instance where the book material is adapted well—some of the dialogue is used like in FRWL. 
* Fleming continues to write with authority, likely because he knew Jamaica really well.
* The story veers close to Sci-Fi but never really gets there.
* I feel as though the big reveal of Dr. No’s real plot (missile toppling) is revealed too late. However, the reveal of Dr. No himself is done really well; the reader is kept in suspense. 
* Bummer that Quarrel dies. 
* The classic Bond film trope of being wined and dined by the enemy really comes into focus here. 
* Bond uses his ingenuity to survive, which is some of the most fun stuff Fleming does with the character.

**Live and Let Die** 

* Mr. Big is presented as ominous and extremely capable with resources everywhere; he looms over Bond’s every step, it seems, and it’s an effective device.
* Leiter proves to be a likable ally.
* Training with Quarrel sequence was great, even though such a short regimen would be next to useless in real life for such a heavy smoker/drinker. 
* The final showdown, swimming with the sharks/barracuda, the sinking of Mr. Big’s yacht, etc. is all good stuff. 
* The warehouse sequence with the Robber was fun (LTK adapted this scene). 
* Bond reads a research book to brush up on voodoo. This makes sense since he'd want to be informed about it, though he seems to accept that it's real, which struck me as out of character for him. I would think he'd be more likely to brush it aside as superstitious.

**Octopussy** 

* Octopussy: 
   * Major Smythe seems to be a self-portrait of Fleming, both health and vice wise. 
   * It’s interesting to me that Bond appears as a dark shadow in Smythe’s life to which he’s barely hanging on, and I wonder if any of that is symbolic. 
   * This seems to be a morality tale of sorts, hearkening back to some of the stories in FYEO. 
   * I really enjoy the observer’s view of Bond rather than being in Bond’s head all the time. 
* The Living Daylights:
   * This is a taut little story that sees a morose Bond viewing his mission with reluctance—he's assigned to kill in cold blood more or less, something he doesn’t like doing. 
   * Fans of film version of The Living Daylights will love this one (sniper scene overseen by a stuffy administrative type). 
   * It’s classic Bond here, falling for a woman solely on the romanticism in the way she walks/moves. 
   * It’s interesting to see Bond’s boredom mixed with the tension of his pending task; he moves around Berlin a bit and tries to occupy his time. 
   * As an aside, I re-read Fleming’s Thrilling Cities for research purposes, and as I’d decided to place a good chunk of my current book in Berlin, I relied on some of his reporting to fill in some period-specific details. This included Fleming drinking boilermakers at the Cafe Marquardt. I “borrowed” this anecdote for my character only to find Fleming already did so with Bond! And here I thought I was being clever... 

* The Property of a Lady:
   * This is a nice little tale with some good ol’ Cold War espionage.
   * Bond finds himself under the tutelage of an expert much like in DAF and GF (diamonds and gold, respectively). 
   * I always enjoy the collegial cooperation the secret service enjoys with other domestic institutions when needed. 
   * The auction scene was adapted in the film Octopussy.

**You Only Live Twice** 

* I was struck by the fact that Bond doesn’t have any inner monologue or thoughts about Tracy after only nine months. He does admit not ever believing he’d feel anything for anyone again after meeting Kissy, but that’s really the only acknowledgment of his personal tragedy short of his job performance in the beginning of the novel. I get that he’s not a super cerebral person, but he does have an inner life that’s highlighted in other books. I would’ve liked to have seen it more here. 
* Bond is quite cantankerous in this one, similar to Goldfinger. 
* The amount of sake he consumes seems insane, though I’m not familiar with sake nor have I ever had it. 
* I felt like Fleming was speaking through both Bond and Tanaka in certain passages where they are talking about their countries, especially England. 
* There is a certain theme of rebirth here in two senses: 1. Bond is sent by M to prove himself after Tracy’s death, and 2. Bond’s immersion into Ama culture and subsequent amnesia at the end. 
* The book meanders a bit in the first half, and it provides an interesting look at Japan, a country and culture I find really interesting. Though it wastes an opportunity to really analyze Bond’s loss. It seems he’s really buried it deep down and doesn’t really consider it. 
* Overall, this is a fitting entry in the Blofeld trilogy, where Bond’s story (especially since OHMSS) starts to take on a larger, more mythic feel that ventures outside the earlier, more hard-boiled Cold War stuff, though I wish it were a stronger entry overall. To put it another way, I really like the idea of the book, but in execution, it leaves me wanting.

**Casino Royale** 

* There's a really good story here, but just not executed as well as it could be:
   * Pacing issues.
   * Bond as a character is really blunt and brusque and isn’t articulated well.
* Explanation of how Chemin de Fer is done well.
* Bond’s waxing philosophical with Mathis in the hospital seems out of place; it really feels like Fleming speaking through his character or perhaps an issue of telling rather than showing.
* I totally forgot Leiter was in this; I almost would’ve liked it better if Mathis were the only ally, as much as I like Leiter. 
* Bond’s decision to propose to Vesper comes way out of left field; it’s completely inexplicable to me. 
* Fleming should’ve built their relationship more prior to the beating.
* I am actually so shocked by how much less (relatively speaking) I enjoyed CR this time around that I almost want to read it again to see what I missed. Previously I had it somewhere in the middle...

**Diamonds are Forever** 

* I enjoyed the plot more this time around.
* I know that part of Fleming's schtick is absurdity, but Spang’s wild west town is still a bit of an oddity to me.
* The final scene shooting down the helicopter was cool--I'd totally forgotten about it.
* Some segments of the story are more interesting than others. The time spent in NY around the horse race goes a bit long as does some of the time on the cruise ship. 
* I liked the framing of things with the opening and closing of the pipeline from a story structure point of view.
* Tiffany strikes me as bit of a split personality, and I don’t understand why she’s so well regarded as a character.

**The Man with the Golden Gun** 

* After the “rebirth” theme of YOLT, it’s interesting that Fleming sort of comes full circle and writes something in the vein of his earlier stories. 
* Scaramanga, like most Fleming villains, is well drawn. He’s rough around the edges but intelligent. 
* I think the weakness of the story is not that it was apparently only in an unfinished draft status when Fleming died, but that it relies on the whole “Bond gets himself inexplicably employed by the villain” trope. This worked well in something like Moonraker but doesn’t work as well here or in Goldfinger. The whole plot relies on Bond filling an almost useless role for far too long.
* I like that Bond is finally offered knighthood, though you’d think it would ‘ve happened by now. I also like that he turns it down. 
* You do wonder how Bond will take down Scaramanga, and how it all plays out gets him off the hook to a certain extent, but certainly not without damage to his well being. 
* Overall, the story feels really low stakes. 
* I love that Leiter pops up again, essentially bookending the series (though I still feel CR would be better with just Mathis). 
* The final paragraph really seals the deal with the whole idea of Bond: the sense of never settling, of always looking to the horizon for what’s next (and presumably adventure). This framing of the character is captured so well in John Pearson’s unofficial Bond biography, leaving off with an aging Bond heading out on another mission, and is a big reason why the ending of NTTD sits so sour with me. It’s just not as simple as “Bond never gives up” (though that is true). It’s that his whole character, his whole raison d’etre, is to stand in as that adventurous impulse, heading into the unknown, facing down the dragon. That's not an impetus that can be killed.

**Goldfinger** 

* The food scene with Du Pont was great. 
* This is the first  glimpse of Bond’s “soul sickness.” He's overindulged and gotten sick of the grisly aspects of his job. I think it's such a great set up, but Fleming never really does anything with it. 
* The characterization of Goldfinger and how much Bond dislikes him is amusing. 
* The gold conversation with Smithers reminded me a bit of the convo in Diamonds regarding the diamond industry.
* There are lots of pacing issues here: the golf game goes long as does the “hoods' convention.” Even Bond’s trailing of Goldfinger goes on for a bit. 
* The thing that really stuck out for me this time was Bond’s dinner at Goldfinger’s home. It just really seemed strange, just the two of them feeling each other out, so to speak. Kind of awkward. There’s a lot between Bond and Goldfinger’s relationship that strains believability; I think Goldfinger would have otherwise killed Bond early on. The movie handles this a bit better. 
* Bond is really antagonistic toward Oddjob and holds Koreans in very low esteem for reasons not given; it’s kind of jarring and doesn’t seem to serve the story in any way. 
* I did enjoy how it all wraps up on the plane; it’s a good bit of tension that was sorely missing throughout the book.

Now that I'm done, I'm kind of bummed that it's over and want to read them all again. That said, I do feel I need a break and am moving on to another LeCarre novel instead. At some point I may revisit my top 5 to see if I can't pin them down a bit better. Let me know your thoughts...",1,1744847599.0,JamesBond,0,0.67,False
1k0z3gw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1k0z3gw/aita_for_feeling_some_type_of_way_about_my_best/,AITA for feeling some type of way about my best friend,"I (28F) have known my best friend (27F) for almost 8 years. We’re complete opposites. I’m bubbly, loud, and easily make friends. She’s more reserved and has a harder time connecting with people. I guess opposites attract, because somehow, we just work.

We met at university. At first, we didn’t really connect, but over time we went from classmates to close friends. I didn’t initially consider her a best friend because it didn’t really feel like that at first. But eventually I got used to having her around and settled into it.

She’s always mainly confided in me, since she doesn’t really have other friends. I have a few close ones, so I didn’t always lean on her emotionally, not because I didn’t care, but because she doesn’t always “get” me. I come from a big, poor family. She’s an only child from a well-off, sheltered background. Still, she’s a great listener and we’ve had lots of fun together.

Once we graduated and got into the workforce, our contact faded a bit. We’d meet up for coffee or lunch now and then, and mostly kept in touch by phone. Nothing too regular, but I didn’t mind…life gets busy. Working 40 hours a week is no joke.

Three years ago, I moved to another country (still in Europe), about 2.5 hours by train or 1.5 by car from where I used to live. All of my other friends have visited me at least once. She never has. But whenever I visit my hometown and don’t make time to see her specifically, she gets upset. And she always expects me to travel all the way to her side, which adds about an hour to my trip. After the fourth time of doing that, I decided I was done going the extra mile… literally… unless she’d meet me halfway. She never has. I’ve accepted that that’s just the level of effort she’s willing to give.

Fast forward: last year she got engaged. I was so excited for her. She had a small city hall wedding, since her traditional wedding would take place overseas. I wasn’t invited to the city hall part because she only invited a handful of people and didn’t want to pay extra. I get it. Still, I wanted her to feel special, so I threw her a mini surprise bachelorette party.

Now, I’m not rich. I live paycheck to paycheck and sometimes don’t know how I’ll make ends meet. But I told myself: she’s only getting married once. She deserves the world.

I planned a private spa day for just the two of us, complete with pool, jacuzzi, lunch with fruit, snacks, bread, hummus, tapenade, cocktails — the works. She loves luxury (some might say materialistic, but I see it as high standards). I asked her if there were any other friends she’d like to include. She gave me numbers of two coworkers she talks to daily. I also invited them, to the spa but they declined due to the cost…fair enough. They decided to join us after the spa. 

I also bought her a gift: a gold charm bracelet from a specific (for
me expensive) brand that allows you to add charms over time. I even got her two charms to start with, both with personal meaning. When I gave it to her, she seemed happy and thanked me, saying her husband would get tired of her buying charms everywhere. But she didn’t try it on or check if it fit. I offered to help her figure out how to open it, and she just said she’d do it at home. I didn’t think much of it in the moment.

After the spa, I surprised her with a high cocktail at a cocktail bar, where we were joined by the two coworkers. On the way there, she told me how much she dislikes one of them (let’s call her Melissa). She said Melissa was annoying, attention-seeking, “She has a higher degree than her but is still so stupid at work,” etc. I was shocked; why give me her number then? She also said she couldn’t be herself around them and that I’d see a “different side” of her. That made me feel bad. I just wanted her to feel special. I just wanted it to be a day she would cherish forever. 

But once we got to the bar… yikes. She wasn’t kidding. She became someone I didn’t recognize. The three of them sat there gossiping the entire time, saying nasty things about coworkers; calling people ugly, sl*ts, you name it. I tried changing the subject a few times, but eventually I just gave up and sipped my drink.

Later that night, her husband picked us up. He dropped the girls off at the station and offered to drive me home to thank me for planning everything (which I deeply appreciated). As soon as the girls left, my best friend said, “Can you believe they didn’t bring a gift? How dare they show up empty-handed.” Even her husband chimed in like it was some kind of crime.

A few days later, I asked if she had tried on the bracelet — I needed to know if it fit in case I had to return it and get a different size. She said she hadn’t tried it yet, but would do so when she traveled and could exchange it if needed. That was 6 months ago. She’s never mentioned the bracelet again. Never worn it (as far as I know). Just… nothing.

So, Reddit… AITA for feeling some type of way about this all.

1k0z1ws,https://www.reddit.com/r/kindness/comments/1k0z1ws/a_character_i_made_up_to_look_up_to/,A character I made up to look up to,"Helper Man is just a guy. You’ve probably seen someone like him before — maybe in a small town, maybe on your street. He wears a wide-brimmed sun hat that’s a little faded at the top, gardening gloves that are more patch than glove by now, heavy old boots caked with stories, and a button-up shirt so full of pockets it’s like a toolkit you can wear.

Every pocket has a purpose. One’s for Band-Aids. Another for dog treats. One carries screws, nails, and a little bit of duct tape. There’s always a pocket with a granola bar. Always one with a pen and a tiny notepad. People in the neighborhood joke he’s got a black hole in there somewhere — that he once pulled out a wrench, a flashlight, and a cup of coffee in one go.

He’s not loud. Not flashy. He just… shows up.

If your tire’s flat, he’s there with a pump before you even realize. If your groceries are too heavy, he’ll carry them without a word. He doesn’t ring doorbells for thanks. He doesn’t take pictures for social media. He just waves with that easy smile and gets back to whatever quiet thing he was doing before.

The kids love him. He fixes their bike chains and ties their shoelaces when their parents are in a rush. He always has stickers in one of his pockets — the good kind, shiny with stars and dinosaurs and smiling suns.

Nobody knows where he came from. He just started showing up a few years ago, and now it’s like he’s part of the neighborhood’s bones. People say he used to be something big — an engineer, a soldier, maybe even a doctor — but he never talks about the past. He just says, “I like it better helping folks one thing at a time.”

He doesn’t want money. He doesn’t want recognition. He just wants to make the world around him a little bit lighter, one tiny kindness at a time.

And somehow, he does.

But lately over the last few days I have been smelling really strong smells specifically from my Hades altar. 

Now one of them is the scented candle I haven't lit it in a while but randomly the scent will get really strong. It's a scented candle, I know this subreddit is already very against candles for divination and communication. So I could maybe just throw that out as a flaw or something or just a candle being a candle, I don't know. 

But the other thing is the coffee I put on his altar. 

Now normally I put the coffee on the altar it's usually warm and then I leave it there for a few weeks and then I switch it out. 

And when I put it on the altar when I'm close and nearby whether it's for praying cleaning things up whatever I can smell it. 

But lately I've been able to smell it from my bed and the weird thing is when I smell it, It smells like it's freshly made like it's warm even though it's been sitting on the altar for a few days. 

Again I don't know if this is an actual thing! Maybe it's all in my head I don't know! I just felt like I should talk about this because it's just so odd and it's been happening for a few weeks now, so it's definitely not just a one-time thing or a coincidence. 🥲

Now before I go any further, let me first say I was in retail for 20 years.  The last 10 of that I was a manager so I have seen it all.  From the worst of the worst customers to the pandemic.  I switched industries due to it being such a soul sucking career.


Anywhere I go nowadays the customer service is horrendous.  From getting coffee to the supermarket.  Employees are rude and just don’t give a shit to give any kind of good customer service.


Today? Went to get cofee- dudes on his phone standing literally at the register.  Didn’t even acknowledge that I was there, but finally looked up and said “what do you need?”

Later that day I went to one of the big box stores.  Usually I don’t ask for help but was looking for something specific for my wife.  Lady I asked was on her phone as well but FaceTiming with someone.  When I politely went up to her and asked for assistance, she acted like I was interfering with her FaceTime and rolled her eyes and said “what can I do for you?”

Went to the supermarket to get things for dinner.  Cashier didn’t even acknowledge me or say at least a hi.  Completely mute from start to end.  Didn’t even make eye contact lol

Seems like ever since Covid these places have really gone down hill.  Even when I hated dealing with the general public when I was in retail, I’d at least try my best to fake it kind of thing.  I couldn’t imagine rolling my eyes at a customer for interrupting my face time call.  In fact if I even had my phone out like that, I’d the very least be written up.

1k0ypi7,https://www.reddit.com/r/RepladiesDesigner/comments/1k0ypi7/a_little_of_something_about_authentic_bags_made/,A little of something about Authentic bags made in China,"so, I ran into this post on FB and while reading it through, there were so many interesting 'theories' so I thought it might be interesting for you guys too!

  
a little bit of something to distract you guys from all the *kimberly drama.*

  
THIS POST IS NOT MINE.

  
\---------------------------

  
Hi Everyone, With everyone learning for the first time about the authentic bags made in China then shipped to respective countries to just add a ""Made in Italy, Spain etc"" tag I thought I would give you my insight and experience. For the last 8 years, I've been a leather artisan specializing in fixing luxury bags (no more than 20% of my business since that's not art - it's work), painting on luxury bags, and repurposing luxury bags with my portfolio being my IG for reference: MarianAmore13. So now that we have my credentials out of the way...



The creation of a handbag consists of 3 things: the leather (or canvas), the hardware, and the artisan who is constructing it.

 1. The Artisan: There are many skilled leather artisans in the world so finding someone to make a bag is easy in the right circles. I'm not ""talented"" because I can sew. I learned it and have had years of practice. This is a skill anyone can learn if they wanted to. 

2. Leather: Leather is sourced from the best tanneries in the world- Italy and France have very prestigious ones and there are also others in Turkey, Spain and the U.S. There are many distrubuters who buy from these tanneries all over the world. There is also an annual leather expo where all the buyers from all over the world attend to see the current and newly released products - that is called Lineapelle which is in Milan, Italy around fall every year. New York also does this but it isn't as big as the Italy one. Anyone can source these leathers. Hermes doesn't have exclusivity on skins like they want to make you the consumer to believe. For example, I can get every kind of leather that both Chanel and Hermes uses. Vachetta literally means ""young cow"" in Italian. A young cow has better skin than an old cow. And that's what ""vachetta"" on your LV bag is. In a leather artisan world that kind of leather is called ""vegetable tanned leather"". So if you go to a local cobbler who doesn't know LV and asked for the vacchetta to be replaced, they likely won't know what you're talking about. But if you said the veg tanned leather needs to be replaced, they will understand you. 

Thus far, if you know a skilled leather sewer and buy the appropriate leather you are 2/3 of the way in replicating this 10k bag you think you can only dream of. But the remaining 1/3 is the hard part...the HARDWARE. How are some of these replicas hardware IDENTICAL to the authentic? I didn't get it until I was a guest on Tanner Leatherstein's podcast a couple years ago. If you don't know Tanner, he's the guy that tears apart expensive bags and tells you their real worth. He is definitely the real deal if you like to learn about the leather industry. So....

3. The Hardware: After we got done recording my guest appearance on his podcast, I asked him if he knew any good hardware suppliers - NOT to make replica bags but to just buy cool and unique hardware since I'm always designing my own belts, straps, etc and I can never find cool buttons and have no experience in metalology nor plan on starting since I do enough and that is a whole trade in itself. He said, they're ALL IN CHINA. None in Europe even. And that even the big houses OEM (subcontract) Chinese factories to make their hardware. He also has toured some of them and basically had to sign over his life to walk into one while being accompanied by security. So my coffee fueled energetic mind immediately jumped to....so that's how they do it. The owners of the factories are subcontracted to make the hardware for these luxury houses.

Therefore either: 

A. Whoever owns these factories is making sure the hardware that's used at the authentic factories falls off the truck and ends up in the hands of others or...

B. Someone inside is taking those blueprints/templates to neighbor hardware making factories and reproducing them there. 

And that is my theory of why these replicas are so insanely identical to the real thing. 

That doesn't fully answer the other question of ""made in Italy"" when 90% of the bag is made in China and that's an easy one. Quite frankly labor and efficiency is just cheaper. Just because X luxury bag costs $$$$$$ this sadly is one business where price doesn't dictate quality. The executives at these companies are driven to do 1 thing- create a profit. And if they're demonstrating they can achieve that by outsourcing they will - pretty simple economics. Is it ethical - not in my book but I'm not the one making these decisions. I'm just the one fixing these overpriced bags for less than you'd pay them to fix them for you. 

And listen, I have my entire collection of AUTHENTIC LV, Chanel, Dior (my favorite from an artisan perspective), Louboutin, Bottega Veneta and even Coach. And I don't feel like my money has been wasted because they are all my unique and beautiful trophies I have earned from hard work. I have also bought my share of replicas because I wanted to learn and compare and understand how to tell the difference (although I am NOT an authenticator and will not do this in the future). My point is don't make these stupid videos make you feel bad. Your bags are yours. Wear them, enjoy them and spend less time on TikTok because at the end of the day if it makes you happy and you can afford it, just buy the damn bag!

This is my experience. I've been a smoker for the last 16 years of my life. I started at 15. Been on the patch for three months. 21mg but even on the patch I smoke 5 a day. 

Even on the patch I still haven't been able to go one day without smoking. It's usually always half an hour after my first meal of the day. Id tell myself I wouldn't smoke after this meal. I have a cold coffee to substitute the smoke. I sit. And then, the craving would hit. And despite half an hour prepping not to smoke. Id find that, Im in autopilot. Every thing else, like my health, ceases to matter. I just need to feel the throat hit of a cigarette. I find myself rushing down before I even know what I'm doing. Everyday. 

And one cigarette would lead to two. And so on. And before I know it, during the day, I would have smoked 5-6 cigarettes while on the patch. 

It got to a point, where I stopped using the patch and went back to smoking. And I started smoking like 15 a day. 

Anyways, I can't afford to buy patches so I'm going to a government hospital where they give it for free as soon as it's 8 am. It's 4 am right now. And I'm going to start the process again but this time, hopefully it'll stick. 

So guys, there's like two contradictory parts of me. One part knows that this is bad for me, but the other part really, really wants to smoke. 

So how do I finally build up the courage, tenacity determination and desire to quit? How do I stay true to that path? I guess I'm scared of cravings. Never have I been able to ignor one.Because when a craving hits, the only way for me to mentally feel okay again is to smoke..that's what I'm scared of. The mental anguish. I always choose killing myself over the mental anguish of a craving.

And also what can I do to not want one, after eating? 

My biggest triggers are being on the vicinity of someone smoking whom I can bum a cigarette off from. 

And after eating..

And then also emotional distress. 

Idk man, been trying everyday for 3 months straight on the patch with gums also. But I still haven't been able to quit. 

Id really appreciate some advice from people whov managed to finally quit..Howe you do it? ",2,1744846145.0,quittingsmoking,2,1.0,False

Hey MaximizeMe fam! So, picture this: I woke up every morning feeling like a zombie, hitting snooze on my alarm *way* too many times and scrolling through my phone until my eyes crossed. Sound familiar? 😴

Well, after reading some insightful threads (and maybe too much caffeine), I decided to flip my morning routine upside down for 30 days. And let me tell you, it was a game-changer! I unlocked an extra **two hours of productivity each day**. Yes, you heard me right!

Here’s how I did it:

**1. Early Mornings, Happy Mornings**  
Seriously, who knew waking up earlier could actually *feel* good? I went from 8 AM to 6 AM. Yep, I traded those last precious minutes of sleep for a bit of quiet time, and it was SO worth it. Nothing beats the peaceful vibe of morning hours.

**2. Ditch the Phone**  
I decided to leave my phone in another room for the first hour of my day. *No notifications, no doom-scrolling*, just me and my thoughts. I felt free and, honestly, a bit rebellious! 😜

**3. Move Your Body**  
I started incorporating a quick 15-minute workout. Not a grueling gym session—just enough to get my blood pumping. It’s amazing how a little movement wakes up your whole vibe!

**4. Fuel Up Right**  
Instead of coffee being my *first love*, I swapped it for a healthy breakfast. Think smoothies, eggs, or oatmeal. Packed with nutrients, it transformed my energy levels and kept me focused. Who knew I could be a morning chef? 🍳

**5. Plan My Day**  
With this newfound time, I started journaling my to-do list. I mean, how often do we wake up and just Wing It? Now I have a blueprint for my day, which means less time wasted figuring out what to do next.

**6. Mindfulness**  
I squeezed in 10 minutes of meditation. At first, it was tough to sit still, but wow—*calm mind, happy life*. It helped me set a positive intention for the day, like having a little pep rally before diving into my tasks. 🎉

**7. Celebrate Small Wins**  
Each evening, I jotted down what I accomplished—big or small. It felt great to reflect and realize just how much I could fit into a day when I actually took control of my mornings!

It wasn’t all sunshine and rainbows, though. There were days when I hit the snooze button like it was a sport, and I felt tempted to crawl back into bed 🛌. But reminding myself of my goals kept me committed. 

And you know what? The happiest surprise of all was how these two extra hours rippled through my entire day. More time for hobbies, more time for friends... it felt like winning the lottery of life!

So, if you're sick of drudging through your mornings, consider flipping your routine! You never know what magic awaits on the other side. Who's ready to try it out?",1,1744846084.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

Long story short: At the beginning of the year my ex partner/roommate passed away. We had separated in September, and he passed in January from a self inflicted cause. 

Upon the passing of my roommate I created a gofundme stating it was to cover funerary expenses (cremation), a memorial (to be held in June), and any living expenses he left behind. At first things were going well with his mother, but after a falling out due to her own behavior we are no longer in contact. She proceeded to make threats that if I didn’t “shut up, things would really go south”, so I told her to no longer speak to me directly at all. Since his passing I have sent her family what funds I could afford to for his cremation (500$), and all other funds went toward caring for his dog/dogs very expensive vet care (he had Lyme disease and also needed many dental extractions). She has threatened to press legal charges for misallocation of funds, and for my trespassing on the property. She has lied to her legal advisor, and to police, stating I moved out of our apartment in August (I never moved out). I have documentation to show my share of rent being paid, as well as having all utilities in my name. I also am able to procure character witness letters stating that donations were sent to me to aid in whatever I may need in this time, as well as veterinary receipts for the dogs care. I cannot afford legal representation, as I’m an independent hairstylist and a coffee manager for a coffee shop. Not exactly lawyer funds anywhere close by. Should I be prepared to lose in court?

I'm currently in **week 2**, and honestly, I’ve noticed a few things already:

* **Energy:** There’s this natural energy kick I get after taking it – kinda like a clean coffee buzz, without the jitters. It hits different but in a good way.
* **Appetite:** This one surprised me. I’ve been feeling **fuller** throughout the day, to the point where I’m not finishing full meals like I usually do. It’s been harder to eat a complete plate.
* I’ve been **semi-fasting** while taking it (not a strict schedule, just intuitive), and it’s actually helped. When I feel hunger pangs creeping in, I just drink more of the Gut Goodness mix, and that holds me down for a while.

Not making any huge claims here – just logging how it’s going for now. I’ll keep updating as I go further along.

The notes are: apricot, guava, peach, and jasmine. It was sweet and syrupy, fruity, and smooth (not muddy). At first when it was warm, it was so balanced. The fruitiness wasn't so intense, it was tea-like coffee, and as it got colder it started to become syrupy, and the peach notes slowly showed up. My girlfriend got iced latte using the same beans, and with milk I was even able to taste the peach notes better! It's almost as if there was actual peach in the coffee. It was like peach iced-tea with milk.

After that I knew I wanted to get the beans, but I've tried a couple more fruity pour overs from different cafes just to see if that's what ""fruitiness"" means, and that if I liked it. Turns out I loved them: I tried more beans from the same roaster, from dak, nomad, etc. In the end I got the peach beans. It was roasted really well and uniformly, really beautiful beans! I kept trying to make the iced latte brew with my moka pot, but it's so hard to get it right. 

I decided I want to replicate the same pour over coffee I've tried for the first time so I got a cute dripper and a kettle. My first try had no fruity notes (15g:250g, I poured 5 times, I think maybe there was no agitation from my pour and I ground too fine) but I finally got the peach from my second time! (16g:250g, 3 pours, did more agitation, and I ground the beans a bit coarser) Hopefully by my third one I will get the sweetness and the syrupy consistency! Any tips?

**Viewable memory carrier: Curie Darrius Landmine, Mechwarrior of H92 penalty battalion.**

***Date \[standardized human time\]: June 2, 2209***

***Location: planet Trelwan, Federation military training camp.***

Things are getting better. It's so good that I've even stopped swearing on every occasion.

The relationship with Ty'Lorin has gotten much better than before. She still calls me something softy, but it doesn't matter so much - at least she doesn't swear at me, thank god.

Coffee and tea are now kept under seven locks, access is now by coupon, and all thanks to the susceptibility of these short-eared little guys to caffeine.

In any case, they didn't ban 'breathing' and thank goodness for that. Some aliens still don't understand why we call smoking breathing, but they don't need to understand because they don't like it. They can still breathe next to people who are smoking, but they can't inhale even into their mouths, because their taste buds are too sensitive.

Comissar soon promised to get us a 3d printer, so that we could print things on it for household use as well as entertainment. Points for good behavior and high efficiency in battle will now be used as currency to use this printer, apparently. It doesn't bother me much - I don't get rowdy, I nod to aliens, I wear my glasses on base, I don't grin and grin with my teeth outside the barracks - being 'good boy' is about me.

That's why I don't understand why Anton needed me at this early hour. I hope he won't reprimand me for any mistakes or anything.

There's the door. Three loud, measured knocks on the door, wait for a shout of 'come in' or for the door lock to open, and only then enter.

Exactly four steps forward after the door closes, stand at attention, salute in the form of handing over the heart.

“Mechwarrior CH92-13 has arrived as ordered.” I said quietly so as not to unnerve the well-hearing Telrani.

“At ease.” muttered Anton, lifting his gaze from his personal computer screen.

The office was furnished rather futuristically, there was even a propaganda poster burning on the wall, where a man was shaking a tentacle to some alien and at the bottom you could see a clearly visible inscription 'Friends are not always alike.' The table, on the other hand, was wooden, a large oak table that I'd only seen illustrated in e-books. All in all, it was a good place to be.

“Well, congratulations Curie.” grinned my friend and pointed to the chair across from his desk. “Best behavior in the battalion, when they bring in the 3D printer you can print anything you want.”

“Thank you,” I nodded. “Can I just ask why I had to go to your place so early? It's still a whole two hours before we get up.”

“If I called you, there are some reasons for that,” my friend jokingly huffed. “Here, check it out.”

A datapad slid across the wooden table toward me. I deftly picked it up and began to read aloud.

“Cargo. Scheduled for arrival on June fifth, 2029. 3D printers, industrial for construction and standard for housewares; two Kid-class extra-heavy walkers; four Proscopian-class light walkers; two Whistler-class walking mortars. Two allied battalions: cadets of the human race and the Rattid/Mussorid races? Do we have manpower replenishment?”

“That's the only thing that confused you?”

“No, there's also a super-heavy walker confused, and mortars as well. So we're going to practice firing at some targets and teach the cadets how to drive mechs?”

“I thought you were going to talk about new aliens being brought in, but you got the gist of it right.” My friend nodded to me.

“They think the newbies should be taught by four people from a penal battalion? Toh, are they crazy over there?”

“They told me over the intercom that our battalion was sent here because there are no hardened criminals among us, just delinquent or slightly unstable professional soldiers. I wouldn't be surprised if we're joined by a couple more races or human battalions soon.”

“The Galactic Federation needs joint battalions so we can work together and fight together?” I asked understandingly. “Then I see. So we'll be lucky to get a year of training here and then we can go civilian. At least that's what the contract said.”

“Yeah, not really looking forward to being sent off to fight somewhere. The Telranis don't know how humans do war for real.” Anton agreed.

“And let them continue not to know. Of course I don't believe in a future without wars, but I don't really want to see the corpses of those little beasts.”

Anton suddenly looked somewhere to the side, apparently at the very propaganda poster, and then shook his head.

“Let's forget it. I called you here for two reasons, let's talk about the main one first - you're one of the few mechwarriors that drove extra-heavy classes of walkers. Simply put, you're one of only two instructors we have, and there's no way to get out of it.”

“It doesn't get any easier hour by hour,” I sighed. “And the second one?”

“There will soon be meetings of engineers and pilots of combat vehicles to talk about improving the technological component. We have an experimental camp, so think about various technological improvements. Anything you can think of, even infantry gadgets. Okay? I'll send this message to everyone, but I'll tell you personally to have more time to think about it. And yes, you haven't forgotten about the fact that you have another meeting with your Telrani today?”

“Are we really going to get our post time cut short just so we can talk?” I wondered, already inwardly happy about everything that was happening.

“Exactly. They'll send you new material to talk to her about. Got it?”

“Yeah, yeah, I'll write up a report later.”

“Great,” my buddy nodded. “Dismissed.”

I had already gotten up and started to leave the room, but my cheerful mood didn't let me leave without a sarcastic comment.

“Don't forget to meet your Telrani, too.”

“You little-” was all I heard before I dashed out the door and headed for the communal showers to wash up before continuing my productive day.

**Viewable memory carrier: Ty'Lorin, female warrior of the fifteenth battalion of the Telrani race army.**

***Date \[standardized human time\]:  June 2, 2209***

***Location: planet Trelwan, Federation military training camp.***

The morning was very dark. The wind was blowing hard outside: while people sometimes stopped to avoid being blown away, the Telranis were repeatedly blown away by the strong gusts of wind, without incident.

All morning we, that is, the staffers, sat around drinking human green tea, which some soldiers had provided us with, exchanging it for our drink, which looked like, as they put it, “instant yogurt.” Do they really miss the locked tea and coffee that much?

Because of the lack of things to do and the constraints of movement, we talked about everything. Surprisingly enough, some of us soon moved first to people and then to the very battle simulation we had been doing a while ago.

“People fight like animals,” complained a girlfriend of mine. “I didn't die until the very end, not only did they call in artillery fire on their infantry, but the ones who survived caught up with us and butchered us.”

“One of them clobbered me with a piece of asphalt,” one of the younger officers shrugged. “They don't bother with it at all.”

“Oh, the same stepper pilot that flanked ours?” I huffed. “Yeah, that cretin used the rocket launcher as a manipulator for the strike. That's the kind of footage I've never seen in my life, much less sitting behind turrets.”

Suddenly the same girl who had been complaining about the melee softy shrieked and hid behind the back of one of us, clearly hiding from something at the entrance.

Curie was standing at the entrance, clearly stunned by this reaction, he first checked for glasses, looked behind him, and then asked.

“Is something wrong? I came to drink yogurt, just...I'll leave if I have to.”

“It's him!” shouted the girl, who was already shaking with fear.

And then it hit me.

“So you're the man who came behind our lines?!” I marveled, setting the mug of tea on the table.

Curie patted his eyes, thought about what we were talking about, nodded understandingly, and only then answered.

“If you mean the simulation, then yes, I did. What the orders were, that's what I did.”

“Why did you clobber her with a piece of asphalt?!” asked my friend indignantly.

“I used what I had to beat her with! Or did you want me to beat her with my fists instead of a stone?” the man was suddenly indignant, but he suddenly exhaled and made a little half bow. “Please accept my apologies, but what I've already done can't be undone. Let's just forget it, shall we? I'm hungry.”

Curie headed towards the common cafeteria, since there were no cooks there right now, he easily jumped over the counter, apparently not wanting to go to the door, and began to make himself breakfast from some leftovers from last night's dinner. Did he do that often? He's got a lot of confidence.

“Come to our place right after you get your food,” I shouted to him. “It'll be boring sitting alone.”

One of my tablemates choked on her tea, the other bit her tongue instead of eating a fruit bar. Their looks were as if I'd invited a predator to the table. Oh.... and I did invite it.

Curie scooped himself up a small tray - some kind of porridge, a drink made from Darotia seeds that he called yogurt, and a couple of slices of some weird golden-colored thing and the exact same fruit bar one of my friends was eating.

“Move over, please.” he asked me, looking at the way the rest of the Talrani were afraid of him.

As soon as the young man sat down on the seat where I was sitting before, he put his palms together, closed his eyes and began to speak.

“Good food, good meat, good Lord let’s eat. Enjoy your meal, everyone.”

My coworkers' eyes went to their foreheads even more, which looked even funnier. It was the fact that the human at their table was a believer that frightened them. Anyway, I decided to lighten the mood with a little conversation.

“You didn't tell me you believed in gods.” I switched to the closest thing I could think of, picking up my tea cup again.

“You didn't ask,” he parried, gorging himself happily on last night's porridge, and he hadn't even heated it up. “Try not to believe in God when you're in the army, and even more so, you have to believe in him, even if he doesn't exist.”

“What do you mean?” expressed my friend's incomprehension for us all.

“Well look,” the man began to explain. “Belief in God agitates for what? Love your neighbor, don't kill, behave righteously. We even have a philosopher's statement about it: 'The thinking atheist, who lives according to his conscience, does not realize how close he is to God. Because he does good without expecting a reward. Unlike believing hypocrites'. No, I'm lying, it was a writer, but I can't remember his name.”

That's when I choked up. I thought the fool would never say anything like that in his life, and I guess I should be less prejudiced against predators.

“And we have no gods, we believed only in ourselves,” suddenly sat back the junior officer, who had previously been terrified of my human. “I never understood where it all came from.”

“Those classes at the university I skipped,” Curie admitted, biting into a fruit bar so we couldn't see his teeth. “It kind of starts when you try to make sense of the universe. Of the 'an apple fell on me, it must be the spirit of the apple tree mad at me' variety.""

“Let's get away from such difficult topics,” rubbed her eyes at the night Rai'Nor was on duty. “I'm getting a headache from sleep deprivation.”

“How so?” grinned softy toothlessly. “A military base after all. You don't even think about that kind of thing before you go to bed.”

“You better tell me different, human.” spoke up the most senior of the female employees. “How did you even learn to fight like that? The galaxy is afraid of predators because they're used to killing, and we used to run away from the threat. So who were you killing?”

“We were killing each other.” continuing to chew on the candy bar, the predator replied. “I hope you don't need me to tell you the reasons for those murders. I can't answer that, but I don't want to scare you or put you in an unfavorable light.”

There was an awkward silence. Everyone looked at each other in confusion, but my curiosity made it impossible for me not to ask a question.

“And yet, what did you kill for?”

“Well, let's curl our fingers.” put out the man's wizened hands in front of him. “Food, resources, monetary wealth, territory, racial hatred, entertainment, defense of one's loved ones, for an idea, out of rage, as punishment. Oops, ran out of fingers. Not ran out of reasons, though.”

Softy smiled at us with his fangs and stood up from the table, taking the tray in his hands. He took it into the kitchen, carefully placed the dirty dishes in the giant dishwasher, and as he was about to leave, he lowered his glasses, giving us an indifferent but slightly amused look that clearly sent shivers down my friends' spines.

“For the future. A man has plenty of reasons to kill, but he won't do it if given the opportunity NOT to. Have a nice day.”

The guy was already headed for the exit, but suddenly called out to me.

“Ty'Lorin, I expect to see you in your room by eight pm. I got a new movie sent to me, I'll be explaining about our holidays.”

Only then did he leave.

“Damn softy,” one of the girls finally managed to say something in a shaky voice, the antennae of everyone present shaking in unison. “Why'd you have to show your eyes?”

Shit. Apparently everyone calls them that already, softy. Yikes, hopefully they'll still remain our allies and not just eat us like we think they will.

**Viewable memory carrier: Trel'Ayn, the inferior ambassador of the Telrani race.**

***Date \[standardized human time\]: June 2, 2209***

***Location: planet Trelwan, Federation military training camp.***

  
It's a beautiful day and beautiful weather today.

Many would call it horrible because of the wind or the rain about to start, but...to me, this kind of weather has its charm. It's as wild as it is safe, treat it with respect and caution and it won't ruin you.

It's just like softy.

I've already seen my battle buddies' reports. They are afraid, even the girls who have gotten to know people better are afraid. I guess they only see them from the side they have to put up with. Or are they just unlucky with the person? My human is more inclined to recognize our fear, maybe even too much.

I wish I could talk to him. But he's probably busy. I don't care, I have to, this might be my last opportunity of the week. I don't have anything to do anyway, I'm bored out of my mind.

As I approached the hallway, I heard irritated typing on the mechanical keyboard and someone's irritated sniffling. Could he really be that pissed off about something?

I knocked gently on the door, something faintly shuddered behind it and finally I heard 'Come in'.

Anton looked rather tired. There was an unwashed coffee cup on the table, his cap and uniform were lying on the semblance of a bed, which was now assembled into a sofa.

He looked so focused that at first he didn't realize who had entered the room. Only when he looked up did he immediately change from a nervous softy into a good-natured man.

“Ambassador, what an honor,” he smiled amiably, still not showing his teeth. “What can I do for you on such a windy day?”

“Thought I'd check on you,” I said half-truthfully, looking around the strange interior. “You haven't been out of your office since this morning, and it's already past dinner.”

“Unfortunately, I don't like to leave things unfinished. The paperwork for the arrival of new battalions and equipment is being filled out.”

One of the man's eyes twitched faintly with a nervous tic, and his hands twirled the stylus around and around - people liked to sign documents too often.

“You need to rest,” I shook my head and walked over to softy almost closely.

He smelled of something strange, something that even overpowered the smell of coffee, something burnt, the remnants of green tea, and a wood scent that was even stronger than the scent of his wooden desk. Why had I even thought of that anyway?

“You know I can't.” even more gently, as if to a child he tried to explain. “The arrival of all this stuff in what seems like three days.”

I gently wrapped my arm around Anton's with mine and pulled him with me, he barely resisted, apparently still not convinced by my words.

“Let's go and have some tea,” I didn't give up. “You can't drive yourself to a nervous breakdown with all this work? Have you decided to leave it all to me?”

""But...""

“No 'buts.' I'll help you with the paperwork afterward. Okay?”

Softy finally gave in and allowed himself to be dragged along.

This is all so weird. I'm leading the predator with my arm around him, and I'm not even afraid of him, I guess I'm used to my human, and it hasn't even been a week. How embarrassing. It's a good thing everyone's in the barracks now, or else there'd be rumors I wouldn't be able to get away with.

I brought Anton into my office again, made him some green tea and sat him down in one of the armchairs, taking a seat in the one next to him.

“How strange you humans are.”

“What do you mean?” the predator didn't understand, gently taking the mug in his hands.

“You like to work yourself to death, and you make others rest during the same situations.” I shrugged and sipped from the saucer cup, too.

“Are you going to remind me of that day for the rest of my life?”

“As long as it's profitable for me,” I giggled, wiggling my antennae merrily.

We sat in silence for a couple more minutes, enjoying our tea, and then I did break the silence.

“I read that when people kiss someone, it's a show of affection. Is that true?”

Poor commissar Lebedev choked so badly that I thought he would die of coughing right in my office.

“What are you implying?” he asked through his coughing. “Are you referring to the kiss on the hand? It's usually a gesture that expresses respect, admiration, and reverence. It can mean deep respect, as well as a willingness to be there for you, to care and protect, but it can only mean love if people are closer than friends, for example.”

“So our databases have to be run through yours after all. What is it about kissing that shows love? I'm curious now, we don't even have such gestures in our culture.”

“Well,” the comissar began to curl his fingers. “On the lips, on the neck, on the shoulder, on the ear. The last three are more intimate, so they're not often used in public. We use bites sometimes too, instead of kisses.”

In the neck? My heart raced fast, fast, fast as I pictured predators approaching someone's neck with their soft lips and sharp teeth just to show their love. No scenes of violence came to mind, but my gut must have instinctively anticipated such an outcome.

“Everything okay? Your antennae are moving like crazy again.”

I immediately pinned my antennae with my hands to my head and pressed my ears against it as well.

“Sorry, I never understand how to control my instincts.”

“Never mind,” waved my human's hand. “Even humans can't always control their instincts.”

“Really? Interested, spill it. Maybe you have them too?""

“Have you ever had the sensation of something moving in the dark?” suddenly to myself the man asked.

“No. Have you ever had that feeling?”

“And I'm not the only one.” sipped the man's tea and set the mug on the coffee table, another reciprocation in human culture by our people. “It's our instinct. If you can't see something in the dark, you can't relax. Our nature will scream that there's someone sitting there, even if there's no one there, until we're definitely sure otherwise. I guess it must have gone back to a time when man wasn't the leading creature on Earth.”

“And how long ago was that?”

“Before we invented gunpowder.” The man smiled, showing me his fangs. “Now we have a saying, 'If you couldn't kill something, it means you didn't use enough explosives.'”

I shuddered, once again imagining humans hunting armored creatures with rocket launchers or anti-tank rifles.

“I'm sorry for bringing up such topics.” Suddenly the smile fell off softy's face. “I keep forgetting how cruel humans are compared to other races.”

I couldn't listen to it anymore. My body stood up on its own and headed toward the comissar. I didn't realize how I'd climbed into his arms and made myself comfortable on the predator's torso.

“Hey, what are you doing? Are you okay?” my companion was worried, but he didn't throw me off his torso; instead, he started to support me with his hands so that I wouldn't fall. 

“As much as I love this weather, I'm very cold. So lie still and don't move, predator.”

“You've got a lot of nerve.” The guy suddenly softened and leaned back in his chair, making it even more comfortable to lie down.

The softy stroked my back like I was some kind of pet. But I didn't mind, it was just nicer to bask against that big, living predator pillow. The jerk took my hand and kissed it again, making my ears perk up.

You humans are weird. So weird that you make even us do weird things.

1k0y5ji,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k0y5ji,Help choosing a rug for our space.,"Me and my girlfriend will be moving in together soon so we have decided that we want to take this opportunity to redecorate our apartment. We have purchased some things already but one thing we have been really struggling with is what rug would best fit our space. Our apartment has grey wood floors and all of the walls are white with our appliances being silver. We have purchased a couch and a lounge chair that are both white and we have a light wooden coffee table with black metal legs. We know a white or cream rug would likely work and look good but we really wanted to get a rug that was a bit colourful since so much of the apartment is already so grey. We have found a couple rugs that we like but we’re really just unsure what might work so I’m hoping maybe we can get some advice here. 

I’ve attached a few photos of the apartment to show what it looks like and I’ve also put two of the rugs we really like, with the pink one being our favourite so far. The apartment is a bit of a mess right now as we get everything ready for the move so the pictures aren’t the best but any help or advice on what might look good would be really helpful! We like bright colours and some of the smaller decorations we have bought are similar in colour to the pink rug which is what drew us to it but if it doesn’t seem like it would work we are open to suggestions.

The 3 photos are where the rug will be, with a tv on the wall and the couch next to the pillar facing the tv. And the three rugs are some of the ones we have liked but are unsure of, with the second one being our favourite.

It’s been almost 2 months since I *secretly* married my husband. Only 6 people know — just our closest friends and family. Not even our parents knows about it yet. Lol. I’m (F) 27 and my Husband (M) is 28.

Sometimes I just catch myself staring at him like, “I’m actually married to this man.” It still feels so surreal. I’m really thankful for him. No one’s ever cared for me the way he does. He always checks if I’m okay, and he massages my back everyday before I sleep — I’ve got 3 jobs and I work night shifts, so that small act means a lot. He even makes sure to make my coffee when I start working and even prepares my food. 

There are a bunch of other things that he does for me, but I mean those small acts means a lot and I secretly cry whenever I think about it. Not because I’m sad or anything. But I’m so thankful for this man for coming into my life. I never imagined that I would eventually get married someday. Let alone someone making me feel loved and understood. All the heartaches and traumas I have experienced in my past relationship doesn’t even matter anymore. He healed a part of me and made me whole again without him even realizing it. 

Alsoooo, just want to add we didn’t become a gf and bf before getting engaged. He never asked me to become his gf, he just proposed and asked me to become is wife. Got engaged December 2024 - Moved in together January 2025 - secretly got married February 2025. (Our story about how we got married is a post for another day. lol)

Hello everyone!

I bought a house a year ago, which I moved into 2 weeks after giving birth... 
The last year has been about giving lots of love to my baby, now it's time to give some love to my home!

I'd like to start by decorating my large living room on a limited budget, do you have any tips for me?

Some info :

The brick wall  has just been repainted, to hide the ""vomit"" shade that was there before.

I'd like to find a nice big solid wood coffee table, as soon as the budget allows.

I have in mind a Victoria Park frame to the left of the TV, what do you think? : victoriarosepark.com/products/comfort-of-the-coast-print

Should I hang a track from the ceiling and add curtain panels around the window (the one in the « playroom »)? If so, should the rail run the full width of the wall?

I’m actively looking for a big comfy rug, but I’m unsure what style would fit..

Eventually, we'll install hardwood, but for now it's this one that stays in place.

Thanks in advance for your help and sorry for any mistakes, English is not my first language!",1,1744844572.0,interiordecorating,2,1.0,False

1k0y3lm,https://www.reddit.com/r/aftg/comments/1k0y3lm/how_do_people_read_this/,How do people read this,"Oh lord- This is coming from someone who has read the original trilogy multiple times and was obsessed with the series for years. Now I need everyone reading this to be honest- Do you actually like the Jean/Jeremy spin off or are we as a fandom too desperate for more content? 

I liked The Sunshine Court. It felt a little empty, but still enjoyed reading it and was looking forward for The Golden Raven. But now that I’ve read like half that second book I just find myself… Being bored. It feels like there’s no plot whatsoever. Nothing is happening.

To quote my sister (who has finished the book) : “I spent the whole book being like “Ok… I guess the big thing is gonna happen here…” Then 200 pages later I was still like “Ok… I guess the big thing is gonna happen here…” Then I finished it and the whole book was just Jean going about his daily life drinking coffee and being shipped off to random people. “

It just feels so empty, unlike the first trilogy where things were actually happening. I’m not asking for explosions and gunfights, but I CANNOT go through another 200 pages of Jean freaking out when he’s offered Ibuprofen and Jeremy having yet another hook up. 

This book feels like Nora didn’t want to write it but people just kept asking and she didn’t really know what to do so she put shock value and cringe dialogue in a blender and what came out of it was this book. 

I swear to god I LOVED the first trilogy with all my heart and I really wanted to LOVE this one as well but I find myself enjoying the book only when a fox is mentioned. Please tell me I’m not going insane and someone at least shares a fraction of this sentiment.",0,1744844526.0,aftg,9,0.38,False

Last week was a shitshow of epic proportions. 

First, STBX’s affair partner’s wife finds me (that’s a lot of relationship math). Spent a few days texting back and forth and was told that it was more terrible than I thought. I also considered the source. However, it was bad enough that I felt like I needed to say something, so I called STBX, told her that I didn’t want to get in her business and I know she can take care of herself, but I heard bad things, no details, and I’d remiss if I didn’t tell her to trust her spidey sense. Then she told me what she’d heard about the affair partner’s wife. We chatted like friends. Fun. I told her that these people are all strangers to me. 

I heard something, I said something. I’m at the place where it’s not my monkeys, not my circus. 

I’m so close to that chapter being over. Probably end of May. 

LB died. Everyone is incredibly sad. She was a light in the world. 

Apparently, I owe the IRS $2700. STBX took out an incredibly small amount of withholding. 

Hung out with RM on Wednesday. We had a few drinks (not enough to get messed up), talked for hours, like we do, wound up snuggling in bed and I read to her. So much fun. I really wanted her to know I loved her, so I told her. She said she loved me, too. We always say that, but I wanted her to know I was serious. A nice evening, and a welcome respite. 

Friday, went out with RM to the BT and BP. So much drankin’. Came close to physical confrontation with a rando asshole before the bar ran him off. Not like me. At all. 

“Let’s go to the pub”.  The five most egregious words in the English language, at least when RM says them. So we do, and see more friends. She put money in the jukebox and told me to pick one. Took a minute. I’d already had enough to know I was Lyfting home, so the timeline is a little hazy. I think it was after my pick, but I looked over at the bar and saw RM engaged in a slow, eyes closed, kiss with CS. Ouch. So I went outside for a smoke, came back and  calmly asked RM, “Hey, did I just see you mouth-kissing CS?”  She says, “yeah” and my reply was “Ok”, and I walked out. 

She followed me and we talked. I was hurt. Gist is that she’s “dead inside”. I hate that for her. I hate it for me. My friend IR could tell something was wrong with me, but I hadn’t processed enough to go beyond “Nah, I’m fine”. Lyfted home. 

Alcohol. So much alcohol. Annihilate this week. 

The Lyft home is always a blessing. The Lyft to get your car in the AM is shameful and pure misery. 

The STBX calls and tells me I need to sign tax papers. She’s talking to the tax prep lady and she’s using her “sweet” voice. The tax lady can meet me shortly, so I muster myself and head over. 

This woman was the slowest person in the known universe. Combined with the fact that I’m signing the last tax returns with the ex, the blight of a bad night of drinking, the $2700 in taxes, the RM situation, it was a whole bunch of bad. And slow. Christ. 

I had to drop off the tax papers for STBX to sign, so I went to the house. I was hoping the kid would be up. Instead, the fucking affair partner’s car was parked in front of my house. Well, shit. I’m dealing with things head-on now, though, so I go inside, drop the papers, pet the dog and let him out, have a smoke. No sign of AP. Probably best. 

I go to the park and give RM a call. She was just sitting down to call me. We talked. She was very excited talking about the festival she went to and the shopping she did. So much fun. 

We were supposed to go to a friend’s house and I told her I wouldn’t be able to. She asked if I was still hurt about last night. The answer was “yes”. A lot of details in the conversation, but I thought we were building something. Apparently I was alone in that. Bummer is not the right word. 

RM texted me from the friend’s with a photo of the lovely fire and asking if I wanted to go to a Friends (Quaker) meeting on Sunday, which we’d talked about. I did, and so we did. I got a lot out of it. 

I will say that didn’t see her face the same way on Sunday. Good to know early, I guess. 

I was so glad to see last week in the rear-view mirror. Had three drinks at the BP when I said I was only getting two. Hey, people kept showing up. 

Good day at work except for sinus allergy pain and second job fires. I spent my lunch break on a call with my friend KB who was also having issues with her not-quite-significant-other. We commiserated and talked about growing and learning from these experiences. 

I got back to the office and there was a caterpillar on the back of my suit jacket. I shook it off and it landed on the floor. I wished it well. 

Listen to the universe. God is speaking. 

Didn’t drink at all on Monday. I just wanted to sleep. And sleep didn’t come. Around 2:30 I called work off for Tuesday. Slept until 10:30, and then off and on all day. Glorious. 

IR texted me and asked if I was going to BP. I told her I was under the weather and needed to dry out, anyway. I just needed to make a Publix run, which was the only time I left the house, around 9:30. 

Picked up a few things and thought, “I could use a couple of glasses of wine”. So I got a 1.5L bottle of valpolicella. Checked out, went to the parking lot, dropped the bag with the wine in it and it shattered. Luckily, all of the glass was contained in the bag.

Listen to the universe. God is speaking. 

Put my groceries in the car. Went back in and replaced the broken bottle of wine, even though I did hear that voice. 

Got home, ate a sandwich, packed my lunch, poured a glass of wine and sat on the lanai. I had a wonderful conversation with myself. 

A lot of times like this I have conversations in my head with a version of someone else. Like a construct of RM or ER or Mossy or anybody I care about. I find that in those conversations, my little inner monologue is trying to show them that I’m right or well or whatever it is I want to persuade someone I care about to believe. In retrospect, I find it performative, and that I’m performing for someone that’s not even the real person, just a construct. And then I do it to the real people, too. Shit, I told my therapist that I even do it to her. 

I always say that “our lives are strangely our own” and I’m starting to put into practice what that actually means. So I recognize when I have imaginary conversations with imaginary real people that I’ve built in my psyche and shut that shit down. I talk to myself instead. And pour another. And another. Then comment on Facebook posts. And pour another. 

Apparently, it was after 2:00 when I went to bed. I only know this because KB replied to one of my texts asking if I was ok because of the ungodly hour. I told her I was just remembering that I had left people on read and wanted to get back before I went to bed (word). Which was true. 

When I woke up the sun was shining. Which is bad. I wake up well before the sun is shining. It was 3 hours after my alarm usually goes off and I was late. My alarm was turned down and, come to find out, I’d drank almost the entire 1.5L bottle of wine. For those playing at home, that’s two normal bottles. Perfect storm. 

Got myself together and headed to work. NBD. But, shit, what a wake up call. I can’t keep alcohol in the house. It’s a bad idea. 

I get to work and I’m getting things done. I was talking with a colleague and he said that I had a caterpillar on my jacket. Just like before, I shook it off and went back to work. 

Then I thought about it. Maybe the lil guy was saying “looks like my ride is here”. Or maybe something else. 

Listen to the universe. God is speaking.

A caterpillar is symbolic. Because, what is a caterpillar? Potential butterfly, that’s what. It’s going to through some crazy changes and will come out the other side completely different. 

I can’t imagine what that process is like. It can’t possibly be pleasant. The prep work alone looks like a LOT. I don’t know if anyone has done studies on how a caterpillar feels during the process. I could probably look it up. But I hope they get to sleep through most of it. 

I did some prep work. Counseling, gym, reading, more time with family and people who genuinely care about me. With the amount of whiskey and going out with friends and the few relationships I’ve had since my marriage went to shit, I went to sleep, though. Over the past few months, which have been progressively shittier, I felt like something was changing. Maybe by learning from heartaches and setbacks and recognizing that these things are all something to grow from. I keep not asking for what I want and then doing things to get what I want that don’t actually get me what I want. So what do I do then? More of the same. I’ve done it my whole life. I ain’t doing that no more. 

Hopefully, all of this means that the cocoon is getting ready to open. I know it does, but, hey, I’ve been wrong about stuff before. 

I grabbed a coffee filter and (eventually) coaxed the caterpillar on it, then covered it with a paper towel. It was reluctant, to say the least. It arched its little back and bowed up as I tried to put the paper under it. Some incomprehensible being is guiding it to some end and it doesn’t understand. I get it. At some point it must have been exhausted and just thought “fine, I’m letting go now”. I took it outside. I guess I really was its ride. 

I was glad to help it, like some incomprehensible being has helped me. Good luck, lil butterfly.",3,1744844391.0,Divorce_Men,1,0.8,False

1k0y0bm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k0y0bm,Sujihiki Blue 1 Soft Iron clad 165mm,"Hey guys! 

I’m proudly presenting you my polishing work. 

I ordered this mini sujihiki from Iboku Blades. 

In my head, when I received it, I noticed the favy clad line and thought, I want to try to mirror polish it and make the clad line pop out in hazy white without necessarily losing the mirror polish. 

Here it is, this is exactly as I pictured it in my head. 

The blade was not straight in spine and the edge. I did try my best to flatten it out with my hands using a corner of my coffee table. I got the bevel straight but failed to straighten the spine as it needs to be. (I don’t have the wooden straightener) 

So, once I got the bevel straight, it was time to get it flat! 

I used Atoma diamond plate 140 grit and spend a considerable amount of time stroking both sides of the bevel. The hand pressure was high at the beginning, however as I was moving forward to getting the bevel flat, I reduced the pressure to pretty much just holding the bevel flat on the plate. This helped me smooth out any deep scratches from the high pressure strokes. 

Once I got the both sides flat, I moved on to Atoma 400 grit. This grit too, took me a good amount of time. I would polish the bevel in one direction and then switch to the opposite so it boosted the process (I did the same thing on 140 grit). 

Once I was done with 400 grit, things started to get easier. 

First, I used my Morihei 500 grit wet stone. Since Atoma plates don’t leave any finish except for scratches (at least on 140 and 400 grit range, 1200 grit already shows the difference in Hagane and Jigane). 500 grit Morihei wet stone left thick kasumi finish and exposed all the deep scratches that were left from 140 that I couldn’t see earlier. So I moved back to 400 grit Atoma and smoothed the surface which took me another 2-3 hours. 

Once I was finally done with 400 Atoma, I moved to Morihei 500 to see how things are and saw minor scratches but the surface was pretty much smooth. I moved straight to Morihei 1000 wet stone. 

Here at Morihei 1000 grit, I had one of the best times probably. Why? Because it’s an easy stone to use AND the bevel is already flat and smooth all you have to do is to make it even smoother. So I did. I spent two days on this stone and the surface was really good looking. 

Once I was done with Morihei 1000 grit stone. I moved to my Suisa Ohira natural stone. It’s soft and has really good cutting power. Here, my main focus was to make sure the surface was done done and prepared for my next stone which was Tsuschima. 

I did spend a good amount of time with Tsuschima and it’s such a good stone especially if you’re looking for a kasumi finisher. It’s nice and semi soft. It cuts pretty quickly and develops the slurry rather fast. It’s jigane finish is frosty and almost “liquidy” if I can say it like that. It’s not too thick either. 

Once I was done with Tsuschima I moved to Shobu Asagi. From Shobu Dani. It’s a hard stone. I thought it would prepare the surface for 7000 grit, 8000 grit and 10000 grit polishing. Ou boy I was wrong. I found to my surprise that my Shobu Asagi is only good on Hagane. Jigane doesn’t feel comfortable with this stone, it scratches it. Hagane, on the other hand, is semi mirror polished. 

So, I just pulled out my sand papers that I had ones of finest grits I could find in the house. I laid them flat on my Atoma plate and started polishing first on 5000 grit, then moved to 7000, then to 8000 and finally to 10000 grit sand paper. The surface had minor scratches which you can see in some photos but I didn’t wanna go back to Tsuschima and do it all over again. It’s a learned lesson for the future projects. 

Once I was done with polishing. I pulled out my Ohira Uchigomori finger stones. I broke one small piece and polished it on a diamond plate till it was no bigger than my nail on my pinky. Flat and smooth. I used my Ohira Uchigomori stone to develop the slurry and very gently with VERY short strokes almost like you’re having a seizure I followed the clad line on both sides and the result is the pictures you see attached. 

If you’ve read til this point, I thank you for your attention. I hope it gives you information that might help you with your polishing journey, or maybe you’re a pro polisher whom I’d love to chat with and share experiences and knowledge.

I have a question about the coffee shops in Korea that's been on my mind since I came back about a year ago.  Just as a background, I speak fluent Korean so this wasn't a language barrier issue.

So here is an interaction I had at a starbucks coex mall in Korea with my wife and kids (and the barista can see that my wife and kids are not Korean).    

me: (in Korean) Hello, can I have (few items for my wife and kids &) a cup of coffee with cream please?  
Barista: Sorry, cream?  Like, you want whipping cream on it?  
me: No, cream? like milk?   
Barista looks at me funny: you want milk in your coffee??  
me: yes, please  
Barista: OK..... sure.  Would you like it for here or to go?  
me: To go please  
Barista: OK, you can't drink that here then.  
me: come again?  
Barista: you cannot drink your coffee here.  
me and the barista stare at each other funny for a long minute.  (and I'm thinking ""you going to make me?"")  
me: ok. but my kid may eat her little treat on her stroller over there before we visit the Aquarium...  
Barista: Ah, no, you can't eat or drink here if you order to go.  
me: ok....  


So, what the heck is going on here?  The coffee with cream thing happened at every other cafe too.  Do Koreans not put anything in their coffee?  I guess they don't want my garbage in their shop? is that it?  Also, the coffee shops were quite empty just for reference.",0,1744844230.0,korea,19,0.33,False
