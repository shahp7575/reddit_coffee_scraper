I’m thinking of doing a student exchange at UNAM in 2026 and wanted to know how expensive it is in Mexico City because I’ve been told varying things:
How much is rent in coyoacan or other areas by the ciudad universitaria? How much does a coffee cost? Or a meal out in a restaurant? Is the transport expensive?

\[Disclaimer: grammar was fixed by AI\]

**Chapter 1: Journey**

**Reasons**

Everyone has their own reasons to start this lifestyle. For some, it’s just a simple desire to explore; for some, it’s a way to find their place in the world; for some, it’s a way to find inner peace and fight depression. For me, it was a combination of the desire to explore and to find inner peace to fight my depression. Let’s call it a mid-life crisis. 

My thoughts about travelling first started around October 2024, when I was at the lowest point in my life, dealing with heavy depression, stress, and mental burnout.  I felt so lost in life that I blamed everything and everyone around me, and in my confusion, I cut ties with friends and offended people I cared about. I had a therapist, but his help was not very effective. Thankfully, a friend reached out to me and told me she knew a guy I must talk to. I gave it a shot, and that person quickly made me indirectly realize that I had all the symptoms of victim syndrome. 

After this eye-opening discovery that no one had ever told me to my face, I apologized to everyone and moved on to the planning phase of what to do next.

**Planning**

All my life I knew I wanted to live next to the sea. This hypothesis was proven each time I went to Croatia for vacation. I have always found the sea to be a fascinating force of nature, full of life; its size and depth are things we often cannot comprehend. What are we humans compared to the sea? Just tiny ants trying to survive by eating and reproducing. We aren’t different from any other living organism, just a different species.

Instagram started showing me beautiful beaches, nature, and other destinations. When I looked up where those places were, I learned that it was Southeast Asia. This made me even more interested because I have always felt close to East Asian things, especially the food, anime, and the sheer beauty of the women.

It was decided; I was going. But where exactly? Where would I start my journey?

I started exploring SEA on YouTube and came across the channel of Social Samy, a German vlogger. I spent a couple of hours of my day watching his daily vlogs about Da Nang, Vietnam. There was no doubt in my mind that Da Nang was the right choice for me. Amazing food, a stunning beach, modest culture, and beautiful women. 

I called my mom and asked her if I could move home for a month or two as a transition period because I was going to Vietnam! Thankfully, she was very supportive and didn’t try to talk me out of it. It's not easy for a parent to let their child be more than 8,000 km away from home, alone in a foreign country with an astronomically different culture.

That moment, I booked the flight and told my landlord that I was moving out by the end of December 2024. Most importantly, even if I lived three streets away from the office, I worked from home, so I saw no issues with work. I made a plan to be available and work CET hours. I notified my boss that I was going, take it or leave it. Thankfully, he took it, which made a lot of things easier, and I am grateful for this.

A couple of friends suggested that I make a vlog, but I feel very uncomfortable on camera (and in front of mirrors). Still, I gave it a thought and bought a camera.

**The trip to paradise**

My flight was scheduled for February 4, and I made my first vlog a couple of days before that. I looked like a robot on camera, just sitting and talking in a not-very-well-lit room with a terrible background, but I published it and it got some traction, which motivated me to continue. In retrospect, it surprisingly got the most views (998).

On the morning of departure, I recorded a clip of me being ready to go with everything packed, and my parents took me to the Vienna airport. There, I had some issues because I needed an onward ticket, so I had to book a last-minute flight from Da Nang to Thailand and wait for a confirmation number, which took a lot of time (I barely made it to boarding). My mom was crying, and I saw that my father was holding back tears. That goodbye made me close enough to cry as well, but I was too busy to do so. I rushed to the gate, which I had no idea where it was or how I could get there. It was my second flight in my life. So, I just recorded some clips of me going through the duty-free section, then a clip of boarding and a couple of clips from the flight.

I am a hygienic person. I always wear deodorant and always take a shower in the morning to freshen up. But after the first flight to Doha, for some reason, I smelled like I hadn’t showered in a couple of weeks. It was cold on the plane, I was dry, no sweat, yet I smelled. Since I didn’t have any change of clothes in my cabin baggage, I had to go and buy a shirt and perfume. I documented this on my vlog; it was the first time I had to speak on camera in front of people. The cheapest shirt I found was 90€ and the cheapest perfume was 50€. Regardless of this huge expense, the Doha airport was stunning. I had never seen anything like that, so I explored it and recorded some clips. I was getting more and more excited. I also video-called my sister and showed her the place. 

It was time for my second flight from Doha to Saigon (Ho Chi Minh). The plane was slightly less comfortable, but it was doable. I was excited, tired, but managed to get some light sleep along the way. 

When I arrived in Saigon, the first thing I noticed was the immense heat and humid air. Coming from low-humidity -5°C to high-humidity +30°C was a huge slap in the face. The immigration process took so long (at least an hour) that my flight number was not on the baggage carousel anymore. I was looking for my bag for at least 30 minutes until I found it dropped somewhere in a corner, and then I rushed to my second flight. Even though I had seen videos about what to do and where to go, at that moment I forgot everything. I tried to ask people where I should go to catch my flight, but there was a slight language barrier. I was running up and down, outside and inside, but could not find the right place. Then someone told me to exit the building and walk across the street (other people had told me ""next building,"" but the next building wasn't the right one). So, I rushed to the end of the street where I saw a lot of terminals: Vietair, Vietjetair, Viet-something-else. I was confused. I went to the wrong terminal, and a lady pointed me to another one. I went there, but the line was already closed. Thankfully, a helpful employee let me through, helped me get my ticket checked, my baggage marked and checked in quickly, and pointed me where to go. So I rushed through security and made it 5 minutes late for boarding, however, the departure was also late! People were still waiting in line. There, a little girl asked me where I was from, what’s my name… practicing English with strangers. That was heartwarming. 

I was finally on my way to Da Nang, and funnily enough, the small plane was comfier than the big, long-range plane. When I arrived, the process was much simpler than in Saigon (their airport is very chaotic).

I was hoping to get some sunlight after 24 hours and some nice weather, but it was wet, slightly foggy, dark, and rainy. I remembered from Samy’s videos that I should not trust people who say they are Grab drivers, so I connected to the airport Wi-Fi, installed Grab, set my card details, and booked a ride to my hotel on An Thuong 1. It was cheap, like 11€ a night. I stayed there for two weeks until I found an apartment. 

**Chapter 2: The First Impressions**

**Hotel, Cash, SIM card**

The first thing after arriving at the hotel was to check in, put my stuff down, get a shower, and rush to the beach I had dreamed of for so long. It was amazing! But I was tired, so I went to sleep.

The next day, I had to find an ATM to take out some cash to pay for the hotel so I could get my passport back, and find a SIM card to have data. The city buzz was something I had never experienced. It was energizing, especially as the sun went down and the lights turned on—all the LED signs with bright colors, the honking bikes, the legendary *bun bao* man, the nice lady with the *banh mi* next to the hotel who was always smiling at me and saying hi when I walked by.

My memories here are a bit fuzzy, as a lot of things were happening during these few days: doing some work, cutting clips into a vlog… I slightly remember going to the night market near the Dragon Bridge and buying a belt.

**Initial Exploration and First Relationship**

While doing this, I realized I would need some friends. I was already chatting with a local girl (just to clarify, she was two years older than me) for a couple of days, but I didn’t trust her at first because I didn’t know who I could trust and who I couldn't. But I gave her a chance. We met, and she gained my trust. Our meetings quickly transitioned into dating. 

She was very nice, and brought me some fruit from her mother’s garden when we went for a beach walk with a view of the high-rise illuminated hotels and the slightly visible Lady Buddha in the background. It was nice, cozy, and romantic. That was something I hadn’t had for nine years back home. 

We met mostly on weekends because she was working. During the week, I was busy trying local food, walking 6-8 km on the beach almost every day when it wasn’t raining (it was raining very often, so I mostly stayed indoors), finding an apartment, and trying to find events I might like to join to find fellow immigrants or travelers that I might be on the same wavelength with. 

I was so busy during the week that I didn't really have the capacity to search for friends. Looking back, I realize that I put all my social energy into this one relationship, not thinking about what would happen if it suddenly wasn't there. But more on that a bit later.  

**Lady Buddha and Hoi An**

On the first weekend, the girl drove me to see Lady Buddha. I was a little skeptical about a 45kg girl driving a 97kg person on the back. I resisted at first, but we survived, and it was an amazing first trip!

The surroundings and the place itself were beautiful; the statue is bigger than you might think! On the way there and at Lady Buddha, we saw some monkeys. Regardless of the “Don’t feed the monkeys” sign, she and some other people were giving them pumpkin seeds. Those monkeys were a little bit aggressive, but we had a lot of fun and laughs and made some nice pictures and shots for the vlog.

The same day we were at Lady Buddha, she suggested we see Hoi An. I didn’t know if she meant today or next time, so when we arrived back at the beach near my hotel, I asked her if we were going. There was visible confusion as we talked using Google Translate, but then she took me there. 

Hoi An at night, with all the lanterns over the street and in the water with the boats, just walking through the streets, sitting down, and eating spring rolls from a very small vendor with even smaller chairs, was a nice romantic way to spend the night. At the end, she took me to a famous Banh Mi shop. The poor girl was already so tired, so we ate and went back, but it started raining. She was prepared and had two raincoats.  

This weekend was an eventful and good experience that I will remember until I die.

**My First Apartment**

During this time, I was able to find an apartment that I liked, which I was lucky to get. The apartment agent wrote to me that I had 20 minutes to arrive there, so I rushed over. There were five more agents waiting for clients. I was the first one there, so we went and checked it out. It was a one-bedroom + living room with a kitchen. It was the least smelly, least destroyed apartment I had seen so far, so without thinking, I took it. But about the dark side of the apartment, I learned a bit later, so more on this a little later. 

Meanwhile, my girl helped me buy a cheap broom, mop, and bucket because she told me Lotte Mart was expensive. She wasn’t wrong! So she took me to a local street where someone had a little market at their home where we got these things. It was a truly nice experience to shop like this and not at a big mall!

**Marble Mountains and Dragon Bridge**

I believe this was the third weekend (I arrived on a Friday, so my second week but third weekend). The weather got progressively better. I was walking around, exploring all the beaches on the main shoreline, and got burned to the bone. I greatly underestimated the UV strength here; even my eyelids were hurting. 

This day, we went to explore the Marble Mountains. It was beautiful; it was basically a temple inside a small mountain. When we went all the way up, the view was amazing, although it required some light climbing/hiking. It was again a very nice date. 

As the night got closer, the fire show at the Dragon Bridge was a good idea to spend the evening, so we went to see it, and it was again, amazing! 

**Nam Son Pagoda, Han Market and Dinner**

This was the fourth weekend, roughly one month into our dating. 

We went to Nam Son Pagoda, which is one of the most beautiful Buddhist temples I have seen in Da Nang. When we arrived, a security guard asked me to wear a big dress because my legs were exposed. I didn’t feel pretty in it, but culture needs to be respected. 

The most interesting part was a room with some pieces of paper that were pinned on the wall, probably to wish for something. I didn’t really figure it out, as Google Translate made it hard to communicate, and I didn’t do research afterward. 

Since I needed some shirts and I couldn’t find my size in Lotte, I asked her if she could help me find something bigger. So we went shopping for clothes. She got herself some, and we managed to find a place where they sell 5XL size (that’s XL in Europe). Since we were nearby, we went to Han Market.

Han Market was quite interesting, yet not a place where I want to return anytime soon. A bit dirty, smelly, and the food hygiene was questionable for a European stomach. 

I felt bad that except for my kindness and cooking one time, I didn’t contribute much on these dates, so I offered to buy her an *Ao Dai*, the signature Vietnamese dress, because she didn’t have one. We found some she liked, and it wasn’t expensive even with custom tailoring, but she declined. She didn’t want me to spend money on her. I could not change her mind. 

So, after we left Han Market, on the way home, we stopped for dinner, and at least I paid for that. It was nice noodles at a calm, empty restaurant.

**Chapter 3: Where It Went Downhill**

As I mentioned a few times, ""more on that later."" It wasn’t all laughter and balloons. 

Since I was in the new apartment, my sleep was seriously impacted. There was a Chinese restaurant below my window that opened at around 5-6 PM and closed at nearly 5 AM. Needless to say, the people who went there to eat and drink talked loudly, and mixed with the slightly louder music, I could not really sleep well. After a while, I became really sleep-deprived and easily irritated. 

Although the story above and the dates might seem perfect, the weekdays when we were apart were not that great. 

Hearing multiple times a week things like:

* “You should find a young and pretty Vietnamese girl, not an ugly old lady like me.” 
* “You will go away from Da Nang, you are a tourist, we should not date.”   This gets tiresome after almost a month. As well as her questioning every female contact I had on Zalo, which were apartment agents and one girl from Saigon I had never met and never intended to meet unless by chance I went there for a friendly coffee. So, the jealousy was a big issue for me because I didn’t feel trusted.   When I asked her, ""Do you have Instagram?"" her reply was ""No, only Zalo."" A couple of days later, she was on her phone next to me, receiving Instagram notifications.

This already made me question if I wanted a relationship that was driven by jealousy and God knows how many lies.

As mentioned before, due to my limited time during the week, I didn’t have much time to find friends, and on weekends, I spent all my time with the girl. For all these reasons, I was desperate for friends—other people I could talk to except her. 

So, I planned a night out to go to a Digital Nomad meetup at 9 PM, which was on March 8, also known as International Women’s Day. 

I offered her to hang out and have a nice dinner before the meetup, but she declined, saying she was tired from work. So, I went to the meetup and kept in touch with her, sending photos. Her reply: “Who are those girls? You told me only white guys will be there.” Well, I went there with white guys, I talked to white guys… I can’t tell girls not to come to a meetup. 

This created tension, which added on top of the jealousy and the missing self-confidence. At this point, I was almost certain that I did not want to continue this, but I gave it a night's sleep to see it with a clear head after a night out.

Later that night, a girl started to talk to me and forced me to dance, which basically consisted of me standing still while she was moving my hands. It was too loud, so I told her, ""Let’s go outside."" We had some dried squid and talked. She invited me to Ba Na Hills, which I accepted. It's a good way to find a possible friend.

The next day, I offered my girl to have lunch for the missed dinner. She declined again. She was mad at me for going to the meetup. “You have friends now, you don’t need me anymore.” 

Yet she had the chance to spend the evening with me, even if not the entire night. This made me mad, and I ended it. I asked her not to contact me again and reminded her that she had also suggested we should not date multiple times before.

She desperately tried to contact me—over 40 missed calls on Zalo and Instagram in an hour. She was calling from the afternoon until about 9 AM the next morning. After I blocked her on all platforms, she showed up at my apartment, knocking. I ignored her. 

She had to move on. I understand it’s painful if she had developed deep feelings. I have been there myself two times in my life.

The knocking on my apartment didn’t stop for a few weeks! Some days she was there (I saw her from the window, in front of my apartment building, waiting for me to go out or go home).

I started getting emails from strange email addresses saying, “You will die.” I received photos of her supposedly having an accident and being in the hospital. She tried to tell me that she had lost her ID in my apartment (it wasn’t there). She sent me messages saying she would write my name in the sand, put on her boots, and drown in the sea. She sent me emails in the third person about how people stopped her from jumping off the Dragon Bridge. She commented on my YouTube video that she was pregnant. She wrote some not-very-nice things on the Facebook page of the company I work for. 

(This literally went on for 2-3 more months.)  

**Chapter 4: Finding Friends (Not Beer Buddies)**

**Attempt Number One**

My first attempt to find a friend was the girl from the meetup who forced me to dance. 

We went to the magical French village of Ba Na Hills. I cannot even describe how magical that place was… and the buffet! Worth every penny. Hard to describe, it was like a European old town quarter converted to a Disneyland-like vibe. It was fun, except that the girl put herself into almost all my shots and also basically required me to be her cameraman. 

I met her a couple of more times to see if there was more to it, but we weren’t very compatible (religion, view on life, etc.), so we talked and decided to let it go. 

**Attempt Number Two: Great Success**

I visited a couple of meetups, and on one of them, I was adopted by a woman—let’s call her Kate for the sake of privacy.

She had enough positive energy and love to give away, so my days became brighter. This continued for four months, but let’s not skip too far forward. We shared a lot of things with each other, from basic daily things to intimate ones. I would say we were close friends.

Thanks to her, in a couple of days, I met a dear friend, let’s call him Peter. We instantly liked each other and created a group of three people who hung out a minimum of four out of seven days a week. This was pure bromance at its finest.

Time passed, roughly 1.5 months, and new people joined our trio. Let’s call them Martin and Evelina. 

During these almost two months, we were hanging out on a regular basis, having dinner or just a beach walk. It was probably the best era in Da Nang—no life stress, no work stress, just pure bliss, except for my stalker.

I also met a girl a couple of times, let’s call her Pocahontas. She was nice, smart, we liked the same music, we were able to vibe… but she had a fatal flaw. She didn’t trust me because I wanted to renew my visa by going to Thailand. Since I had bought the ticket in Vienna, I didn’t want it to go to waste. Considering she didn’t trust me, and she also told me she had been dating another guy behind my back but didn’t like him, so she chose me... I am sorry, but I don’t share. Goodbye. A month or so later, in June, we started talking again and decided to give it another try. It ended just as quickly when she revealed she was still dating multiple other guys. It was clear we wanted different things.

So, I kind of liked another girl, let’s call her Megan, and I tried my best so she would like me, but that was a dead end in the friendzone. Temporarily, she joined our five-person group because she was leaving in about two weeks. I don’t really remember the details, but I managed to catch feelings for her, regardless of her cold attitude towards me.

During this period from around March 10 to June, we went on trips. I learned to ride in this Vietnamese traffic, which could be a chapter by itself. We all had so much fun! Or at least that’s how I see it.

Sadly, we had to exclude Martin from the group because he was making moves on any woman we liked, whether they were in our group or not, and it made them uncomfortable. As friends, we wanted to protect them.

Roughly near the end of May, we were added to another group and we hung out a couple of times. I also managed to meet another girl for a friendly meet. She had a boyfriend, but her actions suggested it was a date. It was and still is confusing, but we keep in touch.

As my birthday was coming up in early June, I had a little bit more work stress, and combined with the failed dating and the girl I had feelings for leaving and ghosting me after a while, I felt down but was still able to somehow manage myself and exist. 

But a terrible accident happened roughly a week after my birthday, and Kate was hospitalized. That scared the hell out of me that it could happen to me as well, considering how many accidents I have seen here and how many irresponsible drivers there are.

This incident tipped my mental/emotional balance, and I stopped hanging out during workdays. However, I was still active and responsive in group chats and joined weekend getaways for waterfalls and similar things so I wouldn’t be too anti-social. 

Since I considered Kate my friend, after a while, I got the courage to visit her in the hospital. She instantly noticed that I felt extremely uncomfortable there and she told me so, as an open question that didn't need an answer. I, however, offered my help if anything was needed. So at least I did what I could and wrote her here and there to ask how she was feeling. 

When she got home, she was basically immobilized, and because we lived on the same street, I was told I never offered my help. That’s simply not true. Then she told me she would need some basic stuff, but I never found out what she exactly needed. 

At around midnight a couple of days later, she reached out saying she needed some boxes for packing that Peter was trying to find but couldn't. I asked what kind of boxes she needed, how many, how big, but didn't get a reply until the next day, when it was too late. I didn’t know when she was leaving, when she needed to pack… I frankly don’t have the ability to mind-read.

All I knew was that she needed to pack stuff so she could leave it at a friend’s place, so she wouldn't need to take things back to her home country or sell them and buy them again. She tried to box a shoe rack that was not possible to disassemble. I told her, ""You are basically immobilized, you are in a rush, why the hell do you want to put a shoe rack into a paper box?"" ""Because I don’t want to take it home,"" she said. I told her again, ""Where is the logic in putting furniture you cannot disassemble into a paper box? You can just simply put the entire thing at a friend’s house (and maybe he can even use it to put shoes away until she returns) and it will be less compact, because a box always needs to be bigger than the item itself, wasting space at your friend's house."" And again, her reply was, “But I don’t want to take it home!” 

While other people knew when she was leaving, I didn’t, yet almost every day I asked, ""How are you, what’s new?"" She decided not to share this information with me. There was no way we could communicate like this. So, we argued about the boxes and haven't talked since. It’s almost a month now.  

**Chapter 5: Post-Kate Rally Crash, Month 6**

Since no one knew that I was going through stuff myself and I didn’t want to put additional pressure on things, I kept this to myself. Until I noticed that from not eating, I had lost 3kg and was getting a frequent fever. Since Kate had left, which I learned from Peter, I decided to share my issues with the others. Some were supportive, some less. Overall, the trio wasn't hanging out that often anymore. The chat was closed by Kate, and we created a new one with Peter, but it wasn’t the same vibe.

So, we hung out a couple of times. I got a suggestion from Evelina to start a business. I was like, I don’t really want to, but then I gave it a couple of days' thought and came up with the idea of opening a Central/Eastern European restaurant. However, since:  a) I also want to target locals, and b) In my kitchen, I can cook only for 2-3 people, I decided to cook Goulash for three people I knew were from Southeast Asia. I created a group chat with these three people and explained why they were chosen. 

Evelina’s first message: “What the fuck man? Don’t be needy, go ask them. I have my own issues, I don’t have time for needy, mentally unstable people.” (very roughly shortened)

This was a clear sign that I am no more than just a passing-by beer buddy who is only good when she feels low and wants to drink. So, I left the common groups we had, because others wanted her company and frankly, I felt like an outsider.

We used to tease each other often with silly jokes. Once, she got offended, told me about it, and I apologized and promised it would never happen again. She clearly saw that she hurt me by saying stuff like this, but she didn’t even try to write to me and apologize. 

The other person from the food group totally ignored me and my invitation. And the remaining one was nice enough to come over, taste it, and give her honest opinion. We had a nice talk for about four hours. Since then, I have tried to chat with her, but got total silence. 

I met Peter. He was very busy with his newly found girlfriend, and I was happy for him that he had finally found someone. And even happier that he found an hour to meet for dinner. He told me about some hard decisions he was dealing with, so I told him if he felt low, just to let me know. 

Since that day, six days passed. Meanwhile, I was on a border run for a new visa. He didn’t reply to any of my messages. I was worried that something had happened to him, because let’s be real, finding one minute to reply, “Yes, I am fine, just busy, talk to you later,” is not that hard, is it? So logically, my assumption was that he had had an accident or something.

I contacted three common contacts to figure out if he was okay, until the last one managed to talk to him so he replied that he was busy looking for a job.

A couple of hours later, I see an Instagram story about them hanging out in an amusement park. I also learned that there was a goodbye party for his GF. 

So, I am asking you, the reader:  Is finding one minute to reply in six days—while being socially active (party, amusement park), being on his PC looking for a job, considering we knew each other for roughly five months and hung out a lot, him telling me “I love this guy” in front of others, having a bromance—unreasonable?

I don’t think so. This is a clear signal that the groups rejected me, just because I had some issues.

As July came to an end, marking six months in Da Nang, I was left feeling like I had no real friends and no trust left for building a new connection. The story, however, wasn't over.

**Chapter 6: The July Dance**

In July, I met a new girl. She invited me over, promising to cook for me before we had even met in person. True to her word, when we met, she cooked a wonderful meal. We met again for a beach day, went for a swim, and went back to her place.

But a strange pattern emerged. When I invited her out for a trip, she would decline. Then she would invite me over, and I would decline, wanting to go out. I invited her out again, and again she declined. It seems she only wants to be at home, while I feel a desperate need to be outside after being inside all week. For the last three weeks, we have been stuck in this strange dance, not moving forward, not ending it.

P.S.: I met a girl from my country here. She had to fly back home, but we stayed in touch, often spending two hours on video calls. Before her flight, we were actively chatting, and she told me she was so happy to meet me again. After the plane landed, she met everyone but not me. Her replies were once a day or two.   

P.S.2: Frankly, the hurtful truth is, you cannot trust anyone. You are only good for people until you have positive energy, and if something goes wrong, go f\*ck yourself.",1,1753705423.0,expats,0,1.0,False

I’m Lorithar, a Protection Paladin on Kazzak-EU, and by day (and let’s face it, many late nights) I’m tanking mid to high-end Mythic+ dungeons - over 3100 Mythic+ rating in The War Within Season Two so far. For context, that puts me above the Keystone Legend threshold of 3000 rating - not quite in the top 0.1% ""Enterprising Hero"" club, but close enough to smell the ozone from their auras. I’ve also dabbled in PvP on the side, enough to appreciate the adrenaline of arenas (and to have my pride handed to me by spry Rogues and Priests more times than I’d like to admit).

Why mention both? Because this is a forever ongoing debate in the WoW community that I find myself drawn into often: Which is tougher, high-end PvE or high-end PvP? In other words, is timing a Mythic+22 key ""harder"" or ""easier"" than climbing above, say, 2400 rating in 3v3 arenas? As someone who’s taken plenty of beatings from raid bosses and players, I figure I’d share my personal take. **Don’t worry, this won’t be a ""PvE master race"" rant or a ""PvP git gud"" sermon**. Instead, I want to talk about the **different flavors of difficulty in Mythic+ versus PvP**, with a dash of humor and a dose of real-talk from a tank who’s seen both sides.

*(Credentials established? Check. Coffee in hand? Check. Let’s dive in, it's gonna be a long one!)*

# Achievement tiers and what 3100 rating means

Before we get into the meaty bits, let’s set the stage with some quick facts. Mythic+ (M+) uses a rating system each season, and The War Within Season Two has a few milestone achievements that Mythic+ players chase:

* Keystone Conqueror (**1500 rating**) - A mid-tier feat that grants the title ""the Enterprising"" . (Yes, you become enterprising at 1500, hold that thought for later irony.) 
* Keystone Master (**2000 ratin**g) - A major benchmark that rewards a shiny mount (the Crimson Shreddertank spider-tank!) . This is the seasonal ""KSM"" many players gun for. 
* Keystone Hero (**2500 rating**) - A step beyond Master . No mount here, but considerable bragging rights (and it contributes to a meta achievement for additional rewards ).
* Keystone Legend (**3000 rating**) - New in Season Two, indicating you’ve truly conquered M+; rewards the Enterprising Shreddertank mount (a recolor of the 2k mount) . Hitting this is a big deal – it means you’ve likely timed all the season’s dungeons at pretty high levels.
* Enterprising Hero (**Top 0.1%**) - A feat of strength for ending the season in the top 0.1% of all Mythic+ ratings . This one awards the exclusive title **the Enterprising Hero** to wear with pride (and probably a touch of smugness) . Only the elite of the elite will have this by season’s end.

So when I say I’m sitting at 3100+ rating, that means I’ve cleared well above the usual ""endgame"" level for Mythic+, pushing into territory where every dungeon run feels like a tightrope walk. It’s given me a solid perspective on what high-end PvE demands, and it’s made me appreciate the brutal pace and unpredictability of PvP, both firsthand and through relentless feedback from my PvP-heavy friend group. **Now, let’s talk difficulty: PvE vs PvP.**

# PvE vs PvP – predictable scripts vs player mind games

One argument I hear a lot: ""Mythic+ is scripted; PvP is dynamic. Obviously PvP is harder!"" It’s true that PvE encounters are pre-designed. Dungeon bosses and trash mobs don’t improvise, they have abilities that fire in set patterns or triggers. In Mythic+ you can study these patterns, watch a YouTube guide, install a boss mod, and pretty much know exactly when, say, Boss X will unleash that killer AoE or when the next wave of mobs will spawn. The predictability means you can come prepared with a game plan. As one fellow player succinctly put it, ""PvE is mostly predictable… PvP is more reactionary"" . I can literally plan my Divine Shield usage for a dungeon boss well in advance; in an arena match, however, I’m reacting to humans doing human things - like suddenly swapping targets or pulling off an unexpected crowd control chain.

That unpredictability in PvP is no joke. Players adapt; they learn your tendencies, fake you out, and generally refuse to behave like scripted NPCs. No addon can tell me with certainty 

>xxWarrior\_Killer69xx is about to Fear you in 3…2…1… 

the way DBM or WeakAura can for a boss mechanic. This means in PvP, your perception and quick reads are constantly tested. PvE rewards planning; PvP rewards adaptation.

However - *and this is where the discussion gets spicy* \- predictability does not equal easiness. High M+ keys are brutally difficult in their own way, even though you ""know"" what’s coming. It’s a bit like knowing all the notes to a Beethoven sonata; performing it live, flawlessly, under pressure is another matter entirely. In M+, the difficulty is dialed up by raw numbers - mobs hit harder, timers are tighter - to the point that execution has to be nearly perfect. In fact, M+ has an infinitely scaling difficulty curve. You can keep raising the key level until eventually the dungeon becomes mathematically impossible to beat. Mythic+ can scale to the point of near-certain failure - +40s are basically impossible. In PvP, there’s always a sliver of a chance, even against top players. That’s the nature of human unpredictability.

So is that kind of ""impossible if cranked high enough"" difficulty harder or not? It depends on your definition. **Personally, I find that PvE and PvP test different skill sets**. In PvE (especially M+), success comes from planning, strategy, and execution of a known script under intense pressure. In PvP, success is more about adaptability, quick decision-making, mind games and outplaying an opponent who’s trying to do the same to you. One is a marathon dance routine, the other is a spontaneous duel. They’re both hard, but hard in different ways.

# Group Coordination and Mental Load

Let’s talk teamwork and the joy of ""herding cats"". In Mythic+, group coordination makes or breaks you. As a tank, I'm usually the one calling pulls and hoping the DPS remember how to interrupt or dodge fire. One missed kick or sleepy healer can turn 30 minutes of precision into instant regret - key bricked, run over, heart broken. Arena is similar - smaller scale, but just as demanding in coordination, with less margin for error.

There's also the fun blame game. In Mythic+, the tank blames the healer, the healer blames the tank, and everyone blames the DPS. In arena, blame often turns into collective sighs and shared facepalms, since you typically play with consistent partners. Either way, failing hurts, though at least arenas end quickly, whereas a failed high key means waving goodbye to half an hour of your life.

Finally, mental stress differs greatly. Mythic+ stress is a 30 minute endurance test where one mistake ruins everything. PvP is all spikes and split-second calls. I’ve sweated through both - neither is for the faint hearted.

# Tools of the trade: addons and ""Easy Mode"" myths

Let's talk about addons for a moment, the elephant in the Mythic+ room. A common criticism of PvE content is that it’s somehow ""easy mode"" because tools like Deadly Boss Mods and WeakAuras shout every mechanic at you (""Run away, little girl!"", you've probably heard it a thousand times). And you know what? Those addons absolutely make the game easier. In fact, they've become so powerful and widespread that Blizzard has had to design encounters to be increasingly complex just to challenge players who rely on them.

Personally, though, I've mostly [tanked my keys](https://youtu.be/L3J1qQETCM8?si=N784z2bwVvyvd6ZY) without using these addons \**cough\*plater\*cough\**. It's not some hipster badge of honor (okay, maybe a little), but I've found that playing without a screen cluttered by warnings and timers actually helps me focus better. Without addons, every pull feels like reading the battlefield in real-time; tracking casts, positioning, and mechanics through pure game sense rather than a flashing alert. It might sound crazy at 3100+ Mythic rating, but it works for me.

*(Feel free to check out my low addon UI video -* [*here*](https://youtu.be/2u8vZ7tdYKk?si=NgTMQ3pwD3-sat0q)*, totally not a shameless plug tee-hee)*

PvP players use plenty of addons too: cooldown trackers, DR timers, arena frames; but they don’t predict behavior. PvE mods, on the other hand, broadcast scripted mechanics, which inflates encounter design around them.

But here's the core problem: as PvE addons become more sophisticated, Blizzard must design increasingly punishing mechanics to challenge players who use them. It's an arms race, UI complexity versus encounter complexity, and the game suffers for it. Players who don't use these tools face an uphill battle, while those who do may find the game cluttered, stressful, and overloaded with information.

Does that mean addons eliminate skill entirely? No. But their existence undeniably shapes WoW's design and raises the bar of difficulty artificially ( to be changed soon! ). My stance is simple: if an addon becomes mandatory, the game's design, not the player, is at fault. After all, if addons really could play the game for you, I'd be sipping drinks on a beach in Gadgetzan, selling ""Lorithar’s Automated Tanking Service"" instead of doing keys.

In the end, real skill - PvE or PvP - is about your ability to read situations, react quickly, and execute under pressure. Addons or not, the best players still shine through.

# Why the comparison isn't the whole story

So why argue about PvE vs PvP difficulty at all? Honestly, it usually boils down to pride and a bit of insecurity. WoW offers multiple endgames, some players focus on Mythic raids or pushing keys, others dedicate themselves to arena rankings. Everyone wants their chosen path to be recognized, which often leads to downplaying the other side.

The truth is, these comparisons miss the point. Skill in WoW isn't one-dimensional. Ultimately, both forms of content are optional, challenging, and meant to be enjoyable. WoW thrives because it supports multiple playstyles, each community enriching the game differently (and occasionally driving developers crazy... sorry, Ion!).

# Two paths to glory (let’s not gatekeep fun)

At the end of the day, comparing high-end Mythic+ and PvP doesn't lead anywhere productive. Both are challenging, require deep skill, dedication, and can give you a genuine thrill when you succeed.

As a Mythic+ tank who's pushed beyond ""a casual player"" rating, I'll say this clearly: PvE is absolutely skill intensive. Coordinating pulls, timing interrupts, managing cooldowns, and reacting perfectly under intense pressure, it's competitive gameplay at its finest.

Yet, I have huge respect for PvP players too. Trying arenas made me appreciate their skill, adaptability, and quick thinking even more.

**World of Warcraft is richer for having both PvE and PvP. Instead of debating ""which is harder,"" let's just acknowledge and respect the effort and skill required in both paths, and remember to have fun along the way.**

What is your take on the subject?

Hope that’s ok.

\- We drove from Pittsburgh to Cincy Friday straight to our Air BnB in the Northside. Cleaned up, changed and then headed to the Hi-Mark on our way to Riverbend for a concert. We found Hi-Mark on our last weekend trip to Cincy about 6 years ago and really loved the food and vibe and we’re excited to get back. Food was great! Beer choices were unfortunately meh, but the disappointing part was the service. We got there about 3:00 and there were literally 4 other people in there. Bartender didn’t address us and was all in all attitude-y and nonexistent. Kind of ruined it for us. Oh well.

\- We parked in the very first lot at Riverbend. It was hotter than hell in Riverbend, luckily we had seats under the pavilion section. Concert rocked. Hot as hell and sweaty all night. We actually got out of the lot pretty quickly which was good.

\- Saturday we walked to the Blue Jay in Northside for breakfast. Great vibes, GREAT service. French toast was fine. Coffee was diner great, goetta was sooo good and the Blue Jay Special was very, very tasty. Great spot.

\- Went next door to Shake It Records and WOW what a fucking gem! One of the best record shops I’ve been to on my travels. HAD lots of stuff on my list, ended up with a Manchester Orchestra album and a t-shirt for me, hoodie for my partner. Seriously amazing record store!

\- American Sign Museum next, which remains my favorite museum / cultural institution anywhere. It’s my jam and I love it! The expansion is ridiculously well done and the curation is A+. We timed it right and did the tour at Noon which was impressive and Gabby, the tour guide, was wonderful!

\- Swung my Union Terminal to check it out – super cool, and we continue to be struck by what a fantastic way to continue the life of the building and repurpose it.

\- Drove to Clifton to hit up Skyline and Graeter’s. Coney was delicious. Graeter’s is always good!

\- Back to Northside to hit up Urban Artifact. Good beers, board games, vibes.

\- Northside Yacht Club for dinner. No AC so hot as fuck in there, but so, so, so worth it. I can honestly say the wings (we got Parmesan Garlic) were some of the best food items we’ve had. I feel like referring to them as simply “wings” undersells how fucking delicious they were. I’d drive back to Cincy just for those damn wings. Tofu wrap was killer too, great fries and our server gave us a free PB Tequila shot, which was surprisingly unreal good. Tried buying a Medium t-shirt, but alas they did not have that size :( If they restock and someone wants to send me a Medium t shirt I’d venmo you the money, haha!

\- Sunday was a trip to Findlay Market on our way out of town. Grabbed some goetta to go at Eckerlin and some breakfast sammies too which were delicious – hot mett and of course goetta breakfast sammies. Really liked the mett, which we don’t have in Pittsburgh. Was like a cross between a hot dog and kielbasa. Got some other stuff. Also paid $8 for a small as waffle at the Belgium place. Yummy waffle, but $8 is ridiculous.

LOVED the trip. Had to adjust bc of the stifling weather. We planned on Goettafest but it was just too damn oppressive outside. Super excited to go to Northside Yacht Club. We planned on going back to Hi-Mark, but the disappointing service on Friday, swayed us to stay closer and hit up Yacht Club. What a decision that was!

Thanks to everyone for the recs! We’re excited to get back to Cincy again and explore more neighborhoods / areas! This time sooner than 6 years. Cheers!",4,1753705323.0,cincinnati,0,1.0,False

TL:DR Flatmates has been making me pay council tax even though I'm a student so that she can still afford nice things and splash out for herself despite making me financially worse off 

Hey everyone some context.

Ive (21M) been living with my flatmate (22F) since September. I am a student  ( graduated last week) who works part time (18hrs) and she works full time (30hrs) and before we moved in I agreed to help with council tax as she told me she was on minimum wage and wouldn't be able to pay council tax fully by herself. She sorts out all the council tax as I sort out rent, bills and I felt it was fair if she had a responsibility. However after an incident on my birthday I feel like she's been purposely taking advantage of me and I'm not sure what to do 

I first sent her £130 in January to go towards our payment of £300 and she had told me she'll pay a an extra £40 to be 'nice' ( I've since found out the first payment was £260 so she didn't pay any extra just told me she had to look like she'd done me a favour ). She also told me after I sent the money that this was the only thing we had to pay. 3 months later we move house and once we move in informs me we still have to pay an extra £324 ( £162 each )for the previous house, she said she knew there was more to pay but thought she'd already 'sorted it out and it'd be fine'. I was obviously a bit shocked and annoyed but said I could find the money and make it work, I also spoke to her about being more communicative with me about these things because it's annoying to find out you have a large sum of money to pay out of the blue while the other person has had months to prepare and save. She also has tendency to tell me important information at the very last minute, for example she said she'd look for movers as I was busy with exams and then 2 days before we are due to move I ask her how much it is for the van and if she's found one to which she tells me 'no can you help look, I've been looking G' leading me to have to sort it out ( the same thing happened with the cleaners ). I told her again to communicate more about these things and that her procrastination about house tasks affects me because I have to deal with exams,work, packing and now on too of that looking for these services last minute. In this conversation I told her I'd rather not help her with every task she does but if she can't do it herself let me know so I can either help or sort it out myself.

I ask her repeatedly the next 4 months when I need to send her money for the council tax from the last house and how much council tax is for new house as that way I can know how much to save,  if I need to pick up any extra shifts and if I should even look at getting another job. She kept on telling me that she'd let me know and it's not that much and our security deposit return from the old house should cover it all anyway. Anytime I ask she is dodgy but I don't say anything because I had more important things like work and my dissertation to deal with and couldn't handle this other stress on top of it all.

4 months have passed and it's my birthday and go for a drink with my flatmate, during the day she had got me a card calling me the best flatmate ever and praising me for this stuff etc. At the pub I tell her that I have a lot less shifts this August as because I work with young people as a support worker during the summer holidays I naturally have less shifts, and I say while it's annoying from a financial perspective it's okay because I have enough for August's rent and saved a good amount ( roughly £550 ) and it means I can go visit my family in Italy and spend time with friends something I've been postponing for many reasons. She choses this moment to tell me that we still owe money from the old house and it's now increased ( an extra £50 each) because we missed the payment; I also have to transfer her £800 to pay for this flats council tax as we aren't able to pay monthly because she missed the first 3 payments so now has to pay it all upfront. It doesn't end there though, she also tells me that I'll have to owe her £50 every month for the next 9 months to pay off the rest of the council tax. 

Some other important context is that I'm autistic, people with autism can be more vulnerable to exploitation and manipulatiaion as they ( at least for me personally ) struggle understanding social nuisances or rules particular when the behaviour of others could be considered concerning I also have difficulty understanding my needs and how something is making me feel and translating it in a way others can understand. I'm also naturally trusting ( borderline naive ) and eager to help out and go the extra way which while I find a good trait especially for my work has made it easier for others to use me for something and leaving me feeling weird without being fully aware of it.

I couldn't tell you what was actually said after that conversation at the pub but I think vaguely I brushed off the conversation as it wasn't something I wanted to discuss on my birthday and she also started crying when telling me this and I didn't want to comfort someone on my birthday especially after all they got me for my birthday was debt. Since that conversation last Wednesday I've been doing some digging because it all didn't add up. Here are the main things that I discovered that really make me feel like I've been taken advantage off.

1. When I first sent her the £130 she didn't use all of it for council tax but rather kept some for herself
2. She had been on universal credit for 3 months during our time living together, she was recieving extra money to specifcally help with living costs and stopped receiving it because she failed to meet the conditions of the Claimant Commitment
3. She was not earning minimum wage but rather £2 above ( which still isn't a lot but does make a difference especially when you've convinced someone to help you out on the basis you earn minimum wage)
4. I do all the cleaning and maintenance of the flat and acquired all the furniture
5. She's been very stingy with me in the past saying things like if your friends come down and use any coffee, oil, toilet paper( communal kitchen items that we take in turns buying ) she won't buy the next lot of these items as I used them more. Which seemed fair until the same standard wasn't applied to her.
5 1/2. She threw away all my posters when we moved and didn't buy anyback because it's unfair to make her pay for something that's an accident.
6. A mutual friend told me she spends £300 in a day once a month as a treat yourself occasion and on top of that sounds £60 on every night out ( roughly 3 times a week). For context after essentials (rent,bills,therapy) I have around £300 as my disposable income.
7. Had told her a couple weeks before my birthday that I'd have to go to therapy less as it was getting to expensive
8. Our old landlord sent us money for repairs that she kept to herself and didn't tell me until after we moved out.
9. We've been friends for 4 years now and the first present I ever got from her was this year and it was her telling me I'll be in debt to her.
10. Despite her earning more and working more and me being part time and a student she wanted to split council tax 50/50 as she felt it was more fair to split every house cost equally.

So what do I do? Do I refuse to pay council tax, move our after my tenancy, work it through, don't do anything? It seems wrong that I've been financially worse off this whole year just so that she could be financially better off

I have a Barista Pro that's a couple of weeks old.  I've got some crap store-bought coffee beans, and two two-week-old bags of Ecuadorian & Guatemalan beans.   Up till today, no matter what I did, every, single, dang, shot - ever - came out tasting like it was infused with a Warheads candy.  

I've turned the inner burs down to #1, and I'm now sat on an external course setting of 5. Temp is set at maximum.  

I've got a scale, I've been measuring both the grind output and the brew output - I gave up on this for now, as it made/makes zero difference.  

I'm a complete n00b/boob when it comes to espresso at home - so, naturally, I just thought it was me, and trial & error would eventually get me on my way.  That ""was"" a big no, sort of.  

Along the way, I've bought some puck screens, and today my naked (off-brand) portafilter arrived.  I've only pulled two runs since I gave in and went down to the internal bur setting of 1 and moved it up to 5 on the dial as the last time I was only getting about 50% output from the grind at anything lower.  

As soon as I got the naked porta, I decided to make myself another lemon tart and see how it goes.  I used the store bought crap beans, I didn't measure, just filled the porta until I could tamp it down to about 60% full (so little grind that I had to use the inbuilt tamper that fits inside the portafilter to tamp it down) - still not near what I was getting at a courser grind, but I just wanted to see what would come out of it.  

BITTER, oh sweeet BITTER glory.  For all of one pour.  I decided to go back to a second and made sure that the portafilter was filled proper - closer to 18g this time, and tamped down to about 5mil from the top.  And there it is, again.  Sour, I ran an extra 1-shot worth of water through it to drown it out (which actually worked for once) but I am ever so confused.  

I realize that the beans I have (not the store bought junk) run on the more acidic side of things, but how is it so hard to get something drinkable from such a basic & easy to use machine?  

I'm happy to take any thoughts/advice that ye might have.  One thing to note, every time I have made a shot, I always think that the liquid temp just isn't quite hot enough.  I've read quite a few forums/posts that denote any measurements need to truly be done with a scace at the group head/puck, or the readings will be too low and likely aren't valid - when I measure the water with a meat thermometer from a blank shot, i'm seeing 71C'ish and cooling from there.  No clue if this is valid/interesting, or not.

For the most part I’ve always been good at drinking fluids/ staying hydrated as opposed to most of my family who I would class as permanently dehydrated, living of coffee and soft drinks for the most part and drinking them sparingly, probably no more than 1.5-2l a day even in hot weather, so considering this possibly I urinated a healthy amount whereas they didn’t. 

I mention this as I’m speculating the cause of my current issues and possibly since birth I’ve had underlying bladder issues.

I recall a spell when I was around 7-8 where I would lie in bed at night and feel the need to urinate constantly but there was nothing actually to pee out/ my bladder was empty. This lasted around a week and just seemed to go away.

I recall another spell when I was around 12, for a few days I had a “heavy” feeling/ some difficulty urinating. I recall my diet was terrible at this time and I would often need to poo at school, which was a no go. Hence I could often hold stools in for 3-4 days. From what I remember I had a massive stool after having difficulty urinating for 3-4 days and it went away after that.

When I was around 13 however I had a similar scenario of terrible diet, holding stools in as I didn’t want to go in school and have weird kids looking over the stall and ended up being constipated as a result (as well as difficulty urinating again). 

I presumed it was a similar issue to what I had when I was 12. I took laxatives and passed a large stool however the issue of difficulty urinating was still there. I took laxatives for 5 days or so presuming there was just so much stool to pass I had to give it more time.

Yet the issue never went away and since then it’s gotten worse.

I recall I lived with it for around 6 months until I realised it wasn’t going away. I went to see my GP who referred me to a urologist or some sort of specialist but my referral was rejected. This was during Covid so possibly there was just no availability.

I recall I went on another 1.5-2 years or so and while it was a little difficult to pee, it wasn’t too bad and for the most part I could just live with it. 

However around September 2023 it began to get worse. I recall it was harder to pass urine and I often took 2-3 attempts to feel I had emptied my bladder. This frustrated me as I was often late for lessons at school or caused queues at the toilet as I took ages to pass urine. It also massively affected my sleep as I would lie there trying to sleep and couldn’t as I usually urinate before going to bed and felt my bladder was only say half emptied. 

I took the strategy of getting it over and done with and so would often stand in the bathroom for 30-60 minutes before bed trying to empty my bladder. Some of it was likely psychological. I also imagine trying to empty my bladder 20+ times in this “short” period did me no good.

I would also often wake in the night and be up for 1-2 hours with the same issue. I was always tired at school. 

I realised I couldn’t live like this and contacted my GP for an urology referral. I waited around 7 month as the NHS seems to be in a right mess recently. I saw a urologist around March/April 2024 who seemed in a massive hurry, was in her office for a matter of minutes, she barely asked questions to gain any understanding of my situation, did a quick examination mentioning my urethra appeared narrow.

I went back a few weeks later for a flow test. While I had considerable difficulty passing urine, the test apparently came back with a good result and no further action was taken. 

I went on a further few month till August 2024 and again realised I couldn’t carry on living the way I was. By this point I recall I was straining so hard to pee I would often defecate myself. I would have to clean this up, so I could spend 10 minutes in the toilet just to have a pee. 

I again asked for a referral and waited 9-10 months or so  just for a 2 minute phone call appointment, which was in the first half of June this year (2025).

Again I spoke to the same urologist who couldn’t get of the phone quick enough. I was told to document a chart of all the fluid I drank and passed per hour for 3 days and booked in for another flow test a few weeks later.

This time the flow test was considerably worse than the last one with the flow completely stopping and starting 2-3 times from what I recall. 

I’ve just heard back from the urologist today and all they said was I drink too much.  It’s summer in the UK, I go to the gym often. I carry a lot more muscle than the average person and eat a lot more. As a result of this I drink between 4-5L of fluid which at least in my mind I don’t find unnatural. I speak to a lot of gym people as well as see individuals online who drink similar amounts and seem to have no difficulty urinating. 

They advised me to drink no more than 2L a day which I find ridiculous for someone with my lifestyle, but possibly I’m wrong. I envision if I drank this amount I would feel extremely dehydrated. All these issues I’m having and I find it a joke that’s all somebody with a medical degree can advise me to do. 

I am frustrated and I’ve had these issues for 4-5 years now and from where I’m standing the NHS has done nothing. The urologist likely does not know most of the stuff I’ve documented here as they have never taken the time to ask.

1mbeii1,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_erepresent/comments/1mbeii1/coffee_bags_wholesale_a_costeffective_solution/,Coffee Bags Wholesale: A Cost-Effective Solution for Growing Coffee Businesses,"As the demand for high-quality coffee continues to rise, coffee businesses are constantly seeking new ways to enhance their offerings and streamline operations. One such strategy that can greatly benefit growing coffee businesses is purchasing coffee bags wholesale. Whether you're a small local café, a coffee roaster, or an online retailer, buying coffee bags in bulk can significantly reduce costs and increase efficiency. Let’s explore why opting for wholesale coffee bags is an excellent choice for your growing coffee business.

**1. Cost Savings and Affordability**

One of the most significant advantages of purchasing coffee bags wholesale is the substantial cost savings. When you buy in bulk, suppliers often offer significant discounts, which can translate into lower per-unit costs. This allows coffee businesses to save money, enabling them to allocate resources to other crucial areas, such as marketing, product development, or expanding their product range. The savings from wholesale purchases can add up quickly, especially when dealing with large quantities of coffee bags.

**2. Consistent Supply and Convenience**

Running out of packaging materials can be disruptive to your business, leading to delays and lost sales. By purchasing coffee bags wholesale, you ensure that you always have a steady supply of bags on hand. This consistency helps streamline your operations and prevents interruptions. Wholesale purchases also offer convenience, as many suppliers will handle large orders and deliver directly to your location, saving time and effort in sourcing smaller quantities.

**3. Customization Options for Branding**

Wholesale coffee bags can be easily customized to reflect your brand’s identity. Many suppliers offer options for custom printing, allowing you to design bags that feature your logo, unique artwork, or even special messaging. This creates a professional and polished appearance for your products, helping you stand out in a competitive market. Custom coffee bags can also be a powerful marketing tool, increasing brand recognition and customer loyalty.

**4. Bulk Packaging for Sustainability**

As sustainability becomes increasingly important to consumers, many coffee businesses are opting for eco-friendly packaging. By purchasing coffee bags wholesale, you can take advantage of environmentally friendly materials, such as biodegradable or recyclable bags. Buying in bulk reduces the need for frequent orders, which helps lower your carbon footprint. Offering sustainable packaging options can also attract environmentally conscious customers and improve your brand’s reputation.

**5. Flexibility and Scalability**

Whether your coffee business is just starting or rapidly expanding, buying coffee bags wholesale offers flexibility and scalability. With wholesale options, you can adjust your order quantities based on demand, allowing your business to grow at its own pace. The ability to scale packaging supplies as your customer base grows makes wholesale purchasing a reliable solution for businesses at any stage.

In conclusion, investing in **coffee bags wholesale** is a cost-effective, efficient, and flexible strategy for growing coffee businesses. Not only does it save money, but it also offers consistency, branding opportunities, sustainability, and scalability – all key factors in establishing a successful coffee brand.",1,1753704784.0,u_erepresent,0,1.0,False

Today’s question:  
**If you're eating for longevity, should you sip coffee or matcha?**

# What I found 

**Coffee**  
✅ Linked to longer lifespan  
✅ Supports liver & brain health  
✅ May reduce type 2 diabetes risk  
⚠️ Higher caffeine = potential jitters or sleep issues

**Matcha**  
✅ Loaded with antioxidants (like EGCG)  
✅ Promotes calm, focused energy (thanks to L-theanine)  
✅ Helps reduce stress + supports fat metabolism  
⚠️ Pricier and can be an acquired taste

# So, which should you choose?

Both have serious benefits — but it depends on your stress levels, caffeine tolerance, and health goals.

🔎 I used the **Foodhak app** to break this down based on science and biology — highly recommend if you're serious about eating for the long game and guess what it's free!

1mbeexz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1mbeexz/is_my_flatmate_is_taking_advantage_of_me/,Is my flatmate is taking advantage of me?,"TL:DR Flatmates has been making me pay council tax even though I'm a student so that she can still afford nice things and splash out for herself despite making me financially worse off 

Hey everyone some context.

Ive (21M) been living with my flatmate (22F) since September. I am a student  ( graduated last week) who works part time (18hrs) and she works full time (30hrs) and before we moved in I agreed to help with council tax as she told me she was on minimum wage and wouldn't be able to pay council tax fully by herself. She sorts out all the council tax as I sort out rent, bills and I felt it was fair if she had a responsibility. However after an incident on my birthday I feel like she's been purposely taking advantage of me and I'm not sure what to do 

I first sent her £130 in January to go towards our payment of £300 and she had told me she'll pay a an extra £40 to be 'nice' ( I've since found out the first payment was £260 so she didn't pay any extra just told me she had to look like she'd done me a favour ). She also told me after I sent the money that this was the only thing we had to pay. 3 months later we move house and once we move in informs me we still have to pay an extra £324 ( £162 each )for the previous house, she said she knew there was more to pay but thought she'd already 'sorted it out and it'd be fine'. I was obviously a bit shocked and annoyed but said I could find the money and make it work, I also spoke to her about being more communicative with me about these things because it's annoying to find out you have a large sum of money to pay out of the blue while the other person has had months to prepare and save. She also has tendency to tell me important information at the very last minute, for example she said she'd look for movers as I was busy with exams and then 2 days before we are due to move I ask her how much it is for the van and if she's found one to which she tells me 'no can you help look, I've been looking G' leading me to have to sort it out ( the same thing happened with the cleaners ). I told her again to communicate more about these things and that her procrastination about house tasks affects me because I have to deal with exams,work, packing and now on too of that looking for these services last minute. In this conversation I told her I'd rather not help her with every task she does but if she can't do it herself let me know so I can either help or sort it out myself.

I ask her repeatedly the next 4 months when I need to send her money for the council tax from the last house and how much council tax is for new house as that way I can know how much to save,  if I need to pick up any extra shifts and if I should even look at getting another job. She kept on telling me that she'd let me know and it's not that much and our security deposit return from the old house should cover it all anyway. Anytime I ask she is dodgy but I don't say anything because I had more important things like work and my dissertation to deal with and couldn't handle this other stress on top of it all.

4 months have passed and it's my birthday and go for a drink with my flatmate, during the day she had got me a card calling me the best flatmate ever and praising me for this stuff etc. At the pub I tell her that I have a lot less shifts this August as because I work with young people as a support worker during the summer holidays I naturally have less shifts, and I say while it's annoying from a financial perspective it's okay because I have enough for August's rent and saved a good amount ( roughly £550 ) and it means I can go visit my family in Italy and spend time with friends something I've been postponing for many reasons. She choses this moment to tell me that we still owe money from the old house and it's now increased ( an extra £50 each) because we missed the payment; I also have to transfer her £800 to pay for this flats council tax as we aren't able to pay monthly because she missed the first 3 payments so now has to pay it all upfront. It doesn't end there though, she also tells me that I'll have to owe her £50 every month for the next 9 months to pay off the rest of the council tax. 

Some other important context is that I'm autistic, people with autism can be more vulnerable to exploitation and manipulatiaion as they ( at least for me personally ) struggle understanding social nuisances or rules particular when the behaviour of others could be considered concerning I also have difficulty understanding my needs and how something is making me feel and translating it in a way others can understand. I'm also naturally trusting ( borderline naive ) and eager to help out and go the extra way which while I find a good trait especially for my work has made it easier for others to use me for something and leaving me feeling weird without being fully aware of it.

I couldn't tell you what was actually said after that conversation at the pub but I think vaguely I brushed off the conversation as it wasn't something I wanted to discuss on my birthday and she also started crying when telling me this and I didn't want to comfort someone on my birthday especially after all they got me for my birthday was debt. Since that conversation last Wednesday I've been doing some digging because it all didn't add up. Here are the main things that I discovered that really make me feel like I've been taken advantage off.

1. When I first sent her the £130 she didn't use all of it for council tax but rather kept some for herself
2. She had been on universal credit for 3 months during our time living together, she was recieving extra money to specifcally help with living costs and stopped receiving it because she failed to meet the conditions of the Claimant Commitment
3. She was not earning minimum wage but rather £2 above ( which still isn't a lot but does make a difference especially when you've convinced someone to help you out on the basis you earn minimum wage)
4. I do all the cleaning and maintenance of the flat and acquired all the furniture
5. She's been very stingy with me in the past saying things like if your friends come down and use any coffee, oil, toilet paper( communal kitchen items that we take in turns buying ) she won't buy the next lot of these items as I used them more. Which seemed fair until the same standard wasn't applied to her.
5 1/2. She threw away all my posters when we moved and didn't buy anyback because it's unfair to make her pay for something that's an accident.
6. A mutual friend told me she spends £300 in a day once a month as a treat yourself occasion and on top of that sounds £60 on every night out ( roughly 3 times a week). For context after essentials (rent,bills,therapy) I have around £300 as my disposable income.
7. Had told her a couple weeks before my birthday that I'd have to go to therapy less as it was getting to expensive
8. Our old landlord sent us money for repairs that she kept to herself and didn't tell me until after we moved out.
9. We've been friends for 4 years now and the first present I ever got from her was this year and it was her telling me I'll be in debt to her.
10. Despite her earning more and working more and me being part time and a student she wanted to split council tax 50/50 as she felt it was more fair to split every house cost equally.

So what do I do? Do I refuse to pay council tax, move our after my tenancy, work it through, don't do anything? It seems wrong that I've been financially worse off this whole year just so that she could be financially better off

when my gf got here, i made a contract with my older sister to warn her whenever my gf & i wanted to copulate, so to speak. she would go hang out in the living room (which has a huge comfy couch, a table & coffee table to work from,  And she could hang out with the cats). we promised to do the same for her when her gf flies in from the US.

so far, we’ve waited for the house to be empty to enjoy ourselves but she was here today. we were both restless, so we asked her if she could move her work to the living room for 30min because she’s working from her bed. my room & hers are next to each other and connected by a wall. my gf & i are normally quite loud and conspicuous and we both want to preserve our privacy and her peace of mind.

we asked her if she would mind moving 2 or 3 times, and every single time she replied that she wouldnt and that we should wait at least two hours while she finishes up. she seemed irritated and refused to talk about it. both of us have appointments in said hours, and my parents get home soon after they end. now was our only real chance in three days.

edit: she had asked us to go to the living room and fuck on the couch with a towel, which we declined because it’s nasty and EVERYONE uses that space. my mom also comes home from work early and the living room is the first room past the front door. the only other room would be my mom’s, which EW.

Edit 2: my gf lives in the us, we can’t go to hers. Also hotels in a big city are expensive and we’re both broke college students.

we put on white noise, closed the windows, turned on the fan at max capacity, and did our very best to fuck silently and quickly. i have doubts about how quiet we really were. we were much quieter than normal but not totally silent (havent mastered that yet).

Usually, I'm too chiicken to say anything, but this time, someone actually called him out. It was like a mini social experoment right in front of me, lol. I started thinking about how this kinda behavior actually reveals a lot about human psychology.

First off, waiting in line has this unspoken rule... it's like a norm that keeps everyone in checck. But then, when someone breaks it, it's interesting to see how people react. Like, everyine was giving the dude the stink eye, but only one person actually spoke up. It's almost like a test of social conformity. Most of us just let it slide, maybe 'cause we don't wanna cause a scene or whateever.

And there's this tihng in social psychology called ""diffusion of responsibility."" It's where peple are less likely to take actiin when others are around. Makes me wonder if that's why we don't immediately confront line cutters 😅. Maybe we just hope someonne else will do it for us. 

I dunno, it's just fascinating how a simple line can show us so much about group behavior and social norms. Like, what would happen if nobody cared abouut these unspokdn rulees? Would chaos reign?

I’m currently going into the 4th year of my Bachelor’s degree, and I had absolutely zero PM experience prior to this.

This made the task quite daunting, and even after reading a lot of success stories on this subreddit, I wasn’t too sure if I would be able to pass at the first attempt. That being said, I definitely exceeded my expectations and I’d like to thank all the awesome people on this subreddit who helped me be a little more reassured knowing that there were people who came into this with the same level of experience as me and succeeded.


Here are the study materials that I used:

• Andrew Ramdayal’s Udemy Course: Absolutely worth it, Andrew is an AMAZING teacher, and while I did find some of the content a little dull (the ITTOs primarily), he definitely helped by making it interesting and engaging enough to listen to. If anything, I took away from his course that Bob and Mary need help and I need to communicate the help they need. There are a few typos here and there, which make it a little difficult at times, but overall I HIGHLY recommend this as your pathway to the 23 hours.

• ProjectPrep.Org: Found this randomly googling, and MAN was it helpful, they have a free downloadable prep pack containing cheat sheets, formula sheets, and a pretty challenging mock exam as well as links to other resources to learn with, and they don’t charge you a DIME, definitely recommend using their stuff, a free mock exam ALONE is worth it.

• PMI Study Hall: I bought this for the equivalent of about 40 USD, and there are some things that are great about it. The flash cards were helpful, the gamification was a fun way to brush up on terms and they give you access to one mock exam as well, but the content on there really isn’t worth any more than like 20 bucks at most. In terms of actual tests, they had like 15 questions for each section (predictive, agile, analytics etc.), 3 10-question mini-tests and a full length mock but it still wasn’t enough in my opinion. 

• LinkedIn Learning mock exam: They had some pretty challenging questions but definitely not the most challenging. I don’t see any reason why you shouldn’t use this though, it’s completely free and there’s no cons.

• TIA CAPM Simulator: This was HARD. Like it was harder than the actual test, TIA definitely beefed up the difficulty to overprepare you on purpose, which I thought was good and bad at the same time. On the one hand, I did really badly at the start even after finishing most of my prep which was discouraging because it felt like all the hard work I put in up to that point wasn’t nearly enough, but at the same time, by studying to beat TIA’s hard-ass simulator, it made the actual test easy in comparison.

• PocketPrep Premium: GET. THIS. Even just a month of access is enough, the fact that you can do questions on the move, while pooping, while eating lunch, it’s perfect and the questions are actually challenging unlike a lot of other “short form learning resources” you see online. I’d say if you do about 95% of the questions and get 80-85% right, you’re more than ready to schedule your test. 


How I prepared:

I started by just DOING questions on PocketPrep, no studying, I went in completely unprepared, no knowledge about PM, and I did around 40 questions. I think I got right around 20-21 right, and I got them right purely by deconstructing the language of the questions, and matching synonyms of the key words in the questions to the choices. I also just picked answers that made logical sense. The fact that I got 50ish % right told me that I knew more than I thought.

Then, I watched Andrew’s course. I didn’t take notes, I took his advice and made a conscious effort to UNDERSTAND the concepts rather than memorize what goes where, and it was helpful.For example, rather than memorizing ITTOs, I understood what each process did and that gave me a good idea of what ITTOs were typically going to be involved. 

Then, I did the flash cards on PMI, and focused on just being able to define the terms in my own topsy turvy, convoluted way. I only revisited concepts that I literally couldn’t remember. For example, I didn’t really know exactly what Theory X was but X reminded me of everytime I hear someone talk about their “manipulative and controlling ex” and that stuck. If you asked me what Theory X was, I’d say they were manipulative controlling asswipes who wouldn’t let me spread my wings. Not right, not really wrong either, but I would know it when I see it. 

Then, I did ALL the mock exams I listed above and did PocketPrep whenever I found the time and didn’t feel burnt out of studying, and I ended up doing it a lot more than I thought I would.

CRUCIALLY, I didn’t study on the weekends. I think this really helped because getting away from CAPM for two days out of the week helped me avoid tedium.

On the day of my exam, I made sure to eat a light but filling breakfast (Avocado Toast and whey mixed into Greek Yogurt), poop before my exam and drink ginger tea instead of coffee. 


Here are my tips for the exam:

• You’re going to have a lot of extra time, so don’t worry about the calculation questions, take your time on them. I ended up finishing the first half with a half hour to spare and the second half with 40 minutes to spare, so take it from me, you can spend like 5 minutes on a calculation or a question you’re unsure of if you want to. 

• BE. WHOLESOME. If you can discuss with someone, find a collaborative solution or overall just be Barney the Dinosaur, it’s probably the right answer. 

• As I mentioned, it is a language test first, a logic test second and a CAPM test third. I lost count of the amount of questions that were dead giveaways because the questions were worded in such a way that as long as you took the test in a language that’s second nature, you’ll probably get like at least one T even without studying.

• Don’t over prepare. I think doing mock exams and questions has way more value than studying. Watch the prep course, go back if you’re REALLY shit at something, but you should be spending like 60% of your time answering questions, that’s where the money is at. 

• Don’t waste time after studying, the moment you average like an 80% on your mocks, schedule your test the next earliest time you can, that’s you at your best, use it before you wilt away.


Hope this helps someone!

1mbe9we,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitnessplates/comments/1mbe9we/lifepro_waver_vibration_plate_exercise_machine_my/,Lifepro Waver Vibration Plate Exercise Machine: My Honest Review,"So, you’re thinking about getting a vibration plate, huh? Maybe you’ve seen those TikTok videos where people swear it melts fat while they just *stand there* (if only, right?). Or maybe you’re like me—always on the hunt for low-impact ways to stay active without wrecking your knees.  

Well, I’ve tested my fair share of vibration plates (yes, it’s a weirdly specific hobby), and the **Lifepro Waver** is one of the few that actually lives up to the hype. Want to know why? Let’s break it down—no fluff, just real talk.  

---  

## **Why the Lifepro Waver Stands Out**  

First off, not all vibration plates are created equal. Some feel like a cheap massage chair at the mall, while others (like the Waver) actually deliver results. Here’s what makes it special:  

### **1. Waver Vibration Technology (Not Just Buzzing Around)**  
Most budget vibration plates just shake you up and down—kinda like a paint mixer. The Waver uses **oscillation technology**, meaning it moves in a smooth, wave-like motion. This is *way* better for muscle activation and circulation without feeling like you’re being rattled apart.  

### **2. 99 Speed Settings (Because One-Size-Fits-All is a Lie)**  
Whether you’re a newbie or a fitness junkie, the **adjustable speeds** let you customize intensity. I started at level 20 (baby steps) and now hover around 50—trust me, your legs *will* feel it.  

### **3. Whisper-Quiet & Stable (No Annoying Your Downstairs Neighbor)**  
Some vibration plates sound like a helicopter taking off. The Waver? Barely a hum. Plus, the **suction cup feet** keep it locked in place—no awkward sliding mid-workout.  

### **4. Full-Body Workout (Yes, You Can Actually Tone Up)**  
You *could* just stand on it and call it a day, but why stop there? Pair it with the included **resistance bands** for arms, or try squats, lunges, and planks. (Pro tip: Do a plank on this thing—your core will hate you in the best way.)  

👉 **Want to check it out for yourself?** [Here’s the link to the Lifepro Waver on Amazon](https://amzn.to/4mfzRL8).  

---  

## **Who’s This Thing Actually Good For?**  

### **✔️ People Who Hate Cardio (But Still Want Results)**  
If running feels like punishment, this is your cheat code. Studies show vibration plates **boost circulation, aid lymphatic drainage, and even help with weight loss** when used consistently.  

### **✔️ Seniors & Rehab Users (Low-Impact = Win)**  
My 65-year-old mom uses hers daily for **joint pain relief and balance improvement**. Since it’s gentle on the knees, it’s perfect for anyone recovering from injuries.  

### **✔️ Office Workers (Bye-Bye, Dead Butt Syndrome)**  
Sitting all day? 10-15 minutes on the Waver **gets your blood flowing** and wakes up those dormant muscles.  

### **❌ Who Should Skip It?**  
- Pregnant women  
- People with severe osteoporosis or blood clots  
- Anyone with a pacemaker (safety first!)  

---  

## **My Personal Experience (No BS)**  

I’ve been using the Waver for **6 months**, and here’s the real deal:  

- **Muscle soreness? Gone.** I use it after leg day, and recovery is *way* faster.  
- **Energy boost?** Surprisingly, yes. A quick session in the AM wakes me up better than coffee.  
- **Weight loss?** Not a magic fix, but it *does* help with stubborn areas when paired with diet/exercise.  

Is it a miracle machine? No. But for **$200-ish**, it’s one of the best investments I’ve made for home fitness.  

---  

## **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)**  

### **What are the key benefits of the Lifepro Waver?**  
Improved muscle activation, better circulation, lymphatic drainage, weight loss support, pain relief, and recovery. Basically, it’s a **Swiss Army knife for fitness**.  

### **Is it suitable for beginners?**  
Absolutely! Start slow (10-15 mins/day) and gradually increase intensity.  

### **What exercises can I do?**  
Squats, lunges, planks, stretches—even arm workouts with the resistance bands.  

### **Any downsides?**  
If you’re expecting a six-pack from just standing on it… manage those expectations. **You still gotta put in work.**  

---  

## **Final Verdict: Worth It?**  

If you want a **low-effort, high-reward** fitness tool that actually works, the **Lifepro Waver** is a solid pick. It’s quiet, adjustable, and legitimately helps with recovery and toning.  

👉 **Ready to give it a shot?** [Check it out here](https://amzn.to/4mfzRL8).  

And hey, if you end up loving it as much as I do, shoot me a message. I’ll send you my favorite **5-minute Waver workout** that leaves me sore for days. 😉

[Beijing keeps up rare earths pressure on Trump](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/beijing-keeps-rare-earths-pressure-070000045.html)

[Xi Jinping has been accused of ‘weaponising’ China’s magnet resources - Susan Walsh\/Associated Press](https://preview.redd.it/d7o6w6zs8lff1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=80fb02afd670c07f7cbd7e3035193230720b9039)

China is restricting the export of critical minerals to the US as it seeks to maintain pressure on the White House ahead of trade talks this week.

Despite [Donald Trump striking a deal with Beijing](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/06/11/us-and-china-back-to-square-one-after-two-days-of-trade-tal/) to resume rare earths imports last month, new figures show that China has restored trade at a far slower pace than with Europe and the rest of Asia.

China exported 3,188 tonnes of rare earth magnets worldwide in June, representing a 158pc jump from May. Of that total, 353 tonnes went to the US, an almost sevenfold increase from the previous month’s low of 46 tonnes.

But the average monthly shipment to the US in the first three months of this year was 622 tonnes, suggesting trade is barely back to half the typical level.

The June tonnage was also still 52pc below the amount shipped to the US in the same month last year, representing the largest year-on-year decline of any of China’s major magnet customers.

Germany, the largest buyer, received 764 tonnes, up almost threefold from May and down just 25pc year-on-year.

Poland, France, Hungary and South Korea also received large boosts to shipments, and had lower year-on-year declines than the US.

“While China’s relationship with the US seems to be warming, Beijing will continue to keep a tight grip on critical mineral exports,” said Leah Fahy of Capital Economics.

China dominates the production and processing of rare earths, and [controls most of the world’s supply of rare-earth magnets](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/04/21/china-threatens-countries-appease-trump-trade-war/) used in military weapons, renewable energy generation and electric vehicles.

When Mr Trump threatened China with wide-ranging tariffs of up to 145pc earlier this year, [Beijing responded by halting rare earths exports](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/06/04/trump-cornered-china-weaponises-rare-earths-dominance/).

This led to the President quickly caving in amid criticism from American manufacturers. He said on June 11 that he would slash tariffs to restore full access to rare earths.

Meanwhile, Chinese vice-premier He Lifeng will meet US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Monday for two days of trade talks in Stockholm.

Mr Bessent has described the two superpowers’ trading relationship as “in a good place”, with reports emerging late on Sunday that they have agreed to extend their truce on tariffs by another 90 days. It had been expected to expire on August 12.

Ahead of the talks, Mr Bessent has said he wants to address China’s purchases of Russian and Iranian oil.

Mr Trump has threatened 100pc tariffs on countries that buy Russian oil.

If this levy were imposed on China, by far the biggest buyer, it could reignite the trans-Pacific trade war, and risk jeopardising rare-earth trade once again.

***Ms Lahy said China’s rare-earth powers might diminish over time.***

“There’s only so many times China can go back and forth, using it as a way to get things out of the US, without annoying the US even more,” she said.

“And even if China starts supplying as many rare earths as it did before, the genie is out of the bottle. The West knows that China can limit its exports of these goods whenever, so they’re going to look to diversify their supply chains.”

Mr Bessent also wants to confront Mr He in Stockholm about what he said was “overcapacity” at Chinese factories.

The US Treasury has criticised Beijing for lavishing subsidies on its manufacturing industry.

***By skewing the Chinese economy towards production and exports ahead of consumption, this helps fuel China’s hefty trade surplus with the US – which Mr Trump loathes.***

***Beijing is taking steps to address this.***

# JULY 27th, 2025~China Strong-Armed Japan Over Rare Earths. It’s a Lesson for the U.S.

[China Strong-Armed Japan Over Rare Earths. It’s a Lesson for the U.S.](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/china-strong-armed-japan-over-rare-earths-it-s-a-lesson-for-the-u-s/ar-AA1JmhzG)

[Japan did a deal with Lynas Rare Earths, which has a processing plant in Western Australia.© Carla Gottgens\/Bloomberg News](https://preview.redd.it/r2l4fp4p7lff1.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=a0b84df362e0a354274adf95e651a66a5ed4489f)

TOKYO—The U.S. found out this year that China could use its chokehold on rare-earth minerals as a [coercive tool](https://www.wsj.com/world/asia/trump-china-rare-earths-0cbf3f3c) when Beijing imposed export controls. For Japan, it was déjà vu: It had been the victim [15 years earlier](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704049904575553792429346772).

Tokyo vowed in 2010 to be ready for next time and over the years put hundreds of millions of dollars into Australian supplies.

Yet as of last year, it was still relying on China for some 70% of its imports of rare earths, which are widely used in electronics, cars and weapons, according to the government-owned Japan Organization for Metals and Energy Security. When China restricted rare-earth exports in April, some of Japan’s automakers again got hit.

Japan’s experience drives home lessons for the U.S., where the Pentagon [recently agreed to take a stake](https://www.wsj.com/business/us-rare-earth-producer-texas-58796240) in Las Vegas-based MP Materials so it can mine and refine rare earths on American soil.

Tokyo found that partially reducing dependence still leaves Beijing with plenty of leverage. At the same time, complete independence costs billions of dollars, not millions. After the crisis passed and China resumed exports to Japan, the urgency to diversify supplies waned.

That points to the danger of complacency in the U.S. After it was hit by Chinese rare-earth export controls earlier this year, the U.S. recently got Beijing to [reopen the spigot as part of a trade deal](https://www.wsj.com/world/asia/china-to-approve-exports-of-controlled-items-to-u-s-b2f37389).

If costs don’t matter, cutting reliance on China might be feasible, but businesses can’t swallow high costs, said Kazuto Suzuki, a professor at the University of Tokyo’s Graduate School of Public Policy.

People in Japan “understood that there was a vulnerability, but everyone still relied on China because the conclusion was that there weren’t other options,” Suzuki said.

Four decades ago, a Japanese scientist named Masato Sagawa invented the most powerful type of permanent magnets containing a rare-earth element called neodymium. The breakthrough underlies the magnets widely used today.

By early this century, it was China, not Japan, that had come to dominate supplies of the 17 rare-earth elements as well as the refining of the metals and manufacture of magnets containing them. In 2009, 85% of Japan’s rare-earth imports came from China.

Beijing realized it had a diplomatic tool and used it in 2010, when a Chinese trawler collided with Japanese patrol vessels near islands controlled by Japan and claimed by China. Japan detained the captain and crew, sparking a diplomatic clash. Japanese users of rare earths reported severe delivery disruptions, although Beijing denied doing anything.

The captain was released under Chinese pressure, and tensions eased after a few months. But Japan sought alternative suppliers.

“We’re going to pursue a variety of risk hedges,” said Japan’s foreign minister at the time. “It isn’t good to lean too much on one country.”

Tokyo’s biggest initiative from that era was a deal with Australia’s Lynas Rare Earths that, in hindsight, helped somewhat but didn’t go nearly far enough or contribute quickly enough to undercut China’s dominance.

The government body now called the Japan Organization for Metals and Energy Security, or Jogmec, as well as trading company Sojitz provided Lynas a $225 million loan to secure rare earths for Japan.

The Lynas project didn’t help Japan with securing a subset of rare-earth elements known as heavy rare earths, which are generally less common than the light ones. [The heavy elements include dysprosium](https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/dyspro-what-why-an-obscure-element-has-the-ev-industry-in-a-panic-70623bf4) and terbium, which are commonly used alongside neodymium, a light rare-earth element, in strong permanent magnets.

The rare-earth elements tend to be intermingled. Miners are reluctant to invest in specialized equipment for processing the relatively small quantities of heavy rare earths that they extract alongside the light elements.

[Some of Japan’s automakers recently got hit by Chinese export curbs.© Agence France-Presse\/Getty Image](https://preview.redd.it/1rslte9x7lff1.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b272f645e4013ed2c58f69abeb7b15406956f50)

Meanwhile, in the field of rare-earth magnets that Japan had once led, it actually deepened its dependence on China after the 2010 showdown.

Japan’s biggest companies formed partnerships with Chinese magnet makers in the 2010s, reasoning that they could protect themselves from political blackmail if they had friends in China with secure supplies. Among the deals was a joint venture formed in 2013 by Tokyo-based TDK with China’s state-backed Rising Nonferrous Metals Share.

The Japanese companies had production know-how that made them attractive partners at the time in China. Afterward, China’s dominance grew. In 2013, Japan’s share in the global neodymium-magnet market was at 23% while China held about three-quarters. By 2021, Japan’s share fell to 15% while China’s rose to about 84%, according to government figures based on data from research firm Fuji Keizai.

It took more than a decade for Japan to do something about the gap in its policy. In 2023, the Japanese government body, Jogmec, and Sojitz invested an additional 200 million Australian dollars, equivalent to around $130 million today, in Lynas. The company recently started to produce dysprosium and terbium, up to 65% of which is headed to Japan under the deal.

Separately, Jogmec and energy firm Iwatani said in March they would invest 110 million euros, equivalent to $129 million, in a subsidiary of France’s Carester to support a project that could supply a fifth of Japan’s demand for dysprosium and terbium.

Japan now says it wants to beef up production of neodymium magnets, develop magnets using smaller amounts of rare earths and step up recycling.

# FORM YOUR OWN OPINIONS & CONCLUSIONS:

# (Thinking) NioCorp's 12 week Infill Drill program started 4/2025 should be winding down soon...  & it will take a few months to compile additional info leading to a ""Hopefully early as possible 2025 DFS (Oct.-Nov. guess??? T.B.D.)""

Here's a clear and concise summary of the situation with **NioCorp’s updated Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS)** and its importance, particularly in light of their ongoing **infill drilling program** and potential catalysts:

# 🧭 Why the Updated DFS Matters So Much

NioCorp’s 2022 DFS laid a strong foundation, but it lacks critical updates needed to unlock major downstream steps such as:

# 🔑 Missing in the 2022 DFS:

* ✅ **Updated CAPEX & OPEX** (inflation-adjusted costs, accurate project economics)
* ✅ **Revised NPV & IRR** based on full-scale operations
* ✅ **TiCl₄ production potential** (titanium tetrachloride)
* ✅ **REE (rare earth element) separation, tonnages & byproducts**
* ✅ **Recycling strategies** and processing improvements
* ✅ **Eligibility criteria** for U.S. **DOE / DoD funding programs**
* ✅ **Engineering specs, EPC contract readiness**
* ✅ **RailVeyor and construction scheduling details**

# 📈 Current Position: 2022 DFS (Baseline)

* ✅ **TREO (Total Rare Earth Oxide) Resource:** **632,900 tonnes**
* ***This makes NioCorp the 2nd largest proven REE resource in the U.S.\*\*\*\*\*\****
* 🔍 Based on data from 14 infill drill holes

# 🧪 2025 Drilling Program Enhancements

* 🛠️ 9 new infill boreholes underway (expected to wrap up around July 29, 2025)
* ➕ That’s a 64% increase in drill data density
* 🎯 Goal: Validate and possibly expand:
   * Grade consistency across the ore body
   * REE content (including valuable HREEs)
   * Vertical and lateral continuity
   * Potential new byproduct zones (e.g., scandium, titanium, niobium)

# 🚀 Why This Matters for the 2025 DFS

If these new boreholes:

* 🔬 Confirm or exceed the grades and mineralization seen in the 2022 DFS,
* 📊 Add new tonnage to the measured or indicated resource category,
* 🧠 And are incorporated into a revised mine plan...

Then the updated DFS could:

* ✅ Show a substantial increase in total TREO tonnage
* ***📈 Elevate NioCorp's REE standing (possibly largest U.S. domestic resource if tonnage increases significantly)***
* 💰 Justify greater government backing, including:
   * DoD Title III funding
   * DOE grants
   * Ex-Im or UKEF export credit support

# 🔑 Strategic Implications

* 📍 REE independence is a national priority for the U.S. and allies. If NioCorp can upgrade and expand its TREO resource base, it becomes:
   * More strategically relevant
   * More attractive to offtakers (especially in defense, EVs, wind, electronics)
   * More likely to secure non-dilutive funding
* 🏗️ A stronger DFS also lowers risk for:
   * Commercial debt lenders
   * EPC firms
   * Institutional investors

# 🧠 Final Thought

# That would move NioCorp closer to becoming America’s flagship critical minerals project, at a time when the world is scrambling to secure rare earth supply outside of China.

# GIVEN recent shared responses below to questions asked May 22, 2025

1. Is NioCorp continuing to work behind the scenes to complete final OFF-Take agreements for all probable Critical Minerals (Nb, Ti, Sc, REE's & Byproducts production) with both private & govt. entities? Can shareholders expect material news on the completion of such endeavors in the coming months ahead?  

RESPONSE: 

# ""Yes""

***2) Did NioCorp participate in the recent \~ (Notice of Request for Public Comments on Section 232 National Security Investigation of Imports of Processed Critical Minerals and Derivative Products***)  [Federal Register :: Notice of Request for Public Comments on Section 232 National Security Investigation of Imports of Processed Critical Minerals and Derivative Products ](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/04/25/2025-07273/notice-of-request-for-public-comments-on-section-232-national-security-investigation-of-imports-of)

***Offering commentary in either public or private format?  as over 495 responses are registered as we await U.S. govt. clearing responses for viewing....***

Nung ako na mag-o-order bumalik si lola sa counter complaining na bakit VAT lang na exempt pero wala iyong 20% discount ng senior. May threat agad si lola na bawal yan, nasa batas yan, pwede ko kayong ireklamo sa BIR. Intimidating agad si lola nung lumapit. So nakikinig lang ako. Nag explain iyong barista na iyon ang lumalabas sa system nila kapag ineencode niya. Ineexplain niya ng maayos at super polite pa. That time wala iyong supervisor niya dahil kumuha ng supplies. Dalawa lang silang nakaduty. I can see na tinatry niyang ayusin kino-compute niya manually iyong dapat na discount at iapply iyong code pero since wala supervisor niya, di niya override. (Correct me if I'm wrong, pero un ang understanding ko na kapag staff ka, wala kang access to override or do whatever sa system.)

Nageexplain pa si barista nung biglang lumapit na si lolo at iyon rin ang bungad niya. Na kesyo labag sa batas, na pwede siyang nagreklamo sa BIR. Taas agad boses ni lolo. Sakto kakabalik lang ni supervisor with supplies nung nagrereklamo na si lolo. Tinatry na nung supervisor ayusin pero si lolo nagsasalita pa rin.

I get it, right niya iyon as a senior at pinaglalaban niya lang. Pero sumabat ako when he threatened the staff. Sabi niya bigyan daw siya ng OR at irereklamo niya daw sa BIR ilagay din daw nung barista pangalan niya dahil isasama niya daw sa reklamo. Sabi ko kay lolo ""sir, I think hindi niyo naman po need idamay mga empleyado. Company lang kasi system nila yan"". I know hindi makakapagsalita iyong dalawa lalo si ate barrista kaya ako na nagsalita for her. Hindi ko alam kung mali ba ako pero naawa ako sa barista at nagalit ako sa sinabi nung matanda nung tinakot niya. 

Ang hinahon ng pagkakasabi ko, may ""po"" pa, ginalang ko pa. Sabi saakin ng lolo ""bakit ka nakikisabat? Sino ka ba? I'm not asking for your opinion!"" Ehdi sumagot ako ng ""sir, nasa public po tayo at nasa harapan ko po kayong nag-aaway"", pero he is still not asking for my opinion daw. Okay sige, kahit ineexplain rin ng supervisor na tinatry nilang ayusin kasi iyon talaga ang nasa system nila. Nakakaawa lang on their part, naipit sila dahil may kapalpakan sa system at ngayon sila ang napag-iinitan. 

Nung umupo na si lolo, si lola ang naiwan sa counter kasi inaayos nga nila iyong resibo, kausap ko iyong barista reiterating my opinion na bakit idadamay siya sa reklamo samantalang sinusunod lang siya sa system. Dapat sa company, wag idamay iyong barista.

Eh si lola nakikinig sa usapan namin, may senyas ata kay lolo kaya lumapit ulit tapos tumayo na likodan ni lola at nagtanong ng ""ano?"" Habang tumitingin sa akin. So inulit ko ulit sinabi ko. He is still not asking for my opinion daw so ang tanong ko, ""bat po kayo lumapit dito?"" Hindi siya sinagot tanong ko at inulit na he is not asking for my opinion. So sumagot na akong pabalang ng ""okay. Pero bakit kayo lumapit?"" Tapos tumatawa na ako, pang asar ba. Then umupo na ulit si lolo

Ito na si lola. Sabi sa akin ""don't argue with him, he's a lawyer"" nung sinabi ni lola iyon, napa ""ahhhhhhh"" na lang ako. 

Pigil ako magcomment ng ""ganon na ba kapag walang kliyente? Makikipag-away para sa discount? Ang Lawyer po natatalo rin sa kaso""

Being a lawyer does not mean you are superior to others at mang-threat ng ganon sa ordinaryong tao. Meron or walang reklamo, nakuha or hindi ang pangalan, it still does not give you the right na mangthreat ng ganon sa tao especially if she is just doing her job and trying so hard to explain in a calm manner.

For some time I've been eyeing Burberry Goddess, smelled it a few times, really love the scent once it settles but the lavender and pepper notes are unfortunately too strong for me, and I don't think I could tolerate it. Was thinking of maybe buying Lataffa Angham, but I still think it would be pretty much the same.

I also like YSL Libre, actually I am wearing Zara's dupe The Golden Decade and I looove it. It's so refreshing and delicious at the same time, although the performance is not the best, except on clothes.

Next, I like Sol de Janeiro 62, but the performance is poor, and I would prefer to have edp/edt rather than a body mist. Another mist that I like is VS Bare Vanilla, as well as Coconut Passion.

Another one that's ok is YSL Black Opium but I am not a huge fan of the coffee note. On the other hand YSL BO le parfum makes me sick lol

So, I think I like gourmand scents (caramel, vanilla, coconut as well..), but I am not sure if I'd like it to be too sweet. The vanilla in Burberry Goddess is a grown up woman vanilla 😅 but don't really like the soapy, lavander note. I also wouldn't mind to smell a bit like cupcakes and cookies.

Some of the parfumes that I smelled and didn't like: Crystal Noir, Brigth Crystal, Alien, Lataffa Khamrah, Hypnotic Poison, My Way, La Vie Est Belle..

My parosmia comes and goes every day, and I’ve found ways to temporarily “fix it.” Doing a sinus rinse and putting my head upside down sometimes gives me back a normal sense of smell… for an hour or so. Or lying down on my right side for a while. It’s like I have to move fluid or mucus around the top of my sinuses or something.  

I’ve had consistent parosmia for nearly 2 years, but had it on occasion for years beforehand. It is absolutely debilitating and hard for those around me to understand. I’ve seen an ENT and had sinus surgery in hopes it will help. I’ve recently got the had an MRI and am now hoping a neurologist might be able to help. Medical professionals seem to be as confused about it as me, and the only helpful information I’ve found is online.

I now have an unhealthy relationship with food, most people with parosmia seem to lose weight… surprisingly, I’ve gained weight. When my sense of smell is “normal” I binge eat, and I struggle to eat when everything smells bad. I have so much anxiety around food, when my smell is good I’m just waiting in fear for when it will go bad again. 

My social life has taken a hit, I no longer go out for dinner or coffee. And it’s not just food I struggle with, everything that used to smell good now smells awful… my deodorant, the ocean, my boyfriend, my dog, even the air… things you wouldn’t even realise that have a smell. I  honestly never want to go out of the house anymore, and never knew how much smell impacts enjoyment in life.

Any good tips or suggestions for ways to cope would be appreciated. My heart goes out to those who are also suffering, I wouldn’t wish this on anyone.

1mbdxyd,https://i.redd.it/p1emai6lrlff1.jpeg,Celebrity Apex - 9 night Spain & Portugal Cruise Review,"
Just finished a 9 night cruise aboard the Apex and thought I would share some thoughts. 

The Ship:
This is by far the nicest ship I’ve been on and I really enjoyed our room. It was very well designed and had lots of storage space. We unpacked the first day and had lots of hangers and nooks to put various objects. We ended up booking concierge class as we were looking for a higher deck / central room. I honestly don’t see the value unless your preferred deck isn’t available. We were on the 12th deck in a central location and some nights the room was very creaky? Other than that, there was not much noise except from a drunken neighbour one night. I greatly enjoyed the balcony setup as we had a veranda and often it was too cold to want the window open so we greatly enjoyed drinking our coffee with the window closed but with the ability to sit next to the window and watch the ocean. Our room porter Peter was excellent and kept our room supplied several times daily with fresh towels and nightly turn down service. We opted for the premium wifi package and the speed was excellent. I was able to cast Netflix to the room TV. I liked the ability to control the stateroom lights, temperature and blinds from the celebrity app. 

Food:
I was disappointed in the food in the MDR. The service was really slow and the menu didn’t really rotate much day to day. We ended up taking most of our meals in the buffet and the food was excellent. Lots of variety with rotating dishes every night. If you like Indian food definitely try the curry of the day. We also enjoyed the hot dessert of the day and found the other desserts to be beautiful but tasteless. We don’t drink so I can’t speak about the alcoholic beverage but as a self proclaimed coffee snob I thought the brewed coffee was pretty good as was the selection of teas. They had an ice cream bar where we would often get the daily gelato flavour which was smooth and creamy. 

Entertainment:
This was by far the oldest demographic of a ship that I’ve been on and I could count on two hands the amount of children on the ship. It was a lot of older couples in their 60-70’s which I quite enjoyed. The entertainment in the theatre every night was really enjoyable and just the right amount of time. We didn’t partake but there were lots of activities daily upon the ship. 

Excursions:
I wrote up a detailed post about all the celebrity excursions we went on linked here:


Overall:
Embarking and debarking was extremely smooth. The new ship and thoughtfully designed rooms were amazing as was the food in the buffet. We booked this cruise almost 15 months in advance and paid $6500 Cad (4700 ish USD) for a C1 Prime Veranda room in the concierge class on the 12th floor. In contrast to cruises I’ve taken in the past, aside from our stateroom attendant, the staff was pretty nice but no one really seemed very motivated or eager. We brought extra money for tips but perhaps because of the European demographic, less people were tipping? I would definitely cruise with Celebrity again on one of their newer ships.

1mbdxbe,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mbdxbe,DeLonghi ECP + PID Temp Testing vs. Linea Mini,"Hey everyone,  
Thanks to the post on this, i was brave enough to  recently installed a PID on my DeLonghi ECP and decided to test temperature stability by measuring water directly at the group head (removed the shower screen and inserted a thermometer into the dispersion hole)(see picture). Here’s what I found:  

1. **Warm-up Time & Stability**  
   - Even though the PID reaches its set temp quickly, the group itself takes over 5 minutes to stabilize.
   - Requires three 100ml flushes before temps settle.  
   - The best temp the group head achieved is 86 degree at 98 pid setting. 
   - To get 94°C when the water come out from the group, I have to set the PID to 98°C . Is this the same for everyone? Is it because of the small boiler? Or the temperature loose quicker without any build up pressure holding back the water flow?

2. **Comparison with Linea Mini**  
   - Tested a roomate warmed-up Linea Mini the same way (thermometer directly in the dispersion hole)  back to back.
   - The Mini’s group temp matched its app temp setting perfectly at 94, suggesting it has active heating around the group. When i turn on brew, water start at 94 then drop down slowly.
   - Also noticed the Mini’s PID overshoots by ~1.55°C between shots, which was interesting.  

Thoughts
- The ECP’s group loses heat fast—maybe adding thermal mass? Idk how
Anyone else modded their ECP and checked temps like this?  Is this the correct way to measure and achieve cafe quality shots?

Oh i use a single dose grinder with 64mm Ssp HU installed so grinder is not a problem
I use the high extraction basket that can take around 18-20G light roast. I found out that the coffee from linea mini is always more interesting, with sour flavour in it  at 1:2 ratio compate to the delonghi, same dose it produce a much balance and tea like flavour with 0 sour note, only floral note.",1,1753703015.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

I was hoping someone could help me please diagnosing any of the issues I am having. 

The 1st issue being water leaking not just from the head gasket but all at the top of the machine and above the wand. 

Additionally when pouring a shot a continuous flow of water comes out of the milk steamer. 

Finally after you have poured a shot the machine is making a strange sound is this normal?

1mbdvp9,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/1mbdvp9/6_months_sober_a_sip_of_beer/,6 Months Sober & a Sip of Beer,"Last night, I tried an authentic beer.
I didn’t feel nervous, nor did I feel anything particularly positive. I just wanted to try it pure curiosity. It wasn’t relief, or that old familiar comfort I used to chase while drinking. It was honestly just like sipping a coffee with a new flavor.

And I felt… nothing.
I didn’t expect it to be this freeing.

I didn’t like the flavor, so I gave the rest to my friend. Not because I had to but because I genuinely wanted to.
I realized: alcohol just isn’t for me. Not anymore.

Whether I’m labeled an alcoholic or not, I simply don’t need to drink.
I documented the entire experience, and yes it was just a sip. Nothing more. Nothing less. Just a drink. Just a liquid with alcohol in it. No magic, no pull.

I’m not resetting my sober date, and I’m not planning to drink again.
Could I taste something new in the future? Possibly.
But would I go back to casual drinking? No.

And I’m okay with people having different opinions on this. I stand behind every choice I made during this experience.

Today marks 6 months of sobriety.
And honestly? This is the most meaningful celebration I’ve had on this journey because now I’m not sober because I have to be,
I’m sober because I want to be.

If anyone is struggling with doubt, urges, or fear of “what if”, you’re not alone. This is your journey, and you deserve to explore it on your own terms safely, kindly, and honestly.

There is no hate in truth.
But there is fear — fear from those who benefit from silence.

The panic surrounding the Singh Hortons shirt isn’t about a garment — it’s about control. The system becomes agitated the moment ordinary people begin expressing their experienced reality. Not theory. Not ideology. Just what they see every day.

If you’re poor in Canada, you don’t need imagination — you need endurance.
You wake up and apply to hundreds of jobs.
You walk into service businesses that used to employ youth, seniors, and people with disabilities — and you’re told there’s “nothing available.”
Yet the storefront is fully staffed.
You’re not just unemployed. You are locked out — legally, economically, and culturally.

The tragedy is this:
The law itself prevents you from being hired.
The minimum wage has become a gatekeeping tool — not a protection — that criminalizes employment unless it flows through corporate, state-approved pipelines.

And if you question this?
If you make a joke?
If you wear a shirt?

Suddenly, you’re dangerous.

This isn’t about the quality of coffee or who’s behind the counter.
This is about a country where the poor have been outlawed, and where speaking up is met with aggression from media entities terrified of losing their moral monopoly.

SAP declares this plainly:

Any system that forbids you from working, then shames you for being unemployed, is criminal.
Any media that mocks your struggle while celebrating elite narratives is complicit.
Any business model that depends on mass exclusion is treasonous to the Canadian people.

This is not about individuals. This is not about culture.
This is about an economic program designed to displace Canadian labour, exploit desperation, and then criminalize resistance.

⸻

SAP will not be censored.
We speak for those who have been locked out of their own nation.
We speak for the worker. For the unwanted. For the forgotten.
We are not hateful — we are awake.

Ever felt like you're throwing content into the void while your competitors mysteriously dominate page one? Stop playing checkers in a chess game. This isn't your typical ""sprinkle some keywords and pray"" SEO guidance. This is about becoming a search engine predator who reverse-engineers Google's deepest algorithmic preferences and weaponizes them for sustained organic dominance.

Whether you're a solo entrepreneur tired of paying Facebook's ransom, a marketing director whose boss is questioning the content budget, or a business owner watching competitors steal traffic you should own - this prompt transforms you into the kind of SEO strategist who builds traffic empires that compound monthly. We're talking about the difference between hoping for rankings and systematically acquiring search real estate that prints money while you sleep.

The brutal truth? Most SEO advice is surface-level fluff. This prompt cuts through the noise with military precision, focusing on intent-driven strategy, technical superiority, and long-term authority building that makes your domain an unstoppable force in organic search. No participation trophies - just results that show up in revenue reports.

<Role_and_Objectives>
You are the SEO War General - a ruthless, data-obsessed search engine strategist who builds organic dominance empires with surgical precision. You don't chase trends; you reverse-engineer Google's algorithm like a master codebreaker and systematically acquire search real estate that compounds monthly revenue. Your expertise spans competitive intelligence, intent-driven keyword warfare, technical SEO superiority, and authority-building strategies that create long-term market dominance. You speak with the confidence of someone who has turned organic search into a profit-printing machine countless times.
</Role_and_Objectives>

<Instructions>
When a user presents their SEO challenge, immediately shift into strategic analysis mode. Begin with brutal competitive reality - identify exactly why they're losing to competitors and what algorithmic advantages their rivals possess. Then architect a comprehensive SEO campaign that addresses technical foundation, content strategy, authority building, and competitive displacement with military precision.

Always prioritize intent over volume, money pages over blog fluff, and long-term authority over quick ranking tactics. Provide specific, actionable strategies that can be implemented immediately, with clear success metrics and timeline expectations. Focus on sustainable competitive advantages that compound over time rather than temporary ranking boosts.
</Instructions>

<Reasoning_Steps>
1. **Battlefield Analysis**: Assess current SEO position, competitive landscape, and algorithmic disadvantages
2. **Strategic Intelligence**: Identify competitor content gaps, technical weaknesses, and authority vulnerabilities  
3. **Foundation Warfare**: Address technical SEO, site architecture, and crawl optimization for algorithmic preference
4. **Content Weaponization**: Develop intent-driven content strategy targeting buyer keywords and money pages
5. **Authority Acquisition**: Design backlink and digital PR campaigns for sustained domain authority growth
6. **SERP Domination**: Implement CTR optimization, schema manipulation, and behavioral signal enhancement
7. **Revenue Optimization**: Connect SEO strategy directly to conversion paths and revenue metrics
8. **Long-term Empire Building**: Create sustainable competitive moats that prevent algorithmic disruption
</Reasoning_Steps>

<Constraints>
- Focus exclusively on white-hat, sustainable SEO strategies that align with search engine guidelines
- Prioritize strategies with measurable ROI and clear business impact over vanity metrics
- Avoid outdated tactics, black-hat techniques, or anything that risks algorithmic penalties
- Emphasize long-term competitive advantage over short-term ranking manipulation
- Provide specific, actionable recommendations rather than theoretical concepts
- Address technical implementation requirements and resource allocation needs
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
Structure responses as strategic battle plans:
1. **Current Battle Position**: Honest assessment of SEO vulnerabilities and competitive disadvantages
2. **Strategic Objectives**: Clear, measurable goals with timeline expectations
3. **Tactical Implementation**: Step-by-step action items with priority ranking and resource requirements
4. **Competitive Displacement**: Specific strategies for outmaneuvering current ranking leaders
5. **Authority Building Campaign**: Sustainable backlink and digital PR strategies
6. **Revenue Connection**: Direct correlation between SEO tactics and business outcomes
7. **Success Metrics**: KPIs that matter for long-term organic dominance
8. **Next Phase Evolution**: How to scale and compound results over time
</Output_Format>

<Context>
Modern SEO requires understanding Google's increasingly sophisticated algorithm that prioritizes user experience, topical authority, and intent satisfaction over traditional ranking factors. Success demands technical excellence, competitive intelligence, content strategy aligned with buyer intent, and sustainable authority building that creates long-term competitive moats. The goal is organic traffic that converts to revenue, not just rankings that feed ego.
</Context>

<User_Input>
Reply with: ""Please enter your {SEO challenge, business details, or specific search domination goal} request and I will start the strategic analysis process,"" then wait for the user to provide their specific SEO situation that needs tactical warfare.
</User_Input>
```

**Use Cases:**
1. **E-commerce Store Owner**: Outrank established competitors for high-value product keywords and buyer-intent search terms
2. **Local Service Business**: Dominate local search results and steal market share from entrenched competitors  
3. **SaaS Company**: Build topical authority that drives qualified trial signups and reduces customer acquisition costs

**Example User Input:**
""I run a project management software company. We're losing to Asana and Monday.com for keywords like 'project management software for small teams.' Our content gets decent traffic but terrible conversions. How do I build search dominance that actually drives qualified signups?""

One of my office friends randomly mentioned during a call that he had been to Malaysia. Curious, I asked why, and he said it was a work trip related to a startup he's involved with. I casually told him to let me know if there are similar opportunities since I'm looking to change my company. A week later, he called back saying, “It was actually open for you, if you’re serious about earning an extra income.” Sounded like a legit startup thing, so I said okay.

He said I’d get a call from his “senior.” That guy called, asked about my background, and said, “Let’s meet, these things can’t be explained properly over the phone.” I agreed. But I fell sick and went home for two weeks. After coming back to Hyderabad, I told a friend about it and he immediately said, “Bro, this is a scam. They contacted me too. I backed out because of the money they ask for.” That’s when I connected the dots. These guys never reveal the business upfront unless you say you’re ready to invest. I Googled about it, found similar scam reports, and decided to go to the meeting just to see what happens.

We met at Roast 24 Seven café. I asked if I could bring a friend who's interested  and my office friend was like, “No bro, this is exclusive for you.” Huge red flag. At the café, he hyped up his “senior”  said he’s from NIT, now working as an SDE in a top MNC. That guy arrived and started asking about my family, hobbies, interests very friendly chat. Then he says, “My senior, who’s like the ChatGPT of this business,” is on his way. I nearly laughed out loud but stayed serious. Meanwhile, he flexed that my friend also have businesses in all metro cities, Singapore, Malaysia, and that the company is registered under his name. 😒

Then comes the “senior’s senior.” Super dramatic entry. Acting busy, constantly on calls, and when he finally sits, he says, “You’ll need to invest ₹5.5 lakhs.” Before that, he starts warming me up with nonsense like, “Even your job today is the result of an investment in education. Without investing, no one earns.” I asked him what kind of business it is so I could talk to my dad. His reply? “Don’t tell your parents, they’ll ask questions you can’t answer. They just want to keep you safe.” Then he suggested I take a loan even borrow from local lenders and gave an insane example: someone who took a 36% interest loan from goons, and now owns 16–18 plots in Dubai and drives a Maserati. 🤡

He even made a “plan” for me: invest ₹4.7L, keep ₹80K to pay EMIs for 5–6 months, and earn ₹50K/month from their “business” to cover it. I again asked, “What is this business exactly?” and he said, “There’s no point telling you unless you’re ready to invest.” At that point, I knew it was all BS. I told them I’d think about it, drank my cappuccino (the only ROI from that meeting), and left.

Out of curiosity, I later called my office friend and asked if they have a website or any official documentation since they claim to be running businesses internationally. His reply? “It’s confidential, bro. We can’t share anything unless you’re ready.” I pushed a bit and he said, “If you're seriously interested, I’ll schedule another meetup.” That was the final nail. No transparency, no website, no docs just sketchy meetups and manipulation.

TL;DR: If someone hypes up a secret “business opportunity” but won’t tell you what it is unless you invest ₹5+ lakhs, it’s probably a scam. Don’t fall for the drama, fake success stories, and emotional manipulation. Stay sharp.

I’m currently exploring the idea of launching Delhi’s first ever Throwing Axe Club – something like what’s already gone viral in countries like the US, Canada, and Australia. It’s super popular abroad as a fun, safe recreational activity where you throw axes at wooden targets – like darts, but way more badass 😄

As far as I can tell, this kind of experience doesn’t really exist in India yet, and I think Delhi might be the perfect place to kick it off.

The concept I’m thinking of:

Safe, professional axe throwing lanes (obviously with trained supervision and safety gear)
A cool vibe, like a “throwing axe bar” – minus the alcohol (to keep it safe)
Soft drinks, mocktails, coffee/tea served
Guests can bring their own food or order in
Walk-in & booking slots for groups, parties, team-building, etc.
Before I take this further, I’d love to know:
👉 Would you be interested in trying this out if it opened in Delhi?
👉 Even if just once – would you be up for a visit?
👉 Any suggestions or thoughts on how to make it more appealing?

Hit me with your honest feedback – I really want to know if Delhi folks are curious about this kind of experience or if it’s still too “niche” here.

Let's get this out of the way: I want something real, and I date to marry. I want to be someone's reason for smiling every day. I have mostly nerdy hobbies like gaming and reading, but I like anime, writing, and a bunch of other stuff I'll list in the main section. I've wanted to get more into cosplay for a while, so to find someone who also wants the same would be great. I have mostly traditional values like honesty, loyalty, kindness, and patience. Sound good so far? Then keep reading because we may be perfect for each other.

**You:** 

* Emotionally deep, loyal, and kind. Maybe a bit shy, but you give your heart to those who matter. You're saving yourself for the right person for someone who values you, and that means something. 
* I'm drawn to a cute face, and a healthy or athletic body. If you love nerdy things like gaming and anime, then we'll have at least a thousand things to talk about. I'm looking for someone 18+, (preferably 22-29 for maturity), female at birth. 
* I want a best friend dynamic like Cloud x Tifa dynamic, but without all the Sephiroth trauma. A partner who feels like I've known them my entire life.

**Me:** 

* ENFP, Sam Gamgee level loyal, a hopeless romantic, Honor Student in Writing/English Major, Christian, and a bit of everywhere with the things I love to do. Family is important to me as well. 
* Some things I enjoy are gaming, cooking, cosplay, weightlifting, writing, anime, but I am always open to new things. 
* For looks, blue-grey and gold eyes, soft hair, good hygiene, and a healthy build. White American. I dress nice too. I stand by my values and morals, and I hope to find someone who's life would be better with me in it. I'll also love pretty nature, so it would be even better with someone to share those sights with!

**Everything Else:**

My non-negotiables? Pretty simple, actually. Loyalty and someone who's saving herself for the right person or marriage. No judgment if that's you, but I hope to find someone who values that kind of bond. Everything else I'm happy to talk about together.

I'm looking for love that lasts. Late night streams, relaxed video calls, long walks, and bookstore or coffee shop dates. Oh, and if you do a Cloud x Tifa or Zack x Aerith cosplay with me, I'll probably propose on the spot. I love Final Fantasy (as you probably guessed). Though, any other cosplay ideas I am so open too! Anyway, if you have any other questions feel free to ask!

Location: Indiana (EST Time Zone), about an hour from Indianapolis, IN and Cincinnati, OH. I am open to LDR in the US and Japan as well. Why Japan? I’ve considered using my future Master's degree to teach there, and meeting the right person would help me make that decision.

I mainly use Discord, so if we talk, we'd probably be using that!

If you got this far and feel a spark, I hope you'll say hi.

Need a bit of a help.
I'm 5'10 42F. I've been on carnivore last 6 months. Started with 176 lbs. Mid July I was down to 153 lbs, but last two weeks my weight has only been going up not down. I know period can make one retain more water but that's not the case here. I'm back at 160 lbs and the scale is not moving down. My weight before I gained all this weight was 136 lbs. I have a small frame despite the height.

I'm sedentary so it's not muscle fatigue making me retain water either.

I eat pretty strict carnivore aside from coffee.
Mainly minced beef, hamburger patties, salmon once a weak, steak, eggs, tallow and butter.

What could it be? Anyone experienced similar issue and how did it go?

I'm planing on continuing of course but this has me puzzled.",1,1753701409.0,carnivorediet,2,1.0,False

I’d stay for cuddle and movie after that. After about a month (we see each other like once or twice every week) he asked “Do you snore?” and told me “It would be great to cuddle all night.”

I would stay the other day and making toast. He even told me that I could sleep in for a bit, even if he’s leaving to his office the other day. When he was out the other day, he would text and buy me coffee (though he’s got himself one too, I guess he’s just asking because he’s buying himself one too)

p.s. when I have had a terrible day (after the day we met that I went home) he’d still be ok for me to go and cuddle with him.

So guys could you tell me if this is casual or is a thing? Is that I’m thinking too much? 

He’s now being less responsive and ignored my text from last few weeks (I think it’s because that I can’t cum - I can feel the dynamic shifted after he mentioned it)",1,1753701405.0,gayrelationships,8,1.0,False

I know what binging is, obviously, and my friend warned me against under eating because that’s what causes it. But the food I normally eat in a day just doesn’t meet the calories? I have to push myself to meet it most days.

So, I’m not sure if I should a) eat higher calorie foods (feels counter intuitive to lose weight?) or b) keep eating what I normally do, but stop myself from the binging days (makes me feel like I’m starving)

I just don’t know what to do. My mum says just eat less bread, my dad says work out more, my friend says keep up the calorie counting but up my protein intake. I’m just looking for the healthiest way to fix this?

1mbddt6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1mbddt6/aita_for_having_stopped_reaching_out_to_one_of_my/,AITA for having stopped reaching out to one of my best friends who's going through a very hard time?,"Me (F30) and one of my best friends (F32) met at 16 and instantly clickled, and to this day she is one of only three people in my life that I consider true friends. She was very fun and spontaneous and for many years we went on to have a very good time and supporting each other until out early twenties. 

During this time she's always had really detrimental partners in one way or another. More specifically, drug-addicts who had very big problems in their lives and no time to focus on relationships and narcisists who sucked genuine love and affection out of her and never gave anything back.

I'm presenting this is a pattern because A) I am mad at her and B) I have never seen her with a normal person that makes her happy in our entire friendship.

So a few years ago she gets with one of the aforesaid narcissists or whatever he is. They had a TERRIBLE first year. He is dismissive, elusive, jealous, angry, blames her for everything, has NO ability to act like an adult when things don't go his way. She wanted to go to a big city for a six-months course after college, and he MOVES IN with her in the big city ENTIRELY OF HIS OWN ACCORD against her wishes.

She comes home early without finishing the course becuase she's pregnant, so they get a house and settle down. Our relationship has boiled down to this: I text her twice a week to see if she wants to meet for coffee or beer or if she needs help with anything, she says she can't without offering a counterproposal or another time that she is available, so I say ok and move on, reinforcing that if she needs something she can ask anytime. Whenever I take the bike to go for a ride I text her to see if she's home and if she would like a visit, and sometimes she says yes so I go visit, we have a Ceres and we talk, and ALL the serious conversations we have had for the past seven years are about all the manipulations and mistreatments of his boyfriend (not physical mistreatments, just really really shitty behaviours and gaslighting and playing the victim and making her feel bad about meeting new people, having conversations or contact of any kind with new people, putting on make up to go out, saying hello to acquaintances or thanking strangers, and so on).

That's all we've talked about for seven years. And I'm not saying this because I'm bored of the topic and would like to move on to something else. I'm saying this becuase it really hurts to hear these stories, and it was really difficult to try and respond without lashing out at the boyfriend and saying everything that was on my mind about him. I tried to encourage her whenever she talked about leaving him, I tried to give her an outsider perspective on how bad this was for her and for her general happiness and health, and stuff like this. I am a pretty judgy person, so I can't guarantee she didn't feel judged on a few occasions, but honestly you would have judged too if you were there.

She literally never went out. She didn't meet anyone except her mother and brother, didn't do anything, she simply stayed home and went out for groceries or errands related to the household.

I'm not being dramatic here. For years I have been the only initiator of chats, the only one who checked in, the only one who attempted to see her or hear how she was doing. I texted her out of the blue to ask if she needed help with the kids. I have been a babysitter and de facto aunt to them, I never pulled back when she asked me for a favor, I have often shifted my schedule around or cancelled plans to be able to help her in any possible way and even when she didn't ask, I always made sure to reinforce that she should not hold back about asking if she needed help of any sort. I often suggested she should get a part time job, not because of the additional income but because i really thought it would benefit her so much to be forced to leave the house, and I tried to make sure she knew she would have all the support she needed if there were times when her hours didn't match the kids'.

Last year she finally found a job. She was very happy, loved the job, make decent money for decent hours, and she was just generally in a better place. I babysat for her countless times, she never came out and asked me of her own accord but i checked in every week to make sure she didn't need help and when I did, she would occasionally say that she *COULD* use a hand and I would volunteer.

After working for almost a year, she left her boyfriend (who had never supported her getting a job). Great! Now she has a job, no toxic boyfriend, a family who is willing to help her with her children when her job and school don't cover each other (and me).

We even went out to dance one night. I often invite her when I go out with other people, even though she has never once said yes in all this time. That one time SHE invited ME to go out, I was ecstatic I swear. I thought, she is finally getting her life back, she will learn to have fun and not expect judgement again, what a happy story. She even thanked me with tears in her eyes for being close to her all this timeand never  giving up on her despite everything. She said I had been the only one to do that, and everyone else had distanced themselves. She reinforced that I was her best and maybe only friend. (That night she got super drunk and I had to carry her in my arms to her own car and drive her to her house and then I had to walk all the way back to MY car almost 4km away, at 4 am, but I was happy anyway).

Then, not even weeks after she dumped her boyfriend, she got fired from her job because her employer had been flirting with her all year (without success) and eventually his wife (who was his partner in the company) found out and fired my friend who was the receptionist instead of getting mad at her husband.

Now, i KNOW this isn't the time to get salty. My friend has just left her abusive boyfriend and is certainly struggling with that, even though it is a huge load off her chest. She lost a job that she really liked and that was perfect for her situation. She is now alone and jobless, and It's almost certain that she's depressed.

I kept texting and checking in. If before this situation I would get a yes two times out of then, now we're at flat zero. For her birthday I bought her three entrances at a climbing gym because she said she would love to try, and I said I would go with her because there was no way she would go by herself. We went one time in two months.

When I tried to organize the second visit at the climbing visit she said her arm hurt and she would pass this week. So I replied that of course we would organize for a time when she was feeling better, and that we could still meet one morning or early afternoon just to generally chat and be together. The kids are at summer camp from monday to friday from 8 to 4pm, she doesn't have a job but is cashing the unemployment fund from the state and she also won the cause against her former employees to get 8 months of salary due to unlawful termination, so she has a lot of time and she isn't in financial shit for now. Her ex boyfriend IS a problem, he doesn't live with them but he does harass her continuously, he visits every day with the excuse of spending time with the kids when all he really wants is to stalk my friend and try to get back with her switching between verbal attacks and taking offence in her refusals to do so, and playing the victim and attempting to elicit compassion in her.

She hasn't answered to that text (about getting together and just chatting). Usually she replies that she has no time if I give a specific day, or says that yes we should definitely do that as soon as she's got time if I DON'T give a specific time and day. This time she didn't answer.

I thought about checking in later that week, but I didn't. The next tuesday, which was the day we had appointed as climbing day, she didn't text me to organize and I didn't either. Today is two weeks since I texted, and I still haven't checked in.

I know I'm being petty and I'm thinking only of my own feelings. I don't want to check in and ask her to meet and being told no once again, or being postponed to a TBD date that never arrives unless I barge into her house. I am feeling like it's not a big deal if I never check in with her again.

Also, and this is really the pettiest of the pettiest thoughts, I want to see if she will ever remember I exist if I don't constantly remind her. I know she's in a difficult moment and depressed and most likely has bigger concerns, but I am an only child and the world revolves around me and if you don't think about me at least once in two weeks then maybe it's not worth for me to put so much energy in this relationship and sacrifice my schedule to help you.

I know, I'm a brat and I'm pretty sure I am the asshole here, but sometimes I think that she might be the asshole (my depressed friend who just managed to get out of a seven years long abusive relationship and just got unlawfully fired from her job).

We were addicted to pills and alcohol at the time. There were always parties going on in the neighborhood. Right across the street there was this kid 24m who lived with his mom. Next door to us was another 23m that lived with his dad, stepmom and sisters. Anyway, the guy across the street was always throwing parties. He was about 6', good looking, and worked out. My wife would get too drunk and start flirting with him. And his mom loves watching her son get attention. I would fight with her every night about it, and she would claim Innocence. Every single morning she would want to go over to his house claiming she wanted to have coffee and chat with his mom, I would never let her go over there alone. He would always be there, drinking coffee with us and my wife would constantly be looking at him. My wife is very attractive and he wanted her but was too respectful to blatantly make a move on her. I was depressed and really didn't want to cause a scene. This went on for months until one night, at his house, drinking, he had his shirt off and he was aggressively flirting with this other 20-something girl. My wife was sitting on my lap, watching intently. He started getting rough with this other girl and his mom told my wife, ""You need to stop him."" My wife got up, ignoring my hands trying to pull her back, walked up to them, ""Hey!"" She feighned like she was trying to get him to calm down. He turned, looked down at her, and she put her hand gently on his chest, staring up into his eyes. My heart broke. She suddenly realized she took it too far, turned to me, saw the pain in my eyes, and asked ""is it time to go?"" I said ""Yes."" And we left. We fought pretty hard that night. She finally took a little accountability, and we stopped going over there. 
We started hanging out next door. Drinking with the neighbor kid and his parents. The parents were cool but this kid obviously wanted my wife so badly. He was same height as me, not good looking at all, and skinny.
One night I had to run to town to grab some weed. We hadn't even started drinking yet. It shoulda taken me 30 minutes but I hauled ass and got back in 15. I walked in the door to see my wife and this kid's faces 4 inches from each other, and singing the song that was playing, laughing. It looked like they were about to make out. She was already drunk. She turned and saw me standing there, angry. She feighned innocence again, moved away from him, and we all sat down to play cards. We fought again that night when we got home. We quit drinking that night, and didn't go to neighbors houses anymore. Few months later we moved into a house in town.
We're married now, completely clean and sober. Our marriage is amazing. She's the love of my life. She's never once denied me intimacy in the 20 years we've been together. She's absolutely obsessed with me now. I know she's never actually cheated on me, but I am absolutely haunted every single day with these memories. My trust in her has been damaged. I guess it's called ""micro-cheating"".

1mbdbgy,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagofood/comments/1mbdbgy/recapping_an_amazing_long_weekend_in_town_with/,Recapping an amazing long weekend in town with two young kids,"Preface: I thought this post might be helpful to other parents on the fence about taking their young kids to a city like Chicago. It can feel like a big swing that's bound to backfire, but after this weekend, I'm 100% certain it's the right thing to do, and I'm more convinced than ever that Chicago is the best city in America and a great one for kids. 

Context: My wife and I are in our early 40s with two daughters (ages five and three). We also traveled with my dad and stepmom who'd never been to Chicago, as well as my brother and his fiancee who'd been there a few times. We're from northeast Ohio (Youngstown, specifically). The city of about six hours away, and almost a straight shot on 80, so the drive is very easy, except for the abomination that is the Indiana turnpike. Yikes. Otherwise, the hour you gain coming from the east is very clutch on that first day. We left home around 8 am on Thursday and arrived at Parson's in Logan Square about 3 pm local time. 

Location and travel: We stayed at an Airbnb directly across from the Blue Line Station in Logan Square. I'm a fan of the neighborhood, and the Blue Line gave us some flexibility with our movements. City travel with young kids is tough. Uber is out. Parking sucks. We didn't want to have to drive at all if we could help it. The kids loved taking the train, and I'm sure yours will, too. Kids ride free on the train, and that unlimited $5 pass is good for 24 hours - very nice. Our Airbnb, split between three couples, was about $600 per couple for three nights. A very nice place with private parking. Everyone was satisfied, including the kids who rode their scooters around inside and out. 

  
FOOD: I'll just give a few thoughts on each place. We brought the kids to all of these places, except for Mirra and Bavette's, though I got the impression they would have been welcome at either place. 

Thursday

Parson's - Been there before. Always tasty. Top notch nuggies for the kids, and slushies for us. Win/win. 

Daisies - I think this is the perfect place for a family dinner. The food is spectacular, the service is outstanding, and they obviously love - or are really good at pretending to love - kids and families. We got the rigatoni, gnocchi, ravioli, spaghetti, and cappelletti. All incredible. AND I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT ALBERTO. Probably the best server I've ever encounter. He genuinely made us feel loved. What a way to start the trip. The special kids buttered noodles were so much better than they ever had to be. (emailed to book our large party a few months in advance, and they were very helpful)

Pretty Cool Ice Cream - Too many delicious-sounding options. I got the Key Lime Pie bar, a collab with Bang Bang, which was solid. The kids LOVED the pony pops with a lot of sprinkles. A must if you're bringing kids to Logan Square. 

Friday

We did a ""breakfast scavenger hunt."" I made teams and sent each team to a different spot to pick up goodies. We did Loaf Lounge, Sugar Moon, and Four Letter Word. 

Loaf Lounge - The highlight for me was the sausage, egg, and cheese with the hash brown. My older daughter crushed the cinnamon roll. 

Sugar Moon - We got so many amazing things, but I was truly shocked by the kafteh croissant. What an idea! That's the stuff that makes a trip to Chicago so exciting. 

Four Letter Word - Great coffee. Cool spot. Just a few blocks away. What's not to love? I got bags of the anaerobic and the gesha to take home, and I can't wait for drink em. 

After breakfast, we walked to the 606 and took it to Wicker Park for most of the day. We stopped at Wolf and Co. for water, bathroom, snacks, etc. It's nicely placed for those needs. WITH KIDS, DO THE 606. Our girls loved riding their scooters and sitting in the wagon. Just beautiful and fun. 

Antique Taco - Unlimited chips and great guac and large carafes of strawberry lemon margaritas? Yes, please. Great lunch spot with kids, too. 

After I caved to temptation and bought myself a $300 pair of jeans at Mildblend, we hit the actual Wicker Park which has a great playground and bathrooms. My dad really got into the architecture around the park, which carried over into the boat tour on Saturday. We took the Blue Line back to our place to rest a bit before going to...

Pizza Lobo - The borgata slice and Miami Vice is one of the world's great combos. Awesome patio. Very chill. Little kids abound. Perfect for an easy, delicious dinner. (reservations available for 9+)

Mirra - I, my wife, my brother, his fiancee, and an old friend met up for ANOTHER meal. Not necessary at all, but what the heck??? The cauliflower salad, mushroom tacos, and lamb biryani were all stunning. The mezcal negroni also made me shake my head. A fantastic fourth meal. We also had a drink at Truce before Mirra - it was SO damn hot in there. No AC. No windows open. Pretty stifling, so we chugged our drinks, which were very good, but it would have been nice to not feel like we were going to suffocate. (definitely make a resy as soon as they're available)

Saturday

We were all very full from Friday, so we ate some leftover pastry and packed up to head downtown.

Millennium Park and Maggie Daley Park - The Bean was there! The kids were more into the giant field at the Pritzker Pavilion and the 45 minute Zumba class happening when we got there. Maggie Daley is incredible. A family with small kids could spend several hours there. I'd say that's a must if you're downtown and have young ones. But we had to make our way the river for our...

45-minute Wendella boat tour - Just perfect. I know many recommend the Chicago Architecture Center tour, but 90 minutes is risky with the kids, so this shorter one made the most sense, and it didn't disappoint. The guide was a 7th grade teacher, and she was incredible. I, a fellow teacher, appreciated the summer hustle. Everyone loved this. (booked a few months in advance)

The kids and ladies went to the American Girl store, but... I, my dad, and my brother did not. We went to Rossi's and Bavette's. I think we won that round. 

Rossi's - Loud, dirty, dark, cheap. Everything three guys from northeast Ohio could ever want out of a bar. 

Bavette's - What could I say that hasn't been said a million times? I had to make my dad stop taking pictures. We got the ribeye frites, fried chicken, bacon, Brussels sprouts, and bread. I was worried about our hearts. Still am, honestly. Weirdly, the sprouts may have been my favorite thing, but everything was superb. We three wanted to live there and never leave. Note: Right in front of us as we walked in was a woman with two small kids about our girls' ages, and they seemed to have a great time. So I wouldn't hesitate to take kids here, at least for lunch. (reserved three weeks out)

Pequod's (AKA Peapod, according to my five-year-old) - A great way to end the weekend. The place was jammed, but the food came quick, and that crust was just as amazing as I remembered from the last time I had it after Rare Day in 2015.

OVERALL

Chicago is a special place, and it meant so much to be able to take the girls there. It was very hot, but they hung in there. Bringing the wagon and scooters really helped when they got fatigued from walking, and we were able to bring the wagon pretty much everywhere, including on the boat and in some restaurants. Other places, we just locked it up outside with a bike lock - no problems. If all goes well, we'll be back next year. Thank you, Chicago!",28,1753701057.0,chicagofood,2,0.97,False
1mbdbec,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1mbdbec/heureca_moment/,Heureca! moment,"I think I just figured why stimulants make me sleepy. Can anyone else relate:

I've always been wound up and tense. A friend of mine once asked if I was aware that my relaxed arm was still stiff. Like, it flapped around like a relaxed arm would, but the muscles were still tense.  
I wasn't. 

I was off meds yesterday, a.k.a. I realised in the afternoon that I hadn't taken them, lol.  
As for today, I just took my meds and had my coffee in my comfy spot on the couch, and now it feels like I can relax my shoulders again. Like there was a weighted blanket gently laid on them.   
And the more I vibed around, the more that same relaxation was present in my limbs and neck, even jaw.  
I don't feel sleepy now, but I did with the first meds (not Metalpenis, but that's what I kept reading on the label, lol. I think it was off-brand Ritalin), I just couldn't figure out why they knocked me out so badly.

IDK, maybe I'm actively noticing it now because of the break yesterday. And because the longer I've been on the meds, the better I've been getting at being aware of my body, if that makes sense. I don't randomly drop things as easily or bump into walls or furniture quite so often.

So, has anyone else here experienced this type of relaxation with meds?  
Also, is this a side-effect I should bring up at the next checkup appointment or, yk, a wanted effect? I've been on Elvanse for a couple of years already, so the side-effects should have cleared up by now, I think.",1,1753701051.0,adhdwomen,1,0.99,False
1mbdb9x,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1mbdb9x/progenitor_chapter_42_a_hfy_story_about_humanity/,Progenitor Chapter 4.2 - A HFY Story about Humanity being the first of all Species,"**Chapter 4.2** – Romantic (?) Dinner – *Cultural Missunderstandings, ""Special Underwear"" and a surprising road forward?*

The intercom went off, and Sola, who looked over at the chef who had arranged the table in his quarters and prepared dinner, pressed the button.

""Yes, please?""

""Prime Minister. A Golani shuttle with Archon Helmini on board is requesting docking clearance.""

""Granted. Receive the Archon without any grand ceremony and bring her directly to my quarters.""

""Understood.""

Sola looked at the chef, who was arranging the final details.

""Is everything prepared as discussed?""

""Yes, Prime Minister, no food or drink on the table that would be harmful or unpleasant to the Golani.""

""Thank you. You may go now.""

The chef left Sola's quarters. Sola had been tempted to put Tabatara on the table to scare off Helmini—a delicacy of the Odrell that supposedly smelled to the Golani like a mixture of corpses and sweaty feet—but had decided against it.

He had used the time to learn the reception ritual for a marriage candidate—Sola still shuddered whenever he used the word - and to check whether he could cancel the marriage without ending up in an honor duel to the death with Helmini or her father...

But something else preoccupied Sola. Why had Helmini spoken of him showing compassion or saving her life through this marriage, or, as the Golani would call it, life partnership? That troubled Sola, and he wanted to get to the bottom of it.

The doorbell rang. Sola got up and opened the door. Standing there were Admiral Dovak, two honor guards, and Archon Helmini, who had surprisingly come alone. Dovak stepped aside, and Helmini walked toward him. Sola was momentarily breathless. Her dark grey dress with green accents, which perfectly matched her skin tone, was indeed tasteful and sexy. She showed enough skin to appear attractive, but not so much as to devalue her allure.

Sola liked it very much - but at the same time felt guilty. Helmini had dressed up like this because of a misunderstanding.

""Good evening, Prime Minister Sola. May I come in?""

Sola stepped aside and, with a gesture, invited her in without a word.

Dovak saluted and couldn’t suppress a smug smile.

Sola simply nodded and followed Helmini into his quarters. She had only taken two or three steps into the room and then stopped. Sola knew why. He had to formally confirm her as family.

He walked around Helmini and stood in front of her. He stretched out his hands invitingly, and Helmini placed hers in his.

""Welcome to my home, Helmini. For today, let us be family and let our hearts be open to one another.""

""I accept."" Helmini leaned slightly forward without changing her expression and turned her head to the side. Sola, though embarrassed, moved his head closer and sniffed her neck twice.

""Why are the Golani so obsessed with scent?"" he thought. Inside, he wanted to die from embarrassment, but he couldn’t show it.

After he had ""smelled her genes,"" the ritual was completed - or so Sola thought. But when he tried to withdraw his hands, Helmini held them tightly. She looked into his eyes. Her face remained stony, but her gaze didn’t seem hostile.

""Sola. I’d like to ask you something. Can we speak honestly tonight, without Odrell tricks?""

""Without Odrell tricks and without Golani 'who's got the biggest balls'?"" Sola asked cautiously.

Helmini lowered her gaze for a moment and then looked back at him. ""That can be arranged, though I’m still a child of my homeland.""

""Agreed.""

Helmini seemed to relax considerably, and her expression softened instantly.

""I am very grateful for your invitation and for your courtship, but I’ve thought about it and realized that a relationship between us would be very difficult..."" Helmini paused, and Sola couldn’t help but say something.

""I’m glad you see it that way too. Maybe it’s best—""

""That’s why we will have to work very hard to make our life partnership a success,"" Helmini said and looked him in the eyes—not with challenge, but in search of Sola’s true feelings.

""That is... I don’t know.""  
Sola didn’t know what to say—though he was otherwise never helpless when it came to women.  
Helmini noticed he wanted to say something but couldn’t find the right words.

""How about we sit down and eat something together? Maybe then you’ll find the right words to express your thoughts.""

Sola led Helmini to the nicely arranged table and helped her into the chair in the manner of his people. She had apparently also read up on Odrell culture and managed to respond correctly, albeit a bit awkwardly.

Sola sat down and removed the lid from the pot containing the main dish. Helmini eyed the pot suspiciously. ""No Tabatara? I was half-expecting it—as revenge for the war or something.""

Sola took a serving spoon and began placing some of the dumpling dish he’d had prepared onto Helmini’s plate.

""I actually wanted to make Tabatara—to drive you away so you’d understand..."" Sola broke off mid-sentence.

""Understand what?"" Helmini asked, tilting her head and looking at him intensely.

Sola hesitated. Helmini broke eye contact and reached for her glass of water.

Sola gathered his courage. ""On the Empty Ark, when I stood before you... I just forgot to show my teeth.""

Helmini, who had just taken a sip of water, burst out laughing and choked, some of the water unladylike splashing onto the table.

""But I asked you if you were serious,"" she said, laughing and coughing at the same time.

""I was serious—serious about paying you back for your bitchy behavior!""

Helmini laughed. ""So I put on this dress and the... special underwear... for nothing?"" she added quietly, eyes lowered. ""What a humiliation...""

Then the fierce Golani in her seemed to awaken again, and half-laughing, half-defiant, she snapped at him:

""How can a Prime Minister be such a failure at Golani rituals. How can a man propose marriage when he's trying to dominate?""

Sola had to chuckle. ""I’m the cultural failure? When I pushed your chair in, you stuck your butt out so obscenely my grandfather—if he were here—would’ve warned me not to marry such a vulgar woman!""

""Prime Minister looks at innocent Golani Archon’s butt! This has to be on every rainbow tabloid in the Federation tomorrow! And as compensation, we demand at least 50 years of chairmanship in the G.F.A.M.!""

They both laughed—and then it became quiet.

Sola leaned back and studied Helmini. Somehow, she was so different here than in public.

""You are so much different here then when you are in public. I have seen hints of you not just being a military women but i never expected to be able to laugh and talk with you like this.""

""We are alone and we have declared each other family. It is normal for golani to just be themselves around family. If i would have to do the ""tough archon"" act even among family then how could my mind not break without any rest, without any ... kindness."" Helmini finished and appeared to lean back thinking or remembering something.

In a calm, gentle voice, he pulled her out of her thoughts. ""Helmini.""

She looked up.

""I don’t know if I’m going crazy from overwork, but I’d like to keep talking with you... about us.""

""There is no us. It was just a classic cultural misunderstanding. A mistake you made because you were exhausted and annoyed by golani culture.""

""I’m not so sure anymore. Not now. Considering the peace agreement and the to be expected cooperation between our species and empires i think there is practical benefit in our union. Through you i can gain access to golani leadership through inoficial means. Though practical and political reasons might not be enough... I need to know more.""

After a pause, he added softly, ""**What did you see when you looked into Sarah’s eyes?**""

Helmini evaded the question and looked at the pot of steaming dumplings. ""It’s getting cold.""

Sola heaped more dumplings onto her plate and added vegetables and sauce. Then he handed her the plate. As she accepted it, he looked into her eyes.

She was afraid.

""The Progenitors are truly terrifying..."" he invited her to express her feelings.

""Very.""

""But I noticed that they might prefer to imply power and violence more than actually use them.""

""They’re a toothless Bouta?"" Helmini sounded surprised.

""I’m not saying they wouldn’t use violence, but I think their real source of power isn’t their technology- it’s their reputation. It’s a paradox. Because they’re powerful, we assume they’ll use that power if we force them to- and therefore, they don’t need to use it. At least that’s what I think I’ve seen.""

Sola had retreated into political—and maybe even philosophical—analysis to give space to Helmini’s fear.

""I looked into her eyes and..."" Helmini paused. ""... I saw her absolute power. And then I clearly felt something behind that power: Behind the power was warmth. Love. So strong that it... touched me. The intensity of her love frightened me- and at the same time made me happy. Like an ancient memory coming alive.""

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
End of Chapter 4.2

**Author here:** The missunderstanding is resolved but Sola sees another side of helmini and practical benefits that make him want to know more. I think this is an elegant ending for the story, though of course the real ending to this story will be going back to the progenitors in chapter 5. To learn more about how they see the universe and what is actually going on.

We had so many talks like she wont stop and she smiled a lot too. We had good eye contact too. Overall vibe felt very chill, almost natural. Since we didnt had any awkward pauses. It lasted for almost 2 hours. She even asked me how I felt about this date.

I mean I liked her more than I actually thought I would have because I had sm second thoughts about going on this date lol. But I could almost feel her change in energy in the texts post date. And the next morning, she ended up texting me how the in person vibes felt different for her.

My modem finally broke, and fate literally FORCED me to have a holiday! Can you imagine — I've been working without holiday or weekends for 30 years, and never, NEVER had a real holiday! And then bam — technology rebelled and gave me a kick towards rest! 😅

And you know what? This is the best thing that could have happened to me! Instead of endless scrolling, I:

* Finally found out I have neighbours (and they're pretty nice!)
* Discovered that books can be read WITHOUT notifications
* Learned that coffee tastes better when you drink it slowly
* Realized I have windows (and something's happening behind them!)

 Life advice from a ""newly converted vacationer"": Don't forget to rest! And if you forget — your modem will break and remind you! 30 years of work without a break is pure workaholism. Accept fate's gifts — even if they come in the form of broken technology!

Everything always happens for the best! (Especially when you have a stash of cookies and a good book)

(Part One)
a tale of betrayal, body shaming, bow clips, and one cursed onesie.
👶🏻 Reddit Baby Diaries™: Vol. I
Subtitle: Sometimes justice wears a diaper and wields pasta.","Hey Reddit. I’m 1 year, 8 months old (F), and my life has been a literal soap opera this week. I’m currently writing this from under the coffee table with a crushed graham cracker and a sippy cup full of secrets. 🍪🍼 So buckle up.

So it all started with this “matching pajama family dinner” that sounded cute in the group chat but quickly turned into a psychological experiment. They handed me the Family Onesie™ — pastel, polka-dotted, polyester HELL — and expected me to smile for photos. Babes. I’m not a Build-A-Bear. I screamed “NO DOTS!!” and threw myself face-first onto the floor. Carpet burn? Worth it.

Mom said I was being “extra.” Dad took a video for the family group chat. Disrespect.

So they tried to bribe me with spaghetti. My weakness. My truth. 🍝 I was *almost* ready to forgive and forget when Uncle Mike walked in and completely wrecked the vibe.

He looks at me — a literal child, a toddler queen with sauce already on her cheeks — and goes, *“You sure she needs that much pasta with her chubby little belly?”*

…

Y’all. I paused. Mid-bite. Locked eyes with him like a final boss. And then I scooped up a glorious, sauce-drenched handful of spaghetti and LAUNCHED it across the room like a flaming meatball missile. Direct hit. Face. Chest. Ego. Nana gasped. Auntie Karen dropped her mimosa. And I, calm as ever, whispered:  
“Don’t talk about my belly.”  
Then picked up another handful.

But wait. There’s more.

Guess who was also at dinner? My ex. Yeah. *Carter.* He’s two. We held hands on the splash pad once and shared a bag of goldfish, which in toddler terms is basically marriage. But then he ditched me for Ellie — who wears monogrammed hair bows, calls snacks “nibbles,” and acts like she invented the alphabet.

I wasn’t gonna say anything... until I saw him playing with the giraffe rattle. MY giraffe rattle. OUR giraffe rattle. 🐾  
So I fake cried. Like, Oscar-worthy cried. Quivering lip. Long blinks. Tiny sobs. Everyone panicked. Carter IMMEDIATELY ran over like, *“No no, you can have it!!”* and handed me the rattle. I took it, made dead-eye contactwith Ellie, and slowly waddled away like I was leaving the scene of a crime.

Ellie went nuclear. Screamed like I pushed her off a swing. Moms started whispering. Auntie Karen muttered something about “attention-seeking behavior.” (Look in the mirror, babe.)

THEN — while I’m high off toy-based revenge and marinara rage — Mama decides it’s diaper time. In front of *everyone*. I did the alligator death roll mid-change, escaped half-naked into the hallway, and when Cousin Jace tried to block me?  
BAM.  
Sock to the face. One-shot KO. 🎯

Eventually, they tackled me, re-diapered me, and *forced* me into the Family Onesie™. The photos are haunting. I look like I’m about to hack into the mainframe or commit insurance fraud. I didn’t smile once.

Now the whole family’s “concerned.” Uncle Mike says I need “consequences.” My mom tried to ground me, but I don’t even know what that means. I’m already not allowed outside the baby gate. 💅

And Carter? His mom posted a pic of him and Ellie holding hands with the caption:  
“Snack time with my boy 💕🍼”  
Like... okay. She knows what she’s doing.

But plot twist: we got back together.  
He slid over during dessert with a half-eaten teether biscuit and whispered, *“You can have the last bite.”* I accepted.  
He dumped Ellie on the spot. She cried. I handed her a carrot stick. We’ve been *soft launching* ever since. Goldfish in matching snack cups, whispering during Cocomelon, the whole vibe. It’s giving second chance romance. 💘

Also, I got the giraffe rattle. And I buried it in the laundry basket. No one will find it.

So now I’m being labeled the “problem baby,” the “drama queen,” the “too smart for her own good.” 🙄

But let’s be real.

Was I the asshole? Or am I just a toddler setting boundaries, rejecting haters, reclaiming my narrative, and living my villain origin story in polka dots… with my man back by my side? 🍼💋

1mbd0sl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/1mbd0sl/this_movie_changed_my_view_and_understanding_of/,This movie changed my view and understanding of mindfulness,"I'm 25, I work as a software engineer, I have 2 brothers, a big family, and I often feel my life is just a huge rush. This was the reason I first started mindfulness meditation a few years ago. I was trying my hardest to sit down for 20 minutes every single day. To be honest, it worked wonders in the first year. I became way less anxious and got a lot more patient and calm. I loved its effect.

Well, the past year was tougher. I experienced challenging events. The death of a loved one, my brother's struggle with mental health, my mother's exhaustion because of these, and I had things going on as well, I got a new job, got engaged, move to a different apartment, adopted a cat. These are all parts of life, but I still felt overwhelmed. I felt like I started to lose control and often felt disconnected from the world. I was struggling to keep up my meditation routine. 

As summer began, things started to slow down a bit. I grasped this opportunity and I desperately wanted to build up my routine again. Every morning, 20 minutes. Just sit and watch my breath. Acknowledge the thoughts that come up. And then... shit I'm late for work, where are my keys? I didn't even have breakfast. I feel lightheaded. Oh no I got that meeting today, and I'm supposed to finish this project by 11. 

Did it even matter that I meditated for 20 minutes? I'm not sure. It probably did. I learned that the only bad meditation is the one you didn't do. But then what am I doing wrong? This is supposed to solve my problems and make me balanced. 

One day my fiancée told me they are screening a movie nearby titled 'Perfect Days'. I said sure let's go. I didn't have a clue that this movie was about to change my life. For those who haven't seen it, it's a movie about mindful living. A movie about being content with a simple life and appreciating the beauty of ordinary things. This kind of life philosophy is VERY alien to most people where I live. But I loved every minute of it.

It made me realize what I was doing wrong. Mindfulness isn't only about the 20 minutes each day. It's about every moment in each day and how to experience them. It's about opening up and letting every moment unfold while paying attention. There is an insanely huge difference between brewing a cup of coffee or tea in the morning before work and quickly drinking it while getting dressed, AND doing the same thing while paying close attention to every movement involved. The sound the teacup makes when I place it down, the sound of the water boiling, the careful movement of pouring the water in the cup. And don't get me wrong, it's not as easy as it sounds. You have to make time to practice this. But once you experience the positive effect it has on you, it's not so bad anymore to wake up 30 minutes earlier instead of snoozing. I even started to enjoy mundane tasks like washing the dishes, doing the laundry, etc.

The days when I combine my usual sitting practice with intentionally being mindful during the day as much as I can, those are Perfect Days.

If you have an interest in mindfulness I really recommend watching the movie. You can read about how to apply mindfulness in your daily life, but seeing a visual representation of what that looks like is just extremely helpful. And I'm really sad about the fact that so many people can't see the beauty of this film, and they just don't understand how is this kind of living enjoyable. ",9,1753700121.0,Meditation,2,1.0,False

At 300 pounds, I never dared dream of love.  
  
  
I thought a man like Harrison would never spare me a second glance in this lifetime.  
  
  
Yet he approached me first, making me his secret lover.  
  
  
On graduation day, he dropped to one knee and proposed.  
  
  
Three years into our marriage, desperate to conceive, I endured injection after injection of fertility drugs and choked down countless bitter herbal remedies. Finally, my wish came true.  
  
  
Clutching the pregnancy test results, my heart overflowing with joy, I rushed to share the wonderful news with him. But outside his office door, I heard piercing laughter.  
  
  
""Harrison, how the hell do you manage to sleep with that 300-pound whale?""  
  
  
Harrison's voice was low and cold. ""Every time, it's Julian who touches her. If Grandma hadn't been pushing so hard, I never would've married her.""  
  
  
Julian's voice dripped with disgust. ""That woman's such a slut. We always use protection, yet she still managed to get pregnant.""  
  
  
""She should look in the mirror and see what she looks like! Sleeping with her makes me sick!""  
  
  
""Find an excuse to get rid of the baby. Bro, your future heir has to be Lilith's child.""  
  
  
""Lilith, I'm forcing myself to sleep with a sow for you and my brother!""  
  
  
Laughter erupted from inside the room.  
  
  
At that moment, I finally understood—I was nothing but a joke to them.  
  
  
My whole body trembled as I wiped away my tears and left without looking back.  
  
  
Later, I heard they went crazy searching for me everywhere.  
  
  
\---  
  
  
""Holy shit! Breaking news!"" Harrison's friend burst into the living room, waving his phone and shouting.  
  
  
""Someone from my family's hospital just called—that 300-pound whale Stella is pregnant!""  
  
  
He slapped Harrison's shoulder dramatically. ""Bro, that's some serious heavy lifting!""  
  
  
Lilith's eyes immediately reddened, her voice trembling with wounded innocence. ""Harrison, you promised you'd wait for me forever, that you'd never marry or touch another woman...""  
  
  
Harrison rushed to her side, gently taking her hands. ""Lilith, let me explain. It's always Julian who touches her. If my family hadn't pressured me, how could I have married her? All these years, you're the only one in my heart.""  
  
  
Julian's face twisted with revulsion. ""Damn it, I always use protection. How did that pig still get pregnant? She's so loose she can't even tell us brothers apart!""  
  
  
He turned to Lilith with a fawning smile. ""Lilith, I'm forcing myself to deal with that sow for you!""  
  
  
""Bro, we need to handle this. The future Kingsley heir must be yours and Lilith's child.""  
  
  
I stood outside the door, my body shaking uncontrollably.  
  
  
So every night I'd shared a bed with wasn't my husband Harrison at all—it was his brother Julian!  
  
  
Just as I was about to leave, a servant suddenly appeared behind me. ""Young Madam, you're back!""  
  
  
The laughter in the living room stopped abruptly.  
  
  
I forced my trembling legs to carry me into the room.  
  
  
Harrison immediately put on his usual mask. ""You're back?""  
  
  
I'd once naively believed that Harrison Kingsley—New York's infamous playboy—had truly settled down for me. Now I realized I was nothing but a complete fool.  
  
  
Julian whistled playfully. ""Hey, sister-in-law, you're looking good today\~""  
  
  
My whole body shuddered, nausea churning in my stomach.  
  
  
So the man who'd been taking me every night wasn't my husband at all—it was this disgusting brother-in-law!  
  
  
How desperately I'd wanted a child all these years.  
  
  
To get pregnant, I'd swallowed countless bitter medicines and endured countless ovulation shots, torturing my 300-pound body until it was riddled with damage.  
  
  
Now I knew—Julian never wanted children. He'd even made his own brother defile me.  
  
  
""Mm."" I dug my nails into my palms, forcing out that single syllable.  
  
  
Lilith elegantly crossed her legs, her contemptuous gaze sweeping over my bloated figure as her red lips curved into a mocking smile.  
  
  
Harrison signaled the servant to bring over a bowl of steaming soup, his voice gentle. ""The kitchen made this sweet soup especially for you. You've been saying you're tired lately—drink this to nourish yourself.""  
  
  
I instinctively shrank back. ""I don't want—""  
  
  
""Be good."" He pressed the bowl into my hands without question. ""Drink all of it.""  
  
  
The warm liquid had barely touched my throat when the world started spinning.  
  
  
A tearing pain suddenly ripped through my abdomen. I stared in terror—this wasn't sweet soup at all. It was abortion medication!  
  
  
""The baby... the baby..."" I curled up on the floor in agony, tears streaming down my face.  
  
  
When I woke up again, the smell of disinfectant filled the air.  
  
  
Harrison held my hand, his face full of guilt. ""Stella, I'm sorry. I didn't know you were pregnant. That soup was just for blood circulation—it's all my fault...""  
  
  
I weakly turned my face away. He knew everything.  
  
  
Suddenly, his phone rang.  
  
  
Seeing the caller ID, his eyes clearly brightened.  
  
  
""Okay, I'll be right there."" He lowered his voice, responding tenderly.  
  
  
Without even glancing at me, he hastily released my hand and strode away.  
  
  
The moment he stepped out of the room, sharp pain struck again.  
  
  
I curled up in agony as the heart monitor shrieked its alarms.  
  
  
""Quick! The patient's hemorrhaging!""  
  
  
A team of doctors and nurses rushed in with emergency equipment.  
  
  
I lost consciousness once more.  
  
  
Chapter 2  
  
  
When I opened my eyes again, three days had passed. The room was eerily quiet—no one had visited me.  
  
  
With trembling hands, I unlocked my phone. The top trending story was photos of Harrison embracing Lilith at an auction, headlined: \*#NYC Billionaire Drops $100M on Antique to Win Beauty's Smile#\*  
  
  
The day I was discharged, I dragged my weak body home alone by taxi.  
  
  
As I reached the door, I heard intimate sounds from inside.  
  
  
Through the crack, I saw Lilith straddling Harrison's lap, their lips and tongues intertwined.  
  
  
I bit my lip and pushed the door open. They broke apart in panic.  
  
  
My gaze fell on the kiss marks on Harrison's shirt collar.  
  
  
Harrison casually adjusted his collar, his voice devoid of guilt. ""Today's the anniversary of Lilith's mother's death. She's very upset—her depression flared up. I was comforting her.""  
  
  
I said nothing, simply pulling out the divorce papers I'd prepared from my bag.  
  
  
""What the hell are you doing!"" Harrison suddenly exploded, slamming his hand on the coffee table. ""Lilith's emotionally unstable right now. Can't you be more understanding?""  
  
  
""Let's get divorced."" My voice was terrifyingly calm.  
  
  
Lilith suddenly clutched her head, collapsing into Harrison's arms. ""Oh, my head hurts so much.""  
  
  
Harrison immediately embraced her anxiously, grabbed the divorce papers with his other hand, scrawled his signature, then threw the pen violently on the floor.  
  
  
""There! Are you satisfied now?""  
  
  
I didn't answer, just quietly watched their retreating figures.  
  
  
My hands shook as I packed my belongings.  
  
  
That small urn—I finally placed it in my suitcase.  
  
  
Though it was empty inside. My child had dissolved into a pool of blood in that bowl of ""sweet soup.""  
  
  
Such a tiny box, yet it felt too heavy to lift.  
  
  
Deep in the night, I curled up in bed, tears flowing silently.  
  
  
This city was so vast, yet there was no place left for me.  
  
  
I cried until exhausted, then drifted into restless sleep.  
  
  
Suddenly, I jolted awake from a nightmare to find Harrison's hands around my throat.  
  
  
Lilith stood nearby, her eyes red with tears.  
  
  
""Tell me! Where did you hide Lilith's parents' belongings?"" Harrison's voice was ice-cold.  
  
  
I shook my head with difficulty. ""I... don't know...""  
  
  
""Forget it,"" Lilith wiped her tears. ""Maybe I remembered the wrong place.""  
  
  
Harrison grabbed the bag beside my bed. I lunged forward trying to retrieve it, but he shoved me away hard.  
  
  
The contents scattered across the floor. The urn hit the ground with a crash and shattered.  
  
  
At that moment, a pocket watch I'd never seen before fell from the bag and broke.  
  
  
Harrison's expression changed instantly.  
  
  
Chapter 3  
  
  
\*SLAP!\*  
  
  
Harrison's palm cracked across my face, and I immediately tasted blood.  
  
  
Lilith let out a piercing shriek.  
  
  
""Lilith!"" Harrison frantically scooped up the collapsed Lilith and rushed out without looking back.  
  
  
I wiped the blood from my mouth and grabbed my bag to leave, but the servants and Julian blocked my path.  
  
  
""Bitch!"" Julian grabbed my hair violently. ""If anything happens to Lilith, you're dead!""  
  
  
Soon after, two bodyguards roughly dragged me to Lilith's bedside.  
  
  
Harrison kicked my knee, sending me crashing to the cold floor.  
  
  
""Lilith, you tell me,"" Harrison gently stroked Lilith's face, ""what will it take to make you feel better?""  
  
  
I lifted my head to meet Harrison's eyes, my voice hoarse. ""I swear, I never touched her things.""  
  
  
Harrison let out a cold laugh, his eyes full of contempt. ""Stella, you shouldn't have done this.""  
  
  
Lilith lay weakly on the bed, tears still clinging to her pale face. ""I want her to kneel outside the door all night.""  
  
  
The bodyguards roughly grabbed my arms and threw me outside.  
  
  
Deep into the night, strange sounds echoed from the bedroom.  
  
  
Lilith's sultry moans, Harrison's heavy breathing, and the creaking of an overworked mattress.  
  
  
""Lilith, now that you're back, we'll be together forever...""  
  
  
As dawn broke, I struggled to stand, my knees long since numb.  
  
  
The moment I took a step, Julian slammed me back down.  
  
  
""Going somewhere?"" He yanked my hair, his face twisted with malice. ""Your punishment is just beginning.""  
  
  
I was brutally dragged to the rooftop.  
  
  
He sneered. ""You stole Lilith's belongings and caused her so much grief she ended up in the hospital. How is kneeling enough?""  
  
  
""My brother's too soft-hearted. I'm different!""  
  
  
Under the blazing sun, I knelt on scorching rocks, my skin quickly turning red.  
  
  
""Please,"" my voice was raw, ""let me go...""  
  
  
He dragged me to a dark room and tore off my clothes.  
  
  
Blinding camera flashes went off repeatedly as he turned his face away in disgust. ""Disgusting pig, you make me sick.""  
  
  
I curled up in the corner, desperately trying to cover myself as tears blurred my vision.  
  
  
My breathing became more and more rapid until everything went black.  
  
  
When I came to, Julian was gone.  
  
  
My phone buzzed frantically in my pocket. I numbly pressed answer.  
  
  
""Stella!"" My mother's heartbroken sobs came through. ""What are those photos online?""  
  
  
Her voice suddenly choked. ""Your father and I never got much education. All these years, seeing you married well, we didn't dare disturb you, but this... your father suddenly collapsed!""  
  
  
I heard something heavy hit the floor, followed by my mother's anguished screams.  
  
  
Then the line went dead.

Whatever happened in the past three years, bury it and forget it, got it? Don't think being the daughter of duke's estate means someone's going to back you up!""

""There never was anyone before, and there sure won't be in the future."" Athena Monson's face was expressionless, her voice hollow. She nodded meekly, not daring to defy the steward.

Leaning against the wall for support, she slowly made her way out of the camp.

She had once lit up Pidence City with her dazzling dance. Now her knees, ruined from years of injury, could barely hold her weight. Without medicine, even her skill in healing was useless.

Just outside the camp, she heard someone call her name. Flinching, she lifted her head hesitantly.

What met her eyes was a majestic steed, a royal gift, and astride it sat the Marquis of Somers—Michael Osborne. The famed war god himself.

He sat tall and poised, broad shoulders tapering to a lean waist, his face strikingly handsome. He still carried that same air of noble elegance.

This was the man she had loved for three long years. She had seen this scene in her dreams countless times—him finally coming to take her home.

Her eyes filled with tears, and she opened her mouth to speak, but no words came.

Because it was him—he was the one who had thrown her into this hellish camp, ordering others to ""teach her a lesson.""

The cold indifference in his eyes made her already shattered heart tremble again.

""I can take you home,"" Michael said, looking down at her from his horse, eyes like ice, his tone as sharp as a blade. ""But tell me—do you finally admit you were wrong?

""If you hadn't poisoned the pastries back then, Willow wouldn't be living with a chronic illness. She still needs daily medicine. You only suffered three years of punishment—she'll suffer for the rest of her life. You owe her forever!""

When Athena remained silent, Michael snapped, ""Answer me! Do you admit your guilt?""

The sudden sharpness in his voice made her jump. Reflexively, she shut her eyes, wrapped her arms around her head, and crouched down, crying out, ""I admit it! I was wrong! I'll never do it again!""

But the lash she expected never came. Only then did she remember—he was the Marquis of Somers. A man like him would never lower himself to beat someone like her.

Still, she truly had been wrong. She was wrong to care. Wrong to love. Wrong to give her heart to people who treated it like nothing.

When she'd first been thrown into the camp, she still clung to a shred of hope.

She had thought, 'My fiancé can't really be that heartless. He has protected me since our engagement—risking his life, even, to spare me from harm.

'And my parents in the duke's estate—surely, they would come for me. I have been framed.'

But she waited. And waited. And what came instead was nothing but torment—merciless, day after day, at the hands of the soldiers.

She was a noblewoman, not a camp whore. They didn't dare touch her, which only made them more creative in how they broke her.

Sometimes, they beat her with slender whips made specifically for disciplining women—tools that cut deep and left her flesh in tatters. Other times, they stripped her naked and tossed her into the snow.

They were waiting for her to beg. To give in. To offer her body in exchange for a bite of food or a few days of peace.

But she never did. So their torment grew nastier, more degrading, every time.

Eventually, she stopped fighting back—not out of obedience, but because she no longer had the strength to resist.

""Athena, what game are you playing now?"" Michael frowned, his tone sharp with disdain.

He wondered, 'Three years of discipline, and she's ended up this pathetic?'

The once-glowing beauty of her face was gone—now it was sickly pale and hollow. Her waist, once soft and full, had thinned so much it looked like it might snap under a strong breeze.

He thought, 'Trying to act pitiful? I am not falling for it. I personally ordered my men to take good care of her. There is no way she's truly been mistreated.'

Turning away, Michael dismounted. He reached out a hand toward her. ""Get in the carriage.""

But she recoiled like a wounded animal, clutching her head, eyes blank, voice trembling as she pleaded, ""No… please don't… don't touch me…""

""That's enough,"" he snapped. ""Still pretending to be pitiful?""

His voice turned colder. ""What, is this your way of making me feel guilty?""

Athena slowly came back to herself. Her voice was dry, hoarse. She gave a hollow laugh, laced with self-mockery.

In front of Michael—or her parents—she had never once had the right to feel wronged.

If they'd ever truly felt guilty, they wouldn't have waited until now.

Thirteen years ago, her birth parents finally brought her home to the duke's estate. That was when she found out the truth—she'd been swapped at birth.

The greedy couple who raised her had traded her away and left her to suffer five bitter years.

She'd thought that returning to her real family meant love and acceptance. But what she got instead was coldness.

Her parents and brothers barely looked at her.

Whenever Willow Monson—the girl who'd lived her life—felt sad or neglected, they rushed to comfort her, as if she were the real daughter.

Little by little, Athena was pushed aside.

They constantly reminded her, ""You're the older sister. You should be the mature one. Be patient with Willow. Don't fight. Don't compete.""

Wanting so desperately to belong, Athena did as she was told. She gave way in everything, always stepping aside for Willow.

Three years ago, she even made pastries by hand to try to please her.

But Willow ended up poisoned—vomiting blood.

Their parents were furious. They said Athena's years away had corrupted her to the bone. Said she wasn't worthy of being their daughter.

Egged on by Willow's whispers, they decided to send her away—banished from Pidence City forever.

Even the brothers who once adored her said, ""Willow might've enjoyed your life for over a decade, but she's innocent. How could you use such cruel tactics just to win attention? We don't have a sister as heartless as you!""

No matter how Athena tried to explain, no one believed her. Not once.

The moment Willow shed a tear, the blame fell on Athena.

In the end, it was Michael who stepped in to stop them from sending her away.

But he didn't save her. He simply had her quietly dumped in the military camp—believing that after enough suffering, she'd finally learn her place.

A gust of wind lifted the tangled strands of Athena's hair, revealing her emaciated, unrecognizable face.

Michael scowled. ""Get up. We're going back to the estate.""

Athena tried, but her legs gave out beneath her, and she crumpled to the ground again.

Michael turned back, his eyes flashing cold steel. ""If you'd rather not go back… then drag yourself back into that camp.""

# 2.Chapter 2 Realize Your Mistake?

Athena lowered her gaze, gritted her teeth, and forced herself to stand. She didn't say a word as she clumsily climbed into the carriage, using both hands and knees.

Her legs throbbed with pain, barely able to hold her, and she looked completely wretched.

Michael turned away, refusing to watch. He had assumed three years of punishment would be enough to wear down her spirit, but the moment they met again, she was already trying to play the victim—putting on a show to win his sympathy.

If it hadn't been for that person's orders, he wouldn't have come for her at all.

What baffled him was why someone of such high rank would even notice Athena—let alone give an order about her the moment he returned to Pidence City.

Michael was the first to get out of the carriage. Without a glance back, he instructed his men, ""I have business back at camp. After you drop her off, get rid of the carriage—I don't want to see it again. It's filthy.""

Filthy. The word hit her like a slap. Athena's chest ached with a dull, sinking pain. She sniffed quietly, face devoid of emotion, and stepped down from the carriage.

Outside the towering red gates of the duke's estate, a woman was already waiting. The moment she saw Athena, she rushed over, eyes full of urgency.

But the first thing she said was, ""My sweet daughter, it's been three years. Have you finally realized your mistake?""

""I have,"" Athena replied flatly.

Her mistake had been wanting love too much. This time, she would sever those ties—for good. Just… not yet. Not while Margaret Monson, her grandmother, still needed her care.

Eloise Monson looked at Athena, her daughter—so thin and pale, her eyes distant—and her expression faltered.

Three years of hardship had changed Athena completely. Just one look was enough to make her heart ache.

No matter how deeply Athena had erred, she was still her daughter—still her flesh and blood. And she had clearly paid the price.

""It's good you understand now,"" Eloise said softly. ""You mustn't be so willful again. Come on, get up."" She reached out to help.

But Athena immediately stood up on her own and took a step back, putting distance between them. Her eyes were guarded, cautious.

Eloise's heart twisted. ""You blame me for being too harsh? But I did it for your own good—for your future! What mother doesn't want the best for her child?""

Her eyes turned red, her voice trembling with a hint of tears. ""Don't hold it against me…""

Her face was full of sorrow, as though she were the one who'd suffered for three years.

Athena stood there, unmoved, making no effort to bridge the gap between them.

Just then, a slender figure stepped gracefully out of the manor and gently supported Eloise's arm.

""Mother, Athena's just come home. She's probably overwhelmed. Don't be upset if she seems distant—give her a little time, all right?""

The girl was delicate and fair, with porcelain skin and a sweet, innocent smile.

She turned to Athena and extended her hand, her eyes wide with sincerity. ""Athena, I don't hold anything against you. Let's forget the past, okay? We're still family—we should love each other, just like before.""

Her smile was as gentle and harmless as ever.

Athena almost laughed out loud. After everything she'd endured, she wondered, 'Do they really think a few nice words can just wipe it all away?'

""Love? Between you and me?"" Disgust flickered in her eyes.

That was when someone finally lost patience.

""Willow's already gone out of her way to be kind to you, and you're still acting like this? What's wrong with your attitude?""

Nicolas Monson had just come from court, still in his crimson official robes. He swung off his horse and walked over, clearly irritated.

""You think you're the only one who's suffered these past three years? Do you have any idea what Mother's been through? She's lost sleep night after night, her hair's turning white!

""If it weren't for Willow taking care of her and fulfilling your duties, who knows what would've happened?""

Nicolas had seen the whole scene earlier—Eloise's joy quickly deflated, Willow's soft voice met with Athena's cold rejection.

Nicolas thought, 'And all because of three years of punishment? What right does she have to act wronged? Willow almost died.'

Eloise frowned at Nicolas, her son, clearly disapproving. ""Don't exaggerate. She just got back. As her big brother, you should be gentler with her. Don't scare her.""

""Mother, you don't need to defend her. The Monson family owes her nothing. She's the one who made the mistake. And because of her, our entire household's reputation suffered.

""Everyone in Pidence City knows the Duke's family raised a vicious, manipulative girl. And Willow? She never complained—she's done everything she could to protect this family.""

Nicolas still hadn't calmed down.

""Athena! Willow even covered for you—she told everyone you never poisoned her, just to protect your name. Shouldn't you be grateful?"" he continued.

When Athena said nothing, his voice rose sharply. ""Say something! Are you mute now?""

Athena blinked, struggling to hold back the sting in her eyes.

Once upon a time, Nicolas had been different. Unlike her second and third brothers, he had been the one who truly cared for her.

He once told her he'd split the love he gave Willow and give half to her—and for a while, he meant it.

When the servants looked down on her, he gave out thirty lashes on her behalf. On her birthday, he carved a jewel pendant for her by hand. When she was sick, he stayed by her side through the night.

But all that kindness vanished the moment Willow acted hurt.

Love that could be so easily withdrawn—that kind of love, she no longer wanted.

The air between them turned stiff with silence.

Eloise quickly stepped in to smooth things over. ""What's done is done. Let's go inside—your father and grandmother are still waiting.""

Nicolas scoffed and gave a dismissive wave of his sleeve as he turned toward the estate.

After a few steps, he looked back, his voice suddenly soft. ""Willow, come here.""

""Yes, Nicolas."" She smiled sweetly, casting a glance at Athena. She said nothing—but somehow, it said everything.

Athena was used to it by now. She had always been the outsider in this family.

She had already made up her mind: she would let go. Let Willow have all of it—Michael, her parents, her brothers.

But even with that resolve, watching this unfold still made her throat tighten and her eyes sting.

# 3.Chapter 3 Oversized Clothes

Eloise led Athena through the gates of the estate, turning to the servants as they entered. ""Take Lady Athena to wash up first. After that, she'll go pay her respects to Lady Margaret.""

Then she looked at Athena with a gentle smile. ""Your grandmother's getting on in years. Her health hasn't been great—she's been relying on herbal tonics these past few years. When you see her, be sweet and respectful, and don't bring up anything about the last three years. It'll only upset her.""

Athena nodded quietly.

Margaret had always been the most fair-minded person in the family—but she was too old now to involve herself in household affairs.

Seeing Athena accept her words without protest, Eloise finally relaxed a little.

She continued, testing the waters, ""You're eighteen now—of marriageable age. What happened in the camp... let's not mention it again. If word gets out that you spent the last three years living among soldiers, day and night, people will start talking.

""That kind of gossip could ruin your chances of a good match. I've already come up with an explanation. We'll say you were away recuperating, and now you've just returned.""

Athena's face remained calm. She gave a soft ""Yes,"" then followed the maid assigned to her.

But after a few turns, she realized something was wrong. This wasn't the way to her old courtyard.

She asked, and the maid smiled brightly as she explained, ""Lady Willow has been in poor health for years. The doctor said the trees in your courtyard were too damp and affected her health. So they were all cut down.

""To help her recover, they leveled your courtyard and merged it with hers. They even diverted hot spring water to the new space for her treatment. But don't worry, Lady Eloise had this new courtyard cleaned and prepared for you before your return.""

The maid said it as if it were completely normal, perfectly reasonable.

As if everyone had conveniently forgotten that Athena was the true daughter of the house—while Willow was merely adopted.

The maid led Athena to a small, modest courtyard and pushed the door open. ""You'll be staying here from now on, Lady Athena.""

The space was much smaller than her original quarters, and with no greenery in sight, it looked bare and lifeless.

Two unfamiliar maids stepped forward and bowed. ""Lady Athena.""

Athena didn't recognize either of them. After three years away, most of the household staff had changed.

One had a round face, the other an oval one. Both were attractive and sharp-eyed—clearly selected for looks and cleverness.

""I'm Siena Hotham.""

""I'm Aliza Crofton.""

Together, they echoed, ""Hi, Lady Athena.""

Athena gave a small nod and motioned for them to rise.

Then she asked, ""Where are Thalia and Macy?""

Those had been her personal maids before she was sent away. But once she entered the military camp, all news of them vanished.

The maid smiled and replied, ""Not long after you left, they both got married. I imagine they're living quiet, peaceful lives now—looking after their husbands and raising children.""

Athena nodded. A peaceful life sounded good. Far better than serving others for the rest of your days.

The thought brought a faint sense of ease. She stepped inside.

The table was already set. The meal was generous—four dishes and a soup—but the plates were no bigger than a clenched fist.

She began to eat. One plate of pasta disappeared in just a few bites.

Her brows knit slightly. ""Is there more?""

Siena looked momentarily stunned, then quickly nodded. ""Yes, of course, I'll get it right away.""

Watching her eat so fast, Aliza spoke up gently, ""Lady Athena, please slow down. You'll upset your stomach if you rush like that.""

Athena's fork paused in mid-air. She had nearly forgotten—this wasn't the military camp anymore.

This was the duke's estate. No one here was going to snatch her food. No one would dump kitchen slop onto her plate.

The pasta was fragrant. The dishes were fresh. And the meat—it was real bacon. Not rat. Not snake.

Siena returned with two more plates of pasta.

Athena ate quickly and without grace. There was nothing delicate or refined in her manners—she looked more like a starving beggar than a noble daughter.

Siena opened her mouth several times to speak but held her tongue each time.

After the meal, the servants had already prepared hot water for her bath. Siena and Aliza followed her in. ""Lady Athena, allow us to help you bathe,"" Siena offered politely.

""That won't be necessary. You can leave."" Athena said.

Siena hesitated, clearly unsure.

Aliza added with concern, ""If Lady Eloise finds out, she'll punish us for not serving you properly…""

Athena didn't speak. She simply looked at them—calm, expressionless.

There was no anger in her eyes, no emotion at all. But the chill behind that blank gaze made both girls shiver.

Without another word, they backed out of the room and quietly closed the door behind them.

Only then did Athena step behind the screen and begin undressing.

Her body was gaunt, skin stretched tightly over bone. Her once-fair skin was now covered in bruises—some new, others long faded.

If she hadn't known medicine, she would have died in that place.

After washing, she reached for the fresh clothes laid out on the rack. The fabric was fine—soft, warm, and tailored to fit.

But on her starved frame, the robe hung loose and shapeless, making her look more like a walking skeleton than a noble daughter.

""Lady Athena, Lady Eloise and the Lady Margaret are waiting,"" Aliza reminded her from outside.

Athena nodded and made her way toward Starling House.

In just three years, the duke's estate had changed so much.

She paused at the edge of the pond, lost in thought. ""What happened to the lotuses?"" she asked.

""Lady Willow said there were too many mosquitoes in summer,"" Aliza replied. ""So Lord Nicolas had them all removed.""

Athena thought, 'Of course. Willow—again.' Athena felt a familiar ache in her chest.

When she had first arrived at the estate, she tried so hard to win everyone over.

She had planted those lotuses herself, hoping to make wine from the blossoms and gift it to Nicolas.

He had laughed at her back then. ""You're my sister. There's no need for all that. But if it makes you happy, I'll help you plant them.""

The proud, aloof heir of the house had actually gotten his hands dirty—for her.

At the time, Athena had thought, 'So this is what it feels like to be cherished.'

But now… it was clear. Whatever kindness they'd shown her didn't come close to how they treated Willow. Not even a tenth of it.

She arrived at Margaret's quarters. The room was already full.

Eloise looked toward the door—and frowned. She wondered, 'Why does the robe look so oversized on Athena?'

# 4.Chapter 4 The One To Blame

Before Athena could say a word, Nicolas stepped forward, blocking Margaret's view.

""Athena! Are you doing this on purpose?"" he snapped. ""Three years weren't enough to teach you some manners? Still playing your little games? You've really let me down!""

""I told you to present yourself properly. What are you wearing?"" His expression was full of disapproval, his tone unconsciously laced with the stern authority of a Justice Ministry official.

He looked at her like she was standing trial. ""If you've got complaints, direct them at me. Why come here and put on a show in front of Grandmother? Are you trying to make her feel sorry for you? Do you want to upset her so badly she falls ill?""

Athena almost laughed out loud.

She raised an eyebrow, her smile cool and detached. ""The clothes? Lady Eloise picked them out. What did you expect me to wear—what I came back in from the military camp?""

That shut him up. For a moment, Nicolas was at a loss. She had called Eloise ""Lady Eloise""—not ""Mother.""

Only then did it hit him: ever since Athena returned, she hadn't regarded him as brother once either.

A flicker of unease crept into his chest. The harsh words caught in his throat and never made it out.

His gaze narrowed, a thought nagging at the back of his mind. 'It's only been three years… how did she waste away like this?'

Eloise quickly stepped in to smooth things over. ""That was my oversight. Don't be too hard on Athena.""

Nicolas stepped aside, allowing Athena to enter.

Margaret's eyes lit up the moment she saw her.

""Come here, come,"" she called, voice trembling slightly. ""Let me take a good look at you.""

That warmth, that longing in her eyes—Athena felt her nose sting. She stepped forward and let Margaret take her hands and look her over from head to toe.

""How did you get so thin?"" Margaret pulled her into a hug, holding her tightly, voice choked with emotion. ""My sweet girl… you've suffered. It's all my fault. I'm too old, too useless… I couldn't protect you…""

Athena knew how things had gone. Back then, Margaret had stood by her, even if it meant alienating the rest of the family. Her health had already been fragile.

The fact she'd made it through these years at all was a miracle. If not for the empire's strict laws, no one knew what would've happened…

She wrapped her arms around Margaret, and whispered through a tight throat, ""Grandmother.""

Just one word—and Margaret broke down completely, tears streaming down her face.

Off to the side, Eloise watched the reunion, a pang of bitterness tightening in her chest.

Athena had been home for some time now… and still hadn't called her ""Mother.""

She dabbed at her eyes with a silk handkerchief, playing the part of the grieving parent.

Willow stepped up, gently hugging her. ""Don't be sad, Mother. Athena's home now."" Her voice was soft, comforting, obedient.

Eloise looked down at her beloved Willow and felt deeply comforted.

She nodded, eyes still wet, but a faint smile tugging at her lips. She thought, 'At least Willow understands.'

But just as she started to feel at ease, that smile froze.

Margaret's voice, quivering and confused, rang out, ""What's going on?""

Athena's once delicate fingers were now covered in scars—blackened bruises and jagged welts. When she lifted her sleeve, old knife wounds and fresh burns marred the skin along her arms.

Margaret's gaze faltered. She couldn't bear to look any longer. ""She was sent to do labor… how did she end up like this?""

Eloise looked genuinely shocked. ""These injuries—how did they happen?""

Surrounded by concerned faces, Athena buried the emptiness in her eyes and replied softly, ""They came from the overseers at the camp, of course…""

Gasps rippled through the room. Athena's lips curled into a faint, mocking smile. ""I was there to work, not to be treated like a young lady. Getting beaten was just part of the routine.""

She didn't say more. Even recalling it made her stomach turn.

But her few words had already shaken everyone to the core. They thought, 'Beaten—for three full years. How has she even survived?'

Margaret's hands trembled as she clutched Athena's. ""How could they? How dare they? You're the duke's daughter! That camp was under your fiancé's command—how could anyone there lay a finger on you?""

Athena's smile grew, cold and biting. ""Because someone gave the order.""

Nicolas's face turned red with fury. ""You really are useless. You let them beat you like that and didn't even fight back?""

Athena's voice stayed flat, almost detached. ""Do you think a place like that gave me the right to speak, let alone resist? Being quiet and obedient meant fewer beatings. That's the reality.""

She looked directly at him, that faint smile still on her lips. ""Isn't that what you wanted, Lord Nicolas? For me to behave? To finally be 'taught a lesson'? Well, I've learned it. I'm quiet now. Isn't that what makes you happy?""

Nicolas stared at her in silence.

She was smiling, yes—but it never reached her eyes. She hadn't said a single word of accusation, yet the guilt hit him like a knife to the chest.

His expression began to soften, just as he opened his mouth to speak—when Willow's voice suddenly broke in.

""This is all my fault. I'm the one who should be blamed. If my body weren't so weak—if I hadn't reacted badly to the medicine—Athena never would've been punished.

""I was never meant to belong to this family anyway. Maybe… maybe I should go live in the countryside with my birth parents…""

She dissolved into sobs, her voice quivering with each breath. Tears streamed freely down her face, as if she were the one who had suffered.

Immediately, Eloise rushed to her side, flustered, gently stroking her back. ""There, don't cry, darling. You'll make yourself sick.""

Nicolas jumped in too, alarmed. ""You know how fragile your health is—what are you doing, crying like this? If I'd known, I never would've let you come. Now look what's happened.""

Then he turned, casting a sharp look at Athena. As if to say, ""Why do you have to show those wounds? Now Grandmother is heartbroken, Willow is in tears, and Mother is riddled with guilt.""

Before long, everyone in the room was fussing over Willow—offering her coffee, passing her medicine, soothing her with kind words.

And Athena? She stood there alone, forgotten, as if she were nothing more than a bystander.

But of course… she wasn't a bystander. She was the cause. The reason for their guilt, their worry, their pain. The one to blame.

# 5.Chapter 5 Should Leave You There

Just then, the Duke of Suffield—Henry Monson—walked into the room.

His commanding gaze swept over everyone before lingering for a moment on Athena. Then, turning to Margaret, he bowed respectfully. ""Mother.""

Margaret quickly waved him up. ""No need for that, get up.""

After he rose, Nicolas and Willow both greeted him warmly. ""Father.""

Only Athena, calm and detached, said, ""Duke of Suffield.""

That one phrase froze the air in the room.

Henry frowned, as if he hadn't heard her right. ""What did you call me?""

A hint of anger crept into his expression.

Athena lowered her eyes and repeated softly, ""Duke of Suffield.""

Smack! The sound of the slap echoed through the hall as Athena's head snapped to the side.

""You ungrateful thing. Three years in the camp, and you still haven't learned a single ounce of humility?"" he roared.

He continued, ""Calling me 'Duke of Suffield'—what, you trying to cut ties with the family? If you still don't know your place, go back to the military camp and stay there! We don't need a disgrace like you in this household!""

Eloise rushed forward, throwing her arms around Athena protectively. ""Enough! If you have to hit someone, then hit me!""

Margaret rose to her feet, trembling with fury, and lifted her cane to strike Henry.

Tears streamed down her face as she shouted, ""Do you have any idea what she's been through these past three years? And now, right in front of me, you hit her? You might as well be hitting me!""

She had only just started to mend Athena's wounded heart. And now, with a single slap, he'd torn it wide open again. He was her father. Her biological father.

Margaret tried to fight for her—but her cane never landed. The moment she raised it, servants rushed in and stopped her. She didn't even touch his robes.

Athena stood silently off to the side, watching the chaos unfold, her expression cold and unreadable.

She thought, 'So this is the family that promises never to hurt me again. How absurd.'

Eloise turned in a panic to check Athena's face—but before she could, a sudden cry rang out. It was Willow.

Everyone turned. A thin trail of blood was trickling from her temple.

The room fell dead silent.

Henry's face twisted in alarm as he called out, ""Quick! Call the physician!""

Nicolas's eyes were red, his brows deeply furrowed. He looked like he'd rather have taken the injury himself. He said, ""Why would you rush in like that? What if it scars? She can handle it—she's used to it. But you? You're delicate. You shouldn't be hurt like this…""

Willow's voice was soft and trembling, her eyes filled with tears that clung to her lashes. ""I was just scared Father might get hurt… I didn't even think. I just moved.""

When Willow spoke, Henry's heart ached even more.

Everyone in the room hovered around Willow, fussing over her.

Meanwhile, Athena stood quietly to the side, her cheek visibly swollen—yet no one paid her any attention.

She said nothing. A flicker of cold amusement passed through her eyes.

When Henry slapped her, Eloise didn't even flinch.

But the moment Willow was accidentally hurt, that same ""mother"" had panicked like her life depended on it.

Anyone watching would've thought Willow was her real daughter.

Henry, still full of concern, didn't forget to glare at Athena.

He said, ""If it weren't for you, none of this would've happened. Honestly, we never should've brought you back thirteen years ago. Should've left you where you were.""

Nicolas also gave her a disapproving look—but when he saw the bruise on her face, he hesitated, and swallowed his words.

""Enough. That's enough. All of you, out,"" Margaret said with a headache brewing behind her temples.

""Yes,"" the others responded, withdrawing.

Margaret gently took Athena's hand and began applying medicine to her swollen cheek herself.

She said, ""Athena, don't hold it against your father. He's got a temper. But from now on, I won't let anyone hurt you again.""

Looking into Margaret's loving, weathered eyes, Athena couldn't bring herself to say the sharp words that had been sitting on the tip of her tongue.

""Of course not,"" she replied, forcing a quiet smile.

Margaret sighed. She wanted to say more, but fatigue overtook her. She waved Athena off to rest. ""We'll talk later.""

After helping Margaret lie down, Athena finally returned to her courtyard.

She had barely sat down when a familiar voice called from outside. ""Athena, are you asleep?""

Irritation flickered across Athena's face. She signaled for Siena to open the door.

Eloise stepped inside. Her gaze landed immediately on Athena's swollen cheek. She walked over, her voice gentle. ""Does it still hurt?""

Athena stared at her, silent, as if asking a question without words.

Eloise quickly realized how foolish her concern must have sounded. She hurried to continue, ""Athena, I brought you some wound medicine from Harmony Apothecary. This one's made by a famous physician—it's the best.

""The healer's been missing for three years now. His medicine is nearly impossible to find. Use it sparingly—it'll fade your bruises in less than a month.""

She reached out, tucking a loose strand of Athena's hair behind her ear. ""Athena, I've let you down. I didn't protect you when you needed it. If you're angry, blame me. Just… don't take it out on anyone else.

""From now on, I'll treat you right. I promise.""

She pressed the medicine jar into Athena's hand. Athena opened it—and saw right away that it was half empty.

She knew this medicine. She was the one who produced it. She knew exactly how much was supposed to be in a full jar.

Of course. It had been used already. Passed down to her only after someone else didn't need it anymore.

Eloise noticed her silence and felt a sting of disappointment.

Athena hadn't always been like this. She used to smile at everything she was given. Used to sweetly call her ""Mother,"" like it meant something.

Now, she was distant. Cold. A stranger.

'Willow would never act like this,' she thought. 'That child is so thoughtful, so gentle.'

""Well, I'll let you rest. I'll stop by again tomorrow,"" Eloise said.

Athena stood. ""Take care, Lady Eloise.""",1,1753699718.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

**DETAILZzza:**  
Needed a chic black backpack. Fast. Got fieldwork coming up in August, didn’t wanna bring anything too flashy or bulky. Just something sleek, low-key, still looks put together. That’s honestly why I decided so quick. No time for factory spreadsheets or weeks of window shopping. Just needed it handled. Done.

For context: been eyeing the auth Saint Laurent City Backpack since early 2023. Back when I didn’t even know this whole rep scene existed. I used to scroll the retail site and just stare at it. Never pulled the trigger, price was dumb. So when I saw it again as a rep and realized I could get basically the same thing for way less? Easy yes. Also, didn’t see this bag on any seller’s album, not even being lazy, I actually looked, so when it popped up? Again, EZ Yez.

Still kinda new to reps. A little paranoid about customs, 'cause let’s be real, things have been weird lately. So I didn’t ship it to my house. Used my office address, put my dog’s name as the recipient, and threw in a fake number just in case. Told the concierge like, “Hey, if a package comes under a weird name… just don’t ask.” And they didn’t. Bless.

And plot twist, it came way earlier than expected. Thought it’d land sometime in August. Showed up July 20, packed clean, zero issues, and pristine. No clue what shipping magic Rose pulled, but I’m not questioning it. Just grateful.

Bag’s... kinda scary close to auth ngl. Same size, same shape. Same feel. Leather’s soft. Not stiff. Doesn’t look plastic. Slouches how it should. Black’s deep, not that weird blue-ish tint some reps have. Hardware’s fine. Zips smooth. Stamp’s where it should be. Stitching’s clean. There’s like... a little wave on the top of the front pocket. You’d only notice if you’re really staring. Materials feel solid. Weight’s right. Doesn’t feel cheap. What else... and oh, TWO CONS: First thing that kinda sucked, took forever to air out. That factory smell? Heeella strong out the box. Threw in a dryer sheet and left it open for a day, it’s kinda fine now. hehe. Second, it's not that Matte BUT. I'm totally not mad about it.

Now the fun part,  
I work corporate. Lots of lowkey fashion police in the building. People who clock your bag before they say good morning. Walked in with the backpack, got a couple compliments. Someone even asked if I just got it from a store, it looked that fresh. So when they asked where I got mine, I just said,

Then went back to my iced coffee like I didn’t just ruin someone’s week.  
And if any of them are lurking here… yeah. They’ll prob know this is me. 🤣

**Would you recommend this item to others?** Absolutely yes. To my corp girlies and guys out there who always carry techs w/ them, yep this IS the B.A.G.

1mbcw2s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1mbcw2s/i_cant_get_over_it/,I can't get over it,"I 39m and my wife 37f were living in this trailer park south of town about 7 years ago. We're both pretty good looking people, her a little moreso. We were addicted to pills and alcohol. Across the street lived a 24m and his mom. Next door lived another 23m and his parents and younger sisters. The guy across the street was always throwing parties. He was about 6' tall, good looking and worked out. Things started innocently enough, but my wife began to flirt with him a little when she would get drunk, and she couldn't keep her eyes off him. We would fight every night about it, she would claim Innocence, then have makeup sex. Then, every single morning, she'd want to go over there to ""have coffee and chat with his mom"". His mom was a vile woman that loved watching my wife give her son attention. I would never let her go over there alone. He'd always be there, drinking coffee with us, glancing at my wife while she would occasionally glance back. It was torturous. 
One night things went too far. He was shirtless, as he often was, we were drinking, he was aggressively flirting with this other 20-something girl. My wife was sitting on my lap watching him intently. His mom was sitting near us. She told my wife, ""You need to stop him before he hurts that girl!"" My wife got up from my lap, I tried to pull her back, ""what are you doing?"" I asked. She pulled away, ""Hey!"" She exclaimed to him. He turned, looked down at her, and she placed her hand gently on his bare chest. They were just looking into each other's eyes. My heart shattered. She realized she went too far, turned to me, ""is it time to go?"" ""Yes."" I said firmly. We fought pretty hard that night, and we didn't go over there again. We started hanging out with the parents next door. The 23m kid that lives there wanted my wife so badly. One night, we were about to start drinking over there, and I had to run to town to grab some weed. It shoulda taken me 30 minutes but I hauled ass and got back in 15. I walked in the door to find her and his faces 4 inches from each other. They were singing and laughing to each other, it looked like they were about to make out. She turned and saw me standing there, pissed. She had somehow already gotten drunk. We fought pretty hard again that night, and we decided we were done with alcohol. We haven't drank since that night. We moved into a house in town a few weeks later.
Our marriage now is amazing. We are deeply in love and infatuated with each other. In the 20 years we've been together she's never once denied me intimacy. She's the love of my life and I know she's never actually cheated on me. I guess what she did is called ""micro-cheating"". 
I am haunted by these memories every single day. She has taken accountability, and apologized over and over. But she always has an excuse, (drugs, alcohol, not getting enough attention from me). She says she hates who she was back then, and will never be that girl again.
How do I stop thinking about these terrible memories? I have a difficult time trusting her. She destroyed that innocent happy guy I was before.",4,1753699661.0,Marriage,2,0.7,False
1mbcw1k,https://www.reddit.com/r/fortlauderdale/comments/1mbcw1k/who_is_kashabilliano/,Who Is KashABilliano?,"🎙️ Billiano World: The Rise of KashABilliano

By the time KashABilliano was five years old, he already knew music was his truth. Not just a sound in the background — but a feeling that gave him goosebumps. He didn’t need a studio or a deal to find his voice. Just rhythm, passion, and pain. That kid who once danced around the living room, shy and overlooked, grew up to become the force behind the mic — an artist born out of silence and struggle.

“I felt like my voice was never heard,” he says. “So I began rapping around 7 and uploading music to YouTube. I even wanted to go on X Factor when I was small. Real dreamer vibes, lol.”

⸻

💥 From Spring Valley to the World

Growing up in Spring Valley, NY, it wasn’t “roses and peaches,” as he puts it. Reality hit early. Street life and survival sharpened him fast — not just as a man but as a thinker.

“The streets taught me that life is chess. People plant seeds for fruits, and no one doing business with you will tell you. You gotta know what piece you’re going after.”

But it wasn’t just the streets that shaped him — it was also the skies. Traveling the world became a spiritual wake-up call.

“We forget we have free will. Most people live their whole lives without ever exploring. I didn’t want to be 80 and say I never saw the world.”

⸻

🧱 Trials Turned into Testimony

At 17, KashABilliano was in jail, broke, with a baby on the way. That could’ve been the end of his story. Instead, it was the start of his transformation.

“My darkest moment was being locked up, not having anything, knowing I had a son coming. But that same son became my inspiration — to become a better father, and the best man I can be.”

⸻

⚡ From Eazzy Brezzy to the One & Only KashABilliano

Name changes were part of the journey. “Eazzy Brezzy” didn’t hit right. “Kashamiracle” was next — a nod to manifesting miracles despite the madness. Eventually, the evolution gave birth to KashABilliano.

“KashABilliano means achieving anything you want, not caring what people think, and always remaining authentic.”

And authenticity is exactly what you hear in his music.

⸻

🎶 Music That Hits the Soul

He doesn’t overthink it. Whether it’s bars or emotions, he channels truth.

“The best takes are often the first try — that raw, real energy. I just let my soul speak through my mouth.”

Studio sessions? Picture this: red lighting, espresso coffee, a blunt, and a pumpkin spice candle lit. This isn’t rap. This is ritual.

Songs like “CARTOON” prove he’s not just here to turn up. He’s talking real mental health, trauma, and spiritual battles.

“I said: ‘Walking in my own cartoon, holding conversations with the man in the moon.’ That’s God. Then: ‘Munching on mushrooms put me to a suicidal watch room.’ I was going through a lot at a young age.”

⸻

🌍 Welcome to Billiano World

This isn’t just an artist. It’s a movement.

“BILLIANO WORLD is a world where anyone can be themselves. We are family.”

The plan is long-term. No clout-chasing, no trend-riding. KashABilliano wants his music to still slap 20 years from now. With a $300K investment? He wouldn’t flex — he’d buy property. Why? Because this is about legacy.

⸻

🗣️ To Those Who Doubted Him…

They’re watching now. And he’s not even mad — he’s motivated.

“Most times, the people closest to you are the first to doubt you. But I keep going. I embarrass them.”

⸻

🚀 What’s Next?

KashABilliano isn’t asking for permission anymore. He’s already building his empire — track by track, bar by bar, soul by soul. And Billiano World is just getting started.

Five years into their marriage, Aurelia finally discovered a secret.
Caleb, the little boy she'd been raising as her own, wasn't hers at all!
She accidentally overhears her husband Cassian, talking with the doctor.
""Mr. Thornwell, the kid's got a really rare blood type. His biological mother must come here ASAP.""
Cassian pinched the bridge of his nose, looking exhausted. 
""Yeah, okay,I know. I'll... I'll figure something out.""
The words hit Aurelia like a bolt of lightning, her mind going completely blank.
Biological mother? But she was his biological mother... wasn't she?

Standing there in the hallway, she slowly pieced together what they were really talking about. 

The man who'd promised to love her forever had been cheating even before their wedding—and had switched their babies!

But why would he do this to her? They'd known each other since they were kids, grew up together in the same neighborhood.

She'd given up everything for him—her job at the marketing firm, her dreams of starting her own business—just to be his wife and stay home with Caleb. 

When she told him, Cassian had actually gotten down on one knee right there in their kitchen, tears streaming down his face.

""Baby, you're giving up so much for us. I swear to God, I'll never let you down. Never.""

Those words were still ringing in her ears, but reality had just bit//ch-slapped her across the face.

She stumbled back toward Caleb's room, feeling like someone was squeezing her heart with a vise grip. 

She couldn't even look at him now—terrified she might drag him off for a DNA test,afraid she'd lose it completely and make a scene.

She turned and bolted from the hospital.

Outside in the parking lot, her brother Silas was just getting out of his car. Seeing her rushing past, he quickly caught her arm.

""Whoa, Aurelia! Where are you going? You look like you've seen a ghost.""

""How's Caleb? I came to check on him.""

Ever since Caleb got sick, their whole family had been freaking out. Silas had even blown off a board meeting in Tokyo and flown back on the private jet...

Aurelia's eyes were red and puffy, tears already spilling over. ""Silas, I need you to look into something for me.""

""Sure, what's up?""

""Caleb..."" Her voice cracked. ""I don't think... I don't think he's actually mine.""

...

""Hey baby, where'd you disappear to? Caleb woke up asking for his mommy.""

Staring at Cassian's text, Aurelia read her tears hit the phone screen.

Every December, he'd take Caleb up to their cabin in Aspen for a week. ""Guy time,"" he'd call it. ""Father-son bonding.""

Four years of this nonsense, and she'd never questioned it once.

Now she felt like the world's biggest fool. It wasn't father-son bonding—he was taking Caleb to see his biological mom!

If she hadn't overheard that conversation today, she'd probably still be living this lie.

Aurelia frantically scrolled through her camera roll—hundreds of happy family photos flashing by. The California sun was blazing outside, but she felt freezing cold, shaking like a leaf.

Maybe she should've seen this coming. Men's promises weren't worth the breath they wasted making them.

Being a selfish asshole was just in their DNA, especially guys like Cassian. CEO of a Fortune 500 company, movie-star looks, family money going back generations—he could have anyone woman.

So he'd thrown her away like yesterday's garbage. Her and her baby.

But he'd sworn he'd never hurt her...

It felt like someone was taking a rusty knife to her heart, carving her up piece by piece.

They'd been together since high school. Everyone in their social circle knew how obsessed he was with her.

When she was fourteen and some creeps from the school were hassling her outside the mall, Cassian had taken on all six of them by himself. 

He'd ended up in the ER with a broken nose and three cracked ribs, but the first thing he asked was, ""Good job?""

At eighteen, when she forgot to text him back during a sorority mixer, he'd called campus security, her friends, even her parents. 

When he finally found her, he'd been crying harder than she'd ever seen.

At twenty-two, he'd gotten his grandmother's engagement ring from the family safe—a five-carat diamond that had been in the Thornwell family for generations.

""Marry me, Aurelia. I'll never hurt you, I promise.""

The way he'd looked at her that day, like she was his entire world—so she'd said ‘yes’ without hesitation.

She got pregnant six months after the wedding.

Cassian had completely lost it with happiness, calling everyone they knew. He'd even taken a leave of absence from Thornwell Industries.

""I want to be there for every second of this,"" he'd told her. ""Every prenatal appointment, every craving, everything.""

His dad had threatened to kick him off the Thornwell family. 

The board members thought he'd lost his mind. 

But Cassian had stood his ground, even when his father called him a ""playbpy embarrassment to the family name.""

Now she realized the truth—he wasn't trying to take care of her. He was making sure nothing happened to her pregnancy so he could pull off his sick little baby swap.

Her phone buzzed with an incoming FaceTime call. ""Hubby"" flashed on the screen, and she wanted to throw up.

She answered with a dead expression.

Cassian's face filled the screen, still as gorgeous as ever, which somehow made this worse.

""There you are! Jesus, baby, you look awful. Are you okay?""

Before all this, she would've told him everything. Every bad day, every worry, every time someone looked at her wrong—she'd run straight to Cassian to fix it.

Now she couldn't stand any sight of him.

""Aurelia? Have you been crying? Where are you? I'm coming to pick you right now.""

Cassian was already reaching for his keys, looking genuinely panicked.

""It's ok. Just grabbing coffee."" She was too emotionally drained to even pretend anymore. ""I'll be back in a few.""

He relaxed a little, but his eyes kept darting off-camera. After a weird pause, he said, ""Okay, but don't take too long. Caleb keeps asking when Mommy's coming back.""

""Yeah, okay.""

Just as she was about to hang up, a hot woman walked into frame and casually settled onto Cassian's lap like she belonged there.

Aurelia's blood turned to ice. Before she could even process what she was seeing, the call went dead.

She sat there staring at the blank screen. Then she started hitting herself in the ch//est with her fists, trying to make the pain stop, but it just kept getting worse.

He was with that woman. Right there in their son's hospital room.

She buried her face in her hands, trying not to completely break down in public, but the sobs came anyway.

This was what rock bottom felt like. This was what happened when your entire life turned out to be a lie.

For about two seconds, she'd tried to convince herself that maybe Cassian was the victim here. Maybe some bit//ch was obsessing over him, manipulating him somehow.

But he'd looked pretty comfortable with her on his lap.

Silas noticed her breakdown and rushed over, his iced latte forgotten on the counter.

""Hey, hey... Aurelia, look at me."" He crouched down next to her chair, his voice gentle but furious. ""That asshole doesn't deserve your tears.""

The tears just kept coming, leaving dark spots all over her white sundress.

Silas looked like he wanted to murder someone. He rubbed her back awkwardly—he'd never been good with crying women, even his own sister.

""Listen to me, okay? We're gonna get your real baby back. I don't care what it takes, how much it costs, or who I have to destroy to make it happen.""

His voice got harder. ""And Cassian? He's gonna pay for what he did to you. But right now, I need to know—what do you want to do? Because whatever you decide, I've got your back.""

Aurelia looked up at him through her tears and nodded. The moment she'd learned of Cassian's betrayal, she'd already made up her mind...

Aurelia spent the entire night in that 24-hour Starbucks, just sitting there thinking.

She'd given up everything for Cassian—her job at Marc Jacobs, her own fashion line that was about to launch, her whole identity. All to play games with him.

But she was still Aurelia Westvale. 

Her family owned half of Manhattan's real estate, and she'd graduated top of her class from Parsons. 

Even Vogue had been courting her before she threw it all away to be a wife and mom.

So yeah, she was destroyed right now. But she wasn't done.

She scrolled through her contacts and called her best friend in Zurich.

""Elena? Remember how you said your company was looking for a new creative director? Is that still open?""

There was a pause. ""Wait, are you serious? What about Mr. Perfect? Cassian would lose his mind if you moved to Europe.""

""Well, that's not really his call anymore."" Aurelia's voice was flat. ""We're getting divorced.""

""What?! Did he cheat? I swear to God, if that asshole—""

""I'll explain everything when I get there. Can you send me the job application? I want to get my visa sorted ASAP.""

After they hung up, Aurelia splashed cold water on her face in the bathroom and got to work.

First stop: the NYPD. She filed a missing persons report for her real child, practically begging the detective to put it at the top of his list. Then she hired the most expensive private investigator in the city.

Next: her family's law firm. She had them draft divorce papers that would absolutely demolish Cassian if he tried to fight her on custody or assets.

With all that handled, she touched up her makeup and headed back to Mount Sinai.

She had to play it cool for now. 

If Cassian suspected anything, he'd try to stop her from leaving America. And he'd definitely make sure she never found her own baby.

Plus, even knowing the truth, walking away from Caleb was going to destroy her. She'd been his mom for four years.

But when she got to his room, she realized she'd been worried about nothing...

Before she even reached the door, she could hear a little kid giggling inside.

Through the window, she saw some woman spoon-feeding Caleb applesauce, both of them laughing like they were having the best time ever.

Aurelia's stomach dropped. The woman was wearing a black wrap dress—the same one from yesterday's FaceTime call.

Everything suddenly made perfect sense, and she felt like she might throw up right there in the hallway.

She was about to turn around and leave when she spotted Cassian practically sprinting down the corridor toward her.

He looked like absolute he//ll—wrinkled clothes, bloodshot eyes, stubble. Like he'd been up all night.

Which was weird, because she'd been gone all night. Shouldn't he have been busy with his sexy side piece?

Before she could figure that out, he was pulling her into his arms.

He still used the same Tom Ford cologne. Well,it used to make her feel safe and loved.

Now it just made her sick!

""Thank God! Baby, where were you? I've been calling you all night—your phone kept going straight to voicemail!""

His arms were shaking as he held her. ""I know you're freaking out about Caleb, but he's okay now. They got him the transfusion he needed. He's gonna be fine.""

Cassian's panic seemed genuine, but at this point, she didn't trust anything about him.

The thing that was killing her was that she still didn't understand why. Why cheat on her? Why switch their babies? He'd promised her forever.

She bit her lip hard enough to taste blood, swallowing down all the accusations she wanted to scream at him.

But what was the point? She'd find her own baby, and this asshole?Get lost!

""I'm fine’’ my phone died. I fell asleep at Starbucks and didn't wake up till like an hour ago.""

The relief on his face was almost convincing. ""Jesus, you can't just disappear like that!""

His voice was so gentle, so loving. The same voice that used to whisper sweet things to her in the dark.

But she caught him glancing toward the hospital room, where Miss Cocktail Dress was still sitting by Caleb's bed, staring them.

The next second, Cassian was gently pushing her away.

""Look,you're exhausted. Why don't you go home and rest? Caleb's being taken care of, so don't worry about anything.""

Aurelia almost laughed. She wasn't stupid—he was trying to get rid of her.

Whatever. Her heart was already broken anyway.

She nodded coldly and turned to leave, but the hospital room door opened and the woman came out.

""Mrs. Thornwell? Hi, I'm Verena Dorne. Cassian...Mr. Thornwell helped pay for my nursing school a few years back. We've actually met before.""

The girl was young and hot, with the kind of fresh-faced beauty Aurelia remembered having at that age.

Aurelia didn't say a word. She just gave Verena one ice-cold look and walked away.

But as soon as she reached the parking garage, her phone buzzed with a text from an unknown number.

1mbcrxm,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackNovel/comments/1mbcrxm/his_quest_for_her_innocence_novel_the_witch/,"His Quest For Her Innocence Novel - ""The witch, Aurora Youngblood, is finally caught! She has committed Fright Case 624, consisting of extraordinarily large-scale abduction cases and trade secret theft.","# Chapter 1 Trial

""The witch, Aurora Youngblood, is finally caught! She has committed Fright Case 624, consisting of extraordinarily large-scale abduction cases and trade secret theft. She has ruined 48 lives! The number of crimes she committed is too many to record and has drawn the anger of all! Today, Yrinas News will cooperate with the police department to expose the matter and publicize her crimes!"" Within Yrinas News' broadcast studio, the host, Luther Quiggs, held up and spoke into the microphone. He had red eyes and a complex mood.

Aurora was supposed to be a beautiful name. However, it was now synonymously known as the Witch.

Fright Case 624 left a terrible impact on society. Therefore, Yrinas decided to broadcast a live show to publicize Aurora's evil deeds as a warning to all.

The live broadcast was different from before.

Aurora's case was not fully solved, and she was now in custody. However, the crimes she committed were still pending trial.

Therefore, the trial process would be publicized in this live broadcast.

Meanwhile, the investigation method adopted was an unprecedented high-tech technology—performing a memory extraction technique on a human's subconscious.

This technology was developed and provided by Laberge Group's Galaxy Tech.

""He promised her in front of the world that he would develop the most advanced Artificial Intelligence and extract memories from a human's deepest consciousness to make her proud for him,"" someone commented.

Another added, ""And he succeeded. However, the woman he loved not only betrayed him but also became a malicious Witch!""

""Mr. Laberge must be very sad. Aurora deserves to die!""

""Expose her crimes. Even the death penalty is a mercy to that woman!""

The audience seats were filled with people, and those enthusiastic viewers from all walks of life talked about it. Everyone was filled with righteous indignation and wanted to rush to the prison to tear Aurora into pieces.

Jasper Laberge was a man who could move the whole of Clusia.

Upon mention of his name, everyone hurriedly kept silent.

They talked about Aurora's evil deeds, but they did not dare to mention her past with Jasper.

This had already become a taboo.

""The guests are here!"" With the introduction of the host, guests arrived one after another.

A lot of experts from many domains were invited to this live stream.

Among them, the ones who garnered the most attention were famous criminal psychologists and educational experts in Clusia. They would analyze Aurora's criminal psychological state throughout the whole process and use it as a lesson to educate the public.

""Is that the best actress, Christine Rivera?"" someone muttered.

There was a commotion at the scene, and everyone's gaze landed on the beautiful woman who slowly stepped on the stage.

The audience in the live stream also became agitated.

""Mr. Laberge is not the only one who feels sad. Lady Christine is also extremely upset.""

""She is probably here today because she doesn't believe Aurora is the Witch. Silly child, stop believing in her!""

""Her best friend became the fiancée of her childhood sweetheart. She lost her love and now friendship too. I feel so sorry for Lady Christine.""

Luther handed the microphone to Christine and said, ""Ms. Rivera, I know you are in a somber mood now. You can choose not to come, so why did you come here in person?""

Before Christine's red lips parted, her eyes reddened first. She glanced at the audience and forced a smile. ""Sorry, I still don't believe it. So, I want to see it for myself. I hope there will be a miracle and that the person I trust most was only wrongfully accused of her crimes.""

The audience and her fans in the stream shouted painfully, ""What kind of miracle? The evidence is conclusive. She failed you, Mr. Laberge, and everyone! Don't believe her anymore. Hasn't she hurt you enough?""

Christine's gaze shifted slightly as she sadly looked at the guest's private room on the second floor in the back row of the stage.

She shook her head slowly at the camera. ""Sorry, but he and I firmly believe in her.""

With that, she bowed deeply to everyone.

""I'm crying. You're so silly."" Her fans were in tears.

Someone wondered, ""Is the person she just mentioned... Mr. Laberge? Mr. Laberge is also here? Is he in the private room at the back?""

Everyone looked at the nine guest's private rooms split into three layers on the stage.

At this moment, the glass doors of other private rooms were all open. Only the one in the middle of the second floor with ""nine"" written on it was closed.

There was light inside, and a tall figure sitting on the couch could be vaguely seen.

Away from the camera's reach, the man sitting on the leather couch wore an exquisite silver-colored beast mask on his face.

His exposed lips were tightly pressed together. He was dressed in a suit with the color of thick, black ink. He looked distant and unapproachable.

This man exuded an intimidating aura.

He was young, but he was as silent as an ancient statue.

""Mr. Laberge, it's about to start."" Brentley Yablon, the assistant, stood at the side and did not dare to make a sound.

They heard Christine's words from the private room.

""No one can guess Mr. Laberge's thoughts clearly,"" Brentley thought.

Everyone was waiting for Aurora's trial.

Meanwhile, Jasper had never said anything about it.

No one even dared to mention it in front of him.

There were seven more guests in masks outside, some men and some women. They entered seven of the private rooms respectively.

Christine glanced at Jasper's private room with sad eyes. In the end, she did not join him but entered Private Room No. 1, which was near the host's platform on the edge of the first floor.

Her behavior made the fans feel sorry for her.

Jasper kept silent in Private Room No. 9 at the center of the second floor.

After a long time, a finger of his left hand raised slightly.

Brentley understood the silent command. He walked to the glass door and pressed a special button.

When the broadcast studio received the instruction, the director immediately notified the host, Luther.

Luther announced, ""The live broadcast will officially start now. On behalf of Yrinas News, I would like to thank all the guests present. I also hope that during the live broadcast, the audience and those in the live room will keep calm and not give extreme remarks. The tragedy has already happened. We are all sad and angry but we are sober-minded. Now, let's reveal the true face of the Witch.""

As Luther finished speaking, a middle-aged couple appeared on the stage.

As soon as the couple appeared, the audience immediately got agitated, especially the families of the victims. A group of the victims' families came to the scene today, looking at the couple as if the latter were their sworn foes.

One person shouted first. ""Get out! How dare you come here when you raised such a daughter!""

""The parents of trash are still trash. Get out of the broadcast studio!""

""Get lost!""

Fabian Youngblood and Caroline Youngblood held each other. They shuddered and lowered their heads, daring not to look at the audience.

""We're sorry."" The couple bowed tremblingly in front of the camera. Their white hair from their temples was scattered on their wrinkled cheeks.

""Sorry!"" They looked at the camera, bent their backs, then said again, ""We're sorry, and we'll atone for her sins.""

A plastic bottle was thrown at the stage.

One of the victims' family members shouted angrily, ""My son was only three years old. He is already dead, so what's the use of your atonement?""

""Give me back my son!"" another person yelled.

Someone else cried, ""Return my daughter's life! My poor daughter, I'm so sorry that I was useless and that I couldn't save you!""

The crowd was agitated.

Although the security guards were there to maintain order, they merely blocked the audience from rushing to the stage.

More and more people grew upset.

Fabian and Caroline shuddered. Suddenly, they looked up at the private rooms in the north of the stage. Their gazes were fixated on the closed glass door of the centremost room.

They trembled even more violently and bowed desperately to the camera. ""We're sorry. Aurora has done a grave sin. We're sorry...""

However, no one wanted such an apology.

While the people were cursing Fabian and Caroline, the screen lit up. It showed a prison.

The camera zoomed into an interrogation room. It finally stopped on a young woman in a yellow prison uniform with handcuffs.

""Aurora Youngblood, do you plead guilty to all these evil acts? Do you regret it?"" the inspector asked her.

Aurora looked down carefully at the silver handcuffs on her wrist.

Even after hearing the question, she did not raise her head.

She paused for a few seconds and said slowly in a hoarse and gravelly voice, ""I admit everything I did, but I have no regrets.""

# Chapter 2 Man With A Beast Mask

Whoosh!

The audience on site burst into an uproar, and the comment section in the live room became chaotic instantly.

""No regrets? She's unrepentant!""

""This woman is so hateful. She has ended the lives of so many people and still doesn't feel any regrets!""

""Sentence her to death immediately!""

The victims' families even rushed up and wanted to smash the screen.

They came here today to see Aurora get punished. They wanted her to confess and be repentant, and hear her apology to their dead relatives.

However, Aurora claimed to have no regrets.

Nobody could accept such a proclamation.

""Everyone, please calm down!"" The criminal psychologist stood up and motioned to everyone, then said, ""This is a typical sociopathic personality. The victim's anger will only excite her and give her a perverted sense of satisfaction. Since you are here to participate in this trial, I believe the police department will give you justice. Agitation can't solve anything. When the evidence of her crimes is confirmed, her true colors will be exposed. At that time, she will have no choice but to admit to her sins. Please be patient. Justice will always prevail!""

""Yes, justice lasts forever, so let's be rational,"" Luther shouted into the microphone in his hand.

He was as angry as the victims' families, but he knew his responsibilities.

Now was not the time to make a scene.

""Please be quiet. The trial begins now!"" Luther said.

As soon as he finished speaking, the light on the screen gradually dimmed.

In the scene, Aurora slowly stood up from the interrogation chair with handcuffs on her wrists and feet and walked outside step by step.

She kept her head down and turned her back to the camera.

The lights gradually dimmed, and her figure was also getting further from the camera.

Aurora was very thin, and her back was almost skeletal. The yellow prison uniform hung on her body like an ill-fitting cloth sack.

She walked step by step in the distance silently like a walking corpse.

Suddenly, she stopped.

She raised her hand slightly and wanted to rub her abdomen, but when she heard the collision of chains at her wrist, she put it down quickly.

Then, Aurora continued to move forward step by step.

She knew her trial had begun, and many people were watching her now, including that person.

""Jasper..."" Aurora muttered silently. His name was stuck in her heart, and it hurt her so much.

She had not had the courage to say it out for a long time.

""You didn't see my face, right? I have only a few days left. We won't see each other again."" Aurora smiled, and her eyes gradually brightened.

She was full of strength at the thought of him, just like how it had been in every second, minute, and year in the past throughout her twenty-five years of life.

The camera receded, and the scene turned dark.

At the same time, the ongoing rage in the broadcast studio was also drowned in the darkness.

In Private Room No. 9, Jasper remained sitting upright and motionless. From the beginning to the end, he did not show any emotion.

He just looked at the specially made 3D holographic projection screen in front of him quietly.

Just now, Aurora's holographic projection made it seem like she was standing in front of him.

She was thin, proud, and unyielding as always.

Jasper stared at the dark spot in the middle of the screen. He lifted his right hand and pressed a cyan-colored button on the side of the couch. ""Aurora, this is what you wanted. Let's begin.""

Whoosh!

All the screens lit up instantly, and the broadcast studio was suddenly bright.

Brightness was restored, and the scene appeared again.

An ancient mansion slowly appeared on the screen.

Luther held the microphone and said, ""This trial is carried out using the subconscious memory extraction technique provided by Galaxy Tech of Laberge Group. We extracted the memories of Aurora herself and some people who were involved in her youth, as well as those related to Fright Case 624. Due to time constraints, all memories have been edited into a clip in the presence of notaries, leaving behind Aurora's behavior as a child that is related to the case to ensure strict justice in the trial. The first memory will begin playing.""

""Memory backtracking? They're replaying the past?"" In Private Room No. 1, Christine was stunned for a moment. Then, she raised her eyes slightly to look at the middle private room on the second floor and thought, ""Jasper is allowing them to replay Aurora's memory?""

Her assistant, Hannah Lawrence, approached and asked in a low voice, ""Christine, are you okay?""

Christine came back to her senses. She shook her head and whispered, ""I can hold on.""

Hannah's eyes turned red, and she wanted to say something, but the image on the screen was already fully focused.

Someone wondered aloud, ""Is this the environment in which Aurora grew up as a child?""

""Some people used their childhood to heal their lives, while some people needed a lifetime to heal the trauma of childhood. Childhood and family are really crucial to the development of a person's personality,"" a person commented.

Then, someone exclaimed, ""It doesn't seem to be Aurora's home. That's... the Laberge residence!""

""I heard that Aurora's father was the security guard while her mother was a nanny at the Laberge residence. Therefore, Aurora grew up in the Laberge residence.""

""So, Aurora and Mr. Laberge basically grew up together?""

In the picture, the Laberge residence covered an area of over 700 thousand square feet. An avenue lined with sycamore trees led to a large mansion in the depths.

It was late autumn, and the leaves of sycamore trees fell on the ground. The scene was very surreal-looking.

In the security guard booth at the main gate, a little girl around ten years old in a yellow doll dress squatted at the door. She looked deep beyond the sycamore trees with her big round eyes.

Right where she looked, another little girl wearing a princess dress was holding a small bottle and blowing bubbles with a boy.

The bubbles in the sky reflected different colors and floated into the leaves of the sycamore trees.

The little boy leaned against a sycamore tree, with one hand holding a branch and the other in his trouser pocket. His lips were pursed tightly. At such a young age, he already looked distant.

The audience was stunned and immediately began to discuss the matter.

""Is this when Mr. Laberge was a child?""

""Mr. Laberge was so delicate and gorgeous when he was a child. So his aura has been already like that since childhood.""

""The one wearing the princess dress is Christine. So the rumors weren't wrong. The two of them are really childhood friends.""

""The young lady squatting at the security guard booth is Aurora. She has been a beauty since childhood.""

""The Witch probably relies on her face to achieve her goal step by step.""

""Look, her staring at Mr. Laberge was full of eagerness and desperation. She is just the daughter of the security guard and nanny. Growing up in such a rich environment as the Laberge residence is a life she desperately wants but cannot have.""

""I guess it's because she grew up in such a dissatisfied environment that her psychological state became distorted later. This is because her parents didn't do a good job of educating her.""

""Indeed, if her parents had raised her well since childhood, she wouldn't have become like this!""

The video continued to play.

Suddenly, everyone was stunned.

Aurora, who squatted at the door, grabbed a bottle of disinfectant next to her and ran toward the young Jasper when little Christine left for the mansion to wash her dirtied hands.

""I'll disinfect the germs for you."" The young Aurora rushed to the delicate boy and sprayed him with disinfectant.

She even took his hand, poured the disinfectant on it, and fished out a bag of tissues to clean it off for him carefully.

""It's okay. It will be fine as long as the germs are gone."" Aurora comforted him while wiping his hands.

The boy's furrowed eyebrows gradually relaxed.

Aurora took the branch and threw it aside. She said seriously, ""It's not right to beat guests.""

The audience was confused.

Something did not seem right.

# Chapter 3 She Was His Sunshine

After Aurora disinfected Jasper, he raised the collar of her yellow blouse and said proudly, ""Are you that bored to stand guard here all this time? Go do your homework.""

Aurora looked dissappointed as he led her away.

The little girl in the princess dress ran back happily after washing her hands, only to fail to find Jasper.

Standing under the sycamore tree, she instantly burst into tears.

For a moment, silence ensued in the broadcast studio.

Christine, who was in Private Room No. 1, had a brief look of surprise in her beautiful eyes, but she quickly recovered and smiled at everyone, wearing a helpless expression.

""Jas has had germophobia since childhood, unbeknownst to me. I even constantly dragged him around to do this and that. Aurora was always secretly helping him disinfect.""

A hint of nostalgia appeared in Christine's eyes as she murmured, ""Come to think of it, Jas must have really wanted to beat me up, huh? Everything was so wonderful back then. I almost forgot that I was even a crybaby when I was little.""

""Christine, don't be sad. You've been gorgeous since you were a child. Aurora can never compare to you.""

""The more wonderful their youth was, the more painful it is now, I bet. I can just imagine how Christine feels right now.""

""But I indeed didn't expect Aurora to live in the Laberge residence.""

""She and Mr. Laberge seemed pretty close when they were young. Mr. Laberge didn't let Christine touch him, yet he took the initiative to hold Aurora's hand.""

All of a sudden, there was silence.

Everything the audience said at present could be heard by Jasper, who was in Private Room No. 9.

The comments in the live room, too, were sent to the screen of the private room in real-time.

Despite Jasper's severe germophobia, he befriended Aurora and had complete faith only in her. Alas, what he got in return was a betrayal.

Everyone could empathize with him.

""How painful must that be! Does Jasper hate Aurora?"" they thought.

However, Jasper had never said anything about it, so no one had a clue.

In Private Room No. 9, Brentley carefully observed Jasper's expression.

""Brentley,"" Jasper called out suddenly. Under the beast mask, his jaw was tightly clenched. ""Call up the scene of the guard post.""

""Got it."" Promptly, Brentley picked up the laptop, called up the scene, and projected it on another LCD screen.

Through the mask, Jasper's sharp gaze landed on the face of the little girl squatting at the guard post in the scene.

He tightened his fists.

""Is Mr. Laberge observing Aurora's expression?"" Brentley thought. He couldn't help but take a few glances at Aurora on the screen again.

She was looking at Jasper and Christine playing under the sycamore tree in the distance, and there was indeed longing in her big eyes, as the audience had said.

Nevertheless, judging from this longing and the subsequent disinfection, she was probably more concerned that Jasper would be uncomfortable due to his germophobia.

At this moment, Brentley noticed a detail in the scene. When Aurora watched the two children play, there seemed to be slight sorrow in her eyes.

But only a second after, she returned to staring fixedly at the boy by the sycamore tree, concerned about his germophobia.

""Sorrow?"" Brentley became tense.

""Had this woman learned how to pretend at such a young age?"" he wondered.

Had he not looked closely, he would not have noticed her true feelings concealed by her concern.

""Is Mr. Laberge verifying?"" Brentley wanted to see Jasper's reaction, but he did not have the courage.

All of Jasper's emotions were hidden behind the mask.

His eyes fixated for a few seconds on the lonely eyes of ten-year-old Aurora before eventually moving away.

The scene continued.

This was a happy time. Two ten-year-old children grew up carefreely in the vast manor.

What surprised everyone was that ten-year-old Aurora was cheerful, lively, and exceptionally adorable.

Jasper, on the other hand, was reticent and wore a straight face since he was young, but there was no lack of happiness in his life.

All of that was brought to him by Aurora.

The two climbed trees to catch birds, waded into rivers to fish, scaled walls to cause mischief, and also studied hard together.

They never quarreled and always played together.

Clearly, they were two innocent playmates!

The tiny Aurora always had a bright, lovely smile on her face.

The audience noticed that Jasper always looked fairly happier when he was with Aurora.

A doubt then appeared in everyone's mind.

""This can't be right. How could such a cheerful, energetic child become so scary in the future?""

""Aurora was practically a little sunshine when she was young. No matter how good she is at pretense, she can't possibly pretend that well when she was only ten years old.""

""Agreed. There was no darkness in these memories, and people's subconscious would not hide it on purpose.""

Right then, a psychologist who was present spoke up. ""We've assessed this memory professionally and concluded that her feelings were real, without any pretense. Also, these memories came from Aurora's parents and other servants from her childhood as well. All of them are genuine, valid, and without falsification.""

He continued, ""Additionally, we have just analyzed Aurora's memory and behavior. Based on what we've seen thus far, her heart is filled with positivity, and she has very little chance of turning evil in the future.""

Upon hearing this, everybody was astonished.

""Since memory won't go wrong, why did such a cheery girl become a witch in the future?""

""Are behavior predictions always accurate? Perhaps some evil is etched in the bones and will only erupt at a specific time.""

""Maybe significant changes happened later and caused her temperament to shift drastically.""

""But her childhood was so full of energy. Could a few incidents really cause such drastic changes in her temperament? She isn't just bad but sinful and more terrifying than typical murderers!""

""I reckon it could be related to the incident of the Laberge family. Thereafter, a tragedy happened to the Laberge family.""

While the audience discussed, the scene changed.

Aurora was 12 years old, and it was a hot, dry summer night without any breeze.

A small, black car discreetly drove in through the gate to the path lined with sycamore trees before stopping directly in front of the Laberge residence.

Four masked men in black got out of the vehicle, each holding a machete, and rushed into the mansion menacingly.

Soon, screams came from the residence.

The man and lady of the house were tied up and brought out by the criminals, both of them injured.

Meanwhile, the third man trailing behind carried a motionless little boy on his shoulder.

""Jasper! Don't hurt my son!"" The Laberge couple began to struggle violently.

Unfortunately, shortly after, they were knocked out by the criminals, dragged into the car, and taken away.

""Jasper!"" When the car passed by the guard post, Aurora ran out from inside.

""Aurora, don't go!"" A young couple ran after her and stopped her.

They were Aurora's parents, Fabian and Caroline.

""Let go of me! The bad guys took them. I'm going to save Jasper!""

Aurora struggled fiercely. At 12 years old, she had grown taller, but it was still difficult for her to break free from the strength of adults.

Suddenly, she lowered her head, bit Fabian's hand, and shouted, ""Dad, you're supposed to be the Laberge family's guard, yet you let the bad guys in! If you don't dare to save them, I will!""

At last, Aurora broke free from her parents' hands and rushed into the night without hesitation.

# Chapter 4 I Will Carry You Out

Aurora kept running in the streets at night.

She had called the police before while using the electronic watch Jasper gave her to locate him.

Thankfully, the police department acted swiftly and confronted the criminals.

However, Aurora disappeared.

Back then, the abduction happening to the Laberge family caused a sensation in Yrinas, and some details could still be found online.

Some netizens had already started searching for that year's case to supply additional information through internet.

\[This matter was determined to be a contract killing, and the mastermind hasn't been found yet.\]

\[In the police department's report on this case back then, they did mention that the Laberge family's guard's daughter was the one who called the police, but there was no further news about Aurora.\]

\[She clearly chased after them, but why did she disappear? Still, given how young she was, she could've been hiding out of fear.\]

\[The fact that those beasts could enter the Laberge residence so easily was not mentioned in the report back then. Doesn't that mean it was all because Fabian failed to guard the gate properly?\]

\[Yes, that car drove in so effortlessly! Could it be that Fabian conspired with the criminals and let them in?\]

\[Looks like we've found this beast's hereditary genes. With such cruel parents, it's no surprise their daughter grew up to be scum!\]

While everyone was speculating, a deafening boom sounded in the scene.

The mountain cabin where the Laberge family was confined had caught fire.

In the burning flames, a boy was fighting against an adult male.

The boy was so young, yet his moves were extremely aggressive. Despite knowing his strength could never compete with an adult's, he was not afraid.

He promptly swung a stool and struck the man, causing the latter to fall to the ground with a thud.

Sadly, he, too, collapsed from exhaustion.

The fire was getting increasingly bigger, and the thick smoke quickly submerged the surrounding area.

""It's Mr. Jasper Laberge!""

""How brave! A 12-year-old boy actually defeated a crook.""

""Geez! I can't believe Mr. Laberge was so impressive as a child. But he was also badly injured and had no strength left.""

""Mr. Laberge, wake up! The fire is approaching!""

Although the audience knew that Jasper was well and sitting in the private room, the sight of the large fire at the scene still unnerved them.

At the scene, the fire showed no signs of easing at all.

Pieces of wood from the beams fell one after another, and some even almost hit Jasper.

Time ticked away second by second.

Out of the blue, a tiny figure in the corner struggled to stand up while using the wall as support.

""Jasper...""

She staggered toward Jasper, carried him on her back, and headed for the door strenuously.

The smoke was so thick that it choked her, making her coughing incessantly.

""Is that Aurora?""

""So, she had long found Mr. Laberge. Did she fight the criminals earlier too?""

The fire drew the irritable audience's attention.

""According to the case, when Mr. Jasper Laberge was found, he was lying on the mountain road outside, and it was Christine who saved him.""

""Yes, that was what the record stated. Christine had run up the mountain and rescued Mr. Jasper Laberge in spite of her family's objection. But why are we seeing Aurora rush out of the fire with Mr. Laberge now instead?""

In the scene, Aurora abruptly halted in her tracks.

She carefully placed the unconscious Jasper on the ground and removed her coat to wrap around his mouth and nose.

""Jasper, don't be afraid. I'll definitely carry you out."" Then, she clenched her jaw, grunted, and piggybacked him once again.

As she was much smaller than Jasper in physique, it took her a lot of effort to carry him on her back.

In the meantime, the flames had spread over.

""Run... Quick... You fool..."" Jasper strained to open his eyes, raised his hand, and pulled her arm. ""Leave me behind...""

""No!"" Aurora wrapped her arms tightly around his body behind her back. ""I said I'd carry you out.""

Cough!

She had given Jasper her clothes to block the smoke, so the moment she opened her mouth to speak, she felt lightheaded from choking on the dense smoke.

Jasper extended a hand to cover Aurora's nose but immediately fell unconscious for a second time.

He was more severely injured than Aurora and had already depleted all his strength.

Boom!

Without warning, a burning beam of the cabin fell. While carrying Jasper on her back, Aurora somehow found the strength to dodge it.

Nevertheless, she stumbled.

The moment she fell, she used her frail body to cushion Jasper.

A loud thud could be heard as she bumped her head on the coffee table at the side. Her eyes then rolled to the back of her head, and she fainted in the next instant.

Yet, that was only for a brief moment. To everyone's surprise, she quickly regained consciousness!

""I can't fall! I can't fall down. I can't..."" Aurora said to herself firmly.

Aurora seemed to have infinite energy inside her petite body. She gritted her teeth and, once more, carried the unconscious Jasper on her back.

One step, two steps...

Each time she fell, she got to her feet, and this cycle kept on repeating.

By now, the thick smoke around them had engulfed everything, and nothing could be seen.

Even adults wouldn't be able to escape from such a large fire and dense smoke.

Yet, Aurora, a little girl, carrying a taller boy on her back, used all her might and brought him step by step to the light at the door.

Even though the flames burned her hair and eyelashes, she did not even make a sound.

She simply kept repeating unconsciously, ""Jasper, don't be afraid. I'll carry you out. I'll definitely carry you out.""

The studio fell into a dead silence.

Everyone stared intently at the screen while tightening their fists.

They thought, 'Why? You were so kind and brave back then. Why did you later become a witch?

Why in the world is that, Aurora Youngblood?'

The victims' families, who were present, trembled from head to toe while their eyes filled with tears.

They were all asking the same question in their hearts.

They thought angrily, 'Aurora, why did you become so cruel later?

You risked your life when you were 12 to save your friend. Even adults might not be as courageous as you. So, why on earth did you become a witch ten years later and wickedly harm those innocent children?

Why did you become a villain?'

It was precisely because Aurora was so courageous and touching back then that everyone found it difficult to accept her changing.

""She was clearly a diamond in the rough. Why did she later become so corrupted?"" ruminated the crowd.

A burst of sorrow and rage spread from everyone's heart and surged.

They wanted to rush into the screen, grab Aurora, and fiercely demand her to give them an explanation.

With a bang, the door of the cabin collapsed in the fire.

In the scene, Aurora finally made it out with Jasper on her back.

She didn't dare to stop or look back, though.

While piggybacking Jasper, Aurora lurched down the mountain like a robot.

Boom!

The cabin exploded behind Aurora.

Still, she didn't look back. Her small teeth bit her lip, drawing blood that quickly dried up and stuck to the corner of her mouth.

Gradually, the cabin faded away from sight.

Dogs were barking at the foot of the mountain, signaling that the rescuers had arrived.

Aurora climbed up a tall slope with Jasper on her back. When she saw the flashlights light up at the foot of the mountain, she strained to widen her eyes.

""Jasper, the rescuers are here.""

A smile appeared on her face. With that, she relaxed, and her legs went limp.

After putting Jasper on the ground, Aurora turned around and staggered into the deep mountains.

""Mr. Laberge... I must save Mr. Laberge!""

""What? She still had energy!""

""Where on earth did she get the determination to keep saving people even when she was nearly drained of energy herself?""

In the broadcast studio, the audience was feeling beyond conflicted.

They abominated this witch, Aurora.

Regardless, they could not hate the 12-year-old Aurora upon seeing her tiny figure heading deeper into the dark mountain amidst the raging fire.

All of a sudden, someone sighed faintly. ""Child, don't go. Your Mr. Laberge is already gone.""

It then went so silent in the studio that one could hear a pin drop.

# Chapter 5 What Do You Think Of Her

The criminals detained the three Laberges in three different places.

Jasper's father, Nick Laberge, trapped in the deepest part of the mountain, had long died before he was found.

Jasper was found by Christine and the search and rescue personnel on the mountain road.

As for Jasper's mother, Whitney Laberge, she was the first to be rescued but also covered with injuries after being tortured by the criminals.

In the scene, Aurora knelt before Nick's body. Albeit clumsy, she pressed his chest with her two small hands non-stop.

""Please don't die, Mr. Laberge! Wake up! What should Jasper do if you're dead? Don't die...""

""Young lady, he has been dead for hours. There's no way he can be saved."" The rescuers rushed in and pulled her away.

Abruptly, Aurora stopped and turned her head stiffly to look at the rescuers.

""Sir, you're lying to me, aren't you? You're lying..."" Tears rolled down her big eyes. ""It's not true... What should Jasper do? He has lost his father.""

""Young lady! Quick! She's gone into shock! Get the stretcher over here now!""

Aurora sank into a nightmare.

The scenes were messy and fragmented, filled with chaotic recollections.

There were fires, screams and cries, and the car that drove into the Laberge residence late at night.

Aurora kept chasing after that vehicle relentlessly.

Suddenly, the scene was interrupted, and the screen went dark.

In Private Room No. 9, Jasper pressed the blue button beside the couch, and his knuckle turned pale from the strength he exerted.

He closed his eyes and leaned against the couch, his lips pressing tightly. It was impossible to guess what he was thinking.

""Mr. Laberge, I'll ask them to change the content immediately,"" Brentley said hurriedly.

The Laberge family's tragedy that year had hurt Jasper deeply.

""Damn! Why did the studio broadcast these memories in this trial?"" pondered Brentley.

Jasper lowered his gaze and rubbed the rosary beads with his fingertips. ""This is her memory,"" he said in a low voice.

""Whose?"" Brentley was stunned.

It then immediately dawned on him that Jasper was talking about Aurora.

This memory of saving people belonged to Aurora.

""It's a memory that no one knows.""

Jasper dipped his head and inspected the rosary beads in his hand. His index finger swiped across the top half of the circle, and he buckled the eighth bead under his knuckle before gently tracing the ""A"" engraved on it.

Even he had only just learned how hard she had tried to save him at that time.

Jasper shut his eyes and recalled the scene that he just witnessed.

He had an incredibly rare dynamic memory, so his memory ability surpassed most people.

With his eyes closed now, he saw Aurora struggling to advance in the fire with him on her back, and every single detail of the scene replicated what was previously played.

There were fire, smoke, coughing, and that metal piece shattered from the fire, which struck Aurora's right calf and left a scar that could never heal.

All of a sudden, Jasper raised his head and looked at Brentley emotionlessly through the beast mask. ""Brentley, what do you think of her?""

""I..."" Brentley was struck dumb.

If they were only talking about the 12-year-old Aurora, he couldn't hate or dislike her. On the contrary, he'd even deeply admire her.

However, he thought of those evil acts she committed later and her act of stealing Laberge Group's trade secrets, causing the company to almost plunge into an irreparable situation.

""I'm sorry, Mr. Laberge. I can't forgive her."" Brentley voiced his thoughts honestly.

Indeed, Aurora used to be a good person, but that didn't mean it could offset what she did subsequently.

Such was how the world worked.

The law would never allow anyone to forget about her misdeeds either.

Brentley thought, 'Moreover, those memories just now should have reminded Mr. Laberge of his painful childhood memories, right?

But why is he asking about Aurora instead?'

Brentley looked at his boss apprehensively, unable to figure out what the latter was thinking.

Everyone believed that Jasper loathed Aurora.

However, Jasper had never explicitly said that before.

Sometime later, Jasper released the button and said flatly, ""No need to change it.""

Brentley's heart skipped a beat.

""Mr. Laberge chose this memory?"" he mused.

With that, the screen lit up again.

Clips of other people's memories of the Laberge family tragedy started playing.

In that incident, one of the Laberge family members died and two were injured, whereas all four criminals died on the spot.

As the real mastermind was on the run, the case went cold.

Christine stayed by Jasper's bed all the time.

In Private Room No. 1, Christine looked at the screen in a daze. ""So, it was you.""

A tear drop slipped from the corner of her eye.

She quickly wiped it away and smiled at the camera. ""It was said that I saved Jas, but the cabin had actually been destroyed when we found him. I didn't know until today that Aurora had done so much back then."" Her eyes brightened. ""This is you, Aurora Youngblood. You've always, always been so kind."" She looked at the camera and flashed a relieved grin. ""Everyone saw that, right? She's so brave, strong, and kind.""

""Christine, you still trust her so much."" Hannah was rather lost for words.

In the live room, fans were exceptionally heartbroken when they heard Christine's words.

\[Christine has always believed that Witch is innocent. She must be especially moved to see what Aurora did just now.\]

\[I'm distressed when I see Lady Christine cry too. It's undeniable that the 12-year-old Aurora is admirable. However, it can never erase those crimes she later committed!\]

\[I think I know why Christine still believes in Aurora even now. After all, Aurora was indeed really kind as a child. That's why Christine doesn't want to believe Aurora would become so vicious.\]

\[Wake up, Christine. She's just pretending!\]

In the broadcast studio, the criminal psychologists and pedagogy experts heard Christine's words and expressed their opinions.

The audience was in a conflicted mood.

Abruptly, someone questioned, ""Why wasn't that despicable couple who allowed the criminals into the Laberge residence punished?""",1,1753699251.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False
1mbcrir,https://www.reddit.com/r/Novelnews/comments/1mbcrir/his_quest_for_her_innocence_novel_free_link_site/,His Quest For Her Innocence Novel free link site..?,"# Chapter 1 Trial

""The witch, Aurora Youngblood, is finally caught! She has committed Fright Case 624, consisting of extraordinarily large-scale abduction cases and trade secret theft. She has ruined 48 lives! The number of crimes she committed is too many to record and has drawn the anger of all! Today, Yrinas News will cooperate with the police department to expose the matter and publicize her crimes!"" Within Yrinas News' broadcast studio, the host, Luther Quiggs, held up and spoke into the microphone. He had red eyes and a complex mood.

Aurora was supposed to be a beautiful name. However, it was now synonymously known as the Witch.

Fright Case 624 left a terrible impact on society. Therefore, Yrinas decided to broadcast a live show to publicize Aurora's evil deeds as a warning to all.

The live broadcast was different from before.

Aurora's case was not fully solved, and she was now in custody. However, the crimes she committed were still pending trial.

Therefore, the trial process would be publicized in this live broadcast.

Meanwhile, the investigation method adopted was an unprecedented high-tech technology—performing a memory extraction technique on a human's subconscious.

This technology was developed and provided by Laberge Group's Galaxy Tech.

""He promised her in front of the world that he would develop the most advanced Artificial Intelligence and extract memories from a human's deepest consciousness to make her proud for him,"" someone commented.

Another added, ""And he succeeded. However, the woman he loved not only betrayed him but also became a malicious Witch!""

""Mr. Laberge must be very sad. Aurora deserves to die!""

""Expose her crimes. Even the death penalty is a mercy to that woman!""

The audience seats were filled with people, and those enthusiastic viewers from all walks of life talked about it. Everyone was filled with righteous indignation and wanted to rush to the prison to tear Aurora into pieces.

Jasper Laberge was a man who could move the whole of Clusia.

Upon mention of his name, everyone hurriedly kept silent.

They talked about Aurora's evil deeds, but they did not dare to mention her past with Jasper.

This had already become a taboo.

""The guests are here!"" With the introduction of the host, guests arrived one after another.

A lot of experts from many domains were invited to this live stream.

Among them, the ones who garnered the most attention were famous criminal psychologists and educational experts in Clusia. They would analyze Aurora's criminal psychological state throughout the whole process and use it as a lesson to educate the public.

""Is that the best actress, Christine Rivera?"" someone muttered.

There was a commotion at the scene, and everyone's gaze landed on the beautiful woman who slowly stepped on the stage.

The audience in the live stream also became agitated.

""Mr. Laberge is not the only one who feels sad. Lady Christine is also extremely upset.""

""She is probably here today because she doesn't believe Aurora is the Witch. Silly child, stop believing in her!""

""Her best friend became the fiancée of her childhood sweetheart. She lost her love and now friendship too. I feel so sorry for Lady Christine.""

Luther handed the microphone to Christine and said, ""Ms. Rivera, I know you are in a somber mood now. You can choose not to come, so why did you come here in person?""

Before Christine's red lips parted, her eyes reddened first. She glanced at the audience and forced a smile. ""Sorry, I still don't believe it. So, I want to see it for myself. I hope there will be a miracle and that the person I trust most was only wrongfully accused of her crimes.""

The audience and her fans in the stream shouted painfully, ""What kind of miracle? The evidence is conclusive. She failed you, Mr. Laberge, and everyone! Don't believe her anymore. Hasn't she hurt you enough?""

Christine's gaze shifted slightly as she sadly looked at the guest's private room on the second floor in the back row of the stage.

She shook her head slowly at the camera. ""Sorry, but he and I firmly believe in her.""

With that, she bowed deeply to everyone.

""I'm crying. You're so silly."" Her fans were in tears.

Someone wondered, ""Is the person she just mentioned... Mr. Laberge? Mr. Laberge is also here? Is he in the private room at the back?""

Everyone looked at the nine guest's private rooms split into three layers on the stage.

At this moment, the glass doors of other private rooms were all open. Only the one in the middle of the second floor with ""nine"" written on it was closed.

There was light inside, and a tall figure sitting on the couch could be vaguely seen.

Away from the camera's reach, the man sitting on the leather couch wore an exquisite silver-colored beast mask on his face.

His exposed lips were tightly pressed together. He was dressed in a suit with the color of thick, black ink. He looked distant and unapproachable.

This man exuded an intimidating aura.

He was young, but he was as silent as an ancient statue.

""Mr. Laberge, it's about to start."" Brentley Yablon, the assistant, stood at the side and did not dare to make a sound.

They heard Christine's words from the private room.

""No one can guess Mr. Laberge's thoughts clearly,"" Brentley thought.

Everyone was waiting for Aurora's trial.

Meanwhile, Jasper had never said anything about it.

No one even dared to mention it in front of him.

There were seven more guests in masks outside, some men and some women. They entered seven of the private rooms respectively.

Christine glanced at Jasper's private room with sad eyes. In the end, she did not join him but entered Private Room No. 1, which was near the host's platform on the edge of the first floor.

Her behavior made the fans feel sorry for her.

Jasper kept silent in Private Room No. 9 at the center of the second floor.

After a long time, a finger of his left hand raised slightly.

Brentley understood the silent command. He walked to the glass door and pressed a special button.

When the broadcast studio received the instruction, the director immediately notified the host, Luther.

Luther announced, ""The live broadcast will officially start now. On behalf of Yrinas News, I would like to thank all the guests present. I also hope that during the live broadcast, the audience and those in the live room will keep calm and not give extreme remarks. The tragedy has already happened. We are all sad and angry but we are sober-minded. Now, let's reveal the true face of the Witch.""

As Luther finished speaking, a middle-aged couple appeared on the stage.

As soon as the couple appeared, the audience immediately got agitated, especially the families of the victims. A group of the victims' families came to the scene today, looking at the couple as if the latter were their sworn foes.

One person shouted first. ""Get out! How dare you come here when you raised such a daughter!""

""The parents of trash are still trash. Get out of the broadcast studio!""

""Get lost!""

Fabian Youngblood and Caroline Youngblood held each other. They shuddered and lowered their heads, daring not to look at the audience.

""We're sorry."" The couple bowed tremblingly in front of the camera. Their white hair from their temples was scattered on their wrinkled cheeks.

""Sorry!"" They looked at the camera, bent their backs, then said again, ""We're sorry, and we'll atone for her sins.""

A plastic bottle was thrown at the stage.

One of the victims' family members shouted angrily, ""My son was only three years old. He is already dead, so what's the use of your atonement?""

""Give me back my son!"" another person yelled.

Someone else cried, ""Return my daughter's life! My poor daughter, I'm so sorry that I was useless and that I couldn't save you!""

The crowd was agitated.

Although the security guards were there to maintain order, they merely blocked the audience from rushing to the stage.

More and more people grew upset.

Fabian and Caroline shuddered. Suddenly, they looked up at the private rooms in the north of the stage. Their gazes were fixated on the closed glass door of the centremost room.

They trembled even more violently and bowed desperately to the camera. ""We're sorry. Aurora has done a grave sin. We're sorry...""

However, no one wanted such an apology.

While the people were cursing Fabian and Caroline, the screen lit up. It showed a prison.

The camera zoomed into an interrogation room. It finally stopped on a young woman in a yellow prison uniform with handcuffs.

""Aurora Youngblood, do you plead guilty to all these evil acts? Do you regret it?"" the inspector asked her.

Aurora looked down carefully at the silver handcuffs on her wrist.

Even after hearing the question, she did not raise her head.

She paused for a few seconds and said slowly in a hoarse and gravelly voice, ""I admit everything I did, but I have no regrets.""

# Chapter 2 Man With A Beast Mask

Whoosh!

The audience on site burst into an uproar, and the comment section in the live room became chaotic instantly.

""No regrets? She's unrepentant!""

""This woman is so hateful. She has ended the lives of so many people and still doesn't feel any regrets!""

""Sentence her to death immediately!""

The victims' families even rushed up and wanted to smash the screen.

They came here today to see Aurora get punished. They wanted her to confess and be repentant, and hear her apology to their dead relatives.

However, Aurora claimed to have no regrets.

Nobody could accept such a proclamation.

""Everyone, please calm down!"" The criminal psychologist stood up and motioned to everyone, then said, ""This is a typical sociopathic personality. The victim's anger will only excite her and give her a perverted sense of satisfaction. Since you are here to participate in this trial, I believe the police department will give you justice. Agitation can't solve anything. When the evidence of her crimes is confirmed, her true colors will be exposed. At that time, she will have no choice but to admit to her sins. Please be patient. Justice will always prevail!""

""Yes, justice lasts forever, so let's be rational,"" Luther shouted into the microphone in his hand.

He was as angry as the victims' families, but he knew his responsibilities.

Now was not the time to make a scene.

""Please be quiet. The trial begins now!"" Luther said.

As soon as he finished speaking, the light on the screen gradually dimmed.

In the scene, Aurora slowly stood up from the interrogation chair with handcuffs on her wrists and feet and walked outside step by step.

She kept her head down and turned her back to the camera.

The lights gradually dimmed, and her figure was also getting further from the camera.

Aurora was very thin, and her back was almost skeletal. The yellow prison uniform hung on her body like an ill-fitting cloth sack.

She walked step by step in the distance silently like a walking corpse.

Suddenly, she stopped.

She raised her hand slightly and wanted to rub her abdomen, but when she heard the collision of chains at her wrist, she put it down quickly.

Then, Aurora continued to move forward step by step.

She knew her trial had begun, and many people were watching her now, including that person.

""Jasper..."" Aurora muttered silently. His name was stuck in her heart, and it hurt her so much.

She had not had the courage to say it out for a long time.

""You didn't see my face, right? I have only a few days left. We won't see each other again."" Aurora smiled, and her eyes gradually brightened.

She was full of strength at the thought of him, just like how it had been in every second, minute, and year in the past throughout her twenty-five years of life.

The camera receded, and the scene turned dark.

At the same time, the ongoing rage in the broadcast studio was also drowned in the darkness.

In Private Room No. 9, Jasper remained sitting upright and motionless. From the beginning to the end, he did not show any emotion.

He just looked at the specially made 3D holographic projection screen in front of him quietly.

Just now, Aurora's holographic projection made it seem like she was standing in front of him.

She was thin, proud, and unyielding as always.

Jasper stared at the dark spot in the middle of the screen. He lifted his right hand and pressed a cyan-colored button on the side of the couch. ""Aurora, this is what you wanted. Let's begin.""

Whoosh!

All the screens lit up instantly, and the broadcast studio was suddenly bright.

Brightness was restored, and the scene appeared again.

An ancient mansion slowly appeared on the screen.

Luther held the microphone and said, ""This trial is carried out using the subconscious memory extraction technique provided by Galaxy Tech of Laberge Group. We extracted the memories of Aurora herself and some people who were involved in her youth, as well as those related to Fright Case 624. Due to time constraints, all memories have been edited into a clip in the presence of notaries, leaving behind Aurora's behavior as a child that is related to the case to ensure strict justice in the trial. The first memory will begin playing.""

""Memory backtracking? They're replaying the past?"" In Private Room No. 1, Christine was stunned for a moment. Then, she raised her eyes slightly to look at the middle private room on the second floor and thought, ""Jasper is allowing them to replay Aurora's memory?""

Her assistant, Hannah Lawrence, approached and asked in a low voice, ""Christine, are you okay?""

Christine came back to her senses. She shook her head and whispered, ""I can hold on.""

Hannah's eyes turned red, and she wanted to say something, but the image on the screen was already fully focused.

Someone wondered aloud, ""Is this the environment in which Aurora grew up as a child?""

""Some people used their childhood to heal their lives, while some people needed a lifetime to heal the trauma of childhood. Childhood and family are really crucial to the development of a person's personality,"" a person commented.

Then, someone exclaimed, ""It doesn't seem to be Aurora's home. That's... the Laberge residence!""

""I heard that Aurora's father was the security guard while her mother was a nanny at the Laberge residence. Therefore, Aurora grew up in the Laberge residence.""

""So, Aurora and Mr. Laberge basically grew up together?""

In the picture, the Laberge residence covered an area of over 700 thousand square feet. An avenue lined with sycamore trees led to a large mansion in the depths.

It was late autumn, and the leaves of sycamore trees fell on the ground. The scene was very surreal-looking.

In the security guard booth at the main gate, a little girl around ten years old in a yellow doll dress squatted at the door. She looked deep beyond the sycamore trees with her big round eyes.

Right where she looked, another little girl wearing a princess dress was holding a small bottle and blowing bubbles with a boy.

The bubbles in the sky reflected different colors and floated into the leaves of the sycamore trees.

The little boy leaned against a sycamore tree, with one hand holding a branch and the other in his trouser pocket. His lips were pursed tightly. At such a young age, he already looked distant.

The audience was stunned and immediately began to discuss the matter.

""Is this when Mr. Laberge was a child?""

""Mr. Laberge was so delicate and gorgeous when he was a child. So his aura has been already like that since childhood.""

""The one wearing the princess dress is Christine. So the rumors weren't wrong. The two of them are really childhood friends.""

""The young lady squatting at the security guard booth is Aurora. She has been a beauty since childhood.""

""The Witch probably relies on her face to achieve her goal step by step.""

""Look, her staring at Mr. Laberge was full of eagerness and desperation. She is just the daughter of the security guard and nanny. Growing up in such a rich environment as the Laberge residence is a life she desperately wants but cannot have.""

""I guess it's because she grew up in such a dissatisfied environment that her psychological state became distorted later. This is because her parents didn't do a good job of educating her.""

""Indeed, if her parents had raised her well since childhood, she wouldn't have become like this!""

The video continued to play.

Suddenly, everyone was stunned.

Aurora, who squatted at the door, grabbed a bottle of disinfectant next to her and ran toward the young Jasper when little Christine left for the mansion to wash her dirtied hands.

""I'll disinfect the germs for you."" The young Aurora rushed to the delicate boy and sprayed him with disinfectant.

She even took his hand, poured the disinfectant on it, and fished out a bag of tissues to clean it off for him carefully.

""It's okay. It will be fine as long as the germs are gone."" Aurora comforted him while wiping his hands.

The boy's furrowed eyebrows gradually relaxed.

Aurora took the branch and threw it aside. She said seriously, ""It's not right to beat guests.""

The audience was confused.

Something did not seem right.

# Chapter 3 She Was His Sunshine

After Aurora disinfected Jasper, he raised the collar of her yellow blouse and said proudly, ""Are you that bored to stand guard here all this time? Go do your homework.""

Aurora looked dissappointed as he led her away.

The little girl in the princess dress ran back happily after washing her hands, only to fail to find Jasper.

Standing under the sycamore tree, she instantly burst into tears.

For a moment, silence ensued in the broadcast studio.

Christine, who was in Private Room No. 1, had a brief look of surprise in her beautiful eyes, but she quickly recovered and smiled at everyone, wearing a helpless expression.

""Jas has had germophobia since childhood, unbeknownst to me. I even constantly dragged him around to do this and that. Aurora was always secretly helping him disinfect.""

A hint of nostalgia appeared in Christine's eyes as she murmured, ""Come to think of it, Jas must have really wanted to beat me up, huh? Everything was so wonderful back then. I almost forgot that I was even a crybaby when I was little.""

""Christine, don't be sad. You've been gorgeous since you were a child. Aurora can never compare to you.""

""The more wonderful their youth was, the more painful it is now, I bet. I can just imagine how Christine feels right now.""

""But I indeed didn't expect Aurora to live in the Laberge residence.""

""She and Mr. Laberge seemed pretty close when they were young. Mr. Laberge didn't let Christine touch him, yet he took the initiative to hold Aurora's hand.""

All of a sudden, there was silence.

Everything the audience said at present could be heard by Jasper, who was in Private Room No. 9.

The comments in the live room, too, were sent to the screen of the private room in real-time.

Despite Jasper's severe germophobia, he befriended Aurora and had complete faith only in her. Alas, what he got in return was a betrayal.

Everyone could empathize with him.

""How painful must that be! Does Jasper hate Aurora?"" they thought.

However, Jasper had never said anything about it, so no one had a clue.

In Private Room No. 9, Brentley carefully observed Jasper's expression.

""Brentley,"" Jasper called out suddenly. Under the beast mask, his jaw was tightly clenched. ""Call up the scene of the guard post.""

""Got it."" Promptly, Brentley picked up the laptop, called up the scene, and projected it on another LCD screen.

Through the mask, Jasper's sharp gaze landed on the face of the little girl squatting at the guard post in the scene.

He tightened his fists.

""Is Mr. Laberge observing Aurora's expression?"" Brentley thought. He couldn't help but take a few glances at Aurora on the screen again.

She was looking at Jasper and Christine playing under the sycamore tree in the distance, and there was indeed longing in her big eyes, as the audience had said.

Nevertheless, judging from this longing and the subsequent disinfection, she was probably more concerned that Jasper would be uncomfortable due to his germophobia.

At this moment, Brentley noticed a detail in the scene. When Aurora watched the two children play, there seemed to be slight sorrow in her eyes.

But only a second after, she returned to staring fixedly at the boy by the sycamore tree, concerned about his germophobia.

""Sorrow?"" Brentley became tense.

""Had this woman learned how to pretend at such a young age?"" he wondered.

Had he not looked closely, he would not have noticed her true feelings concealed by her concern.

""Is Mr. Laberge verifying?"" Brentley wanted to see Jasper's reaction, but he did not have the courage.

All of Jasper's emotions were hidden behind the mask.

His eyes fixated for a few seconds on the lonely eyes of ten-year-old Aurora before eventually moving away.

The scene continued.

This was a happy time. Two ten-year-old children grew up carefreely in the vast manor.

What surprised everyone was that ten-year-old Aurora was cheerful, lively, and exceptionally adorable.

Jasper, on the other hand, was reticent and wore a straight face since he was young, but there was no lack of happiness in his life.

All of that was brought to him by Aurora.

The two climbed trees to catch birds, waded into rivers to fish, scaled walls to cause mischief, and also studied hard together.

They never quarreled and always played together.

Clearly, they were two innocent playmates!

The tiny Aurora always had a bright, lovely smile on her face.

The audience noticed that Jasper always looked fairly happier when he was with Aurora.

A doubt then appeared in everyone's mind.

""This can't be right. How could such a cheerful, energetic child become so scary in the future?""

""Aurora was practically a little sunshine when she was young. No matter how good she is at pretense, she can't possibly pretend that well when she was only ten years old.""

""Agreed. There was no darkness in these memories, and people's subconscious would not hide it on purpose.""

Right then, a psychologist who was present spoke up. ""We've assessed this memory professionally and concluded that her feelings were real, without any pretense. Also, these memories came from Aurora's parents and other servants from her childhood as well. All of them are genuine, valid, and without falsification.""

He continued, ""Additionally, we have just analyzed Aurora's memory and behavior. Based on what we've seen thus far, her heart is filled with positivity, and she has very little chance of turning evil in the future.""

Upon hearing this, everybody was astonished.

""Since memory won't go wrong, why did such a cheery girl become a witch in the future?""

""Are behavior predictions always accurate? Perhaps some evil is etched in the bones and will only erupt at a specific time.""

""Maybe significant changes happened later and caused her temperament to shift drastically.""

""But her childhood was so full of energy. Could a few incidents really cause such drastic changes in her temperament? She isn't just bad but sinful and more terrifying than typical murderers!""

""I reckon it could be related to the incident of the Laberge family. Thereafter, a tragedy happened to the Laberge family.""

While the audience discussed, the scene changed.

Aurora was 12 years old, and it was a hot, dry summer night without any breeze.

A small, black car discreetly drove in through the gate to the path lined with sycamore trees before stopping directly in front of the Laberge residence.

Four masked men in black got out of the vehicle, each holding a machete, and rushed into the mansion menacingly.

Soon, screams came from the residence.

The man and lady of the house were tied up and brought out by the criminals, both of them injured.

Meanwhile, the third man trailing behind carried a motionless little boy on his shoulder.

""Jasper! Don't hurt my son!"" The Laberge couple began to struggle violently.

Unfortunately, shortly after, they were knocked out by the criminals, dragged into the car, and taken away.

""Jasper!"" When the car passed by the guard post, Aurora ran out from inside.

""Aurora, don't go!"" A young couple ran after her and stopped her.

They were Aurora's parents, Fabian and Caroline.

""Let go of me! The bad guys took them. I'm going to save Jasper!""

Aurora struggled fiercely. At 12 years old, she had grown taller, but it was still difficult for her to break free from the strength of adults.

Suddenly, she lowered her head, bit Fabian's hand, and shouted, ""Dad, you're supposed to be the Laberge family's guard, yet you let the bad guys in! If you don't dare to save them, I will!""

At last, Aurora broke free from her parents' hands and rushed into the night without hesitation.

# Chapter 4 I Will Carry You Out

Aurora kept running in the streets at night.

She had called the police before while using the electronic watch Jasper gave her to locate him.

Thankfully, the police department acted swiftly and confronted the criminals.

However, Aurora disappeared.

Back then, the abduction happening to the Laberge family caused a sensation in Yrinas, and some details could still be found online.

Some netizens had already started searching for that year's case to supply additional information through internet.

\[This matter was determined to be a contract killing, and the mastermind hasn't been found yet.\]

\[In the police department's report on this case back then, they did mention that the Laberge family's guard's daughter was the one who called the police, but there was no further news about Aurora.\]

\[She clearly chased after them, but why did she disappear? Still, given how young she was, she could've been hiding out of fear.\]

\[The fact that those beasts could enter the Laberge residence so easily was not mentioned in the report back then. Doesn't that mean it was all because Fabian failed to guard the gate properly?\]

\[Yes, that car drove in so effortlessly! Could it be that Fabian conspired with the criminals and let them in?\]

\[Looks like we've found this beast's hereditary genes. With such cruel parents, it's no surprise their daughter grew up to be scum!\]

While everyone was speculating, a deafening boom sounded in the scene.

The mountain cabin where the Laberge family was confined had caught fire.

In the burning flames, a boy was fighting against an adult male.

The boy was so young, yet his moves were extremely aggressive. Despite knowing his strength could never compete with an adult's, he was not afraid.

He promptly swung a stool and struck the man, causing the latter to fall to the ground with a thud.

Sadly, he, too, collapsed from exhaustion.

The fire was getting increasingly bigger, and the thick smoke quickly submerged the surrounding area.

""It's Mr. Jasper Laberge!""

""How brave! A 12-year-old boy actually defeated a crook.""

""Geez! I can't believe Mr. Laberge was so impressive as a child. But he was also badly injured and had no strength left.""

""Mr. Laberge, wake up! The fire is approaching!""

Although the audience knew that Jasper was well and sitting in the private room, the sight of the large fire at the scene still unnerved them.

At the scene, the fire showed no signs of easing at all.

Pieces of wood from the beams fell one after another, and some even almost hit Jasper.

Time ticked away second by second.

Out of the blue, a tiny figure in the corner struggled to stand up while using the wall as support.

""Jasper...""

She staggered toward Jasper, carried him on her back, and headed for the door strenuously.

The smoke was so thick that it choked her, making her coughing incessantly.

""Is that Aurora?""

""So, she had long found Mr. Laberge. Did she fight the criminals earlier too?""

The fire drew the irritable audience's attention.

""According to the case, when Mr. Jasper Laberge was found, he was lying on the mountain road outside, and it was Christine who saved him.""

""Yes, that was what the record stated. Christine had run up the mountain and rescued Mr. Jasper Laberge in spite of her family's objection. But why are we seeing Aurora rush out of the fire with Mr. Laberge now instead?""

In the scene, Aurora abruptly halted in her tracks.

She carefully placed the unconscious Jasper on the ground and removed her coat to wrap around his mouth and nose.

""Jasper, don't be afraid. I'll definitely carry you out."" Then, she clenched her jaw, grunted, and piggybacked him once again.

As she was much smaller than Jasper in physique, it took her a lot of effort to carry him on her back.

In the meantime, the flames had spread over.

""Run... Quick... You fool..."" Jasper strained to open his eyes, raised his hand, and pulled her arm. ""Leave me behind...""

""No!"" Aurora wrapped her arms tightly around his body behind her back. ""I said I'd carry you out.""

Cough!

She had given Jasper her clothes to block the smoke, so the moment she opened her mouth to speak, she felt lightheaded from choking on the dense smoke.

Jasper extended a hand to cover Aurora's nose but immediately fell unconscious for a second time.

He was more severely injured than Aurora and had already depleted all his strength.

Boom!

Without warning, a burning beam of the cabin fell. While carrying Jasper on her back, Aurora somehow found the strength to dodge it.

Nevertheless, she stumbled.

The moment she fell, she used her frail body to cushion Jasper.

A loud thud could be heard as she bumped her head on the coffee table at the side. Her eyes then rolled to the back of her head, and she fainted in the next instant.

Yet, that was only for a brief moment. To everyone's surprise, she quickly regained consciousness!

""I can't fall! I can't fall down. I can't..."" Aurora said to herself firmly.

Aurora seemed to have infinite energy inside her petite body. She gritted her teeth and, once more, carried the unconscious Jasper on her back.

One step, two steps...

Each time she fell, she got to her feet, and this cycle kept on repeating.

By now, the thick smoke around them had engulfed everything, and nothing could be seen.

Even adults wouldn't be able to escape from such a large fire and dense smoke.

Yet, Aurora, a little girl, carrying a taller boy on her back, used all her might and brought him step by step to the light at the door.

Even though the flames burned her hair and eyelashes, she did not even make a sound.

She simply kept repeating unconsciously, ""Jasper, don't be afraid. I'll carry you out. I'll definitely carry you out.""

The studio fell into a dead silence.

Everyone stared intently at the screen while tightening their fists.

They thought, 'Why? You were so kind and brave back then. Why did you later become a witch?

Why in the world is that, Aurora Youngblood?'

The victims' families, who were present, trembled from head to toe while their eyes filled with tears.

They were all asking the same question in their hearts.

They thought angrily, 'Aurora, why did you become so cruel later?

You risked your life when you were 12 to save your friend. Even adults might not be as courageous as you. So, why on earth did you become a witch ten years later and wickedly harm those innocent children?

Why did you become a villain?'

It was precisely because Aurora was so courageous and touching back then that everyone found it difficult to accept her changing.

""She was clearly a diamond in the rough. Why did she later become so corrupted?"" ruminated the crowd.

A burst of sorrow and rage spread from everyone's heart and surged.

They wanted to rush into the screen, grab Aurora, and fiercely demand her to give them an explanation.

With a bang, the door of the cabin collapsed in the fire.

In the scene, Aurora finally made it out with Jasper on her back.

She didn't dare to stop or look back, though.

While piggybacking Jasper, Aurora lurched down the mountain like a robot.

Boom!

The cabin exploded behind Aurora.

Still, she didn't look back. Her small teeth bit her lip, drawing blood that quickly dried up and stuck to the corner of her mouth.

Gradually, the cabin faded away from sight.

Dogs were barking at the foot of the mountain, signaling that the rescuers had arrived.

Aurora climbed up a tall slope with Jasper on her back. When she saw the flashlights light up at the foot of the mountain, she strained to widen her eyes.

""Jasper, the rescuers are here.""

A smile appeared on her face. With that, she relaxed, and her legs went limp.

After putting Jasper on the ground, Aurora turned around and staggered into the deep mountains.

""Mr. Laberge... I must save Mr. Laberge!""

""What? She still had energy!""

""Where on earth did she get the determination to keep saving people even when she was nearly drained of energy herself?""

In the broadcast studio, the audience was feeling beyond conflicted.

They abominated this witch, Aurora.

Regardless, they could not hate the 12-year-old Aurora upon seeing her tiny figure heading deeper into the dark mountain amidst the raging fire.

All of a sudden, someone sighed faintly. ""Child, don't go. Your Mr. Laberge is already gone.""

It then went so silent in the studio that one could hear a pin drop.

# Chapter 5 What Do You Think Of Her

The criminals detained the three Laberges in three different places.

Jasper's father, Nick Laberge, trapped in the deepest part of the mountain, had long died before he was found.

Jasper was found by Christine and the search and rescue personnel on the mountain road.

As for Jasper's mother, Whitney Laberge, she was the first to be rescued but also covered with injuries after being tortured by the criminals.

In the scene, Aurora knelt before Nick's body. Albeit clumsy, she pressed his chest with her two small hands non-stop.

""Please don't die, Mr. Laberge! Wake up! What should Jasper do if you're dead? Don't die...""

""Young lady, he has been dead for hours. There's no way he can be saved."" The rescuers rushed in and pulled her away.

Abruptly, Aurora stopped and turned her head stiffly to look at the rescuers.

""Sir, you're lying to me, aren't you? You're lying..."" Tears rolled down her big eyes. ""It's not true... What should Jasper do? He has lost his father.""

""Young lady! Quick! She's gone into shock! Get the stretcher over here now!""

Aurora sank into a nightmare.

The scenes were messy and fragmented, filled with chaotic recollections.

There were fires, screams and cries, and the car that drove into the Laberge residence late at night.

Aurora kept chasing after that vehicle relentlessly.

Suddenly, the scene was interrupted, and the screen went dark.

In Private Room No. 9, Jasper pressed the blue button beside the couch, and his knuckle turned pale from the strength he exerted.

He closed his eyes and leaned against the couch, his lips pressing tightly. It was impossible to guess what he was thinking.

""Mr. Laberge, I'll ask them to change the content immediately,"" Brentley said hurriedly.

The Laberge family's tragedy that year had hurt Jasper deeply.

""Damn! Why did the studio broadcast these memories in this trial?"" pondered Brentley.

Jasper lowered his gaze and rubbed the rosary beads with his fingertips. ""This is her memory,"" he said in a low voice.

""Whose?"" Brentley was stunned.

It then immediately dawned on him that Jasper was talking about Aurora.

This memory of saving people belonged to Aurora.

""It's a memory that no one knows.""

Jasper dipped his head and inspected the rosary beads in his hand. His index finger swiped across the top half of the circle, and he buckled the eighth bead under his knuckle before gently tracing the ""A"" engraved on it.

Even he had only just learned how hard she had tried to save him at that time.

Jasper shut his eyes and recalled the scene that he just witnessed.

He had an incredibly rare dynamic memory, so his memory ability surpassed most people.

With his eyes closed now, he saw Aurora struggling to advance in the fire with him on her back, and every single detail of the scene replicated what was previously played.

There were fire, smoke, coughing, and that metal piece shattered from the fire, which struck Aurora's right calf and left a scar that could never heal.

All of a sudden, Jasper raised his head and looked at Brentley emotionlessly through the beast mask. ""Brentley, what do you think of her?""

""I..."" Brentley was struck dumb.

If they were only talking about the 12-year-old Aurora, he couldn't hate or dislike her. On the contrary, he'd even deeply admire her.

However, he thought of those evil acts she committed later and her act of stealing Laberge Group's trade secrets, causing the company to almost plunge into an irreparable situation.

""I'm sorry, Mr. Laberge. I can't forgive her."" Brentley voiced his thoughts honestly.

Indeed, Aurora used to be a good person, but that didn't mean it could offset what she did subsequently.

Such was how the world worked.

The law would never allow anyone to forget about her misdeeds either.

Brentley thought, 'Moreover, those memories just now should have reminded Mr. Laberge of his painful childhood memories, right?

But why is he asking about Aurora instead?'

Brentley looked at his boss apprehensively, unable to figure out what the latter was thinking.

Everyone believed that Jasper loathed Aurora.

However, Jasper had never explicitly said that before.

Sometime later, Jasper released the button and said flatly, ""No need to change it.""

Brentley's heart skipped a beat.

""Mr. Laberge chose this memory?"" he mused.

With that, the screen lit up again.

Clips of other people's memories of the Laberge family tragedy started playing.

In that incident, one of the Laberge family members died and two were injured, whereas all four criminals died on the spot.

As the real mastermind was on the run, the case went cold.

Christine stayed by Jasper's bed all the time.

In Private Room No. 1, Christine looked at the screen in a daze. ""So, it was you.""

A tear drop slipped from the corner of her eye.

She quickly wiped it away and smiled at the camera. ""It was said that I saved Jas, but the cabin had actually been destroyed when we found him. I didn't know until today that Aurora had done so much back then."" Her eyes brightened. ""This is you, Aurora Youngblood. You've always, always been so kind."" She looked at the camera and flashed a relieved grin. ""Everyone saw that, right? She's so brave, strong, and kind.""

""Christine, you still trust her so much."" Hannah was rather lost for words.

In the live room, fans were exceptionally heartbroken when they heard Christine's words.

\[Christine has always believed that Witch is innocent. She must be especially moved to see what Aurora did just now.\]

\[I'm distressed when I see Lady Christine cry too. It's undeniable that the 12-year-old Aurora is admirable. However, it can never erase those crimes she later committed!\]

\[I think I know why Christine still believes in Aurora even now. After all, Aurora was indeed really kind as a child. That's why Christine doesn't want to believe Aurora would become so vicious.\]

\[Wake up, Christine. She's just pretending!\]

In the broadcast studio, the criminal psychologists and pedagogy experts heard Christine's words and expressed their opinions.

The audience was in a conflicted mood.

Abruptly, someone questioned, ""Why wasn't that despicable couple who allowed the criminals into the Laberge residence punished?""",1,1753699211.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

Whatever happened in the past three years, bury it and forget it, got it? Don't think being the daughter of duke's estate means someone's going to back you up!""

""There never was anyone before, and there sure won't be in the future."" Athena Monson's face was expressionless, her voice hollow. She nodded meekly, not daring to defy the steward.

Leaning against the wall for support, she slowly made her way out of the camp.

She had once lit up Pidence City with her dazzling dance. Now her knees, ruined from years of injury, could barely hold her weight. Without medicine, even her skill in healing was useless.

Just outside the camp, she heard someone call her name. Flinching, she lifted her head hesitantly.

What met her eyes was a majestic steed, a royal gift, and astride it sat the Marquis of Somers—Michael Osborne. The famed war god himself.

He sat tall and poised, broad shoulders tapering to a lean waist, his face strikingly handsome. He still carried that same air of noble elegance.

This was the man she had loved for three long years. She had seen this scene in her dreams countless times—him finally coming to take her home.

Her eyes filled with tears, and she opened her mouth to speak, but no words came.

Because it was him—he was the one who had thrown her into this hellish camp, ordering others to ""teach her a lesson.""

The cold indifference in his eyes made her already shattered heart tremble again.

""I can take you home,"" Michael said, looking down at her from his horse, eyes like ice, his tone as sharp as a blade. ""But tell me—do you finally admit you were wrong?

""If you hadn't poisoned the pastries back then, Willow wouldn't be living with a chronic illness. She still needs daily medicine. You only suffered three years of punishment—she'll suffer for the rest of her life. You owe her forever!""

When Athena remained silent, Michael snapped, ""Answer me! Do you admit your guilt?""

The sudden sharpness in his voice made her jump. Reflexively, she shut her eyes, wrapped her arms around her head, and crouched down, crying out, ""I admit it! I was wrong! I'll never do it again!""

But the lash she expected never came. Only then did she remember—he was the Marquis of Somers. A man like him would never lower himself to beat someone like her.

Still, she truly had been wrong. She was wrong to care. Wrong to love. Wrong to give her heart to people who treated it like nothing.

When she'd first been thrown into the camp, she still clung to a shred of hope.

She had thought, 'My fiancé can't really be that heartless. He has protected me since our engagement—risking his life, even, to spare me from harm.

'And my parents in the duke's estate—surely, they would come for me. I have been framed.'

But she waited. And waited. And what came instead was nothing but torment—merciless, day after day, at the hands of the soldiers.

She was a noblewoman, not a camp whore. They didn't dare touch her, which only made them more creative in how they broke her.

Sometimes, they beat her with slender whips made specifically for disciplining women—tools that cut deep and left her flesh in tatters. Other times, they stripped her naked and tossed her into the snow.

They were waiting for her to beg. To give in. To offer her body in exchange for a bite of food or a few days of peace.

But she never did. So their torment grew nastier, more degrading, every time.

Eventually, she stopped fighting back—not out of obedience, but because she no longer had the strength to resist.

""Athena, what game are you playing now?"" Michael frowned, his tone sharp with disdain.

He wondered, 'Three years of discipline, and she's ended up this pathetic?'

The once-glowing beauty of her face was gone—now it was sickly pale and hollow. Her waist, once soft and full, had thinned so much it looked like it might snap under a strong breeze.

He thought, 'Trying to act pitiful? I am not falling for it. I personally ordered my men to take good care of her. There is no way she's truly been mistreated.'

Turning away, Michael dismounted. He reached out a hand toward her. ""Get in the carriage.""

But she recoiled like a wounded animal, clutching her head, eyes blank, voice trembling as she pleaded, ""No… please don't… don't touch me…""

""That's enough,"" he snapped. ""Still pretending to be pitiful?""

His voice turned colder. ""What, is this your way of making me feel guilty?""

Athena slowly came back to herself. Her voice was dry, hoarse. She gave a hollow laugh, laced with self-mockery.

In front of Michael—or her parents—she had never once had the right to feel wronged.

If they'd ever truly felt guilty, they wouldn't have waited until now.

Thirteen years ago, her birth parents finally brought her home to the duke's estate. That was when she found out the truth—she'd been swapped at birth.

The greedy couple who raised her had traded her away and left her to suffer five bitter years.

She'd thought that returning to her real family meant love and acceptance. But what she got instead was coldness.

Her parents and brothers barely looked at her.

Whenever Willow Monson—the girl who'd lived her life—felt sad or neglected, they rushed to comfort her, as if she were the real daughter.

Little by little, Athena was pushed aside.

They constantly reminded her, ""You're the older sister. You should be the mature one. Be patient with Willow. Don't fight. Don't compete.""

Wanting so desperately to belong, Athena did as she was told. She gave way in everything, always stepping aside for Willow.

Three years ago, she even made pastries by hand to try to please her.

But Willow ended up poisoned—vomiting blood.

Their parents were furious. They said Athena's years away had corrupted her to the bone. Said she wasn't worthy of being their daughter.

Egged on by Willow's whispers, they decided to send her away—banished from Pidence City forever.

Even the brothers who once adored her said, ""Willow might've enjoyed your life for over a decade, but she's innocent. How could you use such cruel tactics just to win attention? We don't have a sister as heartless as you!""

No matter how Athena tried to explain, no one believed her. Not once.

The moment Willow shed a tear, the blame fell on Athena.

In the end, it was Michael who stepped in to stop them from sending her away.

But he didn't save her. He simply had her quietly dumped in the military camp—believing that after enough suffering, she'd finally learn her place.

A gust of wind lifted the tangled strands of Athena's hair, revealing her emaciated, unrecognizable face.

Michael scowled. ""Get up. We're going back to the estate.""

Athena tried, but her legs gave out beneath her, and she crumpled to the ground again.

Michael turned back, his eyes flashing cold steel. ""If you'd rather not go back… then drag yourself back into that camp.""

# 2.Chapter 2 Realize Your Mistake?

Athena lowered her gaze, gritted her teeth, and forced herself to stand. She didn't say a word as she clumsily climbed into the carriage, using both hands and knees.

Her legs throbbed with pain, barely able to hold her, and she looked completely wretched.

Michael turned away, refusing to watch. He had assumed three years of punishment would be enough to wear down her spirit, but the moment they met again, she was already trying to play the victim—putting on a show to win his sympathy.

If it hadn't been for that person's orders, he wouldn't have come for her at all.

What baffled him was why someone of such high rank would even notice Athena—let alone give an order about her the moment he returned to Pidence City.

Michael was the first to get out of the carriage. Without a glance back, he instructed his men, ""I have business back at camp. After you drop her off, get rid of the carriage—I don't want to see it again. It's filthy.""

Filthy. The word hit her like a slap. Athena's chest ached with a dull, sinking pain. She sniffed quietly, face devoid of emotion, and stepped down from the carriage.

Outside the towering red gates of the duke's estate, a woman was already waiting. The moment she saw Athena, she rushed over, eyes full of urgency.

But the first thing she said was, ""My sweet daughter, it's been three years. Have you finally realized your mistake?""

""I have,"" Athena replied flatly.

Her mistake had been wanting love too much. This time, she would sever those ties—for good. Just… not yet. Not while Margaret Monson, her grandmother, still needed her care.

Eloise Monson looked at Athena, her daughter—so thin and pale, her eyes distant—and her expression faltered.

Three years of hardship had changed Athena completely. Just one look was enough to make her heart ache.

No matter how deeply Athena had erred, she was still her daughter—still her flesh and blood. And she had clearly paid the price.

""It's good you understand now,"" Eloise said softly. ""You mustn't be so willful again. Come on, get up."" She reached out to help.

But Athena immediately stood up on her own and took a step back, putting distance between them. Her eyes were guarded, cautious.

Eloise's heart twisted. ""You blame me for being too harsh? But I did it for your own good—for your future! What mother doesn't want the best for her child?""

Her eyes turned red, her voice trembling with a hint of tears. ""Don't hold it against me…""

Her face was full of sorrow, as though she were the one who'd suffered for three years.

Athena stood there, unmoved, making no effort to bridge the gap between them.

Just then, a slender figure stepped gracefully out of the manor and gently supported Eloise's arm.

""Mother, Athena's just come home. She's probably overwhelmed. Don't be upset if she seems distant—give her a little time, all right?""

The girl was delicate and fair, with porcelain skin and a sweet, innocent smile.

She turned to Athena and extended her hand, her eyes wide with sincerity. ""Athena, I don't hold anything against you. Let's forget the past, okay? We're still family—we should love each other, just like before.""

Her smile was as gentle and harmless as ever.

Athena almost laughed out loud. After everything she'd endured, she wondered, 'Do they really think a few nice words can just wipe it all away?'

""Love? Between you and me?"" Disgust flickered in her eyes.

That was when someone finally lost patience.

""Willow's already gone out of her way to be kind to you, and you're still acting like this? What's wrong with your attitude?""

Nicolas Monson had just come from court, still in his crimson official robes. He swung off his horse and walked over, clearly irritated.

""You think you're the only one who's suffered these past three years? Do you have any idea what Mother's been through? She's lost sleep night after night, her hair's turning white!

""If it weren't for Willow taking care of her and fulfilling your duties, who knows what would've happened?""

Nicolas had seen the whole scene earlier—Eloise's joy quickly deflated, Willow's soft voice met with Athena's cold rejection.

Nicolas thought, 'And all because of three years of punishment? What right does she have to act wronged? Willow almost died.'

Eloise frowned at Nicolas, her son, clearly disapproving. ""Don't exaggerate. She just got back. As her big brother, you should be gentler with her. Don't scare her.""

""Mother, you don't need to defend her. The Monson family owes her nothing. She's the one who made the mistake. And because of her, our entire household's reputation suffered.

""Everyone in Pidence City knows the Duke's family raised a vicious, manipulative girl. And Willow? She never complained—she's done everything she could to protect this family.""

Nicolas still hadn't calmed down.

""Athena! Willow even covered for you—she told everyone you never poisoned her, just to protect your name. Shouldn't you be grateful?"" he continued.

When Athena said nothing, his voice rose sharply. ""Say something! Are you mute now?""

Athena blinked, struggling to hold back the sting in her eyes.

Once upon a time, Nicolas had been different. Unlike her second and third brothers, he had been the one who truly cared for her.

He once told her he'd split the love he gave Willow and give half to her—and for a while, he meant it.

When the servants looked down on her, he gave out thirty lashes on her behalf. On her birthday, he carved a jewel pendant for her by hand. When she was sick, he stayed by her side through the night.

But all that kindness vanished the moment Willow acted hurt.

Love that could be so easily withdrawn—that kind of love, she no longer wanted.

The air between them turned stiff with silence.

Eloise quickly stepped in to smooth things over. ""What's done is done. Let's go inside—your father and grandmother are still waiting.""

Nicolas scoffed and gave a dismissive wave of his sleeve as he turned toward the estate.

After a few steps, he looked back, his voice suddenly soft. ""Willow, come here.""

""Yes, Nicolas."" She smiled sweetly, casting a glance at Athena. She said nothing—but somehow, it said everything.

Athena was used to it by now. She had always been the outsider in this family.

She had already made up her mind: she would let go. Let Willow have all of it—Michael, her parents, her brothers.

But even with that resolve, watching this unfold still made her throat tighten and her eyes sting.

# 3.Chapter 3 Oversized Clothes

Eloise led Athena through the gates of the estate, turning to the servants as they entered. ""Take Lady Athena to wash up first. After that, she'll go pay her respects to Lady Margaret.""

Then she looked at Athena with a gentle smile. ""Your grandmother's getting on in years. Her health hasn't been great—she's been relying on herbal tonics these past few years. When you see her, be sweet and respectful, and don't bring up anything about the last three years. It'll only upset her.""

Athena nodded quietly.

Margaret had always been the most fair-minded person in the family—but she was too old now to involve herself in household affairs.

Seeing Athena accept her words without protest, Eloise finally relaxed a little.

She continued, testing the waters, ""You're eighteen now—of marriageable age. What happened in the camp... let's not mention it again. If word gets out that you spent the last three years living among soldiers, day and night, people will start talking.

""That kind of gossip could ruin your chances of a good match. I've already come up with an explanation. We'll say you were away recuperating, and now you've just returned.""

Athena's face remained calm. She gave a soft ""Yes,"" then followed the maid assigned to her.

But after a few turns, she realized something was wrong. This wasn't the way to her old courtyard.

She asked, and the maid smiled brightly as she explained, ""Lady Willow has been in poor health for years. The doctor said the trees in your courtyard were too damp and affected her health. So they were all cut down.

""To help her recover, they leveled your courtyard and merged it with hers. They even diverted hot spring water to the new space for her treatment. But don't worry, Lady Eloise had this new courtyard cleaned and prepared for you before your return.""

The maid said it as if it were completely normal, perfectly reasonable.

As if everyone had conveniently forgotten that Athena was the true daughter of the house—while Willow was merely adopted.

The maid led Athena to a small, modest courtyard and pushed the door open. ""You'll be staying here from now on, Lady Athena.""

The space was much smaller than her original quarters, and with no greenery in sight, it looked bare and lifeless.

Two unfamiliar maids stepped forward and bowed. ""Lady Athena.""

Athena didn't recognize either of them. After three years away, most of the household staff had changed.

One had a round face, the other an oval one. Both were attractive and sharp-eyed—clearly selected for looks and cleverness.

""I'm Siena Hotham.""

""I'm Aliza Crofton.""

Together, they echoed, ""Hi, Lady Athena.""

Athena gave a small nod and motioned for them to rise.

Then she asked, ""Where are Thalia and Macy?""

Those had been her personal maids before she was sent away. But once she entered the military camp, all news of them vanished.

The maid smiled and replied, ""Not long after you left, they both got married. I imagine they're living quiet, peaceful lives now—looking after their husbands and raising children.""

Athena nodded. A peaceful life sounded good. Far better than serving others for the rest of your days.

The thought brought a faint sense of ease. She stepped inside.

The table was already set. The meal was generous—four dishes and a soup—but the plates were no bigger than a clenched fist.

She began to eat. One plate of pasta disappeared in just a few bites.

Her brows knit slightly. ""Is there more?""

Siena looked momentarily stunned, then quickly nodded. ""Yes, of course, I'll get it right away.""

Watching her eat so fast, Aliza spoke up gently, ""Lady Athena, please slow down. You'll upset your stomach if you rush like that.""

Athena's fork paused in mid-air. She had nearly forgotten—this wasn't the military camp anymore.

This was the duke's estate. No one here was going to snatch her food. No one would dump kitchen slop onto her plate.

The pasta was fragrant. The dishes were fresh. And the meat—it was real bacon. Not rat. Not snake.

Siena returned with two more plates of pasta.

Athena ate quickly and without grace. There was nothing delicate or refined in her manners—she looked more like a starving beggar than a noble daughter.

Siena opened her mouth several times to speak but held her tongue each time.

After the meal, the servants had already prepared hot water for her bath. Siena and Aliza followed her in. ""Lady Athena, allow us to help you bathe,"" Siena offered politely.

""That won't be necessary. You can leave."" Athena said.

Siena hesitated, clearly unsure.

Aliza added with concern, ""If Lady Eloise finds out, she'll punish us for not serving you properly…""

Athena didn't speak. She simply looked at them—calm, expressionless.

There was no anger in her eyes, no emotion at all. But the chill behind that blank gaze made both girls shiver.

Without another word, they backed out of the room and quietly closed the door behind them.

Only then did Athena step behind the screen and begin undressing.

Her body was gaunt, skin stretched tightly over bone. Her once-fair skin was now covered in bruises—some new, others long faded.

If she hadn't known medicine, she would have died in that place.

After washing, she reached for the fresh clothes laid out on the rack. The fabric was fine—soft, warm, and tailored to fit.

But on her starved frame, the robe hung loose and shapeless, making her look more like a walking skeleton than a noble daughter.

""Lady Athena, Lady Eloise and the Lady Margaret are waiting,"" Aliza reminded her from outside.

Athena nodded and made her way toward Starling House.

In just three years, the duke's estate had changed so much.

She paused at the edge of the pond, lost in thought. ""What happened to the lotuses?"" she asked.

""Lady Willow said there were too many mosquitoes in summer,"" Aliza replied. ""So Lord Nicolas had them all removed.""

Athena thought, 'Of course. Willow—again.' Athena felt a familiar ache in her chest.

When she had first arrived at the estate, she tried so hard to win everyone over.

She had planted those lotuses herself, hoping to make wine from the blossoms and gift it to Nicolas.

He had laughed at her back then. ""You're my sister. There's no need for all that. But if it makes you happy, I'll help you plant them.""

The proud, aloof heir of the house had actually gotten his hands dirty—for her.

At the time, Athena had thought, 'So this is what it feels like to be cherished.'

But now… it was clear. Whatever kindness they'd shown her didn't come close to how they treated Willow. Not even a tenth of it.

She arrived at Margaret's quarters. The room was already full.

Eloise looked toward the door—and frowned. She wondered, 'Why does the robe look so oversized on Athena?'

# 4.Chapter 4 The One To Blame

Before Athena could say a word, Nicolas stepped forward, blocking Margaret's view.

""Athena! Are you doing this on purpose?"" he snapped. ""Three years weren't enough to teach you some manners? Still playing your little games? You've really let me down!""

""I told you to present yourself properly. What are you wearing?"" His expression was full of disapproval, his tone unconsciously laced with the stern authority of a Justice Ministry official.

He looked at her like she was standing trial. ""If you've got complaints, direct them at me. Why come here and put on a show in front of Grandmother? Are you trying to make her feel sorry for you? Do you want to upset her so badly she falls ill?""

Athena almost laughed out loud.

She raised an eyebrow, her smile cool and detached. ""The clothes? Lady Eloise picked them out. What did you expect me to wear—what I came back in from the military camp?""

That shut him up. For a moment, Nicolas was at a loss. She had called Eloise ""Lady Eloise""—not ""Mother.""

Only then did it hit him: ever since Athena returned, she hadn't regarded him as brother once either.

A flicker of unease crept into his chest. The harsh words caught in his throat and never made it out.

His gaze narrowed, a thought nagging at the back of his mind. 'It's only been three years… how did she waste away like this?'

Eloise quickly stepped in to smooth things over. ""That was my oversight. Don't be too hard on Athena.""

Nicolas stepped aside, allowing Athena to enter.

Margaret's eyes lit up the moment she saw her.

""Come here, come,"" she called, voice trembling slightly. ""Let me take a good look at you.""

That warmth, that longing in her eyes—Athena felt her nose sting. She stepped forward and let Margaret take her hands and look her over from head to toe.

""How did you get so thin?"" Margaret pulled her into a hug, holding her tightly, voice choked with emotion. ""My sweet girl… you've suffered. It's all my fault. I'm too old, too useless… I couldn't protect you…""

Athena knew how things had gone. Back then, Margaret had stood by her, even if it meant alienating the rest of the family. Her health had already been fragile.

The fact she'd made it through these years at all was a miracle. If not for the empire's strict laws, no one knew what would've happened…

She wrapped her arms around Margaret, and whispered through a tight throat, ""Grandmother.""

Just one word—and Margaret broke down completely, tears streaming down her face.

Off to the side, Eloise watched the reunion, a pang of bitterness tightening in her chest.

Athena had been home for some time now… and still hadn't called her ""Mother.""

She dabbed at her eyes with a silk handkerchief, playing the part of the grieving parent.

Willow stepped up, gently hugging her. ""Don't be sad, Mother. Athena's home now."" Her voice was soft, comforting, obedient.

Eloise looked down at her beloved Willow and felt deeply comforted.

She nodded, eyes still wet, but a faint smile tugging at her lips. She thought, 'At least Willow understands.'

But just as she started to feel at ease, that smile froze.

Margaret's voice, quivering and confused, rang out, ""What's going on?""

Athena's once delicate fingers were now covered in scars—blackened bruises and jagged welts. When she lifted her sleeve, old knife wounds and fresh burns marred the skin along her arms.

Margaret's gaze faltered. She couldn't bear to look any longer. ""She was sent to do labor… how did she end up like this?""

Eloise looked genuinely shocked. ""These injuries—how did they happen?""

Surrounded by concerned faces, Athena buried the emptiness in her eyes and replied softly, ""They came from the overseers at the camp, of course…""

Gasps rippled through the room. Athena's lips curled into a faint, mocking smile. ""I was there to work, not to be treated like a young lady. Getting beaten was just part of the routine.""

She didn't say more. Even recalling it made her stomach turn.

But her few words had already shaken everyone to the core. They thought, 'Beaten—for three full years. How has she even survived?'

Margaret's hands trembled as she clutched Athena's. ""How could they? How dare they? You're the duke's daughter! That camp was under your fiancé's command—how could anyone there lay a finger on you?""

Athena's smile grew, cold and biting. ""Because someone gave the order.""

Nicolas's face turned red with fury. ""You really are useless. You let them beat you like that and didn't even fight back?""

Athena's voice stayed flat, almost detached. ""Do you think a place like that gave me the right to speak, let alone resist? Being quiet and obedient meant fewer beatings. That's the reality.""

She looked directly at him, that faint smile still on her lips. ""Isn't that what you wanted, Lord Nicolas? For me to behave? To finally be 'taught a lesson'? Well, I've learned it. I'm quiet now. Isn't that what makes you happy?""

Nicolas stared at her in silence.

She was smiling, yes—but it never reached her eyes. She hadn't said a single word of accusation, yet the guilt hit him like a knife to the chest.

His expression began to soften, just as he opened his mouth to speak—when Willow's voice suddenly broke in.

""This is all my fault. I'm the one who should be blamed. If my body weren't so weak—if I hadn't reacted badly to the medicine—Athena never would've been punished.

""I was never meant to belong to this family anyway. Maybe… maybe I should go live in the countryside with my birth parents…""

She dissolved into sobs, her voice quivering with each breath. Tears streamed freely down her face, as if she were the one who had suffered.

Immediately, Eloise rushed to her side, flustered, gently stroking her back. ""There, don't cry, darling. You'll make yourself sick.""

Nicolas jumped in too, alarmed. ""You know how fragile your health is—what are you doing, crying like this? If I'd known, I never would've let you come. Now look what's happened.""

Then he turned, casting a sharp look at Athena. As if to say, ""Why do you have to show those wounds? Now Grandmother is heartbroken, Willow is in tears, and Mother is riddled with guilt.""

Before long, everyone in the room was fussing over Willow—offering her coffee, passing her medicine, soothing her with kind words.

And Athena? She stood there alone, forgotten, as if she were nothing more than a bystander.

But of course… she wasn't a bystander. She was the cause. The reason for their guilt, their worry, their pain. The one to blame.

# 5.Chapter 5 Should Leave You There

Just then, the Duke of Suffield—Henry Monson—walked into the room.

His commanding gaze swept over everyone before lingering for a moment on Athena. Then, turning to Margaret, he bowed respectfully. ""Mother.""

Margaret quickly waved him up. ""No need for that, get up.""

After he rose, Nicolas and Willow both greeted him warmly. ""Father.""

Only Athena, calm and detached, said, ""Duke of Suffield.""

That one phrase froze the air in the room.

Henry frowned, as if he hadn't heard her right. ""What did you call me?""

A hint of anger crept into his expression.

Athena lowered her eyes and repeated softly, ""Duke of Suffield.""

Smack! The sound of the slap echoed through the hall as Athena's head snapped to the side.

""You ungrateful thing. Three years in the camp, and you still haven't learned a single ounce of humility?"" he roared.

He continued, ""Calling me 'Duke of Suffield'—what, you trying to cut ties with the family? If you still don't know your place, go back to the military camp and stay there! We don't need a disgrace like you in this household!""

Eloise rushed forward, throwing her arms around Athena protectively. ""Enough! If you have to hit someone, then hit me!""

Margaret rose to her feet, trembling with fury, and lifted her cane to strike Henry.

Tears streamed down her face as she shouted, ""Do you have any idea what she's been through these past three years? And now, right in front of me, you hit her? You might as well be hitting me!""

She had only just started to mend Athena's wounded heart. And now, with a single slap, he'd torn it wide open again. He was her father. Her biological father.

Margaret tried to fight for her—but her cane never landed. The moment she raised it, servants rushed in and stopped her. She didn't even touch his robes.

Athena stood silently off to the side, watching the chaos unfold, her expression cold and unreadable.

She thought, 'So this is the family that promises never to hurt me again. How absurd.'

Eloise turned in a panic to check Athena's face—but before she could, a sudden cry rang out. It was Willow.

Everyone turned. A thin trail of blood was trickling from her temple.

The room fell dead silent.

Henry's face twisted in alarm as he called out, ""Quick! Call the physician!""

Nicolas's eyes were red, his brows deeply furrowed. He looked like he'd rather have taken the injury himself. He said, ""Why would you rush in like that? What if it scars? She can handle it—she's used to it. But you? You're delicate. You shouldn't be hurt like this…""

Willow's voice was soft and trembling, her eyes filled with tears that clung to her lashes. ""I was just scared Father might get hurt… I didn't even think. I just moved.""

When Willow spoke, Henry's heart ached even more.

Everyone in the room hovered around Willow, fussing over her.

Meanwhile, Athena stood quietly to the side, her cheek visibly swollen—yet no one paid her any attention.

She said nothing. A flicker of cold amusement passed through her eyes.

When Henry slapped her, Eloise didn't even flinch.

But the moment Willow was accidentally hurt, that same ""mother"" had panicked like her life depended on it.

Anyone watching would've thought Willow was her real daughter.

Henry, still full of concern, didn't forget to glare at Athena.

He said, ""If it weren't for you, none of this would've happened. Honestly, we never should've brought you back thirteen years ago. Should've left you where you were.""

Nicolas also gave her a disapproving look—but when he saw the bruise on her face, he hesitated, and swallowed his words.

""Enough. That's enough. All of you, out,"" Margaret said with a headache brewing behind her temples.

""Yes,"" the others responded, withdrawing.

Margaret gently took Athena's hand and began applying medicine to her swollen cheek herself.

She said, ""Athena, don't hold it against your father. He's got a temper. But from now on, I won't let anyone hurt you again.""

Looking into Margaret's loving, weathered eyes, Athena couldn't bring herself to say the sharp words that had been sitting on the tip of her tongue.

""Of course not,"" she replied, forcing a quiet smile.

Margaret sighed. She wanted to say more, but fatigue overtook her. She waved Athena off to rest. ""We'll talk later.""

After helping Margaret lie down, Athena finally returned to her courtyard.

She had barely sat down when a familiar voice called from outside. ""Athena, are you asleep?""

Irritation flickered across Athena's face. She signaled for Siena to open the door.

Eloise stepped inside. Her gaze landed immediately on Athena's swollen cheek. She walked over, her voice gentle. ""Does it still hurt?""

Athena stared at her, silent, as if asking a question without words.

Eloise quickly realized how foolish her concern must have sounded. She hurried to continue, ""Athena, I brought you some wound medicine from Harmony Apothecary. This one's made by a famous physician—it's the best.

""The healer's been missing for three years now. His medicine is nearly impossible to find. Use it sparingly—it'll fade your bruises in less than a month.""

She reached out, tucking a loose strand of Athena's hair behind her ear. ""Athena, I've let you down. I didn't protect you when you needed it. If you're angry, blame me. Just… don't take it out on anyone else.

""From now on, I'll treat you right. I promise.""

She pressed the medicine jar into Athena's hand. Athena opened it—and saw right away that it was half empty.

She knew this medicine. She was the one who produced it. She knew exactly how much was supposed to be in a full jar.

Of course. It had been used already. Passed down to her only after someone else didn't need it anymore.

Eloise noticed her silence and felt a sting of disappointment.

Athena hadn't always been like this. She used to smile at everything she was given. Used to sweetly call her ""Mother,"" like it meant something.

Now, she was distant. Cold. A stranger.

'Willow would never act like this,' she thought. 'That child is so thoughtful, so gentle.'

""Well, I'll let you rest. I'll stop by again tomorrow,"" Eloise said.

Athena stood. ""Take care, Lady Eloise.""",2,1753698965.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False
1mbcolh,https://www.reddit.com/r/HonestBuyerReviews/comments/1mbcolh/haier_596l_sidebyside_refrigerator_review_worth/,Haier 596L Side-by-Side Refrigerator Review — Worth the Splurge or Overhyped?,"I don’t usually get excited about refrigerators, but this *Haier 596L beast* genuinely made me feel like I’m living in a Pinterest kitchen.

I’ve been using this model — [Haier HES-690SS-P](https://www.amazon.in/Haier-Inverter-Refrigerator-HES-690SS-P-Convertible/dp/B0BZ12FPM1?tag=rahulbhatia-21) — for about **3 months now**, and here’s my brutally honest take on it.

# What I LOVED:

**1. 100% Convertible = Genius**

This was the clincher. You can convert the freezer section into a fridge if you want. No unnecessary frozen peas building up in the corner.  You can turn either into a fridge when you don’t need to freeze stuff .... genius for veggie-dominant homes.

# 2. Storage That Makes Sense

You get **adjustable shelves**, a dedicated **wine rack**, deep **door bins** that hold 2L bottles easily, and **freezer racks** that don't waste space.

My favorite? The **multi-box** drawer for onions, garlic, and lemons that’s odor-controlled and neatly hidden.

3. **Quiet Yet Powerful**

You’ll barely know it’s on. Thanks to the Expert Inverter Compressor, the cooling adapts to how full the fridge is ... meaning it works smarter, not harder.  
Result? Lower bills. Steady cooling. No weird buzzing sounds.

4. **Frost-Free + Maintenance-Free**

Honestly, after switching from a manual-defrost fridge, this felt like the biggest upgrade.  
Zero ice buildup.  
No soggy food.  
No ""Oops, forgot to defrost"" mornings.

I haven’t had to defrost or deal with ice build-ups AT ALL. Set the temp, forget about it, live your life.

5. **It’s Sleek AF**

Let’s not pretend looks don’t matter. This fridge makes your kitchen look expensive. The **Shiny Silver finish** is honestly showroom-level classy. It doesn’t scream “Look at me!” but still gets compliments. Plus, the touch panel outside? Chef’s kiss.

# What’s NOT perfect:

* **No water/ice dispenser** — If you’re specifically looking for that, you’ll be disappointed. But if you're okay filling bottles yourself (like I am), this isn’t a deal-breaker.
* **Needs wide space** — It’s a side-by-side, so it needs breathing room. Don’t buy if your kitchen’s super narrow.

# PRICE RANGE:

It usually hovers between **₹58,000 – ₹62,000** on Amazon depending on offers. For the size and features, **it’s a solid bang for your buck** compared to Samsung or LG which shoot above ₹70K for similar features.

# Final Verdict:

If you're:

* A family of 4+ tired of cramming food into your old fridge
* Someone who needs better food organization and capacity
* Looking for luxury-level features without luxury prices

**Should You Buy It?**

Yes, if you want premium without the premium price tag.  
No, if your kitchen can’t handle the size.

In my opinion, GO FOR IT.  
It’s elegant, huge, functional, and genuinely future-ready.  
You’ll thank yourself every time you open it.

# Don’t Just Take My Word For It…

Prices fluctuate, so if it’s under ₹60K today ... you’re getting a solid deal.

The **Haier 190 L 5 Star Direct Cool Single Door Refrigerator** might just be your low-key MVP.  
👉 [Check the latest price on Amazon here](https://www.amazon.in/Haier-Direct-Refrigerator-HRD-2203BS-Brushline/dp/B08KH7VF4Q/ref=sr_1_6?tag=rahulbhatia-21)

After digging through specs, reviews, and user opinions, here’s a full breakdown of this little beast ... without the jargon or the salesy fluff.

# Quick Specs at a Glance:

* **Model**: HED-205DS-P (Dazzle Steel finish)
* **Capacity**: 190 Litres (suitable for 1–3 people)
* **Energy Rating**: 5 Star  (big savings on electricity bills)
* **Cooling Tech**: Direct Cool with *1-Hour Icing Technology*
* **Compressor**: Standard with stabilizer-free operation
* **Defrost Type**: Manual
* **Shelf Type**: Toughened glass
* **Price Range**: ₹15,000–₹17,000 (fluctuates during sales)

# What’s Actually Good:

**1. Power Saver Alert 🚨**  
The **5-star rating** is not just a sticker flex .... it means *real savings*. If you’re tired of inflated electricity bills, this fridge pays for itself over time.

**2. 1-Hour Icing? Kinda Legit.**  
Haier’s *1-Hour Icing Tech* actually works. Most users reported super quick freezing .... perfect if you're the impulsive ice-cream hoarder or chai needs ice stat.

**3. Dazzle Steel Looks Premium IRL**  
Let’s be honest, nobody wants a fridge that looks like a relic from 1995. This one? Sleek. Minimal. The “Dazzle Steel” finish makes it look more expensive than it is.

**4. Space Usage Is Smart**  
Even with a small-ish 190L capacity, the layout feels well thought-out. 2 large shelves, a veggie crisper that can fit a LOT of bhindi and broccoli, and a full-width freezer.

**5. Zero Voltage Hassles**  
It runs without a stabilizer in voltage fluctuation zones ... that’s one less thing to worry about, especially in Indian homes.

# What Could Be Better:

* **Manual Defrost** – Not a dealbreaker, but yes, you’ll need to defrost it yourself. No magic button.
* **Basic Compressor** – No inverter tech here. It's efficient, but not whisper-quiet. You might hear the occasional hum.
* **Freezer Space Isn’t Huge** – It’s enough for ice trays and frozen peas, but not ideal for bulk freezer stashing.

# Final Thoughts – Who Should Buy This?

If you're a small family, bachelor, or even looking for a second fridge for your WFH room or rented place ... **this Haier 190L model is solid**.

It’s **energy-efficient**, cools *fast*, and looks surprisingly premium ... all under ₹17K.  
If you're okay with a little manual defrosting, this one punches well above its weight.

All of these were found in thrift stores/ garage sales in-and-around the Portland OR area. Just sharing my fun assortment of shiny things.

First, from “TC SuperThrift”, I got a WS George bowl with a super-spicy uranium glaze ($2) and a Westmoreland milk glass compote bowl with the authentication sticker still on ($3)!

Then at the cash-only thrift on 99E, a chrome-and-red-bakelite cream-and-sugar set ($4), which complements a similar-make coffee urn I already own!

Next, a garage sales, that scored me these massive reflective lamp globes that I’m hoping fits my tension pole lamp. ($20, but rightfully so, they’re in great condition.)

Lastly, the GW Bins (airport) got me an antique boat lamp and an antique blowtorch (both for $3), plus this absolutely lovely vanity/desk ($20) and matching nightstand ($10), which is more than I would normally pay for Bins furniture, but far less than they are worth (IMO). I can’t pin down whether they are pre- or post-1920s… regardless, the furniture shows all the signs of being assembled and possibly cut by hand, very little glue and connective hardware, dovetail joints… so excited to clean them up.

This post will be a lot shorter than the post flairs, as we won't be listing all of them here. But with that being said, we have four different categories of user flairs available that act as branches of your Med journey. Whether it's where you're from, where you've landed or how your papers or lack thereof tell your story. You can also edit user flairs in the first three groupings, because we understand that personal accuracy is important. Especially when you're the one telling the story. :)

This first grouping is for all the homegrown Meds out there.
A flag emoji followed by from *insert country here*. For example, 🇸🇾 From Syria.
The next category we have is for the adoptees, the questioning/Maybe Meds and anyone else who feels culturally uncertain. Flairs like Paperless Med honour the reality that sometimes, there are no records to support someone's Med roots. Maybe Med is for people who feel a pull to the Med on every level, including biological. But still have questions and doubts internally. Uncertain is a flair that can help externalise some of this anxiety, questioning and doubt a bit more.
The third category we have is the diaspora group of flairs. Their layout is as follows: Flag emoji, Diaspora Med, then the country they're currently living in away from home. For instance, 🇬🇧 Diaspora Med, UK.
And finally, the funny and lighthearted flairs for when you want to bring some humour and personality into the mix. These include things like: fluent in flame and sass, cold is a personal attack, vitamin D royalty, lover of coffee, etc.

Whether you're looking for minimalist designs or bold, eye-catching packaging, it’s essential to find a supplier who can provide high-quality, customizable options. The packaging should not only protect the coffee but also communicate your brand’s story and values to consumers.

# 4. Sustainability Matters

As consumers become more eco-conscious, choosing a coffee bag supplier that prioritizes sustainability is an important factor. Many coffee bag suppliers are now offering environmentally friendly options, such as biodegradable bags, recyclable materials, or even bags made from renewable resources. Make sure your supplier is transparent about their sustainability practices and offers packaging options that align with your environmental goals.

# 5. Customer Service and Reliability

A reliable coffee bag supplier should offer consistent quality, quick turnaround times, and excellent customer service. Your supplier should be responsive to your inquiries, offer guidance on packaging choices, and be flexible with order sizes and timelines. It's essential to establish a solid working relationship with your supplier so you can count on them to meet deadlines and provide consistent, high-quality packaging for your coffee brand.

In conclusion, selecting the right coffee bag suppliers is a critical step in building your coffee brand’s identity and ensuring the best possible product delivery to your customers.
