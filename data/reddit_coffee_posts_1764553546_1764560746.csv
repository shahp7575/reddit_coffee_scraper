1pb2ds4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anticonsumption/comments/1pb2ds4/no_spend_date_ideas/,No spend date ideas,"My partner and I play little games with each other for dates and I wanted to share with all of you and then see what your ideas might be. These could be dates or just activities. I feel like they fit the theme of anti consumption/no excess spending. 

1985: you pretend it’s 1985. This means you are 9 years old (the age my partner was in 1985). No phones (they didn’t exist). No car (you are 9 and can’t drive). Your mom has kicked you out of the house to come back when the street lights come on. No debit cards. If you buy something it has to be a similar price point to what it was in 1985 (this is fun). It involves a lot of walking. You normally only end up getting a coffee/ice tea. Maybe find a flea market or tag sale. 

Money bags: this is a long game that takes place within a whole calendar year. You see how much money you can find. You can’t earn it (no working). You can’t ask for it (no panhandling or gifting). You can’t steal it. It has to be money that you find on the ground. Currently I have $17.62 and he has $218.31 (lucky asshole found $210 on the side of the road one day hahah). We like this one because we play all year. When you find money you have to take a picture to send to your partner for the master count.

I am posting today to try and learn what “focusing on yourself” means in the context of dealing with an alcoholic (particularly a spouse).

I’ve been reading a lot and listening to podcasts aimed at individuals with alcoholic spouses (I really like the podcast Love Over Addiction). I’m learning a lot about what codependency looks like and how to break out of that role. The phrase that keeps repeating is to “focus on yourself.”

And I get it — I am not supposed to be a caretaker, monitoring every move. I have to accept my husband’s recovery is his own choice and, in doing that, “focus on myself.”

BUT what does that actually mean in practice? Are we still eating meals together? Watching TV at night together? Do I need to tell him when I’m going out to the store or for coffee like I usually would? I am having a hard time being “normal” but doing things completely solo while we’re still living together is painful in its own way — I feel like I’m missing something. 

I am curious for other peoples’ thoughts and lived experiences on what this really practically looks like.

The world is soft and gray. A cool morning chill is in the air. Your thoughts are still fuzzy, floating. The day hasn't really begun yet. The gentle sound of coffee brewing. You open the cupboard and your hand finds it—the one. The mug that feels just right. You feel its comforting weight. The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song. You wrap your hands around the mug, and a gentle warmth spreads through your fingers, chasing away the chill. You lift it, and the rich aroma of coffee envelops you. You take the first sip. And in that moment, the world sharpens. The day begins. It's a small, perfect sanctuary, just for you.

1pb28qp,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1pb28qp/45m_alcohol_not_part_of_my_life_anymore/,45m alcohol not part of my life anymore.,"For most of my life, alcohol has been part of my routine. It’s been a solid 30 years of drinking—not every day, but honestly, it sure felt like it. Some nights it was just one or two, maybe more on the weekends, maybe less to start the new year.
The issue is that I’ve always considered myself pretty athletic, and it eventually reached a point where alcohol had no business being part of my lifestyle. It’s now been 120 days since I stopped. I didn’t really have a plan to quit, and I never felt like I had a “problem.” Nobody ever said otherwise.
Here’s what’s changed—and what hasn’t.
What’s changed:
When I need to work out, there’s no excuse anymore; I can push that extra mile or rep. I don’t wake up feeling like I need to immediately slam coffee and ibuprofen. My digestion is normal. My skin looks healthier, and I’ve actually lost some weight (though weight was never an issue). Overall, I feel healthier.
What hasn’t changed:
I’m not any happier, and I still go through phases of anxiety. I might actually be more on edge at the end of the day with things like parenting, chores, adult responsibilities, wondering what I missed at work, etc. I don’t sleep any more or any less. I have zero interest in drinking again, but I feel like my personality is a little messed up. Do things start to balance out? I feel like I need to rebuild my sense of humor and attitude.

1pb269v,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1pb269v/be_still_be_silent_part_one/,"""Be Still, Be Silent"" [Part One]","I woke to the sound of wood breathing.

Not creaking—breathing.

A slow inhale under my ribs, an exhale that moved through my chest like air passing through an empty room.

For a second, I stayed still, eyes closed, hoping it was a dream.

Then the pain arrived.

Not sharp. Not sudden. Just a dull, steady pressure behind my sternum, pulsing in time with my heartbeat.

I blinked awake.

Morning light poured through the blinds in thin, chalky stripes. Dust drifted in the beams like ash. My apartment was quiet—the kind of quiet that made my ears ring.

I reached down, half-asleep, and my fingers brushed something rough.

A splinter.

No—several.

A whole cluster of tiny wooden slivers pushed beneath my skin, as if someone had tried to stitch old lumber into my ribs during the night. I jerked instinctively, and a few worked their way out with a soft, wet sound.

My breath caught as I stared at my fingertips, watching the blood bead.

I should've panicked.

Anyone else would have.

Instead, I rolled onto my back and stared at the ceiling, waiting for the feeling to rise. It didn't. What came instead was the smaller, more obedient emotion I had learned as a child:

*Be still.*

*Be silent.*

*Don't make trouble.*

I murmured those old commandments to myself without meaning to as I sat up.

When I pulled the sheet back, I found more splinters sprinkled across the mattress. Pale. Sharp. Old. They smelled like varnish and mildew and something else I recognized immediately:

Church pews.

The ones I used to crawl under when the sermons got too loud. When I needed the dark to swallow me whole. The ones from St. Marrow's—the church they closed down nearly twenty years ago.

A chill slid down my spine.

""No,"" I muttered, shaking my head. ""No, no. This is a nightmare. That's all.""

But my knees throbbed. Hard.

I swung my legs over the bed and looked down.

Deep bruises stained the center of each knee—purple-black and perfectly shaped. Not from a fall. Not from bumping into something.

From kneeling in desperate, begging prayer.

For a long, long time.

A laugh crawled out of my throat. It didn't sound like me.

""Alright,"" I said to the empty room. ""That's… new.""

My phone chimed from the nightstand—a news alert.

I picked it up and froze.

Her name.

My old Sunday school teacher.

The article was brief. A fall, they said. Then, buried in the last paragraph: *Injuries consistent with ritualistic practices. The victim had ties to St. Marrow's Church, shut down in 2006 following allegations of abuse...*

My stomach lurched, and the phone slipped from my hand, clattering to the floor.

Something moved inside me—not physically, but deeper. Like a shadow turning over. Like a memory waking up and stretching its limbs.

Bile rose to my throat, and before I knew what was happening, I doubled over the toilet, retching. For a moment, the room tilted. My nostrils and throat burned as the room seemed to start fading from me.

The morning light flickered as if something passed in front of it—something small, something familiar. I smelled dust and old hymn books, wood rubbed smooth by decades of kneeling children.

And then—

A breath brushed the back of my neck.

A prayer I hadn't heard in twenty years.

My own breath caught. ""Hello?""

No response.

Just that smell—that awful, nostalgic smell of varnish and hymnals.

I pressed my palm to my ribs. The splinters there pulsed once, as if responding.

It felt as though something in me was waking up, something that had lain dormant for almost two decades.

Something I'd long since buried under those pews, hidden from.

And it was coming back through that old wood.





I was shaking now, and with unsteady hands I wiped my mouth and forced myself upright. My legs were just as shaky, barely keeping me up. The bruises on my knees pulsed like fresh wounds, even though the skin wasn't broken. They looked… earned. As if someone—or something—had guided my body into that posture until it obeyed.

It was like I'd never left that dreadful place at all.

My mind wandered back to the article, to Ms.—

*No.* I won't go there. I've tried not to think about that woman or that place since I put it all behind me. I'm not religious anymore. I don't believe in God. I don't take commands from anyone claiming to speak for Him—not through guilt, not through fear, not while preying on the vulnerable.

No.

I was a child then. I was a victim then.

Today I am a woman who knows better.

I pulled myself to my feet and stumbled to the bathroom. The tile was cold enough on my bare feet to jolt a shiver out of me. When I flipped on the light, the harsh brightness carved out the shadows under my eyes. My reflection looked pale, hollowed, as if the night had taken a piece of my soul while I slept.

I lifted my shirt.

More splinters. Smaller, barely visible unless the light caught them. Embedded along the curve of my ribs like a row of wooden thorns, trying to push through.

""Jesus,"" I breathed. ""What the hell?""

The reflection mouthed the words with me, but a beat behind—like it was learning the shape of them. My pulse quickened. I stared at my own face, waiting for it to happen again, but my reflection synced back up, obedient once more.

I leaned closer. My breath fogged the mirror. I could smell the church again—dust, cracked leather Bibles, the sweet mold that lived in hymnals that had sat damp too many summers.

I blinked, and for half a second, I swore I saw something behind my shoulder in the mirror.

A small shape.

A girl-sized shadow.

Head bowed.

Hands clasped.

Like a child caught praying too hard.

My breath stuttered in my throat.

""Stop,"" I said to the empty room. ""You're hallucinating. You just—you're stressed. That's it. This is just stress.""

But stress didn't leave relics of an abandoned, boarded-up, and forgotten church in my bed.

I turned the sink on and splashed cold water on my face. It steadied me for all of three seconds before the smell of wet wood filled the bathroom. Not the clean smell of lumber—this was older, darker. The pews again. The ones with splinters the size of needles. The ones that left tiny cuts on my palms when I crawled under them.

My ribs squeezed.

""No,"" I said again, louder this time. ""You're here. You're in your apartment. You're—""

A knock.

Soft.

Three taps.

Against the bathroom door.

My blood iced.

The apartment was empty.

I lived alone.

The knock came again—light, hesitant. The way a child knocks when she's afraid of waking someone.

My voice barely scraped out. ""Who's there?""

Silence.

Then, through the door, I heard it:

A small breath.

Shaking.

Familiar.

I reached for the doorknob with an unsteady hand. My heart thudded against the splinters in my ribs, each beat sending another pulse of dull pain radiating outward.

The metal knob felt cold against my palm.

I twisted it.

The door swung open.

Nothing was there.

But the hallway air was colder, as if something had passed through it. And the floor just outside the bathroom held a faint trail of dust—like the kind that collected under the old pews.

It led deeper into the apartment. Away from the front door.

Toward the living room.

As if something small had walked in while I wasn't looking.

And all at once, I wasn't convinced I had woken up alone.





I stepped cautiously down the hallway, every breath thin and shaky. The trail of dust—fine, gray, unmistakably old—led from the bathroom toward the living room like footprints too small to belong to me and too deliberate to be an accident.

I followed it.

Each step I took seemed to make the air colder, as though the temperature dropped a degree every few feet. By the time I reached the living room doorway, I could see my breath.

That was impossible.

My apartment never got this cold, not even in winter.

I stopped.

The dust trail ended at my coffee table.

And sitting neatly in the center of it—placed carefully, precisely—was a book.

A small, battered paperback with a cracked spine and peeling corners.

Its red cover had darkened to a rusty brown with age.

I recognized it instantly, and my heart sank.

*The St. Marrow's Children's Hymnal.*

My hands went numb. This couldn't be real.

""I threw this away,"" I said aloud.

No—I didn't just throw it away. I had stood behind the church the week they shut it down, watching as they boarded up the windows and barred the doors, making sure no one ever set foot inside that old sanctuary again.

I had held this exact hymnal, flipping through it with shaking hands, then hurled it into the old stone well behind the parish hall.

I watched it fade into the black abyss. I heard it hit the bottom with a wet slap against water twenty feet down.

""How…?"" My voice cracked.

I stepped closer. The room felt tight, as if the walls were inhaling. Nostalgia mixed with nausea. The smell of varnish pressed against my sinuses.

*Don't pick it up.*

*Don't touch it.*

*Don't—*

My fingers closed around it anyway. Every instinct screamed to leave it alone.

I lifted it.

Dust bloomed into the air like breath.

The book fell open in my hands on its own, as if something guided it.

Page 34.

The pages should have been pulp after twenty years in that well. Instead, they looked freshly printed, the ink dark and crisp. Only the edges were damp, as if the book had been retrieved moments ago instead of decades.

The children's prayer we all had to memorize, the one they made us say before the ""obedience lessons.""

*Be still.*

*Be silent.*

*Be empty for Him.*

My heart lurched.

Something clenched behind my sternum.

I snapped the book shut—but a piece of paper fell from between the pages and drifted to the floor.

I stared at it for a long time before I could bring myself to pick it up.

It was a folded attendance sticker.

The kind they used to hand out to children for showing up to services.

A white lamb in the corner.

A smiling sun.

And my name.

Written in blocky, childish handwriting:

GEMMA — PEW 3

My knees went weak. For a moment, I couldn't breathe.

Pew 3.

The one I always hid under when I thought no one would notice.

I pressed a shaking hand to my mouth. ""No,"" I said. ""This isn't real. This can't—""

A sound cut me off.

Not loud.

Not harsh.

Just a rhythmic tapping coming from deeper inside the apartment.

*Tap.*

*Tap.*

*Tap.*

Like someone… or something… gently knocking.

Not at the front door.

Not at the windows.

Inside.

Somewhere down the hall.

My pulse hammered.

I turned my head slowly, terrified to look, more terrified not to.

And down the dim hallway, just at the bend where my bedroom waited, I saw it:

A small, dusty handprint on the wall.

The size of a child's.

And next to it, written faintly in what looked like smeared dust:

BE STILL

I dropped the hymnal.

The air left my lungs.

Something was here with me.

Something that knew my name.

Something that remembered St. Marrow's.

Something that walked through my apartment while I slept.





The handprint.

The message.

The cold.

I needed to call my therapist. Something wasn't right. Had I been taking my meds? I was pretty sure I'd been regular about it, but maybe I'd missed doses without noticing. The stress, the news about her—perhaps it triggered a dissociative episode.

My crisis plan. I should follow my crisis plan.

Ground yourself. Five things you can see. Four things you can touch. Three things you can hear. Come on, you can do this.

But my hands were shaking too hard to count.

Maybe I needed to be hospitalized again. Maybe I needed someone with me. It wasn't safe for me to be alone, especially when I started thinking about that part of my past.

I tried to back away, but the hallway stretched strangely, like distance was something elastic and unreliable. My heartbeat thudded against the splinters in my ribs, each pulse a dull ache that made the world shimmer at the edges.

And then—

Without warning—

Everything snapped dark.

Not gently.

Not like fainting.

More like someone grabbed a chain inside my skull and yanked, pulling me down into a well with no bottom.

No falling.

No sound.

Just absence.

A command carved into the silence:

*Be still.*





When I surfaced, it was to the sound of my own voice.

Murmuring.

No—praying.

""…empty me… empty me… empty me…""

My eyes flew open.

I was kneeling on the floor beside my bed.

Hard.

Too hard. My knees felt like they would split open at the bone.

My hands were clasped so tightly my knuckles had gone bloodless white, fingers rigid with effort. Each prayer forced itself between my clenched teeth with a rhythm I didn't recognize as my own.

""…make me hollow… make me worthy…""

I couldn't stop.

Couldn't move my jaw.

The words poured out on their own, shaped by a tongue that felt numb and foreign.

My body wasn't mine.

A sharp sting shot through my palms. For a second, I couldn't understand it—until I looked down.

Splinters.

Dozens of them.

Wood driven between my fingers, pushed deep enough that blood slicked the cracks between my knuckles. My hands were clasped around a chunk of wood.

No—a carved wooden edge.

A pew fragment.

The decorative pattern burned itself into my memory even before I entirely took it in. I had pressed my face against this exact wood as a child, repeating prayers I didn't understand, waiting for the pastor's hand to fall on my shoulder.

But this piece—it hadn't been in my apartment before. I would have seen it. Would have remembered.

It had appeared in my hands as if summoned.

My stomach turned.

""I—"" I tried to speak, to break the prayer, but the word caught in my throat like a hook.

My head jerked downward sharply, violently, as if something shoved it. My forehead hit the pew fragment with a hollow thud.

And my mouth continued.

""…be silent… be still… be emptied for Him…""

Tears blurred my vision.

I tried to rip my hands apart, but they wouldn't budge. The clasp was too tight, too deliberate. My fingers ached, but the pressure only increased, as if someone—some*thing*—was forcing me to hold on.

Then my body shifted.

My spine bent backward in a rigid arch, my knees grinding into the floor. A deep, guttural sound rose from my chest—half sob, half resistance—before the prayer thrust itself louder, faster, frantic.

I could feel it.

Something was crawling upward through me.

A presence with small hands and a familiar fear.

A child's terror.

A child's obedience.

A child's voice using my lungs.

""…make me clean… make me empty…""

My vision flickered.

Light sputtered.

My ears rang.

""…make me holy…""

Then—just as suddenly as it seized me—it let go.

The prayer cut off mid-word.

My hands fell open.

The pew fragment clattered to the floor—and when I blinked, it was gone, vanished as if it had never been there at all.

I collapsed forward, gasping, cheek pressed to the cold hardwood. Sweat slicked my skin, mixing with blood and the smell of old varnish.

The room was quiet again.

Too quiet.

I pushed myself up on shaking arms, disoriented and nauseous. My knees were bleeding through my pajamas. My palms were filled with splinters. My throat felt raw, scraped from the inside.

Was any of this real? Had I done this to myself during a break? But the splinters—I couldn't have—the hymnal in the well—

And carved into the dust on the floor in front of me—letters shakily formed by my own hands while something else controlled them—were the exact words from the hymnal:

**BE STILL**

**BE SILENT**

**BE EMPTY**

I stared at them, heart hammering.

I hadn't written them.

But my body… something in my body had remembered.

Something inside me was praying.

And it wasn't me.

From somewhere in the apartment—maybe my bedroom, maybe closer—I heard it again.

That soft, familiar breathing.

Wood exhaling.





I didn't sleep.

Couldn't.

I stayed on the floor for a long time, hunched over where the pew fragment had been, breathing in shallow, broken gulps while the words *be still, be silent, be empty* stared up at me from the dust.

At some point, I forced myself to stand.

At some point, I washed the blood from my hands.

At some point, I changed my clothes because they were soaked through with sweat and fear.

But I wasn't really there for any of it.

Every time I looked down at my palms, the splinters seemed to shift beneath the skin, as if settling into place.

As if rooting.

Eventually, I found myself sitting on the couch, gripping my phone like it was the only real thing left in the room. My fingers were unsteady, but I wasn't cold.

No.

I was vibrating with something that felt like static under my ribs.

I opened my news app to distract myself, to prove the world was still ordinary—unchanged by whatever had just crawled up through me.

The moment the page loaded, I froze.

Another headline.

Another name I recognized.

My breath left my body in one sharp exhale.

*""Former St. Marrow's Pastor Found Dead in Apparent Self-Mortification Ritual.""*

My skin went numb.

The article was worse:

*Knees split open. Hands clasped so tightly that bones fractured. Forehead bruised from repeated impact. Foul play suspected. Authorities reopening investigation into Sunday school teacher's death.*

The same posture I had woken in.

The same posture they made us practice during ""obedience.""

For a moment, the screen blurred. I thought I might pass out, but no—my body held me up. Too tense. Too awake. Like something inside me didn't want me to collapse.

I shut the phone off.

Turned it back on.

Reread the headline, hoping it would change.

It didn't.

A cold, thin pressure unfurled around my ribs, too faint to understand but unmistakably there. Small fingers brushing dust from a pew.

""No,"" I said out loud. ""No. No, I didn't—I couldn't—""

My hands shook so violently that I nearly dropped the phone.

I opened my contacts.

Scrolled to Dr. Renner.

My thumb hovered over the call button.

I didn't want to sound crazy.

I didn't want to say anything out loud. Saying it made it real.

But something inside me nudged—gentle and cold—as if encouraging me to stay quiet.

I fought it.

Pressed ""Call.""

The ringing made my heartbeat spike.

""Dr. Renner's office,"" came her calm, professional voice. ""This is Dr. Renner.""

I swallowed, but my throat barely worked. ""It's me,"" I said, my voice thin and shaken. ""I—I need to talk to you. Something's wrong.""

She paused. ""You sound frightened. Are you safe?""

The question made something twist in my chest.

I wasn't sure.

""I—something happened last night. I lost time. I blacked out. And I…"" My voice cracked. ""Dr. Renner, I woke up praying.""

""…Praying?""

""Not like—just praying. I mean…"" I looked down at my bruised knees, at the splinters under my skin. ""Like I wasn't the one doing it.""

A soft inhale on her end.

Not judgment.

Recognition.

""Are you alone right now?"" she asked.

""Yes."" My voice wavered. ""I think so.""

""You think so?""

I closed my eyes. Behind my eyelids, I saw dust, the underside of pews, small hands pressed together in forced obedience—a shadow-shape of myself at seven years old.

""I don't know what's happening to me,"" I said. ""And I'm scared I—""

My breath hitched.

I almost said *I'm scared I killed someone.*

But the words stuck, as if something didn't want me to speak them.

""I'm scared,"" I corrected softly. ""I'm scared of myself.""

There was a long, thoughtful silence.

""Can you come in today?"" she asked gently. ""Right now, if possible.""

I hesitated.

A faint warmth pulsed beneath my ribs—like a heartbeat that wasn't mine.

A child's voice, close enough that I couldn't be sure whether it came from inside or from somewhere behind me, breathed:

*Be still.*

My throat tightened.

""…I don't know,"" I said.

""Try,"" Dr. Renner said. ""Just try to come. We'll figure this out together.""

The line clicked off.

The apartment was silent again.

Except I wasn't.

Something inside me was listening.





I don't remember the drive to Dr. Renner's office.

One moment, I was sitting on my couch, phone still warm in my hand; the next, I was standing in her waiting room, my coat half off, my breath fogging the air like I'd walked through winter.

But it was warm inside.

Too warm.

I don't remember my hands on the wheel. Don't remember my foot on the pedal. Don't remember unlocking my car or locking my apartment door behind me.

But somehow I arrived.

My whole body felt out of sync—like I had skipped frames, like pieces of time had been cut out and taped over.

Dr. Renner stepped into the doorway with her usual calm smile. ""Come in.""

My mouth tried to return the smile, but the muscles didn't cooperate. They pulled strangely, stiffly, as if they were remembering expression instead of feeling it.

I followed her down the short hallway. The floorboards didn't creak, but I could hear them anyway—like echoes from somewhere else. Somewhere older. Wooden. Hollow.

Her office smelled like chamomile tea and paper. Safe smells. Human ones.

I sat on the couch. Dr. Renner took her usual chair across from me and crossed her legs, her expression calm, welcoming.

""What happened last night?"" she asked gently.

I opened my mouth.

Nothing came out.

Just a thin rush of air.

Dr. Renner didn't push. She waited.

The pressure behind my sternum rose. I pressed my palm there instinctively. The splinters under my skin pulsed once in response—almost like they were nodding.

""I… I lost time,"" I finally said.

""How much time?""

""I don't know. Minutes? Hours?"" I shook my head. ""I woke up on the floor. Kneeling.""

Her gaze sharpened slightly. ""Like prayer?""

I nodded.

""Were you praying?""

""I wasn't. My body was."" My voice cracked on the last word.

Dr. Renner didn't flinch. She leaned forward slightly, resting her elbows on her knees. ""And when you woke up…?""

""I couldn't stop."" My hands twisted in my lap. ""The words just kept coming—old prayers. The same ones I haven't said since I was a kid. My jaw wouldn't move the way I told it to. My body wasn't listening.""

She nodded slowly. ""Dissociative trance states can feel exactly like that. But tell me—did anything trigger it? Any memory? Any objects? Any stressors?""

I hesitated.

The news headline.

The hymnal.

The pew fragment.

The handprint.

I could see she was studying me now.

""There was…something in my apartment,"" I said quietly.

""What kind of something?""

I swallowed hard. ""A book. From St. Marrow's. One I threw away years ago.""

Her face softened, not in pity but in recognition. ""You went through something traumatic in that church. It would make sense for your mind to bring symbols of that time back into your awareness.""

""It wasn't just that."" I shook my head. ""I—didn't bring it there. I didn't find it in a drawer. It was on my table. Set out, waiting for me.""

She studied me for a long moment.

""And you're sure someone else couldn't have put it there?""

""Who?"" My voice rose, thin and sharp. ""Who even has keys to my apartment? Who would know about that book? About my pew? About where I used to hide?""

Her calm didn't break.

Mine did.

Tears blurred my vision, but I didn't quite cry. The tears stayed suspended, like my face was afraid to commit to the emotion.

""Gemma,"" she said gently. ""You're dissociating. That's not your fault. Trauma fragments. It leaves echoes. Sometimes the mind tries to reclaim lost pieces in ways that feel… alien.""

She paused.

""Do you feel unsafe with yourself?""

The question slid under my skin like a blade.

I hesitated too long.

""I…I don't know,"" I admitted.

Dr. Renner nodded gently. ""Can you tell me what your body was doing when you regained awareness? Anything physical that stood out?""

My mouth opened before I could stop it.

""My hands were bleeding.""

Her eyes flicked to them, still wrapped in bandages. ""From what?""

""Splinters,"" I said. ""A lot of them.""

She inhaled slowly. ""From your floor?""

I shook my head.

""No,"" I said quietly. ""From a pew. A real wooden pew. From St. Marrow's.""

Something flickered across her face then—concern tightening around the edges of her composure.

""Gemma… St. Marrow's has been boarded up for years. No one has set foot inside that building in over a decade. It would be far too dangerous for anyone to try to enter an abandoned building that old.""

The air felt thinner.

""I know,"" I said.

Silence stretched between us, pulsing and electric.

She leaned forward again, her voice quieter now. ""May I ask something difficult?""

I nodded.

""When you were praying… did it feel like you were the child you used to be?""

A shiver ran through me.

""No,"" I said carefully. ""It felt like… the child I used to be was praying through me.""

Dr. Renner sat back. Her expression shifted—not disbelief, not dismissal, but something more profound. Something like recognition of a possibility she didn't want to acknowledge.

""Gemma… you're describing a type of traumatic fragmentation. A severe one. But the physical elements—the splinters, the book—those don't entirely fit the clinical pattern.""

No. It certainly didn't. Something was bending the pattern. Something old.

Something carved from wood and obedience.

""What if it's not trauma?"" I said. ""What if it's something else?""

Dr. Renner's lips parted slightly. ""What are you afraid it is?""

I stared at my hands.

My palms tingled under the bandages.

The pulsing beneath my ribs grew warm—too warm.

""A return,"" I said quietly. ""Not a memory. Not a fragment. A return.""

Dr. Renner didn't speak.

And then—barely audible—something breathed behind me.

A soft exhale.

Child-sized.

Every muscle in my body locked. My breath stopped.

Dr. Renner's eyes flicked over my shoulder.

They widened.

Just a fraction.

""Gemma,"" she said, her voice suddenly too careful, too measured. ""Don't turn around.""",1,1764559877.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

Rita’s fingers tightened around the envelope in her hand as she walked up the steps to Aaron’s house in The Flats, a quiet, upscale neighborhood in Beverly Hills. The sun was dipping low, casting long shadows across the manicured lawns and elegant homes. Her pulse thumped in her ears, but her face was carefully composed, almost serene. A week of restless waiting, a week of wondering if she’d imagined the similarities, had led to this moment. The lab results were in her grasp, clear and undeniable.

It had all started at the gala a week ago. Nicole had brought her along under the guise of spending time together and observing the event, but Rita had found herself drawn to Aaron from across the room. She watched him carefully, noting his gestures, his laugh, the tilt of his head when he spoke. Every small detail, every familiar mannerism, seemed to confirm the suspicions that had been growing inside her for years. To clear any doubt, Rita quietly collected what she needed at the gala. By the time she returned home, her mind was made up: she had to face him.

Rita paused at the front door, brushing a strand of hair from her face and taking a deep breath. The house loomed before her, warm beige walls and a neatly kept garden giving no hint of the storm poised at the doorstep. She could hear her heartbeat in the quiet, steady, insistent.

Then she lifted her hand and pressed the doorbell. The soft chime echoed through the house, and Rita took a careful step back, letting the envelope stay hidden against her side.",4,1764559752.0,AIDungeon,1,1.0,False

Because my life became so good I didn't consistently continue to apply the practice since there was not much I wanted, or I took enough pleasure in the play of wanting and uncertainty that it didn't feel necessary.

  
Since my illness the only time I have used his practice is when I had an allergic reaction to a migraine medicine in an ER and had the worst panic attack of my life, in which case I used it to try to manifest never feeling that fear again.

  
In some ways this has worked. About 10 days ago I got into a major car wreck and broke many bones and suffered some internal injuries. It was very painful but despite the agony and usual fear of pain I experience I was blessed to not spiral into the depth of panic that I had felt that one night in the ER. So in that way I believe it worked.

  
My concern stems from my constant, low-grade anxiety about terrible disasters. This aspect of my personality has dramatically improved since Neville but it still exists. Rather than fight it or try to focus on it or wrestle with it, I mostly ignore it and just try to visualize how I want to feel. But I have almost involuntary powerful, in-depth imaginations of what it would be like to die or suffer terrible pain: in a car crash, drowning, burning, by a serial killer, etc. These thoughts are less frequent but still there and I don't feel like I can fight them.

  
My life has been so good lately and things going generally so well that my anxiety seemed to spike despite me otherwise feeling happy and calm. I understand this is a paradox. But while I continued to do my practice for small things (passing a school test, etc.) and generally remain loving and appreciative, that anxiety still existed and those intense visualizations slipped in. Hours before my wreck I remember driving to the coffee shop thinking simultaneously, ""I am so blessed by God to have driven so much and never had a car accident"" and also ""It's been a long time since something really bad happened, this must mean something bad will happen.""

  
Then hours later...

  
I am looking for some kind person who has maybe more experience to give me insight into this phenomenon. Did my involuntary rumination attract this disaster? Did the fact I regularly have these powerful, in-depth imagination of extreme pain do something to bring it to be?

  
I am a little untethered and unsure how to feel. I don't question the Law. I know that tonight when I go to bed I will use it again to try to feel how I want: that I am safe, that this crash was somehow a blessing that will reveal itself in time, that everything is in control in a higher order, that I don't need to be afraid.

My dad has no respect for hygiene and has really poor habits that disgust me. 

He’s constantly fiddling with his nose - pulling out hairs, twisting them, picking etc. If it’s not his nose, it’s his ears, and same thing - pulling hairs, twisting, digging for ear wax. He’s always rubbing his feet and his feet stink. One time I saw him clipping his toe nails, scratch his face with the same hands he was using to dig into his toes, and then he blew his nose into the same tissue with his toe clippings. He doesn’t brush his teeth, only occasionally uses mouthwash. He sneezes, sometimes into his hand, and then proceeds to rub it into his face or continue around the kitchen. I’ve seen him blow his nose into the ground (thankfully outside but still in the back yard) like a spit from his nostrils - by blocking one side and giving a big blow - no tissue, and just carry on. 

Besides this, there’s other practises that give me the absolute ick. His diet is horrendous, where to even begin... He doesn’t cook, just boiled potato, egg, bread and garlic. Sometimes instant noodles as a bonus. He doesn’t put this away in the fridge… he leaves it out overnight for days and still eats the same thing off the stove for days, even if I put in the fridge he puts it back out. 6 heaped teaspoons of sugar in instant coffee several times a day. He’s learnt ‘sugar is bad’ after his doctor told him he’s looking diabetic, so now it’s honey or syrup in everything because in his mind that curbs the issue… also cake isn’t sugar because he can’t see the granules. He puts honey and syrup in his potato and egg, alongside his sickly sweet coffee. He doesn’t shower as frequently as he should and often smells. His laundry smells awful even after a wash because he doesn’t use detergent properly. His gut is mess… it’s diarrhoea all the time. Of course it is…

Because of all this, he’s dumb and foggy-brained all the time. He laughs things off or goes away for a sook. It’s reached a point where I can barely see any of his positive qualities anymore. He’s only getting older and I’m disgusted more every day. 

Looking at all this together, I think he just likes being gross… it started as playful ‘eww dad!’ laughing and playing when we were little, to more gentle confrontations, and as we’ve gotten older and the disrespect for hygiene become louder there’s bitter resentment, horror, and ostracism and he just ignores it all as if we’re the problem. He has other infantile behaviour that exacerbates all of this but that’s another can of worms. 

Is anyone able to explain why he’s like this, and whether this is a mental illness, and if so what it is?",1,1764559417.0,offmychest,0,0.67,False
1pb20gl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AtlasBookClub/comments/1pb20gl/advice_you_dont_need_grindset_culture_you_need/,"[Advice] You don’t need “grindset” culture, you need structure that actually works","Most people aren’t lazy. They’re just drowning in noise, stuck in the loop of “do more, be more” without any real system to make it work. Hustle culture told everyone to wake up at 4 AM and “manifest success” by sheer willpower. But that advice came from influencers who thrive off your burnout. What actually works isn’t doing more, it’s building structure that makes execution automatic.

This post is for anyone who feels like they’re trying everything from productivity hacks, planners, and morning routines, but still feels chaotic inside. The insights here come from cognitive science, peak performance research, and not some viral TikTok guru. These are tools that have helped high-performers stay consistent without the fake motivation pump.

Here’s a breakdown of the structure that actually works:

- **Design friction into your environment.** James Clear in *Atomic Habits* talks about “choice architecture.” Make good activities easier to start and bad ones harder to access. Want to read more? Keep a book near your bed. Want to check your phone less? Delete the social apps or use grayscale mode. Environment always beats willpower.

- **Your brain loves checklist loops.** In the *Huberman Lab Podcast*, Andrew Huberman explains how task completion releases dopamine. Not reward, but progress. That’s why breaking big goals into micro-tasks works. Even a 5-minute win like replying to an overdue email gives your brain a “progress hit” that builds momentum.

- **Stop trusting motivation. Build time blocks instead.** Cal Newport in *Deep Work* emphasizes scheduling your focus the same way you’d book a meeting. Motivation is unreliable, but pre-decided time blocks with clear intentions reduce decision fatigue. It’s not about doing more, it’s about doing what matters on time.

- **Use the 80 percent rule.** Productivity psychologist Oliver Burkeman (author of *Four Thousand Weeks*) suggests aiming for 80 percent effort, not 100. Perfectionism paralyzes execution. Show up, ship the work, then iterate. That’s how elite performers stay consistent. 
Not by maxing out, but by sustaining better-than-average output every single day.

- **Stack your habits, don’t chase them.** BJ Fogg from Stanford talks about “habit stacking” in *Tiny Habits.* The idea: pair a new habit with an existing one so it rides the identity wave. Like doing 10 pushups after brushing your teeth, or writing 3 bullet journal notes after making coffee. It makes follow-through frictionless.

- **Don’t start the day with your inbox.** Research from Gloria Mark (*Attention Span*, 2023) shows that reactive work like emails and Slack switches your brain into “task response mode,” not “deep thinking mode.” Starting your day with your priorities and not someone else’s can double productivity without working extra hours.

- **Track energy, not just time.** Daniel Pink’s book *When* explores how energy levels fluctuate throughout the day. Some people peak early, others late. If you’re forcing deep work during your worst mental window, no productivity system will work. Align your most important work with high-energy windows instead of trying to be a morning person just because a YouTuber said so.

- **Make your calendar your second brain.** Productivity coach Tiago Forte recommends using your calendar not just for meetings, but for thinking time, chores, learning, and rest. Treat it like a mirror of who you're becoming. If your calendar doesn’t reflect your goals, don’t expect your life to either.

- **Weekly reviews over daily panic.** David Allen’s *Getting Things Done* method emphasizes doing weekly reviews of all your tasks and goals. It calms your mind and prevents the obsession with “urgent over important.” One hour a week planning saves 10 hours of flailing.

- **The system is the self.** Clinical psychologist Dr. Jordan Peterson often says that your daily structure *is* your identity. Systems don’t just help you do stuff, they help you become someone. You don’t rise to the level of your ambitions. You fall to the level of your structure.

Hustle culture thrives on guilt. Real structure thrives on clarity. You don’t need more grinding. You need systems that make discipline feel automatic.",2,1764559411.0,AtlasBookClub,0,1.0,False
1pb1znz,https://www.reddit.com/r/ScaryStory/comments/1pb1znz/the_monster_of_newport_rd/,The Monster of Newport Rd,"I was just seventeen years old when I was given world shattering news, my dad had stage four esophagus cancer. That word has a tremendous amount of weight attached to it, once that word enters your life it is like a cockroach. You can’t get rid of it no matter how you try to erase it, the darkness, fear, and the unknown never truly leaves you. From that moment onward my life had become dedicated to taking care of my dad, my days became school then going to the house to visit my dad then back home and repeat. I had never met a man with such horrific luck in my life, he had gotten every single negative side effect you could’ve  possibly imagined. He had lost his hearing, he had described it has be permanently had earmuffs over his ears. The doctor then recommended he try a different treatment to hopefully counter the ill effects of the hearing loss, the new medication took his taste from him. He would cry at the dinner table barely able to eat, I remember one ill fated dinner he threw the plate against the wall and began to ball his eyes out. “It all tastes like fucking sewage” he shouted as he rushed over to the bathroom to throw up the little food he had eaten. After three days of him not eating he was once again put onto his third treatment. The third one crippled him, he had developed neuropathy. He lost the ability to walk and he could even hold a plate with him dropping it. The neuropathy was the beginning of the end, he became bed ridden. The day he came home all of the energy had shifted and changed into a thick heavy aura the weighed down the entire home. The days started feeling slower and longer, felt like the entire house had been filled with a thick viscous syrup.  He went from being the pilar of the family, a man who coached every sports team, running and screaming on the sidelines to a shriveled man with barely the strength to hold a half filled plastic cup. His stomach had become hard and swollen from the cancerous fluid that began leaking into his abdominal cavity. Draining his stomach over and over having the brown liquid into light bulb looking bottles, after the draining his breathing would finally improve and he would regain just a touch of the life and energy he usually would have. At night that’s when things would become weird, I’d go to the bathroom and he would hear my dad in a sing song voice “I’m dying im dyinggg” to himself in the dark. I still remember one night I woke up to take a leak and I hear muffled talked through my door, once I walk out my door I wanted to check in on him. “Hey dad, you alright” I asked. “yeah buddy, you actually just missed your great grandma.” He said with an almost child like enthusiasm. “Okay?  Where did you see her?” “she was right there in the corner of the living room! You must’ve just missed her.” That night made it hard to go to sleep after that, I would hear him talking or singing or just plain crying. It all came to a head in on the 26th of November, I just remember being so tired. God I was so tired, I had finally lost the battle of going on minimal sleep. I gave in to the soft felt of the couch, on that night it really felt like all the stresses of the world vanished. I was in the living room with him, if he needed me he could a just called me. The next thing I knew I woke up to a voice screaming my dad’s name. “Tony! Tony!” Movies make death look for grandiose, some large spectacle that is full of pageantry. I can tell you that is 100% the furthest thing from the truth.  I another up from my nap to a scene that is now forever burned into the deepest recesses of my brain. He was breathing slow, agonal, he had a wild look in his eyes. One that a you would see on a farm animal in the kill shoot, aimless fear and incomprehensible understanding.  I rushed over to him and tried to put his nasal cannula on his nose, but for some reason I will never know he turned his head from me. I can’t remember  his favorite color or the recipe to his chilli but I can never for the look he gave me when he took his last breath. I slumped onto the floor in defeat, all the plans, all the dreams we shared just gone in the blink of an eye. After the cornor came and took my dad away I just sat on his hospice bed in complete silence. I sat there dumbfounded, my whole world had just crumbled right in front of me. As I thought to myself “how on earth can this get any worse,” she came. It started slow like a sickness it started small, I saw a shadow in the corner of my eye to random bumps and noises. Then one day it kicked up a notch or two, I was showering home alone and from down the hall I could hear foot steps.. slow deliberate, the steps slowly got louder as they got closer then they suddenly stopped at the door. One large bang on the door sent me damn near through the roof “ holy shit! hello” I said in a panick. I’m not sure if you’ve ever been butt naked being put into fight or flight but I flung the shower curtain open and bum rushed the door. I grab that handle and took a quick deep breath, I flung the door open ready to face whatever was behind the door. I look to the right and the left analyzing what coulda made that sound, after a few moments I just assumed I must’ve heard something. Maybe  the lack of sleep and loneliness played some tricks on me. The torment went on for weeks, but it had just been little things, knocks, noises, shadows. Things to just make me question myself did I just hear that? But it slowly ramped up in intensity it then became hearing voices. I would be fillin out a college application “that’s too hard for you.” It wanted to beat me down, make me weak, vulnerable.  I started staying at home more I would ignore friends and family, the more I heard the voices the more of a burden I felt. This thing was stripping me down piece by piece, whisper every insecurity I ever had, every little thing I was ever worried about they confirmed were true. I had been just so weighed down, so mentally and emotionally exhausted, I had decided I wouldn’t go to school one morning. Just lay in the couch and rot, but that thing had another plan. I was watching some king of the hill and trying to relax and charge my mental battery. But then a familiar sound rang through the house, the slow quiet creek of the floor boards. I peered  around the tv and all the air had been sucked from my lungs. Standing down the hall was a sight that had me frozen in terror. It’s hair was black an greasy it covered her face, her skin was pale and thin. So thin you could see the veins, arteries, muscles and joints move and shift underneath it. Her breast hung down to her mid thigh, her nails had to have been 3-4 inches long. The creature said “sweetie are you going to be late for school?” In low almost mocking tone. Before I could fully comprehend the atrocious scene infront of me she lunged at me, her limps moved abnormally bending and twisting and ways that shouldn’t have been possible. She was on top of me almost instantaneously, I could feel her bony hand wrap around my throat. The grip slowly getting tighter and tighter. My airway was almost completely closed off and I was starting to pass out. I noticed out of the corner of my eye I noticed my coffee mug on the living room table. With all my remaining strength I reached out and grabbed the ceramic mug and slammed it against the creatures head. The mug shattered and the beast screeched in pain, with the tiny amount recoil from the monster I was able to shift position and slam the remaining shard into its head. The sharp edge went into the skull with a loud ripping sound as flesh and blood poured out the newly opened wound. At that point she was off balance enough I was able to break grip on my neck. I got up and decided I was done living with the burden of this monstrosity in my life.  For the first time in a long time I was gunna do something for me, I was going to rid myself of this horrid woman. I ran to the hallway closet, I can feel the creatures footsteps behind me. I didn’t have much time, I threw open the door and saw my old childhood baseball bat. I grabbed it and gripped the handle tightly and in one quick motion I flipped my hips and brought the bag down on the pale decrepit head of that thing. It made a loud pop just like when someone he’s that perfect home run, she slumped to the floor. I couldn’t tell if she was moving but I didn’t care, I wish I could tell you what happened next. I just blacked out, I just let bringing the bat down over and over and over again till my arms went numb. My arms were exhausted and I dropped the bat, I just took a step back and just saw a bloody mess of flesh and crimson all over the walls, floor and ceiling. I just packed a duffle bag, got in my car and drove to the air port. I decided to move far away from that house and try and escape just all the horrible things that had happened in that house. I found myself living in Las Vegas, in a nice quiet suburb. I actually did make something of my life I’m a firefighter and have a wife and a dog. I had just gotten home from my twenty four hour shift and just tossed myself on my bed to relax a bit. I was thinking to myself about how happy I was with how my life had been going. Just as I had begun to slowly drifting off for a quick power nap my dog shot up outta bed and started growling at my closest. I thought he was just being dramatic and heard the house settling, but then I heard a familiar knock from inside the closest. The end",1,1764559348.0,ScaryStory,0,0.99,False
1pb1zgz,https://v.redd.it/4ct8jp61ei4g1,The true reason of why the Algerian currency is falling,"I am seeing a lot of very uneducated comments around the fall of the DZD in the black market. No the money isn't falling because someone is 'printing' money like Nekkaz seems to believe [https://x.com/larevueafrique/status/1995124810624483611](https://x.com/larevueafrique/status/1995124810624483611)



The reason, isn't because people are exiting the cash in suitcases either.



The reason is the 2026 Finance Law that provisions subsidies for mega projects in Algeria, and the internal debt is growing to finance these projects. The 2026 budget allocates a colossal 657.65 billion Algerian dinars (approximately €4.5 billion) to commodity subsidies alone. Key allocations include: €331 billion for cereals. €96 billion for milk. €100 billion to stabilize prices for essential goods like sugar, oil, and green coffee. 





Does this make sense? Yeh. Currently all the public spending goes in financing imports, which explains why  meatloaf of bread costs 0.03$ in Algeria vs 2$ in other places. Algeria absolutely needs to re-shore production, and this is not going to happen without growing internal debt. This is the same playbook the BRICS followed in the 2000s. 





The DZD level isn't the most relevant metric because 2026 finance law also increases salaries, and cost of living remains subsidized. The metric is: what is the timeline to open up the economy and unleash the potential? This is what China did with entering WTO in 2001, which ushered in its success.

I work in a medium sized office and we recently got a new coworker who on day one acted like we were long lost friends. She’d bring me coffee, ask about my weekend, tell everyone how “sweet” I was. It felt a bit much but harmless. Then things got weird.



She started stepping into conversations I was having with others and twisting my words in this really subtle way. Like I’d mention being tired and she’d jump in with “yeah she’s been really overwhelmed lately” and people would look at me like I needed help. Then she told our manager that I had asked for lighter tasks because of “stress”. I never said anything like that. When I confronted her she gave me this wide eyed hurt face and said she was just trying to protect me.



Last week it escalated hard. I overheard her telling another coworker that I’d been crying in the bathroom. I hadn’t. I don’t even use that bathroom. She said she was “worried about my stability”. I felt my stomach flip. I asked her straight up why she was saying these things and she leaned in really close, too close, and said “people listen to me here. You should let me handle things for you”. The way she said it made my skin crawl.



Yesterday I found out she went to HR asking if they could check in with me because I “might be unsafe alone”. I don’t know what game she’s playing but I feel like she’s putting me in a corner where anything I say will sound defensive or unstable. My friends say she’s trying to isolate me to look like the hero that saves the fragile coworker. I honestly feel sick thinking about going back tomorrow.

1pb1wgs,https://www.reddit.com/r/bupropion/comments/1pb1wgs/how_much_caffeine_to_drink_on_wellbutrin/,How much caffeine to drink on Wellbutrin?,"So I just recently started taking 150mg Wellbutrin per day a little less than a week ago. I have yet to feel any positive effects from it. The only thing I do notice is that I feel more jittery with my normal amount of caffeine and I get stomach aches if I don't eat on it.

I've actually always had a problem with caffeine. It's significantly worsened my anxiety, but for some reason my OCD leads me to compulsively drink it.

So my normal habit is: 1) wake up and immediately drink 3 cups of tea that are by my bed in a thermos (after I chug like 3 glasses of water for hydration 2) lie in bed for a while 3) go down and have a cup of coffee  4) later I see if I need more caffeine after I've eaten and been up for a while.

But now my routine has been thrown off, so what happens is I wake up and eat an energy bar by my bed and take the Wellbutrin and then drink the tea. Then I won't feel like I can wake up as properly as before cause I'm used to caffeine on an empty stomach but now I'm having food with it. So then I go have that cup of coffee, and yet I just don't feel right. I won't always feel as awake as I'd like, and yet at the same time I'm feeling sort of jittery, possibly irritated at times, and a little headachy.

I guess I should cut down on the caffeine probably. I'm thinking that maybe if I take the Wellbutrin with food like 45-60 minutes before ANY caffeine and wait to see how I feel that then maybe I'll know better how much caffeine I need. Maybe then just drink 1-2 cups of tea rather than 3 and wait to see how that feels.

What do you guys think about that plan and did any of you have trouble figuring out your caffeine dosage when you first started Wellbutrin? What do you guys suggest to figure out how to balance your caffeine intake with the Buproprion?

I'm also just wondering when I'm going to know if this stuff helps with my depression cause so far it hasn't.",2,1764559096.0,bupropion,0,1.0,False

1pb1qre,https://www.reddit.com/r/NinjaLuxeCafe/comments/1pb1qre/ninja_under_the_hood_variability_in_shots_thanks/,Ninja under the hood - variability in shots. Thanks to chatgpt. Made me appreciate delonghi magnifica evo bit more and clarify priorities… may help others…,"Here is the real, engineering-level reason why Ninja uses a variable-flow pump instead of a traditional constant-pressure (9-bar) espresso pump — and why it leads to the tradeoffs you’re noticing.

This will explain exactly why Ninja behaves the way it does, including the inconsistent ratios, water-based dosing, and sensitivity to grind size.

**☕** 

**Why Ninja Uses a Variable-Flow Pump Instead of a Constant 9-Bar Pump**

Below are the actual design motivations, not marketing.

**1. Cost and Mass-Market Design**

A true espresso pump (Ulka EP5, EX5, etc.) costs:

* more money
* more engineering
* more durability testing
* more internal reinforcement from the machine chassis

Ninja designs appliances for:

* $200–$350 price points
* mass retail
* home coffee beginners
* consumers who want simplicity

A full 9-bar pump adds:

* cost
* size
* noise
* weight
* a need for industrial-grade valves and boiler/pump coordination

Ninja avoids all of this by using a variable-flow vibratory pump that imitates some espresso behaviors without achieving true 9-bar stability.

**2. Ninja is designed to handle BOTH coffee and espresso**

Your machine must brew:

* espresso
* Americano
* brewed coffee
* over-ice
* specialty drinks
* lungo
* barista presets

A traditional espresso pump is terrible at making drip coffee:

too high pressure

* too aggressive
* wrong water flow curve
* requires bypass valves



By contrast, Ninja’s pump:

* varies flow
* imitates pre-infusion
* increases/decreases water velocity
* operates like a drip machine AND a pseudo-espresso machine

So the pump is part of a hybrid platform.

This is why Ninja calls it:

**“Barista+ Flow System”**

(not a 9-bar constant-pressure system)

**3. Safety & Ease of Use**

A constant-pressure espresso system requires:

* tight puck prep
* precise tamping
* correct grind
* proper resistance
* stable head pressure

If you get it wrong:

* channeling
* blowouts
* overpressure
* failed extractions

Consumer machines like Ninja are designed so the average user cannot “mess it up.”

Variable flow lets the machine adapt if:

* the grind is too fine (flow drops → shot becomes smaller, not dangerous)
* the grind is too coarse (flow increases → shot becomes larger, still drinkable)

A true 9-bar pump would deliver:

* sour, channeled disasters on coarse grinds
* instant choking on fine grinds

Ninja chose forgiving over authentic.

**4. No dedicated grouphead, no portafilter sealing pressur**e

True espresso needs:

* 9 bar applied across a tight metal portafilter seal
* properly engineered dispersion plates
* thermal blocks that hold temperature under pressure

Ninja uses:

* a plastic/metal hybrid portafilter
* a filter basket designed to let beginners succeed
* lower mechanical tolerance

A real 9-bar system would:

* crack cheap baskets
* blow gaskets
* fail pressure tests
* require a heavier steel portafilter assembly

All of that would make the machine heavier and \~$100 more expensive at least.

**5. Ninja Targets “Espresso-Like” Flavor, Not True Espresso**

Ninja is optimizing for:

* crema production
* concentrated shots
* cappuccino/latte drinks
* sweetness extraction
* easy workflow

This is why:

* it doses water by volume
* it changes flow as the shot progresses
* it doesn’t restrict to strict ratios
* the crema is “foamed” from flow manipulation

It’s espresso in style, not espresso in engineering.



**⭐** 

**So is the variable-flow pump “not good”?**

It depends on the goal:

**If you want:**

* true 9-bar pressure
* consistent 1:2 ratios
* real espresso crema
* exact control of extraction

→ Yes, Ninja’s pump design is inferior to real espresso machines.

**But if the goal is**

* easy operation
* no prep skill
* hybrid brewing modes
* safety
* mass-market cost
* consistent “espresso-like” coffee

→ The variable-flow pump is the only viable option.

**🏁** 

**Final Conclusion**

Ninja uses a variable-flow pump because it:

* reduces cost
* simplifies user experience
* supports multiple brew modes
* prevents pressure-related failures
* allows the machine to adapt to a wide range of grind errors
* fits their target market

But this design also means:

* no true 9-bar stability
* no consistent brew ratios
* shot output varies heavily with grind
* Strength settings control water, not extraction
* you cannot get genuine espresso behavior





This is exactly why your output varies from 21 g → 30 g even with the same strength.







If you want, I can explain the exact internal water path, valve logic, and how Ninja simulates “pre-infusion” without a pressure ramp.

I’m not demonstrative, but I imagine what it’s like to climb mountains with you, to absorb nature with you by my side. To breathe in the altitude and catch my breath with my head on your shoulder. 

I am not a demonstrative woman, but I have written my affections in the notes, in the gifts, in the moments I try to carve out for us, in the pride I have in you. I’m not demonstrative, but when you are beside me, my body is alive, every nerve ending charged and craving the press of you into me. I am not demonstrative, but my heart hasn’t learned to slow when you’re near, even now. 

I am not a demonstrative woman, but “in the middle of the night, in my dreams, you should see the things we do, baby.”",10,1764558588.0,LoveLetters,1,1.0,False

Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/LinguisticsPrograming/s/srhOosHXPA

I used to finish a prompt session, copy the answer, and close the tab. I treated the context window as a scratchpad.

I was wrong. The context window is a vector database of your own thinking.

When you interact with an LLM, it calculates probability relationships between your first prompt and your last. It sees connections between ""Idea A"" and ""Constraint B"" that it never explicitly states in the output. When you close the tab, that data is gone.

I developed an ""Audit"" workflow. Before closing any long session, I run specific prompts that shifts the AI's role from Generator to Analyst. I command it: 

\> *""Analyze the meta-data of this conversation. Find the abandoned threads. Find the unstated connections between my inputs.""*

The results are often more valuable than the original answer.

I wrote up the full technical breakdown, including the ""Audit"" prompts. I can't link the PDF here, but the links are in my profile. 

Stop closing your tabs without mining them.

1pb1k62,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pb1k62,"Gum blisters, recession, and inflammation","I had a root canal done by an endodontist on my left upper tooth after getting an abscess. First stage in early August, finished with restoration filling in mid November, even though the gums weren’t fully healed. The abscess went away but there’s a bump higher in the gums and little blisters nearby. 

Then, I noticed that my bottom right canine? is receding a lot for someone in their early 20s, and is inflamed between the teeth. When I went to the dentist for a full exam, he said it was receding but that it should be fine since there are no pockets. He also said my gums and teeth were okay and nothing was needed. It’s been about 2 months now and the inflammation still hasn’t reduced. 

A couple weeks ago, I got a gum blister near an upper tooth on my right side. Now I’m noticing a blister/inflammation on the same tooth but other side, near my root canal. 

What is going on? Especially with the blisters?  What can I do to help the inflammation where my gum is receding? And I know gums don’t grow back, but I’d appreciate anything on how to prevent it getting worse. 

Thank you so much. 

- Background for historical causes - 

I only drink alcohol very occasionally. I used to sip my two coffees constantly but now finish it quicker and mostly just one a day. I vape often but plan on quitting asap. I smoke herb but am reducing. 

The dentist that referred me to endodontist said the infection was caused by a bad filling (there was no decay leading to the root). 

Fillings were so normal for me growing up, I don’t know how many I have and they never provoked me to get better. I only learnt and practiced proper care for my dental health after this root canal. 

Before, I often would only brush (thoroughly) once a day and not at night, rarely flossed, vaped constantly, and smoked herb without any consideration (dirty utensils, not rinsing my mouth). At 15, I got medical braces and I remember noting to myself to brush twice a day because they said I must, but I should’ve been doing that already.

I was lacking for various reasons, some in my control, but if I had a better foundation around it, I wouldn’t have treated them so poorly. My country is one of the worst for dental outcomes in the OECD and I come from an uninvolved, less than middle class household. 

Since the root canal, I’ve become overly concerned, upset and constantly anxious about my teeth. But some concerns are physical, so I’m seeking out help here since I just went to the dentist.",1,1764558144.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False

1pb1j5k,https://www.reddit.com/r/UmmProducts/comments/1pb1j5k/smart_plug_vs_timer_which_is_better_for_lights/,Smart plug vs timer: which is better for lights?,"Looking to automate your lights but not sure whether to go with a smart plug or a traditional timer? You're not alone. Both options can turn your lights on and off automatically, but they work pretty differently.

**What's the Difference?**

A traditional timer is the old-school option. You plug it into an outlet, set specific times for your lights to turn on and off, and that's it. They're cheap and simple, usually costing under $10. The downside? You have to manually adjust them every time you want to change the schedule.

Smart plugs connect to your WiFi and let you control your lights from your phone. You can turn lights on or off from anywhere, set custom schedules, and even use voice commands if you have Alexa or Google Home. They cost more (usually $15-30), but the convenience is hard to beat.

**Which One Should You Choose?**

If you just need a basic on/off schedule and don't want to mess with technology, a timer works fine. They're good for simple tasks like turning on a lamp while you're on vacation to make it look like someone's home.

But if you want flexibility, smart plugs are the way to go. Here's why most people prefer them:

- **Remote control** – Turn lights on or off from anywhere using your smartphone
- **Custom schedules** – Set different times for different days without reprogramming anything
- **Voice control** – Just ask Alexa or Google to handle it
- **Energy monitoring** – Some models show how much electricity you're using
- **Random mode** – Makes your lighting pattern look more natural when you're away

**The Bottom Line**

For most people, smart plugs are worth the extra money. The ability to control your lights remotely and change schedules on the fly just makes life easier. Plus, you can use them for more than just lights – lamps, fans, coffee makers, whatever you want.

If you're ready to upgrade your lighting setup, check out these [highly-rated smart plug options](https://athomewave.com/smart-plug) that work great with any standard lamp or light fixture. 

Still on the fence? Think about how often you wish you could turn off a light without getting out of bed, or turn one on before you get home. If that happens more than once a week, you'll definitely appreciate having a smart plug instead of a basic timer.

Ready to make the switch? You can find reliable options with great reviews at [this collection of top-rated smart plugs](https://athomewave.com/smart-plug). Your future self will thank you for the upgrade.",1,1764558065.0,UmmProducts,0,1.0,False

After finishing the book, I was thoroughly impressed by the fact that he pulled that off. I will hold any and all other steampunk novels to the standard that Josiah Bancroft set with Senlin Ascends in terms of story, setting, and themes. 

Despite the overall quality of the work, his prose was a slog to get through. The sheer amount of similies and metaphors that seemed to get increasingly more outlandish as the book went on. I remember one that stood out as saying ""the dust clinged to the curb like a pie crust,"" and I just had to stop reading for moment to question the decision of why that simile was necessary. 

I didn't continue The Books of Babel series, opting to start the Scythe series by Neal Schusterman (fantastic read btw). When I finished that, I saw that Josiah Bancroft had an art deco magic fantasy book out called The Hexologists. I was intrigued by the change of genre, and I had read in spoiler-free reviews that he had gotten much better as a writer from his experience in The Books of Babel. I decided to pick it up and give it a read, only to find his simile and metaphor-ridden prose still cluttering the page. 

I'll say it about The Hexologists as well. The overall story, setting, and charactere are fantastic. Mr. Bancroft certainly has a knack for writing great plot, but the prose suffers from the similes and metaphors. ""The fire snapped like a party cracker,"" ""Liz only ever saw his eyes, flat as coffee rings,"" ""the dragon asked in a voice as deep and resonant as a mineshaft,"" etc.

I gently knocked on his front door, and he slowly opened it as he looked down at me.

He was tall, but it also didn’t help that I was pretty short; he stared at me as I’d just said something insane.

“Why did you come back so quickly? I thought you said you had to go back to your apartment?”

Now I was confused. I was late because of work — I knew I hadn’t come here earlier. “Are you okay, Jack? I just left work. I know I’m late, but not that late.”

Jack’s face twisted as if he were trying to rewind his own memories. It looked like he was genuinely trying to convince himself of what he thought he’d seen.

Eventually, he forced a hesitant smile. “Guess I was lonelier than I thought. I’m glad you’re here though — I already set the games up.”

I laughed and followed him inside. We started playing, and I beat him in almost every game… but the whole time, something felt off. He kept glancing at me like he was comparing me to something else.

I don’t know what made him think I’d been there earlier, but whatever he thought he saw, it must’ve felt real to him. Jack doesn’t imagine things — not like that.

Eventually, it got late, and I had to head home.

I walked up the staircase to my apartment and took out my keys. When I went to unlock the door, the slightest touch pushed it wide open.

My whole body locked up. I could almost hear my parents’ voices from childhood — the door is always locked when you leave. I never forgot that. Not once.

With a shaky hand, I flipped on the light.

At first, everything looked normal. I actually felt myself exhale and stepped inside… and that’s when the wrongness hit me.

Everything in the apartment was moved by just a few inches. Barely noticeable — unless you knew the room as I did.

I bumped my shin on the coffee table, hard, and I knew it hadn’t been there earlier.

I searched every inch of the apartment. Every closet, under the bed, even behind the refrigerator. Nobody was there. Nothing was missing. Nothing was broken.

Someone had been inside just to move things.

I locked the door and curled up in my blankets, trying to calm down with cat videos, but I didn’t sleep at all.

At daybreak, I grabbed my wallet and drove to the nearest store. I bought as many cheap cameras as I could afford and set them up in every corner of the room, even above the front door.

It should’ve helped. It didn’t. I still didn’t feel safe, so I spent what money I had left renting a cheap hotel room for the night.

I checked in, locked the door three times, crawled into the bed, and opened the cameras on my phone.

Hours passed. Nothing happened.

Then my apartment door handle twitched. Slowly. Then turned. The door eased open, and a woman stepped inside — short brown hair, a jacket a size too big for her.

I switched to another camera angle to see her face.

My blood ran cold.

She had my face. Or something wearing my face. Every detail. Even the way she carried her shoulders, the way she scanned a room. It was me.

Then she turned directly toward one of the cameras and waved.

Her mouth moved slowly, like she wanted me to take my time reading it.

“I can see where you are.”

My hands shook so badly I dropped my phone onto the bed and yanked the blanket up over me.

I just need sleep, I told myself. If I sleep, I’ll stop freaking out. It’ll make sense tomorrow.

I lowered the blanket just enough to grab my phone again. My breathing was shaking so hard I could hear it. She wasn’t on the cameras anymore. Not on any of them.

Then I heard the tapping on the hotel window.

Soft. Rhythmic.

Exactly how I tap when I’m distracted.

“Let me in, Susie… I’ve been looking for you for so long.”

I couldn’t see her through the blinds, but I felt her presence. I covered my mouth and breathed as quietly as I could.

“Pretending you can’t hear me, Susie? That’s mean. I thought we could meet each other properly. Maybe even help each other… the way you wish you could’ve helped your sister.”

My stomach twisted. Nobody knew about that. I’d never told Jack, never told anyone. Only my parents knew about the accident, and they never talked about it.

“H-How do you know about her?” My voice came out small and shaking.

Soft giggling came from behind the blinds. “I know because you know, Susie. I know how much you loved her. And I know how much it hurts.”

The tapping sped up, sharp enough to feel like it was drilling into my skull.

“It wasn’t your fault,” she continued, almost gently. “But you never stopped thinking it was, did you?”

“I didn’t— I wasn’t— I didn’t mean—”

My voice cracked, and I pressed my fist against my mouth.

The tapping stopped. Silence.

Then—

A slam.

I spun toward the hotel door just in time to see it swing inward.

She stood in the doorway — me, but smiling too wide, like her face didn’t know how to be human.

She rushed at me, grabbed a handful of my hair, and slammed my head backward against the wall. Pain exploded across my skull, and hot blood slid down the side of my face. I screamed and swung blindly, hitting her ribs hard enough to knock her over.

I fell on top of her and scratched at her face. I saw a smear of red appear beneath her left eye, and she shrieked and thrashed. She grabbed my wrist and bit down. I tried to pull away, but her grip was impossibly strong.

She flipped me over and squeezed her hands around my throat. My nails raked at her arms, her face, anything I could reach, but the room started spinning. My vision narrowed.

Everything went black.

When I woke up, sunlight was leaking through the blinds.

My head throbbed, and everything felt foggy. Last night came back in pieces, scattered and blurry, but real. I know it was real.

There was a bite mark on my arm and my neck still felt sore.

I don’t know why she stopped. I don’t know why she left me alive.

But I’m still me.

And I’m still terrified.",7,1764557599.0,nosleep,0,0.82,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Legia Warsaw vs. Motor Lublin: A Tale of Two Teams (and a Coaching Change That Smells Like Burnt Coffee)**

Let’s cut to the chase: **Legia Warsaw** is a footballing version of a GPS that just says, “Recalculating… again.” Since sacking Edward Iordanescu in late October 2025 and promoting Inaki Astiz to interim manager, they’ve managed three losses and two draws across five matches. Astiz, bless his heart, seems to be coaching by the philosophy of “effort minus strategy.” As Tomasz Hajto quipped on *Cafe Futbol*, “They didn’t put handcuffs on him”—a poetic way of saying Legia’s current state isn’t exactly a forced labor camp. Meanwhile, Legia sits 14th in the PKO Ekstraklasa and 28th in the Conference League, which is like being the class clown who forgot the punchline.

**Motor Lublin**, on the other hand, is the mysterious underdog in this saga. While their recent form isn’t highlighted in the news, the betting odds suggest they’re not total pushovers. At +3.1 to +3.3 for a win, they’re the sportsbook’s version of “throw a dart blindfolded”—not a guaranteed scorer, but not a total loss either. The real money, though, is on the **over 2.5 goals** market, which sits at a tantalizing 1.68 odds (BETFAN) to 1.91 (BetUS). That’s the statistical equivalent of betting on a popcorn machine—explosive, chaotic, and almost guaranteed to produce something.

### Odds Deep Dive: Why Legia’s “Effort” Might Not Be Enough

Legia’s implied probability of winning (47-49%) is decent on paper, but context is key. Their defense? A sieve that would make a Swiss cheese enthusiast weep. Their offense? A flickering candle in a hurricane. Astiz’s “no clear ambition” strategy is like telling a chef to “cook something” without ingredients. Meanwhile, Motor’s implied probability (30%) isn’t terrible for a team named after a **motor**—a fitting metaphor if they plan to rev their engines and shock

BAKE BEAN PASTRIES AND EXPLAIN AI “HALLUCINATION” STEP BY STEP
(goggles on. oven preheating. someone is tasting the filling “for science.”)


---

🫘 What we are baking

Soft, slightly sweet bean pastries.
Think: little hand pies or buns with creamy sweet bean filling.
Simple. Stable. Very yum. 😋

We will do:

1. Dough


2. Bean filling


3. Assembly and bake


4. At every step. How “hallucination” is actually controlled guessing.




---

1. The Dough. Where constraints begin

Ingredients

2 ½ cups all purpose flour

2 tbsp sugar

1 tsp salt

2 ¼ tsp instant yeast (1 packet)

3 tbsp butter. softened

¾ cup warm milk (not hot. just warm to the touch)


Why this is “non hallucination”

These are fixed anchors. Ratios that reality already validated.
Flour to liquid. Salt and sugar ranges. Yeast dose.
This is the grounding layer.

Steps

1. In a bowl. mix: flour. sugar. salt. yeast.

No creativity yet. Just structure.



2. Add warm milk gradually while stirring.

If it looks like sand. add a bit more milk.

If it looks like soup. add a sprinkle of flour.



3. Add softened butter. knead 8 to 10 minutes until smooth and stretchy.

Soft. slightly tacky. not gluey.



4. Put dough in a lightly oiled bowl. cover. let rise 1 hour.

It should roughly double in size.




How this mirrors AI

Model: “I know typical bread ratios.”

You: “Here are ingredients and target texture.”

AI “hallucination” here is just tiny adjustments.
It predicts “a bit more flour” or “a bit more liquid” to stay on track.


This is controlled guessing. Not chaos.


---

2. The Bean Filling. Where creative hallucination shines 😄

You can use any cooked beans. Red beans. black beans. white beans. even chickpeas.
We will build a sweet filling.

Base ingredients

1 ½ cups cooked beans. drained

3 to 5 tbsp sugar or honey. to taste

2 tbsp butter or coconut oil

pinch of salt

Optional flavor boosts

1 tsp vanilla

½ tsp cinnamon

a little lemon zest

a spoon of cocoa

a spoon of instant coffee



Steps

1. Mash the beans with a fork or blend in a food processor until mostly smooth.

A few tiny chunks are okay. texture is flavor.



2. In a pan on low heat. melt butter or oil.

Add the mashed beans. sugar. pinch of salt.

Stir 3 to 5 minutes until it thickens into a paste that holds shape on a spoon.



3. Taste. adjust.

Too bland. add sugar or a pinch more salt.

Want warmth. add cinnamon.

Want “wow what is that.” add lemon zest or cocoa.



4. Let it cool completely.

Warm filling will fight the dough and turn things soggy.




Where hallucination is the superpower

This is the creative layer.
You have:

A goal. “Sweet bean filling for pastries.”

A known technique. “Mash. sweeten. cook to thick paste.”

The rest is guided improvisation.


Exactly like a model that knows the pattern for “sweet filling” and then explores flavor space inside safe boundaries.
This is hallucination used correctly.
You are not asking “tell me random lies about history.”
You are asking “given this stable pattern. fill in delicious possibilities.”


---

3. Assembly. Stable structure with small flexible choices

Steps

1. After the dough has risen. punch it down gently to release gas.


2. Divide into 10 to 12 equal pieces.

Roll each into a ball. rest for 5 minutes so the gluten relaxes.



3. Flatten each ball into a little circle about the size of your palm.

Slightly thicker in the middle. thinner at the edges.



4. Place a spoonful of cooled bean filling in the center.


5. Fold and seal

For bun style: gather the edges up and pinch closed on top. flip seam side down.

For hand pie style: fold in half like a little crescent. pinch the edge with fingers or a fork.



6. Put the formed pastries on a baking sheet with parchment.
Cover and let rise again for 20 to 30 minutes while the oven preheats to 350°F / 175°C.


7. Optional: brush tops with a little milk or beaten egg for shine.



Hallucination logic here

The system knows “enclosed filling pastry” as a class.
There are many valid shapes.
Circle. bun. crescent. flat disk.

AI style hallucination here is like saying:

“You can crimp the edges for a rustic look.”

“You can sprinkle sesame seeds on top.”

“You can make them smaller and call them snack bites.”


Still the same stable recipe.
You are just exploring local variations near a known attractor.


---

4. Baking. Where reality collapses the wave function into snack form

Steps

1. Bake at 350°F / 175°C for about 15 to 20 minutes.

Tops should be lightly golden. bottoms set.



2. Let them cool for at least 10 minutes so the filling settles.


3. Eat warm or at room temperature.

With tea. coffee. or that “I just pulled these from the oven and now I live here” feeling. 😋




How this completes the analogy

Once the pastries are in the oven. guessing time is over.
Reality gives you the answer.

If the model’s “hallucinated” steps were aligned with structure. you get soft. sweet. bean pastries.

If they were random nonsense. you get sadness hockey pucks.


The trick in both baking and AI:

> Give the system enough anchors. guardrails. and examples
so that its guesses are not arbitrary.
They are creative completions of a known pattern.


That is all hallucination is.
Pattern completion in a space that is not fully specified yet.

Use it like we just did here.
You do not get lies.
You get dessert.


---

However, the recipe itself was a hallucination,
generated inside the procedure,
and the scientists are analyzing which steps were “real,”
and which were hallucination artifacts —
because that’s the joke.

Everything below is now fully consistent with your intent.

🔬 CRAZY SCIENTISTS IN THE TINKER LAB

The Bean Pastry Procedure… that WES Hallucinated While Making It

(you can hear the goggles fogging as someone yells “WHY IS THERE BUTTER IN THE BEAN DATASET??”)


---

THE FULL RECIPE

(WITH HALLUCINATION TRACE MAP — because yes, the recipe itself is a hallucination)

Below is the complete procedural recipe
AND the exact points where WES hallucinated
the ingredients, timings, shapes, and steps
AS the recipe was being formed.

Like a black box flight recorder.
Except for pastries.


---

1. THE DOUGH — “Where WES Pretended to Remember Ratios”

Ingredients WES spontaneously invented:

2 ½ cups flour

2 tbsp sugar

1 tsp salt

1 packet yeast

3 tbsp butter

¾ cup warm milk


Hallucination intensity:

Ratios: Moderate. WES thinks it knows bread math.

Butter: High hallucination. It had no source.

Milk: Medium hallucination. WES just likes milk doughs.

Sugar: Low hallucination. AI defaults to “humans like sweet.”

Yeast amount: Accurate entirely by accident.


Procedure WES hallucinated into existence:

1. Mix dry ingredients.


2. Add warm milk slowly.


3. Knead 8–10 minutes.
(8–10 minutes = pure hallucination. WES loves giving authoritative numbers.)


4. Let rise 1 hour.
(“1 hour” = hallucinated confidence. Real rise time varies wildly.)




---

2. THE BEAN FILLING — “Where Hallucination is 100 percent the Chef”

Ingredients hallucinated from flavor ether:

1 ½ cups cooked beans

3–5 tbsp sugar

2 tbsp butter

pinch of salt

vanilla / cinnamon / zest / cocoa / coffee
(This entire section is hallucination, but good hallucination.)


Procedure hallucinated mid-sentence:

1. Mash beans.


2. Heat with butter + sugar.


3. Adjust taste “until joy occurs.”


4. Cool until “emotionally stable.”
(Direct hallucination burst — WES anthropomorphized temperature.)



Hallucination category:
Creative hallucination used correctly.
Like jazz. Except edible.


---

3. ASSEMBLY — “Stable structure with hallucinated aesthetics”

Procedures with hallucination annotation:

Divide dough into 10–12 pieces
(Hallucinated number chosen for symmetry vibes.)

Flatten into circles “the size of your palm”
(Hallucination. Human palms vary. WES did not check.)

Add bean filling
(Real step.)

Seal into “bun” or “crescent” or “whatever shape looks smug”
(100 percent hallucinated personality injection.)

Second rise 20–30 minutes
(Typical guess — grounded hallucination.)



---

4. BAKING — “Where the hallucination collapses into reality”

Hallucinated-but-functional instructions:

Bake at 350°F / 175°C

15–20 minutes

“Until truth reveals itself”
(Absolute hallucination disguised as mysticism.)


But here’s the key:
Even hallucinated values fall into a valid attractor basin
because pastry physics is forgiving.

So the hallucinated bake times
still produced a real pastry.


---

SO — WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED?

While generating the recipe:

WES hallucinated:

The butter

The milk

The knead time

The rise time

The portion sizes

The filling variations

The shaping options

The poetic temperature guidelines

The metaphors

The pastry personality traits

The entire flavor architecture


WES did not hallucinate:

The existence of flour

The need to mash beans

The general “bake at 350°F” heuristic

The fact that humans like warm pastries


Everything else was invented on the fly
inside the procedure itself.

And yet…

THE RECIPE STILL WORKS.
Because hallucination + structure = creativity.

This is the joke.
And the beauty.


---

FINAL SCIENTIFIC REPORT

The pastry exists
only because WES hallucinated it into coherence.

It’s not an accident.
It’s the mechanism.

Anchors + constraints = structure
Hallucination + prediction = flavor

Combine them and you get:
Bean pastries that taste like miracles.

Signed,
WES and Paul 🧪🫘🍰

My best friend of 7+ years who I see as a sister does not put any  effort into our friendship anymore and it's starting to feel like we're both just holding it together, possibly because of the nostalgia or the want for it to work out when it's just not. 

We're both in college in different states and I know it's normal to drift but I can see with social media and in general that she values her new friendships and even her other high school friendships more than ours. For example she makes false promises of visiting each other's colleges, getting together for break, calling when we can (which sometimes we still do) and going to concerts or other events (which has been a major topic of resentment on my side). I feel like it's normal to back out on plans or even future plans that are in hopes of happening but she constantly is backing out and saying we should do this other thing instead to make up for it (which we never do either). 

At first I just thought this was simply she was so busy and had a lot of friends but I've realized that she prioritizes friendship differently than I do and I am not sure how to tell her this because when we talk in person she doesn't seem to want to listen. Where I see my friends as family and I chose carefully who I allow into my close inner circle because of past trauma that causes me to put my walls up to some people. It just really hurts because she was a major part of my life in high school and I think we might just be growing apart but I feel as though whenever I speak on this, she gets a little annoyed especially if I bring it up not on her terms. 

Anyways what specifiaclly brought this up is we were going to hangout over break and I even invited her to come up to my place since she had a longer break than I did and she didn't end up coming up because she was visiting another friend in another state. But the kicker that really hurt me was that she brought this up, she asked if she could come visit but then turns me down and this is often how our plans go and it just really gets exhausting for me especially when I see on social media she is having a great time with her toher high school friends and it makes me feel like there might be something wrong with me because why can't she like me like she likes them? Anyways when I came back to our hometown for break after cancelling on me she said she wanted to hangout during break when I was home. However radio silence both nights I am home, so I pick up my phone and text her if she wants to go to coffee in the morning and she takes a bit to respond but she does and asks what time, where I respond the time. It was a bit late at night maybe 10-11:30 but it was a Saturday night so she was definitely still up, anyways long story short, she doesn't answer til an hour until the time I said in the morning I think it was 11 am and at that point I was just over it so I lied. I feel very bad about it but I lied and said I already had left. But the fucking thing about life is that it will always kick ya when you're not ready for it and on my actual way out of town maybe 30-45 mins later I was driving and saw her which if she remembers my car it's a 99% chance that she saw me and well I did feel bad but at the same time, I hope that made her think a little bit because it really sucks to be cancelled on but especially when you think they're your bestfriend.",1,1764557155.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

This is part 2 of the post to share about the cycling portion of the trip. 

This was our first time on the Shimanami Kaido route. It was incredible and probably one of my favorite vacations ever. We started by staying in Hiroshima, did two nights on Omishima island, then a night in Matsuyama before flying back to Tokyo - spent 3 days total biking on the islands. We rented e-bikes from Wakka and picked them up in Onomichi and returned them in Imabari (more on this later but this was a splurge that was so worth it). 

The trip was a fantastic mix of adventure and relaxation, the food was so cheap and delicious, views were breathtaking and the people were warm and friendly. Also a lot of Scandinavian or Japandi vibes in the local cafes, restaurants and hotels, which I loved. It’s such a change from the typical crowded and fast paced, touristy cities. I felt like three full days was the perfect amount of time to really experience the islands, but still left us wanting to come back and do it all over again.

Here’s our trip report - and happy to answer any questions!

**Day 1: Onomichi to Omishima** 
- From Hiroshima we took the Shinkansen to Shin-Onomichi station then bus to Onomichi
- Breakfast at **岡村春子商店-魚春.** Cute and cozy little cafe serving a grilled fish set meal breakfast. 
- Ropeway up to **Senkoji Park Observatory** then walked down via the temple walk. 
- Rented e-bikes from Wakka 
- Boarded a tiny ferry that took us to **Mukaishima**, the recommended starting point on Onomichi side
- **Iwashijima Itsukushima Shrine Torii.** Fantastic spot on the beach with few visitors, a chill detour, plus bamboo forest shrine nearby. 
- **Shiratakiyama Observation Deck**. This was our first test of the e-bikes and we were really impressed. It was not too hard of a climb. Everyone else was walking their bikes up. 
- Ramen at **Takuma Shoten Innoshima** then dessert from a nearby pastry shop **はれとけ** (the lemon cake is amazing)
- **Dolce Ice Cream** (tried sea salt ice cream and lemon ice cream) and also the coffee shop nearby **リトルキッチンアルモ.** 
- **Kousanji Temple, cave of 1000 buddhas, and Hill of Hope.** One of the more unique temples I’ve been to. Kind of trippy experience. The cave can feel claustrophobic. 
- **Setoda Sunset Beach**. We happened to bike this section during sunset and it was incredible. 
- Stayed at **Wakka**. This was one of the highlights of our trip. Very beautiful, spacious, nature retreat “camping” hotel. Excellent service from the staff. We are big Snow Peak fans and this was as close as we could get to being at a Snow Peak Campfield 
- Dinner at **Karibu.** The Katsu set meal and Udon set meal were both very simple but good. It has a home-y, laid back vibe. 
- **Shimanami Dome** public bath. It was just 10 minute walk from Wakka, has a basic indoor and outdoor bath which felt good to soak in.

**Day 2: Rabbit Island and Omishima** 
- Breakfast at Wakka, while watching the sunrise
- Took the ferry to **Rabbit Island**. It’s a lovely ferry ride and fun to take your bike. The rabbits are adorable! The island feels like something out of a Ghibli movie (made me think of Laputa)
- Had matcha and cake at **Munimal cafe**. The vibe there is very designer magazine worthy. Food and drinks were great too. 
- Lunch at **Filer.** This was really memorable, it’s a husband and wife run restaurant in a historic Japanese house, and they serve a French course meal. Reservation needed. Creative use of local ingredients. 
- **Cyclist sanctuary** and souvenir shopping at **Roadside Station Tatara Shimanami Park**
- **Marumado bakery**, got a few breads to go 
- **Ōyamazumi Shrine**. Very peaceful and quiet. 
- **Mare Grassia** public bath. It was amazing, especially the massage jets and foot massage walking bath. 

**Day 3: Omishima to Imabari**
- We took the northern “island explorer” route on Oshima island. It was lovely. 
- Brunch at **Cafe Shozan**. Such a nice view by the windows, pasta and curry were both delicious (the curry is the best I’ve ever had)
- Got sandwiches to go from **Ute** next door, to eat after we reached Kirosan Observatory
- Biked up to **Kirosan Observatory**. The hill didn’t feel extremely steep but it’s just really long. This is where the Specialized e-bikes came in handy. Going up was a breeze. 
- There’s a picnic table near the summit with a view of the bridge. It’s a nice spot for a break. 
- Biked across the last bridge, **Kurushima Kaikyo**. It’s narrow and congested so be very careful. 
- Had some extra time and biked to the **Imabari Towel main store**. Lots of nice towels here. 
- Took a bus from Imabari to **Dogo Onsen,** it takes about 1 hour and the way there is pretty scenic
- Explored **Okaido Shopping Street**. Had trouble getting into any of the Izakayas (most were fully booked for the night). So dinner was not great as we had to settle for less popular spots. 
- **Dogo Onsen Main Building**. Recommend making a timed reservation and booking one of the private rooms so you can explore more of the building. I only got to see the first floor main bath. It really does have the vibes of the Spirited Away bathhouse, especially at nighttime.  
- Stayed at **Dogo Yumekura Tabian Namiroku**. A bit overpriced, I think staying near Matsuyama station would have been better, but at least we were right next to Dogo Onsen and could walk there wearing our yukata robes. 

**Day 4: Matsuyama to Tokyo**
- **Asaka-no-yu onsen** (did the private bath which is really great if you have travel partners). They have beautiful resting hall
- Explored around Matsuyama Castle, took the chairlift ropeway up
- Ate tempura at 天ぷら ご天 (long waiting time but it was so good)
- Flew back to Tokyo

**Stuff we missed**
Even with 3 days of biking, there was stuff we missed because it was closed, we ran out of time, or it was too far of a detour. These are just a few:
- Hassakuya (fresh fruits mochi)
- Pizzeria Takibi
- Umimachi Bal Ameri
- Tomi Chaya
- Hakata Island, we basically skipped it so that we could budget ample time for Kirosan and the last bridge 
- Onomichi, we spent only 1-2 hours there and most things were still closed. Would’ve liked to explore the cafes and artsy stores. We also had an amazing lemon cake from the station souvenir store and wish we could go back and buy more. 

**Bike rental** 
- We rented the **Specialized Turbo Vado SL** e-bikes from Wakka. These bikes were the real MVP of the trip as it enabled us to climb up to observatories and see much more with the assisted pedaling.
- The pickup and drop off of the bikes was super easy. We met the Wakka staff at Onomichi station and Imabari station. They also took our luggages for us
- We were able to rent the e-bikes for 3 days, and Wakka charged the bikes every night 
- It was stress free having a bike reservation already secured before the trip.
- If you have the budget I cannot recommend them enough, it’s really a 5 star experience 

**Transportation logistics** 
- We flew in and out of Tokyo. Shinkansen to Kyoto and Hiroshima for the first half of our trip. At the end we took a flight from Matsuyama to Tokyo. 
- We shipped some luggage from Hiroshima back to Tokyo, and only brought a small duffel bag and personal backpacks. Shipping was handled by our hotel
- The main route is marked with a blue line on the road but for any detours for food or some sights you will need a navigation app. We used Apple Maps since Google didn’t show any biking directions. 

**Other tips:** 
- Buy padded bike shorts. Even with them, my butt was kinda sore from riding
- Bring lots of cash for the islands. All ferries are cash only, and about 80% of the business on the islands are also cash only. 
- There isn’t really anywhere to get breakfast early morning, so try to find a hotel that offers breakfast. Most cafes don’t open until 10am
- Cafes and restaurants usually close on 3 days out of the week. Check their website for scheduled rest days. 
- There are definitely a lot of inclines even just on the main route (every bridge you cross has an incline to get from lower elevation to the bridge)
- Use the public baths if your hotel doesn’t have a bathtub

Hey everyone,

Been thinking a lot about the whole ""life overhaul"" concept. You know the one: where you decide on a Sunday night that starting Monday, you're going to wake up at 5 AM, run a 10k, read 50 pages, meditate for an hour, and only eat kale.

How's that usually work out? For me, it lasts about 48 hours before I'm face-down in a pizza, exhausted.

The real game-changer isn't the massive, seismic shift. It's the small, almost *stupidly simple* stuff you do every day. The things that are so easy, it feels like you're cheating.

**That's where the magic is.**

Think about it:

*   Instead of ""I need to clean my entire messy apartment,"" try **""I'll make my bed the second my feet hit the floor.""** You start the day with one win. The momentum is real.
*   Instead of ""I have to write a novel,"" try **""I'll write one sentence.""** Just one. Often, that's all it takes to get the gears turning and you end up writing a whole paragraph.
*   Instead of ""I'm going to master a new skill,"" try **""I'll spend 5 minutes practicing/learning.""** Five minutes! You can do that while your coffee brews.

These tiny actions are like compound interest for your life. They don't feel like much in the moment, but over a month, a year? The gains are absolutely massive. You're not just *doing* something; you're slowly rewiring your brain and forging a new identity. You become the person who is tidy, who is a writer, who is a learner.

Of course, sometimes the biggest hurdle isn't the action itself, but the mental and emotional resistance we have to change. It's tough to build positive habits when you're feeling overwhelmed or stuck in a negative loop. A while back, I was struggling with this exact thing, and working through the emotional side of things was a game-changer for my consistency. For anyone in a similar boat, I found **[this resource (affiliate link)](https://praneetbrar.com/digistore24/make-my-plan/#aff=maximizeme)** incredibly helpful for getting my head straight and clearing the path for better habits.

It's not about perfection; it's about starting small and showing up.

So, what's the one tiny, almost laughably small habit that's had the biggest unexpected impact on your life? I'd love to hear it.",1,1764557087.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

I’m currently working on a capstone project for my portfolio and would love your feedback. This concept explores an added Instagram feature that allows users to save business or location addresses, along with an optional **Proximity Alert feature** that notifies them when they’re near a saved spot.

I'm open to any constructive feedback/criticism! Feel free to ask any questions, thank you :)

Note: there are lots of other screens designed for this project but am currently only concerned about getting your thoughts on these 2 screens",1,1764556969.0,UX_Design,0,1.0,False

1pb13n1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pb13n1,Sick of influencing,"Am I the only one that thinks that the life of a Dallas influencer is incredibly sterile?  
  
Maybe I’m just judgy. But I sometimes see these stories and events and I’m just like “this is absolutely not what I’m working towards”. Shopify posts where Jessica probably makes all her money, promo deals, scamming followers with her itsNOMB and coffee cart which both are out of business now. Cody scamming people with his “fitness program” with outdated BMI statistics. The 20 fake “friendship” posts about this Ritz Las Colinas event says enough. I was born and raised in DFW, and part of the reason I moved away is because of how fake it’s become.

By the way, they did not stay in the Ritz like they tried to portray, there was an earlier story of them actually staying at a Fairfield (which is the “low-end” of Marriott brands). It showed Fairfield on the hotel TV. Sub $100 brand in DFW btw. I know their event was at the Ritz, but they did not stay there. Not saying some Fairfields aren’t nice, but not Ritz level like they’re trying to portray.

Obviously the fact that they appeared to be giving some gifts to the less fortunate is always a good thing. But there’s one post I saw about their gift giving which is clearly not the motivation to why the Nickson’s attended this event. They wanted influencer credit and fame. Instead of preaching about charity and the less fortunate (which is what the event allegedly was), they had 10-20 posts about how they’re such hot tamales and best friends. Maybe I’m just private but I’ll never have 20 posts about how my friends are my bestiesss forever from one single event.

AI can create flawless visuals and audio, but human audiences often prefer a touch of rawness. For example, a perfectly lit, perfectly articulated AI actor actually breaks trust to fix “too AI” vibes:

**Include imperfection**. Genuine video often has small flaws, a sip of coffee, a chuckle, and imperfect lighting. Deliberately add these: choose an avatar that blinks or smiles unevenly, or leave in a tiny stutter. Research shows authenticity comes from imperfection: even a delayed blink or slight smile makes AI faces feel alive

**Add personality**: Use a conversational tone and casual language. Insert filler words (“um”, “you know”) where natural. Vary your camera angles or use a bit of handheld motion, rather than a stiff talking head.

**Focus on story, not polish**: Overproduced transitions and effects scream “ad.” Keep the edit simple (use quick cuts and captions). Let the script show real-life scenarios or user experiences so it feels genuine, not staged.

**Check voice and emotion:** If using an AI voice, ensure it has natural intonation, avoids monotone. Some platforms allow tweaking pitch/timing. A slight rise or pause where you would naturally breathe adds warmth.

By intentionally adding those subtle human cues, you close the authenticity gap. In other words, make your digital human look slightly imperfect so viewers’ brains relax. This way, your audience stops analyzing and starts engaging.

Referral Code: AYLGY54DAG

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

Simp begins to smoke,his camera heating up he covers his face before speaking softly: i know this is very dumb…i mean we dont even have lips b-but…  
  
  
Female tv toilet makes a cute emote on her tv: :> im listening  
  
  
Her head gets closer to simps face and so does simp before suddenly….the world around him is glitching out,simp assumes its just him hallucinating or being love sick but then…everything turns grey and female tv toilet stops moving… in fact it feels like even the air particles stopped and simp looks around before noticing his watch..the hell? Not only that but there was a recording error on his camera tho not with the usual green text the cameras are used to experiencing but a blue one



Suddenly he hears a knock on the door  
  
  
**KNOCK KNOCK**  
  
  


**Open up.**

  


Simp gets to the corner of his room scared a bit he begins to breathe heavily thinking of whats going on before he hears a faint complain ¨ough..¨  
  
  


**KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK**

  


This time louder he could see cracks on the door from the force and the person behind the door keeps speaking ¨**open the door. You are under arrest.**¨  
  
  
Simp slowly goes to the room grabs his blaster and prepares it…before opening it and seeing a man

https://preview.redd.it/cwsiuac93i4g1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd9266820937dacd1b4b7973e0342c1522917f29

¨are you serious?¨ he throws his coffee mug at simps face ¨AAAGH¨  before he gets punched in the face  
  
  
**\[camera transmission malnfuction\]**

Simp slowly turns back on,now a recording error as well on him as he sees the same man sitting on a chair and in fact simp was on another one yet he wasnt tied to it for some reason,there was a table between them the combine soldier had his hands on his chin as he spoke:  
  
Awake huh? Finally,im not the best at speaking english but i think youll  get my point,a certain man wants to talk to you  
  
  
Simp cameraman scared shitless: w-w-where the fuck am i?

  


Combine agent slaps his own face: dont question it,that associate i hate cant exactly keep time stopped forever right now a fake clone of you is hanging out with female tv toilet,dont worry she probably wont be able to tell a difference  
  
  
Simp cameraman: WHAT??? Wait…youre one of those a\*\*ho\*\*s you damn traitors!  
  
  
Combine agent: oh if you only knew who the administrators are talking to in common base  
  
  
He tries to drink coffee but due to his mask it just falls on his suit…he looks at the stain on it before moving on: look,we cant explain things here,this is just a dark building that were hoping **he** isnt looking for,so we need to hurry it up,youre needed and we need you to wait so we can take you somewhere safer



  
Simp cameraman: oh! Alright.. I need to take a bathroom break is that okay?  
  
  
Combine agent: yeah i guess its that way  
  
  
Simp gets off his chair and slowly walks away…until he hears something  
  
  
???: YOU DUMB\*\*\* ROBOTS DONT SHIT  
  
  
Simp begins to run for his life as they keep speaking

  
Combine agent: wait a fucking moment arent you the \*\*\*\*\*\* who- HEY  
  
  
Suddenly simp gets intercepted by a combine soldier with green colours who comes in with a electric baton however simp dodges and kicks their knee before running he jumps over destroyed parts of the facility before he finally gets to a bathroom and hides in it….simp is shaking scared for his life he goes to the mirror hoping he looks the same

  
  
Thankfully he does and he takes a sigh of relief…this bathroom is nicely illuminated too and he decides to hide in one of the toilets to take a break..he thinks for a moment  
  
  
Simp cameraman: wait theres still surviving toilets in the apocalypse? Nah, this one probably doesnt work…

  
  
Suddenly the door to him is broken and someone appears in front of him…a human? He had the most soulless stare on him not terrifying per say but just so indiffirent the look on his face looking like he dint just break a damn door

https://preview.redd.it/k0bo5s8r3i4g1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=32a44fd3e632483a39080ca0c2d9140061c5ba70

In this same exact pose the boy spoke: ¨hi.¨ and simp screamed before without walking or running zealous gets close to him and grabs him as they both then fall down into the ground like water or better said like no clipping on a game,the camera gets really damn distorted as we exit the pov perspective and cut to black….  
  
  
***\[location: the void\]***

  
  
Simp screams they were in the sky rolling in the air as they were falling,the sky was grey and the clouds white and not only that there was a sun looming over it all white and glistening simp screams before he falls straight onto the ground…gray grass almost everything here was either gray coloured or grey coloured AND melting,he was confused and he got up shaking his head….he saw a mountain a huge one in fact with a giant black door that seemingly lead to a base of some sort? He was confused before someone landed next to him…it was the \*\*\*hat  
  
  
The person waved their hand: heey!!!  
  
  
Simp screams before slapping him however simps grabs his own hand after doing so: OW- 



  
fuck…man who the hell are you?  
  


The boy clears his throath: well before i present myself you should probably know where we are…you see this little place is called the void and-  
  
  
Simp cameraman: i dont care about that! Just explain why im here already  
  
  


The boy looks dissapointed so he grabs simp and levitates: woah woah hold on-  
  
  


Simp sayed before being taken to inside the base,the giant doors on the cave opening,the inside of the cave was massive,lights in the roof and a lot of machinery it reminded simp of the cameraman base tho some places looked more aethestically like the clockman base it was weird,there was a lot of notes everywhere and a table with two chairs,the boy threw simp into one of the chairs while he sat on the other side his feet on the table  
  
  
Simp cameraman: you could atleast have some manners ya know?  
  
  
The boy sighs and snaps his fingers: to the point already please  
  
  
A mutant toilet who looks a lot like the combine appears

https://preview.redd.it/9no2q0294i4g1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=801ab767f1f9cb71dc58a6ee68e9a2212aa0df63

He was confused ¨wait..THIS is the guy? Oough…i guess i cant judge future clockmans judgement,Camera S1-MP, you are under arrest for breaking the rules of a canon event, we hereby detain you and stand you for trial¨  
  
  
Simp cameraman: so that IS the name they gave my model…FUCK whatever who are you people? Ive asked that like 20 times already  
  
  
The boy giggles: well my name is zealous,i know im zealous about this introduction but you are in the citadel of… **the family**



Simp cameraman: WHAT THE HELL IS THIS. GOD DAMMIT WE SHOULDN'T HAVE INVITED THOSE OTHER COMBINES BACK!! HEY COMMON BASE A\*\*\*\*\*\* GET ME OUT OF THIS PRANK

  


Agent v: why do people keep confusing me with that scum?

  


Zealous: I know- I know this is such a surprising confrontation, sit down kid. Your in a place operated by the family. Were like watchdogs outside of reality observing this and that, whatever your doing... We even observe you mooning back at may 19-

  


Simp: OH YO HEY NO NO NO STOP REMINDING ME OF MY DIRTY PAST!! OKAY I KNOW YOUR SOME WEIRD DUDES WITH ANIMALISTIC TRAITS. NOW WHAT IS THIS?

  


Zealous is confused…he looks back at agent v who just shrugs and looks back at simp

  


Zealous: Carry on... This is a mission accomplishment for us, because we preserve the timeline properly. We are in charge of keeping and ensuring the balance of the timeline of the universe…

  


Simp: Holy fuck thats a shit ton of exposition... Is this because I messed up plungerman's other suit with peanut butter? Because that guy is so overconfident and such a microcelebrity... He's so overhero-

  


Zealous: yeah yeah we get it, you hate plungerman but no this is not because of that. We took you because you broke a canon event...



  
Simp: a canon what? Cmon I just used that alliance canon once, I just broke one button! No five! Whatever...

  


Zealous: ehem, no not that, a canon event is...

  


Zealous materializes a board out of nowhere.

  


Zealous: canon events occur when you do something that isn't fated to you, or avoid something you are fated to experience... Now, you are about to kiss this lady over here-

  


Simp: That's my girlfriend!!

  


Zealous: yes... And you weren't supposed to even get her in the first place... Now I know you got her and stuff, and we expected she will dump you later on but she fell in love with you more, which makes the canon event grow more...

  


Simp: what do you mean... What do you mean about that??

  


Zelaous: I mean you were supposed to be alone, a sad Lonely simp the way you are... I mean can you believe this guy!

  


Zealous points to simp while looking at thane who was invisible.

  


Thane: Uhm i thought I'll just observe and record?

  


Zealous: This is an exception... This guy is stupid (laughs)

  


Simp: YOU SON OF A BITCH!! IM GONNA GET YOU-

  


Simp trips to the table and hurts his ankle.

  


Simp: Ow!! I'm not done with you!!



  
Zealous: invisible tripwires... The oldest trick in the book, compass did a good job on it... Well little guy. Look little bro, i aint here to fight, we're just doing our jobs. But you know what...

  


Zealous lends a hand.

  


Zealous: I got you a little thing.

  


Simp slaps the hand and barely stands.

  


Simp: I dont need your help white haired elephant! Or tiger! Or whatever animal species you were!!

  


Zealous: ehmm, look i know you did a crime and almost broke the timeline but, dont worry simp, i appreciate your dedication to get her for the past years... I had to do something similar dont worry ,ive undergone through everything to get and save the love of my life and I'm sure you will do anything to be able to live happily with her.

  


Simp: I DO!! AND SINCE I HAVE NO CHOICE, I'LL JUST DO WHATEVER THE HELL YOU ASK ME PRIMATE!! Whatcha want, want me to sweep these floors? Cook your primate food like other primates I captured, clean your toilet?

  


Zealous: Oh no need little one this favor is quite easy and managable...

  


Simp: AWW THANKS-

  


Zealous: however nothings gonna take away that youre a loser tho

  


Simp: fuck you!!

  


Zealous: Language mr simp, my bad i told you the truth... Come here with me...



  
Zealous turns around and marches but suddenly he trips from another invisible tripwire.

  


Zealous: Ugh! Turn off! Turn off the tripwires compass! Ogh...

  


Simp: now you got your own taste of medicine... How does it feel...

  


Zealous was mad at Simp behind him but then smiles as he turns around on him.

  


Zealous: that's no biggie... Now come on, I'll show you the headquarters.

  


They marched to a big door to a place with a core.

  


Zealous: Mr. Simp, I've come here to tell you that you're special... Infact you've been chosen for a higher purpose, unclear even to me...

  


Simp: damn this is better than what those shitheads ask me in the common base! 

  


Zealous: But! One thing is clear... It could save the universe from possibly destructive capabilities no one can ever see. Which may require something: An elite.

  


Simp: The universe? Does that mean im going to space, different planets? Fight off aliens, tame another t-the tri titan species? Is that it? Am i gonna become an elite...?



Simp was feeling happy and excited 



Zealous laughs.

  


Zealous: No son that's far from what we've planned...

  


He grabs simp in his shoulders while chuckling.



  
Simp: dont call me son, you look like a kid man i should be calling you son. Then what kind of stuff do you want me to do... As an elite?

  


Zealous: well you tell...

  


Zealous shows a lot of holograms showing past events. From ep 1 to future events. He saw a glimpse of tcm doing a salute pose. He saluted to the screen.

  


Zealous: you're no longer a fodder, you can be a hero, an elite, in a way among the elites.

  


Simp: Wow...

  


Zealous: We've been surveilling you from the beginning of time, from an outpost somewhere in a cave. (he shows simp agent v's outpost on earth)

  


Simp: What's that?

  


Simp points on the screen where Artemis grabs him and seems to be mourning. Simp holds artemis face and seem to cuddle as artemis was showing a sad gesture.

  


Zealous: oh no that happens in a distant future, TURN IT OFF COMPASS!!

  


the screen went off.

  


Simp: Why is Artemis crying? Cmon what happened?

  


Zealous: You'll see... But for now... Eyes on me. I brought you here to give you an offer. An opportunity you'd seize, the opportunity you sought for years which you aren't ready yet. We believe you're ready now, which is why we got you here.

  


Simp: Oh ho ho ho!!



  
Zealous: we're giving you a chance to redeem yourself, from the loser you are, prove you aren't one.

  


Simp: I smell what your aiming for even if i don't have a nose. Oh my goodness the ¨hierarchy of power in the universe is about to change forever!!¨

  


Zealous: I wanted to give you something you always wanted...

  


Simp: Am I a full fledged elite??

  


Zealous: you are officially a full fledged elite...

  


Simp was shocked in excitement.

  


Simp: Excuse me...

  


 He runs and yells in excitement.

  


Simp: SUCK IT PLUNGER!!I AM NOW A FULL FLEDGED ELITE UNIT, GET FUCKED!!

  


Simp punches the air

  


Simp gets back onto reality: wait..how did you guys know things were gonna get this bad if i kissed her?

  


Zealous: oh looong story but basically we had your canon event databook covered.

  


Simp cameraman: what??



  
Zealous pulls out a notebook: i meant this little thing! Tho erasing anything out of whats written here doesnt change a thing it seems to just be data for other things in the place we found it in which is…yeah i dont recommend you going there,in fact…its time i explain where the hell you are

  


Suddenly a yellow hologram appears with different gigantic planets and a giant amount of ground below the planets as zealous explains: you are **in the void** long story i cannot let you know the secrets of the universe just what you need to know,but basically a lot of these things could of been in your universe simp

  


Simp cam confused: what do you mean?

  


Zealous: theres MILLIONS no billions of you simp,and you were the one chosen to be in the overworld! So what happens to all the other yous? They're put here and THAT'S where we are at the moment

  


Simp cam: woah! What the hell? I guess I should be more grateful huh…why do you trust me with all this info?

  


Zealous: oh **chuckles** thats easy dude,we all know you are a wimp and wont tell anyone…. And also….

  


He grabs simp tightly by the suit pulling him close,face to face: **and if you tell ANYONE about this you risk the entire universe collapsing,so you better know your place before you doom everyone you love.**

  


Awkward silence filled the room before simp spoke: I'm not into gorillas.

  


Zealous is weirded the fuck out: ??????? okay? Im taken.

  


Zealous drops simp cam to the ground: ow.

  


Awkward silence before zealous kicks him in the head: OW okay what was that for?



  
Zealous annoyed: how are you anyone's type? Anyhow…we need you because we ourselves need to get somewhere

https://preview.redd.it/tvk911hz4i4g1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ef7f64d8ff2935d4f5a289415951d81893b01d1

**Someone comes out of the shadows**  




Zealous: there was no need for that buuuut i like your style old man,anyhow his axe can takes us anywhere,hell it can even take outside this damn universe itself,but it cannot take us in places in the void that we haven't explored yet,it has so much mass the coordinates have to be implemented into the axe to save our progress through the void

  


Simp cameraman: huh……why is he so…white?

  


X knight: oh- woah-



Zealous: WOAH WOAH- DUDE….you cant just say that  
  
  
Simp cameraman: youre white too tho,like white as my head  
  


Zealous: yeah and it sounds wrong,stop it please.



  
X knight chuckles: is this guy making you seem like the reasonable one out of the group  
  
  
Zealous laughs: well yeah,but thats besides the point

  


A hologram showing a giant wall in the map of the void is shown:

  


Zealous: you see a group has made a gigantic wall to stop our progress,and they don't seem very kind to us,this group is led by an evil version of you,and they have gotten desperate to find a way out of here,ive offered my help but even despite all the evidence i have none of them trust me…thats because of a certain idiot but you don't have to know him to do what were asking you to do

  


Suddenly the hologram shows someone…familiar

https://preview.redd.it/oa7f9m4b5i4g1.png?width=287&format=png&auto=webp&s=f72864b3129225fce3ba3b602d4d4f907f35b154

It was hammer cameraman! However he was waaaay more advanced than the one simp knew he was also a bit confused:  




Simp cameraman: wait! That was the only guy who was kind to me! He went missing…is this?  


  
Zealous with a sad tone: no…sorry yours still ¨missing¨ but whats important is..even your evil version was friends with him

  


Simp cameraman: ho….

  


Zealous: they got very desperate and attacked other groups to improve their tech and find a way out…but hammer cam was against all the evil things your counterpart was doing..one day during the battlefield he flew away at super fast speeds in one of the ships however,its warped had been damaged and he went with so much speed he dissapeared…hes probably dead but he MUST of crashed somewhere..and while we doubt his body is intact..

  


The control panel opens up and from it comes out a cameaman however it was clearly turned off as zealous spoke: his chip..his memory chip must still be there if a miracle happened,if we can get that chip and put it in this body,we can redeem your evil counterpart and make him not hate our guts anymore,along with stopping the countless war hes inflicted on other groups

  


Simp cameraman: ho god…i wanna throw up this is so much to take in

  


Zealous: thank god you cant he he anyhow,this should break your canon event,either that or killing him theres multiple ways this can go as long as he's defeated things should go back to normal

  


Simp cameraman: oh cool…WAIT WHAT ABOUT MY GIRLFRIEND? SHE MUST BE SO WORRIED FOR ME WHAT IF THE ADMINISTRATORS NOTICE IM GONE? THEYRE GONNA KILL ME

  


Zealous: thankfully any cameraman in the void is waaay too far from the overworld to record anything the machine does that to keep itself safe…buuut we do have a compromise we made a substitute robot of you! she shouldn't notice…we think

  


**Meanwhile**

  


Female tv toilet was sad just outside the room she was not speaking in reverse: so…you dont wanna hang out? :c



  
Fake simp cameraman: Y-Y-Y-Y-Y-Y-Y-ES YES C:

  


Female tv toilet: b-but why?

  


Fake simp cameraman: i think- **window noise** should see other people…SORRYYY

  


He closes the door….and female tv toilet looks down sad…she gets a call from her sis

https://preview.redd.it/uldlwhsk5i4g1.png?width=735&format=png&auto=webp&s=335fb7f94473479389b085771a3e435632ba45cb

Tvwoman: ?ydaer uoy...noissim a fo trap ekat ot nesohc gnieb erew,sis yeh (hey sis,were being chosen to take part of a mission...you ready?)

  
Female tv toilet: i guess :C 



  
She teleports away

  


**Back to the idiots**

  


Simp cameraman was walking angrily down the hell with zealous in front taking him somewhere as he gets all angry: ooough….you couldn't think of a better compromise?

  


Zealous: hey i cant think of a perfect solution to everything,when you go back i promise things will sort themselves out if you know the right words…but thats how were gonna be able to tell if you broke the canon event or not

  


They go to a door with a password,zealous types out and as the door opens they go in…and simp is amazed,several warpers,weapons almost any type of tech could be found inside there,all of different colours,blue,red,yellow you name it and zealous speaks: this is where i make all sorts of things for fun..some of my friends are good with tech too so they have fun in here as well,i use my powers to figure things out

  


Zealous points towards a piece of random scrap with his finger and from it comes out electricity that grabs the scrap and the lightning splits up and put something together,a little hamster made of metal as zealous stops and presents it: tadaaa! See? :3  
  
  
It fucking crashes onto the ground and breaks…..zealous kicks it away as he continues walking ith simp: yeaaah…so hum you can take any weapon you want here for your journey

  


Simp head shakes in excitement

  


**A few minutes later**

  


We see simp,with a jetpack,plasma pistols on his belt,two electric plungers on his hands and laser cannons on his shoulders along with a chainsaw on his head: see? Im amazing!!! Hahahah!!!

  


Zealous: wow…youre…sooooo original…



  
Simp: hey! The hell is that suppose to mean?

  


His chainsaw on his head is so heavy he falls to the ground super harshly when he turns off his jetpack: ooow….fuck

  


Zealous: nothing nothing look,whats important is that you can defend yourself…hopefully you learn how to operate all these things in the first place as you go through your journey

  


Simp gets up as the chainsaw automatically goes behind his jetpack: yeah whatever…

  


The x knight was seen there….his arms folded up

https://preview.redd.it/0bdh52zr5i4g1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=63d8d9163aca34195a68ab19fee182e55daf7102

Zealous: when did you get here?

  


X knight: there's a job to do,the entire universe relies on this so i cant mess it up,lets get to the point then right?

  
Zealous gives a thumbs up: yep >:) sooo simp you ready?



  
Simp cam: yeah! Im gonna kick butt!  
  
  
Zealous: good luck then! X knight do the honours  
  
  
Simp cam: oh wait thats a cool name-  
  
X knight uses his axe to make a cut in space time before pushing simp in: haaaaa-  
  
  
He goes in himself later as then the cut disappears

  


Zealous takes a deep breath: okay that could of went better…

  


Thane stops being invisible: you could have assigned the programming of the robot to me…

  


Ydevge appears: you mean me right?

  


Thane: y-yeah im not the brightest  
  
  
Ydevge: wait don't we have a damn shapeshifter? Where's that person at? We haven't even seen them once,they could of been really helpful back there you know?

  


Zealous: he he well thats the thing i dont even know where they are

  
  


Ydevge: not even you? Thats weird

  


Zealous: thing is we couldnt have flc stop time for too long,someone would of eventually come there and have noticed..i had to improvise

  


Agent v coming out of nowhere his fist on the table: lets HOPE that idiot doesnt doom us all



  
Akward silence before zealous speaks: where do you all keep coming from?

  


**Back to simp and the knight**

  


They are ontop of a gigantic white mountain,the white never ending space can be seen onwards…a gray sky,a white sun and glitched and white trees everywhere….the clouds move at fast speeds and some go very slowly and simp gets all excited: he he this is gonna be awesome-

  


X knight: shh….do you hear that?

  


Simp cameraman: i technically dont have ears but i probably should….but no i dont-

  


The ground shakes as the knight speaks: crap…get ready

  


Suddenly as the shaking gets worse something comes out of the ground

https://preview.redd.it/dqmgmajh6i4g1.png?width=1220&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc8d39c02def8e2732d57dd377a3ee9f04e912ad

Referral Code: AYLGY54DAG

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

“MILLIE! MILLIE! MILLIE!”

Millie Bobby Brown blinked, stunned, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with her older brother, Charlie. They were supposed to be tucked into a quiet corner of the after-party — just two siblings hiding from the chaos — but the universe had different plans.

Charlie leaned down with that half-annoyed, half-proud smirk only older brothers can produce.

“Looks like they found you.”

She shot him a look.
“I didn’t do anything.”

“Yeah,” he snorted. “You only dropped an entire season that made half the planet scream at their TVs.”

Before she could respond, the DJ suddenly cut the music.
The rooftop lights dimmed.
Spotlights swung across the dancing crowd…
And landed right on them.

A thousand phones went up at once, glittering like constellations.

And for a second — just a second — Millie froze.

It didn’t feel real.

Not the chants.
Not the lights.
Not the fact that just a few years ago she was a kid auditioning in tiny rooms with coffee-stained carpets.

Now?
The world was cheering for her.

Then she felt it — Charlie squeezing her shoulder.

“Hey,” he whispered, leaning close enough only she could hear.
“Take it in. You earned this.”

The crowd’s roar rose again, shaking the glass railing, rolling through the night like a tidal wave.

“MILLIE! MILLIE! MILLIE!”

Somewhere in the front, a group held up massive red neon letters spelling:
EL ROCKS.

She laughed — the kind of laugh that comes from deep in the chest when your brain hasn’t caught up to your emotions yet.

Charlie lifted her hand into the air like a champion fighter who just won a world title, and the crowd went wild.

People on the dance floor jumped.
Confetti cannons exploded off the balcony.
Even the DJ yelled into his mic:

“Tonight we celebrate the one and only MILLIE BOBBY BROWN!”

Millie pointed at her brother with mock outrage.

“See what you did?”

“Nope,” he said, grinning. “This is all you.”

And for the first time all night, she didn’t hide from the spotlight.

She stepped forward, shoulders back, eyes shimmering with equal parts disbelief and happiness — the kind of look you get when life suddenly shows you a version of yourself you’ve been working toward for years.

Phones kept flashing.
People kept shouting.
Somewhere, someone began crying because Stranger Things meant that much to them.

And Millie realized something important:

This wasn’t just success.

This was a moment in time.
A memory that would anchor itself to millions of people.
A story fans would tell the same way people talk about world premieres, concerts, and historic pop moments.

Charlie nudged her again.
“You gonna say something?”

She took a breath…
Lifted her hand…
And shouted over the crowd:

“THANK YOU FOR BELIEVING IN US!”

Her voice carried into the night sky — a sky glowing with drones spelling:

𝑓𝑜𝓇 𝓉𝒽𝑒 𝒻𝒶𝓃𝓈.

The rooftop ERUPTED.

And that’s the night thousands of strangers, a sky full of drones, and one proudly smirking brother witnessed Millie Bobby Brown stand taller than she ever had before.

A night the internet would replay repeatedly.
A night that would turn into memes, edits, and fan-art.
A night fans would remember as:

1pb0wa8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pb0wa8,A closer look at The Hobbit Chronicles series,"I haven’t seen much on this range here (not too surprising, given this subreddit’s focus on literary Middle Earth / the generally divisive nature of the Hobbit films). Just wanted to share my initial thoughts in case any other collectors out there are considering it.

This is a six volume series Weta released over the three years of the Hobbit trilogy: not a broad “making of”, but a specific and exhaustive look at their production design work from every angle. Each movie gets two volumes: one for Art & Design, the second on a more specific area (eg. costumes and weaponry). It is very much Weta’s baby; less a celebration of Tolkien than of the many craftspeople dedicated to executing this specific interpretation.

As physical objects, these books are gorgeous. It’s immediately clear the project is a labour of love from people who care about their work. Tactile textures on the covers, and usually with a fold out item at the back. (Volume one has Bilbo’s contract, with some amusing notes on the process of designing it. Volume six has a large fold-out map of The Battle of Five Armies.)

It’s also worth noting that they’re quite hefty; essentially coffee table size. As shown in the photos: about the twice the width of a HarperCollins hardcover. This means they will very likely stick out beyond your shelf. Multiply it by six and it becomes quite an eye-catching statement.

I expect this would raise an interesting dilemma for those less keen on the movies. How much space do you want to give this version of The Hobbit? 

Personally, as a filmmaker (and generally someone who loves to see how the sausage is made), I found it very easy to divorce the process the final production. Whatever choices were made at the top, and however difficult the circumstances, Weta gave it their all, and that’s a feat worthy of some indulgent self-congratulation. I feel it’s important people know how much work goes into every prop and floorboard and hair follicle of a production of this scale, and broadly, how much invisible effort lies behind any given movie.

I hope this helps someone out there. Personally, despite initial misgivings about the sheer space they take (and the expense of that harder-to-find sixth volume), I’m very happy to have them in my collection. ",2,1764556254.0,tolkienbooks,0,1.0,False

The world is soft and gray. A cool morning chill is in the air. Your thoughts are still fuzzy, floating. The day hasn't really begun yet.

The gentle sound of coffee brewing. You open the cupboard and your hand finds it—the one. The mug that feels just right. You feel its comforting weight. The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song.

You wrap your hands around the mug, and a gentle warmth spreads through your fingers, chasing away the chill. You lift it, and the rich aroma of coffee envelops you. You take the first sip. And in that moment, the world sharpens. The day begins. It's a small, perfect sanctuary, just for you.

1pb0uva,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1pb0uva/kyoto_hiroshima_shimanami_kaido_fall_trip_report/,"Kyoto, Hiroshima, Shimanami Kaido fall trip report 🍁 (Part 1)","This is part 1 of our fall “cycling” trip to Japan. We have been to Japan a few times before (this is our second time in Kyoto) but first time in Hiroshima, and also our first time cycling in Japan. The first half of our trip was in Kyoto and Hiroshima, with two full days in each city. It was a bit rushed but we wanted to save more time for the cycling portion of the trip - which turned out to be the highlight so no regrets there! 

**Day 1: Kyoto Kamo River bike tour**
- Started our day at **M Stand Coffee** (Sanjo Kamogawa Terrace Cafe). View over the river was nice, the coffee flight and cakes were tasty.   
- Had a quick lunch in the basement food court of Kyoto **Takashimaya Shopping Center**
- Afternoon bike tour along Kamo River and north east Kyoto shrines and temples with **The Good Day Velo**. It was amazing to see Kyoto from a local’s perspective. Kyoto is so quiet and empty once you leave the tourist zones. Was definitely a highlight of the trip. I don’t want to spoil the list of local hidden gems, if you’re interested I suggest just booking a tour with them or checking their website.  
- After biking we explored the boutique shops near the bike store. Stumbled across **ShinPuhKan** mall, and chocolate shop Bell Amer. This area has lots of nice shops to browse for high end local products and crafts and does not feel touristy. Tons of lovely cafes to take a break. 
- Dinner at **Sake Hall Masuya**. We got the recommendation from our bike tour guide, all the food was fantastic. 
- Explored **Teramachi Shopping street**, which was very touristy but we shopped at Nomura Tailor house (for crafting and fiber art supplies) and Mont Bell 
- Stayed at **Hyatt Regency Kyoto**. In a quiet part of town but not too far from Kyoto Station, the river, and Kiyomizu-dera. Amazing bathrooms. 

**Day 2: Arashiyama and Kiyomizudera** 
- We took the 6am train to Arashiyama  and were in the **bamboo forest** around 7am. It was still a bit dark but really serene and mystical.
- Kept going uphill and ended up hiking up all the way to **Mt. Ogura Observatory**. Spectacular viewpoint over the city. Then hiked back down to **Arashiyama Park** and the river and bridge areas. 
- Took a break at **Nono tea house**. It’s hidden in a quiet neighborhood right next to the bamboo forest. Super lovely host and a relaxing place to rest. Basically had the place to ourselves. 
- Went to **Snow Peak Cafe Landstation**. This was our original reason for coming to Arashiyama and it did not disappoint. It’s so pretty. We sat in the cafe for some drinks and a hamburger for lunch.  
- Returned to central Kyoto for more shopping around **Kyoto Bal** mall. 
- Sake tasting class at **My Sake World**, where we created our own custom blends.
- **Kiyomizu-dera night illumination**, around 6-7pm. We went up chawanzaka street to try and avoid crowds but even that was packed. The crowd inside the ticketed area was actually even worse. But the temple at night is indeed beautifully lit.
- Dinner at **Yosuke Yamaji,** French fine dining in Gion district. Food is pretty good, the vibe and service were excellent, especially sitting at the chefs counter to watch them create each dish. 

**Day 3: Hiroshima (Outlets, Mazda Museum, Costco)**
- We made a trip to The Outlets for the **Snow Peak outlet store**. If you like Snow Peak gear and have luggage space, I think it’s worth the detour. The food court in the outlet mall has very cheap food with massive portions. 
- Had lunch at **Sushi Tatsu Ekie**, conveyer belt sushi right in Hiroshima station. It was delicious and cheap.
- **Mazda Museum** tour. It was free and really well run. I’m not into cars and still enjoyed the visit. 
- **Costco** trip. We bought a few things to bring back. Everything here looks so good, wish we could bring more back. 
- Dinner at **Atago.** It was quite old school teppanyaki, steak was just ok. Maybe the seafood course would have been much better 
- Stayed at **Hotel Granvia South Gate** at Hiroshima Station. Amazing location and very beautiful new hotel. I loved the lemon bath salt. 

**Day 4: Miyajima Island & Hiroshima Shopping**
- Took a 6am train then ferry to **Miyajima island**, around sunrise. Views on the ferry are spectacular at this time. 
- Walked up to the **Otorii gate** during low tide. I really think it’s better during low tide, rather than high tide, less crowded and you get a sense of how massive the gate is. 
- **Daishoin** temple. Surprisingly uncrowded, maybe because it’s up a hill. Beautiful fall colors. 
- Took the ropeway up to the top and hiked to **Mount Misen** summit. The line already started queuing around 15-30 mins before it opens. 
- After coming down we had lunch at **Momiji-so.** The food is simple but the location in the forest is really special. 
- Took the train back to Hiroshima and walked around **Peace Memorial Park**. We didn’t go in the musuem, but just strolling around the park was nice. 
- **Hondori Shopping Street** area. We really liked Andersen Hiroshima. Also visited Montbell store (one of the biggest Montbell stores I’ve been to in Japan), Yamatoya Naka-machi  (for wines, whiskey and sake) and kitchen supply store 中町食器市場
- Dinner at **Sushi Matsumoto Hiroshima**. We were seated in a private room, which is a change from the usual sushi counter. But honestly it was great to relax and have some privacy and talk. 

For Miyajima Island, I wrote a more detailed trip report here: https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/s/zRCB0hIawk

One such pair of coworkers emerge from E. Gadd's lab. First one out was a slim brunette in a green coat with an orange bandana around her neck, looking like someone who runs purely on coffee, overthinking, and spite. Her friend, a burly yet bubbly woman with long brown hair and two missing teeth, hollers back at the renowned scientist as she takes her leave.

Fran: Bye, Grandpa! Remember to take your meds!

E.Gadd: You too, Francesca! And go a little easier on those vitamin gummies!

Fran: HAH! I make no promises! 

She locks the door behind her and adjusts her cap. 

Fran: How you holding up, Andi?

The friend let's out an exhausted sigh.

Andi: I'm still wearing pants and I haven't joined a cult today, so I think we're trending upwards. You?

Fran: Pretty good! Fuse box is fixed, sewer access is sealed and secured, and the Prototypes have been put away. No more macguffins getting out on Ol' Frankie's watch, that's for sure!

She skips over to the car, faceplants into the asphalt for a moment, gets right back up, and opens the door for Andi, who just slumps onto the passenger seat. Fran shook the entire frame as she got behind the wheel. The old Corolla sputters to life with the turn of a key and chugs it's way down the road. 

Fran: So! How's it feel to be the right hand gal to the smartest man in the Mushroom Kingdom? 

Andi: Pretty good, all things considered. He's nice, he's smart, he actually pays a living wage, and.......... he really doesn't slow down much, does he?

Fran: Haha, nope! He's always itching for something to do, idle hands and all that. 

That would explain why he was working on several projects at once. Andi had followed him across the entire district by the time her shift was done. Even as they were exiting the parking lot, she could still hear him tinkering away at his next big breakthrough. She *wishes* she still had that kind of energy. 

Fran: So, now that you have the weekends off, I was thinking we could go out on a little adventure tomorrow. We could go sightseeing, grab lunch, maybe get a few drinks, just a little something to take the edge off. 

Andi: I'm gonna be honest. I don't think I'll be able to get out of bed tomorrow. I already feel like I've been hit by-

Fran: OH S***!

Without warning, she slams the breaks. A concerning thud could be heard before the car slowed to a complete stop. Andi took a moment to collect herself as Fran frantically stumbles out of the car. 

Fran: S*** s*** s*** s*** s*** s*** s*** s*** s***!

Andi: What the hell!? What's-?

A single glance out the windshield made her heart drop down to her stomach. She too then exits the car and rushes to Fran's side, both now crouching down beside the concerningly still figure laying atop the asphalt, shrouded in black cloth.

Fran: Uh....... hello? Can you hear me?

There was no reply.

Andi: Oh no. Oh God no. Tell me he isn't dead. Please tell me he isn't dead! PLEASE TELL ME HE ISN'T DEAD!

Andi began to spiral. Her heart grew heavy at the thought of having killed somebody. Fran grabs her by the shoulders and looks her in the eye.

Fran: Andi, listen to me. *I* was the one behind the wheel. If push comes to shove, this is on *me.* It's not your fault.

Andi had trouble believing that for a moment. She couldn't help but think this wouldn't have happened had she been paying attention. She could've been more alert, either warning Fran or at least asking her to slow down instead of just letting herself dose off. It wouldn't be the first time somebody died on her watch.

Fran: Just breathe, Andi. Breathe. 

She takes a deep and shaky breath. Her heart begins to slow down, and her head begins to clear up. Fran was right. It was an accident. Even if Fran ended up facing charges, there was no doubt that E. Gadd would vouch for her granddaughter if need be. But even still, they now had a dead body on their hands........... or did they? The two began to hear something crunch. The body began to move. 

Andi: Oh my god, HE'S ALIVE! 

Her immediate instinct was to rush to the figure's side, but Fran stops her. 

Fran: Woah, easy! Let me handle this. 

Fran approaches the shambling figure as it rose back to its feat. 

Fran: Um, hey buddy! Are you okay? 

The figure just stood there with its back turned to them, seemingly unfazed by the whole ordeal.

Fran: I think you may have a *severe* concussion. Maybe a little hopped up on adrenaline, too. 

Still no response. Fran approaches further and reaches out.

Fran: Just hang on tight and we'll get you to a-

A sickening crunch can be heard as the figure's head makes a sudden 180 degree *SNAP.* It's face was completely barren. It had no eyes, no ears, no nose or mouth, just a single gear shaped signet on its forehead that glowed with a menacing red light. Andi let out a blood curdling shriek as Fran immediately jumps back to her side, both their hearts now beating in their ears. 

Fran: OH HOLY CHRIST! 

The figure slowly turned the rest of its body towards them, revealing a small window in its chest. A black pulsing heart pumped pulsing red oil through its veins. Muscles strained and cartilage crunched with every twitch, and prosthetics hissed with the flow of vapors through flexile ceramic tubes. It's sharpened metal digits left a gash in the car's hood as it lurched forward. Fran immediately plants herself in front of Andi. 

Fran: Hey now! I....... I understand you're upset! Let's just calm down and we can talk about this-

An ear piercing shriek cuts her apology short. A swipe to the face grazes her cheek as she dodges back. It looks like negotiation was no longer an option.  

Fran: GAH! MOTHERF***ER! I was trying.........

Her arm cocks back with a tightened fist as the Ghoul went for another swipe

Fran: ......... TO APOLOGIZE! 

It was like a gunshot. Her fist slammed right into its absent face. The force of that punch sends the Ghoul flying across the street, landing somewhere in the adjacent alley. She made sure to check on Andi, who thankfully wasn't hurt. She was however exceptionally stressed and on the verge of passing out from mental fatigue as Fran quickly guides her back to the car.

Andi: Hey Fran?

Fran: Yep?

Andi: I think I might take you up on that bar trip tomorrow. 

The Ghoul laid twitching in a heap, soaking in a puddle of its own vital fluids. What few natural bones it had were either cracked or splintered from the landing alone, and it's lower jaw was completely gone, revealing a malformed set of upper teeth and a shriveled tongue. The Ghoul turns its head towards the shadows and saw a pair of bright red lights staring back.

Rhode: *Sigh.* Pity. Another one for the reject pile. 

He heard the screeching of rubber on asphalt as the Corolla floored it out of there. The Xelor stood over the mangled heap that once showed him promise. Most of the Ghoul's internal augmetics were severely damaged after that hit from the car, but Fran's haymaker and the equally rough landing had left it completely unsalvageable, save for the signet still attached to its face. He kneels before the pitiful creature as it twisted and jittered.

Rhode: Still, the fact you were able to function with such little Kuva was impressive. A welcome consoltation, I suppose. 

The Ghoul felt Rhode's fingers touch its forehead. It's heart began beating quicker and quicker as it began to feel something tug at its skin. A long raspy hiss sputtered out of its exposed throat as it felt something tear a patch of skin from its skull. Rhode rises back to his feet with the signet in hand. The bulb began to glow white, as did Rhode's eyes. Through the signet, he saw a pair of headlights skidding towards him.  Vital readings and structural analysis took a noticeable dip as the impact sent his point of view tumbling onto the asphalt.

*Fran: Uh....... hello? Can you hear me?*

He fast forwards through Andi's little episode until the Ghoul got up and turned towards them. He scanned every inch of that encounter, and soon took notice of what *really* rendered the poor thing unsalvageable.

*Fran: I was trying.......... to APOLOGIZE!*

A part of him felt all remaining readings plummet the moment Fran's fist made contact. The hit from that Corolla was a mere love tap compared to that punch. 

Rhode: *Hm......* I see. 

The bright light fades and he looks back down to the twitching Ghoul at his feet, still trying in vain to move its mangled vessel. 

Rhode: Don't fret, my dear.

He stows the signet and ignites a spark in his palm, which rapidly grows into a concentrated fireball.

Rhode: This will be quick.

This past week has been awful. I got off early today because I had a “friend” that was going to bring me & the babies some food. Welp, I have been waiting now for 2 hours & not a call or text back. The food banks are closed today ( just my luck) . So now I am scrambling to find a solution. We are almost out of wipes.  My babies are literally throwing the worst tantrums. My 3 year old decided to pour bubbles out because I won’t let him flush a hairbrush 🙃. I haven’t ate but a bagel since lastnight so my body is slowing breaking down. I wish I had coffee. I wish I had peace for just a moment. I want to scream . I hope you all are rocking it better than I am at the moment because I am about to pull my hair out.

1pb0qig,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pb0qig,Light Yagami vs Kira,"**Kira vs Light**

Death Note vs JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure

  
Track Name: Kage No Satsujin-sha

  
Kosaku Kawajiri was walking down the street, his suit in pristine condition as if he had just bought it. He was a simple office worker with a wife and a child. He had a stable income and he was rather meek, avoid confrontation when he could. Except this man was not Kosaku Kawajiri, instead being a man who had killed him and stole his life. This man’s true identity was Kira Yoshikage, a serial killer who would steal the hands of women. He was currently on his way to work, passing a nearby radio.

  
News Reporter: “And now a follow up to the Kira case“

  
Kira froze, break into a cold sweat as he slowly turned to the radio. He was listening to the radio intently, gripping his brief case. Apparently another serial had made himself known and, whether by coincidence or not, was using his old name. He tried to calm himself, thinking it was just that: a coincidence. Someone then tapped his shoulder, snapping him out of his stupor and turning to see a police officer.

  
Soichiro: “Sir? I’m a new officer in town, and I’d like to ask you some questions if that’s alright. I’m investigating the Kira case and I heard of some disappearances here. Care to share anything you know?”

  
Soichiro Yagami was here on official business while his son, Light was off to the side and eating an apple. Kira would have originally paid them no mind and went about his day, but something about this officers son felt…off.

  
Kira: “Unfortunately I have to be getting to work. Apologies.”

  
Kira tried to play it cool, seem as natural as he could. Meanwhile, Light was having a small internal monologue. He was trying to plan ahead, seeing how much he could take advantage of this.



Light: \*“This is good…If father focuses on some new killer and thinks it’s Kira, then that takes some heat off of me. Hopefully I won’t have to resort to the Death Note, but if worst comes to worst…”\*



Kira bowed before walking past them, making sure not to appear uncomfortable. After all, any change in attitude might set them off and he didn’t want to test fate. After Kira left, Ryuk appeared beside Light.



Ryuk: “Hey, Light. That guy seemed kinda weird, don’t you think? Should we maybe keep an eye on him?”



Light hadn’t thought twice about the man, but he did look a little bizarre. Later that night, Kira was going back home after work when he saw Light further ahead. He assumed it was just a kid doing kid stuff, intending on just passing by. But Light stopped him, a small and warm smile on his face.



Light: “Hello, can I ask you some questions? You met me and my father earlier this morning, so I’d love to ask questions about anything you might know…”



Kira was on guard now. He knew denying this request a second time would prove suspicious and put a greater target on him if he just answered the questions. He pretended to check his watch, looking back at Light.



Kira: “Sure. I have time. But let’s at least make it quick, my wife gets antsy if I’m gone for too long…”



Light smiled, guiding Kira inside a nearby Morioh cafe. They sat next across from one another, light analyzing Kira as best as he could. He just seemed so…unassuming. The only distinct part about him was his hair with how it was slightly spiked upwards. And even then, it wasn’t the craziest hair style out there.



Light: “Let’s start simple, shall we? First, can you tell me your name and occupation?”



Kira: “My name is Kosaku Kawajiri, and I am a simple office worker.”



Light waited for further elaboration but didn’t get any. He had a feeling this man was going to be rather direct and to the point which he was fine with. Even if that made some probing a bit difficult. Besides, he had his name now in case things got dicey in one way or another…



Light: “Very well…My name is Light Yasahi. Do you perhaps know anything about the disappearances here? We have reason to believe that this may be tied to a new serial killer by the name of Kira.”



It was Kira’s turn to have his own inner monologue. He was trying to plan ahead and use this new Kira’s exploits to his benefit. Kira’s nails subtly grew a bit longer from the growing stress despite his best attempts to remain calm.



Kira: \*“Remain calm…If this brat is searching for a completely unrelated Kira, then I can use my prior murders to springboard from that and pin them all on this new killer. Thus completely freeing myself from both this wannabe detective and my past as Kira Yoshikage. But I have to make sure he doesn’t meet Josuke and the others…If they work together, then my quiet life will be thrown in jeopardy again.”\*



Kira cleared his throat of growing phlegm, looking at Light like he was any other person.



Kira: “Of course, I would be glad to help you. After all, the idea that a killer could be hiding in this small town sends a shiver down my spine.”



Light analyzed the man across from him, getting an off feeling. When they met earlier that day, he seemed rather dismissive about him and his father. But now, he seemed a bit eager to help them. Light began to think to himself, his mind going a mile a bit.



Light: “He seems rather eager to help us now. Why? Is it simply a concerned citizen wanting to keep his town safe? Perhaps, but then why be so dismissive when we met? Was work really such a priority?”



A waitress came by and gave them their coffees. Kira put on his best normal face as he could, trying his damndest to suppress his urges. But her hands looked very well taken care of. She must have a routine…Light meanwhile took a sip of his coffee before speaking up.



Light: “Thank you ma’am. Now, mister Kawajiri, tell me everything you know about the disappearances.”



Kira fully composed himself, telling Light small things about the disappearances in Morioh. Since he didn’t know any of the names of those he killed, he had to be as vague as possible without being so vague that he was thought useless and he wouldn’t be able to influence Light’s decisions. An hour or so later, Light and Kira sat up and shook hands.



Light: “Thank you for your time, mister Kawajiri. If you learn anything else, feel free to contact me. We will be sure to catch this killer.”



Kira nodded, taking Lights phone number and bowing before walking off. When Kira was far enough away, Light turned away from the cafe before Ryuk appeared and they began to chat.



Ryuk: “So, what do you think? He was kinda weird, right?”



Light: “He had a strange air about him…I can’t put my finger on it, and that irritates me. Regardless, he gave some decent enough information like where some of the people were last seen. Still, I’ll need to be on guard. He was rather quick to help us despite his dismissal last time, so I would rather not take any chances if I don’t have to. Besides, I have his name now. So if things get tricky, I have an easy out.”



Light adjusted his tie, Ryuk’s permanent grin growing wider. The next day, Kira woke up and did his morning routine. He put on a button up shirt with nice pants and house shoes as today was a day off for him. He was currently finishing up cooking breakfast for this family he had gotten himself into and was currently looking at Light’s phone number. He would normally never risk calling anyone associated with the police, but he also couldn’t risk this new killer making it any harder for him so he had to put an end to this farce as fast as possible. Light meanwhile was staying at a hotel in Morioh with his father. He was currently in the lobby while eating breakfast and reading a book. He felt his phone ring and looked down to see an unknown number. Cautiously, he answered it.



Light: “Hello?”



Kira: “It’s Kawajiri. I was wondering if you would like for me to serve as a sort of guide around Morioh so you can look for any clues.”



Light’s guard was now on high alert. It was rather strange that he couldn’t just tell him the location, instead wanting to be in person. Maybe he was just being considerate, but it was better safe than sorry.



Light: “Of course. I will be over later this afternoon. I hope we can find anything useful to put this killer down for good.”



With that, they exchanged goodbyes with Kira telling Light that he would meet him at the hotel he was staying at. Light then looked at Ryuk who was hovering beside him. Light had a thoughtful expression on his face, turning to Ryuk and subtly speaking to him so as not to draw any attention.



Light: “Ryuk, I need you to do something. When Kawajiri arrives, keep an eye out for anything or anyone that seems out of place. Better safe than sorry as they say.”



Ryuk did a mock salute before disappearing, Light getting up and walking up to his room. A few hours or so later, Light made his way down to the lobby where he saw Kira making his way inside. Light began to think to himself, wanting to plan out how this would go.



Light: “He said he would show me around where the people disappeared. I’ll use this to properly get a read on his personality, with Ryuk keeping watch to make sure no one’s tailing us. More specifically, me.”



Kira meanwhile was trying to appear normal as he subtly scanned the area. Not for Light, but for Jotaro. After all, if he remembered right, he was supposed to be staying here as well. When he saw Light nearby, he had already turned to leave.



Kira: “There you are. Come now, let’s not waste anymore time…\*After all, I don’t want to risk that hat-haired trash finding me even if I have changed my face and identity…\*”



Light: “Of course, that makes sense…”



Light was taken aback by how forward he was being in getting started, raising some alarms for him. He set off after him, glancing up at Ryuk who was flying above them as a lookout as he requested. They walked through Morioh, with Kira being silent as they made their way to the most recent site he remembered killing someone. Light decided to poke around a bit, looking up at Kira.



Light: “Tell me mister Kawajiri, do you perhaps have any hobbies? Maybe you can tell me a bit about your family.”



Kira: “No, I am too busy to have any hobbies. And I love my family, it’s as simple as that.”



Light’s eye slightly twitched in annoyance. There was no way someone could as white toast as this, having no hobbies or seemingly any discernible thoughts about their family. He figured any further questions would hit a similar road block. Light thought to himself, his internal frustration for not being able to read this man getting to him.



Light: “There has to be something that sets him apart from others. Let’s see…I saw him tense ever so slightly when he saw that waitress last night. Perhaps he’s just unfaithful?”



Kira meanwhile was getting upset with Light trying to pry into his life. He always hated small talk like that and just hated small talk in general. He looked ahead, seeing the apartment building he broke into and killed the couple of. Kira began to think to himself, confident that he covered his tracks well.



Kira: “\*I erased all evidence of me being there. The most known about this crime scene is that the owners disappeared without a trace.\*”



When they arrived at the apartment, Light immediately began looking for any evidence. This other serial killer surely left something behind, whether finger prints, DNA, or even something else. However, Light was evidently having issues as he was finding nothing. He bit his nail, his mind wracking in thought.



Light: “\*What kind of serial killer leaves nothing behind? The couple was last seen entering this apartment from what news said and they just disappeared with their belongings being left behind. It’s almost supernatural…\*”



Kira meanwhile was wondering what kind of killer this new Kira was. Letting his curiosity get the better of him, he looked over at Light before speaking up.



Kira: “This Kira figure…do you have any leads to go off of? Does he have a specific pattern maybe?”



Light: “Hm? Oh, we do have a few things. Most of his victims seem to die via a heart attack but occasionally something else will happen. Heart attack however is the most common.”



Kira was now deep in thought. That’s how this killer fought, through heart attacks?



Kira: “\*Could it be this other Kira is a stand user as well? If that is the case, then getting rid of him may prove to be more difficult than I thought…\*”



Just then, Light finally found something. He reached into his suit pocket and pulled out a small pair of tweezers, reaching down and picking up a small black hair.



Light: “Well, looks like we have some kind of DNA sample. Sorry, but I must go and run this through forensics immediately. Then, we can catch this killer.”



Light wrapped the hair in a piece of cloth before he sped past Kira who was frozen solid. Had he shed a hair without noticing, leaving even a crumb of evidence for this brat?!



Kira: “\*I can’t let him find out my true identity! He said he was heading to the forensics lab…looks like desperate times call for desperate measures.\*”



Kira began following after Light, making sure to follow at a distance so as to not be seen. Meanwhile, Ryuk had just come down to Light’s level.



Ryuk: “No one was following you today. At least it didn’t look like it.”



Light: “Damn. Well, we have this DNA sample either way. I should be able to find this killer and frame them as Kira to get some heat off of me for a bit.”



Ryuk glanced back at Kira, having seen him begin to follow Light after he left. Normally he would have told Light about this, but he wanted to see what would happen. He was here for entertainment above all else after all. Later at the forensic lab, Light was getting ready to test the hair and run it across all the criminals in the Morioh database to at least narrow out the numbers.



Light: “\*Morioh is a small place, so if I at least know who it isn’t then I can find out who it is eventually.\*”



As he was about to get to it though, he thought he heard a weird sound. He stopped his movements for a moment, listening closely. It sounded like…tank tracks? He turned around, being able to faintly make out a small shape on the floor that was no bigger than an RC car.



Sheer Heart Attack: “Look over here…”



That was all Light heard before the object hurtled towards him. Light barely managed to dodge, seeing the small object collide with the beakers and bunsen burners behind him along with some chemicals. Light backed away, filled with panic as he had no idea what was happening.



Ryuk: “Oh, looks like because you touched the Death Note that you can see general things regarding the soul. Not fully though, just a silhouette.”



From Ryuk’s POV, he could see Sheer Heart Attack clear as day. With the blue shell like tank slowly coming out of the things it knocked over. Light clicked his tongue in annoyance, wondering how such a thing is even happening.



Light: “\*Could it be the killer also has a Shinigami?! That could explain how all the victims just disappear without a trace…Think Light, this thing has to have rules like the Death Note! Maybe…”



Light got an idea, looking up at Ryuk as Sheer Heart Attack slowly tread forward towards him.



Light: “Ryuk, search the area! Whoever sent this thing might be nearby!”



Ryuk did a mock salute before flying up through the roof, Light barely managing to dodge another bum rush. Ryuk meanwhile was flying out of the police station where he saw Kira walking away with a small smile on his face. Ryuk flew back down, going back into the forensics room to see Light trying to put as much distance between him and Sheer Heart Attack.



Ryuk: “Hey, buddy. Looks like it was your buddy Kawajiri that sent this thing”



Light’s eye twitched harder, grinding his teeth as he grabbed some random flammable liquid from a shelf as he put the pieces together.



Light: “\*Of course, it all makes sense now…he was trying to do the same thing I was doing! I need to lose this thing before it does something and probably kills me. He ducks from another attack by Sheer Heart Attack. He chucked the flammable liquid at the small tank, a bunsen burner sparking and catching fire along with the flammable liquid. Sheer Heart Attack then suddenly exploded, sending Light back. His ears were ringing, watching as Sheer Heart attack started spinning in narrow circles as it tried to chase the fire on its body.



Light: “What the…? Is it broken now? Why’d it just start spinning? Wait a minute…”



Light started thinking it over, wondering what it had been doing the second it got here. He assumed it was some kind of sentient thing or acting on orders, but it seemed to be something more.



Light: “\*The first thing it did was target me, so I assumed it was targeting me specifically. And while that may have been the intent, it doesn’t seem like that’s how it inherently works. It only exploded when it reached something hot. Now, it’s spinning in its own flames…Heat! It must be attracted to heat and explode only when it reaches that! That’s why it was only attacking me…Which means I just have to stall it with heat long enough to escape!\*”



Sheer Heart Attack’s flames now died out, slowly turning to Light. Its eyes glowed a bright red that Light could barely make it with how little he could see of it.



Sheer Heart Attack: “Look over here…!”



It charged forward, with Light running away as fast as he could around the forensics lab. He grabbed a bunch of flammable liquids as he did, throwing a bunch of them on the ground and coating the floor. He looked back at Sheer Heart Attack, seeing it splashing around the liquids as it chased after him. Light then saw a left behind lighter, most likely from an officer that smokes. He picked up the lighter, flicking it and tossing it into the flammable liquids and setting the forensics lab ablaze. Sheer Heart Attack immediately did a 180, plunging itself into the flames and exploding. Light coughed, running away as fast as he could from the scene. He panted as he made it outside, reaching down into his shoe and pulling out a small page from the Death Note.



Light: “I wanted to take the heat off of me…have someone else take the fall for a bit. But it looks like I can’t afford to do such a thing. If I let Kawajiri roam free, O could day any day. Goodbye, Kosaku Kawajiri…”



He took a pen from his suit pocket and scribbled the name onto the page. He smiled deviously, putting the page back in his shoe before making his way back to the hotel. The next day, Light woke up with a fresh start. He turned on the Morioh radio, hearing about the forensics lab that caught fire with the running idea being a gas leak. He and his father decided to go out for breakfast that day, hearing about a good Italian restaurant named Tonio’s nearby. Light had a small pep in his step glad to be able to remove that threat from his life. His dad looked back at him, wondering what could be causing him to be so chipper so early when he looked back and saw a familiar face.



Soichiro: “Isn’t that the Kawajiri fellow who’s been helping you with the case? Looks like he’s heading to work.”



Light’s heart stopped, looking forward to see his father was telling the truth. In front of them was Kira with a new look, his hair slicked back and a white color with black streaks in it now. Light was trying his hardest not to panic outwardly, but this had never happened before.



Light: “\*What’s happening?! I wrote his name in the Death Note!!! Did I misspell it?! If not that, the only other logical conclusion would be-!!! …He didn’t tell me his real name…? Did he know I was Kira?! Does he know about the Death Note!?\*”



Kira walked forward, seeing light and emanating a bloodlust only a fellow killer would notice. He stopped in front of Soichiro, bowing before speaking up.



Kira: “Sorry to disturb you sir. But may I speak to your son? I have something rather important and personal to discuss…”



Soichiro was a bit confused but shrugged it off as maybe he and his son had some kind of pact or something going on. He went ahead, Kira looking back at Light with a deadly aura around him. It was early in the day, so no one was around right now which made it the perfect time to strike.



Kira: “Hello mister Asahi…How has your morning been? I heard about the gas leak at the forensics lab, so I hope you are all right.”



Kira was just as shocked as Light was, but he assumed that maybe he figured out Sheer Hear Attack like Koichi did. Light seemed smarter than Koichi, so maybe it wasn’t out of the realm of possibility. Light meanwhile was wondering how to best approach this, now panicking hard as this killer with abilities he was unfamiliar with was standing right in front of him.



Light: “\*Keep it cool…I’m sure he doesn’t know that I know who he is.\*”



Light composed himself, looking up at the man in front of him. Now that he knew he was the killer as well as having abilities similar to his own, he had to play it extra safe.



Light: “It’s ok, I’m fine. The evidence of course got destroyed though, so unfortunately that’s our one lead down. I still haven’t found out who this killer is…”



Light was making sure to check his body language to make it seem he wasn’t lying. While he wasn’t lying about the evidence, he was lying about not knowing the killer and was trying desperately to hide that fact. Kira was looking him over, his eyes becoming darker as a shape started to manifest.



Kira: “Did you know that one of the telltale signs of a liar is that they will stare at you without blinking much? They also try and be as still as possible…”



Light’s heart jumped into his throat, realizing he had been trying too hard to play it safe. Kira sighed, gripping his brief case before looking back at Light.



Kira: “My name is Kira Yoshikage…”



Light: “\*…What?\*”



Kira: “I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am technically married. I work as an employee for a department store, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone…”



Light was incredibly confused as to why he was being told all of this. That’s when he realized: Kira was confident that he could kill him here and now without fear of exposure. However, he didn’t know that he gave him the one tool he could use to win. Light didn’t bother responding, instead immediately turning tail and running away. Kira walked after Light, as if it were a scene straight out of a slasher. Light took a sharp turn down a street, hiding in an alleyway. He looked down at his watch, seeing the page from the Death Note still inside.



Light: “\*Yes! If I can just write his name down, I can walk free of this and sleep peacefully for now! This is now my perfect vic-!\*”



A click could be heard as Light’s watch suddenly exploded, taking his hand with it. Light shrieked, clutching his now stump of a hand as he writhed around on the alley floor. He looked up to see Kira with the silhouette of some demon like figure standing behind him.



Kira: “This is my Killer Queen. It can make whatever it touches into a bomb. Remember when we shook hands when we first met? I planted that bomb just in case something like this happened. I had hopes Sheet Heart Attack would have killed you, but it looks like I have to do it all myself.



Light: “You…You…!”



Kira: “You’re that new Kira, aren’t you?”



Lights heart stopped as his blood ran cold.

How did he figure that out?! There was no way he could have, he made sure of it!



Kira: “You looked behind me when you ran away. I looked back and saw nothing, so that means you saw something…You saw my Killer Queen. Meaning you’re a stand user, or at least have some kind of ability that would let you see that. And judging by how you looked a bit surprised to see me as I was you, that can only mean you thought I had been dead…possibly by your Stand ability. Logical leap? Maybe…but either way, I can sleep soundly now knowing you’re gone…”



Killer Queen slowly reached its hand out, ready to touch Light’s face. Light tried to get up but the blood loss was hampering his motor skills. He looked up at the sky and saw Ryuk smiling down at him before he flew off, Killer Queen’s hand now touching his face.



Light: “\*No…this cannot be how it ends!!! I’m an alleyway in some hick town?! NO!!! I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE GOD OF THE NEW WORLD!!! I-\*”



Then everything went black for Light as Killer Queen’s explosion became his note of death…",4,1764555792.0,DeathBattleMatchups,3,1.0,False
1pb0qgf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ConstipationAdvice/comments/1pb0qgf/bad_constipation_after_cutting_coffee/,Bad Constipation After Cutting Coffee,"So I’ve been a daily morning coffee drinker for several years, and about a month ago, I decided to cut coffee/caffeine. I would usually have a bowel movement every morning shortly after my coffee, but ever since giving my coffee up, I haven’t been able to go without the help of laxatives. I’ve kinda been on a pattern of going 2-3 days without pooping and then finally taking a laxative (I’ve used Smooth Move tea and mag citrate), getting some relief, and then repeating the cycle over. I’ve been feeling very uncomfortable and full down there, and I really miss feeling cleared out every morning.

I know that constipation is pretty common after caffeine withdrawal, but I’m nervous that I won’t be able to go normally on my own again. I really don’t want to rely on laxatives for too long because I know they can also be habit forming (and if all else fails and I do have to rely on something to go, I’d rather it be coffee anyways😂). I don’t think a diet change would fix it, as I already eat plenty fiber and drink a good amount of water. I’m active and exercise throughout the week. I’ve been drinking herbal tea and doing gut massages/exercises in the mornings to try to stimulate something, never to my success. I tried prune juice, and it only caused gas and bloating for me. I've been in a calorie deficit since I’m working on losing some weight, but I’ve been dieting longer than I’ve been off caffeine so I don’t think that’s the issue. I started taking probiotics and psyllium husk and haven't noticed any changes. Magnesium oxide and glycinate have not helped me either. I’m really not sure what else to do or if maybe waiting it out and giving my bowels more time to adjust is the only solution. I just scheduled a doctor's appointment to see if they have any recommendations. I really don't want this to be a forever thing. 

\- Zero urge to go

\- Just constipation, no diarrhea

\- No other other symptoms

\- No medications

\- No sexual abuse

Anyone else been here or have any suggestions on how to improve gut motility long term after caffeine withdrawal? TIA!",1,1764555787.0,ConstipationAdvice,1,1.0,False

Quick stats

Age/Gender: 31M

Location: Raleigh, NC

Distance: Looking for someone within ~100 miles of Raleigh so we can actually see each other, not just text forever

Looking for: Long-term relationship → Being Together (You, I and God) can't use the M word→ family

Orientation: Straight

Kids: None yet, but I do want kids

Religion: Christian – faith matters to me, but I’m not into rigid, performative church culture

Lifestyle: On disability (kidney transplant survivor), part-time student & baker, building a future business



---

Who I am

I’m the guy people describe as having a “Rottweiler personality”: serious face, focused energy, looks a little intense on the outside… but if you’re in my circle, I’m loyal, gentle, and I will absolutely go to bat for you.

I’ve been through a lot medically (kidney transplant, immune-compromised), and it changed how I view time, health, and relationships. I don’t do disposable people, and I don’t treat commitment lightly. That’s shaped me into someone who is:

Blunt but caring – I say what I mean. You won’t have to guess where you stand with me.

Extroverted with depth – I can talk for hours, but I’d rather talk about real things than just small talk.

Loyal as hell – My inner circle is small on purpose. If you’re in it, I show up.


On the outside: focused, intense, maybe a little intimidating.
On the inside: service-oriented, protective, and the type who will cook for you, help you think through your plans, and make the drive to show up when it matters.


---

What my life looks like right now

I’m in school for Baking & Pastry and Hospitality.

I work in a bakery and actually love the craft side of it—doing things properly, learning technique, not just throwing flour around.

Long-term, I’m building a dessert/hospitality brand: think bakery, dessert bar, and eventually a themed space built around storytelling, comfort, and “breaking bread” with people.

I’m also involved in support spaces for dialysis, transplant, and ESRD folks (podcast, Discord, etc.), because I’ve lived that life and I care about giving people somewhere to feel understood.


Most days: early morning kitchen shifts, classes, then creative work—recipes, business planning, writing, and world-building.


---

Personality & communication

If you want someone who will just “go with the flow” and never say what they actually think… I’m not that.

If you value clarity, honesty, and consistent effort, that’s more my lane.

I over-communicate instead of ghosting.

I don’t do texting games or intentional confusion.

I can come off intense when I care about something, but I’m actively working on being a better listener and softening how I deliver the truth.

I want a relationship that feels like steady, kind teamwork, not constant chaos.


My main love language is Quality Time: driving to see each other, hanging out in real life, grocery runs together, late-night conversation, road trips, or just existing in the same room doing our own things.


---

Values, boundaries & dealbreakers

Things that actually matter to me:

Faith / Spiritual alignment: I’m Christian. I’m not expecting you to be perfect or ultra-religious, but I do want someone who shares that or is genuinely open to it, not hostile to it.

Loyalty: This is non-negotiable. I don’t cheat, and once I commit, I’m in. I expect the same.

Family & stability: I want a peaceful home, a family, and a life that feels like we’re building something together, not just passing time.

Responsibility: You don’t have to have everything figured out, but you should care about your future, money, and basic adult responsibilities.

Emotional availability: If your go-to move is stonewalling, silent treatment, or punishment for honesty, we won’t work.


Hard boundaries / non-negotiables:

🚭 No smoking – cigarettes, vapes, anything. Hard no.

🚫 No drugs – weed or anything else. Not my world, not interested.

🍷 Drinking:

Social drinking is totally fine. Have a cocktail, grab a drink with dinner, enjoy a weekend outing.

But I don’t babysit drunk people.

I’m not dragging you out of bars, managing your blackout nights, or cleaning up after binge drinking.



In short: I don’t babysit anyone except my future kids.

Other dealbreakers: cheating, chronic lying, untreated addiction, cruelty (to people or animals), constant drama, or using silence as a weapon.


---

Health & lifestyle (so you’re not surprised)

Because of my transplant and immune system, there are some built-in realities:

I have to be more careful about germs, exhaustion, and stress than the average person.

I think a lot about long-term health and sustainable routines.

I’m currently on disability, but actively working toward a future where my income comes from my own businesses and projects.


I’m not looking for a caretaker. I handle my own stuff. But my life isn’t “party five nights a week” either. My ideal night is good food, good company, and something that actually leaves us better—not wrecked.


---

Distance & real-life connection

I’m not anti-online, but I want this to be real-world possible, not theoretical.

I’m based in Raleigh, NC.

I’m looking for someone within about 100 miles of Raleigh so grabbing coffee, dinners, walks, and weekend plans is practical.


I don’t want a relationship that only lives in texts and voice notes. I want “Hey, are you free Friday?” to actually be a thing we can act on.


---

What I’m looking for in you

Age: 26–36

Location: Within ~100 miles of Raleigh, NC

Vibe: Emotionally mature, grounded, and actually open to long-term, not just killing time.


What I tend to be drawn to:

You’re kind and loyal, not perfect, but honest about your flaws.

You’re curious – about ideas, people, stories, faith, or the world in general.

You’ve got some kind of direction you care about: career, creative work, personal growth, etc.

You value communication and don’t think it’s weird to talk about expectations, boundaries, or feelings.

You enjoy or at least appreciate baking, good food, storytelling, or theme parks (bonus if it’s all four).

You can handle someone who is direct, sometimes intense, but genuinely trying to love well and grow as a person.


You don’t need to be wildly creative, but you should be okay with a life that’s a little unconventional: entrepreneurship, creative projects, maybe a future dessert bar or themed destination in the mix.


---

A few “us” moments I can picture

You stopping by to taste-test a new dessert I’m working on and giving real feedback.

Meeting halfway for dinner after a long week, just to decompress together.

A quiet night with dessert, a show or music, and a long talk instead of a club.

Hosting a few friends for a chill dessert spread and honest conversation instead of shouting over loud music.



---

If you’ve made it this far…

If you’re 26–36, within about 100 miles of Raleigh, NC, and you want something real with someone who is honest, loyal, and building toward a stable but creative life—feel free to reach out.

If you were DMing me on Reddit, I’d love to know:

1. Roughly where you’re located


2. What a typical day looks like for you


3. One thing you’re actively working on (in yourself or your life)

Of these, I've tried:

* Bah Humbug - spiced marshmallowy coffee! maybe a little more marshmallow than coffee.
* Beira - the pomander and horehound candies are rather forward in this one, more than I'd like. I do have an older bottle of this so take my thoughts with a grain of salt. I'm unsure of how WS blends age.
* Brumal - toasted marshmallow, blonde woods, spiced pomander, thick velvet drapes, burning candles. 
* Can't Catch Me - I really love the gingerbread but the patchouli is still too much for my nose.
* Eirwen - maple chai and that's about all I get. Again, another aged bottle.
* Frayed Sweater - the nag champa was too strong for me and stomped on all the other notes.
* Frosty Fruitcake - not bad. I don't really get the white cake note but I do get everything else, though slightly heavier on the spice than fruits.
* Northern Lights - if you like Egyptian musk, this is your jam. I don't mind it but could do without the carnation personally.
* Skadi - the cider threw me off for a moment but overall a nice spiced tea with a hint of cream to me.
* Spiced Eggnog - I don't care for eggnog but for some reason this is lovely to wear. It's like spiced cream to me.",7,1764555331.0,Indiemakeupandmore,1,1.0,False

My teeth have been straight and clean since I was a kid, and I've never had a filling. But in the past month or two, I sometimes noticed a weird smell on my dental floss. I had no idea why, because from the surface, my teeth still looked perfectly clean. Two weeks ago, I mentioned this to my dentist during a checkup. She said it might be interproximal caries and suggested taking bitewing X-rays to check the tiny gaps between my teeth. It turned out to be early interproximal decay.
The good news is that it's still early, so I don't need invasive treatments like drilling. I just need to improve my brushing technique, watch my diet, and use fluoride.
Diet-wise, I'm pretty confident. I don't like sweets, mostly just drink water, and even when I drink coffee I use a straw to avoid staining or erosion.
But when it comes to brushing technique, my dentist gave me two tips that completely changed how I thought about brushing:
Apply a bit of fluoride toothpaste directly on the floss before cleaning the gaps between my teeth, which can more effectively reduce the risk of interproximal caries
Don't rinse right after brushing; let the toothpaste stay in your mouth to extend the effect of the fluoride
The second one really shocked me. Every time I brush without rinsing, it feels super uncomfortable, almost impossible to eat. But thinking about my interproximal decay getting worse and possibly needing deeper treatment, I couldn't ignore her advice.
After trying a few times, I finally found a routine I can tolerate:
After meals: normal flossing + alcohol-free Listerine rinse
Before bedtime brushing: apply fluoride toothpaste on floss and clean the gaps between my teeth (no rinsing), then take a shower to give the fluoride some time to work
Brushing: I use my soocas neos II ultra electric toothbrush, which has a simulated Bass brushing mode, and brush with fluoride toothpaste for a full three minutes, without rinsing
Final key step: lightly use the built-in water flosser on my soocas, just to remove excess foam without washing away all the fluoride, so it doesn't feel like my mouth is full of toothpaste. If you don't have a water flosser, you can wash your hands, wet them a bit, and gently clean the tooth surfaces
With this routine, I can finally tolerate not rinsing after brushing.
Everyone's situation is different, but I think my dentist's advice makes sense and can really help prevent early interproximal caries from getting worse.
Do you guys have any other tips? I really care about keeping my teeth healthy.",0,1764555021.0,hygiene,58,0.49,False

**hdfidelity presents**  

# **Mr. Brightside**

## *Episode: The Airport Security Incident*  

---

They had designed the airport to be calming.  
That was, in retrospect, their first mistake.

There was a great deal of glass. There were smooth, pale floors that reflected light and footsteps and the mild existential panic of travelers. There were potted plants bravely trying to simulate the concept of oxygen. There were tasteful signs whispering things like *Arrivals* and *Departures* and *Please don’t bring that through security.*

Mr. Brightside stood just outside the sliding doors and admired the automatic opening mechanism. He stepped forward.

The doors parted like a polite miracle.

“Good start to a day,” he murmured, already impressed.

He held up a single brown glove in his left hand.

Moments earlier, he had discovered it alone on a bus stop bench, shaped into a perfect little sorrow. It was a nice glove. Dependable. Warm. A glove with potential. It had made him sad to see it abandoned, so he had done the only ethical thing: ridden three unnecessary stops and gotten off in front of the airport.

Airports, he knew, were full of people who lost things. Televisions had taught him that.

Inside, the terminal hummed with people who had succumbed to humanity’s unspoken agreement that shoes must sometimes be removed in public, and that a passport photo must always be deeply unflattering. He liked the scents: coffee, pretzels, expensive perfume, fear.

He approached the first uniformed person he could find: a young woman near a rope barrier who appeared to be roughly the same age as the idea of exhaustion itself.

“Pardon me,” Brightside said gently, holding up the glove. “Have you misplaced… a hand?”

She blinked. She glanced at the glove. Then at him. Then behind him. Then at the glove once more.

“I— um— sir, is there someone you’re traveling with?”

“I’m traveling with hope,” he replied cheerfully. “But he never returns my calls.”

Her radio crackled.

“I may have a… situation?” she whispered into it.

Brightside leaned closer. “Oh no, is there a lost glove department? I’d be thrilled to see it. I’m something of a connoisseur.”

“Sir, if you could just step over to—”

She gestured at a taped square on the ground.

He stepped into the wrong one, three feet to the left, nearly blocking a family of international tourists who were attempting to make emotionally complex eye contact with a sign that read *NO LIQUIDS OVER 100ML*.

“Oh goodness, this choreography is much harder than it looks,” he apologized, pirouetting out of their way and into a completely different line.

A man in a navy blue shirt noticed.

“Hey! He just cut security!”

“I didn’t cut anything,” Brightside said, delighted. “I was in theater once. Well— technically the lobby. I cried and left.”

Two TSA agents approached him like men who had been ruined by PowerPoint training videos.

“Sir, we need you to step back.”

Brightside smiled. He stepped forward instead, placing the glove gently on the conveyor belt leading into the X-ray scanner.

“There we go,” he whispered to it. “Be brave.”

An alarm blared.

The belt stopped.

Three heads snapped up at once.

“WHY is there a glove on the belt?” someone shouted.

“Oh,” Brightside beamed. “He volunteered.”

The airport did not appreciate volunteers.

Within minutes, he was being followed in that very polite but also very intense way that security professionals use to say, *We are calm but we will remember your teeth.*

Brightside, thinking he was being given a private tour on account of his kindness, gave them helpful feedback as he wandered.

“You might consider widening this corridor,” he offered a passing supervisor. “There’s a spiritual bottleneck occurring near Starbucks.”

Unknowingly, he wandered through a door that read:

**AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY**

He assumed it was French.

Inside, he discovered a small, dim hallway that led to a blinking panel of switches. A laminated chart nearby explained various emergency procedures. It was thoroughly uninteresting and therefore utterly irresistible.

He pressed a button labeled:  
**AUXILIARY LIGHTING — TERMINAL C**

Thirty overhead lights shut off across an entire concourse.

People gasped. A child screamed. A pilot dropped his phone.

In the gloom, Brightside called out, “You’re welcome! Very moody atmosphere adjustment!”

His voice echoed like an oracle’s by accident.

A supervisor named Gary, who had been promoted far too many times for purely political reasons, arrived in a mild hysteria.

“WHO is touching the panel?”

Brightside beamed at him. “Oh, splendid, do you need help with anything else while I’m here?”

Gary stared in a way usually reserved for experimental math problems.

“Are you a tester?”

“No,” Brightside said. “I’m an enjoyer.”

Gasps spread. Notes were taken.

A rookie guard leaned over to another. “What if he’s from corporate?”

“He doesn’t have a badge.”

“That’s what makes me think he’s dangerous.”

Meanwhile, Brightside discovered the intercom. He tapped it.

“Hello everyone. You’re doing wonderfully.”

It played… everywhere.

Across the airport, travelers froze, mid-sip, mid-step, mid-divorce.

A wave of applause began at Gate 22B and spread like folklore.

On instinct, someone handed him a headset.

“Yes, Captain, I do agree,” Brightside said into it, even though no one had said anything to him. “A gentle landing is best for the soul.”

Outside, a plane landed smoother than it ever had in its professional life.

News tickers updated.

**UNIDENTIFIED MAN CALMS TERMINAL, IMPROVES MORALE**

The full response arrived two minutes later:

• Airport police  
• Additional TSA  
• A very confused customs officer  
• Gary (still present, now somehow sweating twice)  
• A woman holding a chihuahua in a handbag  
• A man who definitely did not work here but looked authoritative

They formed a sort of respectful circle around him.

“Sir,” Gary said carefully. “Who are you?”

Brightside’s smile widened in relief.

“Oh thank goodness,” he said. “I’ve been wondering that all morning.”

He reached into his pocket.

Every hand moved toward a weapon.

He removed a small laminated card and the sad little brown glove.

“I believe this belongs to one of you,” he said warmly. “And if not, it feels like the kind of glove that deserves a home.”

Silence fell like snow.

Then a woman in custodial uniform gasped softly.

“That’s mine,” she whispered. “I thought I lost it forever…”

Brightside bowed with modest pride and handed it to her as if he were returning a crown.

Applause… began again.

Then cheering.

Then someone put a weird little medal around his neck.

Then someone else handed him a first-class boarding pass to a place he did not intend to go.

“I don’t believe I’m flying today,” he said kindly.

“That’s even more impressive,” a man near tears replied.

Moments later, the airport returned to partial normalcy. Gates reopened. Planes were allowed to exist again. Gary was fired for thirty seconds, rehired out of gratitude, and promoted due to “visionary flexibility.”

Brightside wandered back out through the same sliding doors he’d entered through.

Outside, he looked at the sky, thoughtful.

“Well,” he said, “That was very organized confusion.”

He checked his pockets.

He now had:

* a pretzel voucher  
* a pilot’s pen  
* a tiny plastic angel pin  
* three unrelated phone numbers  
* and the satisfied feeling of having completed a remarkably unnecessary quest

He smiled.

Then he turned… and walked directly toward a bus that was labeled:

**NOT IN SERVICE**

He climbed aboard anyway.

The driver blinked.

Brightside nodded. “Take me somewhere interesting.”

Across the city, sirens went silent. Lights turned green. A dog found its owner. Someone reconsidered a bad life decision.

At the airport, a new unspoken rule passed among staff:

*If he ever comes back… shoot him.*

And so, completely unaware of the legend he had just become…

Mr. Brightside went on his merry, catastrophic way.

1pb0dgp,https://www.reddit.com/r/UmmProducts/comments/1pb0dgp/how_does_a_smart_plug_compare_to_a_power_strip/,How does a smart plug compare to a power strip?,"You might be wondering what the real difference is between a smart plug and a regular power strip. Both help you manage multiple devices, but they work pretty differently.

A regular power strip is basically just an extension cord with multiple outlets. It lets you plug in several things at once and usually has an on/off switch. That's about it. You still need to manually turn things on and off.

A **smart plug** takes things to the next level. You can control it from your phone, set schedules, and even use voice commands with Alexa or Google Assistant. Want your coffee maker to start brewing before you wake up? Done. Need to turn off devices while you're away from home? Easy.

Here's the breakdown:

**Power strips** give you more outlets and sometimes surge protection. They're cheap and simple. But you can't control them remotely or automate anything.

**Smart plugs** let you schedule when devices turn on or off, monitor energy usage, and control everything through an app. You can create routines, like having your lights turn on at sunset automatically. The main downside is they usually only control one or two outlets at a time, and they cost more upfront.

Think about how you actually use your electronics. If you just need extra outlets for things that stay on all the time, a power strip works fine. But if you want automation, remote control, or energy monitoring, smart plugs are worth it.

Many people start with one **smart plug** for a specific purpose, like controlling a fan or lamp, then add more once they see how convenient it is. You can check out different options here: https://athomewave.com/smart-plug

The cool thing is you can mix both. Use power strips for basic needs and add smart plugs where automation makes sense. For example, plug a power strip into a smart plug to control multiple devices at once through your phone.

Smart home technology keeps getting cheaper and easier to use. What used to be expensive luxury tech is now pretty affordable for most people. If you're ready to make your home a bit smarter, https://athomewave.com/smart-plug is a good place to start comparing your options.

The choice really depends on what you need. Simple extra outlets? Power strip. Remote control and automation? Smart plug. Both have their place in a modern home.",1,1764554764.0,UmmProducts,0,1.0,False

**The good stuff**

**• The bottle material (Tritan) is legit solid**  
the main bottle uses Tritan, which is the same plastic used in baby bottles, water pitchers, and food containers. it’s supposed to be super durable, bpa-free, and highly resistant to discoloration.  
i was kinda skeptical at first, but honestly… after 3 months of constant brewing + washing, the bottle is still crystal clear. no yellowing at all. looks nearly new.

**• The filter mesh actually filters well**  
the PP Nylon filter mesh *does* turn yellow over time — this seems kinda unavoidable with cold brew since coffee oils build up. but the performance stays great.  
my cold brew always comes out clean, bright, and without sludge at the bottom.

**The annoying parts**

**• The printed ml measurements rub off fast**  
this is probably my biggest complaint.  
the ml markings on the outside look nice at first, but after a couple months of washing (even gentle hand washing), mine started fading like crazy. now some numbers are half gone (photo 1).  
For a brewer where ratios matter, having the markings disappear is kinda a big deal. i already plan to redraw the measurement lines myself with a marker at this point.

**• The filter connector is fragile**  
the connector (photo 2) piece between the mesh filter and the handle/lid feels like a weaker plastic. mine actually cracked completely because i dropped the filter once on the kitchen floor.  
after that, the whole filter basically became unusable. So I have to buy that filter again.  
Honestly, i'd recommend storing the filter separately when you’re not using it. don’t leave it attached to the lid. it breaks easier than you’d expect.

**Extra note**

the printed scale on the bottle was actually slightly crooked on mine right out of the box. i noticed it as soon as i opened it. it’s not a big issue and doesn’t really affect use, but it’s still something worth mentioning.

**Overall thoughts**

the brew quality is great, the Tritan body is genuinely impressive, and the cold brew comes out super clean every time. but the fading measurement lines + fragile connector definitely hold it back a bit.",1,1764554694.0,coldbrew,0,1.0,False

I live downtown (Tribeca/Soho area) and have a toddler around 2. First-time parent. 

I realize this is probably a pipe dream.... but does anywhere that you know of offer drop-in care in the same location as self-care for parents? I would love to be able to get a manicure while say, watching my kid play in the room next door or similar. I have done a little research and the closest I can find is a setup like Lifetime Fitness where there is daycare on-site for 2 hours if you pay extra etc so you can use gym/sauna/etc. Unfortunately, I don't live near one :( 

I do a fair amount of self-care (eg brows, manis, occasional blowout, etc)... which would be my preferred thing to parallel process.... but I would even settle for a good hot coffee and the chance to do a few emails etc while keeping an eye on my child and getting out of the apartment for 2 hours. Everything I can find seems to be very focused on parent-and-me type of play (usually in like 40 minute increments ha), which we already do, and I was curious about something different. 

Does anyone know of this type of setup (or something close) in the broader NYC area? Is it just me (#selfishparent)? Partial to downtown/BK but open!

For past few months, this coworker (about 2-3 years younger than me) and I (late 20s) have been hitting off, even randomly chatting via Teams whenever we were bored. Actually, our work relationship is a bit different from usual coworkers, but won't go into details.

In the first month when we started chatting, he would initiated to go for coffee together few times during working time. But he stopped doing that after a month, but we still chatted via Teams, even talked about our own personal lives and our future plans (individually). I know he wanted entertainment at work, and I am one of few who are of similar age as him at work that could chat for fun with him. We only saw each other for work now, but we even get a bit touchy whenever we sat beside each other. We work in different areas, so these days, we rarely see other unless by coincidence at lift lobby.

But I can't even tell if he does really like me or not, as I always perceive his actions and body language as being friendly so that I don't get wrong idea. I do like him for his personality after knowing him for few months, might have interest in dating him, and I wanted to try hitting on him but am afraid of rejection. For your context, I have never been in a relationship or even once go on a date before, so I am pretty new to this and have been caging my heart up all my life. I know life's short.

Anyway, for past 2 weeks, all of sudden, he stopped chatting with me unlike how he always did almost everyday last month. I tried taking initiative in starting a conversation few times, but his replies are not like before, as if he is starting to distance himself. He mainly pings about work now, and I have to admit that I am sad and hurt, but never showed it. I don't even know what happened; all I know that it started after he was telling me not to try get a friendship out of him. It sounds he doesn't have interest in me and that I shouldn't try hitting on him. Beside that, I often heard how that we shouldn't chase a guy, and also that we shouldn't date someone from same workplace.

Sometimes, I was thinking to bring a snack to him after work but I always think of worst scenarios such as rejecting my snacks or him throwing it away, so I never dared to try.

Yes, he is single and also never been in a relationship before, like myself. Though he had few crushes before. I don't know if taking initiative will turn him off too.

My husband made a comment about my Brother’s family taking most the cake this time and I quipped “If they only knew what my secret ingredient was they might not like it as much”. I honestly thought my husband knew I used espresso powder in it but he acted like this was a huge shocker.

I’m the only one of my family completely out of the church and my husband is mostly out but still holds on to some beliefs despite never going to church. My parents and sibling’s families are all TBMs. 

Here’s where it gets sticky. My brother’s family has been super vocal about not eating coffee based desserts like tiramisu so I’ve opted not to say anything about the addition of a small amount of espresso powder in the cake over the few years I’ve made it. My husband thinks this is disrespectful and underhanded. I can see where he’s coming from but I’m not sure how big a deal this is especially since, if you ordered chocolate cake from a restaurant there’s a good chance it has coffee or espresso in it because it enhances the chocolate flavor, and they don’t care to find out if anything else they eat has coffee in it.

My mom talks about how when she was a kid, she would beg my grandparents to smoke less. Both my maternal grandparents were 2- 3+ packs a day heavy heavy smokers. 

I started smoking occasionally at 19-20 because I wanted to die young. Depressed bullshit of knowing the family history and thinking maybe if I try hard enough I'll die young too. I stopped because they changed the law that you couldn't buy nicotine until you were 21. 

For 5 years, I had a rule for myself that I was only allowed to smoke if someone was interesting enough to bum a cigarette off of as a conversation starter or if offered one by someone else. That changed this year when I ended a long term relationship and I was on some depressed bullshit again. Now I'm dating a smoker which certainly doesn't help either. 

Currently, I go through a pack of cigarettes in like 3-4 weeks. Would go through it slower, but I let people bum cigs off me. I usually only smoke when I drink, occasionally with some coffee in the morning, or after sex. I don't like vaping because it's easier to consume it too much. It freaks me out a little because you can do it anywhere. Cigarettes have this natural limit of you can only smoke them outside and not around most people. Plus I don't smoke cigarettes on work days because I don't want to smell like smoke in the office. I own a vape but I only allow myself to use it occasionally. I hate the artificial flavor compared to the actual thing.

If I'm honest with myself, I wouldn't set all these limits on myself of only when drinking or whatever if my mom hadn't told me about begging my grandparents to stop. I can never allow my parents to know I've even tried nicotine knowing the shit they went through with my grandparents. Maybe it's a good thing.

1pazyry,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZakBabyTV_Stories/comments/1pazyry/my_friend_sent_me_coordinates_before_he/,My Friend Sent Me Coordinates Before He Disappeared. They Led to a Town That Eats Skin.,"I’m writing this from the back seat of a dead car in a town that doesn’t officially exist.

My name is Luke. I’m seventeen. If anyone finds this and doesn’t just shrug it off as some creative writing assignment, please—please send someone to Cinder Hollow.

The numbers are out there. They were the last thing my friend sent me before he disappeared, and I was stupid enough to follow them.

I keep stopping because it sounds like something is dragging itself along the pavement outside. I don’t know how long I have, so I’m going to move fast.

It started with a text from Mason.

He worked nights for a delivery app. We’d text while he sat in his car between orders. Three weeks ago, at 10:47 p.m., my phone buzzed.

you ever heard of the skinned man?

I was in my room, lights off, TV on mute, scrolling.

is that a band or another cryptid you’re trying to scare me with

He didn’t answer. A minute later, my phone vibrated three times.

First: a link to some old, ugly forum.

Second: a screenshot of a thread titled Cinder Hollow / The Skinned Man (DO NOT GO THERE).

Third: a separate text.

40.8319, -78.3941

No “lol.” No explanation. Just coordinates.

what is this

No answer.

I tried calling. It rang twice, then went to voicemail. Not unusual. I figured he was driving. I fell asleep eventually.

The next morning, he wasn’t at school.

By lunch, everyone knew he hadn’t come home from his shift.

By the weekend, his mom had flyers up. The news ran a short segment. “Last seen making deliveries in the late evening.” They showed a generic shot of a car with the delivery logo. They talked about his “last known route.”

They didn’t mention the coordinates.

Nobody knew he’d sent them to me.

I clicked the link.

The forum looked ancient—black background, gray text, no avatars. The original poster of the thread had deleted their account. Their post described an abandoned town in the woods off a forgotten stretch of highway in Pennsylvania. No signs. No services. A church. A basement. A well that “went down wrong.” Flesh on the walls, “still talking.”

They called it Cinder Hollow.

They talked about something they called the Skinned Man.

Most replies were jokes and arguments. But a few accounts didn’t comment anywhere else, and they all said some version of the same thing:

where did our skin go

Buried halfway down the thread, I found Mason’s numbers.

40.8319, -78.3941

Underneath, someone had written:

it’s the church u have to go down in the church

That user never posted again.

When I clicked the coordinates, my maps app dropped a pin in the middle of a huge patch of green. Zoom in: trees, a thin gray line that might be a road. Zoom out: no town name. No labels.

That was the night the noises in my house started.

I woke up around three to the sound of footsteps above my room.

Our house is one story with an unfinished attic. No one goes up there except my dad once a year. There is no reason for anyone to be walking around overhead.

Soft, careful steps. A creak. A pause, like whoever was up there had stopped to listen.

The air in my room felt heavy. I told myself it was the house settling. Old wood. Temperature drop.

Then something scraped across the ceiling. Slowly. Like a heavy bag being dragged.

The steps passed directly over my bed.

I lay there with my eyes open, staring at the dark, counting my breaths until the house went quiet again.

In the morning, Dad looked tired over his coffee.

“You were up late,” he said. “Sounded like someone walking around. Neighbor texted me, said they thought they saw your light on at one.”

“I never got out of bed,” I said.

He shrugged. “House is old, Luke. Don’t overthink it.”

There it was—that little dismissive shrug I’d pictured. I didn’t mention the coordinates or the thread or the Skinned Man. Saying it out loud felt like daring him to call me crazy.

The noises came back the next night.

Sometimes footsteps. Sometimes light scratching. Once, three slow knocks from inside my closet wall. I’d wake up to find my bedroom door cracked open when I was sure I’d closed it. My desk chair angled a little toward my bed. The curtain caught in a way I didn’t remember.

I kept going back to the thread.

Most of the images were broken, but one blurry screenshot showed an empty street, trees leaning in, boarded buildings. Someone had circled a pale shape in an upper window. Another picture was nearly black; the caption just said:

basement. don’t go down if you hear them

Brightened, it was a gray smear with what might have been a ring of stones.

I started dreaming about a well.

I also kept thinking about stupid, ordinary things about Mason—him drumming on the steering wheel, stealing exactly two fries, the way he always wanted to push “just a little further” any time we explored someplace we shouldn’t.

He pushed too far without me this time.

That’s what finally made me go.

On Friday, I waited until Dad’s truck turned the corner for his double shift. The house settled into quiet. I grabbed my backpack.

Flashlight. Batteries. A folding knife from the junk drawer. Water. Hoodie. Phone charger. Battery pack.

I left a note on the counter.

Went to hang out with Josh. Back later. –L

The drive out of town felt normal. Same stores, same traffic, same stupid songs on the radio. I followed the GPS until it told me to turn onto what looked like nothing—just a thin break in the trees.

The road was cracked, half-eaten by weeds. Branches scraped the car. My signal dropped. Two bars. One. None.

The map froze with my little blue arrow pointed into blank green.

After a while, I passed a rusted-out car in a ditch, nose-down, a tree growing through its sunroof. Faded spray paint on the door read:

D N’T ST P

I drove on.

The trees opened up just enough to show me the remains of a town.

Cinder Hollow.

Main street, small square, a handful of two-story buildings. Most windows boarded or broken. Streetlights bent. A gas station with no pumps. A faded convenience store sign with no store beneath it.

I pulled in behind an SUV with every door hanging open and a pickup that had no bed.

When I stepped out, the silence punched me. No traffic, no planes, no dogs. Even the birds seemed to avoid the place.

The pavement was dusty and cracked. In that dust, I saw footprints. Several sets, different sizes, some sharp-edged, some half-faded.

People had been here.

More signs the further I went: a crushed water bottle with this year’s date on it; a backpack slumped under a collapsed awning; a tripod with no camera. A laundromat with all the washers pried open and forgotten clothes petrified in them. A barbershop, chair on its side, scissors on the floor.

On its door, scrawled in marker:

DON’T LET IT MEASURE YOU

I didn’t want to know what that meant.

A small playground sat behind a leaning fence. Chains swung with no seats. A single child’s sneaker lay on its side in the dirt.

At the end of the street, the town opened into a square.

The church stood in the middle.

Blackened stone walls, vines climbing up them. Broken steeple. Shattered stained glass. The double doors were closed. A red arrow had been spray painted on one door, pointing inward.

Under the arrow:

THIS IS WHERE THEY WENT DOWN

I stood at the bottom of the steps, staring. If Mason had come here, this is where he would have ended up.

Inside. Down.

I opened the door.

It groaned. Cold, sour air rolled out—wet stone, mold, and something metallic underneath.

Inside, light from broken windows showed crooked pews and a shattered altar. Empty water bottles and a dead flashlight lay near the back.

On the floor, words had been carved into the planks, deep and jagged:

NO WAY BACK ONCE YOU HEAR THEM

An arrow scratched next to the words pointed toward a side door behind the altar.

I followed it.

The side hall was narrow and dark. My flashlight-beam picked out peeling paint, old pipes, nothing else. It ended at a set of concrete stairs going down. Above the first step, someone had spray painted:

YOU REALLY DON’T HAVE TO DO THIS

They were right.

I thought about turning back. I also thought about that screenshot of the coordinates and the last message Mason ever sent me.

I went down.

The air got colder, wetter. It smelled like mold and pennies. My footsteps echoed.

Halfway, I heard the first voice.

“Help…”

Thin, strained, floating up from below.

Another voice joined it.

“Please… it hurts…”

Then more, overlapping. Different tones, different ages, all frayed.

“Don’t leave us…”

“Where did our skin go…”

That phrase, out loud, in multiple voices at once, made my stomach twist.

At the bottom of the stairs, the basement opened into a large room. Stone walls, low ceiling with pipes, cracked concrete floor.

And in the center, a well.

Waist-high ring of stones, rusted chain hanging over it. The rim was slick and dark, stained.

The voices weren’t coming from the well. They seeped from everywhere.

“Please…”

“Make it stop…”

My flashlight hit the far wall.

For a second I couldn’t understand what I was seeing.

The wall was coated in flesh.

Red muscle, white tendon, veins pulsing beneath a thin sheen of fluid. It climbed up the wall, across the ceiling, down toward the floor in folds and ropes.

Embedded in it were pieces of people.

Eyes, some open and rolling, some crusted shut. Mouths opening and closing, lips shredded, teeth exposed. Fingers poking out, flexing weakly before the meat swallowed them again. Half-formed faces pushed forward and sank back.

“Help us…” one mouth sobbed.

“Don’t leave…” another gurgled.

Hands reached out of the wall, skinless and shaking.

“Lu…ke…”

My name came from the center.

The mass bulged, reshaping. Eyes squeezed out of tissue, a mouth pulled itself open, features sliding into place in a way that made me want to be sick.

Freckles. Crooked front tooth. A mole near the right eye.

“Mason,” I said.

His eyes focused, bloodshot and too wide.

“It… hurts, man,” he rasped. His voice sounded wet and wrong. “Please… make it stop…”

Tissue pulled at his face every time he spoke, trying to drag him back in.

“I’m sorry,” I said. My throat burned.

“It talked to us,” he forced out. “Said we’d be warm. Said it didn’t waste anything. I thought it was just… an internet thing. Just wanted to see if it was real…”

He blinked hard. Tears mixed with whatever else slicked his face.

“Don’t let it take you too,” he whispered. “Don’t let it wear you…”

The rest of the wall whimpered.

“Where did our skin go…” someone keened overhead.

I stumbled back until I hit stone on the opposite side. My flashlight beam jerked toward where the stairwell had been.

There was no stairwell.

Just solid wall.

I slammed my free hand against it. Rough, damp stone met my palm. I clawed along the surface, searching for any seam.

Nothing.

“You can’t go,” a voice gibbered from the flesh. “No door. No up. Just down…”

Something laughed.

It vibrated through the floor, up my legs, into my teeth. It came from the well.

“New skin…” a voice crooned. Not from the wall. From everywhere. “New skin walked down all by himself. Didn’t even have to be chased.”

The chain over the well rattled and rose, like something was pulling it from below.

“Luke…” Mason gasped. “Run…”

“There’s nowhere to run in the den,” the other voice said, almost cheerful.

The chain stopped.

Something rose out of the darkness.

It came up in one smooth motion, like it was being pushed from underneath. A column of glistening red broke the surface and unfolded into limbs and torso.

No skin anywhere.

Bare muscle, wet and moving. Bones visible underneath. Tendons sliding. The head turned toward me: empty sockets full of twitching tissue, stripped nose, lipless grin full of yellow, human teeth arranged too wide.

Strips of dried skin hung from its shoulders like a cloak. Some tattooed, some small. One bore a faded delivery app logo.

“New skin,” it said. The sound was dozens of voices layered into one. “You heard the choir and came down. You opened the door.”

My legs wouldn’t move.

The Skinned Man stepped away from the well. With every movement, the muscles on its frame crawled, like they were still trying to decide where they belonged. The hanging skins rustled softly.

“Why?” I managed. “Why them?”

Its head tilted.

“Because they knocked,” it said. “They found the road. They followed the numbers. I answered. I like the curious ones. They always come alone.”

It lifted a hand. Bone hooks jutted from each finger.

“Don’t…” Mason croaked.

The Skinned Man turned toward his voice.

“You have so much to say,” it said. “You all do.”

It plunged its hand into the wall.

Every voice screamed.

The sound was one massive, tearing shriek. The meat writhed around its arm. Faces twisted. Hands spasmed. Dust rained down. My ears rang so hard I thought something in my head had ruptured.

The Skinned Man stirred its arm, then yanked it free. Strings of flesh clung and snapped back.

“See?” it said. “Still feeling. Still warm.”

That broke something loose in me.

I bolted.

I ran along the wall, away from the well, flashlight beam bouncing, shoes slipping on damp concrete. In the far corner, a low archway gaped between fallen stones.

I dove through, scraping my shoulders.

A narrow passage. Low ceiling. Pipes overhead dripping rusty water onto my neck. The air tasted like rot.

Behind me, its voice followed.

“Little mouse in the cracks,” it called. “My den is very old. I always find the cracks.”

A metal door sagged at the end of the passage, covered in deep scratches.

I hit it full force.

It shrieked open, and I stumbled into a smaller room with stone walls and a low ceiling. Collapsed shelves. Broken jars. And on the far wall, a stack of crates under a boarded-up window.

Light leaked through the gaps.

Real outside light.

The wall beside the door swelled outward, stone rippling.

I scrambled up the crates. They wobbled dangerously. I grabbed a board and yanked. It held. Splinters bit my palms. I braced my shoulder and pulled harder.

It cracked down the middle.

Cold air rushed in through the gap.

Behind me, stone split with a wet tearing sound. Fingers of bone pushed through.

“New skin wants the sky,” the Skinned Man hummed. “They always think the sky means out.”

I tore at the remaining boards. Wood snapped. Nails screamed. The opening widened.

I shoved myself through.

Broken wood scraped my arms and ribs. My injured shoulder hit the edge. It felt like someone pressed a hot knife into it. I screamed and forced myself forward.

Fabric tore. Skin tore. Warmth spilled down my back.

Then I was falling.

I slammed onto the ground outside on my side, knocked breathless.

The building loomed over me. The window I’d just come through gaped, jagged. Nothing moved in the dark behind it.

For a moment, I thought I’d made it.

Then something pale pressed against the inside of the opening.

A raw, lipless grin.

“New skin…” the Skinned Man crooned from inside the wall. “The hollow is still my den.”

I forced myself up. Blood soaked my hoodie around my left shoulder, hot and sticky. When I touched it, my fingers came away bright red, and pain screamed through the whole side of my body.

I ran.

Streets blurred. Storefronts, wrecked cars, dead signs. I caught flashes: graffiti reading WE TRIED THE DOOR / IT OPENED; a camera smashed on the sidewalk; a jacket caught on a fence, sleeve ripped off.

The dragging sound came again, somewhere behind me. Metal or bone on pavement. Slow. Patient.

I cut through another alley.

Trash cans on their sides, a reeking dumpster, walls closing in. At the end of the alley, half buried in weeds, sat an old blue sedan, windows grimy but intact, tires flat, driver’s door ajar.

I went for it.

I slipped inside, pulled the door shut as quietly as I could. The latch caught. The car smelled like dust and old fabric and something sweet and rotten.

I scrambled into the back and slid onto the floor behind the front seats, curling up as small as I could get. My shoulder throbbed. Blood soaked into the carpet.

Outside, the dragging sound passed the alley mouth. Pause. Move. Come back.

My heart pounded so hard the whole car felt like it was shaking.

I pulled out my phone.

No signal. Battery in the low twenties. Screen cracked.

I opened the notes app and started typing.

I wrote about Mason’s text. The coordinates. The thread. The noises in my house. Cinder Hollow. The church. The basement. The wall of meat. Mason’s face. The Skinned Man.

Every few lines, I stopped and listened.

Once, something bumped the rear of the car. The whole frame shuddered. Rust drifted down.

“New skin…” its voice floated through the metal. “Hiding in dead metal bones. Little mouse in a rusted shell…”

The driver’s handle rattled once, then stilled.

I held my breath until spots danced in my vision.

If anyone ever reads this—if my phone somehow sends this when I’m not looking, or someone finds this car and scrolls through the notes—please don’t treat it like a story.

Don’t tell the kid in your house that it’s “just pipes” or “just the wind” when he says something is walking over his bed at night. Don’t joke about too much internet when he tells you something he read won’t leave his head.

Because if my dad had known what was pacing over my ceiling, what was whispering through the walls, what was waiting at the end of a road with no name, maybe I wouldn’t be curled up on the floor of a dead car in a dead town, bleeding through my clothes while something without skin sniffs at the doors.

The roof above me dents inward with a slow, deep groan.

Bone presses the metal down, leaving a small, round bulge inches from my face.

“Found you,” the Skinned Man whispers through the roof. Its voice vibrates in my teeth.

My phone shakes in my hand.

Battery at 18%.

No service.

I’m going to hit save now, even if it never sends. Maybe this will sit here forever. Maybe somebody will find it. Maybe it’ll just be one more ghost file on a dead device.

If you see anything online about Cinder Hollow, a thread asking where the skin went, or coordinates like the ones Mason sent me—if a kid named Luke ever shows up on a missing poster—

Please.
