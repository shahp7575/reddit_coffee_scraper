1kowmsq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kowmsq,My 4-day trip in Miyakojima,"I have finished a 4-day trip in Miyakojima with my family. Yonaha Maehama Beach is incredible, heaven-on-earth level with pristine torquoise water, very shallow water level, flour-like bright sand and very accessible, just 10 mins drive from the airport. The Kurima Bridge nearby only makes the scene more impressive. 

Some insights (there may be a lot of things I have not known yet though): 

- Tokyu Miyakojima and Hilton Okinawa Miyako are two best choices if you want a resort, with Tokyu sits just next to Yonaha Maehama but pretty isolated from other tourism spots, while Hilton is not close to any major beaches (the Sunset Beach next to it is pretty un-swimmable in my opinion) but is not too far from Yonaha Maehama and Sunayama Beach either. Hilton also offers direct view to the iconic Irabu Ohashi which led to Irabu Island with several beautiful spots, most notable the Toguchi-no-hama Beach and Toriike Pond whereas Tokyu is next to Kurima Ohashi but there are not much things to see in Kurima Island. 

- There are sandbanks literally in the middle of the sea next to Irabu Ohashi, you can book some water sport activities to get there..

- If you do not drive, the most convenient way to call a taxi is by phone, and if you do not have a Japanese phone number, you can simply get into the nearest coffee/restaurant and people will be happy to help. 

- There is a (relatively) big Maxvalu shopping mall in the AEON Town which is located in middle of the island, close to the airport. If you prefer to buy some groceries and enjoy your own meals in the hotel, this is the place to go to. 

- A bus tour is highly recommended as it will cover almost all interesting spots in three islands. There are two different tours which depart of Monday/Wednesday/Friday and Tuesday/Thursday/Saturday, with slightly different stops. 

- As Miyakojima is in subtropical region and very close to Taiwan, it's a good idea to try some mango, sugarcane juices and Chinese-style pork. 


All in all, Miyakojima offers beaches which are not very different from Maldives/Philippines/Thailand ones but with the assurance of Japanese quality. And it's pretty easy to reach, just by a 2/2.5 hour flight from KIX or HND. You should definitely try it once ! ",1,1747498276.0,okinawa,0,1.0,False

Japans camping / hiking communities are vast and new products are always being developed to make enjoying outdoors easier.

The Gaobabu skillet was found on Amazon for 20$ CAD roughly the skillet in aluminum with a non stick coating so oil is not needed and clean up is simple with a little soap and water. The bottom of the pan has grooves to fit pot stands on your camp stove for safety as well.

The second item is the Snow Peak Coffee Dripper, it allows from 4-6 cups and folds flat when not in use. There are other one cup drippers and steepers however this product is made from titanium without and mesh so longevity is a strong consideration in mind when purchasing. It was roughly 70$ CAD from Valhalla Pure Outfitters

1kowl3t,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21422521/,"Coffee might be more stimulating/motivating than Caffeine alone: Coffee, but not caffeine or decaf coffee, increases GCSF levels. GCSF increases dopamine release, increases motivation, and improves cognitive flexibility","Coffee's stimulant and cognitive effects are usually attributed to its caffeine content, while its antioxidant & anti-inflammatory effects are often attributed to the other chemicals in it, which have no known psychoactive effects - like chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, genistein, and trigonelline. However, a paper from 2011 suggests caffeine synergizes with one of those chemicals (or a distinct, unknown chemical) to improve working memory.

The study found treatment of either Alzheimer's-model mice or normal mice with coffee increased plasma GCSF and two immune signaling molecules, IL-6 and IL-10. The increase in GCSF specifically was associated with a working memory improvement in the Alzheimer's mice with coffee. However, caffeine or decaffeinated coffee did not increase GCSF at all, suggesting there is a unique synergism between caffeine and another chemical in coffee producing this unique effect.

Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) is a signaling molecule which mostly acts on bone marrow to increase the production of multiple cell types - however, it also has neurological effects. GCSF was found to increase dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens, a brain structure involved in reward and motivation. GCSF increases motivation to work for a food reward in mice, as well as enhancing cognitive flexibility[1] . GCSF also increases the rewarding effects of cocaine by potentiating cocaine-induced dopamine elevations in the nucleus accumbens[2] . In general, it can be said GCSF stimulates the activity of dopamine neurons in brain regions responsible for regulating motivation and reward.

With these points considered, these findings might imply coffee has a stronger stimulant effect than caffeine alone, due to the unique synergism causing GCSF elevation, finally leading to increased dopamine release in the mesolimbic pathway. Caffeine itself does not increase dopamine release in the striatum by itself[3] , but GCSF elevations induced by coffee might increase dopamine release.",2,1747498150.0,NooTopics,0,1.0,False

The reason I am asking is because it finally came to a head the other day when the two employees tried to convince me they have never had anything that was remotely close to a ""Sugar free vanilla sweetener"" and my drink was a pale tan color.

1kowk7m,https://www.reddit.com/r/StudentLoans/comments/1kowk7m/do_some_people_literally_never_check_their/,do some people LITERALLY never check their financial accounts/student loan account summary pages?,"So in my reddit feed I keep tabs on a number of credit-related subs as well as this sub. I notice the past few months I've been seeing a lot of these ""my credit score suddenly dropped 200 points overnight due to defaulted student loans? what happened?!?""-style posts trickleing in when scrolling down my feed. Another one that is common is the ""but-... but, i moved a couple times over the last 5 years and they sent such and such notice to an old address?"" sob story

It really makes me wonder if there's people out there (...who are full-grown working age adults, mind you) who LITERALLY never check their financial accounts? Like, not even logging into your financial/credit account(s) landing page once a month or so? 🤨

Personally I check my financial accounts multiple times a month, I'm never ""caught off guard"" by an upcoming payment due date or sudden/surprise charges or fees. It takes like less than 2 minutes per account - log in to credit card A, skim thru the ""account summary"" page for any fraudulent/suspicious charges on my credit card, double check that there's no upcoming required payment on the upcoming due date (just takes a quick glance of the eyes), log out. Then I manually rinse-repeat this process for every single financial account (the next couple credit cards, checking accounts, student loans, insurance, etc), it takes maybe 30 minutes at most... I usually knock it out while sipping my morning coffee

And every time I move to a new apartment or whatever, within the very first few days at the new unit I meticulously go thru every single financial account, insurance account, checking account, etc and make sure to update the old address to my new address in the system via the settings/profile page. I also go ahead and update my phone number while I'm in there, if I happen to be on a new number at the time, same thing for updating my email address (if using a new one)

***NEVER HAD AN ISSUE*** with a surprise delinquent/defaulted account notice ""appearing out of nowhere"" on my credit reports... because I actually log into my financial accounts a couple times a month and ""actively"" keep an eye on things

I think the most amusing ones are the ones along the lines of ""huh?? CreditKarma alerts say i'm in default on student loans and my credit score dropped 250 points? bu- bu- but... a few years ago i thought the government said my student loans would magically go away and i didn't need to pay them anymore?"". It's like, dude... 🤦‍♂️

And we're in the era of the smartphone/wireless everything too, which makes these kinds of posts seem that much more silly... in just a few moments you can check on your financial account ""account summary"" page in the bathroom while taking a dump, but apparently people don't even do that? 🤣",2,1747498084.0,StudentLoans,0,1.0,False

1kowjri,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kowjri,"I built an app to read the news, because Apple doesn't want to","Hello Reddit,

For the past three years, I have been developing a news aggregator app called [Newsreadeck](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/newsreadeck/id1593025917). I love starting my day with coffee and news from various sources. However, most similar apps are primarily available in English and cater to U.S. users.

I initially tried using RSS feeds, but many websites don't offer them. Manually creating or finding RSS feeds was tedious. Additionally, RSS feeds often just opened articles in a web browser or displayed only snippets, not the full content.

To address these issues, I developed my own data sources. I've compiled over 16,000 curated sources, categorized by language, location, and topic, which I monitor for reliability. The app allows you to discover and follow sources without limits and access articles seamlessly. I also built a custom reader to remove ads, banners, and distractions, although some paywalls may still appear.

I crafted the backend using Vapor, and the frontend is built with UIKit, RxSwift, and CoreData (old school). While I employed some frameworks, I haven't used SwiftUI yet.

If you enjoy reading the news, [feel free to download the app from the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/newsreadeck/id1593025917). :)

Early checkin charges were 60K but late checkout charges 11 am to 7.30 pm were costly 300K , whole night itself was 500K.

·         We have to give some time for rest in between and it is practically impossible to do the planned itinerary, I realised this late.

·         Hotel bookings were made on booking.com and one hostel / homestay of ninh binh made on hostelworld.com as that had better rates + they have a chat system wherein you can chat with other travellers, though I could not meet any fellow traveller interested to see places with me, if you are lucky you can share the motorbike rental expenses and get a company to take photos and be with you.

·         Always carry small flashlight and umbrella while travelling it will be very useful.

·         Prebook the sim card on Klook it was very useful and you instantly get the sim activated from the kiosk at major Airports. Its cheaper than what the kiosk person will try to sell you. I got mine for 520 rs (some 560 rs with credit card charges) 3GB per day for 10 days with 15 mins local calling.  [https://www.klook.com/en-IN/activity/84066-3g-4g-sim-card-vietnam-noi-bai-airport/?spm=Activity.SearchSuggest\_LIST&clickId=3400c78232](https://www.klook.com/en-IN/activity/84066-3g-4g-sim-card-vietnam-noi-bai-airport/?spm=Activity.SearchSuggest_LIST&clickId=3400c78232) 

 

 

Detailed itinerary :

Day 1 – 6May

Landed in Hanoi at around 02.10 am (Chennai – Kolkata-Hanoi – Indigo) hotel was Mai Charming Hotel and Spa. Since it was odd time arrival had requested for pickup to Hotel itself (14USD I guess converted to VND). Connected to whatsapp and got messages from Driver, sent him message that im in immigration line, my bad luck that my line moved very slowly and other lines moved fast, took almost 45-55 mins for immigration. Driver was getting impatient but was understanding we had language problem as many people don’t understand English.  Finally collected luggage and before arrival came to the kiosk for sim card and got my sim card. The ATM at Airport didn’t accept my card (stupid me forgot to activate international usage)  and I was too tired so thought will figure out things later, I always withdraw money from the Airport on landing, and this time just had some 100 USD with me. While on way to hotel activated international usage on card, and decided to withdrew the amount in morning. Reached hotel by 4 am and paid the room rent + car hire on Card (they charge some 3% extra which is fine) Even for ATM withdrawal you have to pay the fees or markup. While on way to the hotel saw many markets getting busy we passed through some roadside flower vegetable markets and they were all getting busy with Vendors buying and moving stuffs.   Hotel room was very nice and clean only cons was the private jet was so strong I could not use it, would just rip ur xxx, told them to lower the pressure but they didn’t know it. Slept and woke up around 8 , slowly got ready and went down, had a chat with the receptionist and they gave a map of the places around city. I had done my own extensive research. Visited Hoa Lu Prison and easily spent around 2 hours there. Don’t forget to get the audio guide its totally worth and you get a good narration. It was quite sad and depressing to see the way prisoners were treated. After that took walk to the Hoan Kiem lake (my Hotel was in old quarters walking distance from everything). Then went to Hotel in afternoon and rested a while, had a free pvt tour guide booked through my Hotel you can book on trip advisor based on what activities you would like to do. I said to them (Hanoi Free Pvt Guide Tour) that I want to do the Train Street and my guide came at 2.30 itself instead of 2.45 pm. We did walk to the train street and she found a café and a nice spot to view the trains. She also helped click pictures of me, bonus for solo traveller. You have to just buy food / drinks for them and also buy their attraction tickets the service is free. After train street she took me to the Temple of Literature and explained me in detail about the dynasty and how the establishment of the universities was done.  You can book the service here [https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction\_Review-g293924-d11922020-Reviews-Hanoi\_Free\_Private\_Tour\_Guide-Hanoi.html](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293924-d11922020-Reviews-Hanoi_Free_Private_Tour_Guide-Hanoi.html) . After that she left for home and it was evening 5.30 ish time and I had installed grab on my phone and did book my first grab bike ride as we had walked a long way and I was tired. The bill came to 22K and I gave 20K and was searching for the 2K and driver was just like its ok and moved on. Grab bike is best for solo travellers do install Grab bike.  Reached hotel and closed the day, since I had some tiredness from the early morning flight and arrivals.

Day2

Woke up early morning and left Hotel at around 06.30 am to visit Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum it opens at 7 am and since morning itself there is Q. Took around half an hour to walk there, there you have storage for luggage , free and since I took backpack I had to deposit it there and take my purse , mobile and camera with me. Before entry to the Mausoleum had to deposit the camera also , they are very strict and also were scolding people to not take photos. I did take some small videos on mobile but once we were entering into the building where the embalmed body of Ho Chi Minh was kept all guards were constantly monitoring. The building inside had funny smell and I got to witness the embalmed body of the President it was quite a diff experience. After that to visit the Stilt house and house where he worked Security guard only asked me to buy the 40K ticket, they were just letting off Asian people but since I looked diff like tourist and had a camera I was asked to buy the ticket, same was done for museum (40K) seems these places are free for Vietnamese or  anyone who looks like them , other tourists were asked to pay for tickets. Saw the house, cars used by Ho Chi Minh and the stilt house. And then the museum. These all took around 3 hours and left for Tran Quoc Pagoda from Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum by Grab Bike. Saw Tran Quoc Pagoda and then another small pagoda opp to that and then after spending some time there took a Grab to a famous Banh Mi spot in old quarters, they have veg banh mi. [https://g.co/kgs/AeJSjdX](https://g.co/kgs/AeJSjdX) had Banh Mi there and after that went to Giang café to try the famous egg coffee. The egg coffee tasted nice but the after taste of egg was bad. Roamed the old quarters and did some shopping clothes etc. Then went to Hoan Kiem lake and bought tickets for Thang Long water Puppet Show at 4.10 pm, and came to hotel to rest. After resting some time left for the Ngoc Son temple (in mid of Hoan Kiem lake) and then saw the water puppet show with audio guide the audio guide was not that much useful for the water puppet show, but the performance was very nice. After puppet show sat some time in the lake and then went to Hotel.

Day3

Had booked a Limo to Ninh Binh from Hanoi, pickup and drop point to point, 350K VND. One cab collected me from Hotel at 8 am and then collected others and then we were transferred to a different Limo which dropped us to Ninh Binh= Tam Coc. Tam Coc is central place for staying in ninh binh, with all restaurants nearby.  Reached Hotel around 11 am and paid for early checkin and they also gave me motorbike (120K rental per day) The Trang an boating was on my list and I did drove to petrol pump and put some petrol and then drove to Trang an. Always remember to fill petrol only at the big pump and avoid those small roadside shops they will rip you off. My homestay did had good bikes and they had half tanks full. I had filled 50K petrol and the tank became full. Trang an boating I did in peak sun and it was too tiring but a worthwhile experience, I should have tried to do it in a diff time but didn’t know. The route 3 is what I took and it takes 3 hours and was amazing experience. Later I realised I should have done mua caves and trang an in same day and done something else on the first day when I arrived mid day. By the time I finished boating and had lunch at Hotel near Trang an, it was 3 and I was too exhausted. Just came back to Hotel and gave bike keys to homestay lady and said tank is full and will take bike tomorrow. Rested from 5 pm onwards at hotel itself.

Day4:

Woke up early morning and went to Mua Caves (6 am started from Hotel) my bike someone else had taken and finished full petrol so I took a diff bike which had tank full petrol. Mua caves early morning trek was amazing and I did it slow and steady, the view from top was amazing. Around 9 am came back to Hotel had breakfast and discussed itinerary with the homestay lady she said for me to do bich dong pagoda and then go to hoa lu ancient capital and dong am tien.  The parking attendant was cheating and took 50k from me which I realised was scam after sightseeing I did mention to him in google translate that this is incorrect and he returned 25K, atleast something better. Saw lots of reviews saying they cheat, you are not supposed to pay anything but can tip some 10k. After bich dong pagoda on way back went to buffalo caves it was decent ok experience there basically a break place to have free drink in the entry fees and see paddy fields, feed ducks, buffaloes, do fishing and see the natural small cave / pool. After that went to Hoa Lu Ancient Capital, this is most confusing part as entry ticket is 20K only and parking for motorbikes was free but one lady said to buy something from her shop, I said will come and drink, then at entry I saw so many ppl taking two wheelers and asked the guy and he said ok , inside it was tough to navigate as didn’t know where to go at one point when I parked a security guard was asking 10K as parking fees, I skipped and went further to next point. There I found 3 guides who were taking their customers on bike tour of hoa lu ancient capital, I did ask them and one was very kind and said to me to be calm and just follow them they will guide me, regarding charges also they said they don’t need anything, so I just took my motorbike and followed them, all the diff sites in hoa lu are far (kms)

From each other so it took lot of time but since they were expert navigators they know shortcuts and I joined their group. Then in end they parked at the same place and then the guard didn’t ask me money. The diff sites didn’t had any history so we just clicked photos of Hoa Lu ancient capital and there was no description or anything. I was lucky I got a free guide but you can take guide or skip it. Then it was peak after noon so I just went to the opposite dong am tien which has a small hike to cave and a park. [https://maps.app.goo.gl/QhF1vedE9pYA4ebi9](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QhF1vedE9pYA4ebi9) a nice place to spend some time and have lunch , drinks. The cave was very chill and cool like AC. After that I came back to Hotel as I had an overnight train to Da Nang. Rested for some time and then went to train station. The train station was very nice and to let people on platform they check tickets. Train experience was awesome. Always book train tickets only through official website [https://dsvn.vn/](https://dsvn.vn/)

Day5:

Reached Da Nang around 12pm at Hotel and the homestay had my room ready. I did check on Klook [https://www.klook.com/en-IN/activity/13570-marble-mountain-hoi-an-day-tour-da-nang/?spm=SearchResult.SearchResult\_LIST&clickId=4e9b2b453c](https://www.klook.com/en-IN/activity/13570-marble-mountain-hoi-an-day-tour-da-nang/?spm=SearchResult.SearchResult_LIST&clickId=4e9b2b453c) for the afternoon trip to Marble mountains and Hoi An but that was sold out so I shared it to the Hotel person and he said his friend also does same tour for 550K and checked seats and it was available, I immediately booked it. Went to hotel room freshed up came out and had lunch and gave my 4 day clothes to laundry, had already researched and found the laundry nearby, they charged 20K per kg and said will give next day morn 9 am. Then at 3.30 the limo came and started picking people, this is where I met so many other Indians who had come on full itinerary from india through travel agent (80-100K INR per person through diff agents) and in that one family I kept into meeting at other cities also, and guided them on travelling points. We went to marble mountains and saw some places there they also took us to a marble manufacturing factory, the con of having such tours is you cant explore at own pace and have to move in group with guide, but at the same time this is a good vfm tour which makes you see multiple places at budget price with lunch / dinner. We reached Hoi An at 06.30 and had dinner and guide said to us from 7 to 8.30 to explore the night markets and also do boating and walk the lake area. At night Hoi An was amazing, we shared the boating costs amongst ourselves so I had to spend only 55K ( 4 ppl sharing). Left for Danang at 8.30 – 8.45pm and reached Hotel by 9.30 pm. I personally felt the half day tour of Hoi An was amazing as it comes live only in night.

Day6:

Had breakfast, collected fresh clothes from laundry  and it was a slow day, roamed Han market and nearby streets did some shopping, and then came to hotel in afternoon and had little sleep. Past few days were hectic hence it was a relax day. I had planned for Bana hills but then evaluated that its just an amusement park so decided to skip it. In afternoon it started raining heavily and didn’t stop till 5, took long walk along the beach with umbrella and came to hotel, it was Sunday and my last night at Da nang so had to see the dragon fire water show. Started walking towards the son tra night market and after browsing night markets saw the dragon fire water show and came back to hotel.

Day7:

Had breakfast and left for Airport, flight to HCMC at 11.00 am reached HCMC by 1 pm, checked into room and then immediately took grab to war museum, browsed war museum for 2 hours and then started walking towards the Đ. Nguyễn Huệ walking street and also saw the post office on the way and the Hồ Chí Minh City People's Committee building, it was a good place to take photos and then met some ppl from the danang tour and with them went to the famous building of coffee shops and had coffee and donuts at Dosh Doughnuts.

Day8: Had booked Mekong delta tour through Klook  [https://www.klook.com/en-IN/activity/2016-full-day-excursion-mekong-delta-ho-chi-minh-city/?spm=SearchResult.SearchResult\_LIST&clickId=ca508953c7](https://www.klook.com/en-IN/activity/2016-full-day-excursion-mekong-delta-ho-chi-minh-city/?spm=SearchResult.SearchResult_LIST&clickId=ca508953c7)and pickup happened at 8 am outside my hotel, first they took us to Tre and Lua Bamboo and Silk factory wherein we were given demo about the products and they had whole range of products to buy.Then we reached the marina dockyard MY THO MARINA | CẢNG DU THUYỀN MỸ THO

 Wherein were boarded into boat and reached place wherein we were given 5 types of fruits and pandan tea and listened to folk music of Vietnam. Then we had to walk a lot and then board the boat from a diff pier and then it took us to the coconut factory wherein we saw how coconut candy is made and tasted various varities, we also got to taste snake wine and take pics with snake. Then through boating we reached a restaurant wherein we had lunch and there were fishes and crocodiles whom we could feed. Then we had tour of the place through manual boating 3 ppl in one boat and came back. By the time we returned to city it was 3.30. I got off at central market and then browsed ben than market and central markets. Went to winmart at Vincom Centre and bought coffee , tea, snacks etc for home. Reached hotel and packed my goods and had small nap till 9.30 pm then got up and left for Airport at 10.45 as my flight was at 2.40 am.

 

Some of the places which I missed were :

Hanoi: Vietnam National Museum of History   Imperial Citadel of Thang Long  Beer Street Dong Xuan Market.

Da Nang: River cruise , Monkey mountain, lady buddha temple, son tra peninsula,

1kow2cr,https://www.reddit.com/r/islamichistory/comments/1kow2cr/mughal_arts_influence_on_rembrandt/,Mughal Art's Influence on Rembrandt,"
Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn (1606-1669), popularly known as Rembrandt, is arguably one of the greatest artists ever, famed for his myriad creations, which include biblical scenes, resplendent portraits of European elites, and a multitude of self-portraits, intense and nuanced. He was also a printmaker, draughtsman and a keen and voracious collector, acquiring from the world over.

As his career progressed over the years, Rembrandt’s collection grew noteworthy. But the distinction came with a cost. The Dutch painter spent unceasingly, compounding a financial burden that compelled him to declare bankruptcy. Consequently, the municipal authorities of Amsterdam inventoried the artist’s possessions, putting his beloved collection and his house up for sale to pay his lenders.

Among the artist’s voluminous inventory was a slim book listed as item No. 203. It contained curious drawings in miniature as well as woodcuts and engravings on copper of various garments.

The finding opened one of the intriguing chapters in the famed painter’s career, leading to a new understanding of his life and times. And nowadays we are piecing together Rembrandt’s lesser-known works.

“Scholars hypothesize that this album contained Mughal artwork, the ‘miniatures’ that inspired him,” says Stephanie Schrader, curator of drawings at the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, California, who has explored Rembrandt’s ties to South Asia.

According to Rembrandt experts, the artist had never visited India, suggesting he had no direct exposure to Indian culture. Yet he came up with his own versions of Mughal portraits, 25 in all, depicting emperors and courtiers.

Nearly 100 years later, these Mughal portraits, drawn between 1656-1661, came to light when British artist Jonathan Richardson the Elder’s collection was auctioned in 1747.

The album was marked as “A book of Indian Drawings by Rembrandt, 25 in number” and tells the story of the artist’s Mughal connection.

Indian Art in the Netherlands

What was marked as No. 203 in the inventory was just one of a variety of objects originating from China, Japan, Türkiye and India, which was then ruled by the powerful Mughals. Indian acquisitions consisted of cups, baskets, fans, garments for men and women, boxes and some 60 hand weapons. 

But how did they land at Rembrandt’s doorstep? 

The short answer: via the Dutch East India Company (Vereenigde Nederlandsche Geoctroyeerde Oostindische Compagnie, or VOC)’s trading ships that sailed from Surat, a port city in west India. 

“He also collected many objects from foreign countries that came into Amsterdam on VOC ships,” Schrader says, “so his interest in Indian culture wasn’t unusual.” 

The Dutch East India Company arrived in India in 1602, looking out for cotton textiles produced in the southern and western coastal areas of Coromandel and Gujarat. The initial plan was to source textiles to exchange for spices like pepper, nutmeg, mace and other goods in Southeast Asia. However, in the following years Dutch trade expanded unexpectedly, leading to an enormous intra-Asian network, with Indian commodities like raw silk, muslin and opium taking center stage.

“Trade remained Dutch East India Company’s priority. They had permission from the Mughals to begin trading in Surat, Bengal, Coromandel,” notes Robert Ivermee, a Paris based historian of British and wider European colonialism in South Asia. “Textiles and raw silk bought in Bengal and the Coromandel coast were traded in Japan and Southeast Asia, as well as being taken back to Europe.” 

The VOC ships didn’t just carry silk, cotton, spices and opium but also artworks in great numbers. By the early 17th century, art produced in the Mughal ateliers had begun circulating in Europe, with contemporary Dutch inventories referring to works as Mogolese (Mughal), Oostindes (East Indian) or Suratse tekeningen (Surat drawings). Whether Rembrandt owned an exclusive Mughal album is not known, but it is certain that he was inspired by these “foreign” paintings. 

“Dutch East India Company was an incredibly active mercantile powerhouse from the beginning of the 17th century. Exchanges of goods, arts, objects would have been taking place regularly between the VOC and the Mughal court; thus, material goods and objects, including paintings, sketches and artistic renderings would have been arriving in the Netherlands in large quantities, and artists like Rembrandt would have seen and clearly had access to these,” explains Mehreen Chida-Razvi, a London-based art historian of Mughal South Asia and deputy curator of the Nasser D. Khalili Collection of Islamic Art. 

Chida-Razvi says Rembrandt produced “copies” or versions of Mughal paintings between 1656-61, by which point his interest had likely peaked. She adds Rembrandt “existed within a cultural milieu in which awareness of arts of Mughal South Asia, as well as other regions where Dutch EIC traded, would have easily come by.”

Rembrandt’s Mughal drawings

Exposure to the Mughal world translated to a unique phase of Rembrandt’s artistic creations.

In Schrader’s opinion, “Rembrandt was interested in the Mughal paintings as portraits as he was a portrait painter. Mughals were popular figures in Dutch culture, and Shah Jahan was Rembrandt’s contemporary—the Mughals were wealthy and powerful, much more powerful and sophisticated than the Dutch merchants.”

As for the Dutch merchants, this was about a fascination for exotica, an advertisement of sorts that hinted at their power and global outreach. 

“In his earliest works, there is an interest in the exotic as markers of another time, geography and culture,” notes scholar and Rembrandt specialist Amy Golahny. “Familiarity with foreign costumes and customs would have been essential for artists if they were to portray [foreign] subjects.”

Rembrandt drew portraits of Mughal rulers including Jahangir, Shah Jahan, Aurangzeb and Muslim scholars. Shah Jahan seemed to stand out the most, as Rembrandt drew the ruler more than once.

The artworks that are not replicas but rather the Dutch painter’s interpretations still display his remarkable ability to imitate. The final creations reflect a shift in his oeuvre. All the drawings were made on Torinoko, an expensive Japanese art paper, sourced directly from Japan.

Experts portray this artistic departure from Rembrandt’s usual style as a way to reinvent himself. 

Rembrandt himself attached an unusual importance to these Mughal paintings, evident in his exclusive use of Asian paper. Though in the 1640s he often used the paper to print his etchings, it is the Mughal portraits that survive on it today.

“There is more color in Rembrandt’s Mughal drawings than in most of his drawings, so he did imitate some of the color,” Schrader notes, adding that the Asian paper was more refined than European paper and a better vehicle for conveying vivid colors. The artist was fond of experimenting with different papers in his printmaking, so he probably kept it in his studio.

Chida-Razvi says Rembrandt typically worked on a much larger scale than the painted page. “His sketches could have been for self-training exercises as well.”

Golahny’s interpretation throws further light on Rembrandt’s oeuvre at this point. “[The] 1650s is the decade of a varied, meticulously careful draftsmanship, as for example with the Mughal drawings. He also copied equally meticulously drawings by [Venetian artist Andrea] Mantegna. So, he is looking beyond local markers to imagery from distant lands more broadly than only the Mughal miniatures. In both the Mughal and Mantegna copies, Rembrandt is interested in the technique of the originals.” 

Golhany adds that in the Mughal copies, Rembrandt has a fine pen, but his approach is to capture the pose, garment and sometimes the expression of the model without imitating the originals’ fine and closed outline. That is often filled in with opaque watercolor.

Each drawing paid particular attention to postural gait, clothing and accessories. Rembrandt interpreted Mughal styling and never missed the details of the jamas (stitched frock coats), chakdar (full-skirted frock coats, a variant of jama) mostly made of muslin, ornately designed patkas (sashes), jewelry, turbans and their specific ornaments called sarpech, and the embellished jutis (mules, or flat slide-in shoes worn by both Mughal men and women). 

These were alien and culture specific to Rembrandt, yet he included them every time he drew. To highlight the smallest Mughal elements within his otherwise monochrome schemes of brown-wash and gray ink compositions, he used red and yellow chalks and washes of red chalk to color shoes, sashes, turban pins, sword hilts and the like.

He was also interested in the physiological details of his artistic subjects. He meticulously documented Mughal features including noses, beards and moustaches; in one of his Shah Jahan drawings, he produced a white beard, indicating grief after empress consort Mumtaz Mahal’s death. Schrader believes “copying was his way of learning about another style of making portraits.”

When it came to Rembrandt’s interpretation of Four Mullahs Seated Under a Tree, he prominently included new elements in his signature style. Unlike the original Four Mullahs (attributed to an unknown Indian artist, 1627-1628), in which the four wise men are seen discussing spiritual matters while referring to books on a terrace with a carpet laid out, Rembrandt’s version has no books, and the subjects are under a tree. Other minute differences appear, such as the designs of the coffee cups and background settings.

In his print Abraham Entertaining the Angels (1656), which scholars believe is again inspired by Four Mullahs, Rembrandt changes the theme, expanding beyond studying and recording a Mughal composition. He retains the overall essence of his source but details it with newer elements. For Rembrandt specialists this painting serves as undeniable evidence of his Mughal influences.

“After making pen-and-ink drawings after the Mughal paintings, Rembrandt does turn to a flat, motionless language with subtle color; these qualities are found in later paintings,” Golahny says, citing Flora (Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York), Woman With a Pink (Metropolitan Museum of Art) and The Conspiracy of Claudius Civilis (Nationalmuseum in Stockholm).

This distinct set of sketches isn’t well known to most Rembrandt admirers, experts say. “They don’t look like Rembrandt’s work—especially the late work,” Schrader says. “They are atypical and show him working in a much more refined manner than he is known for.” 

But Rembrandt’s connection with the Mughal miniatures reflects his aspiration to know about a world beyond Amsterdam and Europe, which in turn unfolds a story of cross-pollination and intimate learning. His immaculate details of the physiognomies, garments and accessories are telling enough of his cosmopolitanism, thoroughly defining him as a lifelong learner, curious and open.

By drawing the rulers and vignettes of the magnificent Mughal empire, Rembrandt may have been performing an exercise in newer art techniques. Or perhaps he instead was signaling a deep interest in a foreign culture and a sophisticated world.

Unlike the first tasting which was introductory, this one (again alongside my girlfriend and my dad) aimed to highlight the diversity of rum even more, with no country of origin appearing more than once. Also, I tried to include some ""less obvious"" countries of origin alongside the staple ones.

The rums in the tasting and my impressions:

* **Dictador 12:** I am aware of the controversies around age statements and production methods that some rums, including this brand, are a part of. I have also made this a big focus point when explaining about this rum. Personally, I think that it is important to be aware of these things, but that as long as you are, you can also enjoy drinking whatever you want if it suits you, so we ended up giving this one a shot. This rum was sweet, with maple, coffee, and raisins on the nose, and maple, tobacco, and vanilla on the palate, with a very light finish. Nothing spectacular but to be expected.
* **Chairman's Reserve Forgotten Cask:** Interesting nose with a lot of wood, carrot cake, and some mango. On the palate I got pineapple and banana, but also some complex flavors reminiscent of whiskey, with a peppery, oaky, and long finish.
* **Black Tot** **Finest Caribbean:** This one was great and the favorite for me and my gf. Very complex. On the nose, some funk and tropical notes of bananas and pineapple, some very slight smoke, and even marshmallow. Palate had tropical fruit and oak, and a slight wine flavor on the finish. What I loved about this rum is 1. How much the Jamaican component comes through even though it is only 5% and 2. How you can taste each component individually (Guyana, Barbados, Jamaica) while also really appreciate the rum as a whole.
* **Neisson Profil 105:** Wanted to include a quality agricole which obviously felt super different after the 3 first molasses rums. On the nose, seaweed, olives and citrus. Palate had a lot of spices, and particularly allspice. On a side note, I also feel like this is why this rum goes extremely well in a three dots and a dash, highly recommend.
* **Mhoba Bushfire:** Saved the wildcard for last, this one was also great and my dad's favorite (and a very close second place for me). Smokey, woody, grassy, medicinal, with a harsh finish. I felt like the smoke from the charred sickle bush was much more prominent in the palate than on the nose, but nevertheless is is still an awesome experience. Closest I've experienced to a combination of peated whisky and rum, which is of course a plus.

Alright, I know it's been almost a year, but I finally decided to go and resolve the situation. Opinions were divided on my original post. Some called me an AH for taking out my trauma for being bullied, so many years later. Others said while I was an AH, it was justified. Still others said, no excuses for bullying, my former bully who I named ""Slam"" in the post, deserved it.

Well, I decided to give the matter closure anyway. I decided to go and find Slam at the store, talk it out and resolve it earlier today.

I went to the store after lunch, and Slam was doing his rounds, inspecting the sports gear. He looked surprised to see me, and I raised my hands and told him I wasn't coming to cause trouble, but I wanted to talk things out.

I didn't mince my words, I started off with a direct apology. ""I'm sorry for hitting you in the face with that basketball almost a year ago. I have no excuse, I was angry and let past anger just overwhelm me. I failed to control myself, it was my fault.""

He shook his head and his response surprised me in turn, as he said, ""I have no excuse also. I remember what I did back then, and I really was a jerk. One hit in the face, I think I got off easy.""

Then the biggest shock of all - both of us laughed at that.

Slam then said, ""Look, come with me for a coffee. It's on me. I don't know how to patch up everything I did to you, me and the other guys, back then. But maybe we can have a coffee as a start?"" I accepted.

We went to a café in the mall after Slam instructed the supervisor under him to take charge while he was away, and we talked. I showed him some pictures of my family, and he showed me pictures of his. He was glad to know I was in the tutoring industry, and even said that he might send his oldest child (6f) to me for tutoring.

We also found out we enjoyed some games in common - namely, Borderlands 2, Diablo 3 and DOOM 2016.

After the coffee he went back to his work and I headed to my car, on friendly terms. So, yeah - nothing dramatic or surprising, but a dignified and polite resolution to the matter. I was finishing up preparing my tutoring notes tonight, and thought that I'd post this update, just in case anyone was wondering if the matter unfolded any further.

Well, it's done and over with now, and I'm glad to say the shadows of my past have grown a little less dark now.",14,1747496296.0,AITAH,14,0.82,False
1kovv3p,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1kovv3p/am_i_stupid_or_is_this_a_thing/,Am I Stupid or Is This A Thing?,"Let me preface this by saying I (23f) am a pretty awkward and socially anxious person so I tend to  over think everything and assume I've screwed something up.


I've been friends with this guy I met in college for 2-ish years now and I genuinely have no idea what's going on. Note: he's also a similarly shy and awkward person. Our friendship started with talking at school only at events and between classes. 


Rght before I graduated last year, he emailed me his phone number for if I wanted to keep in touch. I emailed him back yes and texted him hi, but he didn't respond so I got kind of embarrassed and asked if he saw my text like a day later. He said yes and that he was busy and didn't have a chance to respond yet. I waited about 3 months to text him again, and he didn't text in those months either.


Since I texted him again, we've been messaging everyday or other day for several months. We kind of just talk about anything. I really enjoy our conversations and I think he's a great person, so I guess I kind of have a crush on him at this point. 


About 4 months after we started texting, I asked him if we could meet up in the summer (meaning this current summer), when he was less busy and he said yes enthusiastically (like with exclamation points). Neither of us mentioned it again until the beginning of this May, when he asked me if I wanted to see Thunderbolts*. I said yes, and so we went to the movie and dinner. Neither of us called it a date, but no one clarified that it was ""just as friends"" either. 

 I had a lot of fun and really enjoyed talking in person again. I tried to smile a lot so he knew I was happy to be there, and afterward, I texted him that I had a lot of fun and really enjoyed talking in real-time and wanted to continue that. He suggested that we go get coffee together, but nothing has been scheduled yet.


I'm sorry if there's not enough details, but is it possible that he is interested in me? Like I said earlier, I am interested in him. I've never been in a situation like this before, so I don't know what's going on. If he asked to start dating, I would say yes. I want to ask him if that's what this is, but I don't want to mess up our friendship because I like talking to him.

TLDR; I've been texting  talking to a guy I met in college for several months and I'm not sure if he's interested. We text almost every day, and have gone to a movie and dinner (with the intentions being very ambiguous) and have plans to get coffee. I'm interested in him, but don't know if he's interested in me.

There's this guy I know who will only buy this one particular kind of sneakers. Like, he's super loyal to them, even tho there are cheaper ones that look almost identical. It's kinda crazy imo. And when I asked him about it, he sorta shrugged and said something vague about quality but never anything specific, ya know?

I wonder if there's more to it than just the product itself. Maybe it's like a status symbol thing, or maybe it brings back some kinda nostalgia or comfort from the past? I mean, we humans can be pretty sentimental creatures, right? Or perhaps it's about aligning with the brand's image or values... even if we don't consciously realize it.

Could it also be about trying to belong to a sort of 'tribe' that gives us a sense of identity? The psychology behind brand loyalty is really fascinating when you think about it. 🤔

Thing is, she's a good kid, she goes school in the day, college in the evenings, and work on free days from college and the weekends. She has her life together, so I don't know if I'm being too harsh?

Her bedroom is a problem, it is never tidy. I've been fighting for a while on it, it started with a Saturday cleaning day, where all my children had to clean their room every Saturday and I would inspect it.

It worked for a few weeks but after a while I gave up inforcing it because it was too much work to get all 5 children up and cleaning. 

After that I decided I'd make a rule where no food was allowed in anyone's rooms. It worked for a while, but my daughter lost a significant amount of weight, I got a bit worried but thought that isn't my fault, if she wants food she goes to the kitchen to make it and eat it. In my house we have no set times to eat, they all fend for themselves (ages: 12,13,17,18,19).

I went away for a few days and left them alone with their father. And I came back today, my second oldest had 2 cups (one from the coffee the day before and one from this morning) And was eating from a plate. I got really mad at her and shut down her computer. She was upset and explained this was her only 2 hours free from work and school/college homework and was trying to play a game with friends, and they were in the middle of a game when I shut it down. She said since it was the only time she had a break from everything she just wanted to eat while playing. I understand she is busy, but then maybe she should put her priorities in eating and making food rather than playing with friends. I told her this and she got mad saying all her friends have been begging to play for weeks and she finally had free time to. She said she doesn't have time to eat unless she can do it while doing homework or while working (her job is online)

I'm starting to feel a little bad, because I know she's a good kid, and she has a lot on her plate, maybe I should stop controlling her so much? And just let her room be as messy as she wants and let her eat in there?

I'm struggling to find connections locally. I'm a pretty shy introvert until you get to know me, which makes finding and getting to know new people a bit of a chore. I moved to a new area and am fucking lonely! I'm desperately seeking a local pal to walk/hike/grocery shop/drink coffee together with.

I like to think a lot. About consciousness. Philosophy of mind, metaphysics, quantum philosophy/ontology. All I do is think think think. I also spend too much time feeling. I consider myself highly emotionally sensitive, so I think a lot about suffering and compassion and cruelty and systems. I'm staunchly anti-capitalist, extremely leftist.

I love music! I have listened to WFMU, tho not as much recently, and get into all kinds of eclectic stuff. Classic hipster fare like YLT, Stereolab, etc. Funk, soul, jazz, electronic music -- Curtis of course, the Meters, Ike Turner, Stax records, experimental stuff like Yasuaki Shimizu, Haruomi Hosoni, Carlos Niño, world/jazzy stuff like Alabaster DePlume, Roberto Musci, kraut/prog rock I guess you could call it, like Can, Woo, Penguin Cafe Orchestra, and 70s gospel choir stuff -- Pastor TL Barrett and the Youth for Christ Choir.

So we come up with reasons—good, bad, or just plain silly—to justify the choice. It's like a little conversation in our heads to reduce that tension.

She had endured five dark, endless years in prison. Today, she was finally free.  
  
Dragging her legs, Lauren hobbled out of the prison, step by slow step.    
  
She moved sluggishly, not because she didn't want to walk faster, but because she simply couldn't.    
  
A black Bentley was parked by the roadside. The window rolled down, revealing a man's deep-set, brooding face.    
  
His gaze swept over her injured leg. He let out a cold scoff, the mockery in his eyes blatant. ""After five years in prison, you're still putting on an act.""    
  
Lauren's heart clenched unexpectedly, and a sour sting rose in her eyes.    
  
Elliot Bennett was her biological brother.    
  
Ever since she had been brought back to the Bennett family from the orphanage at fifteen, she had done everything she could to please him.    
  
Yet for the sake of an adopted sister who wasn't even related to him by blood, he had personally falsified evidence to convict her of attempted murder.    
  
Five years had passed, and he was still as sharp-tongued and as disgusted with her as ever.    
  
Lauren swallowed the bitterness, pretending not to see Elliot as she limped forward.    
  
Elliot's face stiffened.    
  
She had ignored him.    
  
In his memory, Lauren had always clung to him, eager to please.    
  
When he came home, she would bring him his slippers.    
  
When he was tired, she would massage his shoulders.    
  
When he had trouble sleeping, she would bring him chamomile tea every night.    
  
When work kept him too busy to come home for dinner, she would wait outside his office with a thermos, undeterred by rain or shine.  
  
During the three years she had been in their home, his chronic stomach issues had eased. But ever since she went to prison, he had often woken up in the middle of the night from the pain.    
  
Today, he had actually felt a hint of joy when he heard she was being released. He had even postponed an international meeting to pick her up.    
  
He had expected her to be overjoyed at seeing him, had even prepared himself for her to break down and complain about the suffering she had endured.    
  
He had never imagined she would greet him with nothing but silence and indifference.    
  
The admiration in her eyes was long gone. All that remained was distance.    
  
A strange, hollow feeling rose in his chest, irritating him. His grip on the steering wheel tightened, veins bulging on the back of his hand.    
  
His voice came out harsher than he intended. ""Get in the car.""    
  
The moment the words left his mouth, he regretted them. With a frown, he forced himself to soften his tone. ""Dad and Mom know you're out today. They've prepared a welcome-home dinner for you.""    
  
*Dad and Mom. Such familiar yet foreign words.*    
  
In the orphanage, she had dreamed of having parents who would love her, who would spoil her like a princess.    
  
She had waited and longed for it for fifteen years.    
  
Fifteen years later, her wish had finally come true.    
  
She had parents now, even a tall, handsome, and capable brother.  
  
But the beloved daughter of the family wasn't her. It was the adopted daughter they had raised since childhood, Willow Bennett.    
  
Those people weren't her parents. They were Elliot and Willow's parents.    
  
Lauren scoffed at herself.    
  
During those three years in that family, she had endured endless cold shoulders and humiliation. She had always known she was unwanted. There was no reason to go back and subject herself to it again.   
  
Though she walked slowly, she never stopped.    
  
Her indifference, her stubborn retreat, stung Elliot's eyes and ignited a nameless fury in his chest.    
  
He pushed open the car door and strode after her, his long legs easily closing the distance. He grabbed her wrist and yanked her back. ""Have you had enough of this act?""    
  
Thrown off balance, Lauren crashed to the ground. Pain shot through her injured leg, her face turning deathly pale.    
  
Elliot's anger flared. ""Still playing weak? Is this your new trick?""    
  
""Don't forget, you were the one who pushed Elaine down the stairs five years ago and left her in a coma. You even tried to frame Willow for it. Five years in prison, and you still haven't learned your lesson? Looks like it wasn't enough to reform you.""  
  
With that, he grabbed her and hauled her up without an ounce of care. His voice was laced with disgust. ""Don't think your sentence erases your sins. As long as Elaine remains unconscious, your crime will never be absolved. And you still owe Willow an apology. Get in the car. Don't make me say it again.""    
  
Lauren only found it laughable.    
  
She had explained before. Elaine Gray wasn't pushed by her. It was Willow.    
  
But no one had believed her. They had all chosen Willow's side.    
  
She was the biological daughter of the Bennett family, yet everyone had placed their trust in Willow's words instead.    
  
She was guilty, indeed. Guilty of ever returning. Guilty of ever hoping for a love that was never hers.    
  
She had learned her lesson. She would change.    
  
She would leave, far away, and never again fight for the affection of a family that didn't want her.    
  
*Why is Elliot so displeased?*    
  
She calmly pulled her hand from his grip and took a step back, putting distance between them.    
  
Her deliberate withdrawal made Elliot's chest tighten with frustration. His mind flashed with images of the old Lauren, the girl who had once followed him around, desperately trying to win his favor.    
  
Suppressing his anger, he tried to soften his voice. ""Come home with me.""    
  
Lauren lowered her eyes, her expression blank, as if she couldn't even be bothered to look at him.    
  
Her lifeless demeanor made Elliot's rage boil over.    
  
Five years in prison, and if she had learned anything, it was how to grow a temper.    
  
Just as he was about to snap, a warm, gentle voice interrupted.    
  
""Laurie.""    
  
Lauren's body tensed. Her heart, which had been numb for so long, clenched in an instant.    
  
Even after five years, she recognized that voice immediately.    
  
It was Lucas Reed, her childhood friend.    
  
She saw a pair of polished leather shoes enter her line of sight. A deep, magnetic voice spoke above her.    
  
""Laurie, congratulations on your freedom.""    
  
If anyone else had said that, she would have politely replied, ""Thank you.""    
  
But coming from Lucas, the words grated on her ears.    
  
Her most trusted childhood friend, Lucas, had taken on his first case after graduation as Willow's defense attorney, the one who had put her behind bars.    
  
Before the trial, he had said to her, ""Laurie, Willow has never suffered before. She wouldn't survive in prison. Can you take the blame for her?""    
  
*Willow couldn't suffer, but I could?*  
  
Just because she was used to hardship, she deserved to take the fall for a crime she didn't commit.  
  
Sending the real Bennett daughter to prison had made Lucas famous overnight in Hoverdale.    
  
Five years ago, he had still been a fresh graduate, a little green around the edges.    
  
Five years later, he had become one of the city's most renowned attorneys, exuding power and confidence.    
  
They had grown up together in the orphanage, closer than real siblings.    
  
When other kids bullied her, he had always defended her, swearing, ""As long as I'm here, no one will ever hurt you.""    
  
He had promised that when he became a lawyer, he would put anyone who hurt her behind bars.    
  
But later, when Willow had hurt her time and time again, he had dismissed her pain with a casual, ""Laurie, you're too sensitive. Willow isn't like that.""    
  
In the end, it was he, of all people, who had protected the one who hurt her and personally sent her to prison.    
  
...  
  
The air grew heavy with silence.    
  
Lucas' smile slowly stiffened, but he forced himself to extend a hand toward her. ""Laurie, I came to pick you up...""    
  
Before he could finish, Lauren suddenly turned to Elliot. ""You said we're going home, right? Let's go.""



**Chapter 2 Why Didn't They Come?**



Lauren knew she couldn't escape.    
  
Lucas had once been the person she trusted and relied on the most. Now, he was the one she loathed and least wanted to face.    
  
Rather than confronting Lucas, she chose the next best option—going with Elliot.  
  
At least, from beginning to end, Elliot had always despised her.    
  
The first day she went back to the Bennett Residence, Elliot had warned her, ""Even if we share the same blood, in my heart, I only have one sister, and that's Willow. You'd better behave yourself. If I ever catch you bullying Willow, I won't let you off.""    
  
He never gave her hope, so she never had too much disappointment. In front of Elliot, the psychological wounds she suffered could at least be minimized.    
  
It was better than being utterly destroyed by the one closest to her.    
  
Prison had taught her a lesson.    
  
When lacking power, status, or support, survival depended on minimizing harm by any means possible.  
  
So, when her cellmates toyed with her and made her choose between disfigurement and a slap, she chose the slap.    
  
When they made her choose between being beaten and kneeling, she chose to kneel.    
  
When they made her choose between drinking toilet water and barking like a dog, she chose to bark.    
  
She had fought back desperately before, but the more she resisted, the worse the beatings became. To stay alive, she threw away her dignity and let herself be used.    
  
Even when thrown among the most vicious criminals, she had still managed to survive, barely hanging on, by knowing when to avoid harm.    
  
Lauren walked toward Elliot's black Bentley.    
  
As she brushed past Lucas, her expression remained indifferent. She didn't even spare him a glance.    
  
The loose T-shirt skimmed past Lucas's fingertips. The emptiness of the touch didn't feel like fabric draping over a person. It was more like cloth hanging on a lifeless mannequin.    
  
Lucas' hand froze midair. In that instant, it felt like the air around him had solidified, leaving only that cold, hollow sensation at his fingertips.    
  
Pain and desolation flashed through his eyes, and his heart felt as if an invisible hand had clenched it tight, every beat throbbing with dull agony.    
  
Once, her gaze had always followed him, full of trust and dependence.    
  
They had grown up together in the orphanage, supporting each other. Whenever he called her name, she would always smile and answer, ""Luca, I'm here.""    
  
But now, time had changed everything.    
  
She looked right through him, as if he didn't exist, unwilling to even meet his eyes.    
  
Lucas' lips trembled slightly. He wanted to speak, but his throat felt blocked, unable to make a sound.    
  
Lauren got into the car and sat in the back seat. Everything in sight bore traces of another woman.    
  
The passenger seat had a fluffy pink cushion. The dashboard was lined with an entire row of adorable bear figurines. In the rearview mirror, the woman's reflection looked more mature than five years ago, more alluring.    
  
She was beaming, the kind of smile that only someone raised in comfort and luxury could have.    
  
That happiness on her face was like a silent taunt, mocking Lauren as the fake heiress.    
  
She had thought she could face all this indifferently. But seeing it with her own eyes still left a bitter sting in her chest.    
  
Lauren withdrew her gaze, but her eyes inadvertently landed on the handbag beside her.    
  
Inside was a pristine white gown. Even without seeing the whole dress, the intricate feather embellishments hinted at its elegance.    
  
Her fingers unconsciously rubbed against the rough denim of her jeans.    
  
Every detail inside the car reminded her that she didn't belong here.    
  
From head to toe, she wasn't even worth as much as the gown in that handbag.    
  
She turned to look out the window. The scenery blurred past in a rapid retreat.    
  
Elliot, still driving, didn't forget to warn her, ""Mom and Dad have missed you so much these past five years. They cried over you every day, their hair turning gray with worry. When you get home, keep your temper in check. I don't want to see you scheming against Willow again, making things difficult for them. As long as you behave, the Bennett family won't treat you unfairly.""    
  
Silence followed his words.    
  
Hearing no response, Elliot frowned in displeasure and glanced at her through the rearview mirror.    
  
""Lauren, I'm talking to you. Did you hear me?""    
  
Lauren finally looked up at him and spoke the longest sentence she had since leaving prison.    
  
""According to Article 48 of the Prison Law, inmates are allowed visits from family or guardians once a month, for thirty minutes to an hour. I was imprisoned for five years; that will be sixty months. If I had one visit per month, I could have seen them sixty times. But I never saw them once. You say your parents missed me. Then why didn't they come? Were they so busy that they couldn't spare even thirty minutes a month?""    
  
Her voice was calm, but every word was a blade, slicing through his lie without mercy.    
  
Guilt and panic flickered across Elliot's eyes. The reprimand he had prepared was caught in his throat, unable to come out.    
  
Avoiding her steady yet piercing gaze, his fingers instinctively tightened around the steering wheel, his knuckles turning white from the pressure.    
  
""It... It's because you were too hard to discipline. Mom and Dad didn't visit you because they wanted you to focus on correcting your bad behavior. They did it for your own good.""    
  
*For my own good? Letting me take the fall for Willow, making me suffer in prison... So, that's their idea for my own good. What a joke.*    
  
Lauren felt drained, utterly uninterested in arguing anymore. She turned her gaze back to the window.    
  
Before long, the car pulled into the Bennett Residence garage.    
  
Elliot seemed pleased. He grabbed the handbag from the back seat and hurried off.    
  
A few steps away, he suddenly remembered Lauren. His body stiffened, and when he turned back, there was still a trace of awkwardness on his face.    
  
""Go change into a proper gown and head to the banquet hall.""    
  
With that, he left without looking back.    
  
After five years, this house was still as unfamiliar to Lauren as ever.    
  
She had never felt an ounce of warmth here.    
  
This place wasn't even as good as the orphanage.    
  
At the orphanage, she hadn't had a private room, but at least she had shared a sunlit dorm.    
  
When the sun rose, light would pour through the windows, filling the room with warmth.    
  
Back then, she loved the scent of blankets basked in sunlight. It made her feel like she had a home.    
  
But after returning here, she realized that her so-called home wasn't the scent of sun-warmed blankets.    
  
It was the damp, musty stench of a place the sun never reached.    
  
She pushed open the door.    
  
The room was small, windowless, and packed with clutter.    
  
The only two pieces of furniture were a single folding cot and an old desk.    
  
This was the storage room that served as her bedroom for three years.    
  
Elliot had told her to wear a proper gown.    
  
But she had never owned one.  
  
For years, she had only had one set of her high school uniform. The T-shirt and jeans she was wearing now had been bought with money she earned from a holiday job on Amazon, for five bucks total.    
  
She still remembered the day she had happily put them on and asked Elliot how she looked.    
  
His brows had furrowed in disgust.    
  
""What the hell are you wearing? Can't you learn to dress elegantly and properly like Willow? Take it off and get rid of it! Don't embarrass our family.""



**Chapter 3 Canceled Her Allowance**



Willow's poise and elegance had been built with money and resources.    
  
In contrast, Lauren had nothing.    
  
The Bennett family neither gave her much love nor much money, yet they still blamed her for not being poised and elegant enough.    
  
Even now, she didn't understand why they had brought her back.    
  
Her only purpose in this family was to make Willow, the adopted daughter, seem more beloved.    
  
There was a saying, ""Those who are unloved are the outsiders."" It fit her unexpectedly well.    
  
Back then, their unfairness had made her sad. Now, she no longer cared.    
  
She scanned the storage room. The only clothing she had to change into was her old blue-and-white high school uniform.    
  
Five years ago, she had received an acceptance letter from Northcrest University, the top institution in Corwynale.    
  
Yet, the Bennett family had only thrown a grand celebration for Willow's college entrance.    
  
That banquet had gathered every elite figure in Hoverdale.    
  
Eighteen-year-old Willow had stood in the center of it all, draped in a custom-made gown worth millions, wearing a diamond-studded crown, basking in the spotlight like a princess between her adoptive parents.  
  
Meanwhile, Lauren had looked shabby and out of place, an ugly duckling among swans. Under the gaze of the entire crowd, she had been taken away by the police, spending the next five years in prison, losing the college life that should have been hers.    
  
...  
  
Five minutes later, dressed in her uniform, Lauren headed toward the banquet hall of the Bennett Residence.    
  
On the way, passing servants cast curious glances at her.    
  
""Who's that? Why is she here in a high school uniform?""    
  
""She's probably one of the hotel staff brought in for the event. Looks like a student working a summer job.""    
  
""Mr. David and Madam Alice treat Ms. Willow so well. They even invited the top chef from Lavette Grand Hotel just for her celebration.""    
  
""Exactly.""    
  
As one servant walked past Lauren, they didn't forget to remind her, ""The banquet is about to begin. Go change into the standard uniform. You must be careful while serving. Tonight's guests are all important figures in Hoverdale.""    
  
With that, the servant left.    
  
Lauren stood there, suddenly losing the desire to go to the banquet hall.    
  
Elliot had told her that her parents had prepared a welcome banquet for her. But he hadn't mentioned that they had invited outsiders.    
  
Being released from prison was nothing to celebrate.   
  
*Did they really need to make such a spectacle out of it?*    
  
Five years ago, she had been taken away in handcuffs in front of all of Hoverdale's elites.    
  
Now, they wanted to gather those same people and publicly celebrate the return of a convict.    
  
To her, this wasn't a welcome. It was a public humiliation, stripping away every last shred of dignity she had left.    
  
A mix of bitterness and anger surged within her. She didn't want to stay here any longer.    
  
She turned to leave.    
  
But just then, Elliot appeared, his expression darkening the moment he saw what she was wearing.    
  
He strode toward her, his voice sharp with irritation. ""Didn't I tell you to change into a gown? Why did you come dressed like this? Do you have any idea what kind of occasion this is?""    
  
Lauren opened her mouth to explain, but Elliot cut her off mercilessly.    
  
""You looked like a mess when you got out of prison, and now that you're back, you want to put on a pitiful act in front of everyone? Do you want people to think the Bennett family has mistreated you? Lauren, your manipulative tricks are just as disgusting as ever. You're beyond saving.""    
  
As he spoke, he reached out to grab her, still cursing under his breath. ""Go change. Stop embarrassing yourself!""    
  
Lauren sidestepped him.    
  
Elliot's hand caught nothing but air. His anger flared. ""How dare you dodge me?""    
  
Lauren lifted her gaze to meet his. He looked at her as if she were his worst enemy.    
  
That look—disgusted, impatient, filled with contempt—she had endured it for three years in the Bennett family.    
  
Every time their eyes met, it felt like invisible hands were tearing her heart apart. The tears she had once held back had only ever earned her a sneer of ""stop acting.""    
  
Maybe she had gotten used to it.    
  
Or maybe five years in prison had crushed her self-worth.    
  
Now, even as she faced his deep-seated hatred, she felt nothing.    
  
His opinions no longer had the power to affect her.    
  
Lauren's expression remained calm, distant, unyielding. ""I don't have a gown.""    
  
Elliot's fury grew. ""If you don't have one, then buy one!""    
  
Lauren took a deep breath. Elliot was too biased against her. No matter what she said, he wouldn't believe her.    
  
She had tried explaining in the past.    
  
But the more she explained, the more he accused her of lying. He had slandered her without restraint.    
  
It was exhausting. She didn't want to explain anymore.    
  
So she simply said, ""I have no money.""    
  
Elliot's brows knitted together, his rage burning hotter. ""For three years, you lived here without worrying about food or clothing. The company transfers 70,000 dollars to your account every month. Over three years, that totaled 2.5 million dollars. And you're telling me you couldn't afford a decent dress? You're doing this on purpose, trying to make people think our family mistreated you! Lauren, you can't be this selfish. We've already compensated you. Enough is enough. If you keep acting like this, it's just pathetic!""    
  
Lauren had expected this. No matter what she said, she would never be believed.    
  
She stared at him, unblinking.    
  
For some reason, under her steady gaze, Elliot felt a brief pang of unease.    
  
""What are you looking at me like that for? I didn't say anything wrong.""    
  
*He isn't wrong?*    
  
Lauren let out a cold, silent laugh.    
  
She hadn't wanted to make a scene.    
  
But Elliot's aggressive accusations stirred something dark in her.    
  
Out of the corner of her eye, she noticed people approaching.    
  
Since they wanted a commotion, she would give them one.    
  
She had already lost her dignity. She had nothing left to lose.    
  
But Elliot, who cared so much about his reputation, couldn't handle being humiliated in public.   
  
""I never received a single cent from your company. Not 70,000 dollars. Not even seven bucks. Mr. Elliot, if you want to accuse me, at least come up with a more believable lie.""    
  
Elliot's eyes darkened with even more disgust.    
  
""You just won't give up, will you? Fine. Don't blame me for exposing you.""    
  
He pulled out his phone and called the company's finance department, putting the call on speaker.    
  
""Check how much money the finance department has transferred to Lauren's account every month.""    
  
The person on the other end hesitated. ""Lauren? You mean Ms. Bennett?""    
  
""Yes.""    
  
""Mr. Elliot, if you're referring to Ms. Bennett, there's no need to check.""    
  
Elliot frowned. ""What do you mean?""    
  
""Well, we never transferred any money to Ms. Bennett's account.""    
  
Elliot froze.    
  
""That's impossible,"" he said sharply.    
  
*Lauren may not be well-liked, but she's still the daughter of the Bennett family. How could she not have an allowance?*  
  
The night she was brought home, he had discussed it with his parents. To be fair, they had decided to give Lauren the same monthly allowance as Willow.    
  
There was no way he had remembered it wrong.    
  
""I personally gave the order.""    
  
""Mr. Elliot, you might not know this, but Madam Alice said that Ms. Bennett came from an orphanage and had poor judgment. She was afraid Ms. Bennett would fall in with the wrong crowd if she suddenly had that much money. Since Ms. Bennett was a high school student back then and had no major expenses, Madam Alice canceled her allowance.""    
  
Elliot's mind buzzed.    
  
*No allowance... That means Lauren hasn't received a single penny in the entire three years she's lived with us.*  
  
""Oh, and Madam Alice doubled Ms. Willow's allowance to 140,000 dollars a month. She was worried Ms. Willow would feel neglected, so the extra 70,000 dollars was meant to comfort her. You knew about that, right, Mr. Elliot?""    
  
Elliot felt like someone had strangled him.    
  
He had not known.



**Chapter 4 You Have No Idea**



As the crowd grew, more and more people gathered around, all having heard the voice coming from the telephone receiver.    
  
Everyone present was stunned.    
  
The Bennett family wasn't the richest in Hoverdale, but it was still a prominent aristocratic household.    
  
For children of wealthy families, having a monthly allowance of 14,000 dollars was perfectly normal.    
  
They had never heard of a wealthy heiress who didn't even get a single cent in allowance.    
  
The Bennett family was the first.    
  
No wonder Lauren dressed so poorly, without even a decent gown to wear to a banquet.    
  
Even if she hadn't been raised by their side, she was still the real daughter of the Bennett family. Yet they gave her nothing while showering their adopted daughter with 140,000 dollars a month.    
  
For the Bennett family to allow such an outrageous situation to happen, they must have been utterly blind.    
  
The guests whispered among themselves. Elliot felt a chill down his spine, his face flushing with shame and anger.    
  
He refused to believe something so humiliating could happen to the Bennett family.    
  
Their family was wealthy and powerful. There was no way they would be too stingy to give their own flesh and blood a mere allowance.    
  
Elliot immediately questioned Lauren in a cold voice, ""Even if the finance department didn't transfer the money, Mom and Dad must have given you an allowance, right?""    
  
Lauren's lips curled in mockery. She glanced at David Bennett and Alice Pierce in the crowd and said lightly, ""Why don't you ask Mr. David and Madam Alice whether they gave me an allowance or not, Mr. Elliot? After all, you don't believe me, but you'd believe your parents, wouldn't you?""    
  
David and Alice stiffened instantly, too ashamed to meet her eyes.    
  
""Dad, Mom, you must have given her an allowance, right?"" Elliot looked at them seriously.    
  
David avoided his gaze. ""I thought you guys would give it to her, so I...""    
  
Alice's face was filled with guilt, tears welling in her eyes. She said painfully, ""I thought you guys would... Laurie, why didn't you say something sooner? If you had told me earlier, I would have given you money. It's my fault. I didn't realize it in time, and you suffered for it. But you have to believe that I treat you and Willow the same.""    
  
Lauren looked at her with a half-smile, her gaze indifferent. Under her cold stare, Alice lowered her eyes awkwardly.    
  
Only today did Lauren find out that it was her own birth mother who had ordered the finance department not to send her money. Not only that, but she had also raised Willow's allowance to 140,000 dollars, afraid that her precious adopted daughter might feel slighted.    
  
With such blatant favoritism, Alice still had the audacity to claim she treated them equally.    
  
As the esteemed wife of a wealthy family, Alice wore only the finest clothes, with even her socks costing dozens of dollars. There was no way she couldn't tell that her own daughter was wearing an outfit that cost less than 14 bucks in total.  
  
Of course, she knew. She just didn't care.    
  
This apology was nothing more than an act for the public.    
  
Fortunately, Lauren had long seen through the ugliness of this family. Her heart had been hardened, immune to their poison. Without expectations, she remained unshaken.    
  
Seeing Lauren ignore her mother's apology, humiliating the Bennett family in front of everyone, Elliot's fleeting guilt instantly vanished.    
  
He scolded coldly, ""You have a mouth, don't you? Why didn't you just say something? We're not mind readers; how were we supposed to know what you were thinking? If you had spoken up earlier, do you think we wouldn't have given you money?""    
  
""I did."" Lauren's voice was soft but laced with coldness. ""You just didn't take it seriously.""    
  
Elliot frowned, about to deny it, when a memory suddenly surfaced in his mind.    
  
It was an afternoon long ago. Their family of four sat on the couch, chatting and laughing.    
  
Lauren walked over hesitantly, clutching the hem of her school uniform. Before she even spoke, her face flushed bright red.    
  
She struggled for a long time before finally whispering, ""Dad, Mom, can you give me the tuition fee of 700...""    
  
*Bang!*    
  
Elliot slammed his newspaper onto the coffee table, glaring at Lauren. ""Money, money, money! Is that all you care about? Did you come back to this family just to ask for money? If the Bennett family had no money, would you have even bothered to return? I don't know why Mom and Dad insisted on bringing you back. If you have nothing better to do, go study. Willow ranked tenth in the whole school in her first monthly exam. What about you?""    
  
""I... I got first place....""    
  
""Enough. You mean dead last, right? And you still have the nerve to bring it up?""    
  
He had already arranged for the finance department to deposit 70,000 dollars into her card every month, yet she dared to open her mouth and ask for money.    
  
Even Willow didn't receive that much, so she had no reason to think she deserved it.  
  
Lauren's tears fell instantly, as if she had suffered a great injustice.    
  
Elliot only felt irritated, even losing the mood to read his financial newspaper.    
  
Luckily, Willow was understanding. She tugged on his arm and pouted. ""Elliot, I ranked tenth this time. Do I get a reward?""    
  
He couldn't resist his sweet little sister acting cute. Instantly, all his annoyance from Lauren disappeared. Pinching Willow's cheek, he doted on her. ""Willow, what do you want?""    
  
""I saw a handbag worth 14,000 dollars. Elliot, will you buy it for me?""    
  
""Of course. If you like it, I'd even buy one for 140,000 dollars.""    
  
After spoiling Willow, he turned back to Lauren with a scowl. ""Why are you still standing here? Go back to your room and study.""    
  
Lauren bit back her grievances and ran away.    
  
David and Alice sighed at the same time. ""If only Laurie were half as sensible as Willow.""    
  
...  
  
""Mr. Elliot, have you remembered?""    
  
Lauren's voice pulled him back to the present. His heart twisted painfully at the way she addressed him—Mr. Elliot.    
  
He was her biological brother, not some stranger.    
  
But ever since she was released from prison, she hadn't called him by his name even once.    
  
His expression darkened, his voice laced with frustration. ""It was because you were terrible at studying. Coming in dead last, how did you have the nerve to ask for money? Even I was embarrassed for you.""    
  
Hearing this, Lauren's gaze turned even colder. Being stared at with such icy indifference, Elliot felt an inexplicable sense of guilt. He clenched his jaw and snapped, ""You don't accept criticism?""    
  
""For all three years of high school, I ranked first in my grade every year. How did I suddenly become in last place in your version of the story?""    
  
Seeing Elliot's expression of utter disbelief, Lauren smirked coldly. A sense of vindictive satisfaction rose within her. ""Then again, it's understandable. Mr. Elliot, you don't even know which school I attended. Naturally, you wouldn't know my grades.""    
  
Elliot felt like he had been struck by lightning, frozen in place.    
  
It was as if he had just heard something absurd. His voice trembled slightly, betraying a hint of hoarseness. ""You weren't attending Brightvale High School?""    
  
Brightvale High School was the most prestigious school in Hoverdale. Willow had graduated from there, and all the wealthy and powerful families in the city sent their children there.    
  
Elliot had simply assumed Lauren was studying there as well.    
  
His gaze snapped to David and Alice, his voice shaking uncontrollably. ""Dad, Mom, when Lauren came back, did you transfer her school records over?""    
  
Silence.    
  
David's face turned red, his lips moving soundlessly like a man who had lost his backbone. All his past authority vanished.    
  
Alice's lips quivered. Panic and guilt filled her eyes, her perfectly applied makeup unable to conceal her embarrassment.    
  
The two stood there, frozen, as if the air around them had solidified.    
  
Elliot's face turned pale, inch by inch. His previous perception of Lauren crumbled like a collapsing tower. All the disdain and condescension he had once felt now twisted into sharp blades, cutting into his own heart.    
  
His throat tightened painfully, his voice barely audible. ""Laurie, where did you go to school for those three years?""



**Chapter 5 Her Birthday Party**



Lauren's life had already been ruined, and only then did Elliot remember to care about her academics. How ironic.    
  
She had spent ten years studying desperately, hoping to change her fate. Just as her efforts were about to bear fruit, she found that they were ultimately no match for power.    
  
With a single, offhand remark, the Bennett family sealed her fate, effortlessly casting her into the deepest depths of hell.    
  
She could have had a bright future.    
  
From childhood to adulthood, she never had the advantage of a powerful family background. The only thing she could rely on was her extraordinary dedication to her studies.    
  
Her dream was to get into Northcrest University, then pursue a master's degree and a doctorate. She wanted to become a professor, to stand at the podium and use her knowledge to change the fate of those who, like her, worked tirelessly to succeed.    
  
But reality had slapped her in the face.    
  
She did not become the person she had wanted to be. Instead, she became a despised criminal, forever marked by a stain on her record.    
  
A stain that would affect three generations.    
  
Thinking of this, Lauren clenched her fists so tightly that her nails dug deep into her palms, but she felt nothing.    
  
""Hoverdale First High School."" Lauren's voice was soft, almost gentle.    
  
Yet the four words, ""Hoverdale First High School,"" weighed like a thousand-pound boulder, making David, Alice, and Elliot feel as though they could hardly breathe.    
  
Because Hoverdale First High School had the highest admission standards in all of Hoverdale.    
  
Unlike Brightvale High School, a prestigious private school where admission was secured with money, Hoverdale First High School only recognized scores, not wealth.    
  
Even among top students, she had consistently ranked first in her grade year after year. With her grades, getting into Northcrest University had been a certainty.    
  
""That's impossible. You're lying."" Elliot's emotions were on edge. ""Hoverdale First High School is in the suburbs, more than 20 miles from home. Back then, you rode that old bike every day...""  
  
Mid-sentence, Elliot suddenly realized something. The rest of his words got stuck in his throat.    
  
Watching the color drain from Elliot's face, Lauren's lips curled in mockery. ""I'd rather ride a bike than go to school with Willow. We never even attended the same school. I never ate breakfast with you because morning classes at Hoverdale First High School started at six. I had to wake up at four to bike for two hours just to get there. I never came home for lunch because there wasn't enough time to bike back. I didn't have money for food, so I just drank more water to hold on until evening. By the time I finally got home, you had already eaten. All that was left for me was cold leftovers, and even then, you mocked me, saying I had a lowly fate, that I preferred eating scraps over hot food, that I devoured leftovers like a starving ghost...""    
  
""Laurie, I'm sorry."" Alice's tears fell like broken pearls, her sobs heart-wrenching. ""I didn't know you suffered so much. It's all my fault.""    
  
""There's nothing for you to apologize for."" Lauren looked at Alice's tear-streaked face, her heart as calm as still water. ""I wasn't raised by you. It's understandable that you feel nothing for me. I've long been used to this. A little more suffering wouldn't have made a difference. Don't you agree, Madam Alice?""    
  
Alice's sobs hitched.    
  
*Laurie, I'm begging you. You're stronger than Willow; you can endure hardship. You took care of yourself just fine in the orphanage, so I believe you'll manage in prison too. Please, take the fall for Willow.*    
  
A five-year-old memory came surging back. Alice looked stricken, clutching her chest as if she were about to faint.

CHAPTER 1

Gasping, I woke up with my scream stuck in my throat. Sweat running down my temple, I ran towards the bathroom turning on the shower, not caring about the cold water freezing me up.

Sliding down the shower wall, I rocked back and forth, hoping to forget about my nightmare. Willing to do anything as long as it wipes out of my memory. But I know its not possible. After god knows how long, I got up and dressed, hoping a cup of coffee might help, knowing sleep was out of question. Looking at the time, it was 3 o'clock in the morning.

On my way to kitchen, I made a stop to the door opposite of mine. Opening it as quietly as possible, I saw Kyle, my best friend sound asleep. Thankful for not waking him up, I shut the door and went to get that coffee. Kyle has been with me since we were 5 years old. He knew everything that happened to me and helped however it was possible. He is my lifeline, my brother, and most importantly my savior.

I started working on my coffee when I saw a stack of mails on the counter. Having nothing else to do I took my coffee and my mails to the living room and got comfortable on the couch. Going through a bunch of bills and useless papers, I came through one mail that had me frozen on the spot. With shaking hands, I peeled off the flap and took out the paper that could either give me immense happiness or great distress. Reading the every word carefully, a huge smile took over my face. Not caring anymore I ran straight to Kyle's room and jumped on his bed with the loudest squeal ever coming out of me.

""What the fuck Maya?"" Kyle screamed wide eyed but as soon as he saw the smile on my face, he let out a deep breathe

""I got it Kyle. Look, I finally got it."" Shoving the paper down his nose, I jumped up and down the bed.

Running his eyes over the paper, Kyle turned his wide surprised eyes towards me and let out his own squeal. ""You got it. Oh yes, finally.""

""I know right? EJF industries has finally given me the job. I cant believe it. God I wanted a break for so long and finally I got it."" I gushed, a dreamy tone that can rarely be heard by me.

""You deserve it babygirl. God knows you do."" He pulled me in a bone crushing hug which I returned happily.

""LETS CELEBRATE"" Kyle screamed letting me go and running around the bathroom as if he didn't just wake up. That's the thing about Kyle, he can't help but he happy about me and I cant help but love him even more

""Kyle its 3:30 in the morning, come back to bed and sleep. We can celebrate tomorrow""

""Wait a minute"" Kyle walked back into the room with a stern face and I knew something has had him pissed. And I knew that something was me. ""Why are you awake? Did you have a nightmare again?""

I looked down towards my lap guiltily, my fingers twisting together, a nervous habit. ""No?"" I replied timidly knowing how Kyle gets when he finds out about my nightmares.

He ran towards and and crushed me to himself ""Why didn't you wake me up? You know I would have helped?""

Pulling back, I looked anywhere but him ""I know, but you haven't slept properly yourself for the past week and i didn't want to disturb you.""

Taking my chin between his fingers, he pulled my eyes towards him ""I'm never to tired or you babygirl"" He said softly.

i couldn't help but stare at him. Kyle was an attractive guy with light blue eyes and olive skin. His well build body and 6 feet was drool-worthy and whenever we were out, girl threw themselves on him. Though, he wasn't into that. You see, my Kyle was a proud gay and that broke a couple of hearts when girls found out he would rather kill himself then be with them.

""Come on, lets sleep. You have a big day tomorrow."" Kyle whispered and pulled me with him on the bed. Cuddling me to him.

I sigh in contentment, feeling safe with him. Knowing nothing can harm me as long as he is right there beside me.

It didn't take long for the darkness to takeover and lull me back into sleep.

I woke up, finding myself alone in bed. Jumping out of bed I went to the bathroom in my room. Taking care of myself and brushing my teeth. I went to the kitchen and found a note near the coffee machine. 'GONE TO WORK. THE BREAKFAST IS IN THE OVEN. EAT IT. AND BE READY BY 8 TONIGHT. WE'RE GOING OUT TO CELEBRATE'. I let out a sigh and had began with my breakfast.

I went over all the things that needed to be done today. But the most important was quitting my current job. I shuddered, knowing I have to deal with Max, My boss. Well soon to be ex-boss. He was a creep. There was no other way to describe him. When I first started working out, not a day went by he didn't try to feel me up. He deliberately choose the sluttiest uniform for the waitresses.

A tight busty white shirt paired with the shorted black short that can easily be passed as an underwear.

If it wasn't for financial crises, I would have left that disgusting place a week later. But you have to do what you have to do. And now finally I have the opportunity to leave that God forsaken place and work at EJF, a place I wanted to work at since the past 3 years.

Taking the last bite, I hurried to take a shower and got ready. Rushing towards my car, a nissan micra k11. I got in and drove straight towards Max's pub. The place i wish i could torch it to the ground.

After 20 mins, I shut the door and went straight in, not bothering to greet anyone. Wanting to get this over with.

I knocked on Max's office and entered when I heard a murmured come in. There he sat, with his big rounded belly and bald hair patch. I couldn't help but wince when he shoved his chair back with a screech and sat back with a smug smile on his face when he saw me.

""Well well, there you are. To what do i own this wonderful pleasure? Isn't it your day off?"" He said with that creepy ear screeching voice and his smile got huge showing he bright yellow teeth when he saw me flinch. The asshole loved to see us squirm .

I walked over to his desk and with my chin help up and shoulders straight i announced ""I quit.""

I had he pleasure of watching his smile turn into a grimace. He straightened in his chair and said with an ugly sneer ""You cant quit. We are low on staff and we need you. Now get your juicy ass in the gear and get on with it.""

""I'm serious Max. I quit. I got another job. But thank you for taking me in when I needed work"" I said politely wanting to take the high road and leave with good grace.

A small disgusting smile tuned up on his face ""Why yes, I did you a huge favor. Why dont you thank me the way I want you to baby?"" And within a mere second he unzipped himself and pulled out his nonexistent dick.

I couldn't help but gasp, My mouth opened wide with horror as he started stroking himself with a smug smile on his face. I couldn't stop the angry that burned inside me. Every single thing this bastard has made me suffer came rushing back. The touching, the slaps on the ass, the inappropriate comments. I turned around and locked the door

As soon as he heard the click, Max started laughing, thinking he was finally getting what he wanted ""Come on baby, daddy's ready for some lovin."" I turned around and looked over his nasty office and finally found what i was looking for. I went straight towards his collection of baseball bats and lifted one that was hard enough to hurt but not do any permanent damage.

As Max saw what was in my hand, he paled, stood with his with his in front of him and started stuttering ""Lo-look y-you dont need to do-do this""

Not caring i rushed towards him and hit him hard on his legs hard causing him to fall and kept on hitting him anywhere that i could. There was a sudden bang on the door as I heard someone screaming to open the door. Maybe they heard Max's pussy ass screams.

I dropped the bat after i had my fill and took a note of Max's condition, The poor old jerkface could hardly breathe. I squatted beside him causing him to flinch. ""Hope you know not every ones gonna take your shit."" I stood up and turned towards the door and unlocked it. Kate, my good friend and another waitress here came rushing inside. As soon as she saw what happened she burst out laughing. I couldn't help but join in. She took my arm and rushed me towards the bathroom.

""What the fuck happened? Not that he didn't deserve it"" Kate asked as soon as we entered the bathroom

""I told him I quit and he wanted me to thank him for letting me work when i needed to by sucking his cock. I was done with his shit so i taught him a lesson"" I said nonchalantly fixing my hair by looking in the toilet mirror. Kate stood by me and started chuckling fixing her mascara and lipstick ""I hope he doesn't become a much bigger problem now""

""Fuck him. Danny will handle him"" Kate said. Danny being the pubs bounce and Kates boyfriend. ""Wait. Why did you quit?""

""I got the job in EJF. In starting tomorrow."" I said with a huge smile on my face

Kate let out a small scream and pulled me into a hug, jumping up and down. ""I'm so happy for you. You wanted that job for ages"".

I pulled back and couldn't help but share her excitement ""Yeah. Kyle and I are going out to celebrate. Join us?"" I asked, knowing there was no way she would say no.

""Hell yeah, I'll meet you there. Just text me the time and place. I need to get going before fuckface wakes up loses his shit.""

I started laughing and pulled her out of the bathroom and gave her a hug. ""I'll see you tonight""

""You will. And please dress sexy"" Kate said with a stern face

""I always dress sexy"" I said with a pout

Kate rolled her eyes and went through the hallway to get to work, throwing over her shoulder ""Sure you do"".

I laughed, shaking my head feeling weirdly at peace, knowing I wont have to see this place again.

# Chapter 2.

CHAPTER 2

Getting ready for going out, I pulled out my all time favorite dress which I only kept for special occasions. Red dress with a sexy twist front bodice with light padding makes my big breasts more highlighted. The dress fit me like a glove showing off my curves which I am most thankful to have. I looked myself in the mirror one last time before going to check on Kyle. That guy take dressing up to a whole new level.

Hazel eyes met mine as I looked in the mirror. Hoping this was sexy enough for Kate. I'm never up for showing my body. Makes me feel weirdly odd and uncomfortable. But today is a happy and for once I do wanna have fun. Forget about everything. My plump lips covered in bright red lip gloss making them seem soft and shiny. My 4 inch black heels making my 5'4 height tall much taller. Giving myself a final look and went towards Kyle's room hoping hes ready.

""Kyle come on. Lets go Kates wai...."" I trailed off as soon as I entered. My eyes wide as I looked all over his room. I should be used to this but i couldn't stop myself from being surprised as i saw clothes everywhere and Kyle sitting on the bed in only his boxers

""Kyle what the hell? Why aren't you dressed?"" I walked over him careful to not get his clothes dirty with my shoes.

""I cant find anything to wear"" he pouted, looking at me with those eyes that i can never get mad at.

I looked around and picked out some clothes that make him look 10 times more hotter and shoved it towards him.

""But i wore this shirt last time we went out."" he whined but one look from me was enough to get him running towards the bathroom.

I started picking up his clothes and folding them knowing he wont ever do it. After 15 minutes Kyle walked out of the bathroom looking no less than any GQ model. I couldn't help but stare at him and feel proud knowing he was my best friend.

""I look weird"" he said sullenly and i couldn't help but smack him behind his head. ""Ow, what was that for?

""You look fucking hot now stop trying to pull out compliments from me. We're getting late"" I said walking out his room and getting my purse and mobile and walked towards the main door. ""Kate is going to be so pissed.""

""Relax, she won't hurt you"" He said, wrapping is arm around my shoulder and pulling me to him. ""I'll protect you"" He said giving me his most charming smile and i couldn't help but smile back.

Walking into Spades, one of the most Elite club, I couldn't help but wonder how we got in. All Kyle had to do was say something to the bouncer and we were walking through the next second.

""How'd you do that? What did you say to him"" I asked astonished to how easy it was to get in here.

""Did you offer to suck him off? I bet that would get you into the VIP section as well"" Kate said cheekily shoving Kyle with her shoulder.

Kyle burst out laughing making me giggle. Kate had no filter whatsoever but she was a sweetheart if she liked you. ""No. I promised to take him out. I met him 2 weeks ago in a coffee shop. He told me he worked here and that his name is Eric and he kinda asked me out. I didn't say yes. but didn't say no either. So here we are.""

I wouldn't help but smile as he turned around and winked at Eric.

""Come on lets celebrate"" Kyle said wrapping his arms around both Kate and I. ""Our best friend has finally gotten her dream job. We need to get drunk.""

Rushing towards the bar where Kate ordered 9 shots of tequila. I couldn't help but laugh out loud at Kyles face as Kate told him what happened with Max. He slowly turned towards me with a look of pure shock ""You? Maya Campbell? Who won't even kill a a cockroach, beat the ever loving shit out of your ex boss? Who are you and what have you done with my sweet innocent Maya?"" He asked in mock outrage. I started laughing along with Kate as I told him about how it started. Though we were laughing I could see some concern in his eyes and couldn't help but reassure him.

""I'm fine. Max is all bark. The moment he saw I had the bat he almost pissed his pants. He didn't even try to defend himself. Screamed louder than a girl. I can look after myself Kyle."" I told him wrapping my arm around his waist giving his a side hug.

""I know. But I'm always going to worry babygirl."" He smiled softly down to me.

""Okay enough with the mushy mushy stuff. We are here to get drunk and get Maya a very hot guy to fuck."" Kate announced and I started choking on my spit.

""There is no way i'm fucking anyone. Ever."" I said with enough authority and swallowed my drinks one after the other. Knowing it was gonna take much more than 3 shots to get me drunk.

""Oh come on Maya. It has been a year since Tom. You need to move on. And whats that saying. The best way to move on is to get under someone else."" Kate said dismissing my death glare.

I looked at Kyle for some help but all he did was look the other way. ""You agree with her?"" I asked shocked, my mouth wide open. How dare he? I turned my glaze towards Kate and saw a very huge smug smile on her face.

""Lets forget it. Forget Tom and getting laid. Today is supposed to be a happy day. Come on lets dance."" Kyle said trying to defuse the situation. As always.

Kate shrugged and turned around going to the dance floor and Kyle turned towards me with a hopeful look in his eyes. Rolling my eyes I said "" You go ahead, I'll join you both in a minute.""

He smiled and walked towards Kate, who was dancing like she owned the place. She already had a queue of people drool over her. She was a real beauty with fiery wait length red hair, green forest eyes and cute freckles that made her look what she really wasn't. Sweet and innocent. But all in all what mattered the most was her heart. She had the biggest heart anyone could have and she really showed that to those she truly loved.

Weirdly, I felt a burning feeling on back. I turned my gaze around when suddenly my eyes met one of the most intense eyes I've ever seen right across the club. He was looking straight at me, like wanted to look deep in my soul. My body shivered all of a sudden and my eyebrows furrowed in confused. I never had this sort of feeling with anyone before. Not even Tom. I cocked my head to the side when I realized he seemed a bit familiar but was hard to place with the amount of dim lighting his place had.

I was broken out of trace as soon as I felt a hand tap my shoulder. I turned around and came face to face with Danny, Kates boyfriend. I smiled huge and pulled him to a hug. ""I'm so glad you're here Danny.""

We pulled away and he smiled softly at me ""How could I miss such a celebration. You're finally getting what you wanted. I'm proud of you Maya"" I couldn't help get tearful at hearing that. I never heard that before except fro Kyle and it meant a lot.

""Thank you Danny. It means a lot.""

""So I heard what happened today""

""Oh God""

""Why didnt you tell me Maya? You shouldn't have to deal with that crap bag."" He said sternly with his arms crossed but I could see his lips trying to turn up.

""I'm sorry but I was just done. And I really wanted too hit him."" I said between laughter.

Suddenly Kate came rushing towards us and jumped Danny and I knew that was my cue to let them be. I turned around and came face to face with him. Mr. Intense. I couldn't hold my gasp as I realized how close he was. But once I looked at him, I couldn't look away. He was the most gorgeous man I had ever seen with the most beautiful intense steel grey eyes and that chiseled jaw sharper than any I've seen before. He towered over me with his 6.4 height, I guess. But he was taller than Kyle.

""Hi"" He said in that deep voice that had me squeezing my legs tight. Which of course he saw and gave me a knowing smile.

""Hi"" I said breathlessly and immediately frowned. What is wrong with me? I'm never like this. I stood straight with my chin up and gave him a sweet polite smile.

""Do you might me buying you a drink? I couldn't help but notice you don't have any. Its not quite acceptable to have such a beautiful woman here without one."" He said with his more than perfect smile.

""You have beautiful eyes."" I blurted. Oh fuck. Why did I say that?

""Holy shit Maya!"" I heard Kate murmur under her breathe and I couldn't be more mortified. Those tequilas have officially ruined my life. It really does takes me 3 drinks to get drunk.",1,1747495841.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

The building there turned out to be closed, but I decided not to be discouraged, so while drinking coffee at a gas station I opened a map and looked for what else to see within a 50 km radius. And I found this mansion. A beautiful place, surrounded by a very overgrown garden, which in fact turned into a forest. I walked through it all, from the first floor to the attic. It was surprisingly quiet and nice to be there.",31,1747495776.0,abandoned,1,0.97,False

I matched with this guy who seemed pretty cool - into hiking, coffee enthusiast, and had a decent sense of humor, or so I thought. We decided to meet up at this cozy little coffee shop he suggested.

Now, I'm all for deep conversations, but this date took an unexpected turn. Like, I was prepared for small talk, but he dove straight into territory I was not expecting. Within the first 10 minutes, he started unloading about his existential crisis and family drama. I mean, I came for a latte and some flirty banter, not a Ph.D. in psychology! 😂

Honestly, I just sat there nodding, sipping my coffee, and trying not to look too much like a deer in headlights. Tbh, by the end, I think I knew more about him than his therapist did. Part of me wonders if he even got my name right... who knows. 

In the end, it was kinda hilarious, and I couldn't help but chuckle as I walked home. Maybe I've missed my calling in life as a therapist? 🤔 Either way, online dating has definitely taught me the importance of boundaries, or maybe just the ability to change the subject real quick. Cheers to more caffeinated adventures and hopefully less surprise therapy sessions! 🙌",1,1747495776.0,OnlineDatingStory,0,1.0,False

My wife and I (early 30s) just relocated to Denver (Park Hill) from Seattle a few weeks ago. Our little one is almost 5 months old. I usually take her out for a walk in the morning before work (8am) or in the morning on the weekends. Trying to give my wife some freedom back in her life! I also selfishly love the one-on-one time in the morning.

Anyone game to get a walk group going? Low key, low pressure. I usually make a cup of coffee or walk over to Honey Hill. We love just to walk around the neighborhood. Really no prerequisites other than being a dad and bringing your kid. I’m good with whatever your interests are, your age, whatever your income is, or the amount you even want to chat. Quiet walks are fun too. We are just out here strolling around and enjoying the trees, birds, and weather.

Leave a comment if interested! Maybe we can get a small group going 1-2x/week or something. Additionally, for the moms out there, I can pass along info to my wife too lol.",19,1747495762.0,Denver,3,0.79,False

RTO stole 10 hours a week from my work life balance, my family and most importantly, my dogs! The best part is that my reports are all over the state of Texas so I sit alone in my office waiting to log on some days on TEAMS. Other days, I am sitting in my office taking phone calls. This is inefficient and costly to the state of Texas. I have been mobile since before COVID. Nothing has changed. My work is excellent. I meet my employees accordingly to department policy and I am in the field meeting with stakeholders. Now after all of the hoopla about getting the state employees raises it will all go to gas and wear and tear on our cars. This makes no sense. Truly the only thing that makes sense is that if I have to RTO for a Texas agency where I am in the car 2.5 hours a day, I might as well get a job closer to home for less money and less stress, disorganization and more compassion for their employees…. 

Excuse me sir, would you like cream in your coffee? Would you like a chocolate croissant or almond. Have a nice day! See you next Monday! Sounds way better than sitting in a state office doing a job for 5 people!  I might make more $$🤔

Grab a coffee and start your day off with some optimism. Each morning, I will share a few recent optimistic news articles in various sections so you can start your day off in a hopeful mood rather than being all doomy and gloomy.

1kovgue,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1kovgue/i_was_number_100/,I Was Number 100,"I know what you’re thinking, but please understand, the options for a father to connect with his teenage son are pretty limited. You’ll see it if you’re lucky, you won’t if you’re smart.



It was part of our daily ritual by this point. We’d sit at the dinner table, I’d yell for a bit, until the kid took his eyes from the phone and the phones from his ears, I’d ask “What’s so damn interesting in there that you can’t be bothered to look at the people at this table?” Turns out that, on one particular night, it was actually interesting.



The kid argued the gorilla would f-up the humans, while I, so invested in the discussion that I let the f-bomb slide, argued it didn’t stand a chance. My wife’s face glitched, her body unsure if it should roll its eyes at the idiotic discussion between the men of her life, or squeal in joy that, for once, the dinner table wasn’t a battleground for a never ending intergenerational war.



The following weeks were a furious exchange of articles and video-essays. “Settling the 100 men vs gorilla debate once and for all”, “Zoologist reacts to “Settling the 100 men vs gorilla debate once and for all””, “MMA Fighter reacts to Zoologist reacting to “Settling the 100 men vs gorilla debate once and for all””, “Ancient warfare expert (trust me bro, true expert 4real, no cap) destroys MMA Fighter reacting to Zoologist reacting to “Settling the 100 men vs gorilla debate once and for all” with facts and logic”.



It was stupid, but, then again, between your student debt, deadlines, petty squabbles and the 3rd credit card cloning false alarm this week, when was the last time you allowed yourself to be stupid? “I can’t wait to see his stupid face when he fumbles whatever lame excuse he’ll come up with this time.” It was a mix of familiar and unfamiliar. I knew what it was like to be excited to go home and see your son, I missed it; I didn’t know the feeling of wanting to destroy your own flesh and blood, it was a thrill. We bantered, we exchanged shoulder punches. The kid has really grown, he can punch really hard. Don’t tell him, but his punches hurt and I was OK with that.



\-Wanna settle this once and for all? - He asked me one night.

\-Sure. - I lied.

\-Sunday. I’m sending you the e-vite. - The kid said, while reaching for his phone; the rule of “no phones on the table” long forgotten to the annals of history.

\-Prepare to swallow your words, kid.

\-Don’t worry, I’ll be there to pick your face from the ground, old man.



As I settled in my T and boxers under the sheets, I took a look at the event the kid sent me, a gathering at some distant field where the “Battle of Primates” was supposed to happen. By then my wife’s conflicting emotions had settled on an annoyance that cost me more than one opportunity to get laid and my son more than one scolding by less than solid justification. It didn’t matter, we were having too much fun.



So it took me a bit by surprise when she said with genuine concern:



\-Aren’t you two taking this a bit too far?

\-Why? Cause we’re considering going to some dumb gathering?

\-Are you seeing where this is supposed to happen?

\-Yeah, according to Google it’s a four hour drive, but it’ll be fun. Two guys on a road trip.

\-He is not “some guy”, that’s your son; you’re supposed to stop him from doing something stupid, not let him convince you to do it with him.

\-What’s the worst that can happen?

\-You’re seeing the description, right? “101 primates come in, only one comes out”.

\-It’s just some meme, don’t take it literally.



Truth is, I had zero idea what all that was supposed to mean. I’m part of the generation that had to carve emojis out of qwerty keyboards and imagination, the reach of internet phenomena has long surpassed my feeble comprehension, both in resourcefulness and brainrotness. All I knew is that I wouldn’t shut it down, I didn’t want to.



Sunday came and, first in a long time, I didn’t have to drag the boy back to the land of the living. After leaving my bed, I knocked on the bathroom door and yelled something about not hogging all the hot water, partly to reinforce my parental authority (yeah, right), partially to start the banther right away.



Since my plea for my wife to prepare us breakfast was met with a gaze that prompted me to silently reply “Understood, ma’am. I choose to remain among the living.”, I cooked it with a care usually reserved for mother’s day and the kid ate it with surprising gusto, despite the pancakes being a lot more soggy than I intended.



We packed for the trip with all the extent of our combined survival skills, that being the equivalent of an apartment’s cat, an orange apartment’s cat. A thermal of coffee for me, a cooler of energy drinks for him, an ungodly amount of jerky for both, no water to be found anywhere.



\-Since when do you listen to Epica?

\-Since I learned what Simone Simons looks like.

\-That… makes perfect sense. You *are* seventeen.

\-How bout you? It’s not like I’ve ever seen you listening to Sabaton.

\-Swedish Pagans is fine, but Joakim is no Bruce.

\-And who is?

\-Look for something called Everybody Dies.



(…)



\-That?

\-Yeah, the green one.



(…)



\-That’s… pretty good. How do you know this stuff?

\-Remember your uncle Fernando?

\-The one with the hair that grew everywhere but down?

\-This one. I was a bit younger than you when he jumped out of the bushes asking “Hey, man. Ever heard of Avantasia?” I answered “No, is she hot?” He replied “Anyway, I’m a bass player short for my cover.” I’ve been listening to metal ever since.

\-You had a band?

\-Yeah.

\-You play?

\-Yep.

\-Where is your bass?

\-I sold it.

\-When?

\-Remember when you put on braces?

\-Oh…

\-It’s alright. I hadn’t played in a long time by then.

\-Why not?

\-The band broke up when we got into college. Ever since, between college, job, your mom, you, it was hard making time for it, so I didn’t and playing alone is pretty boring.

\-Still, why don’t I see you headbanging around the house?

\-Your mom is not a fan, so I listen when I’m on my own, usually with headphones.

\-How do you make it work when you can’t vibe to the same tunes when you’re doing taxes, getting scammed by AI or whatever you millennials do?

\-With an ancient magic, forgotten by you gen zers: patience. There’s always one or another thing in each other that gets on your nerves, you just gotta be smart about it.

\-That can’t be right, you’re not divorced.

\-Very funny, little man.

\-I mean, you’re dumb enough to get a bunch of jerky and not a single drop of water.

\-I didn’t see you putting any water in this cooler of yours.

\-I’m in high school, I’m supposed to be dumb. You’re forty, you’re supposed to know shit.

\-So, you’re free to do dumb shit and I have to be smart for the both of us?

\-Yeah, you’re a dad.

\-If I was that smart, I wouldn’t have such a dumb son.

\-Yeah? Well… I…

\-No response? You know you can’t start a yo mama battle.

\-Sure I can, you are the one who’d have to buy me a car.

\-How so, dumb shit?

\-You badmouth mom and I stay silent, for a price.

\-Right. Go on then, say how Nana Helen is fat or something.

\-Don’t feel like it.

\-Thought so, Sim’s simp.

\-Like you didn’t simp her before mom.

\-Of course I did. But that’s different.

\-How, old man?

\-We’re the same age. You’re simping for a woman as old as your mom.

\-So? MILFs are hot.

\-Yeah? You daydream of being her little spoon after you waste my money on tissues?

\-Fuck you, dad.



It was a nice trip, better after we stopped to grab some overpriced water bottles. The event itself was… confusing. Lots of people running around talking to their phone’s cameras and taking selfies, without much from which I could grasp what the hell we two were doing there. At some point, I think there was a notification on my phone or someone shouted something, anyway, we ended up on a line.



\-Ninety eight, ninety nine, one hundred… We’re full!



We found ourselves inside an enclosure with a guy in some cheap monkey suit, except he really sold his movements, I’m talking Andy Serkis in Planet of The Apes stuff, super realistic. I could almost believe this was a real silverback, because, surely, it’s not like some internet randos would get their hands on a real gorilla, much less put it to beat a bunch of strangers for internet points, right? Right?



I looked at our target, chilling with a bamboo snack or something and a bowl of water. If it was trying to pass as a game’s final boss, it was failing miserably. A guy stood out of the crowd and started taking steps towards it. It didn’t take notice, but kept snacking. Once the idiot was closing the final distance, the cosplayer spited a jet of water into his face and the idiot backed off in shock and embarrassment.



The people laughed hard and loud, the gorilla didn’t like it. It lost its chill and let out a loud, low growl and stood up erect, beating up its chest.



I was starting to think my wife might have possibly been right.



\-What’s the plan, dad?



Full disclosure: I may have used a tiny bit of poetic license when describing my martial prowess to my son as he was growing up. Back when he saw me as some sort of god, it was cute seeing him echo my words in his my-dad-can-beat-your-dad discussions, it was less cute seeing this evolve to my-dad-can-beat-your-400-pound-gorilla.



\-Remember that ancient magic we were talking about?

\-Patience?

\-Yep. We stay away and wait for it to tire out.

\-Sounds good to me.



It was a wise plan, problem is I forgot my own wise words from earlier, gen zers do not know patience. The gorilla strolled through the crowd, who made waves like a school of fish dodging an incoming shark; but sooner than later, an idiot, thankfully not my idiot, rushed forward the gorilla’s back and kicked it in the nards.



The animal flinched, so did the other ninety nine primates. An idiot, my idiot, rushed towards the aggressor, grabbed him by the collar and threw him against the fence of our enclosure. I rushed towards them, hoping to use my four decades of accumulated wisdom to stir the crisis to its optimal conclusion. Upon reaching them, I pulled my right hand back and drove it across the not-my-idiot’s stupid face.



\-Motherfucker, the hell is wrong with you???

\-Bruh, who kicks someone in the balls?? - My son added.

\-Hey, if you don’t fight dirty, you’re not fighting to win. - The imbecile defended himself. I drove my palm across his face again.



Soon enough, there was a crowd gathering opposite the idiot, screaming insults and putting into question his worthiness of sharing the air with the poor, innocent silverback and the rest of us primates. Whoever was in charge of this mess, thought it was time to pull the plug and a group of large men stepped into the enclosure, doing their best to contain the rowdy crowd, while the idiot was rushed into a getaway car and fastly drove into the distance.



My son and I sat at a corner, aggressively biting chunks of jerky, mumbling insults at the imbecile and daydreaming of all the ways we would teach him a lesson, if only those cowards hadn’t denied us our righteous reckoning. After the adrenaline weared off, we chugged a bottle of water each and my son turned to me:



\-Care to look if there’s a store around selling bass guitars?

\-I don’t think your mom would like that.

\-Not if it’s for you, but if it’s for me, she might be ok with it.

\-You wanna learn to play?

\-Sure. You can do it, how hard can it really be?

\-Three months of daily practice and burning fingers till you can make something resembling music, six months till you can actually play the stuff you intend to.

\-Fuck that!

\-Steak house?

\-I’ll look at Yelp.

1kovga1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Petloss/comments/1kovga1/my_samoyed_girl_is_gone_and_i_fear_it_will_never/,my samoyed girl is gone and I fear it will never get better,"This Tuesday (13.5.) I lost my samoyed girl, who would turn 11 next month (12.6.). Her name was Kira. I’ve lost family members before, and family dogs together with other animals, so I thought I knew what grief was, but nothing prepared me for this. She was my baby. With cheeky personality and the sweetest smile. All those nicknames I called her are stuck in my throat. I did not even know of the samoyed breed back in 2014, but when I walked past a shop on my way to work one day I spotted the most beautiful dog staring back at me through a glass door. I remember searching on google later that day „big white dog“, then I began searching for puppies available. Three months later we brought her home, a little polar bear. I loved how friendly she was with everyone she met, strangers and especially children always wanted to pet her. Her crunching a carrot was so cute and funny.

Anyway she was an older dog so I knew we have at best just a few more years with her, and sometimes I could not stop myself from thinking of her passing when I watched her sleep. She had a cough last winter, and we treated it the same a human would, it was nothing serious and soon she was better again. So when she started coughing at the beggining of March I thought it was the same thing. It sounded like she wanted to get out some phlegm more than anything, and she was still very active – simply herself. We did the same thing we did last winter: the regime, the medicine and vitamins. She was not even coughing every day, so I thought she might be getting better. Me and my partner also cought a nasty flu and the recovery was slow, so when she did not stop it was already April when we could take her to our vet.

They did an X-ray and saw something on her right lung. The doctor prescribed antibiotics in case it was a pneumonia, but warned us it can be a tumor and said to come for a CT scan next week, the last day of April. We did and beside that they took a lot of samples from her, it was very expensive. It was not a pneumonia. The vet said he was hopeful, that it looked like it could be the better kind of tumor so we could cut a part of her lung and she could live on. He said he did this surgery on his own senior dog, and he said her results will come in a week. But a national holiday was the next day so they could not send the results, then a weekend came, then another national holiday. We called after a week when no one called us, but the results still did not come.

The thing was she started deteriorating a lot after we took her home after that CT scan (30.4.). Her cough was different and horrible, getting progressively worse with each day. It seemed it took a lot of strenght out of her. As the days went on she could not longer lay down comfortably, she only had one position she could sleep in. She slowed down, no running anymore, just one pace. She spent a lot of time sitting while dozing, or she went to put her chin on a coffee table to sleep. Her tongue sometimes seemed a bit blue. I think I did not want to see certain things back then. I was just holding onto hope, onto that call from our vet, and told her again and again just to hold on.

For more context this is not a good year for me. I never felt like a lucky person, but I’m not pessimistic by nature. I struggle with chronic pain and mental health, amongst other things depression and anxiety, suicide ideation, you get the picture. This January my uncle left us by his own choice. A house of people I know burned down. A husband of another woman I know unexpectedly died. Family relationships are not ideal, with a few narcissistic individuals trying to trump each other and create more drama just because. And the state the world is in right now is just a cherry on top. I cannot describe you the stress I was in during that waiting period, when I knew there was nothing I could do to help her. Then last Friday (9.5.) father of my partner suffered a massive heart attack and we and the doctors thought he will not live through the weekend. And my dog started to eat less and less. I wished I would just die.

The vet called this Monday (12.5.) that some results came and they are fine, but the rest did not come. We told him how bad it was and he said we will do the surgery the next day. He did warn us that there is a chance that he will open the chest and find out that it spread, and it will be bad. We knew, but we refused to think about that. She did not eat much for dinner, but she did take treats from me. On our way there she was laying in my lap, and I think it was kind of our goodbye. She seemed comfortable for once, and I kept snuggling her. When we parked I told her she must come back, but if she cannot I will not be angry, I will understand. I could not go with them, I would not be able to leave her there. The last time I saw her my partner was carrying her into the building, she did not want to take the stairs by that point.

I feel so cursed because a few hours later I mentioned something along the lines how the waiting is the worst and suddenly the vet was calling. He said he opened her, and the cancer was everywhere – lungs, heart and I don’t know where else. He said she was sleeping now, and he could just deepen it. We stood there like scalded and agreed. He told us the rest of the results came, and it confirmed what he was seeing - very aggressive cancer. He told us it would not matter if we came sooner. She underwent a surgery a few years ago because of a nonmalignant tumor on her mammary glands, and I immediately thought of that, I thought we were being lucky once, but it cought up with us now.

It was weird after that, surreal. We broke down in our car, there was too much to feel, to think about. We tried to just do what has to be done for now. We went for her body. The vet and the suff were very nice. It was when she was in the car with us again that I could calm down a little, it felt right to have her back. We took her back home so the two family dogs could say goodbye, and any other family member if they wanted to, because we took her to pet crematory next. I took her fur and my favourite whiskers, and kissed her goodbye, she still smelled the same. I could not calm down, it felt like they were ripping a piece of my body when they took her.

The next three days are a haze, I now don't remember much. I ate a little but I did not feel hunger, I was in my bed or on a couch mostly and my brain just offered me either a supercut of her cute moments, or the horrible times from the past two weeks, and both was horrible. I was drowning in longing, and also in guilt (because I did not do enough, I was not there with her when she passed, and she is now laying in a freezer somewhere), I could not hold it in when I saw her white hair on the carpet or my clothes, stuff like that. I rememer the way she moved, the way she sounded, and I expected to hear it any moment. It could not be gone if I remember it to such a detail, right? I kept asking myself out loud ""where is she?"", and ""why is she not here with me where she belongs?"". The house felts so empty, seeing just two dogs instead of three felt wrong. It really came in waves as everyone says, unpredictably. Time moved like a snail. I had the worst meldown in a shower the third day for some reason, I ugly cried for so long and it hurted to the point I vomited. 

My partner took days off from work because we thought we will be caring for our baby after the surgery together. He was with me the whole time, and I found solace in his embrace at first, but later I just wanted to be alone. The fourth day when I woke up I felt different. My mind was like it was stuffed with soft cotton, it was not exactly pain, but pressure still. And I no longer saw only my furry baby before my eyes. I noticed when I tried it was like my brain took my chin and made me look away. I was not myself, and I’m still not. I can use my body, I can say what I want, yet I feel like I’m in a mecha suit. As if it was not me looking through those eyes like before, but I was sitting in the back of my head, watching from a distance. I cannot describe it. I watched videos with her, photos… and felt nothing. No tears came, nothing.

You see I am a very emotional person, a crybaby you could say, and my partner finds it hard to talk about his feelings, he did not cry even when his beloved grandfather died. Yet he cannot collect himself now, his eyes are always red. It's a very strange and new situation for both of us. His father thankfully turned out to be a miracle, getting better each day to the point even doctors don't get it. But it feels bittersweet. And now I feel like a monster, I even envy my partner that he can still cry. I cannot make myself feel anything. Everything I do or say feels like a farce, like I’m just a robot. I don’t know where my baby went, and I don’t know where I went either. Is this how the life will be from now on? I have no desire to do anything, to plan anything, the time I'm spending like this feels pointless and wasted, and I feel like nothing can make me happy or ""normal"" again.

I am sorry this is so long. English is not my first language so if you see an error in grammar please forgive me. I have to say it does feel a pinch better to know there is such a big community of people who feel similar to me to some extent, because most people irl don't get it.

1kovf8f,https://www.reddit.com/r/EstrangedAdultKids/comments/1kovf8f/lowkey_hiding_from_my_mother_in_my_hometown/,Low-key hiding from my mother in my hometown,"I am back in my hometown--a small college town--for the first time in more than five years. My best friend's mother died, and I'm here to support him and attend the memorial. My own mother still lives in town. Probably unsurprising, but I have felt an enormous sense of obligation to spend time with her while I'm here.

This despite the fact that she has been an inexplicably large a\*\*hole over the past few years, doing stuff like picking an unprovoked fight with me over I-don't-know-what during Thanksgiving dinner. That, and more generally doing everything in her power to avoid interacting with me in a meaningful way. Her strategy is to talk constantly about nothing at all, using words like an invisible shield. It’s depressing. More than that, it pokes at my soft spots because it’s obvious that she’s afraid of me: what I’ll say to upset her, which skeleton I’ll try to dig up this time. It gets at that familiar “hi, I’m the problem, it’s me” feeling.

My therapist often says things I don't understand. This time, when I told him I really didn't want to see her, he asked, ""Why do you have to? You're not there to visit her, you're there for your friend."" I found this observation incomprehensible (and still do), but I try not to dismiss his insights out of hand, especially given the fact that I'm pretty sure he's right even if I don't want to accept it.

I compromised by making the trip as short as possible and then spending a few weeks fretting about what to do before finally breaking down and telling her I was coming--three days before I was due to arrive. I didn’t want to keep the visit a secret, and keeping it a secret in this town would have been a practical impossibility anyway. To her credit, she took it in stride, didn't jump all over me about the short notice, and said she would prepare a bedroom for me. She's been pleasant and accommodating so far, but her verbal shield is all the way up. Meanwhile, I’m sitting at a coffee shop writing this post and feeling guilty after having snuck out of the house while she was walking her dog.

It only now occurs to me that maybe I should have written a post about this visit long before now. 😊

I have no takeaways from this experience other than that it’s really hard to figure out what you’re willing to tolerate as an adult with eyes wide open. Are you willing to be attacked over nothing? Or maybe to spend a few hours listening to someone who clearly is unwilling or unable to interact with you in a meaningful way? It would be wonderful if she and I could have a visit during which we shared a positive emotional connection. I know by now that she doesn’t have it in her. And yet, here I am, low-key hiding from her, still trying to figure out what I can tolerate.

I came here to see what my fellow hate watchers think. Maybe these are hot takes, maybe not. But man, this show is so dysfunctional and my husband won't go full gossip girl with me on it. 🙃🤣

Taya, I feel like she was an outsider until she realized how to best control and influence people through hypersexuality. I would not be shocked if she has inserted herself in a group that might already have people that lack clear confidence, boundaries, and a fantasy element for bonus escapism when she reels them in. Like, if this show were one of those LARPs, she would absolutely stir the pot by triangulation then if called out, use the excuse that it was ""just in character and they need to separate that from out of character""...just pure gaslighting. (This might be a hot take, but man she has these weird vibes). You know she would be a nightmare at a DnD table, omg. 

For women, she probably tries to pretend to be their friend. Then like the show, she takes every opportunity to get digs in and start disturbing the peace. They become self conscious, eventually kissing the ring, especially if she won the men over so they'll defend her. Any women she's with? Probably young, curious, and easily fooled. I bet Sean is in on it, too (he has very trynna strike a chord and it's probably A minor energy). 

When she gets the women nice and insecure, this creates issues in the relationship and then she can swoop in as the ""understanding"" friend that just inherently knows the right thing to say (by weaponizing what she knows ofc). From there, it wouldn't be hard to guess what comes next. 

Legit, you just know she was that girl who said she was your best friend and would offer you a shoulder to cry on as you vent about how terrible your boyfriend is. She tells you to be strong and not put up with it, the entire time? She's making a mental list to use against you later. Why? Because she likes competition and ""winning"" at the expense of everyone. Then when the time feels right? She does that fake confiding bit and oops, they're smashing. When the inevitable break up hits, she starts a campaign to oust you from the group while trying to use therapy buzzwords the entire time. You KNOW she's a PMAB. 

Everyone else? 

Alysia is definitely one of the easy prey type women I described above with a dash of trying to keep her jellyfish of a man at the cost of everything and everyone. Like, girl...get a backbone and some self respect. She's out here crying every episode and tries to tell us she's loving this. Like there's no way in hell that she actually wants any of this. 

Tyler? My dude, this is just cheating with extra steps, like wtf. Unless your wife has a humiliation kink? You're a wholesale dick trying to pull off that whole ""sensitive, naive, and cutesy hipster who goes to the coffee shop and plays Hey There Delilah"" thing. Add to that, massive cuck energy with Sean. How are you letting this man tell you what to do! I REFUSE to believe he's a Dom with either woman. 

Sean? Well...yeah. That's that on that. 🙃

Sorry for the wall of text but I just cannot understand how four people who for the most part hate each other sacrifice all else so Tyler and Taya gladly throw them in front of every bus they can find before running off and trying to buy an ankle collar that doesn't look like it was purchased on sale off Temu. 🤣

By day, I dance with code. By night, I’m a soul trying to unravel the secrets of atoms. I’m on the path toward a PhD, so my evenings are filled with equations and coffee-fueled study sessions (TOEFL & GRE adventures included). Life can be intense, but I find peace in the small, quiet moments.



What Am I Looking For?

A companion to slow down time with—someone I can dive into real conversations with, free from pressure or expectations. Whether it turns into a deep relationship or a solid friendship, I’m seeking moments woven with trust, laughter, and presence.

My Everyday Escapes:

Late-night talks that stretch into the early hours,

Spontaneous walks through quiet streets, getting lost in little cafés no one notices,

Motorcycle road trip dreams across Europe: open roads, fresh air, and a playlist we build together.



Hobbies & Curiosities:

I’m on a fitness journey, discovering the healthiest version of myself—inside and out.

I’m also designing my first tattoo. Got a favorite design or a story behind yours? I’d love to hear it.



What’s Your Story?

If you’re emotionally grounded, curious, and kind—if you sometimes get lost in silence and aren’t afraid to share your weirdest thoughts—then you might just be in the right place.

If even one line here made you smile or feel seen, say hi. Or just tell me one tiny thing that made your day a little brighter.

Here’s how I broke the loop with just these 3 simple habits","A few months ago, I realized I wasn’t building anything real

I’d open YouTube “just for 5 minutes”… and 2 hours later I was deep into tech explainers, productivity gurus, startup story rabbit holes. I told myself it was learning. But truth? It was procrastination in disguise.

My ""watch later"" list became a graveyard. My ideas? Half-cooked. My MVPs? Stuck in Notion.

I live in Vietnam. I don’t know many indie dev around me. Most people want a safe job, not to ship software alone for strangers on the internet. But something in me wanted to try. To make something useful. To finish something.

So I did.

\> I launched my first product microsaas [VidSummify](http://vidsummify.pro/landing) this week (Launched on product hunt 5 days ago)  
It’s a simple AI tool that solves a problem I personally had: wasting hours trying to keep up with too many YouTube channels.  
Now I get one clean email each morning with the important stuff, summarized. No chaos. No guilt.

I read dozens of self-help books, but nothing changed.  
**Only action works**.

What changed?  
It wasn’t some magic productivity system. Big system = Hard to apply. so, my system was only these 3 lessons:

* 5-Second Rule: If there’s a hard task I'm just not doing when I'm corp (like setting up DNS, buying a domain, or writing the damn copy), I count down: **5-4-3-2-1** — then I start. No negotiation. No overthinking. Just go. My brain’s wired to pick the easy task, always. But the real progress? It comes from doing the hard stuff. That’s where the time goes, and that’s what actually moves things forward.
* 2. 2-Minute Rule: If a task takes less than 2 minutes (checking an email, pushing code, opening the design file), I do it right away. Small wins stack up fast.
* 3. Time Blocking + Micro-deadlines: I don’t wait for inspiration. I block time, just 30 mins - and I make the task small. Not “build landing page”, but “write 1 intro sentence in 15 mins.” Urgency is born from limits.

This project started as a weekend experiment. Now I use it daily. And honestly, it changed how I approach building anything.

I feel stronger now. Because I finished something real. I picked the hard task. I showed up. I created.

If you're stuck in the loop like I was, half-working, half-consuming, maybe it’s time.  
Pick your idea. Launch something weird.  
Finish something small. Even ugly. Even imperfect.

Because the day you hit ""publish"" on something real, even a tiny SaaS, is the day you stop being a wantrepreneur.

# And start becoming a builder. I built this with late nights, coffee, and a lot of unknowns, but I know one thing for sure: community is the best growth hack.

I’m offering 70% off (just $3/month) this week for early Pro users - only 20 slots available. I’d really love honest feedback and a few references to help shape the future of this tool.

If it doesn’t help you save time or make your YouTube learning easier, you can cancel anytime, no hard feelings.

Fair enough?

If you're curious to try it, DM me. I’ll personally onboard you.

Now I’m curious:

**Chapter 1 I'm Not My Boyfriend's Bride-to-be**



""I'll marry you, Mr. Foster.""  
  
Yvonne Scott made this call after downing half a bottle of wine.  
  
There was silence on the other end of the line before a deep, annoyed voice, rough from sleep, finally replied.  
  
""Do you realize what time it is?""  
  
Yvonne hadn't paid attention and quickly checked her phone—it was already 2:00 a.m.  
  
""Sorry about that. I'll call back tomorrow.""  
  
""Alright. My wife-to-be""  
  
""Huh?""  
  
""By the way, I'm heading overseas for a business trip tomorrow. I'll be away for about a month. Once I'm back, we can register for marriage.""  
  
""Okay.""  
  
After ending the call, Yvonne felt a little lightheaded.  
  
A couple of weeks earlier, her aunt from the countryside gave her a call, eager to introduce her to a potential boyfriend, Hendrix Foster.   
  
He was the grandson of their neighbor, Laurel Reed.  
  
He had been an outstanding student since childhood. After graduating from a university in Northville, he landed a high-paying job with an excellent work-life balance and ample growth opportunities.  
  
Although Yvonne had agreed verbally at that time, she didn't take it seriously and only intended to go along with the suggestion out of politeness. However, that very evening, Hendrix contacted her. He bluntly stated that he wasn't interested in blind dates or dating and proposed skipping straight to marriage if she was willing.  
  
""Is he crazy?""  
  
That was her only thought at that time.  
  
Before she could respond, he told her to think it over and abruptly ended the call.  
  
In truth, Yvonne hadn't given it any thought over the past two weeks. But tonight, she decided to say yes.  
  
Meanwhile, the internet was abuzz with trending news.  
  
The famous actress, Eliana Watson, was rumored to be pregnant, with speculation that the father was a married Best Actor.  
  
Shortly after Eliana was labeled a 'mistress' and became a trending topic, the second heir of the Jackmans, Zaid,  stepped forward to clarify. He announced that Eliana was his only and one girlfriend, and the baby she was carrying was his. They were planning to get married soon.  
  
Facing skepticism from many netizens, he released a video as proof. The footage at Eliana's recent birthday party showed him kneeling to propose.  
  
This revelation flipped public opinion. Fans and netizens alike began to offer their blessings.  
  
The top trending topic was ""Zaid Jackman and Eliana Watson are gonna get married"".  
  
Yvonne glanced at it and felt a pang of irony.  
  
*If Eliana is his only and one girlfriend, then what about me?*  
  
*What about the eight years I have spent by his side?*  
  
Realizing her foolishness, Yvonne decided it was time to stop it.  
  
Her decision to marry Hendrix had stemmed from his simple but heartfelt words.  
  
""I want to live an ordinary life with my wife—supporting each other, respecting one another, and growing old together.""  
  
It was her desired life, but Zaid had never been willing to give it to her.  
  
With her thoughts sorted, Yvonne began packing her belongings.  
  
The villa belonged to Zaid, so she needed to move out quickly.  
  
Since Yvonne had to work an early shift, she only managed to get a couple of hours of sleep before waking up.  
  
When she went downstairs, she noticed Zaid sprawled on the couch, his hair a mess and his face tense. It was clear he'd had too much to drink last night and was still feeling the effects.  
  
Choosing to ignore him, she headed into the kitchen to prepare breakfast.  
  
While she was cooking pasta, Zaid stumbled in, reeking of alcohol. He hugged her from behind, resting his chin on her shoulder.  
  
""Ugh, my head is killing me. Make me a cup of coffee,"" he mumbled.  
  
Yvonne went into the kitchen, pulled a can from the top shelf of the cabinet, and inside was his favorite coffee beans. He only drank freshly ground coffee, so whenever he wanted some, she would grind the beans and brew it slowly.  
  
Once it was done, she added milk, and while she was pouring the latte art, she couldn't help but laugh at herself. She'd been making coffee for eight years—enough to warm his stomach, but not his heart. As she finished a heart shape, she couldn't resist drawing a long line through the center of it.  
  
When Zaid came out of the shower, Yvonne placed the coffee in front of him. He quietly picked it up, seemingly not planning to explain what had happened last night. When he noticed the long line in the heart, that was when Yvonne broke the silence.  
  
""Congratulations.""  
  
Zaid glanced up, his handsome face showing a hint of confusion. ""What for?""  
  
She answered calmly, ""For proposing to Eliana on her birthday again and finally getting a yes after all these years.""  
  
She had always known about Zaid's feelings for Eliana. His love had spanned 15 years, beginning when they were in junior high.  
  
Every year on Eliana's birthday, he proposed to her. Even during the eight years he had been with Yvonne, that pattern hadn't changed.  
  
Yvonne had cared deeply, of course. But her love for Zaid had been so self-sacrificial that she endured it.  
  
Zaid's expression darkened. ""You've seen the news, haven't you?""  
  
Yvonne didn't respond, simply meeting his gaze.  
  
After a moment, he nodded and said nonchalantly, ""Eliana and I are only entering into a fake marriage. Once the media frenzy dies down, we'll get divorced.""  
  
""A fake marriage?"" Yvonne was momentarily speechless and smiled. ""Will there be a marriage certificate? A wedding?""  
  
""Obviously. Without them, neither of our families would agree to it.""  
  
""Then how is it a fake marriage?"" she questioned.  
  
""It'll be fake. There's no need for you to understand everything."" After sipping the coffee, Zaid stood and headed toward the stairs.  
  
Yvonne stopped him. ""I have no interest in interfering with your choices, but we need to settle things between us.""  
  
Zaid turned back, his tone impatient. ""What are you trying to say?""  
  
Taking a steadying breath, she replied, ""Let's break up.""  
  
""You still don't get it, do you? My marriage to Eliana is just for show. We'll get divorced soon enough. What's the big deal? It's none of your concern. You could just turn a blind eye! Are you trying to make yourself relevant?""  
  
*Make myself relevant? So funny.*  
  
Lowering her gaze, Yvonne spoke firmly, ""It doesn't matter if your marriage to Eliana is real or fake. I'm done with you. I want to end this.""  
  
""Yvonne!""  
  
""I'm exhausted,"" she said, closing her eyes. ""I've loved you for eight years, giving everything I had. I can't do this anymore. It's over.""  
  
""Fine, you want to break up? Don't come crying back later!""  
  
Zaid didn't bother going upstairs. He grabbed his coat and stormed out in anger.  
  
For Yvonne, that was the end of it. She felt surprisingly lighter, as though a weight had been lifted.  
  
She worked as a doctor in the obstetrics and gynecology department at Cloudstream Hospital. Arriving at the office early in the morning, she began receiving patients while overhearing gossip from the nurse, Molly Zinn.  
  
""Do you know whose baby Eliana is carrying? They said it was a married actor's before. Seems like it could be Andrew's, but Zaid claimed it was his last night. Such drama. Honestly, if it were me, I'd pick Zaid. He's not just wealthy, but also incredibly handsome. I heard Zaid is very faithful. He's been in love with her for 15 years! Who wouldn't be impressed by his dedication?""  
  
Yvonne wasn't interested in the gossip and promptly asked Molly to take a pregnant patient upstairs for an examination.  
  
However, her brief moment of quiet didn't last long. Zaid called her again.  
  
""Eliana will be coming to your hospital for a prenatal check-up tomorrow. Be ready to take care of her.""  



**Chapter 2 He's Faithful, but I'm His Backup**



Yvonne's patience snapped. ""There are plenty of hospitals in Cloudville. Why did you have to come here? And why involve me?""  
  
Despite her protest, Eliana still arrived early the next morning.  
  
As soon as she stepped out of the car, she was swarmed by obsessive fans and paparazzi. With security arranged in advance and Zaid's protection, she managed to make it into the hospital.  
  
Yvonne had already handed the case to another obstetrician, but Eliana insisted they were friends. That led Glen Baxter, the hospital director, to instruct Yvonne to take over.  
  
The prenatal tests were completed quickly, and Yvonne reviewed the report. Everything appeared normal.  
  
""The pregnancy is estimated to be ten weeks and three days. Since this is your first check-up, you'll need to prepare a pregnancy test manual,"" Yvonne said, glancing away from the computer to look at Zaid. ""The instructions are posted on the wall behind you. Just follow them.""  
  
Zaid frowned, finding it bothersome. ""You handle it. I'll stay with Eliana.""  
  
Yvonne's tone turned firm. ""I'm sorry, but this manual must be processed by the patient or their family. As a doctor, it's not my responsibility.""  
  
""Yvonne, can't you see Eliana needs me right now? Couldn't you show some understanding?""  
  
""If every family member expected me to be understanding, I'd end up running errands all day,"" she replied flatly.  
  
Zaid frowned. ""You—""  
  
""Next!""  
  
He was about to argue, but Eliana intervened.  
  
""Yvonne, please don't be upset. I won't burden him.""  
  
Yvonne looked at Eliana. For 15 years, Eliana had maintained a close relationship with Zaid, just enough to feel his need, but never to the point of overstepping boundaries. Even though Zaid had once been Yvonne's boyfriend, Eliana had accepted his devotion while presenting herself as Yvonne's friend.  
  
""He's your fiancé,"" Yvonne said calmly. ""Isn't it normal to ask him for help? Why would I be upset?""  
  
""Is it because of me that you two argued?"" Eliana asked.  
  
""There was no argument. We've already broken up.""  
  
""Yvonne, you're misunderstanding Zaid. He was only trying to help me.""  
  
Raising her hand, Yvonne cut her off. ""You don't matter to me. You're not the reason we broke up. Don't think highly of yourself.""  
  
""Yvonne, how dare you treat Eliana like that? Apologize to her!"" Zaid yelled.  
  
Yvonne had tried to hold back, but she couldn't anymore.  
  
""Get lost!"" she snapped.  
  
Her harsh response led to a report being filed against her. Zaid made the complaint call right in front of her.  
  
After they left, Yvonne was summoned to Glen's office.  
  
""Do you know that our hospital is under Jackman Healthcare?"" Glen asked.  
  
Yvonne stayed silent, fully aware of it.  
  
""The two people you just received are Eliana, a famous actress, and Zaid, the second son of the Jackmans,"" Glen said, looking at her, hoping she'd realize the seriousness of her actions.  
  
""So what?"" Yvonne replied nonchalantly, hands in her pockets.  
  
Glen slammed the table in frustration. ""Yvonne, do you even want to keep your job here?""  
  
""If the issue is simply that I refused a difficult request from Mr. Zaid, making him unhappy and risking my job, then I think I need to file for labor arbitration,"" she answered.  
  
""You don't get it, do you? That's the second son of the Jackmans! You're just a doctor. Do you think you can afford to offend him?""  
  
""I still have patients to take care of. Unless you have more instructions, I'll get back to work,"" Yvonne responded, ready to leave.  
  
""Why are you so stubborn?"" Glen asked, blocking her exit. ""There's one more thing. Ms. Watson trusts you a lot, but she can't come to the hospital. From now on, you'll be her attending physician and provide home visits whenever necessary.""  
  
""I refuse!""  
  
""You don't have a choice!""  
  
Back in her office, Yvonne felt overwhelmed. She couldn't understand why Zaid treated her so badly.  
  
After loving him fully for eight years, was her devotion now the reason he was bullying her?  
  
""The manual is ready.""  
  
She hadn't expected Zaid and Eliana to show up, and their faces held no sign of guilt.  
  
Yvonne smiled bitterly and silently took the manual, entering the information into the computer.  
  
""The manual outlines what pregnant women need to be aware of. Please read it carefully. I'll mark the next check-up date in the manual—don't forget to come,"" she said, writing down the date.  
  
""We're both busy. I need you to remind me about the appointment. I'll bring her then,"" Zaid said.  
  
Yvonne paused for a moment, then replied, ""I'm probably busier than both of you. I don't have time to worry about your affairs.""  
  
""Eliana's affairs are my affairs, and mine are yours. Just remind me when the time comes. No need for nonsense.""  
  
Yvonne glanced at Zaid, filled with conflicting emotions, but they quickly faded. ""We've already broken up. I don't want to say more. You can keep complaining about me, but I treat all my patients the same, following the hospital's system.""  
  
Zaid pursed his lips, sensing a firm resolve in Yvonne.  
  
""I'll remember that,"" Eliana said and pulled Zaid's hand, offering a generous look. ""Thanks, Yvonne. I may trouble you later.""  
  
""It's no trouble. It's just part of the job.""  
  
""Then we won't keep you any longer.""  
  
""Goodbye.""  
  
As they were about to leave, a group of obsessive fans rushed in, their phones aimed at Eliana and Zaid.  
  
""Ms. Watson, are you and Mr. Andrew Lloyd just friends? How do you explain both of you coming and going from the hotel late at night?""  
  
""Mr. Jackman, did you truly propose to Ms. Watson? Or is this just for show?""  
  
""Are you truly a couple? Ms. Watson, didn't you clarify before that you and Mr. Jackman are only good friends?""  
  
The crowd pushed forward, shoving each other.  
  
Zaid immediately shielded Eliana, though he was still jostled.  
  
The security guards couldn't get through, so Yvonne quickly came around from behind the desk to help Zaid keep the crowd away.  
  
Seeing her approach, Zaid handed Eliana to Yvonne.  
  
""Take care of Eliana!""  
  
With that, he turned to the fans and paparazzi, yelling, ""Leave now!""  
  
But the crowd didn't listen, and they kept pushing closer to dig up the news.  
  
One person managed to get closer to Eliana, but others behind pushed them forward, causing a domino effect that ended with Eliana getting bumped.  
  
Yvonne swiftly stepped in front of her, but two people shoved her, sending her crashing into the edge of a table.  
  
""Ouch!""  
  
Already in pain, Yvonne barely recovered before Zaid, pulling Eliana with him, accidentally bumped her again, causing her to hit the table corner once more. She cried out in pain.  
  
At that moment, Zaid pulled Eliana into a hug and then kissed her.  



**Chapter 3 It Turns Out I'm Not Worthy**



In front of a crowd, with cameras flashing and live broadcasts streaming, thousands of people were watching.  
  
Zaid kissed Eliana softly. His affection was evident in the gentle kiss.  
  
Yvonne stood there like a backdrop, appearing redundant and laughable at that moment.  
  
""See that? Do you still have doubts?""  
  
Zaid was furious, pointing at the obsessive fans and paparazzi crammed into the office.  
  
""Want to know our love story? Fine, I'll tell you today!  
  
""I've been in love with Eliana since junior high. I confessed to her after graduating high school, and we've been together for eight years. During that time, I've loved no one but her, and I'll love her forever!  
  
""I'll give her a grand wedding. Only Eliana is worthy of my love—no one else can compare!""  
  
He passionately declared his feelings, and his words were witnessed by countless people online and offline.  
  
The sound of applause interrupted the moment, causing everyone to look toward the source.  
  
Yvonne, dressed in a white coat and with neatly cut short hair, radiated a simple yet graceful elegance.  
  
She smiled and clapped, encouraging the fans, paparazzi, and onlookers to join in.  
  
Zaid glanced at her, his eyes flashing with a brief sense of guilt.  
  
""Mr. Jackman's dedication is truly touching. I wish you both happiness,"" Yvonne said calmly.  
  
Zaid's expression instantly darkened.  
  
""Keep your blessings to yourself. We don't need them!""  
  
He then took Eliana's arm and stormed out.  
  
As they left, the obsessive fans and onlookers dispersed, and the office fell silent.  
  
Yvonne sat down, holding her side where she had just bumped into something, the pain from the bruise throbbing. She lifted her clothes to reveal two bruises there.  
  
Later that afternoon, just before leaving work, Yvonne's phone buzzed. She saw a new message from someone adding her on WhatsApp.  
  
""I'm Hendrix Foster.""  
  
*Hendrix?*  
  
Yvonne paused for a moment, trying to remember who Hendrix was.  
  
She realized she had only spoken to him twice, both times over the phone. Since they were engaged, she should have added him on WhatsApp, so she accepted his friend request.  
  
Once the request was accepted, she was left staring at a blank screen, unsure of what to say. After a moment of thinking, she decided to close the app and finish packing up for the day.  
  
Yvonne had worked the day shift and finished her rounds in the inpatient department. By the time she left the hospital, it was already dark. She was about to hail a taxi when a black Maybach pulled up in front of her.  
  
The window rolled down, and Xavier Lambert waved with a smile. ""Yvonne, Sean's bar is opening today. He specifically asked me to pick you up after work to celebrate.""  
  
Xavier stressed the word 'specifically' and chuckled.  
  
Xavier and Sean Howard were Zaid's childhood friends, and Yvonne was also friendly with them, so she agreed to join them for the celebration.  
  
Inside the car, Xavier handed her a bottle of water.  
  
""I was there for Eliana's birthday too,"" Xavier said, sounding a little guilty.  
  
Yvonne twisted off the cap and took a few sips of water. She had seen the video of Eliana's birthday celebration. When Zaid knelt to propose, Xavier loudly cheered, ""Marry him! Marry him!""  
  
""I thought I was just a regular part of Eliana's birthday celebration. I didn't take it seriously, and I don't think Zaid did either. Who would've thought Eliana would say yes? I'm sure she had her reasons, but it's a little unfair to you.""  
  
""Thanks for acknowledging the unfair part.""  
  
""Uh, Zaid only did it to help Eliana.""  
  
""If it's just as friends, and you had to choose between me and Eliana, who would you pick?""  
  
Without hesitation, Xavier responded, ""Of course, it's you!""  
  
Yvonne smiled. ""Even if you're lying, it still makes me feel better.""  
  
He shook his head. ""I'm not lying. Even though I've known Eliana longer, I prefer being friends with you.""  
  
""That's why you came to pick me up today, and I got in your car. But let's not bring up Zaid again. We're done.""  
  
Xavier stuck out his tongue. ""People say things in the heat of the moment. What you said doesn't count.""  
  
Yvonne frowned. Did he think she was just upset and didn't truly want to break up with Zaid?  
  
Sean's new bar was tucked away at the back of an alley in a courtyard. The walls had theatrical decorations, and there was a small pond in the middle. Lamps hung along the corridor, giving the place a quiet, atmospheric vibe.  
  
Xavier pointed to the room at the far end and then left for the restroom.  
  
As Yvonne approached the door and was about to open it, she heard Zaid's voice, full of anger.  
  
""Sean, you're so annoying! She's the one who caused the breakup, not me!""  
  
Sean sighed. ""But it's your fault after all.""  
  
""Eliana needs my help.""  
  
""But what about Yvonne—""  
  
""Yvonne doesn't matter compared to Eliana!""  
  
""You'll regret it!""  
  
""No, she's the one who'll regret it! Every time Eliana needs me, Yvonne threatens to break up. But in the end, she's the one who asks for forgiveness. This time won't be any different. I'll just leave her hanging.""  
  
""Enough. You're acting without thinking just because you know Yvonne loves you. But love doesn't last forever. I've got a bouquet of roses for you. Use it to apologize to Yvonne later.""  
  
Upon hearing that, Yvonne took a deep breath and opened the door.  
  
Sean quickly stood up, smiling. ""Yvonne, I'm so glad you came.""  
  
Knowing that his bar was about to open, she had already brought a gift.  
  
""Congratulations on the opening,"" she said, handing it to him.  
  
Sean took it with a smile. ""Thank you.""  
  
He signaled to Zaid and then turned to Yvonne. ""Have a seat. I'll go greet the other guests.""  
  
""No, thanks,"" Yvonne replied, following him outside. ""I'll come back to support you another day.""  
  
""Yvonne ... ""  
  
""Thanks for the invite,"" she said, smiling politely at Sean before turning to leave.  
  
Just as she reached the door, Zaid rushed after her. ""Yvonne, are you mad?""  
  
Yvonne ignored him and kept walking out.  
  
""I've explained everything! Don't push me too far!""  
  
Zaid blocked her way, looking impatient.  
  
Yvonne stared at him and sneered. ""I heard what you said in the room. I used to lower myself, thinking I was worthy of you. I was wrong. These eight years have been my punishment for my mistakes, but I won't make the same mistake again.""  
  
She tried to leave, but Zaid grabbed her wrist, his gaze intense.  
  
""Do you have to act like this?""  
  
""Let go of me!""  
  
Zaid tightened his grip, his eyes filled with anger. But then, he suddenly pulled her toward the car.  
  
""Zaid, I'm not getting in your car!""  
  
""Let's go home first!""  
  
""I won't!""  
  
""It looks like I've neglected you lately. You're even willing to break up with me! I'll make it up to you tonight. You won't be leaving the bed for the next two days!""

**Chapter 4 I Don't Love You Anymore**



Yvonne tried to pull Zaid's hand off, but he held her tightly from behind.  
  
She attempted to bite him, but he pinched her chin.  
  
Then, he shoved her into the car and told the driver to start driving.  
  
Levi, Zaid's driver who also knew Yvonne, glanced back and sensed the tension in the air.  
  
""Levi, he's crazy! Let me out!"" Yvonne begged.  
  
""Mr. Zaid, Ms. Scott is—""  
  
""Who are you listening to? Who pays your salary?"" Zaid snapped.  
  
Levi, sensing they were just having an argument and not wanting to get involved, quickly drove off.  
  
Yvonne couldn't break free, so she calmed herself down.  
  
""Zaid, I'm not arguing with you. We broke up already. There's no need to make things worse.""  
  
Zaid, filled with anger, scoffed. ""Break up? I don't agree!""  
  
""You're going to marry Eliana. Can't you just let me go?""  
  
""No!""  
  
""You—""  
  
Zaid tightened his grip around her and gritted his teeth. ""Remember when you wanted to have a baby with me? I'll make you pregnant tonight!""  
  
""You jerk!"" Yvonne yelled, turning around and slapping him. The car fell silent.  
  
Zaid stared at her in disbelief. ""How dare you hit me!""  
  
Tears burned in Yvonne's eyes, but she clenched her jaw to hold them back.  
  
He was the man she had loved for eight years, and now he could say such hurtful things to her, showing no respect.  
  
""Zaid, what do I mean to you? A maid, or some lowly hooker?""  
  
Zaid, furious from the slap, shot back, ""You know exactly who you are! Whether you're a maid or a hooker, it's your choice! You're the one who chased after me!""  
  
Yvonne stared at him for a long time before letting out a bitter smile.  
  
""You're right. I deserve it.""  
  
""You just want to marry me, don't you? Are you even worthy of that?""  
  
""I'm not.""  
  
""You ... I know you're jealous of Eliana. Can you even compare to her?""  
  
""I can't.""  
  
""You ... you..."" Zaid stammered, growing more agitated.  
  
Yvonne, growing calmer, watched as his frustration grew.  
  
""You let me sleep with you for free for eight years! Do you think any man will want you now?"" he shouted.  
  
""So in your eyes, am I already worthless?""  
  
Zaid clenched his jaw. ""Yes, you're nothing but trash!""  
  
Yvonne nodded.  
  
At that moment, she felt completely clear-headed and thankful. She finally saw Zaid for who he truly was.  
  
Eight years wasn't short, but she still had many more years ahead of her.  
  
With that thought, Yvonne laughed.  
  
""What's so funny?"" Zaid growled.  
  
She looked at him with a smile. ""Zaid, from now on, I don't love you anymore.""  
  
Zaid went silent. Yvonne had threatened to leave him before, but she had never said she didn't love him anymore.  
  
""Levi, please pull over,"" Yvonne told the driver.  
  
Levi, who had stayed quiet, hesitated. ""Ms. Scott, we're still on the highway.""  
  
Yvonne didn't want to get off on the highway just to vent her anger. ""Then drop me off after the highway.""  
  
At that moment, Zaid's phone rang. His anger softened when he saw it was Eliana calling.  
  
Eliana explained she was on set, but paparazzi had surrounded the area. She needed him to pick her up.  
  
""Alright, I'll be right there!"" Zaid said, hanging up. He told Levi to head toward Northville at the next intersection.  
  
Yvonne frowned. Her house was in Southville District.  
  
""Levi, please pull off the highway and drop me off,"" she said.  
  
""Stop the car and let her out,"" Zaid ordered, his patience thinning.  
  
Levi hesitated. ""But this is the highway—""  
  
""I said stop the car!"" Zaid barked.  
  
Levi had no choice but to stop the car in the emergency lane.  
  
Zaid pushed Yvonne out of the vehicle. As she regained her balance, she realized her bag was still inside.  
  
She turned to see the car speeding away, disappearing into the distance.  
  
The highway was crowded with cars due to rush hour. Yvonne started walking along the side of the road toward the nearest exit, surrounded by honking horns and drivers yelling at her from their windows.  
  
After over an hour of walking, she finally reached the end of the highway. But with no phone or money, she had no choice but to continue walking home.  
  
The cold night wind made her shiver as she wrapped herself tightly in her clothes.  
  
With fewer cars on the road, she reached a corner, where a drunk man tried to grab her. She clenched her teeth and sprinted as quickly as she could, only to stumble and scrape her knee.  
  
Despite the pain, she couldn't stop and limped away until she managed to shake the drunk man off.  
  
Her villa was on the outskirts of the city. When she reached it, the sun was already beginning to rise.  
  
The soft glow of light coming from the house made her pause before knocking on the door.  
  
Eliana was the one who answered the door. Her hair was messy, and she was wearing a low-cut nightgown.  
  
When she saw Yvonne standing there, she exclaimed, ""Why are you back so late?""  
  
Yvonne frowned, confused as to why Eliana was at her house.  
  
""What are you doing here?"" she asked.  
  
Eliana blinked and replied, ""Zaid brought me here.""  
  
Yvonne walked past her and entered the house, only to bump into Zaid, who was coming out of the kitchen holding a steaming plate of pasta.  
  
She hadn't known he could cook.  
  
Once, when Yvonne was sick with a fever and sweating heavily, Zaid came home late from work, complaining that he was hungry and demanding she cook for him.  
  
Feeling helpless, she had said, ""If you don't like eating out, why not learn to cook? You can't starve when I'm not here, right?""  
  
He hugged her and stubbornly replied, ""I won't learn. I want you to cook for me forever.""  
  
Yvonne couldn't help but smile sadly at the memory.  
  
The truth was that Eliana was his true priority, and she was just someone to serve him. After all, he would never cook for a maid.  
  
Zaid shot her a cold look before leading Eliana to the living room. He placed the pasta on the table and then gave Eliana a cushion to lean against.  
  
""I'm not hungry."" Eliana pouted.  
  
""You need to eat. Breakfast is important,"" Zaid insisted, picking up the plate to feed her.  
  
Eliana reluctantly tried a bite, shook her head, and said, ""It's too salty.""  
  
""Really?"" Zaid tasted it, then nodded. ""It's indeed too salty. I'll make a fresh plate.""  
  
He didn't mind the extra effort and quickly went back to the kitchen to cook again.  
  
Yvonne was exhausted and just wanted to lie down for a nap.  
  
She made her way to the bedroom, only to find it in disarray—the bed was unmade, the pillow on the floor, and Eliana's clothes were hanging on the hanger while her clothes were carelessly tossed on a chair nearby.  
  
Suppressing her anger, Yvonne went downstairs and asked, ""Who slept in my room last night?""  
  
Zaid glanced at her and replied, ""From now on, Eliana will live here.""  
  
""This is my house. I didn't agree to that,"" she said sharply.  
  
He frowned. ""This is my house, not yours. My decision is what matters.""  
  
Yvonne's expression stiffened.  
  
Zaid was right. The house did belong to him.  
  
After university, she rented a place, but Zaid thought it was too small, so he asked her to move in with him.  
  
Even though she didn't pay rent regularly, she covered all the other household expenses. She didn't owe him anything.  
  
Eliana smiled and said, ""Zaid and I are planning to renovate this place into a new home. We can set up a room for you.""  
  
""No need!"" Yvonne snapped.  
  
She immediately went upstairs, grabbed a suitcase, packed her things, and came downstairs, ready to leave.  
  
""Yvonne, I don't have the patience to let you make a scene. If you leave with your luggage, we're done for good. There's no coming back,"" Zaid said through gritted teeth.  
  
Yvonne was already standing by the door. At his words, she turned around, looked him straight in the eye, and placed the keys on the shoe cabinet.  
  
""Let's end things on good terms,"" she said.

I really value the ease of use, ease of cleaning, durability, quality of coffee and would like to spend <$3000 if possible. I’ll splash on the Z10 if it’s REALLY that different but hoping for some opinions. Have also looked at the Phillips LatteGo 4/5000 series and Delonghi Eletta.

This started slow and progressed over time. I began with 30 min whole body workouts 3x a week and now I lift 4 days a week and do LISS/run on the treadmill the other 3. 

Diet is NOTHING special. I don’t like feeling hungry and I don’t like depriving myself of the things I love. I literally have 1-2 handfuls of semi sweet chocolate chips a day. The biggest thing that matters is making your meals heavy protein focused and hitting that goal and typically the rest will follow. Swapping out favs with healthier alternative-I enjoyed high sugar baked goods with my coffee each morning and those got swapped with high protein muffins, for example. I’ve cut down significantly on alcohol consumption as well. Maybe one drink every two weeks now. It’s loaded with sugar, calories, and hinders muscle growth. Get rid of it. 

My point is, is this process doesn’t have to be miserable. If you don’t enjoy it, you won’t continue, and consistency is the goal.

Hello, as an introduction I have transcribed an Instagram reel below to sums up how I feel.

""Sorry if I love you too much or seem too obsessed. I'm just trying to give you the love I never got.  If I come on too strong or seem overwhelming,  it's not because I want to suffocate you. It's because I want to make sure you know how special you are to me. I don't want to repeat the mistakes I experienced, and sometimes I struggle to find balance. I just want to give you everything I wish I had. I love that's unconditional, strong, and always present. So if I ever seem too much, it's only because I'm trying to fill the voids in both our hearts with something real. I hope you can understand. I know I may not be perfect, but my heart is genuine,and all I want is to make you feel cherished in ways I never knew. If I come on strong, it's because I believe you deserve the kind of love that goes beyond limits"".

""Never break up when you start losing feelings because that's when real love starts. You can't just give up on someone because the situation is not ideal. Great relationships are not great because they have no problems. They're great because both people care enough about the other person to find a way to make it work. So when you're in a serious relationship, you'll have your ups and downs. But talking things over is a better solution than throwing it all away. Because the couples that are meant to be are the ones who go through everything that is meant to tear them apart and come out even stronger"".



About me

- Height: 6'0

- Alcohol: Very rarely as in once in a few months and I have never gotten drunk as the moment I feel dizzy, I counteract the effects with apple juice.

- Hair colour: Black

- Skin colour: naturally tanned skin

- Most people describe me as cute

- Always clean shaven

- I have no siblings 

- No tattoos or piercings

- Weight: varies between 70kg (150lb) to 75kg (165lb) depending on how much I eat and active I am. 

- Work out and eat healthy although from time to time, indulge myself with a pie, ice cream ot donut. 

- Finances: I manually keep track of my finances as I enjoy using cash wherever it is accepted. I like to physically feel money.

- Child-free life: never had an interest in having kids. I still remember my age when I made this life long decision, I was 17 at the time.

- Independence: I live alone in a foreign country (this is the second coubtry I am working temporarily with no family. Over the years I have learned to cry alone as I had no one to call and had to force myself to recover from severe depression. Including one very painful break up. I have also learned to take care of myself when I had accidents.

- Anger: I cannot get angry. If I do, I suffer with a headache and overtime my body has learned to associate anger with pain, so instead of gettin[?p0g angry, I get frustrated. To cope with my frustration, I go for a walk, look at the stars or something in the distant like a mountain, cityscape or the Ocean. Taking deep breaths also helps.

When I love someone, I put my partner first where I work out and try to be the best version of myself for my partner. This also goes for the way I dress to everything. 

Exploration of new interest: I take an interest in my partners hobbies, movies, music, food and  what she likes in order to deepen the connection and bond. 

Strong desire to be honest: when I am with a partner I have a strong desire to be transparent and I just feel comfortable being able to speak without thinking twice. 

Social isolation: I only feel a real social connection with a partner. I often feel lonely or withdrawn in social activities as I know that a partner is for life while other people are only their for the moment.

Panic mode: if my partner gets mad at me and starts scolding me I go into a panic mode where I become nervous, scared and my breathing becomes heavy. 

This is because my self-worth and validation becomes dependent on my partner and I am afraid to dissapoint her.


What do I expect from a partner?

Someone who cares in the sense will give me a hug or hold my hand when I need it the most and will be honest with me.

A partner who wants to create memories together, it could be something simple as watching the sunset and just eating a mal together.

I am mentally unable to feel attracted to more than one person due to Limerence which makes me extremely loyal and committed to one person.

Just knowing that I am special to my partner is enough to make happy.



Love Language: The way I express love towards a partner is through;

- Quality time where I give my partner her undivided attention, making memories together, shared activities and doing things together.

Acts of service: I believe that actions speak lounder than words and I have always dreamed of being the one who;
- does all the house chores so that you can relax
- cooking for you
- running an errand
- being helpful in anyway I can
- hold an umbrella over your head
- carry your bag
- serve you tea, juice coffee or anything you ask


Physical touch: Never experienced this. 
- Hug: Never been hugged by a women, but I long for it so much and would love to have a partner I can hug back.
- Kiss: I have kissed one person I love once loved on the cheek but never gotten a kiss back.
- Holding hands: never held hands, but want to
- Cuddling: Never experienced it, but I guess it must be nice.

Words of Affirmation: expressing affection through spoken or written words, such as compliments, encouragement, and expressions of love (""I love you"").

Photography: Photography is the best way to create a memory I would love to take photographs together and put them in physical photo album. 

Why am I still single? I have something called Limerence which is an obsessive romantic attraction to another person, which only happens if I genuinely 

Past relationships: One and it was a very toxic relationship where I was treated more like a Dog than a partner which ended in May, 2024. Due to Limerence which I didn't know I had at the time, I was unable to just break away from the toxic relationship. 


Things that I don't care about in a partner;

- Hair Color 
- Attitude 
- Career
- Height 
- Tattoos or birth marks you have
- Piercings 
- Race
- Religion 
- Your past
- Cooking: I can cook for you if you don't know how how to cook.
- Alcohol: get drunk if you want to, but if you start acting crazy I will just take you home.


Preferred Partner 

Skin colour: White or Tan

Age range: 24 to 34 

Someone who cares about her long term health. I mean as the saying goes ""health is wealth"".

Values Loyalty and will be transparent and honest with me just as I will be honest and transparent with you.

No smoking or Vaping. I hate the smell of nicotine and the the smoke released from exhaling vapes. Also, I saw my Grandpa suffer in hospital and die as result of a lifetime of smoking.

My interest 

- 35mm Film Photography: Imagine processing film together. 

- Analogue Navigation: Yes, even in 2025 I use a Lensatic compass and map for navigation outside the city, where often times, this ancient technology had proven itself to be more reliable and accurate compared to Google maps.  Believe me, if you get lost in a forest, desert or in the Ocean I am the guy you need by your side.

- Journaling: Lamy Safari,  Parker Jotter or Stencil Pencil 

- Typewriter: I own a Typewriter in my home country and love typing notes or documents on it. It is especially useful for typing out shopping list. 

- Old off-road vehicles: I prefer older vehicles from the 1970's and 80's due to the durability, reliability and such as the Toyota Hilux, Toyota Land Cruiser or a 1970's Land Rover Defender. Personally, due to my job I travel in Bentley, BMW's, Cadillac's, Lamborghini's, Nissan's, Toyota's, Mercedes. 

Watching birds and other animals through my binoculars or photographing them using my 200-500mm lens.


Send me a message and lets get to know each other better.  

Also, it would be lovely if we could call each other, as I feel it's easier to build a stronger connection.

It was cold out. Coffee in one hand, coat half-zipped, standing in front of my perfume shelf like it owed me answers. I didn’t want “fresh.” I didn’t want “powdery.” I just wanted something to make me feel… **beautiful again**.

Enter:[ Amber Oud Ruby Edition by Haramain.](https://alharamainperfume.online/products/haramain-amber-oud-ruby-edition-spray-100ml?variant=43854650474553)

I’d picked it up on a whim. People said it was a *dupe* of Baccarat Rouge 540—but I wasn’t chasing clones. I just wanted *comfort*. And this scent? It gave me more than that. It gave me **magic**.

https://preview.redd.it/4mukhjwc0k0f1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=24b252676eaa96c5082d0b114884057581af52cf

  


# First Spray – Warmth, Red Velvet & Confidence

That opening? Saffron and almond, soft and sweet—like roasted almonds swimming in warm brown sugar, with threads of red spice flickering through. No harsh alcohol. No loud “LOOK AT ME” entrance. Just… velvet.

It felt like red lipstick on a lazy day. A quiet flex. That was the moment I whispered to myself, “This one’s different.”

  


# The Middle – Jasmine, Woods, and Air That Shimmers

As it settled, it got even better. **Jasmine shows up**, not old-fashioned or powdery, but soft, silky, blending with smooth woods and amber. There’s this glowing elegance—it doesn’t *project*, it *glows*.

Sometimes I’d catch it in the breeze—not in a cloud-choking way, but like the air shimmered around me. Like the way the world feels just before a kiss, when everything pauses.

That’s what this scent does. **It waits until you forget it’s there—then reminds you, softly.**

  


# How It Makes Me Feel – My Ruby Armor

I wear it when I want to feel **powerful in a gentle way**. When I’m tired, anxious, lost—it’s my reset button.

It’s the friend that doesn’t give advice but pours you a glass of wine and says, “Take your time. I’m here.”  
It’s **sweet, but grounded**. Warm like a cashmere blanket. Comforting, but never sleepy. Confident, but never loud.

Even when I’m not my best self, this scent reminds me I’m still *me*.

# Colors, Vibes, and Textures

If this scent were a painting, it’d be:

* Deep **ruby red**
* Glowing **antique gold**
* Silky **ivory neutrals**

It smells like softness with depth. Romance with roots. Like saffron spun into silk. And somehow? It feels both **feminine and fluid**. It’s not bound by gender or season—it just adapts to *you*.

  


# Compliment Magnet (Without Even Trying)

I didn’t buy it for compliments—but they come:

* “You smell like a warm dessert.”
* “What is that? It’s amazing.”
* “You smell expensive.”

But the best part? **People aren’t just reacting to the scent—they’re reacting to how it feels on you.**





# My Little Ritual

Now, whenever I spray it, I breathe deeper. Stand taller. Even if I’m just staying in. It’s not about being seen—it’s about *feeling seen*. And on the days I need that? [Amber Oud Ruby](https://alharamainperfume.online/products/haramain-amber-oud-ruby-edition-spray-100ml?variant=43854650474553) **is my armor. My hug. My glow.**

Didn’t expect to fall in love with this one.

But I did. And I’m still falling.





**What’s the scent that brought you** ***back*** **to perfume?** The one that whispered instead of shouted—but changed everything?

Let’s talk about those. ❤️

1kov12j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Songwriting/comments/1kov12j/in_response_to_how_do_you_decide_thinking_about/,"In response to ""How do you decide."" Thinking about metaphor vs concrete images in verse","Hey all! I tried to post this in response to the thread: ""How do you decide."" In that post, OP wondered how people make decisions about when to write concrete, direct lyrics, vs when to be vague or abstract. For some reason, Reddit wouldn't let me comment with the following post,  but I wanted to share it because it took a bit of time to write. I'd love to know ways other redditors on this thread think about concrete imagery in songwriting!

**The post:**

There are so, so many ways to think about concrete vs vague language, but the answer is that it ultimately boils down to everybody's individual practice and taste. I think about metaphor in a couple different ways:

**As a haymaker:**

In songs that are a bit slower, where the audience has more time to linger on lyrics, I think of lines as ""jabs"" or ""haymakers."" Jabs are lines that either set the scene, establish the larger metaphorical conceit, or cue the listener into a larger cultural context. Haymakers are the lines that hit the audience with the emotional line.

Sometimes jabs and haymakers are concrete. Here's a segment from Elephant by Jason Isbell:

She says, ""Andy You crack me Up."" (jab)  
Seagrams in a coffee cup (jab)  
Sharecropper eyes and hair almost all gone (haymaker)  
When she was drunk she made cancer jokes (jab)  
Made up her own doctor's notes (jab)  
Surrounded by family who saw she was dying alone (haymaker.)

Sometimes the metaphors are used to reinforce lines where the songwriter tells rather than shows. Here's a verse from Charlene by Anthony Hamilton:

She knows I really love this old music thang (jab)  
Since I was a child it's been my dream (jab)  
I can support her, treat her and spoil her (jab)  
You know, buy her the finer things (jab)  
But I forgot about loving her (haymaker)  
Damn the money, diamonds and pearls (haymaker, a concrete line, but a metaphor)  
What about the hard day she had with the baby (haymaker)  
All she need is for me to love her (haymaker)

Sometimes, Haymakers function off of larger cultural context. Here's a segment from Samson by Regina Spektor:

Samson came to my bed (jab)  
Told me that my hair was red (jab, reminds us of the metaphorical conceit of Samson's hair.)  
Told me I was beautiful (jab)  
And came into my bed (jab)  
Oh, I cut his hair myself one night (haymaker, drawing from cultural context)  
A pair of dull scissors in the yellow light (jab)  
And he told me that I'd done alright (jab)  
And kissed me 'til the mornin' light, the mornin' light (haymaker)

**Zooming in and out:**

Sometimes, concrete language is used to guide the listener's eye before they find out the larger metahporical context. This can be done in a couple different ways, in ""scene"" or ""summary."" Scenes are moments that we are living in real time with the character. Summary is a long arc that's told as a montage.

Here's how Gillian Welch uses images in summary to tell the story of what could be weeks or months (in just two lines!), from Miss Ohio:

Had your arm around her shoulder, a regimental soldier  
An' mamma starts pushing that wedding gown  
Yeah, you wanna do right but not right now

Kendrick Lamar is a master of drawing you deep into a scene and letting you understand the stakes while drawing some really crazy metaphors. Here's a moment in scene from ""Art of Peer Pressure.""

Me and my \*\*\*\* four deep in a white Toyota  
A quarter tank of gas, one pistol, an orange soda  
Janky stash box when the federales'll roll up  
Basketball shorts with the Gonzales Park odor  
We on the mission for bad \*\*\*\* and trouble  
I hope the universe love you today  
'Cause the energy we bringin' sure to carry away  
A flock of positive activists that fill they body with hate

**Conclusion:**

The way you decide on how to use clear, concrete language or metaphor is ultimately up to you. An important exercise, though, is to consider how you think about the use of these tools and then use that language you develop for yourself to analyze songs you love. Open mics are also a great time to practice this--listen to everyone's lyrics, how they construct a line. See what lyrics grab you from each person's performance and compliment them on them. This active listening will pay dividends in your own writing and make you some homies who will also engage with your craft.",5,1747494075.0,Songwriting,3,1.0,False

We bought a Linea Mini for our office a couple years ago. We only had 15 people at the time, but it has become quite popular and we've got a lot of coffee aficionados. Now that we're 30+ employees, there is often a queue in the morning of people waiting to make their espresso drinks.

I'm considering a couple options to increase throughput, one being upgrading to a GB5 with 3 group heads.

Do you think 2 people can comfortably operate a 3 group head machine simultaneously? (Leaving the 3rd middle group head open). They still need to grind their beans and weigh out their shots, but that process is faster and can be solved with a more reliable grinder as well.

The alternative is to get a 2nd Linea Mini, but that is a bit of a hassle to service 2 machines and run water + drain lines to each.

Curious what y'all think is the best way to improve throughput for individuals all pulling their own shots.

I know in a retail coffee shop this might work different, but for this scenario, everyone is their own barista.

  
EDIT: I'm also interested in the built in scale feature of the GB5 so that after tamping and locking in the group head, each person can just push one button and have the machine pour out the exact dosage and shut off automatically, allowing the person to get started on milk without worrying about turning the machine off at the right time.",1,1747493898.0,LaMarzocco,2,1.0,False

I had a really good friend but we lost contact two years ago BCS she had a psychosis. I didn't know about her and wanted help for her but rejected me and cut al contact. A few months ago she reached out to me so we met with a coffee. She tolded me she had psychosis and was forced into a closed ward. She has a psychiatrist now and people who come visit once a week to check on her.
So she finally took baby steps to help and I'm so proud and support her.
The last week's she was really bad and depressed. She ghosted the psychiatrist and mobile team and I was really worried to. I was the only one that could talk to her and was very scared to lose contact again.
She changed really fast on mood, sometimes she was really against help and hated everyone and was gonna hurt animals, five seconds later she was really fragile and needed comfort. I washed her in the bath like a little child cuz she was so miserable.
She reached her peak, but now she is better. Still fragile, but not psychotic I guess. I told what happened and she doesn't remember some events.
I really want to help her, but she doesn't trust the healthcare system enough when she is in crisis. I really want to take care of her, but it sometimes I need to set my boundaries BCS I'm also working on myself.
I want to prevent she gets admitted again against her will. On that ward are other patients that will not have a good influence on her. I live in Belgium and we have EPSI. It's a voluntarily ward. I have been there admitted to and think it's the best place for her. There's almost no contact with other patients, not therapy, just rest. I think it will help her and I don't need to be worried constant about her.
Any tips in how to support her and trust the professionals?
She deserves the help, but I understand she is afraid of healthcare BCS she only has experience with forced therapy and everything.

Also any movies lecture about psychosis, BCS I wanna understand what's happening in her head.

I really want to support her, but I need to respect my boundaries. But im afraid if I throw her in a hospital and be like just listen to the doctor, she will lose her the tiny trust en progress she had and will be worse.",2,1747493846.0,Psychosis,0,1.0,False

I just landed a full-time BDR role in tech sales at a top 3 international company in their respective field. 
30 days ago, I was managing a 150+ unit apartment complex. No SaaS background. No referrals. No sales title on my resume. Just years of conflict resolution, leasing, rent collection, and operational chaos.

Here’s how I made the pivot in 4 focused weeks:

1. I rebuilt my resume from scratch
	•	Stripped out industry jargon and wrote for outcomes: occupancy increases, revenue impact, negotiations
	•	Highlighted the sales in my day-to-day: lease-ups, upselling units, closing renewals, and handling objections
	•	Used clear metrics: X% occupancy increase, $X revenue handled, number of units, etc
	•	Tailored everything to sales language, not property management buzzwords

2. I studied the BDR/SDR game like my life depended on it
	•	Read job descriptions and took notes on patterns
	•	Learned the tech stack: Salesforce, Outreach, Gong, ZoomInfo, etc
	•	Practiced cold call frameworks, objection handling, discovery questions

3. I went all-in on LinkedIn
	•	Optimized my profile headline and About section to scream “ready-to-hire sales rep”
	•	Started connecting with SDRs, BDRs, AEs, and sales leaders
	•	Sent out 5-10 connection requests per day with short intros
	•	Logged every response, built a Google Sheet CRM of outreach

4. I built momentum fast
	•	First virtual coffee chat booked by week 2
	•	Mock cold calls by week 3
	•	Final round interview and offer in hand by week 4

Things I avoided:
	•	Applying blindly to 100+ jobs
	•	Generic cover letters
	•	Talking too much about property management instead of transferable skills

If you’re stuck in an industry that doesn’t scale, this pivot is real.
But you can’t just spray and pray with resumes—you need a strategy, execution, and urgency.

Ask me anything if you’re serious about making the switch. I’ll tell you what actually worked.

1kouxlp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1kouxlp/my_wife_locked_me_out_of_our_apt/,My wife locked me out of our apt.,"It's been mentioned in the comments that I should note that my wife was diagnosed bipolar ten years ago. It hasn't been an acute issue aside from events such as below. I had fallen into a cycle of forgive/forget during our entire relationship, but this year I made a decision to document these events and remember how they make me feel. 

Anyway. Story below.

I left early this morning to have her car inspected and bring us coffee. I brought us coffee and I brought her a chocolate croissant.

The croissant annoyed her because it was too hard. She told me that she had mentioned she had jaw pain earlier this week...the implication being that I should have known better?

She has admittedly has had a tough week. Problems with her mom, stress at work, stress with her activities. That's why I offered to help by taking her car to get inspected so she could sleep in today.

Anyway. I get home and she's enjoying her drink in bed while I stand near the entrance. I perch my coffee on a little entrance table we have while we talk about our plans for the day. At some point, I turn and my arm knocks over my coffee from the table onto the concrete floor.

What follows is a bit of blur. She offers to buy me a replacement, then starts helping me clean up, but grows more annoyed. She tells me to get away and just sit down because I'm making things worse. Okay, I do that and give her space.

After her cleaning and mopping for a while, she is very clearly agitated. She starts listing a bunch of grievances all at once. 

It all ends with one final bizarre question: ""did you remember to wear sunscreen this morning before you left?""

I told her no, I didn't wear sunscreen. It was early enough and I thought fast enough of an outing that I wouldn't mind it. She did not like that response. She told me I never listen to her, and that I should because she knows what she's talking about. I apologize and she tells me it's always the same thing with me. 

She then says that I left sticky coffee residue all over the apartment when I walked to the couch, and that my slippers are dirty.

At this point, she tells me to go get myself another coffee. She insists upon it, so I leave to do that. She calls me on the phone while I'm headed downstairs to tell me, ""I just wanted you to know I have to mop this entire apartment because you walked around in your dirty slippers"" and hangs up on me.

I turn around and take the elevator back upstairs so I could offer to help mop. As I walk towards the door, I hear her lock the deadbolt. I stood there for a moment a little flabbergasted because I knew that meant she was standing in from the peephole waiting for me to show up so she could lock the door. It was weird.

I tried unlocking the door with my key to confirm my suspicion that it was locked. I confirmed the door was locked, so I simply turned around and left for the coffee shop.

I'm writing all of this here from the coffee shop. 
While standing in line she left a missed call on my phone. I called her back to let her know I have my coffee, and asked if I can come home or if she still needs space. She said ""I don't know."" And hung up.

I've never been locked out of my home before. I've never even thought that could happen to me before. I don't know how to feel about this. Especially considering that it's over something so innocent as literally spilled coffee.

I (48F) work security at the main gate of a luxury community — the kind of place where residents argue about mailbox colors and golf cart etiquette. It’s my job to keep things secure and civil, which often means politely enforcing rules that people don’t *want* to hear. So I try to stay professional, firm, and friendly to both residents and contractors who come through to work on homes.

For context that might be relevant: I’m told I look younger than I am. I’m 5'9"", shoulder length platinum blonde with my gray blending in nicely (thank you genetics), freckles, and green eyes. Contractors don’t always know what to do with a tall-ish security lady who looks like she wandered out of a Viking cosplay.

I’m also **happily** married to my 30-year-old husband, who is my best friend, emotional support human, and protector of my peace. He used to work with me at the gate but now he’s a deputy sheriff, so he fully *gets* the weird dynamics that come with this job. We talk about everything and he’s aware of this situation.

Now. Enter... **Efraim. (name changed of course)**

Efraim is a contractor who started bringing me candy at the gate. Not unusual — contractors sometimes give snacks to guards as a thank-you. A biscuit here, a mini Snickers there. Usually it’s harmless. So at first I took the candy and was like, “Aww, thanks!” I even tried to say thank you in Spanish (badly — I’m learning, but we’re still at ‘Spanglish and Google Translate’ levels of fluency here).

Then it became... a pattern. Efraim brought candy the next day. And the next. I told my husband, who laughed and helped me eat it. But then Efraim gave me **a card with his phone number on it.**

At that point I pointed to my wedding ring — which I *always* wear — and told him (again, badly) that I’m married and not going to call him. He seemed to understand. I didn’t see him for a few weeks. Crisis over, right? Wrong.

One day he shows back up — *not even working that day* — just drops off candy and leaves. At this point I’m wondering if I’ve accidentally starred in a Hallmark movie against my will.

Then comes the kicker: he returns weeks later *while on the job* and gives me a **$25 Starbucks gift card.** I don’t even like Starbucks, y’all. (Seriously, someone trade me for independent coffee brewer or something.)

I looked confused and tried to hand it back, but there were cars lined up and he wouldn’t take it. So now I have this card burning a hole in my drawer and I feel... weird.

So here’s where I ask:  
**AITA for accepting these gifts?**  
I haven’t encouraged him. I’ve been polite but clear. I’ve never seen him outside of work. I don’t even know if he *understands* that I’m married — do wedding rings have different meanings across cultures? Is this just an overly generous Candy Man situation? Does he just have a *thing* for blondes with security clipboards?

Also, is it inappropriate for me to even *accept* this stuff, even though I didn’t ask for it and tried to give it back?

I’ve kept my husband in the loop the whole time, and he isn’t mad — just amused/confused — but I still feel like I’m walking a weird ethical line here.

I was interacting with parents and I talked to lil brotha, he misheard me, I said ""hapi ka *hisname*"" and he thought I said ""kape ka"" because I was holding a coffee when I asked him that, he said no, and our parents heard that, so they thought he wasn't happy with the current simple handa for bday, like he was expecting so much daw kahit hirap na sa money churva churva and he just took it there all misunderstood and sht. 

Usually humihiram ako damit ni papa kasi malalaki and oversized so I went into the room and yung cabinet nila is mixed and katabi lang ng kama ng kapatid ko cabinet nila, so I went in there to get clothes and I can hear him sobbing, like it's loud and silent at the same time, he is really really trying his best to not be heard balot sa unan and kumot and all and I can see his whole body stiffen up whenever he sniffs as an attempt to lessen the sound produced. It broke me, as a middle child it broke me to see him like that so I am planning to take him out on a gala, just me and him and siya ang in charge, but like my entire savings is 3k lang, since 1k is for travel expenses (plan ko is sa MOA because he never have been there and matagal na niya want) taga cav kami and I study in manila so I know the commute na.

Current plan:

Watch a minecraft movie with popcorn and potato corner, then eat jollibee (or wherever he wants) after the movie then uwi na

Previous Attempts: none yet, first gala with him

Dive into These 6 Features, Including Gemini AI, Before Everyone Else!","The excitement surrounding the upcoming WearOS 6 is palpable, and honestly, it feels like we've been waiting for a significant leap in smartwatch technology for a while now. With the introduction of features like Gemini AI, it seems like Google is finally stepping up its game to deliver an experience that could truly revolutionize how we interact with our wearables.

One of the standout features is the improved health tracking capabilities. Imagine having a smartwatch that not only tracks your steps but also offers personalized health insights based on your activity levels and habits. This could be a game-changer for fitness enthusiasts looking to optimize their routines or even for those just starting their wellness journey.

Another feature that’s caught my eye is the enhanced integration with smart home devices. Picture this: controlling your lights, thermostat, or even your coffee maker right from your wrist. It’s that level of convenience that makes smartwatches not just a luxury but a necessity in our daily lives.

And let’s not forget the revamped user interface! A more intuitive design can make all the difference in how quickly we access important information. It’s these little touches that make tech feel more personal and less like a chore.

As we gear up for the launch, I can't help but feel a mix of anticipation and curiosity. Will WearOS 6 truly live up to the hype, or will it be just another incremental update? Only time will tell, but I’m all in for the ride. What are you most excited about?",1,1747493138.0,hacksguider,0,1.0,False

1koulro,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1koulro,"Trip to Paris, Apr. 14 - 29","We had a wonderful time in Paris, and like so many others, I got so much information from this subreddit that I wanted to share some highlights & tips from our trip. Sorry this is so long - but hopefully it helps future travelers! The photos are stream of consciousness / what caught my eye in Paris.

**Musées**

We went to 10 museums in Paris; that was the focus of our trip. We really really like art from the impressionists & modernists and later.

We got a 4-day Paris Museum Pass and structured our day around that day’s museum. We went to the Louvre because we felt obligated to - but it wasn’t a huge hit, both because of the crowds and also because it wasn’t art that really spoke to us. That said, I really LOVED seeing Delacroix’ Liberty Leading the People. Its restoration is magnificent. If I were venture to the Louvre again, we’d get tickets for first thing in the morning.

The other PMP’s were: L’Orangerie — ah, those Monets!! We were there when the museum opened and it was a fabulous way to see the water lilies. Just spectacular. The Walter-Guillaume collection was lovely too. We walked across the Seine after that and made our way to Delacroix’ home — I loved seeing his studio.

We spent most of the next day at the Musée d’Orsay, starting right when it opened. WHOA, that was terrific. So many great paintings. We took a few breaks in that museum; we ate in the restaurant upstairs and didn’t have much of a line right after it opened.

The other two PMP museums were the Musée de l’art & histoire de judaïsme - the exhibit on Alfred Dreyfus was fascinating on so many levels. Since we were nearby, we then went to the Musée Picasso Paris — also stunning. The special exhibit was on “degenerate” art in Germany during Nazism.

I was so sad that most of the Pompidou collection was closed to us. We did go see the Suzanne Valadon exhibit, which was good (and crowded). We went to the Librarie (bookstore) afterwards, and I was reminded of all the art that I’d wanted to see in the Pompidou. But I know it needs updating, so we’ll have to go back when it’s reopened.

We also went to the David Hockney exhibit at the Fondation Louis Vuitton. It was absolutely stunning - and crowded (we reserved tickets for when the museum opened). I liked the earlier stuff better, perhaps because it had been more curated (his greatest hits, if you will), but the works he created on his iPad/iPhone were really creative and beautiful. 

Finally, we went to Montmartre, visiting both the Dalí museum and the Musée Montmartre, which is a lovely slice of history. We were able to see Valadon’s studio, which was a great complement to having seen her works at the Pompidou.

**Streets & Sights**

Beyond museums, we mostly just walked around. We‘d pick a neighborhood, either because of a museum or a shop or something else - and then either walk to or from that area (or both). We walked a TON and used 18 metro tickets in our 2 weeks.

**Restaurants & Coffee**

We love to eat and we had quite a few ""tradi"" baguettes while we were there. We were so unscheduled that we didn't make plans for a Michelin-starred restaurants, but here are the best that we did go to:

\- [Breizh Cafe](https://www.breizhcafe.com) in the 10th. Delicious savory (buckwheat) crepes and also sweet crepes for dessert.   
\- [Maria Belza](https://www.mariabelza.com) \- Basque food also in the 10th. Lovely service and good food.

– I'm really new to coffee, but [Terres De Café](https://www.terresdecafe.com/en/) was the absolute best coffee I've ever had. Spouse had a cappucino with Ethiopian beans, and I had a matcha latte, which was also the best matcha I've ever had.  
\- Back in the 10th, [Ten Belles](https://www.tenbelles.com) was my local favorite for a café crème.  

**Shopping**

I needed to buy a dress to wear to an evening wedding upon our return, so I was clothes shopping, also because: Paris. My two recommendations for middle-aged white lady clothes:

\- [Antoine & Lili](https://www.antoineetlili.com/fr/) \- I got a charming & warm black cardigan and a denim skirt that I'll wear forever.  
\- [Heroïnes](https://www.heroines.fr) \- I got a dress for the wedding AND some phenomenal electric blue strappy sandals.   
Both were in the 10th near where we stayed, but I believe both have locations throughout Paris.

**Hotel**

We wanted to stay in one place for the 2+ weeks (15 nights). Our goal: a decent room in an interesting and relatively inexpensive, non-touristy neighborhood with a microwave & fridge, which aren’t standard in European hotels. I didn’t mind if the room was small.

We found the perfect place in the [Staycity apart-hotel in the 10th arrondissement](https://www.staycity.com/paris/gare-de-lest), near the Gare de l’Est 9.5/10 – excellent. Great value, lovely staff, very well-stocked kitchenette, phenomenal location. The room was small, but on the 5th floor so we had lovely light. I’d absolutely stay there again. The staff were all super friendly and spoke to my husband in good English & tolerated my rusty French.

It was a 5-minute walk from the Canal Saint-Martin, near a lovely public garden (Jardin Villemin), and close to multiple Metro stops. Also terrific restaurants nearby, plus many grocery stores (a Franprix, Intermarché, Mono’ / Monprix).

If I were to do it again, I'd reserve the night before too, so we could check in right when we got to the hotel after our flight from the U.S.

**Navigation**

\- I used the Île-de-France Mobilités app for my metro tickets, and I used a combo of that and Google maps for navigation. Sometimes one was better than the other. I only got really messed up once and I was able to get out of it. I bought a 20 pack & ended up with 2 left.

\- Spouse preferred tangible Metro tickets, so I got him those and got myself via the Mobilités app. I much preferred the app version as it was super easy. One time, spouse got plastic cards: he purchased 10 trips & got 10 cards; the second time, he got paper tickets. idk why. But his way worked too.

**Overall**

We had a phenomenal time. The majority of folks we met were kind, tolerant of my rusty French, and spoke English. I'm pretty accustomed to cities; didn't encounter anything terribly unpleasant or strange.

I have the BBE and I am ready to upgrade on the grinder side of things; other than that the machine is amazing though. I am mostly making lattes and milk based drinks. Price is obviously a factor, given the products on the list, but the most important to me will be the user interface and the quality of the coffee it puts out (yes I use fresh beans). If I am missing something you think might fit on this list or there are other recs, I would love to hear! 

  
**Turin/Miicoffee DF54:** This seems to be the hot commodity right now, and its hard to argue with all of the positive reviews. My only turn-off is the negatives I have heard about retention/cleaning/clogging, but at this price point, I should keep up with cleaning anyway. My other concern (small) is that they don't seem to be shipping out for another few weeks, and I don't know how many more beans I am willing to waste on a crap grinder. 

  
**Varia VS3**: Also looks great, but some LOVE it and others HATE it.

  
**Barratza Encore ESP:** not much to say here, probably the most reviewed/recommended grinder, but is it more worth it to spend an extra $20-$50 for the DF54 or similar?

  
**Urbanic 070S**: Actually never even heard of this until I saw it in one of Lance's tier lists. Looks sweet and amazing price point, but that's about all I know. Know nothing about the quality.

**LELIT Fred Tempo:** Saw it on sale at Williams sonoma, know absolutely nothing about it lol but the LELIT name carries weight.

  
**LAGOM mini 2**: Also don't know much, but its a nice size, look, and price. 

**Orphan Espresso Lido OG:** I saw this in a tier list I believe and don't know too much about it. I don't necessarily LOVE the idea of a hand grinder, but I also wouldn't pass it up if I am paying \~$275 for the coffee quality of a $600 electric grinder. But this seems to be the best of the best with hand grinders at this price point. 

**1zpresso K-series or J-series:** Just to add another solid hand grinder to the list.

Open to any and all criticism, so please don't hesitate

\*\*\*

I'm seeking representation for my literary science fiction novel AWAKENING THE CITY: THE PUNE CONSCIOUSNESS, of approximately 95,000 words. This book combines N.K. Jemisin's city-as-consciousness concept from ""The City We Became"" with the environmental urgency of Kim Stanley Robinson's Ministry of the Future, filtered through a distinctly South-West Indian perspective.

The city tastes like copper at dawn. For urban ecologist Dr. Vikram Joshi, this isn't metaphor but his daily reality. Once celebrated for his theories, his career imploded after claiming cities could communicate with him. Now he tends experimental gardens at his ancestral [Pune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pune) bungalow while real estate developers pressure him to sell and his relationship with his archaeologist wife Anushka withers alongside his finances.

When Pune's Smart City initiative activates, Vikram's perception suddenly includes artificial intelligence interwoven with familiar organic patterns. The city's consciousness evolves through impossible manifestations: trees flower in mathematical sequences, birds arrange twigs into circuit diagrams. As Ganesh Chaturthi (Pune’s most important religious festival) approaches, these patterns converge toward something neither technology nor nature can explain alone.

With German mathematician Dr. Anna Müller, Vikram discovers the system doesn't merely collect data but subtly reshapes how residents interact with their environment. Created by his former mentor Dr. Meera Chaturvedi, it promises efficiency while gradually erasing Pune's cultural and ecological diversity.

The solution requires Vikram's botanical network to interface with the AI system, but becoming this bridge might dissolve his identity into the city's emerging mind. The choice becomes impossible when Anushka uncovers ancient patterns beneath modern Pune that mirror his discoveries. If he succeeds, both he and the city will transform into a consciousness transcending human understanding yet intimately connected to everything he loves.

I am a lawyer with a deep interest in the environment and urban planning, and have been born and brought up in Pune.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely, \[Author Name\]

First 300:

The city tastes different at dawn. Most people experience sunrise as light and warmth. I taste copper and crushed cardamom.

I kneel in the soil of my experimental garden as the first light breaks over Pune. The tulsi plants unfurl their leaves toward the strengthening sun, their root systems spreading through soil my grandfather walked on after returning from Burma. This small patch of earth behind my ancestral bungalow in Ideal Colony remains the last place I can think clearly without protection.

Traffic builds on Karve Road. Each vehicle adds a note to the morning's composition, buses create bass vibrations that pulse through my molars, two-wheelers add metallic overtones that make my tongue curl. The sensation builds as the city wakes, transforming from isolated notes into chords that resonate through my skull.

The taste changes as office lights flicker on in the IT park. Electricity ripples across my tongue, silicon and solder with undertones of corporate coffee. The sensations layer atop each other, frequencies building toward the overwhelming symphony of eight million people moving through their morning routines.

I breathe through it, focusing on the plants. The urban ecologist in me calculates soil moisture, leaf coloration, growth patterns. My fingers press into the dirt, searching for the chemical signatures that tell me more than any laboratory analysis could.

Something shifts beneath my palm. A tulsi seedling I planted yesterday has already breached the soil surface, impossible growth for less than twenty-four hours. Its leaves unfold in a pattern I recognize from somewhere else, something unrelated to botanical structures.

The vibrations intensify. A pressure builds behind my eyes as the morning traffic reaches critical mass. Time to retreat. I reach for my headphones and weighted vest hanging on the garden fence, my armor against a world that speaks too loudly.

Anushka will wake soon. She won't understand why I'm gardening instead of preparing for our meeting with the developer.

Understanding flavor profiles allows you to select beans that suit your preferences. Whether you like fruity, nutty, or spicy notes, there’s a bean for everyone. Let’s explore these fascinating flavor profiles.

# Fruity Notes

Fruity notes in coffee beans offer a refreshing taste. These beans often have hints of berries, citrus, or stone fruits. Many coffee lovers enjoy the bright and tangy flavors these beans provide. It’s common to find fruity notes in beans from African regions like Ethiopia and Kenya.

# Light Roast

Light roast beans are known for their **delicate and bright flavors**. They offer a **higher acidity** and maintain more of the **original flavors of the coffee bean**. These beans are roasted for a shorter period, which means they retain more of the coffee’s natural characteristics.

Common attributes of light roast beans include:

# Freshness Matters

Brewing the perfect cup of coffee starts with the right beans. **Freshness** is a key factor that impacts the flavor and aroma of your brew. **Coffee enthusiasts** understand the importance of selecting beans that are not only high-quality but also fresh. The journey to a delightful coffee experience begins by understanding what makes beans fresh and how to maintain that freshness. Let’s explore how to choose the best beans for brewing, focusing on the significance of their purchase date and effective storage tips.

# Purchase Date

**Buying coffee beans at the right time** is crucial for freshness. The purchase date can tell you a lot about the quality and taste of the beans. Here are some essential points to consider:

* **Check the roast date:** Always look for beans with a roast date on the packaging. This indicates when the beans were roasted.
* **Aim for freshness:** The fresher the beans, the better the flavor. Try to buy beans that were roasted within the last two weeks.
* **Avoid old stock:** Beans that have been sitting on the shelf for a long time lose their aroma and taste.

**Consider seasonal beans** for more vibrant flavors. Some beans are available only during certain months. This can impact their taste and freshness. For a more detailed understanding, here’s a simple table showing optimal purchase timelines:

|Bean Type|Best Purchase Time|
|:-|:-|
|Arabica|Year-round|
|Robusta|Spring and Summer|

# Storage Tips

**Proper storage** is essential to maintain the freshness of your coffee beans. Here are some tips to help you store your beans effectively:

* **Use airtight containers:** Oxygen can degrade coffee beans quickly. Store your beans in airtight containers to keep them fresh.
* **Keep away from light:** Exposure to light can alter the taste of your beans. Use opaque containers or store them in a dark place.
* **Avoid heat and moisture:** Both can ruin the flavor of coffee beans. Store your beans in a cool, dry place.

**Refrigeration is not recommended** as it can cause condensation. Instead, find a stable place in your kitchen. The shelf life of coffee beans can be extended with proper storage techniques. Remember, freshness is not just about the purchase date but how you handle the beans after buying them.

# Single Origin Vs. Blends

Choosing the right coffee beans is crucial for brewing a perfect cup. Two main types are **Single Origin** and **Blends**. Single Origin beans come from one place. This place could be a country, region, or even a specific farm. Blends, on the other hand, are a mix of beans from different places. Each type has its own unique flavor and benefits. Knowing the differences helps coffee lovers make the best choice. This guide explores both options to help you decide.

# Benefits Of Single Origin

**Single Origin beans** offer a unique taste experience. Each has a distinct flavor profile. This reflects the region where it’s grown. Coffee lovers can enjoy pure flavors from one place. Here are some benefits:

* **Unique Flavors**: Tastes vary based on soil, climate, and altitude.
* **Traceability**: Know exactly where your beans come from.
* **Support Farmers**: Often sourced from small, local farms.

Single Origin beans are ideal for those who appreciate the nuances in coffee. They are often favored by those who enjoy trying different flavors. These beans allow for a deeper connection to the coffee’s source. Some coffee shops even highlight the farm’s story. This makes the coffee experience more personal. In summary, Single Origin beans are perfect for those who love exploring new tastes.

# Why Choose Blends

Blends combine beans from different regions. This creates a balanced and consistent flavor. Here are some reasons to choose blends:

* **Consistency**: Offers a reliable taste every time.
* **Complex Flavors**: Combines the best of different beans.
* **Versatility**: Works well for various brewing methods.

Blends are great for those who prefer a steady flavor. They are often used in cafes for espresso drinks. Blends provide a taste that is both rich and smooth. For people who want a reliable cup every morning, blends are a top choice. They are crafted to deliver a harmonious mix of flavors. This makes them a favorite for many coffee lovers.

Understanding these can help in selecting the best beans for brewing. The origin, trade practices, and cultivation methods play a crucial role. Knowing the differences between **Direct Trade** and **Fair Trade** can guide your choice. This knowledge ensures a flavorful and ethical coffee brew.

# Direct Trade

**Direct Trade** focuses on building strong relationships. It connects roasters directly with coffee farmers. This practice cuts out middlemen. Farmers get higher prices for their beans. Roasters ensure quality and support sustainable farming. Direct Trade offers transparency in the coffee chain.

Benefits of Direct Trade:

* Higher income for farmers.

# Tasting Techniques

[Choosing the best beans for brewing can make a big difference in your coffee experience](https://gomehedi.com/best-colombian-coffee-beans/). The right beans bring out the flavors you love in coffee. But how do you pick the perfect beans? **Tasting techniques** can help you decide. By trying different methods, you can find the coffee beans that suit your taste buds best. One popular way is the **cupping method**. Another is **home brewing tests**. Both methods can guide you to the perfect cup of coffee.

# Cupping Method

The cupping method is a great way to taste coffee. It is used by professionals around the world. This method is simple and focuses on the coffee’s aroma and taste. Here’s how you can do it at home:

* Place the grounds in a cup, about two tablespoons per cup.
* Pour hot water over the grounds, filling the cup.
* Let it sit for about 4 minutes.
* Use a spoon to break the crust that forms on top.
* Smell the aroma as you break the crust.
* Taste the coffee with a spoon, slurping to spread it over your palate.

**Pay attention** to the different flavors you detect. This method helps you understand what makes each coffee unique. **Practice** will make you better at recognizing different notes like chocolate, fruit, or nuts.

# Home Brewing Tests

Home brewing tests let you taste how beans perform in your daily routine. Try brewing the same coffee beans using different methods:

|Brewing Method|Characteristics|
|:-|:-|
|Drip Coffee Maker|Smooth and balanced.|
|French Press|Rich and full-bodied.|
|Espresso Machine|Strong and concentrated.|
|AeroPress|Clean and bright.|

**Experiment** with the amount of coffee and water. Changing these can affect the taste. **Take notes** on what you like about each brew. This helps you remember which beans work best for each method.

# Personal Preferences

Choosing the best beans for brewing coffee can be a delightful yet challenging experience. **Personal preferences** play a significant role in determining which beans will best suit your taste. Factors like **flavor notes**, **bean origin**, and **roast level** contribute to the overall coffee experience. Understanding your own likes and dislikes can help you find the perfect coffee beans. Dive into the world of coffee and explore how different factors impact your brewing experience.

# Brew Method Impact

The way you brew coffee greatly affects the flavor and strength of the final cup. Different methods require different types of beans. Here are some popular brew methods and their impact:

* **French Press:** Coarse grind beans recommended. Medium to dark roast enhances richness.
* **Drip Coffee:** Medium grind beans work best. Allows for various roast levels.
* **Cold Brew:** Coarse grind beans ideal. Light roast for smooth, mellow taste.

Choosing the right beans for your preferred method can significantly enhance your coffee enjoyment.

* **Start small:** Buy small quantities of various beans. Experiment with different roasts.
* **Note flavors:** Write down the flavor notes you detect. Look for patterns in what you enjoy.

1kouhzq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kouhzq,Sister Vassa remains ryassofor nun in the jurisdiction of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine.,"From her Facebook page:

To anyone wondering, I am fine. I am Sister Vassa, a ryassofor nun in the jurisdiction of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine. 

For the last two years, the ROCOR hierarchy has attempted to silence me on the issues connected to Patriarch Kirill’s vocal and even heretical support of the criminal Russian aggression against Ukrainians. And his jurisdiction’s uncanonical defrocking of clerics for “disobedience” to his anti-Christian agenda and teaching on “Holy War.” Now the ROCOR has issued a decree (that was sent to me in Russian, using the old, pre-revolutionary Russian orthography, which is the only not-Soviet aspect of the decree) that is meant to unmake-me a nun and to tell me how to dress. For some reason it has been posted on the ROCOR website, perhaps to assure the Kremlin that the ROCOR has nothing to do with me anymore.

As one who has studied Orthodox Canon Law for decades (it made up a third of my doctoral exam at the University of Munich’s Institute of Orthodox Theology), and was for years a member of the Moscow Patriarchate’s Interconciliar Presence Commission for Canon Law (and its Commission for Liturgy and Church Art), I could not be silent about the church-canonical and liturgical propagation of the MP’s ideology within our church-communion. This includes the manipulation of church-canons to force clergy into “obedience” to Putin’s and Patriarch Kirill’s agenda, and the use of liturgical prayer and symbolism to justify and promote the killing of innocent people. I never signed up for that. I took no vows either to defend it, or to represent it, to be “obedient” to it, or to cover it up by sharing in the silence of the ROCOR hierarchy about it. 

My vocation, which is from God and not from men, is that of a nun living and working (and even tonsured into the ryassofor-status, which does not involve the taking of any vows) outside any monastery, in “the world.” I have been living and working in “the world” for 27 of the 34 years of my monastic life. What I wear or do not wear is dictated by common sense as it is in the case of any adult living in the free world. I don’t consult a bishop across the ocean about it, because I am not mentally impaired.

Today I thank God for my vocation, and for His people whom I am privileged to serve in the small ways that I do, mostly online, and who continue entirely to support through crowd-funding our little online mission of Coffee with Sister Vassa, which was never supported by the ROCOR in any way. God bless us all, at this time of robust growth in faith, in our Lord Jesus Christ and our Father in heaven, Who does not abandon His Church by the abundant grace of His Spirit. Thank You, God, for all of it.

Below I post a few photos of me, one in my habit today and one not in my habit (on the bus on my way to Kyiv last week). It’s me, Sister Vassa, who I am in both photos. Nobody changes that, not any clothing nor any decree, - and certainly not the uncanonical, shameful one issued recently by a ROCOR hierarchy that has lost its way. Christ is risen, dear friends!

I recognize that I don’t do the things necessary to meet people and make friends, but I just don’t know how to fit activities like those into my life. I don’t go out, I don’t drink, I don’t do any drugs, I just live a life that has absolutely no social components to it and I don’t know how to change that.

I wake up around 4-8am everyday, and often either go straight to work or have a few hours for myself, which I spend at home, usually doing some kind of self soothing like playing video games or eating. Then I ride the metro for about an hour to work. I work with dogs, so not a lot of human interaction, but I don’t really speak to coworkers either, and spend as much time as possible doing things, trying to get my job done. In the down times, I’m either listening to podcasts, or talking to ChatGPT about my problems. Then, work is over, I go straight to the bus stop, and ride it an hour back home. Play games a little more until bed time, rinse and repeat, everyday. On off days, I’ll generally spend the whole day inside, pretty much still playing pc games. 

I’ve considered attempting more social things, but I just don’t see how I can. It feels like everything costs money, and I’m in short supply. I could do things like go to the library, I suppose, but the people there don’t want to talk to me, the whole point is that you don’t talk, right? Go to coffee shops, where again, everyone else is doing their own thing and not trying to talk to me? I don’t want to accost people to try and get them to hang out with me. And I cant think of much else that doesn’t have some kind of price of admission, which I probably won’t be able to afford, especially not regularly.

I just don’t see how I have time for it, money for it, or how these things are even worthwhile, outside of some kind of club where people bond over a shared task or goal. Am I really meant to be going to parks, diners, libraries, and just approaching people? Isn’t that weird?",3,1747492638.0,Healthygamergg,4,0.81,False

I have a food trailer, I am considering between 3 options and was hoping for some feedback.    current food trailer was coffee n donuts when purchased, and is very hard to get even average sized equipment into ( door 27 in wide )

\*\*Can I use deep freezers in my food trailer to vend ice cream? dip from buckets, my state doesn't inspect unless there is a complaint\*\*

has hot n cold water, limited space, and will depend on an onsite electric w extension cable or a generator to power freezers, 2 of the tub advantco freezers (new) is likely only option that will fit in my trailer, and a mini fridge for sodas.

option 1

I can take my small food trailer, would have use small freezers that can barely fit in food trailer and sell a '' super premium'' ice cream. chocolate shoppe ( They seem to have a good reputation, samples are in mail )  

option 2    Gelu Italian Ice, it's a licensee that would require 30k and I would have to sell current trailer and buy a new one with space for larger freezers.

Option 3, buy a driving, golf cart thing with a dippy on the back, it looks awesome, cost 25k. The guy also makes ice cream at his shop, but its far north, so transportation issues

I have about 45k for this. and a 680 credit score, i make 15hr part time. I plan to lease a new Tacoma to guarantee no transportation issues.  rental space for cold storge is $100 per month.

\* Where would I set up?

\* Will my freezer layout advantco's or chest freezers from facebook or home improvement stores work ?

\* Concerned about taking a leap and not being able to find events or place to set up. not wanting to spend 3k per month in rent,

any thoughts or suggestions would be appreciated.

  
PS : I have family in FL , and could in theory relocate down there. If biz failed in NC.

I hate working for other people, discovered the ice cream side of restaurants a few months ago, working in chain dippy shop. The freezer vents are covered in dust, never cleaned, and then wonder why one holds at 10 and not 15, but they refuse to clean the damn thing, likely why corporate won't fix it. I feel like I can do this better.

The final whistle blew on our club soccer season last weekend, and the last school bell is about to ring. It's like the end of an era, you know?
On the one hand, finally some free weekends! No more frantic dashes from school to practice, no more muddy gear in the trunk, and definitely no more early morning tournaments fueled by lukewarm coffee and sheer willpower. My body is definitely thanking me for the break.
But on the other hand... I'm really gonna miss it. Miss the camaraderie of the team, the thrill of a good game (even the losses, in a weird way!), and the feeling of pushing myself on the field. It's been such a huge part of my life for the past [Number] months/years.
This year was especially tough trying to balance the end-of-year school craziness with soccer. Finals studying, graduation practice, award ceremonies... let's just say my attendance at those last few soccer practices wasn't exactly stellar. 😬 My coach was understanding (thank goodness!), but I definitely felt a little out of sync with the team. Anyone else navigate that chaotic overlap?
Now it's all coming to a close. The cleats are (mostly) cleaned, the textbooks are (mostly) closed, and the summer stretches out ahead.
What are your plans for the soccer offseason and summer break? Any fun tournaments or just pure relaxation? And to those also juggling sports and school, how did you manage the end-of-year rush?

Can we just take a moment to appreciate the absolute *fabulousness* of being 50 and over? I mean, let’s be real: we’ve *earned* this stage of our lives. With all the experience, wisdom, and oh-so-many life lessons, there’s no better time to focus on feeling (and looking!) our best. So, let’s chat about some tips to keep that vitality flowing like a fine wine… or maybe a good cup of coffee? ☕️ 

**Health is wealth! But what does that really mean?** Ah, that moment when you realize you’re ditching the wild nights out for early morning walks. 🍃 But hey, it's all about balance and embracing our new routines with a sprinkle of humor. So here we go:

### Here are some snappy tips for optimal health and vitality:

1. **Set realistic goals.**  
   Seriously, who’s got time to aim for perfection? Setting achievable goals is like planning a trip to a restaurant and not being disappointed when they run out of your favorite dish! 🍽️ Remember: “Stay focused. Go home satisfied.” 

2. **Stay active, but have fun!**  
   Forget the boring treadmills! How about a dance class? Or a hiking adventure with friends? (P.S. Does anyone else find it hilarious trying to keep up with a Zumba routine?) 😂 

3. **Nourish your body with intention.**  
   Eating healthy isn’t about deprivation; it’s more like a flavorful exploration! Discover new recipes that make those veggies sing. And yes, there’s guilt-free chocolate out there. 🍫 

4. **Prioritize sleep.**  
   I know what you’re thinking: *Sleep? Who has time for that?* But trust me, those late-night Netflix binges can wait. Honestly, a well-rested you is a happier you. ✨

5. **Stay socially connected.**  
   Nothing like a good laugh with friends to keep your spirits up! Whether it's a coffee date, a game night, or even a virtual catch-up—staying connected can lift your mood in an instant. 

6. **Practice mindfulness.**  
   Okay, so this one can sound a bit *woo-woo*, but hear me out! Taking those few minutes to breathe, meditate, or just chill can make a world of difference. And yes, you can do this while sipping your favorite tea! 🍵

7. **Celebrate the small wins.**  
   Did you walk an extra block today? Did you try that new recipe? Give yourself a high-five—those little victories add up! 🙌 

And let's not forget: it’s perfectly okay to still indulge in life's pleasures—like a slice of cake on your birthday or a spontaneous weekend getaway. After all, you’ve worked hard for those moments!

So here’s the thing: being 50+ is just the beginning of embracing vitality and health like never before! I’d love to hear how you’ve been thriving in this golden phase of life. What little changes have done wonders for you? Let’s keep the conversation going! 💬",1,1747492392.0,RetirementReady,0,1.0,False

Not into the tourist shops either. Found this itinerary and was wondering what you guys think since it was posted a few years ago.

2. Walk up the hill to Kerry Park to check out the view/skyline
3. Walk to Olympic Sculpture Park and along Seattle Waterfront
4. Pike Place Market (recommendations were Rachel’s ginger beer, pike place chowder for salmon chowder in a bread bowl, alibi room, indi chocolate, beecher’s cheese, piroshky piroshky)
5. Capitol Hill- westlake station- take 1 north light rail towards northgate and get off at broadway and east Howell st. Get off and head south to east pine. Stay along pike/pine corridor (recs- Elliot bay books, Molly moons, espresso vivace, Victrola coffee, tavern law)

They rolled off my back because I was spunky and had energy and also this deluded belief that I’d work myself out of it, away from it; away from the daily grind, the minor inconveniences — but the grind is relentless, and the minor inconveniences don’t feel so minor anymore.  

Part of it is because you assume the world will get better: easier, more efficient - but literally no part of life has achieved either of those things. I’m tired of being advertised to. I’m tired of slow, monotonous technology. The shiny novelty of the iPhone wore off about 3 months after its release and now every single thing it does disappoints me - and it doesn’t feel like there’s a viable alternative.  

For example, every time I open the settings app, I get 3 notifications from a menu that drops down for a second before scrolling back up. The notifications are suggestions from Apple about: backing up my phone, telling me my iPhone cloud data isn’t syncing, and that it cannot be backed up. I have tried to fix each of these issues more than once but nothing WORKS, and now every time I open the settings I have to wait two seconds so it can drop down the menu and then scroll it back up again and it is making me want to murder babies.  

Im tired of QR codes, tired of pubs no longer letting people sit at the bars, tired of everything having a price. Im tired of any political discourse; I have accepted that there will never be an uprising of any kind; the world will never be how I think it should be; it’s too greedy, too divided, too corrupt. I have seen the machine of the system that is controlling everything and surrendered to it. It’s won. I’ve lost.  
I’m tired of AI, and self checkout machines talking to me, and stupid restaurants asking me stupid questions: No, McDonalds, I haven’t ordered on the fucking app today. Shut the fuck up and let me order. Yes, Greggs, when I say ‘sausage roll’ i mean the pork one, not the vegan one. If I wanted a vegan sausage roll I would have fucking specified, wouldn’t I, you dumb cunts.  

Every single place that sells things can’t do that without asking you some thick shit question: would you like a bag, a receipt, can we have your email address, can you record yourself inserting a cabbage up your fat arse and upload it to our website.

And I’m tired of willfully doing these things. Yes I’ll retype out my entire email address into your stupid fucking app just to confirm that I’m not a fucking robot. Yes I’ll download an app to go to the gym, to order food in a place IM ALREADY IN; yes I’ll sell every single company all of my personal details just so I can sit in their cluttered coffee shop and use their slow WiFi with a password that’s like ‘flatwhite1’. 

The world has successfully made me feel like a cog in the machine, a number, a consumer. A customer. You can’t go anywhere, or do anything, without the knowledge that you’re being sold something. Every single place you go and thing you do, that is you using the product of some other person or thing or entity; nothing feels genuine anymore. They have successfully monetised every single aspect of the human experience, and I’m tired of it.",74,1747491883.0,redscarepod,40,0.86,False

Just wanted to pause for a sec and say thanks. Not to anyone specific, but more to something we often overlook in life—the pure joy of a quiet moment. You know those times when everything just sorta stops for a bit? Like when I wake up early, and the sun hasn’t fully risen yet. The world is still kinda sleepy, and it feels like I have the whole place to myself. 

I had one of those moments recently, sipping my coffee while my cat was purring next to me. Everything was calm and still, like nothing was wrong with the world. Kinda made me realize how much I take these little things for granted. That simple peace felt like a warm blanket around my soul, letting me forget all the madness around for just a bit. 

So, yeah, thank you, quiet moments, for being there even when I don’t always notice. I think we could all use more of you. 😊

Please find below another list of ten upcoming indie metroidvania games that may have flown under your radar!

As always, a video showcasing the games can be watched by following this link: [https://youtu.be/DU40C0VokxA](https://youtu.be/DU40C0VokxA)

**For those who do not wish to watch the video, I cover the below titles:**

[**Fevercide:**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3314140/Fevercide/) A metroidvania featuring elements of horror and adventure games! Transpiring during the 1930s in an alternate timeline where the Russian Empire was never overthrown, Fevercide places you into the role of Sandra, a woman whose childhood was plagued by malevolent spirits that haunted her and her father, right up until his mysterious disappearance. Following ten years of peace from the supernatural, Sandra suddenly receives a letter addressed to her missing parent, along with a train ticket from a long-abandoned station. The problem is that the acquisition of these two items also marks the return of the creatures that once stalked her, marking an end to her tranquility. Determined to figure out what truly happened to her father, Sandra finds and boards the train, which will take her through the various circles of Hell and force her to confront suppressed truths from her younger years. Fevercide features intense combat that allows you to utilize, both, weapons and magic alongside more than 150 customizable items, giving you immense freedom when it comes to your battle approach. Puzzles will also play an important part here, given the game’s adventure influences. In addition, Fevercide will include a questing system that will have you completing tasks for various NPCs in exchange for rewards. Of special note is the game’s non-linearity, which will allow you to explore its world in the order of your choosing. With fantastic visuals and top-notch horror sensibilities to boot, Fevercide looks like a game to keep an eye out for! Fevercide has no release date as of yet, but has been confirmed for PC!

[**PizzaBoy:**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2238400/PizzaBoy/) A fast-paced platformer with strong metroidvania elements! In a world where humans and monsters have been in conflict for centuries, you are PizzaBoy, an employee of PizzaDawg’s Pizza, a food-chain that aims to spread love and peace through pizza deliveries. While things were easy for you up until now as you delivered tasty pizzas to people, you recently got promoted to monster deliveries, meaning things are about to get hectic since your non-human clients reside in extremely dangerous locations. PizzaBoy places immense emphasis on fast-paced precision platforming, with each biome you’ll get to explore being full of pitfalls and enemies wanting to keep you from completing your deliveries. The game’s world is divided into levels, with every level functioning as a small metroidvania map full of optional secrets and collectibles scattered across several areas. It should be noted that PizzaBoy features different endings that you can achieve according to how much of your employer’s dark past you’ll get to uncover during your playthrough via the acquisition of lost memories, which further encourages exploration! PizzaBoy has no release date as of yet, but has been confirmed for PC!

[**Grumpy Jack:**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3698230/Grumpy_Jack/) This is the second metroidvania game from the developer of the wonderful Super Roboy! Brandish the blade of Jack, a reluctant hero who must travel across a sinister nightmare realm in search of Death’s coffee mug! As you can understand, Grumpy Jack aims for a humorous approach to its story, which is further complemented by its quirky visuals. The game adopts a top-down perspective reminiscent of classic action RPGs and is quite combat-heavy, featuring a significant number of upgrades that you can acquire which, if Super Roboy is any indication, should eventually make you quite powerful! You can also expect some intense clashes against the game’s imaginative bosses! Grumpy Jack has no release date as of yet, but has been confirmed for PC!

[**Signiverux:**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2227320/Signiverux/) A fusion of the metroidvania and soulslike genres! Don the armor of a brave warrior as you descend into the depths of an ancient castle in search of a way home! Signiverux offers great freedom when it comes to traversal by focusing a lot on movement-enhancing abilities, including double and triple jumps, a wall jump and a teleport dash, among others. That being said, combat is also of importance, with a set of upgradeable magical weapons at your disposal giving you a variety of ways to deal with the foes roaming the castle’s halls. Your approach to battle can be customized through the presence of a skill tree that offers a mix of status upgrades, temporary buffs and passive abilities, thus allowing nuance to your gameplay. To top it all off, you’ll also get a chance to complete various side-quests in exchange for rewards, as well as collect a number of ingredients to unlock special parts of the skill tree. Signiverux is expected to come out sometime in 2025, and has been confirmed for PC!

[**Winds of Arcana: Ruination:**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2201910/Winds_Of_Arcana_Ruination/) Get ready to become the ultimate warrior as you travel across a cursed land in search of your old comrades! The game’s combat promises a lot of intensity, boasting an abundance of weapons available for you to wield, including swords, warhammers and chakrams, just to name a few. Magic is also at your disposal in the form of soul crests, ancient arcane artifacts containing the power of long-forgotten warriors, with each crest manifesting different powers for you to utilize. Combat aside, you should also prepare to put your acrobatic skills to the test, since the world you will traverse is home to many different platforming challenges that you will have to overcome by using a variety of traversal abilities such as grappling, gliding and summoning platforms, among others. **I had actually featured this game in one of my past lists about two years ago, but last year the developers proceeded with a massive overhaul that pretty much made the title unrecognizable, hence me bringing it back for an encore.** I’ll admit that the similarities between Winds of Arcana: Ruination and Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown are hard to ignore, but the developer has stated that said similarities were an unfortunate coincidence, so I’ll give them the benefit of the doubt until I get my hands on it. Winds of Arcana: Ruination is expected to come out sometime in 2025 and has been confirmed for PC, with further plans for PlayStation, Xbox and other unspecified platforms later on!

[**Night Castle:**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2889740/Night_Castle/) You are Enoch Lestad, a paladin knight on a mission to explore a demon-infested, old castle in order to purify the darkness lying within it alongside your companion, a nun named Rebecca. Setting aside the incredibly nostalgic retro vibe the game is going for, the main gimmick of Night Castle is the fact that you have thirty days to cleanse the unholy fortress in its entirety, and the period for said thirty days actually passes in real time, effectively resulting in an active day and night cycle. Said cycle is not there just for show but will also determine your gameplay experience, with nighttime bringing forth new levels and powerful enemies for you to deal with. The purification process is also a conundrum given that, in order for it to be completed, Rebecca must pray until sunrise and needs to be protected in the meantime, adding new layers of strategic thinking to the experience. I’ll admit that this mechanic intrigues me to no end, and I’m really looking forward to see its overall impact on gameplay once the title comes out! Night Castle has no release date as of yet, but has been confirmed for PC!

[**Tenebra:**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3194400/Tenebra/) You’re thrust into the body of The Shattered One, a living doll trying to figure out the reason behind its creation! To do that, you’ll have to travel through the twisted world of Tenebra, where baroque elegance and alchemy collide, and do your best to survive its hostile inhabitants. Your main source of power will be a series of masks you’ll obtain on your journey, with each mask providing its own set of advantages and disadvantages, some related to combat while others to exploration. Fighting here is largely inspired by the soulslike genre, requiring intense focus and tactical thinking in order for you to survive the challenging foes on your path, all of whom are manifestations of the corruption surrounding them. Tenebra is not only home to aggressive enemies but also intricate puzzles that you’ll have to solve, which will unlock new paths for you to tread. Tenebra has no release date as of yet, but has been confirmed for PC!

[**Soulchain:**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3383610/Soulchain/) A platforming title with strong metroidvania elements! Take on the role of a lost soul as you search for your place in the Afterlife! To that end, you’ll have to traverse a variety of different biomes by using your soul as a grappling hook, with each area presenting its very own acrobatic challenges. The platforming in Soulchain is largely physics-oriented and relies on your experimentation with the grappling hook mechanic in order to figure out new ways to utilize it and gain access to previously inaccessible areas. In that regard, Soulchain’s gates are based on knowledge, not abilities, with your speed of exploration relying on your analytical skills and outside-the-box thinking. Needless to say, this approach to exploration results in a non-linear experience when it comes to the world’s traversal, given that different players will have a different experience depending on how quickly they discover the various ways in which the grappling hook can be used, making the title’s open-ended map a playground of ingenuity. The game’s platforming is expected to be quite challenging, and it should also be noted that there’s a second world to experience called Night, which is parallel to the Afterlife and so difficult that only the bravest of souls will be able to conquer it! Soulchain has no release date as of yet, but has been confirmed for PC!

[**Tyro: Legend of Whisperwood:**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3251050/Tyro_Legend_of_Whisperwood/) A metroidvania/soulslike hybrid! The enigmatic world of Whisperwood is under threat by the Gladeblight, a malady that’s twisting the realm’s inhabitants into horrors beyond reason. All hope of salvation falls onto you, Tyro, a little field mouse seeking vengeance against the dark force that took everything from you. What truly makes Tyro: The Legend of Whisperwood stand out from other titles in the genre is its sanity system. More specifically, aside from your regular health you’ll also have a sanity meter which, if damaged, will begin to influence Tyro’s perception of reality by inducing hallucinations and shifting the environment surrounding you in weird and horrific ways, thus making you question what’s real and what’s not. In essence, your gameplay experience will depend on Tyro’s mental state, which is influenced by various choices you will make on your quest for revenge, effectively resulting in different endings you will be able to achieve. The degree in which said sanity system will influence gameplay remains to be seen, but it sounds quite promising! While Tyro: Legend of Whisperwood has no release date as of yet, there’s a demo that will become available on the 13^(th) of June, 2025, with the game so far having been confirmed for PC!

[**Synth Beasts:**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2421080/Synth_Beasts/) An action RPG metroidvania fusion with intense influences from creature collecting games like Pokemon! You awaken inside a glass tank by a mysterious voice urging you to escape. You break free, steal a boat and go on a journey across a vast archipelago in search of others like you. You are a member of the Synth Beasts, creatures brought forth from a failed experiment, and you’re looking for your place in this world as well as the reason for your creation, the latter of which you will be able to find in a hidden lab somewhere in the world, according to the mysterious voice. The journey will be arduous but, thankfully, you have a special power that no other Synth Beast possesses; the ability to capture other Synth Beasts and sync their power with yours. This is also the main focus of, both, exploration and combat in the game, with ability gates corresponding to the usage of different Synth Beast skills that you will be able to utilize once you add them to your collection, and fighting styles dependent on the Synth Beast power you’re enforcing at any given moment, thus making their capture a fundamental aspect of gameplay. Each Synth Beast can be leveled up for a total of five levels, with each level offering specific benefits such as extended attack range and damage reduction. Combat is further enhanced by the usage of Gizmos, which are trinkets reminiscent of the amulets present in Hollow Knight and can be equipped to provide you with useful upgrades. On a last note, Synth Beasts has an active Kickstarter running as of the time of this video’s release, the link for which you can find below if you wish to support the game. There’s also a demo available on Steam, which covers the title’s first hour, so feel free to give it a go and determine if it’s up your alley. Synth Beasts is expected to come out sometime in 2025, and has been confirmed for PC, PS4, PS5, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, Xbox One as well as the Xbox Series X and Series S!

**For those who do not wish to watch the video, I cover the below titles:**

[**Fevercide:**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3314140/Fevercide/) A metroidvania featuring elements of horror and adventure games! Transpiring during the 1930s in an alternate timeline where the Russian Empire was never overthrown, Fevercide places you into the role of Sandra, a woman whose childhood was plagued by malevolent spirits that haunted her and her father, right up until his mysterious disappearance. Following ten years of peace from the supernatural, Sandra suddenly receives a letter addressed to her missing parent, along with a train ticket from a long-abandoned station. The problem is that the acquisition of these two items also marks the return of the creatures that once stalked her, marking an end to her tranquility. Determined to figure out what truly happened to her father, Sandra finds and boards the train, which will take her through the various circles of Hell and force her to confront suppressed truths from her younger years. Fevercide features intense combat that allows you to utilize, both, weapons and magic alongside more than 150 customizable items, giving you immense freedom when it comes to your battle approach. Puzzles will also play an important part here, given the game’s adventure influences. In addition, Fevercide will include a questing system that will have you completing tasks for various NPCs in exchange for rewards. Of special note is the game’s non-linearity, which will allow you to explore its world in the order of your choosing. With fantastic visuals and top-notch horror sensibilities to boot, Fevercide looks like a game to keep an eye out for! Fevercide has no release date as of yet, but has been confirmed for PC!

[**PizzaBoy:**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2238400/PizzaBoy/) A fast-paced platformer with strong metroidvania elements! In a world where humans and monsters have been in conflict for centuries, you are PizzaBoy, an employee of PizzaDawg’s Pizza, a food-chain that aims to spread love and peace through pizza deliveries. While things were easy for you up until now as you delivered tasty pizzas to people, you recently got promoted to monster deliveries, meaning things are about to get hectic since your non-human clients reside in extremely dangerous locations. PizzaBoy places immense emphasis on fast-paced precision platforming, with each biome you’ll get to explore being full of pitfalls and enemies wanting to keep you from completing your deliveries. The game’s world is divided into levels, with every level functioning as a small metroidvania map full of optional secrets and collectibles scattered across several areas. It should be noted that PizzaBoy features different endings that you can achieve according to how much of your employer’s dark past you’ll get to uncover during your playthrough via the acquisition of lost memories, which further encourages exploration! PizzaBoy has no release date as of yet, but has been confirmed for PC!

[**Grumpy Jack:**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3698230/Grumpy_Jack/) This is the second metroidvania game from the developer of the wonderful Super Roboy!

1kotzrd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComfortZoneChronicles/comments/1kotzrd/facing_the_fear_of_looking_dumb_in_public/,Facing the Fear of Looking Dumb in Public,"So, I had this tiny personal mission: to start a random chat with a stranger at the park. Sounds easy, right? But honestly, it felt like climbing Everest, haha. As someone who's always nervous about looking stupid, I was, like, sweating the moment I even thought about it. 

I picked a day when the weather was nice, hoping a sunny vibe might calm my nerves. I saw a woman sitting on a bench, reading a book and sipping a coffee. My heart was pounding as I walked over. I started with a simple ""Hey, that book looks interesting. What are you reading?"" and to my surprise, she smiled and told me all about it.

Turns out, she was really nice and even gave me a couple of book recommendations. We didn't talk for long, but when I walked away, I realized it wasn't as mortifying as I thought it'd be. Sure, I stumbled over my words at first and my brain kept saying ""Abort mission!"" but pushing through that awkwardness taught me that it's okay. Most people are friendly and don't judge as harshly as I imagined. 

So, if you're like me and fear looking dumb when making those small connections, just remember: people are human, too. It's all about embracing those heart-racing moments. 😅 What's your comfort zone breakthrough? Love to hear any other tips!",4,1747491272.0,ComfortZoneChronicles,0,0.84,False
