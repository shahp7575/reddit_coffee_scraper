1hshiuc,https://i.redd.it/wb2ksiqjkqae1.jpeg,Anyone else addicted to this stuff?,"Went caffeine and alcohol free for almost 6 months last year because I was getting huge headaches (mainly upon waking up). Turns out it made no difference to the headaches and have since been diagnosed with Obstructive sleep apnea. Anyway, I noticed other health benefits from the caffeine alcohol free new me I’d created to strives to carry on. The alcohol bit weirdly was easier that caffeine for me. I didn’t actually drink that much at home, but had a few pints when I went to football games with mates a few times a month. I carried on drinking alcohol free beers and havnt turned back!!! 

Tea and coffee I found harder though, that’s where this stuff came in. I love it! Let the bag brew for a god 4 mins, a spoonful of honey (my dad keeps bees 🐝 👌🏻) or a sweetener and it’s perfect. Can even have a splash of milk in it if you feel like it.

Anyway, I still treat myself to 1 caffeinated drink like a cappuccino on special occasions if we go to a nice cafe etc and I really enjoy it. Very rare though. The rest of the time. I have this stuff. 

Anyone else? I have started limiting myself to two a day as heard that rooibos can potentially have some long term bad effects on the liver and kidneys but not sure on the science behind it? 

If you havnt given it a go, do it! 

Even better, I found a shop near my dad where they sell a box of 50 bags for 25p 🤣

These burrs can significantly enhance the grinding performance, potentially leading to improved flavor extraction and consistency in the cup.

Upgrading to SSP MP burrs could offer several advantages for the Timemore Sculptor 78S:

|**Enhanced Grind Consistency:** SSP burrs are engineered to provide a highly consistent grind size, which can improve the flavor clarity and balance in brewed coffee. This consistency is particularly beneficial for methods such as espresso and pour-over, where precise grind size plays a crucial role in extraction. **Durability and Longevity:** Made from high-quality materials, SSP burrs are designed to be long-lasting and durable, potentially offering a longer lifespan than standard burrs. This could mean less frequent replacement and maintenance costs over time. **Flavor Profile Customization:** The design of SSP MP burrs can allow for specific flavor enhancements, depending on the grind size and technique used.

1hshdsl,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1hshdsl/cozy_yet_stylish_the_best_reading_chairs_for/,Cozy Yet Stylish: The Best Reading Chairs for Every Space,"A reading chair isn’t just a seat; it’s a haven for book lovers—a cozy corner where you can escape into stories or unwind with a cup of tea. Whether you’re styling a compact reading nook indoors or creating a serene outdoor reading spot, the perfect chair combines comfort and style. Let’s explore the best reading chairs for every space, from cozy living rooms to breezy patios.

# 1. Living Room Luxe: Stylish Comfort in Your Reading Nook

In a living room, a well-placed armchair can define a cozy reading corner. Look for chairs with high backs, cushioned seats, and supportive armrests for optimal comfort during long reading sessions.

**Top Choice:** A chic accent chair paired with a throw blanket and a side table for your books is a classic option. For a seamless transition between the dining and reading areas, consider complementing your decor with [white dining chairs](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/dining-room-furniture/dining-chairs) nearby to maintain a cohesive aesthetic.

# 2. Outdoor Retreat: Reading Under the Sky

There’s something magical about reading in the open air, surrounded by nature. An [outdoor armchair](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor/seating/outdoor-armchairs) is an excellent addition to your patio or garden space, blending functionality and elegance. Opt for chairs made from weather-resistant materials to withstand the elements.

**Styling Tip:** Pair a comfortable outdoor armchair with a small table and a shade-providing umbrella for the ultimate outdoor reading setup. Complement the look with stylish [outdoor garden furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor) to create a cohesive and inviting space.

# 3. Bohemian Bliss: The Charm of Rattan Chairs

For a relaxed and trendy vibe, nothing beats the charm of a rattan chair. Its natural texture and lightweight design make it a versatile choice for indoor and outdoor spaces alike. Whether placed in a living room corner or on a balcony, a [rattan chair Dubai](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product-category/shop/furniture/rattan) can add a bohemian flair to your reading nook.

**Design Inspiration:** Add a plush cushion or throw pillow to enhance comfort and introduce pops of color to your space. Pair the chair with a soft rug and a floor lamp for an intimate and cozy atmosphere.

# 4. Bedroom Escape: A Private Reading Sanctuary

The bedroom is an ideal spot for a quiet reading corner. A compact armchair with a soft fabric finish can create a cozy sanctuary without taking up too much space. Choose calming colors to maintain the room’s restful ambiance.

**Best Pairing:** Position the chair near a window for natural light and complete the look with a side table for your favorite books. If your bedroom opens to a patio, consider a rattan chair for continuity between indoor and outdoor aesthetics.

# 5. Outdoor Garden Oasis: Serenity Among Nature

If you’re lucky enough to have a garden, turn it into a peaceful reading haven with stylish outdoor garden furniture. A comfortable armchair or loveseat can make the space inviting, while the surrounding greenery provides the perfect backdrop for relaxation.

**Pro Tip:** Choose a weatherproof outdoor armchair or a lounge chair that complements your garden's natural beauty. Add decorative cushions for a splash of color and extra comfort.

# 6. Dining Area Reading Nooks: Functional and Chic

In open-plan spaces, the dining area can double as a casual reading spot. While white dining chairs are often associated with mealtimes, they can also work as minimalist seating for a quick read or coffee break.

**Creative Idea:** Arrange a small side table next to the dining area and style a white dining chair with a throw or cushion to create a cozy corner. This dual-purpose setup is perfect for compact homes.

# What to Look for in a Reading Chair

To find the best reading chair for your space, consider the following:

* **Comfort:** Look for cushioned seats, supportive backs, and armrests.
* **Style:** Choose a design that complements your existing decor, whether that’s a modern rattan chair or a timeless upholstered armchair.
* **Durability:** For outdoor spaces, opt for weather-resistant materials to ensure longevity.
* **Size:** Consider the space available to avoid overcrowding your reading nook.

# Why Choose Rattan Chairs in Dubai?

Dubai’s furniture scene is known for offering high-quality, stylish pieces, and rattan chairs are no exception. Combining natural charm with contemporary design, a rattan chair in Dubai can elevate both indoor and outdoor reading spaces. These chairs are versatile, durable, and easy to style, making them a favorite choice for cozy yet chic reading nooks.

# Final Thoughts

Whether you’re curling up indoors or enjoying the breeze outdoors, the right reading chair is essential for creating a cozy and stylish space. From rattan chairs in Dubai to durable outdoor garden furniture, there’s a perfect option for every home. So, grab your favorite book, settle into your ideal chair, and let the pages transport you to another world.",1,1735890884.0,u_homeandsoul,0,1.0,False
1hshd5e,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNsReddit/comments/1hshd5e/new_year_new_vpn/,New year new VPN? ,"So I've been using Mullvad for around 2 years now, and over the past few years I've run into a few issues (that I've been able to sort of work around).
1. School websites block Mullvad's DNS servers -> use a different DNS server anyways
2. Frequent captchas when logging into certain sites -> log in without vpn and then enable vpn once i'm done logging in
3. No port forwarding, so I'm not really able to seed ""linux ISOs"" well sometimes

I'm considering between staying on Mullvad (5€ a month) or move to Proton (10€ a month). Both are around 1€ per device, so cost wise it's honestly sort of alright for both.

Mullvad has the bonus of being completely private (no login details and no payment logs), and being cheaper.

ProtonVPN has the benefits of port forwarding, supporting more devices (I currently have around 4 concurrent devices using Mullvad, though that may increase when I build my secondary PC).

I'm not sure about how the mobile apps fare on both. Mullvad's iOS ""kill switch"" doesn't seem to work well, sometimes it'll just drop vpn connection and browse unconnected. Haven't personally tried Proton so I don't know how its app works.

I am probably gonna set up a server next year and need to remote access into it from outside, but I haven't researched much into it so I'm unsure if my VPN selection will play any role in it. From what I see, I can set up my own vpn for that purpose. 

Ah, before I get messages saying ""you don't need a vpn"", here are my use cases:
1. I frequently connect to public hotspots like in coffee shops and in school. Sometimes websites are blocked by said wifi hotspots, like my school blocking some messaging apps. Sometimes with some poorly set up networks I don't have to give them my details to be able to access the internet, so I see that as a plus. 
2. I don't like my ISP snooping on what I do. Copyright laws here are fairly strict, so I don't want an ISP coming for my neck. My ISP also sometimes throttles P2P traffic, so avoiding that throttling is advisable. I don't worry about websites being blocked by ISP because most stuff here is DNS blocked which is easier to circumvent.
3. I frequently connect to JP servers to get content that's restricted to JP (like on youtube or other sites). I also connect to other countries to be able to get their various algorithms on search engines.


I'm likely going to stick on Mullvad unless I run into significantly more teething issues, but I'm looking to hear perspectives from both sides on it. I have about another month before I have to add more credit to mullvad, so it's not exactly an urgent decision. ",1,1735890804.0,VPNsReddit,0,1.0,False

1hshaq4,https://www.reddit.com/r/workplace_bullying/comments/1hshaq4/i_think_my_manager_schedules_me_for_the_worst/,I think my manager schedules me for the worst shifts on purpose ?,"I will cut to the chase, I started this as a 2nd job in late August/early September, while already working a full time job. I saw that including tips, I made the same wage as I did my full time job, so I had MULTIPLE conversations with my manager about going full time here (I didn't take this job initially for extra money, I took it bc I love the line of work and wanted something fun bc I hated my full time job so much) and she was super happy about that and said she would love for me to be full time, which would be 32-36 hrs/week. we were also understaffed at the time so it was even better for her. 

first schedule when I was full time came out, I got less than 20 hrs. next schedule came out, 3 days a week. I reminded her that I no longer had the other job and wanted to be scheduled full time, and again she was happy about it and said she would. long story short, that was in early November and I have had two schedules come out where I worked 5 days a week. instead of giving ANY of our employees full time, we have instead hired 3 new people and we are ALL fucking part time now, including the literal 1 other person who has requested full time (we have 8 people on our entire staff including the manager) every few weeks I remind my manager that I want full time hours and she always says that makes it so much easier for her and that she will, and then it never happens. I only get 5 days a week when I cover shifts and sometimes they ask me to come in early or stay late and I always say sure bc I need the money. 

so that sucks on its own, but I have ALSO noticed that the majority of my shifts are always closes. I work in a coffee shop, we're open 7am-6pm. after 12pm, we're dead for the rest of the day. we might have an absolute maximum of 20 more customers as opposed to 50-80 we have in the morning (PoS system shows the number of transactions and tip breakdown, thanks Toast) and closing shifts always start at 12pm :) so I barely get any tips, which is where most of my paycheck comes from. I know my manager is not stupid about this, she used to manage a bar and is constantly talking about scheduling us all in a way and cutting us to maximize the tips we make. which is not happening when I get like 15 customers tipping 0-3 dollars for my entire shift. (not the customer's fault.) there are also several days a week where she will stay a few hours late, still clocked in, but sitting in the office doing god knows what and therefor half the tips are also going to her. 

any day that I DO open, without exaggeration it is always a clopen. so I finish closing at 7pm and have to be clocked in again 6:30am. I have trained every single one of the 3 new people we've hired on how to close and how to open and I got an hour's notice every time. every single time my manager texted me 60-30mins before my opening shift to say, ""hey sorry to throw this on you but I asked xyz to come in if you could just show them how to open"" that is almost verbatim. 

I have also been texted before my shift to not even worry about coming in or to be pushed back til later bc we were ""so slow"" and didn't need another person on shift, which I have literally never experienced at any other job I've had. we also in the past month (since the first of December) started staying open until 10pm with a cocktail menu on Fridays and Saturdays. guess which days I don't get scheduled to close anymore. I was specifically asked if I wanted to work those shifts ""bc the money is gonna be really good"" and I said yeah ofc I'm happy to work as many as you want me to. I have worked 3 of them, one of them was kinda slow, the other one we closed at 6pm because we were so slow. the other one was new year's eve because I covered somebody's shift. 

there has been ONE week that I worked 36 hours in my entire time being there, I did multiple opens, and I made the same as I did at my previous full time job, and that only happened bc the manager was sick and I covered shifts, came in early, and stayed late. my paycheck this week was $280 as opposed to the $600 I was making at my other job/made that one week. I genuinely am starting to believe that the schedule is shitty on purpose but I know I'm not the only one getting screwed over because the manager (she is also new and only started over the summer) continuously schedules people for days they're not available and ignores 2+ week advance time off requests (that's why I get to cover as many shifts as I do.) I partly think it's on purpose bc I don't believe the manager likes me and a couple other people at all because we correct her on things that she's doing wrong like when she's broken our equipment or damaged the tools and messed up orders and prepped things incorrectly and I think she feels threatened by every single person in the shop who has more experience in this line of work than she does and I also think that's why she treats the new hires (they are awesome people I have nothing against them whatsoever) better than she treats any of the existing staff and I know for a fact that she's looking for any excuse to fire one of our employees who is awesome and great at her job but does not hesitate to point out when the manager is wrong. so I absolutely am starting to think that the manager is not stupid but she schedules people like shit on purpose, especially taking into consideration the fact that she schedules herself for prime optimal money making hours for 40+ hrs and then rides the clock and splits the tips with the baristas who are actually doing the work.

I feel so depressed i cannot afford to continue to go to the hospital. I cannot afford to miss work. Before my surgery i had a terrible time drinking liquids and i still do, i never feel thirsty . I always make sure to have water near me or something else to drink but it takes me forever to finish them. Unless i gulp them down all at once it will take me hours to finish one gatorade. Everyone mentions to just sip frequently but frankly I don’t get anywhere with just sipping.

In 10 years, the XDC Network has become the backbone of a decentralized global trade finance ecosystem, empowering small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to access capital and streamline cross-border trade processes. Here’s how it plays out in daily use:

Scenario: SME Trade Facilitation

1. Instant Financing for SMEs:
An SME in Kenya exports organic coffee beans to Germany. Traditionally, trade finance processes are slow and riddled with intermediaries. Using the XDC Network, the SME tokenizes its invoice into a digital asset, leveraging real-world asset (RWA) tokenization.
	•	The SME receives funding instantly by selling the invoice tokens to liquidity providers on the XDC-powered platform.
	•	Smart contracts automate the settlement process, ensuring that funds are distributed upon delivery milestones.

2. Transparency and Compliance:
The entire transaction is recorded immutably on the XDC blockchain. Trade documents like letters of credit and shipping manifests are verified using decentralized identity solutions, reducing fraud and ensuring compliance with international trade regulations.

3. Affordable Transaction Costs:
XDC’s hybrid architecture allows for near-zero transaction fees and lightning-fast processing. This is critical for SMEs, as traditional systems involve high costs and delays due to intermediary banks.

4. Institutional Integration:
Major financial institutions, leveraging XDC’s Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus mechanism, use the network for interoperability between CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies). This seamless integration eliminates currency exchange risks for cross-border payments.

5. Broader Market Access:
Tokenized trade assets on the XDC Network are listed in decentralized marketplaces, attracting global investors who can buy fractional ownership in trade receivables. This democratizes access to capital for SMEs and diversifies investment opportunities for participants.

Outcome:

The SME receives financing in minutes instead of weeks, enabling them to scale operations and compete in the global market. Investors benefit from high-yield, secure RWA investments. Governments and regulators trust the system for its compliance and transparency features.

Why It’s the Best Investment:

By 2035, the XDC Network dominates the $20 trillion trade finance market, leveraging its unique position as a scalable, efficient, and regulatory-friendly blockchain. Its adoption drives consistent demand for XDC tokens, securing its value and utility as a critical part of the global financial system.",1,1735889872.0,xinfin,0,1.0,False

1hsh3sv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1hsh3sv/my_mom_freaks_out_if_i_dont_respond_to_her_texts/,My mom freaks out if I don't respond to her texts immediately and I don't know how to get her to not,"TLDR; my mom gets really anxious if i don't respond to her immediately, even though if i don't get back to her it's not because i'm ignoring her but rather because i'm busy. i've talked to her about this situation a lot but there seems to be no progress. i don't know if there's something i'm doing wrong and i want to make sure that there isn't something really stupid that i'm doing that i can't see.

So I'm really frustrated and I want to rant about this but I don't want to bother anyone more than I already have. I also wanted to get an objective opinion because I think I'm too resentful of my mother to see the situation clearly.

I (20F) hung out with a friend (19M) that I haven't seen in a while. We both go to the same college and went to the same high school, but because of finals we hadn't caught up in over a month. We went to a coffee shop and then got some dinner, and afterwards he told me he wouldn't mind hanging out a bit more so we went to a park about 5 minutes away from my house.

Now, not only is this park 5 minutes away from my house, it's also well lit and very populated. High schoolers hang out at that park until very late at night cause it's just a hang out place for the popular kids in like athletics and cheerleading and shit. Basically, what I'm trying to say is that I was safe and my mom (46F) knew I was being safe (she has my location on Life360).

Me and my friend decided to hop on the swing set and for an hour we were just swinging and talking like we were little kids again. I had my phone in my back pocket but it was like poking my ass lmao so I took it out and put my phone face down on the tanbark (this is important for context).

Basically, while I had my phone on the floor, my mom was texting me a shit ton. She asked me when I was going to be home, and when I didn't respond within 20 minutes, she blew up my phone. She kept asking me if I was okay and told me she was getting anxious. She told me if I didn't respond then she'd send my dad to the park. She then called me twice.

I picked up my phone about 5 minutes after she called me because me and my friend just happened to get bored of the swings around that time. I immediately called my mom when I saw that she texted me and called me so much. I told her honestly what was going on, and she just started crying. She said ""why do you keep doing this to me"" and I reminded her calmly that I was not ignoring her and I wasn't unsafe. She then said ""I won't sleep till you're home and your father is also upset."" I then apologized for not being able to be on my phone but again reminded her that while the situation was unfortunate, I truly didn't mean to ignore her.

She cried for a few seconds and then said ""How could you do this to me?"" Now, this comes with the implication that I ignored her on purpose. I didn't. I don't go on my phone when I'm hanging out with people because it's rude. My phone was on the fucking floor. It was face down. I just didn't fucking see anything.

It was a complicated situation where if I expressed my frustration, then I'd be the bad guy because she's crying. I just told her I'd drop my friend off at his house and then come back home.

This isn't the first time my mother goes beserk if I don't respond immediately. One time I didn't respond to her texts for 2 hours. I was taking a fucking nap in my college apartment- that's why I couldn't respond. She called my ex to check in on me, and I woke up to him calling me because he thought i was in trouble. It was a whole mess for me to clean up, and this is just one incident out of the last 3 years I've been in college.

I've had multiple conversations with her where i've told her I feel she has an emotional dependency on me that is concerning now because I'm 20 and I need to have some independence and autonomy. She knows this upsets me. I had sympathy for her 2 years ago, when this was a relatively new problem. Hell, I had sympathy for her even a few months ago. But now? I don't have it in me to be sympathetic. I feel like I've communicated with her, and that's all I can do. She's my mother- I can't fix her anxiety for her. But her anxiety is so heavily fixated on me that it becomes my problem.

I don't know what to do about it. I'm really very deeply upset. I feel powerless. I'm upset that I can't go back to my college campus until about 2 weeks when winter break ends- I don't know how I'm going to deal with this if I'm honest. She always guilts me out of taking action. She'll say ""you don't know what it's like to be a parent, you're my only daughter and first child, this is difficult for me."" I feel like she doesn't hear how difficult it is for me. I get a lot of anxiety when I'm not in control of things, and it's something I've worked on by being grateful for what I am in control of (things like what I choose to spend my time on, etc.).

I feel like by her actively choosing to not work on her anxiety surrounding me, she accidentally takes away my control over my time, and that's something that makes me nervous. The difference between me and her is when these situations give me anxiety, I deal with it on my own. I feel responsible for my mother's emotions.

I don't know if I'm blowing this out of proportion. I'm not a parent, so I can't understand parental anxiety. I also can see how me not responding gave her anxiety. That's kind of why I wanted to post on here because I am aware I might be blinded by my frustration, or maybe I'm too close to the problem to see what I'm doing wrong. If anyone has any advice or general comments, that would be amazing, because I feel so hopeless in this situation.",1,1735889633.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

Hey everyone.

I 35(m) finally made it to my first ever meeting, although it was a speaker meeting, I still did it.

  
A little backstory. I kind of ruined christmas by showing up already hammered out of my mind and just being rude to everyone. It wasnt until the next day that I realized that I needed to stop saying im going to do it and just fucking do it.

Where im located (CAN), some citys have long waits for beds for detox so when i called to get into one i was put on the waitlist and told to call every morning to see if if there is a bed available. So of course to stop myself from going through withdrawls i kept drinking.

I called the next day and there were no beds, so again, i kept drinking.

and again. so that night I was on my second bottle when I vomitted what i thought was blood, so immediately I start to worry, but having been through all of the mental health and medical hotlines ive been talking to throughout the times between drinking and waiting for a bed i was told about coffee grains or black coloured vomit.

and since I knew family and friends werent really in a helping mood, i did what i thought i had to. I *called 911.* I tell the operator everything and tell her what im wearing while waiting outside of my place in order for them to find me, and they were there in about 90 seconds.

i go through everything with them while trying to be as kind and coherrant as possible. and we head to the emerengcy department, where i was observed overnight.

the next day, the SW on site has secured me a bed for detox, i just have to be at the center be 1000 for intake. i have absolutely nothing except for what i showed up in, so they were kind enought to find me some clothes and toiletries and give a voucher for a cab to the facility.

I get in and do triage and get my room (and some very helpful drugs) and start to aquaint myself to this place where were locked in with no cellphone to talk to the outside world. 

and you guys, let me tell you, **it was the greatest experience of my life going through that!** This was the first time ive gone through detox, my first time going through withdrawls in a safe enviroment, and the first time ive done it with people going through the same thing i was going through. **THE NURSES WERE AMAZING.** I cannot emphazize that enough.

the staff was great, I got new medications (previously on venlifaxine and busprione), i got my referals for a treatment center ive been wanting to go to. and i made new friends, some who have lost their way momentarily like, lets call him, Jim who prior to this stint was 9 years sober and actively in AA, or Rose who has been there for the first time but just needed something to kickstart her road to recovery like me, and our game room guys, that although were having a tough time always making us laugh, participate in arguments, and share snacks and goodies.

So today I got discharged and went to the mess i call home. i immediately started cleaning up and trying to get at least my place as it was before the drunken bender i was on. Feeling pretty emotional as i live alone i started to cry, clean, and cry.

Thats when i found it, the half bottle of vodka i had stashed. Thats when i really started bawling my eyes out. thats when i was about to give in. and then this anger inside me just took over and i grabbed it and i dumped it down the drain. that was **the hardest thing** ive had to do up to this point in my recovery.

thats when it hit me, if i can do that, i can go to a meeting. so i looked up meeting places and times in my city. there was one close to where i get my haircut, so i made my plan. im going for a haircut and im going to go to this meeting, im going to do my first ever meeting, just like calling 911, just like calling the detox centers, just like going through triage, just like taking my first step, im taking the next one.

I got into the cab, i went to my barber and had a lovely chat, and started walking over to the meeting spot, thats when the anxiety kicked in, the closer i got, the worse it got. but i carried on. and when i finally got to the outside i started to openly cry. i started to regret being there, i started having doubts, i started to shake, i started to wonder if i should even go it. but i did. (btw writing that last paragraph i was feeling all of those feelings again and am shaking right now)

but guys, **THIS WAS THE NEXT BEST THING I DID IN MY LIFE.**

not knowing where to go, i just began looking around for the AA room. still shaking from anxiety and man came over and asked ""can i help you buddy"" and i told him why i was there while tearing up, he told me his name and asked for mine and through the tears and being unable to speak i said ""im Exavn22"" and told me hes running the CMA and im welcome to join, they follow the Big Book too, but i just stayed outside of their room. before he left he said ""dont worry dude, youre in the right place, lets get you a coffee""

before i could even get it i broke down. its like the last 20 years of silencing my mind with drinking was coming out and some people came by to comfort me. ive never felt so loved in my life.

i stayed and waited for our group to start and listened to a man in his 60s tell stories about every one of the 12 steps. and as hes saying them i can see myself in those stories, in those shoes. i cried some more during it. 

afterwards i thanked the guys and the speaker, we talked for a bit and asked if i have a book. i told him i didnt, so he said lets go to my car and ill get you my extra one.

he gave me a ride home, no judgement, no lectures, just encouragement to keep going. 

i would now like to say that i am the proud owner of a Big Book, a person that attened their first meeting, and someone who has made it this far, tomorrow is day 7, and im going to be damn proud of that number.

  
thank you for listening guys

The others, oh boy. Cringy and cliched and overrated… I don’t want to downplay it for everybody else who loves them, so I won’t mention them by name, that’s not what this post is about.

They live close to Miami so we were going to go out New Years Eve to a popular club and stay with my parents. Leading up to the trip, I got very sick-- we're talking stomach bug and flu at the same time. I let her know the trip may be off if I didn't feel better. She was understanding and said that if we were to go, we could have a chill trip, spend time by the pool/beach and just relax. I felt guilty because her New Years plans were dependent on me and I was praying I would feel better in time. The morning of the flight I felt better, called her and said I would still want a more chill trip after my body had been through hell and back, and that the trip was on. Additionally, she almost missed the flight, while I was at the airport two hours early.

My parents have been so hospitable. They have made us dinner, have had funny conversations with us, drove us for a night out on the town so we didn't have to Uber, and even lent us their car to use for the few days we're here. I usually wake up before my friend, make coffee and tea for everyone, read a book and wait for her to wake up. We're only here for 4 days. We have made breakfast at home twice and ate breakfast out once. When we're at home, its a mix of spending time the two of us and spending time with my family. When we go out for activities (which we do every day), we both spend an equally long time getting ready. 

Today, while I was driving to Miami she said, ""If I knew you wanted to spend time with your family, I probably wouldn't have come."" I am in actual shock. She said when she travels, she prefers to do more activities and she feels when we leave the house at 2PM after eating breakfast, relaxing, and getting ready, we waste our days away. We are staying with my parents, so naturally I also talk to them while in the house. My friend is included in every conversation, and seemed(???) to be enjoying it.

This girl is one of my best friends. I thought our trip was nice. She was the one who suggested a more chill trip. I have been replaying the conversation multiple times in my head throughout the day. I even brought it up again because I could not wrap my head around it, and said I was not mad I just wanted to understand where she was coming from. She said she just felt like a guest and like she was dragging me along to activities. Meanwhile, I have been enjoying our days together. I told her that I wanted her to be comfortable staying with my family. I suggested that the next time we come to Florida, we get a hotel. I am trying to be understanding, but I can't help but to be upset about her comments.",1,1735889176.0,Vent,0,1.0,False

**Review of Paul Janka's ""Attraction Formula & Conversation Secrets: How To Seduce Any Woman In 60 Seconds""**

Are you struggling to meet women or start conversations with the ones you find interesting? You're not alone! So many guys out there face the same challenges. But what if I told you that there's a way to break through those barriers in just 60 seconds? Sounds crazy, right? Well, that's exactly what Paul Janka promises with his course, *Attraction Formula & Conversation Secrets: How To Seduce Any Woman In 60 Seconds*. Let’s take a closer look.

# Who is Paul Janka and Why Should You Trust Him?

Paul Janka is a well-known figure in the dating and attraction niche, and for good reason. He's been in the game for years and has developed a reputation for helping guys become more confident with women. His approach isn’t about tricks or manipulation; it's all about learning how to be your authentic self. He’s lived through the struggles that you may be facing now, and he’s dedicated to showing you how to overcome them.

With *Attraction Formula & Conversation Secrets*, Janka gives you the tools to approach women confidently without all the inner doubts that hold most guys back. Whether you’re looking to improve your conversation skills or learn how to approach women in any setting, Janka's course has you covered.

# What Does the Course Teach You?

This isn’t just a theory-based course. It’s a practical, real-world guide to getting better with women. Paul’s main philosophy is that the major obstacle for most men is their own self-doubt. The course helps you get past this by showing you how to approach women naturally, without thinking too much.

One of the standout features of *Attraction Formula & Conversation Secrets* is its simplicity. You don't need a fancy pick-up artist script or some complex set of rules. Paul emphasizes being yourself, which is key. The course goes step-by-step through proven methods for initiating conversations, keeping them interesting, and making a memorable impact within 60 seconds. It’s all about understanding the dynamics of attraction and adjusting your approach.

# Where Can You Apply These Techniques?

The beauty of this course is that you can apply it in nearly any social situation: whether you're out at a bar, in a coffee shop, or even at a networking event. The strategies Paul teaches are adaptable and can help you start conversations and build rapport wherever you are.

It’s not just about picking up women at clubs. The techniques in *Attraction Formula & Conversation Secrets* work just as well in casual, everyday encounters.

# When Should You Expect Results?

So, how soon will you see results? Well, it depends on how quickly you put the lessons into practice. According to Paul, you can start noticing a difference in your interactions almost immediately after applying the techniques. But, like anything, consistency is key. The more you practice and integrate the principles into your daily life, the better you’ll get. In short, Paul’s course is designed to give you fast results, but long-term success requires continued effort.

# Why Does It Work?

The reason this course works is because it addresses one of the biggest barriers men face: self-limiting beliefs. Too many men think they need to be someone else to attract women, but that’s simply not true. The course teaches you how to recognize and push past those mental blocks, empowering you to approach women confidently. By just being yourself, you make a real connection, and that’s what truly draws attraction.

# How Do You Get Started?

Ready to make a change? Getting started with *Attraction Formula & Conversation Secrets* is simple. You can buy the course directly from Paul Janka’s website, and once you’ve got access, you can dive straight into the lessons. The best part is that it’s all laid out for you in an easy-to-follow format, so you won’t feel overwhelmed or lost. Whether you’re a complete beginner or just looking to improve your existing skills, Paul’s approach will give you the foundation you need.

I'm an Asian currently settling in London. It's been quite lonely recently and haven't found much luck with dating apps. Trying it out here, cos who knows if what l'm looking for is here on reddit.
I have a full-time job on weekdays and maybe quite busy by then. But I respond fast to texts so that wouldn't be a problem. Know that I have lots of time to spare on weekends and maybe we can go out and have fun - visiting random places, having a good meal, and chatting over some drinks (though I prefer ol' fashioned coffee dates than the alcoholic ones).
If there's one thing l'm pretty much excited about, it must be cooking for you at my flat. Then we get to watch movies together and enjoy our time with each other.

I love taking pictures. Once we get to know each other well, I'll show you my IG full of wonderful photos from the places I've visited. Hopefully, when we're together, my albums will also be filled by wonderful photos of our adventures around the world (Europe first, then somewhere else).
I prefer someone also from here in London. So I can be with you regularly and we can spend quality time. I'm not sure if I can do long distance again since I have trust issues coming from the past. But let's see if it'll work.

I'm just a simple guy, not very hard to please. If you've reached this part and you're game with everything, maybe you can send me a message and let's see where it goes?

Just in case you're wondering, I prefer a top, masc guy.

If you’ve ever lived in or visited a tourist town, you’d know Christmas and New Year’s are absolutely insane for local businesses. It’s all hands on deck with long waits, massive orders, and people everywhere.

I live in one of these towns and work as a barista in a local, family-owned café. Most of the people who come in are pretty nice—patient, understanding, and chill. But then there’s that group. You know the ones. The impatient, entitled, C-you-next-Tuesday types.

Look, I get it. Waiting 30 minutes for food or 15 minutes for tea might seem ridiculous to you. Hell, even 5 minutes can feel long if you’re in a rush. But when the café is so busy that my coffee machine is covered in cups and dockets, and the next bench is piled high too, things are gonna take time.

Here’s why I’m saying this: the other day, after working 6 a.m. to 5-6 p.m. every day with no breaks and no days off, I had someone lose it because I wouldn’t push their tea ahead of everyone else’s drinks. Even though they said, “It’s just water in a cup.” When I explained that other people had ordered before them, they told me to “stop being such a f$#k wit.”

Do you know how hard it was not to say something back? Instead, I just told them to leave.

So please, for the love of God, don’t be that person. We’re all doing our best out here. Be patient. Be kind. And don’t take your frustration out on the people working their butts off to serve you.",441,1735888199.0,australia,83,0.95,False

Suddenly, I hear this loud banging noise outside, like someone’s trying to break into something. Naturally, my inner nosy neighbor kicks in, and I peek out the window.

There’s this guy struggling with his car hood in the middle of the street. Smoke is pouring out, and he’s waving his arms like he’s trying to land a plane. I figure I should at least see if he’s okay, so I grab my shoes and head out.

Turns out, his car decided to overheat in the most dramatic way possible. He’s panicking because he’s late for work and has no idea what to do. Now, I’m no mechanic, but I know enough to suggest he let the engine cool down and maybe check the coolant.

But here’s where it gets wild—while we’re dealing with his car, his dog (who was sitting in the passenger seat) decides to make a run for it. This dog, I kid you not, takes off like it’s auditioning for the next Fast & Furious movie.

Without even thinking, I start chasing after the dog. It’s zig-zagging through yards, dodging sprinklers, and I’m just out here, running like my life depends on it. Eventually, it slows down, probably realizing it has no idea where it’s going, and I manage to grab its leash.

When I get back, the guy is still dealing with his car, but now there’s a small group of neighbors gathered around, offering advice and tools. We all work together to get him sorted out, and by the end of it, the guy’s car is running, his dog is safe, and I’ve apparently earned the title of “Neighborhood MVP.”

It wasn’t exactly how I planned to spend my morning, but honestly? It felt good to help out and see everyone come together like that.",3,1735887964.0,story,0,1.0,False

I don't know if this is a very repeated question asked in the sub, but I've been lurking around for ages and have had the pleasure of ordering and trying some coffees that I found on this sub. 

I'm listing some of the coffees I've tried and loved in the past year, based on that it would be great if you guys could suggest something for me. 

*Important information - I use an Aeropress to brew my coffee and have to get them pre-ground because I don't own a grinder yet, I'm looking at the C3 and saving my money to get that whenever I can lay my hands on it so please don't hate on me yet.*

* Banana Kents (Light-Med) from Half Light Coffee - *Tasting Notes - Jaggery Bites, Plum, Cocoa*. Really loved it because it was really distinctive for my palette. (630/- 250g)

* Project Pearl, Ratnagiri Estate, Karnataka - Process Anaerobic Naturals (Med) from Subko - *Tasting Notes - Elderflower, Blackberry, Caramel.* It had a very nice floral note that was sort of relaxing every time I took a sip. It was the most I spent on a pack of coffee and while it wasn't bad, the price hurt my pocket. (795+150 shipping :')/- 250g)

* Salawara Lot #1452 (Med) from Half Light Coffee - *Tasting Notes -* *Jamun, Crisp Apple, Clove.* This coffee had a very delicious sour acidic taste and I had to make up my mind before drinking it. Pretty bold, definitely different from the above two, nothing to hate about it. (600/- 250g)

* Hidden Falls Estate  - Process Naturals (Light) from Blue Tokai - *Tasting Notes - Mango, Mulberry, Guava*. Having this rn as I'm writing this post, it took its fair share of days to grow on me and well it's nice but I was expecting something different from this particular pack. (680/- 250g)

* Melkodige Lot 28 - Process Cima Yeast Incolculated Naturals (Light) from Rossette Coffee Labs - *Tasting Notes - Strawberry, Cherry Cola, Port Wine.* Worth mentioning, the tasting notes exactly describe how this coffee tasted. A strong taste of Cola which well, I didn't have an attachment to but it's definitely worth a mention. (700/- 250g) \\

Apart from this I've tried my fair share of Chocolaty and Bold and Bitter ones from Blue Tokai and have found out that **I search for fruitiness in my coffee rather than the chocolates or the kick**. No hate to those, I have them whenever I visit my girlfriend xD.

Also, another thing that I wanted to ask was do I need to wait for my pre-ground coffee to degas before brewing them or it doesn't matter since I'm unable to grind them fresh every day. *Secondly, I'm located in Delhi NCR if anyone's selling a grinder at a fair price shoot me a dm.*

Anyway, that was all the information I thought I could provide. Please provide me with some options to try and feel free to ask anything else that can be taken into account.",1,1735887442.0,IndiaCoffee,2,1.0,False

I didn’t get sick driving over yay :) 

I had a nice brunch with mum before! The place was kind of American feeling, like it was a brunch serving bar/restaurant not a cafe and we were there at midday so some people were drinking and anyway there were TVs and projectors around because it was presumably the kinda place people go to watch the rugby and all that. The food wasn’t that great but it was nice and the coffee was delish, I had a flat white and eggs florentine and I swapped a lil rosti for some of mums jackfruit. I really like jackfruit, I always forget about it. Anyway so that was nice and the staff were lovely. I need to stop finding not awkward things awkward, awkward isn’t the right word but… uncomfy? But like when I was paying as I paid for it all for mum and anyway I was paying and the waiter man kept asking questions and chatting and so I was chatting back but like when am I allowed to say okay thanks bye because I did that and he kept asking stuff. Like I want to go home now please. But it’s also nice, I really like when people talk to me as it makes me feel idk, seen I guess. It’s just 95% of me wishes I was invisible yknow. 

I got my brows done too and they turned out fairly well I think. Yay. No lashes, I think I said that yesterday. I don’t need my lashes done anyway, it’s just I think they’re prettier when they’re done. It’s more of a holiday thing I suppose, like if I go swimming or don’t wear any makeup I still look a bit more put together. When I go to visit Andy I’ll get them done then, then again I will get everything done for that trip won’t I - hair, manicure, pedicure, brows, lashes… that’s about it really. Regular stuff I do throughout the year but I’d want it to be all nice and fresh. Anyway. I also got some lip balm and a moisturiser and a hair mask while I was in town. 

He thought I was doing bad things instead of just with mum :( In fairness I see why he thought that after the bedding comment, I didn’t even think of that, I was purely just telling him about my day and what I was doing and idk. I didn’t mean to worry him and I still feel bad about it now. I just share all the mundane details of my days with him so it was just that sort of chat. Anyway I washed my bedding and hung it to dry so when I come home I can put fresh bedding on my bed! I love fresh sheets so much. Anyway it’s a bit funny, not *funny* but how he thinks I’m probably off with some other guy when in reality on the drive home - after a day with my mother - I’m listening to truly madly deeply and day dreaming about dancing with him to it and marrying him. Like baby no - I am not cheating I am becoming internally delirious about the idea of marrying my best friend and the love of my life, aka you? But I do understand his worries, I still have them too, and I have less reason to suspect anything I suppose. I just feel bad I made him uneasy. Anyway. 

It’s the last proper day off til back to work :( I mean I have the next two days but they’re a weekend yknow. Booooooooooooooooooo. I should book in for some time in February, then again idk if I’ll be able to given the workload that’ll be hitting us. Hm. Well I’ll take more time off soon anyway. 

Mum is *just* like grandma, aka her mum, so that tracks. I wonder if I have a daughter I’ll be the same? Anyway I just put my hair up in a tighter, higher bun than normal and she keeps saying “oh look how beautiful / look at my gorgeous girl / you should really wear your hair like that more it lets us see your lovely face” and it’s nice and all but it makes me SO awkward!! I really don’t like compliments. No. I do like them, I just don’t like receiving them. Also it felt so stupid because it wasn’t a nice hairstyle at all, it was yanked up with no mirror because I was playing with pups and it was getting in the way. Anyway grandma would say it allllllllll the time telling me to get my hair out of my face but like excuse me grandma it’s 2007 and I have a sweeping emo fringe that I need to show off? Let me live? It was not cute, to be fair. Retrospect and all that. I also had a full fringe at one point but I looked like a panda. But I’m less angsty teen emo now and more… well idk but not that, so maybe I could pull off a fringe of some kind again? Or are my cheeks to cheeky? That’s my concern. Will I lose my face and become half fringe half cheek? Hm. They’re not even that chipmunky really but they feel it. Anyway. My skins been a lot better since stopping micellar, I wonder if that actually caused some issues/redness? Hm. Anyway.

Couple of family were joking that they should charge for parking or storage, get a coffee machine, bake cakes or have cold drinks available. Stuff that won't need big investment. They will probably check the parking option.

1hsgixx,https://www.reddit.com/r/letters/comments/1hsgixx/choo_choo/,Choo Choo,"When I ask him why I am deeply saddened by his absence he says
“You’re in love”
“I love you, baby. Just like that, too.” 

And his voice sounds like the resonance of a church choir finishing a hymn about life and death. About the prosperous and the unfortunate. I kneel to pray, but at his feet. I am ravenous and a slave to his scent. I am intertwined in the way his back feels against my breasts when I hold him at night. I have never been brought to tears by the thought of a man, but they fall from my eyes like rain. He says my name and it pours out in buttery soft sounds as if he knows that he can make love with his voice; a spell that has wrapped me so tightly I can’t surrender to thoughtful action. 

I lift my shirt to reveal my breasts to him. Most times he lifts his shirt to touch his chest to mine. He has the most incredible hair on his chest; I adore my face pressed into him. I fear that my intensity of love for him is due to my feeling of him leaving me, for another. I am going to be 37 soon, he is 51. I know that the age gap might seem great, but I am blind to it now. When I first met him in person it was obvious, but now, I feel ancient with him. We’ve known each other before in another life. 

This is what I tell myself, this is the blanket my heart weaves that keeps me warm at night when I’m not with him. 
 
I’d tell you here and now that I know a lot about obsession and a hearts deep yearning. I’ve been to this familiar ground many times before... and I’ll likely be here again until some underpaid asshole shovels dirt on my expensive box.

You must think “How do you know that you love him?” 
All I know about this love is the tie that happened during intimacy. May as well have strapped a concrete block to my feet and pushed me into the Chicago River. Make it green like St. Patty’s Day. Green like envy. Green like yeast infections and money. For some time, I held interest in tarot and the metaphysical. I threw all my decks out and cursed the day I’d ever get my hands on one again. I had fallen into a spell of bad luck. No pun intended.  But I watch it on YouTube, because I’m a hypocrite. 

Hours upon hours upon hours of zodiac sign monthly pulls. 

“Wow! You won’t believe this Aquarius!” January 2025 Tarot - and the bitch of it is that there are people, me included, who believed and still do believe that it’s true. I watch them and wait for confirmation of what I want to hear. You guessed it, love. I want to hear about love. If I don’t resonate at all – well – I click off until I find something that speaks to what I want. 

If they even so much as mutter the sign of the man that I’m pining over – I watch diligently until my eyes burn from the screen. Countless thieves roam the internet waiting for pathetic people like me to fall for their droll and sweep themselves away into paying for a personal reading. They collect on the pain sad people feel. 

News flash. 
We are all sad. 

When I was a young girl, my father always told me to “shut the fuck up and stop whining”; it didn’t do anything for me other than make me sorry. To everyone and everything. Sorry for reacting appropriately, sorry when I don’t. Sorry when it has nothing to do with me at all. Sorry for sharing the same air in the same room on the same planet. Well, I’m an adult now and so much of that life is gone. I cut ties with the only relatives I have left recently, and I feel no sorrow. Nothing. Not a shrivel of a tear. I’ve cried them all. Sadness has become me and is no longer a feeling that could touch me like kissing cousins on a prepubescent hunt.

I was married for 13 years before I announced I to the father of my children that divorce was imminent, and I didn’t feel a single thing other than relief; call me cold-hearted. I was tired of living a lie. I had been lying to myself mostly. 

The challenge for me now is that I am bombarded with debt. Financial, emotional, physical debt. I owe everyone something and I can’t get my bearings on any of it. From Lawyers to work to my apartment and my kids – I’m a damn mess. I spoke with my therapist about ditching my parents and the guilt I feel with it; she says they are toxic people. 

They are without a doubt toxic people.

My Fathers birthday just passed like a freighter– and I looked back for a moment in recollection of the fear I had harnessed as a little girl not knowing if her mother was coming back. I was dropped off and told by my mother:

“It’s just for a couple of weeks Mandy. I’ll be back before you know it.” 

Choo – Choo. 
She sang
“Mama comes back, she always comes back” in her sing song voice with her wretched stink breath and I knew then that I’d likely not see her for a long time. 

Choo – Choo. 

She lost custody of my sister and I after her then boyfriend – turned husband several years later – beat the shit out of me for slamming the front door of the house as we ran in and out over and over and over 

Choo – Choo.
Playing outside with our friends. I was in first grade.
I remember the sting of the slotted spoon and the sound of the scream from out of my mouth like I had been struck by a million buzzing bees. He wet the spoon before he beat me black and blue to make sure he flew the point straight home. 

Funny, only his anger landed.
Funny, only realizing later in life that I am the train.

I had to attend school the following morning, I showed the girl that lived next door to me what happened. Barbara was her name. My mother entrusted her to walk me sometimes in the morning.

Unbuttoning my pants and pulling them down to reveal my black and purple legs she took me to high school instead. I was interviewed by the nurse and taken from my mother and placed under my father’s care. He was a better option by far, don’t get me wrong. I am grateful that he did, but I didn’t like him. He was mean and didn’t carry an ounce of warmth in him that my little breaking heart needed. He wasn’t kind or compassionate to me - even then as a small broken girl.

My aunt told me when I was a bit older that I used to call him 
“Icky Black Face” because he worked on a dock and was dirty all of the time. 
As I type this, I feel the guilt for my words – but I’m cloaked in outrage for a life that wasn’t for me. I couldn’t have what other people had. 

The welcome I got to his house when he took custody was a shitty handmade mobile hanging off the ceiling fan. He got his just desserts when I pissed the bed nearly every night out of fear. I was reeling still from the pain of my mother leaving and the physical/sexual abuse I had endured while under her care. The same man who beat me to a bloody pulp also touched my little body as much as he wanted – my own mother bearing witness. 

My father would wrap me in my blanket in the middle of the night so I wasn’t cold and wouldn’t feel the urine seeping through the sheets I just soiled. Night after night like clockwork I’d wake up to the damp cold until the damp cold became me.

You know, through the years I have heard in order to be a writer you need to read. I don’t read, though I try. Day to day I have many things going on – so many that if I sat down to read, I’d have time for nothing else. I live in the Midwest and it is winter. I should be hunkered down and cozy in this beautiful couch that my boyfriend got me snuggled up with a book; or should I really? I’d rather fight the middle-aged woman norms and instead pace around the floor staring at everything I need to do 

Laundry? 
“Fuck you” I say to the pile staring at me in the corner. 

Scrub the bathroom? 
“Soap scum thicker than the walls of my pussy” I say staring into my face in the mirror, shocked at my own audacity.

Breakthroughs – not breakdowns! Progress doesn’t equal perfection. Fuck the police coming straight from the underground. 
And on and on are the nonsense thoughts swirling around a manic brain full of bloody kneed heartache.

I do all the cleaning simultaneously so that none of it actually gets completed to its potential. I have been counting the days until the warmth and the sun graces my back again, but it’s pained from being railed by the man who will be the death of me. He will be the death of me. 

It’s hard to believe that I have been in this new apartment for almost a month. It’s nothing to gaff at really, it’s tiny. It’s location leaves little to be desired but it’s not quite the worst parts of the city. I am dreaming of a Lake Michigan home somewhere near the Upper Peninsula in Michigan and wishing on every star that one day my dream will turn into a reality. I want to wake up to the sound of the wind sending waves crashing to the shore. I want to have my coffee on a humid morning staring out into the expanse of blue green heaven. I want to smell the fishy air and stick my tongue out as far as it can go so the falling rain drops aren’t jealous of my own squinty eyed anticipation. I close them and wait for the burst to come, and when it does I have to stop myself from gagging.

I can’t figure out sometimes if he’s coming or going. 

In reality, 
I want to build a web and stay in it.
I want to spin and spin and spin until I can catch anything I want. I want to continue to lie to myself and say that I’ll write the book someday and maybe someone who is anyone will read it and think I’m not a wasted humanoid taking up space. 

I am only a moment away from spontaneous combustion.

1hsghsg,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1hsghsg/my_mom_worries_about_me_20f_when_im_out_of_the/,My mom worries about me (20F) when I'm out of the house and I hate it and think it's excessive,"TLDR; my mom gets really anxious if i don't respond to her immediately, even though if i don't get back to her it's not because i'm ignoring her but rather because i'm busy. i've talked to her about this situation a lot but there seems to be no progress. i don't know if there's something i'm doing wrong and i want to make sure that there isn't something really stupid that i'm doing that i can't see.

So I'm really frustrated and I want to rant about this but I don't want to bother anyone more than I already have. I also wanted to get an objective opinion because I think I'm too resentful of my mother to see the situation clearly.

I (20F) hung out with a friend (19M) that I haven't seen in a while. We both go to the same college and went to the same high school, but because of finals we hadn't caught up in over a month. We went to a coffee shop and then got some dinner, and afterwards he told me he wouldn't mind hanging out a bit more so we went to a park about 5 minutes away from my house.

Now, not only is this park 5 minutes away from my house, it's also well lit and very populated. High schoolers hang out at that park until very late at night cause it's just a hang out place for the popular kids in like athletics and cheerleading and shit. Basically, what I'm trying to say is that I was safe and my mom (46F) knew I was being safe (she has my location on Life360).

Me and my friend decided to hop on the swing set and for an hour we were just swinging and talking like we were little kids again. I had my phone in my back pocket but it was like poking my ass lmao so I took it out and put my phone face down on the tanbark (this is important for context).

Basically, while I had my phone on the floor, my mom was texting me a shit ton. She asked me when I was going to be home, and when I didn't respond within 20 minutes, she blew up my phone. She kept asking me if I was okay and told me she was getting anxious. She told me if I didn't respond then she'd send my dad to the park. She then called me twice.

I picked up my phone about 5 minutes after she called me because me and my friend just happened to get bored of the swings around that time. I immediately called my mom when I saw that she texted me and called me so much. I told her honestly what was going on, and she just started crying. She said ""why do you keep doing this to me"" and I reminded her calmly that I was not ignoring her and I wasn't unsafe. She then said ""I won't sleep till you're home and your father is also upset."" I then apologized for not being able to be on my phone but again reminded her that while the situation was unfortunate, I truly didn't mean to ignore her.

She cried for a few seconds and then said ""How could you do this to me?"" Now, this comes with the implication that I ignored her on purpose. I didn't. I don't go on my phone when I'm hanging out with people because it's rude. My phone was on the fucking floor. It was face down. I just didn't fucking see anything.

It was a complicated situation where if I expressed my frustration, then I'd be the bad guy because she's crying. I just told her I'd drop my friend off at his house and then come back home.

This isn't the first time my mother goes beserk if I don't respond immediately. One time I didn't respond to her texts for 2 hours. I was taking a fucking nap in my college apartment- that's why I couldn't respond. She called my ex to check in on me, and I woke up to him calling me because he thought i was in trouble. It was a whole mess for me to clean up, and this is just one incident out of the last 3 years I've been in college.

I've had multiple conversations with her where i've told her I feel she has an emotional dependency on me that is concerning now because I'm 20 and I need to have some independence and autonomy. She knows this upsets me. I had sympathy for her 2 years ago, when this was a relatively new problem. Hell, I had sympathy for her even a few months ago. But now? I don't have it in me to be sympathetic. I feel like I've communicated with her, and that's all I can do. She's my mother- I can't fix her anxiety for her. But her anxiety is so heavily fixated on me that it becomes my problem.

I don't know what to do about it. I'm really very deeply upset. I feel powerless. I'm upset that I can't go back to my college campus until about 2 weeks when winter break ends- I don't know how I'm going to deal with this if I'm honest. She always guilts me out of taking action. She'll say ""you don't know what it's like to be a parent, you're my only daughter and first child, this is difficult for me."" I feel like she doesn't hear how difficult it is for me. I get a lot of anxiety when I'm not in control of things, and it's something I've worked on by being grateful for what I am in control of (things like what I choose to spend my time on, etc.).

I feel like by her actively choosing to not work on her anxiety surrounding me, she accidentally takes away my control over my time, and that's something that makes me nervous. The difference between me and her is when these situations give me anxiety, I deal with it on my own. I feel responsible for my mother's emotions.

I don't know if I'm blowing this out of proportion. I'm not a parent, so I can't understand parental anxiety. I also can see how  me not responding gave her anxiety. That's kind of why I wanted to post on here because I am aware I might be blinded by my frustration, or maybe I'm too close to the problem to see what I'm doing wrong. If anyone has any advice or general comments, that would be amazing, because I feel so hopeless in this situation.",2,1735887148.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

1hsgdbp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1hsgdbp/hard_mode_bingo_mini_reviews/,Hard Mode Bingo Mini Reviews,"These are mini reviews for everything I read that qualified for Bingo. It was my 2024 New Years resolution to read more and to take part in the Fantasy Bingo. I totally didn’t do it right earlier this year, as I didn’t even realize you were only supposed to use an author once. Oops. So, in a way this is my actual first bingo. My goal is to get the full square on Hard Mode, and I would like to do the same for Normal Mode too, but we will see. Here is my card so far for my Hard Mode bingo. 

First Row Across: 

**First in a Series:** *Before The Coffee Gets Cold* by Toshikazu Kawaguchi: 4/5   
The premise is that at a small cafe in Tokyo, there is a way for a person to time travel if they have a coffee at a particular seat. Each chapter focuses on a different person and their reason for time traveling, so it kind of felt episodic, so the mileage varies chapter to chapter. Overall, I enjoyed the bittersweet nature, and I have already continued the series. Also qualifies for:  Multi-Pov (HM), Author of Color 

**Under The Surface:** *The Fireborne Blade* by Charlotte Bond: 4/5 

It takes place primarily in an underground den, following a knight trying to redeem her honor by slaying the dragon. On its face it is a simple story, but offers enough unique worldbuilding, intrigue, and twists and turns to elevate the premise. Definitely, an easy read. Also qualifies for: Prologue and Epilogue, Dreams (HM?), First in a Series 

Second Row Across 

**Entitled Animals:** *The Last Unicorn* by Peter S Beagle: 4/5 

Came in not knowing anything about this despite this being a classic, never saw the animated movie nor really ever heard of the book before. I absolutely adored how Peter S Beagle wrote this story, as it really reflected the fairytale nature of the story. The actual plot kind of ebbed and flowed in terms of my interest, but the prose kept me reading. 

**Prologues and Epilogues:** *Mistborn* by Brandon Sanderson: 5/5 

This has been on my TBR for years and finally started by Sanderson and Cosmere journey. It absolutely lived up the hype. I binge Well of Ascension and Hero of Ages quickly afterwords. The plan is to start the Stormlight Archive in 2025, after reading Elantris (the next book in my queue). Also qualifies for: Reference Materials (HM), Multi-POV, First in a Series (HM?) 

**Self-Published or Indie Publisher:** *The Warded Gunslinger* by Filip Wiltgren: 2/5 

Unfortunately, this never really hooked me in. An amalgamation of genres I like, such as Western, Fantasy, and Sci-fi, but it never felt like a cohesive world that I could sink my teeth into. Also qualifies for: Book club or Readalong Book 

Third Row Across: 

**Dark Academia:** *Ninth House* by Leigh Bardugo: 5/5 

Takes place at Yale, as Alex Stern tries to unravel a murder and other mysteries concerning the Secret Societies. I loved this book; I binge read this so fast. The pacing of the book is excellent, as the stakes keep getting raised as the mysteries deepen. I also read the sequel shortly after Hell Bent, while I didn’t think it was as good, but it was a solid sequel. Also qualifies for: Reference Material, Prologue and Epilogue, First in a Series 

**Multi-POV:** *Five Broken Blade*s by Mai Corland: 5/5 

Five killers/criminals are hired to steal the magical crown granting the king immortality. Written all in first POV, I thought all the different POV changes would make it confusing or hard to follow, but it didn’t. I thought the constant POV changes added to book, as we never see an omniscient view of things, we are kept in the dark allowing for twists and turns. Saw some discussion if this should have been nominated on Goodreads under Romantasy or Fantasy. I felt that despite each character having their own romance subplot, it never felt like it was the primary plot., in fact I didn’t even think about the romance aspect until way later. Also qualifies for: First in a Series, Alliterative Titles, Criminals (HM), Romantasy, Published in 2024 (HM), Author of Color (HM), Reference Materials 

**Published in 2024:** *Foul Days* by Genoveva Dimova: 2/5 

Another book, that never hooked me in despite my excitement to read this. I had to trudge through it to finish. I thought the relationship between the main protagonist and antagonist was really interesting and had something to say, but that was just a minor part of the book. Also qualifies for: Criminals, Survival (HM), First in a Series, Book club or Readalong Book 

**Published in the 1990s:** *Last Call* by Tim Powers: 3/5 

Scott is an alcoholic former professional poker player, that has to travel to Vegas to figure how to keep his body from being taken over by another person, after unknowingly losing in a game. I found the plot to be confusing and convoluted for large chunks of the book. It introduces many side characters that you have no idea what they are doing nor their goals or purpose in the plot until later in the book. That being said, it had enough good aspects that I was able to keep reading, and the book was able to wrap up nicely. Also qualifies for: Survival (HM) 

Fourth Row Across: 

**Survival:** *The Spellshop* by Sarah Beth Durst: 4/5 

Kiela, a librarian at the Capitol’s grand library that keeps all the knowledge of magic, by the way of spellbooks. As a rebellion starts to take over the Capitol, which threatens to destroy/burn down the library, Kiela escapes with as many books (particularly the illegal spellbook kind) as she could fit in her small boat. She travels back to her home island and starts over and tries to survive on her own. This is a cozy fantasy but has enough stakes to keep the pace and plot moving well. Also qualifies for: Set in a Small Town, Romantasy, Published in 2024 

**Judge a Book by Its Cover:** *Heavenbreaker* by Sara Wolf: 4/5 

The bastard daughter of a powerful duke seeks revenge by joining a tournament of jousting Mechs. Very anime coded. Like the not romance parts, but the romance I found uninteresting, as it was instant love/lust. The book’s cover is blue and gold with embossed picture of an eagle with sprayed edges.  Also qualifies for: Published in 2024 (HM), Multi-POV, Prologue and Epilogue, Romantasy 

Fifth Row Across: 

**Set in a Small Town:** *A House With Good Bones* by T Kingfisher: 3/5 

A woman comes to stay at her mother’s house and creepy and unsettling things start to happen. Lots of bug facts. Overall, I liked this creepy little book, though it went in a different direction than I thought it would. The third act got way out there, but it still was a satisfying conclusion.  

**Five SFF Short Stories:** *The Tanglewood Palace* by Marjorie Liu: 4/5 

A collection of seven short stories with my favorite being: *The Briar and the Rose*: A sapphic pseudo-reimaging of Sleeping Beauty. Marjorie Liu crafted an interesting fairytale in its own right. *After The Blood*: A post-apocalyptic vampire story set in an enclave of Amish farms. A neat little dark fantasy that I wouldn’t mind continuing. *The Tanglewood Palace*: Another fairytale story about a runaway princess escaping an arraigned marriage that turned into a nice romance. Also qualifies for: Author of Color 

**Eldritch Creatures:** *Asunder* by Kerstan Hall: 5/5 

Karys, is a deathspeaker, basically like a D&D warlock, locked in a contract with Sabaster and eldritch entity. Her latest job goes awry, and she has to figure out how to untangle herself from a mysterious stranger before he takes over her body or even worse before Sabaster calls in her contract taking her soul and body. Picked this up on a whim and wow this blew me away. This dark fantasy kept raising the stakes, at a non-stop pace with plenty of ticking clocks and twists and turns. Also qualifies for: Published in 2024, Survival (HM) 

**Reference Materials:** *The Priory of the Orange Tree* by Samantha Shannon: 5/5 

Overall, a great epic fantasy with several characters to root for and an intriguing plot. Featuring dragons and dragon riders, a secret cult of sorceresses, pirates what more can you ask for? Also qualifies for: Multi-POV 

**Book Club or Readalong Book:** *The Tainted Cup* by Robert Jackson Bennett: 5/5 

An excellent murder mystery plot in an interesting eldritch/kaiju infested world. Loved it. Cool and interesting world building and a good take on Holmes-Watson. Also qualifies for: Eldritch Creatures, Published in 2024, Reference Materials ",7,1735886671.0,Fantasy,0,1.0,False

One of my classmates is an acquaintance I’ve known since undergrad. We went to the same college and were paralegals in the same office building for three years before law school.

I was initially hesitant to date in law school but now that a new semester is approaching I’ve thought more and more about shooting my shot.

I’ve never dated in a school environment before. What’s the best way to ask her out? Should I begin with more casual 1-on-1s like coffee on campus or squash (we both play), or take her for dinner off campus? 

Also - I’m somewhat wary of getting caught up in the campus rumor mill, and not sure if I’m friendzoned by default since I’ve known her for a while (but only as an acquaintance). But alas, life is too short to think about these meaningless things, right? ",0,1735886595.0,LawSchool,10,0.48,False

They say crypto is a journey, not just a destination—and boy, does that apply to self-discovery. Somewhere between swapping tokens at 2 AM and holding through a bear market, you start asking: “Who am I?”

Here’s how crypto helps you unearth your true self:

1. The HODL Test of Patience:
Are you a Zen master who rides the storm with diamond hands? Or do you panic-sell the moment the market dips? Crypto shows you exactly how well you handle pressure. (Spoiler: most of us are paper-handed before coffee.)

2. The DAO Dilemma:
Joining a DAO isn’t just about governance—it’s about finding your tribe. Are you a tech nerd, a creative, or a meme lord? Crypto communities give you a stage to flex your skills and uncover your passions.

3. The Meme Mirror:
Your NFT collection says more about you than your zodiac sign. From Pudgy Penguins to pixelated punks, the art you vibe with reflects the inner you—quirky, nostalgic, or just downright chaotic.

4. The Risk Philosopher:
Crypto isn’t for the faint of heart. Are you a calculated strategist or an impulsive moon-chaser? Your trading style uncovers how you face uncertainty—and how far you’ll go chasing dreams.

5. The Decentralized Rebel:
Do you see crypto as financial freedom or just a fun way to make (and lose) money? Your stance on decentralization says a lot about your values. Are you a freedom fighter or just here for the vibes?

At the end of the day, crypto isn’t just about charts and coins—it’s about finding who you are in the process. So next time you’re deep in the blockchain trenches, take a moment to reflect. You might just discover the most valuable asset of all: you.

1hsgc4e,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_PimpBlimp5000/comments/1hsgc4e/what_is_your_new_years_resolution/,"What Is Your New Year’s Resolution?

","Every New Year’s Eve, millions of people gather around to reflect on the past year and make ambitious resolutions for the year ahead. With fireworks lighting up the sky, they vow to make transformative changes and promise to themselves that they’ll finally get life on track. But as the year unfolds, many of these resolutions fade into distant memories. Let’s follow the story of Alex and Lili, whose New Year’s resolutions embodied the typical struggles of modern life.

On January 1st, Alex and Lili woke up energized and determined. This year, they’d cut back on Netflix, spend less time gaming, and focus on learning skills that would elevate their lives. They were also determined to exercise regularly and improve their health. They scribbled these goals down in a brand-new journal titled “2025: My Best Year Yet.”

In the first week, they were unstoppable. The Netflix subscription was downgraded, and they promised themselves to stick to one episode a day or, better yet, none at all. They set aside their gaming console to read a self-help book about developing productive habits. They managed to hit the gym three times that week, posting sweaty selfies with captions like, “New year, new me.” Friends cheered them on, liking and commenting with heart emojis.

By the third week, the enthusiasm had begun towane. A new season of their favorite Netflix series was released, and the temptation to binge-watch was overwhelming. “Just one episode won’t hurt,” they told themselves, sinking into the couch. Five hours later, they were still there, surrounded by empty snack wrappers.

The gym? It was becoming a distant memory. The thought of getting dressed, driving there, and sweating it out seemed too much after a long day of work. “I’ll start again next week,” they rationalized.

By February, their resolutions had almost entirely unraveled. Netflix was back to autoplaying episodes late into the night. Gaming sessions had crept back into their daily routine, eating up hours that could have been spent on learning new skills. The books they had planned to read sat untouched on the coffee table, and the gym membership card remained unused in their wallet.

They felt a pang of guilt every time they remembered their ambitious list of resolutions. But guilt quickly gave way to excuses: “Life is stressful. I’ll get back on track when things calm down.”

Their story is not unique. Studies show that most New Year’s resolutions fail by mid-February. Why? Because change is hard. Breaking old habits requires discipline, and building new ones demands consistency. Resolutions often lack a realistic plan, measurable goals, and the flexibility to adapt to setbacks.

Alex and Lili's goal to “spend less time on Netflix” didn’t include specifics. How much less? And what would replace that time? Similarly, the vague commitment to “elevate life” through learning lacked a concrete plan for what to learn, how to learn it, and when to start.

If their story resonates with you, it’s not too late to make a change. Here are some steps to turn resolutions into lasting habits.

1. **Start Small and Be Specific**

Instead of saying, “Spend less on Netflix,” decide to cancel premium features and limit viewing to weekends only. For gaming, allocate specific days and set time limits.

**2. Replace, Don’t Remove**

If you want to watch less Netflix, plan activities to fill that time reading, taking a course, or going for a walk. The goal isn’t just to stop bad habits but to replace them with better ones.

**3. Set Measurable Goals**

Don’t aim to “learn things that elevate your life” without defining what those things are. Pick a specific skill, such as learning to code, playing an instrument, or mastering public speaking. Break it into smaller milestones, like dedicating 30 minutes a day to practice.

**4. Make Health a Priority**

Start small with physical activities you enjoy. A 10-minute daily walk is better than no exercise at all. Gradually increase the intensity or duration as it becomes a habit.

**5. Track Progress**

Keep a journal or use an app to monitor your achievements. Celebrate small wins to stay motivated. I personally use journals.

**6. Forgive Setbacks**

Falling off track doesn’t mean failure. Use it as an opportunity to reassess and restart.

New Year’s resolutions aren’t about perfection; they’re about progress. Alex and Lili’s experience is a reminder that meaningful change requires intention, planning, and persistence. The year is long, and every day is an opportunity to recommit to your goals. Whether it’s spending less on Netflix, playing fewer games, learning something new, or prioritizing health, the journey matters more than the destination.

So, as the months roll on, remember: It’s not about making perfect resolutions but about taking imperfect actions toward a better you. And if Alex and Lili can restart, so can you.

Sobrang busy sya sa college life ako naman sakto lang, I understand that naman, halos wala na syang oras sakin non but I keep on chatting goodmorning, goodnight, kumain ka na kahit wala syang response lagi kong iniisip na busy lang sya sa acads since nakwento naman nya sakin yung hardships nya and ayun din naman yung sinasabi nya after di sya makachat, busy lang ganon. May time na umabot ng full 2 days na walang syang chat but I did my best para maintindihan sya, may time ding wala syang response sa chat ko for like 1day+ but yung myday nya sa Ig kasama nya lang friends nya sa coffee shop, and wala rin syang narinig saakin non, ni hindi nya minention yun nung nagchat ulit sya sakin and I never asked kung bakit wala syang chat iniisip ko lang na baka drained sya or don't have the energy to chat anyone. Iniisip ko kase common knowledge na yon to have your reason if hindi mo machat yung jowa mo ng matagal. nagsosorry lang sya, pero yung reason wala. At this point paglast chat ako di na ako nagchachat nakakapagod kase magisip kung bakit antagal nya magchat or reply, bakit di sya nakapag goodnight, bakit delivered lang message ko for hours. well she said na babawi daw sya sa aming Christmas break, I looked forward to it but it was a let down.

 1st  week ng Christmas break nila since nauna kami ng 1 week,  well walang nabago wala paring oras saakin, inintindi ko pa din naman since nagsisimbang gabi sya and paguwi nya natutulog sya. Then there's this time na nagpunta kami ng mga classmates ko ng Nation museum since free yung lrt and biglaan din yun after namin mag pa evaluate for 2nd sem sa school, di ko sya binati goodmorning gusto ko makita na kahit sya yung last chat eh ichachat nya parin ako, welp di sya nagchat. Nagchat ako ng 2:00 pm saying na papunta kami ng national museum I sent her updates picture ko, picture ng mga kasama ko, things we've seen there and guess what got left on delivered. Well nakita ko sa myday nya yung ginagawa nilang group proj so I assumed na she's busy so alrighty. Nakauwi ako at 8:00 pm still no response from her, Chinat ko sya na nakauwi na ako and 9:45 pm nagreply sya, nakatulog daw sya, 6:00 pm daw sya nakauwi, and nagsamgyup daw pala sila sa bahay ng classmate nya since birthday non kinabukasan. there's pictures for proof so alrighty. But man I'm really tired playing her games so I did not chat her for full 2 days because I don't have the mental and emotional capacity to start a conversation. after non nagchat ako sa kanya saying sorry dahil di ako nagchat for 2 days because Im tired mentally and emotionally. I also said na nafifeel ko na chinachat nya lang ako pag convenient. Well she said sorry  saying ""fucked up"" daw yung time management nya she also said na maintindihan nya kung ano magiging decision ko sa relationship namin. Welp I did not broke up with her kase she owned her mistake naman and said sorry, di nya rin ini- invalidate yung naramdaman ko, so naayos na kami. kinabukasan nagkaroon na sya ng oras saakin, di ko na nga matandaan kung kelan yung huling time na nagspend sya ng oras sakin. Pero isang araw lang yon, balik nanaman sa dati matagal syang magreply, iniintindi ko parin namin. tas may time pa na di nag goodnight, pero binati ako ng good morning kinabukasan without even mentioning na di sya nakapagoodnight last night. my time din na ambagal nya magreply while we're having a conversation then biglang I'm left on delivered for hours nagtingin ako sa Ig nagnotes sya ng nagbabawi daw tulog so maybe nakatulog sya So alrighty and after 1 hour since she posted the note tsaka sya nagreply. Then yesterday nagpunta ulit sya bahay ng clasmate nya para gumawa ng proj nila. It's past 10pm and wala parin chat kung nakauwi na sya so nag goodnight na ko. Kinabukasan nabasa ko message nya she replied on 11pm saying naglaro pa daw sila but 9pm nakauwi na sya. then there's this TikTok video(mentioned earlier), I don't know what to feel about it. is that supposed to make me feel better? or makes me understand her more?. I read the comments and most of them jinajustify yung video like commenting ""me"" saying na ayun daw dahilan bat di sila nagwork, mga ganong comments. Tsaka di naman sya ganito dati sya yung taong gusto ako kausap palagi eh I don't know what went wrong, simpleng update na nga lang sana eh hayst. So ayun I feel like chinachat nya lang ako pag convenient talaga HAHAHAHA di rin kami legal sa side nya kaya di kami makapagkita kase ano ipapaalam nya pag-aalis sya? sa side ko naman okay na pero ayaw nya pang pumunta dito saying she's not confident enough. di ko rin sya pine pressure about doon wala talaga syang narinig na reklamo puro pag intindi na lang ginagawa ko. Well she did got me a Christmas present, dapat kakain kami sa fast food non para date na din but an hour before, iiabot nya lang daw pala saakin since ang paalam nya daw kukuha ng isinanlang alahas, di nya na din nabalot. I did appreciate it tho, pero siguro I was so starved lang sa oras at atensyon nya, I don't feel important. I don't need gifts I need quality timeeee. It been months since our last date eh.

1hsg5vt,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1hsg5vt/tuscany_honeymoon_visit_best_wine_experiences/,Tuscany Honeymoon Visit - Best Wine Experiences?,"Hi All - 

My fiancée and I will be in Italy for our Honeymoon in September 2025 - sandwiched in the middle of our trip, we'll spend some time in Tuscany (probably 3 nights in Florence, 3 nights elsewhere in a smaller town/the countryside in Tuscany). 

I would love some advice on how to maximize our wine experience!

A few points of context:

* We both favor reds, and I am particularly fond of Sangiovese. Brunello is probably my favorite wine, and I enjoy good Chiantis as well. I haven't tried much Vino Nobile but I'm sure it's great too
* We're in our early 30s
* I am the wine lover in our relationship. She loves drinking wine, but is not really ""into wine"" like me (and all of you)
* We don't speak Italian - enough for greetings, apologies, and to order a coffee or dinner, but not much more than that 
* Given it's our honeymoon and she's not that much of a wine nerd, I'm picturing we'll spend just 1 day entirely/primarily focused on wine - i.e. multiple stops, maybe a guided tour, etc. Perhaps a one-off winery visit or two on other days, or enjoying wines in a good Enoteca would go over really well
* We will have a rental car

All that said, welcome any/all recommendations or advice!

\---------

If you've read this far, thanks. A few specific questions I have:

* How is the language barrier at most wineries? Do they generally speak English, since hosting tourists is a big part of their business? I would feel like a jerk showing up and not being able to communicate
* Is it generally recommended to get a guide, or better to self-curate the producers you want to visit? (I do think the guide would be helpful with the language issue, as well as transportation. There is a premium on making the experience easy and comfortable, especially since it's our honeymoon and she's not as knowledgeable about wine)
* I've seen many of the estates have accommodations - good idea to stay on site?
* What's the best home base? Siena, Montalcino, Montepulciano? In town or at an argriturismo in the countryside?
* What's the etiquette for buying wines during visits? Seems like it might be a little odd not to buy at least a few bottles, is that correct?
* Appreciate any advice on how to ship the wines back. We will have some luggage space but if I buy like 12-24 bottles, it will be difficult to fly them back

1hsg36m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1hsg36m/i_dont_know_if_this_is_the_right_place/,I don’t know if this is the right place. ,"To say I have been absolutely struggling is an understatement. 

I’ve been married 10.5 years, 2 beautiful kids. 

For the first 9.5 years of our marriage, I did ANY and EVERYTHING I could to be the best husband and father that I could be. 

I cook, clean, love housework and yard work. I went to college after the military, supported my wife through nursing school, surprised my wife with little gifts, notes, words of encouragement, support, affirmations, and love. 

There was always something “off” however. She would get upset with me quite often, and over just about anything. 

If I made us coffee on a Saturday morning and said “hey, can I share something with you that was bugging me?” It would EXPLODE into “you ruined our morning, why did you have to bring something up!? You’re always doing this, etc” 

I thought my job was to make her happy and I’d immediately apologize, grovel, tell her how dumb I was for bringing up a topic and make sure she felt loved and happy. 

At the 9.5 year mark (December 2022), she told me she was no longer in love with me, wanted a divorce, things had become boring, and that I couldn’t meet her needs (holding her hand more, greeting her at the door more often with a kiss after work, and holding her hand in the car more often)

I was crippled. Fought with everything I had to keep our marriage going, acknowledging my faults, how I made her feel, etc … lived on the couch for 3 months until she ultimately decided to move out and file for divorce. 

….. then about 6 months later, we decided to try again. She said she took me for granted and I still loved her deeply. We had both dated other people very briefly while separated and this was discussed prior to us reconciling. 

I had been in counseling, journaling, working on myself and never wanted to make the same mistakes. 

Then about a year back into our “new relationship” things began unraveling faster than ever before. 

I made plans for us, date nights, made dinners, bought flowers, made plans with our kids, etc. 

She began telling me again that she felt like I wasn’t making her a priority (I starting my own side business with her blessing that required zero money, and did 99% of it on my own time while she was at work or out of the house). 

She would belittle at times and make snarky comments about things I shared with her (we made hats with our business logo and I excitedly showed her where she didn’t seem very interested and when I asked about this, she said “what did you want me to do? Jump up and down and clap?” 

She accused me of cheating, called me sensitive, told me I wasn’t making her feel like a priority etc. 

She would ask to go through my phone regularly and look through my messages, call logs, emails, etc (never anything in there as I have not cheated, would not cheat, or do anything like that) 

I went on a work trip a few months ago for 2 days. Told her where, what hotel, etc. I called my business partner for 30 minutes … next day my wife tells me she went through the call logs, saw I called him “first” and then we had a 5 hour argument about how I made him my priority, and that a “loving husband” should always call his wife first, no matter what. 

She constantly wants me to read between the lines, and will say “yeah! You should do XYZ! That sounds fun” then after will tell me I broke her heart, hurt her feelings, and didn’t consider her when making the plan. 

She asked me for divorce over text a month ago as I left the house a few days in a row to get away from the environment (being ignored and stonewalled and told I needed to express deep humility and embarrassment before she would talk to me… after ANOTHER argument we had about my “tone” that lasted 30 minutes where I finally blew up and got frustrated) 

She threatened to take custody of the kids, and mentioned my veterans benefits, etc. she told me I wasn’t a constant in the kids lives because I travel 2-3 days every few months for work, smear campaign, had her dad call and cuss me out and threaten me, etc 

I’m just lost. 

Now we’re on the brink of divorce. I’ve chosen to sleep on the couch for the last month because I’m LOST. and she tells me she’s willing to go to counseling, would love to make this work, but she needs me to recognize how badly I’ve messed everything up in our marriage. 

It’s the most soul crushing thing I’ve dealt with. ",4,1735885565.0,Divorce,6,0.84,False

1hsg2fs,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1hsg2fs/aio/,aio ,"Don't let them in.

 Addiction took our mother slowly, rocked her through it and sung her to sleep sunk deep into the mattress on her bed. When her back teeth fell out she left them on the side of the bathtub. I was seven, and I kept them in a match box, the missing pieces of her kept safe, so she wouldn't be lost forever. So maybe one day we could put her back together. Our house fell down around us, and we tried our best to raise ourselves. The ceilings had water damage and the bottom stairs had dry rot and in the winters the radiators would bleed rust. But it was still our house, and Annie made it a home.

My sister Annie mothered me, with lopsided bandaids on bruised knees and lukewarm microwave meals. She told me ghost stories and didn’t mind when I crawled into her bed later on, too scared to sleep alone. She taught me to dance, barefoot on the living room carpet, music channel on full volume on the TV shaking our hips before they were fully grown. She always let me shower first so the water was hot, never complaining when she had to make do with cold. She brushed my hair everyday before school, even when I screamed and hit her when she caught the tangles. Annie was dark haired like her father, whoever he had been, but I was blonde. Annie was desperate to be blonde too, like Marilyn Monroe. Like mom. I think she thought it would make them closer, remind mom less of her dad. I’d give anything for her to have her hands in my hair one more time, even if it hurt. She moved to New York when I turned eighteen and never came back. I still dream about her sometimes.

Keeping up with our mother was impossible and we learnt from a young age we would always be left behind. It didn’t make it any easier. When she was drinking light, she shone, would wake us up at 3am with pancakes, dripping in cherry syrup. Sometimes when the weather was right and she’d had enough being drunk alone, she would call our school up and tell them we had both come down with summer sickness and we’d drive to the beach instead. I remember being nine years old in the backseat of the car coming home after one of our ocean days, sucking the salt from my fingers. Annie had just dyed her hair blonde, her best friend Jane helping her bend over our kitchen sink. From behind, I couldn’t tell who was mother and who was daughter, radio up and windows down blowing the sky inside.

When she was drinking heavy, she’d be out all night, hair piled up like a beauty queen, eyes glazed over and ringed with glitter and black. Sometimes she’d be gone a day or two. She would never tell us when, one day we’d just wake up to an empty house and the fridge packed full, post it note on the front with a smear of moms lipstick in the outline of a kiss, telling us she’d be back soon. Sometimes she’d bring guys home, filling the table with beer cans and ash trays, smoke up to the ceiling, mom lost in the haze. We’d sleep with pillows over our heads, trying to drown out the music they would blast until the am, and wake up to strangers at our kitchen table in the morning, asking us where we kept the coffee. 

When mom drank too little she fell apart. She wouldn’t buy food, refrigerator a gaping hole in the wall. She’d chain smoke, leaving cigarette burns on the wallpaper up by the stairs like the walls were sick and decaying. She barely slept, walking around with blue half moons under her eyes, knuckles raw. She would scream at the slightest thing. I remember once when I spilled a glass of juice on the couch. She looked over at me with dead eyes and dragged me off onto the carpet and then took every single cushion off the couch and into the back yard and set them on fire. Annie went to watch a while from the window and then sat next to me on the floor, backs pressed against the skeleton of the seats, head resting in the crater of my collar bones. 

When mom drank too much was the worst. She’d laugh too loud and too long at anything and everything, until her mouth started to shake and she started crying, at the breakfast table into her cereal. Annie shut down when mom was like this, went somewhere deep inside herself where nobody could hurt her. She’d stay up until the morning watching old black and white movies on TV, whispering the lines she knew by heart like prayers. When I was five I’d cry when I’d find mom passed out cold on her bed, sure she would never wake up. Annie would wipe my tears, tell me she was only sleeping just like the princesses in my story book. We’d sit on moms bed together and wait for her to wake up. When we were older, I was the one who would pick mom up off the bathroom floor again and again and Annie would put her to bed, smoothing her hair off her face and the vomit from her mouth, changing her clothes if she’d pissed herself. Watching them then, there was no doubt that Annie was the mother now.

It was October and I was thirteen, Annie sixteen. It was a Wednesday night and mom had been gone for two days. She’d called us that morning from a pay phone, voice slurring down the line, telling us she was having the best time with all her new friends, hoped we were doing fine. When she asked me if I was having a good birthday I hung up on her. My birthday had been the day before. Annie had given me a pile of presents, strawberry lipglosses and glittery nail polishes. I didn’t ask where she’d got the money for them. I didn’t care. We’d taken the bus to the beach with Jane, eaten the birthday cake she had made for me, sand getting into the frosting. It tasted like sweetness and the sea, and I savoured every bite and scrape of sugar against my teeth. We watched the sun go down, Annie snapping grainy photos on her shitty Nokia as I blew out my candles, wishing over and over that mom wouldn't come home, that she’d just stay gone this time. 

But that Wednesday night, me and Annie weren't speaking. Anger hung heavy between us, seeping through the floorboards. It began when she tripped at the bottom of the stairs. We’d both laughed, Annie throwing her head back, gap between her front teeth catching the light. When I’d bent to pick her up, I’d caught her breath, warm against the freckles on my cheeks. I let go of her arms and she fell again, hitting the floor and grinning, shaking her hair from her face. Her breath was heavy with whiskey. I couldn't start picking her up too, couldn't watch her fall again and again. Just like mom, I knew she’d never get back up. 

I’d stared down at her, blonde hair fallen into her eyes and all I could see was our mother, and then I was running, feet slamming the hallway like heartbeats turned loose. I’d run for the kitchen and tipped every bottle we had down the sink, shoving Annie back as she fought to stop me, catching liquor on her fingers as it fell. She grabbed my shoulders and made me drop the very last bottle. It smashed between us on the floor, glass shards shining like we’d dragged the stars out of the sky and broken them, pieces we could never put back. Outside through the open windows, the sky turned pale gold, clouds a mess of pink and cream smeared across the horizon. I cried then, watching Annie on her knees picking up the pieces. That was Annie, always trying to fix things even when it was too late. 

The smell of food dragged me from my room, stomach turning traitor inside my ribcage. Annie was cooking pasta, real food not made in a microwave. She’d set the table, Tammy Wynette singing softly from the CD player, Annie gently swaying her hips as she stirred the tomato sauce, rich and warm. As we ate in silence, with every bite I forgave her. Mom never cooked dinner, or remembered my favourite was spaghetti ever since I was a kid, or stayed sober long enough to sit up at a table. Annie wasn’t mom.

We were washing the dishes when we first heard it. A moth was crawling down the inside of the pane and I cracked the window to let it out into the dark. From the backyard came a faint sound. I tilted my head to listen as it was coming from far off. Crying. I figured it was Mika the two year old next door having a tantrum loud enough for us to catch, or maybe even Lucky Strike the cat that junkies down the street, begging for food like he sometimes did. I always wanted to feed him when he came around, winding over my ankles, but Annie always stopped me, saying once you started giving they never stopped taking. Looking back, I don’t think she was talking about the cat.

Annie flipped the christmas lights strung up around the porch and we sat on the plastic beach chairs watching the skies. When we were little, we’d sit outside and Annie would tell me the names of all the constellations and the stories of how they came to be hung up in the night sky. I had to grow up before I realised she made them all up as she went along. It was a game we still liked to play now, making up ridiculous stories for the shapes we could pick out. 

“Ah, yes, that one there is the Coors Light. It got there when God dropped it out of his convertible window and never picked it up,” she said, nodding sagely and hiding her smile. 

“Of course,” I said, waving my hands and pointing up past the power lines. “Right next to The Ashtray, left there by angels on a smoke break.”   
 

“Yeah, they say if you wish on it, all your dreams will come true,” said Annie grinning. 

She stopped laughing, voice quieter, face tilted up to all those dead stars. 

“Let’s wish Emmy. Let’s wish” So we did.

The sound of crying interrupted us. It was closer this time, and definitely human. We turned to each other, confused. Annie shrugged and I squinted out into the black. It sounded like a baby, lost and tired and alone. 

“It must be Mika?” I said, slowly getting to my feet. “Maybe he walked around the back? Shit, do you want to call Connie and tell her we’ll bring him over.” Annie didn't reply, and I sighed, rolling my eyes. “Guess I’ll do everything then.” 

I stepped off the porch, grass soft against my heels. The air smelled like it might rain, fresh and clean and growing. A promise unfulfilled.  

“Em.” Annie’s voice was strained. I turned to her, smiling. It died on my face when I saw the look on her own. “Em get inside now.” She was staring out into the dark, past me, opening the door with one hand behind her, fingers fumbling on the catch. I froze, bare foot in the dirt. I’d found what she was looking at. 

In the bushes by the back fence was a person, crouched with their knees tucked up neat under the chin, arms wrapped around legs. Their mouth hung wide, softly opening and closing as he cried. Like a child, lost in the dark. Not like a child, but a someone pretending. Mimicking the sound, open and closed out in the blackness. Suddenly they straightened, snapping upright face still hidden by the black. They were tall and thin, too thin to be a normal person. 

Panic made me move, animal instincts leftover from the days we lived up in the trees carrying me forward. I was faster than Annie, dragging her inside and slamming the door behind us, hearing it bounce on its hinges as I locked it. We watched as the person slowly walked towards the house, steps deliberate and long. 

Annie reached for my hand, holding me tight and turned me to face her, holding my shoulders. 

“Don’t turn around Emmy. Don’t turn around.” Instinctively I started to look over my shoulder out into the darkness. Annie grabbed my face, hard, and shook her head. I knew then she was serious.

“I’m…” her voice cracked, and she cleared her throat, gripping my hand tight enough to hurt, nails digging in, grounding herself. I looked down at our fingers interlocked, both of us grown from the same bones. 

“I’m gonna call the cops and everything is going to be…” her voice faltered, stuttering. Tears spilled over her lashes, dripping like the promise of rain. Annie never cried. 

“Your phone’s on the porch,” she whispered, and bile crawled its way up my throat. Her phone was upstairs, charging. 

A soft, tap-tap-tapping filled the silence. Annie turned to the window, eye whites showing her eyes were so wide.

It was the sound of someone’s forehead against the glass, slowly, over and over. They started to speed up, faster and harder, skin meeting glass until they was slamming into the window hard enough to shake the panes. The tapping stopped and I was about to ask Annie if I could look now when she screamed, followed by the sound of cracking glass and the loudest slam yet. Whoever was in our yard had just smashed their face hard enough into the window to break it. 

We ran upstairs, two at a time, skipping the ones caved in with dry rot on instinct. I turned behind me once and Annie yanked my face back before I could see. The sound of broken glass echoed behind us as we made it to the bathroom, locking the door. A thin, wailing cry, like a baby calling for its mother filled the hallway, trapped between the walls and locked doors. 

Annie threw her back against the door, feet jammed up against the bathtub, clutching the knife she had grabbed from the kitchen. I did the same, shoulder to shoulder. Slow footsteps started on the stairs, deliberate and casual. The crying had become mocking, almost laughter, shrill bursts of sound and then giggles, high pitched and abruptly stopping before starting again. The first door on the upstairs floor was my bedroom and we heard the distinct sound of it slamming open. They were looking for us. 

“What the fuck is going on,” I asked Annie, not even bothering to brush away the tears that I couldn't stop falling. I watched my sister pick herself up off the floor, and brace her hands on the door as we heard the sound of a second door slamming open. Mom’s room. The next room on the hallway was the bathroom. Annie pulled me to my feet and handed me the knife. I shook my head and pushed it back to her, terrified of what would happen if I had to use it. Annie shoved me and pressed the knife into my hands, thumb pressing hard enough on the blade to bleed. I watched my sisters blood drip down her wrist, a winding red road, still pushing into my hands despite the pain. I took the knife.

Something slammed against the wall that mom’s room shared with the bathroom. A high pitched wail followed. I held my breath, could feel my heart beat in the base of my throat, a wild and frantic thing. 

“I’m gonna get the phone from my room.” I shook my head violently about to argue. Annie clamped a hand over my mouth. I could taste the blood on her hand, salty and sweet. Like birthday cake by the ocean. “Yes. I’m gonna get the phone and I’m gonna call the cops and we’re going to be okay.” I shook my head again. “It’s the only way. When I go I need you to lock the door and you don’t open it for anything or anyone. Not for me not for… anyone. Promise me.” I shook my head and Annie pressed her hand into my mouth, crushing my teeth against my lips so it made my eyes water. “*Yes.* Promise me Em.” 

Something smashed in the room next door. Annie brushed the hair off my face, gently tucking it behind my ear. *Promise* she mouthed and unlocked the door as slowly as possible, bolt scraping gently. I watched the curve of her shoulder disappear into the black hall outside, like the moon in eclipse. And then she was gone. I couldn't move or breathe for a second and then I slammed the bolt shut just as something bounced off the outside of the door. A high pitched scream followed, handle rattling up and down hard enough to pop one of the screws. I watched it roll towards me on the tiles. And then silence. 

I sat with my back to the door, holding the knife and wishing I was holding Annie’s hand instead. Still silence. Nothing but me and my lungs slowly filling the room with my breath. 

“Em?” Came a voice through the door. I started, hands gripping the knife. “Honey what’s going on?” 

“Mom?” my voice cracked. “Momma is that you?” I wrapped my arms around myself, shaking, trying to keep myself still. 

“Sweetie it’s okay just open the door. It’s okay just let me in.” The handle rattled again, gentler. “Just let me in, it’s all okay.” She banged on the door and I took my handle of the bolt. 

“Honey I’m sorry. I’m sorry I missed your birthday. I’m sorry I’m such a terrible mother. Please,” her voice broke and she started to cry, “just let me in baby I’m so sorry.” 

I screwed my eyes shut. She sounded so sad and so lost. I just wanted her to hold me like when I was a kid and I’d come in off the swings with a scraped knee. Maybe this time she meant it. Maybe it would all be okay. My hand found its way to the bolt again. 

My sisters voice came through the door, warm and gentle. “Yeah Emilie let us in, it’s all okay.” 

My hand froze on the bolt and I tightened my grip on the knife. Annie never called me by my full name. A hand banged on the door, handle rattling. “Emilie let us IN” Annie’s voice became low and guttural, followed by the same shrill giggles from before. Mom spoke now, pleading and crying, voice getting louder and louder. “Let us in let us in let us in,” over and over again, punctuated by her fists on the door. I thought about demons and monsters, all the bedtime stories we pray don’t crawl out from under the bed. 

“That’s not my sister and you’re not my mother!” I screamed through the door, hands over my head. I climbed into the bathtub and curled in a ball, cradling myself, knife clutched to my chest. I didn’t know what it was outside that door but I knew it wasn’t Annie. It wasn't the voice that yelled at when I changed TV channel, the one that sang  me happy birthday, the one that told me I was smart even when I got bad grades, the one that read me stories about princesses that never wake up.  It wasn’t human. 

Bangs and yells came from downstairs followed by the footsteps of people running. A low guttural howl ripped through the house, filling the room until I felt like I was drowning in the sound and then the door was kicked in. I screamed, covering my eyes, waiting to die. Arms found me and lifted me from the tub carrying me from the room. I looked at the outside of the door as I was carried downstairs. It was covered in long scraping claw marks, dragged down to the floor. Pillows ripped apart covered the hallway in soft down, like it had snowed inside. I watched them drift slowly as men in uniforms checked each of the rooms that looked like they had been torn apart by something feral. 

Outside in our drive way were police cars and an ambulance. In the middle of it all was Annie. Bathed in blue and red light as it washed over her, lit up in the dark like a neon angel, face aglow. I threw myself from the cops shoulder and ran to her, holding us both together, broken pieces and all, standing under all those constellations we made up. Gentle screaming came from the ambulance which rocked occasionally. Annie gently turned my head away, smiling so sadly it made my chest ache as I understood. 

Turns out there was no demon. No wild animal or bad men trying to break in. Just mom, out of her mind on booze and drugs and everything in between, coming to the end of a week long binge. Something had finally broken inside her head, and this time we couldn't put her back together no matter how hard we tried. Sometimes you fall one last time and you never get back up.

Annie had seen her in the garden, blood dribbling from her mouth, track marks bulging on her forearms like unmapped roads, rail thin and desperate for one more hit, one more fix. She’d searched the kitchen for all the drink I’d thrown away and when she hadn’t found it, had come to hunt for the stash she hid in the bathroom. She hadn’t wanted me, just the drugs on the other side of the door, so high she could mimic Annie’s voice almost perfectly. 

Turns out the real monsters are the ones that eat you alive slowly, the kind that come in a bottle or a needle or at the end of a long list of reasons why you can’t get out of bed in the morning. Sometimes the monsters are the ones that raise you or love you the most. But it’s up to you if you let them in.",0,1735885483.0,AmIOverreacting,1,0.5,False

I'm currently pregnant for the second time. Unfortunately, I experienced a miscarriage with my first pregnancy at 7-8 weeks about six months ago. I'm feeling quite anxious as tomorrow will be my third ultrasound since discovering this pregnancy. My doctor hasn't been able to visualize the baby on previous ultrasounds, and I'm worried about the outcome of tomorrow's scan.

I am overweight. I was classified as obese type 2 during my first pregnancy and obese type 1 in this pregnancy. After my miscarriage, I've been making an effort to exercise and have significantly reduced my intake of rice, sugar, and coffee.

My initial beta-hCG level was 4511. A week ago, my doctor prescribed Euthyrox due to elevated TSH levels. I'm currently taking Duphaston, Folic Acid, Euthyrox, and drinking Anmum.

Any advice that could help ease my anxiety would be greatly appreciated.

1hsfxo9,https://www.reddit.com/r/PointlessStories/comments/1hsfxo9/lunch_with_dad_at_230_am/,Lunch with Dad at 2:30 AM,"I grew up in a town with a strong history of industry and manufacturing. It was home to some pretty big steel mills and automobile plants. 

The factories ran around the clock and the workers did too. Luckily, there were plenty of places where those workers could grab a good meal at any hour.

I can recall at least eight 24 hour restaurants within a ten minute drive or walk from my childhood home. 

Most of these places were owned and operated by families of Greek immigrants, and all had a similar ambience. Imagine rotating cases displaying slices of pie and dishes of rice pudding, neon tube lights and Formica tabletops, hanging plants, Greco-Roman pillars made of plaster, colorful wall murals of faraway islands, and decorative fountains that trickled through the night. 

The menus were always huge, and the options limited to just about everything ever made.

When I was about nine years old, I was passing by one of these places and it suddenly dawned on me what ""Open 24 Hours"" actually meant.

I was so intrigued! 

What happened at a restaurant in the middle of the night? Who went there? Could I really order a sandwich at any hour if I wanted to? How did it look inside at that time?

This might sound strange to most adults. But for a child who usually had to be in bed by 10:00 PM at the latest, nighttime was fascinating and mysterious. 

I had stayed up until sunrise a few times, but I did that by reading books and listening to music. The idea that things actually happened outside in the wee hours of the morning was exciting.

When my birthday rolled around that summer, my parents asked if there was anything I wanted.

I asked to ""go to a restaurant at 2:30 AM.""

Both of my parents were puzzled by this. Mom wasn't up for the idea, but my dad seemed oddly amused and agreed to make it happen!

On a warm summer night, I sat wide awake in the living room, watching infomercials while I waited for my alarm clock to go off.

Finally it was 2:30 AM and I went upstairs to tell my dad that it was time to go. He was already dressed and ready. 

We drove to the closest spot and could already see crowds of people through the big windows. My dad explained that this was called the ""drunk rush,"" and that it happened regularly as people left bars and clubs for the night. 

""If anyone starts throwing things, get under the table,"" he told me.

We went inside and a kind server guided us through a group of leather-clad bikers to a cozy booth in the corner. 

Dad ordered a cup of coffee and a bagel with cream cheese and grape jelly, which I found a little odd. I had spanakopita. 

We ended up having a long conversation. We discussed open-ended questions about dreams, travel, and the biology of frogs. Then we drove home like nothing had happened and went straight back to bed. 

My poor parents. They must have thought the story was over. 

But I was hooked. 

I wanted to do it again. And again. 

My dad is a soft-spoken, bespectacled professor who can doze off anywhere. He's hardly an outgoing ""night person."" He was still amused by my fascination, though, and sometimes agreed to go out for lunch with me at ""some ungodly hour,"" as he used to put it. 

I think we ended up doing this a total of five or six times, usually as a reward for hard work in school or to celebrate a special event. 

I loved every outing, even if I now feel guilty to realize how tired dad must have been. 

The steel factories and automotive plants in my hometown have all since closed down. Most of the diners closed along with them. The few that remain dramatically cut back their hours about ten years ago. Most are already closed by 9 PM. 

I live alone now and I've been through some very rough things over the past few years. I often have trouble sleeping. It's Midnight as I'm typing this, and I probably won't get back to bed for another hour or so.

When I feel this way, I find myself wanting a cozy booth, a big laminated menu, and some good conversation with dad. 

This world needs a diner.

Viv , karan, rajat ?????","It's my prediction that Vivian dsena is going to lift the trophy of bigboss 18 by a fullproof makers plan , And karanveer would be first runner-up, Although according to voting , rajat has the maximum votes but they will kick him out just before the finale , in initial days rajat and Vivian had a rivalry and Rajat used to almost hate Vivian but if that rivalry would have continued till finale and then makers would have evicted rajat and made Vivian the winner ,then so many questions would have raised on the show by his  supporters ,so very conveniently makers started making things in a way that rajat and Vivian came under the good terms and they had a common rival as karanveer, It was evident in that nomination task where they were showing photos as rishtey of the house , makers very conveniently showed the pic of rajat hugging Viv from the back and it made all others go awwww, viv and rajat's fandom also gang up and started targeting common rival karan only , Now viv-karan and rajat- karan rivalry is the talk of this season , rajat's mother is also okk in having vivian as winner other than rajat , cause she only have problem with karan  , So makers whole strategy is going to work successful, viv is having a strong vote bank not because of game but because of being from a specific community (from which previous season winners like Stan, munawar and saba maqbul were from), rajat somewhere knew that viv has done nothing in the show to be a winner but his hatred towards karan is making him like Vivian over him , Makers whole plan is going to be successful, viv will lift the trophy and Rajat will be evicted and no one will raise question on makers cause rajat's supporters will be okk with that , even in after interviews or podcasts of rajat, he will seen as targeting karan only and praising Vivian , In this way makers decision of making a television actor as winner and using controversial social media person for trp only will be successful, karanveer was just made a scapegoat for all this planning, he was purposely pulled up by makers in game cause they had figured out that he is the only person who can distract rajat from viv,  and karan- rajat's rivalry will automatically turn rajat - Vivian in good terms , Makers purposely did everything after that like calling it ""the  karanveer mehra show "" so that Vivian and Rajat's fandom  strongly came together and target karan , Makers purposely edit out anything from the show that can turn Vivian and Rajat's fandom against each other , like when chum became TG for the first time and whole rashon was taken out from the house and viv was telling everyone in the morning to listen to him then there was a fight between viv and Rajat, where Rajat used some remarks like ""tere baap se puch kar nhi karunga ,tu hai kaun be coffee lekar leta pada tha purey show m""  and many such things , and guess what makers edited all this in the episode so that the long dead rivalry of viv- rajat doesn't start again , even nouran also knew about all this masterplaning of makers and that's why she chooses to say only good things about rajat , so that his fandom support viv after winning BB ,This is the masterplan of makers , they not gonna make rajat winner cause of his past crimes and violent behaviour in the show towards others , because doing so will set a wrong message among upcoming contestants in future , Karanveer is going to get all the hate from most of the contestants and viv- rajat's fandom even after the show ,And rajat and his fandom  will never know or accept the fact that they are looted off from  the trophy and made fool by the makers , karan was anyway not going to win the season , he had high margin in voting as  compared to rajat and medium margin as compared to Vivian ,if only rajat would not be evicted , then rajat is winner according to votes , Vivian is first runner up and karan is second runner up .",1,1735884947.0,BigBoss18Gossips,7,1.0,False
