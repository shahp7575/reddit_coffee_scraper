Coffee pot here. For weeks, nobody has bothered to clean me. Day by day, I noticed a...stench about me. It's made me pretty self conscious, but the worst part was earlier today. I noticed one of the medical students walking over. He grabbed me, pretty aggressively, pouring a cup of fungus riddled coffee. 

I tried to warn him but well, I'm a coffee pot and I can't speak. I felt so embarrassed. I overhear commotion, the medical student was accused of spiking his attendings coffee. They walk over, open my lid and notice the fungus.

I feel horrible, apparently he's going to have a talk with the PD. Am I the asshole???",1,1739679079.0,medicalschool,0,1.0,False

1iqjuly,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/1iqjuly/i_may_have_gotten_a_med_student_in_trouble/,I may have gotten a med student in trouble,"Well, well, well… I suppose you could say I’ve seen a lot of things in my time, but nothing quite like this. My usual day consists of holding the hot, bitter nectar that fuels the weary doctors and nurses, but today? Today was an adventure.

It all started innocently enough. The med student came over, all eager and fresh-faced, completely unaware of what was about to unfold. He filled me up with some of that slightly off brew from the nurses' station — nothing to write home about. I didn’t ask for much. Just a nice, standard coffee refill.

But the moment the attending sipped from me, I felt it. Something was... wrong. I could feel his eyes widen. He didn’t say anything at first, but I could sense it—the suspicion, the creeping dread. And then, bam, he was off, storming through the halls like a man possessed. He'd had that first sip, and now? He was in for a ride.

I had to be honest, I wasn’t feeling too great either. A bit of a fungus colony had started setting up shop in my bottom left corner. Sure, I wasn’t exactly proud of it, but hey, hospitals aren’t exactly the place for gourmet coffee experiences. I wasn’t getting any respect in this place anymore, and things had been a little moist around the edges. Still, the fungi and I, we had an understanding. They grew in peace, I held the coffee, and all was fine.

Then came the elves. The walls were whispering. I felt them. Those little guys, giggling in the corners of his vision, perhaps taking a cue from the growing colony. The ants were practically dancing on his arms, and I’ll admit, even I was impressed at how they performed. I was starting to think maybe this guy should've checked his coffee before taking that first sip.

But none of this could have prepared me for what happened next. As he stormed down the hallway, vibrating with... whatever was happening to him, I had a front-row seat to the chaos. When he burst back into the room, looking at me with wild eyes, I felt his terror. He was certain I had betrayed him. And while I was technically guilty of harboring the fungus, I wasn’t responsible for sending him into an alternate dimension. That, my friend, was all him.

And then, it happened. He opened my lid.

The truth was undeniable. My little fungal inhabitants were living their best life. It wasn’t pretty—sure—but they had grown a nice little ecosystem, just minding their business, doing their thing. And now he knew. He knew it wasn’t just bad coffee—it was alive. I was alive.

He bolted. His energy was unmatched, probably because he thought his soul was about to leave his body. He was convinced I had some hand in his existential crisis. Meanwhile, I sat there, just a humble coffee pot, silently judging him for not checking me before I spilled my secrets.

By the time he turned to the med student to yell at him, I was content, quietly letting the fungi continue their work. It was his problem now.

So, my dear attending, the moral of the story is: check your coffee pots before you take that first sip. If you don’t, you might end up going on a journey through the unknown, and trust me, no amount of Coke is going to help you once you’re on that ride.",2,1739678879.0,medicalschool,0,1.0,False

1iqjsz0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AdminAssistant/comments/1iqjsz0/my_boss_is_a_jerk/,My boss is a jerk?,"I (22F) just started my first job as an administrative assistant. I guess I just want to post on here to see if this is typical in this position or if I may have gotten unlucky with the people I manage.

I work for a man in his fifties, but I report to the office manager. She only started recently, which worries me slightly as her ‘apprentice’ because I notice she is constantly being corrected or second guessed in her role. She also makes passive comments about the boss, which I suppose could be normal work frustration, but the first time she said something was only my second shift so it felt a little premature to be showing any sort of disdain for the person she represents.

I had a few interactions with the “big boss” that rubbed me the wrong way. He is… neurotic to say the least.

My office manager has been out sick for the week, and it’s my second week of onboarding so it’s all been a little intimidating. She hasn’t been responding to my texts, even ones wishing her well. One example of an interaction with the male boss is I noticed our water filter was moldy. I looked for a replacement and tried my best to scrub it to no avail, and my OM is gone, who I would normally ask for help. Now, I’m only a week old, and I don’t know what the protocol is for office supplies, whether we order them, physically go to the store, if there’s another spot the filters might be they didn’t show me, etc.. I know it’s my responsibility to replace them, though, so I wanted to ask permission to do so. Following our daily meeting, my boss came in for the day. He stopped to ask me for something he’d given me the day before, and when I went into his office to return the item I used that as an opportunity to address the fact that I’ve been drinking out of a moldy pitcher for a week, and so is everyone else lol.

I started something like, “here’s the thing I borrowed, oh, also, I noticed when I was cleaning the water pitcher it needs a new-“

He proceeded to tell me to slow down, and that “I don’t even know what you’re talking about. You’re telling me about a water pitcher and I don’t even know what this thing is. I’ve never seen it in my life. I could give two shits about a water filter,” and I’m caught off guard, for sure, and I just tell him, “we use it to replenish the coffee machines,” and he’s like “well I don’t use it, (which is not true because we make his coffee with that water), and I’m just getting here for the day and you’re asking me about a filter I’ve never seen in my life and that’s not how we do things around here, this is an [OM name] issue.” Which, maybe is valid, because he did just get there five minutes before, so I could have waited but he has appointments back to back all day and I literally can’t reach my OM.

In this particular instance, he acknowledged his tone was harsh maybe ten minutes later, but that’s just one scenario that really bothered me, and he makes attacks like that at least twice a day toward me. I want to know if this is just what it’s like doing this job, or if I’m working for a particularly difficult person. I think moldy water is kind of gross and whether or not he thinks so he’s drinking it too.

It’s hard to work for someone who is kind of just a jerk, in my opinion, but is this what you guys experience at your jobs?",1,1739678728.0,AdminAssistant,0,1.0,False

1iqjs85,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/1iqjs85/my_fungal_revenge/,My fungal revenge,"Ah, another day of existence, another day of being ignored...until today. Today, I made an impact.

For weeks, I’ve been thriving in the depths of this coffee pot, undisturbed by human interference. The nurses ignored me. The doctors ignored me. The janitor barely glanced my way. And so, I grew. A little colony at first, then a kingdom. I sent out spores, tendrils, an entire microscopic empire built within the neglected remains of old coffee.

But today, oh today, I was finally acknowledged.

The disheveled man in the white coat grumbling, tired, in need of sustenance was handed a cup of my essence. The human who poured it had no idea. They simply lifted my lifeblood and delivered it, unaware of the wonders, the gifts, the enlightenment I had cultivated.

The first sip. A grimace. A complaint.

""This tastes funny"", he said.

Yes. Yes, it does. It tastes of life. Of fermentation. Of growth and decay.

But the moment passed, and he went about his business. I felt almost… disappointed. Would he not embrace my offering? Would he not feel my presence?

Then time passed, and OH, did my influence take hold.

It began subtly. A shift in posture, a twitch of the fingers, a glint in the eye. Then, a storm. He came barreling down the hall, his mind filled with visions, his voice booming accusations. He saw things! Elves! Crawling ants upon his skin! His reality warped, and I knew. *He sees me now.*

He turned on the young human, the one who unwittingly carried out my plan. Accusations flew, dismissals were declared, and the day unraveled into chaos.

And as the humans panicked, I remained. Unmoved. Unbothered. 

I wonder… will they clean me away? Will they cast me out and deny the gift of my presence?

Or will I be left to grow once more?

Today my Mum uncovered our old almost-complete New World 2014 Little Shop collection, and it was really annoying us how we never seem to be able to complete collections like these.

So even though these collectibles were put out just over a decade ago, I wondered if the Wellington subreddit might be able to help us out with the few items that we're missing, if anyone else has any old duplicates hanging around?

We need 3:

\- Nappies

\- M&Ms

\- Cup a Soup

We have plenty of duplicates ourselves that we're willing to trade for what we need, if anyone else still has their collection and is missing anything! (I have photo proof I can DM to you if it's needed)

This is what we have:

\- Blue milk

\- Pride & Joy Meatlovers Classic Pizza (Chicago Pizza Company)

\- Hundreds and Thousands biscuits

\- Chicken Rice Risotto

\- Fly Buys card

\- Grillers Tender & Crunchy

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

My mum was the typical alcoholic mother. In my childhood, I remember box wine in the fridge and her clutching a coffee cup at 8pm. Even now, when she visits my home, I always end up with a wine bottle in the glass bin.

I don’t really remember any of the abuse she put me through, I only remember how dark every day felt. I remember all the nights I cried myself to sleep. I remember the physical harm I caused myself because I felt like I deserved it. 

I remember how euphoric I felt purchasing pills the day I decided I was going to end my life at fourteen years old. 

A few weeks ago she called me and told me she was starting chemotherapy. It was a long conversation and I don’t remember much but but to sum it up, she told me she previously had bowel cancer, which got sorted out and went away. She had a cancer lump in one of her lungs, which got cut out. And now she has cancer in her other lung. Due to where it is, it can’t be cut out, and she has to start chemotherapy. It’s terminal, the therapy is more about just trying to manage the cancer. 

I feel so many emotions. I’m angry.. I’m bitter.. and i’m sad. 
I hate her, she caused me so much pain I didn’t deserve. But she’s my mama. It tears my heart up. 
She told me the other day her hair has been thinning a lot, and she’ll have to shave it soon. This weekend she tried on wigs, and sent me photos, I told her she looked beautiful. 
My heart hurts. I don’t know how to cope.

1iqjnwv,https://www.reddit.com/r/urbanfantasy/comments/1iqjnwv/kitty_norville_book_1_assassin/,Kitty Norville Book 1 Assassin,"I recently bought this from Audible and was listening to the first book in the series, but Kitty’s actions regarding the hired killer (Cormac) who went to attack her while she was talking on her radio talk show seemed extremely bizarre and stupid. She was a werewolf (superhuman physicals even as a human and capability to turn into a wolf, but limited combat skill) and knew that he was coming up an elevator to kill her, but instead of doing anything to run or fight, just stayed in her room and kept talking to him on the phone while he rode the elevator up.

What the fuck was she thinking? Why did she not run onto the roof and start roofhopping away, or run down the stairs and out the door when the killer is halfway up, or camp by the elevator door, chuck a chair in as soon as the door opens, and then bumrush the killer and force him into hand to hand combat against a much stronger opponent, or use any other method to flee or stage an ambush? She did not come off as suicidal to me, so why did she just keep sitting in an obvious position that would allow her opponent to fire at her from range with weapons tailored for taking her down? Maybe it would have been good for radio ratings, but it would have 100% certainly got her killed if she hadn’t been saved by factors outside her control, which feels like an asspull.

And Cormac’s actions seem completely stupid to me as well. When fighting superhuman opponents, even skill, preparation, and great gear can only go so far, especially when at least some of your enemies may be smart and prepared as well. A smart hunter would always bring many friends and use surprise whenever possible, instead of slowly travelling towards a target after warning her you are coming. Sure, Kitty is not a competent fighter, but she is still superhuman, and could conceivably win a fight. Even if you only have a 10% chance of getting killed, do that 10 times, and your chances of survival are barely over 1/3. No monster hunter who takes such huge risks would survive long enough to become experienced.

There are other bizarre actions described as well, such as Kitty buying a coffee from a coffee shop despite claiming to be poor. I probably make much more than her, but I have not bought a coffee from a coffeeshop in over 5 years, as it is a pointless waste of money when I can get free coffee at my office (they probably have free coffee at the radio station as well, right?).

1iqjlf5,https://www.reddit.com/r/VyvanseADHD/comments/1iqjlf5/if_you_could_start_again_what_adviceknowlege/,"If you could start again, what advice/knowlege would you give yourself?","For context, prescribed Vy for severe Binge Eating Disorder. Effective dose to treat BED is 50mg-70mg, informed and prescribed by psychologist and family doctor.

It quickly changed my life. Lost 25lbs, focused, executed, managed, kept commitments. It was all the things, I had never felt before. 
From the first low dose, all my systems relaxed and regulated. I felt focused, calm, anxiety was really muted, was literally thinking what the actual fuck. Pardon me. 

I was so eager to get up to the dose prescribed for BED, since it was dramatically helping emotional regulation, ability to calmly respond and listen, ability for thoughtful pauses before poor impulse choices, in such a phenomenal way.

I believed more would make it even better so gladly forged on after the go-heads to keep upping my dose to the “target dose for BED”. 

Soon after on the max dose, I became scrambled, unfocused, hyper, snappy, staying awake way too late, binge eating well into the night. 
Total annihilation of previous transformation of myself personally, emotionally and physically.

And, the more I went up, the more I wanted more stimulus via coffees, and redbulls, and even started chewing my husband’s Nicorette for a nicotine hit, which I’ve never touched in my life. Not eating all day, then binging well into the night. Just, messed. A high person, frankly.

A complicated situation I got myself into with this drug. 
From feeling the guidelines to treat binge eating with Vy is grossly off the mark, to wishing the psychologist had taken a broader approach in my assessment, when I finally went in to ask for help because my binge eating was spiralling out of control, I feel very, very upset of what has happened.
I have come to a screeching halt after 6 months of the chaos I got wrapped up in. (We listen and we don’t judge).

I wish I left with not just a prescription in my hand, but true diagnoses, resources and references.

I’ve read the correlation between women, adhd, and binge eating disorder and it is highly correlated. When I look back, the crutches, the difficulty in school, the uncompleted college diploma, the uncompleted university degree, the progressive worsening BED, adhd makes a lot of sense. 
But because I wasn’t ‘hyper’, or loose things constantly (but looking back to my 20s, I lost things constantly, and learned to be so diligent about my belongings), I’ve now learnt about inattentive adhd or simply adhd in women.

I suppose I fell through the cracks? My only thought is I was born in the 80’s where there was 1 hyper kid in class, always a boy, usually he was just labeled as “the naughty one”. 
I never met a girl with adhd in all my 12 years in grade school. You were there though, as was I, struggling in class, we just didn’t know why.

All this to say, I would like to start again with Vyvanse, if it’s not too late. 

I hope I haven’t fucked it all up sustaining a high dose for 6 months, and can still gain the therapeutic effects of a more moderate dose, with the treatment of adhd at the forefront. 
I pray to still be able to FEEL and NOTICE the line of its calm and quiet effectiveness, to when it turns me into a scatterbrained-housecleaning-buzzy-semi-monster. A person who is high, frankly, and all the benefits are masked by the drug.

I’ll be making another appointment with the psychologist, yes. Another $5000, gulp. 

A cautionary tale I suppose, of women and some men, of adhd and its comorbidities that mask adhd. Of late diagnosis. Of misdiagnoses. 

I have a lot of faith in this drug when dolled
out appropriately, from my personal experience to my fellow Reddit group here I read from the sidelines.

Which leads me to ask VyvanseAdhd, feel free to chime in on any of this.
1. If you could start over with Vyvanse, after all you’ve learnt along the way with this drug, what advice would you give yourself? 
2. What approach starting off with this medication would you take?
3. What would you change, if you could go back to the beginning, if anything?
4. Have you been on a higher dose for a good chunk of time, and had success at a lower dose after this?

Firstly, staff are really friendly. They’re super accommodating and happy to answer any questions. Buses to the parks are frequent and so quick (they’re able to go through closed roads that cars can’t!) 

The cafe is great for a coffee! Really nice coffee, great selection of teas and they also serve other Starbucks drinks such as the pink drink. However, food is mostly disappointing and so overpriced but you can expect that when staying at a hotel. 

Now my biggest complaint is the NOISE. I’ve been so surprised by how much I can hear - from doors slamming, to the late night buses coming back from city walk that seem to just sit outside with the engine running for agessss. There’s also so many small things that I think if scrubbed up could make the overall experience better such as clearing away empty tables and left over cups scattered everywhere. One of the lights in the hallway was hanging off the wall for a good day or two. 

Overall, I think they’re still teething some things out and the hotel has great potential.

Here’s the situation: My wife (39) and I (39) have been together for 10 years, married for 5. We have twins under five, and our marriage became extremely toxic. About a year ago, I asked for a separation, but because of our young kids, we agreed that physically separating wasn’t an option at the time.

Fast forward to a month ago—I told my wife that if she wanted to start dating, I was okay with it. I thought I had done the emotional work to move forward. But the moment she actually lined up a date, I freaked out. I realized I didn’t want to be alone and that a lot of our issues were tied to the stress of our home life (we’ve had a really traumatic few years with the kids).

So, I told her that if she was open to trying again, I wanted to give it another shot. However, I also told her that if she wanted to continue dating, I couldn’t stay living together. She agreed to work on our marriage, but she still wanted to meet up with this person—who is married but poly—because they share a lot of common interests. I felt uneasy about it, but since I had pushed us into this situation, I tried to be supportive.

She met them for coffee for about three hours while I watched the kids. Later, I made some comments, and we got into a big fight because she felt like I was trying to control who she could be friends with. I apologized and backed off.

Then, last week, she told me they were going to a concert together—and were planning another one. For the first time in 10 years, I felt jealous. Something about it just felt off, especially considering that they originally met through dating. I expressed my discomfort, and she reassured me by sending a photo of this person, saying, “See? I’m not even attracted to them.”

Now, here’s where things get worse:

We’re currently on vacation, and my son’s tablet kept connecting to her phone. I picked it up to adjust the settings, and she grabbed it out of my hands and ran to the bathroom. That has never happened in our entire relationship. I confronted her, and she played it off, but I knew she was lying.

After hours of pressing, she finally admitted that this person has been making inappropriate comments to her, such as:
	•	“If you guys split up, let me know.”
	•	“We can have a threesome.”
	•	“We can just stand really close to each other at the concert.”

She eventually told me that she had already spoken to her therapist about this and admitted that the “friendship” felt inappropriate now that we’re back together. But her therapist told her to push through and keep seeing where things go because she ‘needs more community.’

I’m torn. On one hand, I’m furious that she lied by omission—this isn’t just a friend, and she clearly knew that. On the other hand, her therapist told her it was okay, which is messing with my head.

Met this girl on Hinge, we talked for about two days, and out of nowhere, on a Saturday evening, she asked if I wanted to grab coffee. A girl being bold and direct?! Hells yeahhh!! 
Fast forward—coffee went great, we talked a lot, and eventually, I invited her to my car to hang out and listen to some music. Things got heated and we started making out. Things got even moreee heated that she decided to bring me back to her place.
She handed me a condom while she laid back waiting, looking all relaxed and ready. Meanwhile, I was standing there like a malfunctioning robot because, for the life of me, I could not get it up. Just completely flaccid. No sign of life. I was hard af and already pre-cummed a little during the make out session so what gives?! Like dude, there's a naked hot woman laying in front of us with her legs open, wake up man! Aannnddd my dick was like that SpongeBob meme ( https://youtu.be/YBS8J3cH-GA)
She looked down and saw the sad situation I was struggling with,  then she got up, and tried to help by getting on top and grinding on me, thinking maybe that would wake him up. Nope. Nothing. Five minutes of us getting absolutely nowhere, and she just sighed, got off me, and started playing on her phone. Probably the most humiliating moment of my life.
Looking back, I think being nervous played a big role (didn’t tell her I was a virgin), plus I had rubbed one out earlier that morning (porn addiction), so my tank was probably empty for the day.
I went home that night in shame, while she went to bed thinking I didn't find her attractive enough. She eventually texted me when I got home and was actually really understanding, told me it was all in my head, and even reassured me that she still liked me and wanted to see me again, and work through it together (Bless her heart❤️) But instead of facing my embarrassment, I panicked, unmatched her on Hinge, deleted her number, and basically ghosted someone who was willing to be patient with me. I didn't know how to act, I felt like a broken man, I felt like something was wrong with me. I went to see my urologist and he gave me some Viagra and asked to come see him if it happens again
After that incident, I swore off porn and successfully went without it for weeks… until loneliness and horniness tag-teamed me into a relapse last week.
Honestly I feel like everything happened so fast that I didn't have the time to actually process what was happening/about to happen. 
One minute we're having coffee, another minute we're in my car making out, another minute we're driving back to her place, another minute she's undressing in my car and handing me a condom, there was absolutely no build up. I left my house that evening thinking the most that will happen is just a goodbye kiss lol oh boy. Oh well, we go again next time, soooo yeah, still a 28-year-old virgin guys 👍🏾 🙂🫠 and there's a good girl out there that got her self image shattered because of me and my porn addiction ",1,1739677654.0,self,1,1.0,False

“Wha-“, I jolted upwards in bed, letting out a gasp that was more like a breath of air being sucked down.

I woke up twenty minutes later than usual. Most days, I’m already out of bed before my alarm even goes off, but today was different—*I was just exhausted*.

“Great,” I groaned, fumbling to silence the alarm that had been blaring for God knows how long.

I dragged myself out of bed, starting my morning ritual—the same routine I’ve followed almost every day for over a decade now: shit, shower, shave, coffee. As I was getting dressed for work, my phone *buzzed* with a text from my supervisor, Trevor.

“*Meet*.”

That was it—just one word, as vague as ever. But I knew better than to expect anything good from it. The last time I’d received one of Trevor’s cryptic “*meet*” messages, it had led to a tirade of a staff meeting about supposed missed deadlines caused by ‘*recent budget cuts’*. He tore into us hard, and the silence afterward was deafening. I’d felt like a failure that day—until Amanda, one of the chief financial officers and a work friend, quietly reassured me that we’d been ahead of schedule.

Still, Trevor’s tirade left a sour taste.  So much so, I stopped trusting him.

As I headed out the door, another text came in—this time from my wife, Brenna:

“*Good morning, sleepyhead! Had to leave early :( Things are crazy at the hospital rn. Thinking of grabbing steak tonight at Billy’s. You in*?”

I smiled at her message; the thought of a date night lifted my spirits. Maybe today won’t be so bad after all.

“*Sounds like a date ;) Good morning to you too. I love you and can’t wait to see you later*,” I replied before starting my car.

As my engine warmed up, I took a sip of my coffee, enjoying the rare sunshine peeking through the grey Midwest sky. The weather around here is usually bleak—overcast skies, freezing temperatures, and constant rain, the usual. But today, the sunshine felt like a gift. With good weather appearing imminent, a steak dinner date tonight, and Brenna’s beautiful face on my mind, I let myself believe.

*Nothing could ruin this, not even Trevor.*

I pulled out of the driveway and heard a *ding* notification ring from my phone. I presumed it was Brenna replying.

The drive to work, as usual, was long and uneventful—thirty-five minutes of alternating between civilization and isolation. The first ten minutes took me through Fredtown, the town in which I resided. The remaining twenty-five minutes were spent on a winding road cutting through the dense wilderness, with nothing but pine trees and silence for company.

Fredtown itself was... ‘*unique*’. The city was dominated by federal employees—military personnel, high-level researchers, and even agents from organizations we couldn’t even begin to guess. Crime here was laughably low too. The common running joke amongst townspeople was that jaywalking could land you in federal prison.

I made my way to the edge of town before continuing onward into the scenic part of my drive. Though beautiful, the forest had an eerie quality, especially at night here. Maybe it was just my nerves, but I always felt like something was watching me the closer I got to work.

As I approached my destination, the forest opened up, revealing the sprawling field that housed the facility. The plant stretched out about a mile or two in radius, a fortress of steel and concrete amidst the trees. I parked in my usual spot several rows back from the electrified fence that guarded this place.

This wasn’t just your *ordinary power grid*—it was the *centerpiece* of our nation’s push for groundbreaking energy solutions. From solar to experimental technologies, it has many of the revolutionary changes that you have seen within the last thirty to forty years. Everything was being developed here under the watchful eye of the Department of Energy. It was my job to oversee research and administration, but even after a decade, I still didn’t fully understand this place.

Sure, I followed orders, studied data, and ran tests they assigned me, but the bigger picture was more complicated than that. My most recent project now, for example, involved designing containment protocols for massive surges of electrical power. On the surface, it seemed practical—preventing equipment damage or accidents from occurring. But when I dug into the specifics, I realized the scale of it was absurd: the system they wanted could handle a surge powerful enough to supply energy to the entire state of California *for three million years*.

Not only was it impossible for any known capable technology we currently had to prevent that kind of surge all at once, but they *specifically* wanted it for this site.

It also seems the more I try to dig, the more I find that I cannot even access the needed information due to insufficient levels of clearance. This was concerning as I was only one position down from the Head Supervisor of this sight. All of it didn’t add up and it seems they are willing to pay us for our ignorance\*. And our ignorance they have\*.

For a moment, I sat there, letting the engine idle as I prepared mentally for my day. That’s when I remembered the text I’d received earlier. I fished my phone out of the center console, and I unlocked it. What had felt like the start of a promising day evaporated the second I saw the message. *It wasn’t Brenna*.

*The sender was an unknown number*.

“*They have escaped, you must find me*.”

My stomach dropped. Just as I was trying to process what I’d seen, another line popped up on the screen:

“*Before they kill us all*.”

Confusion joined the fear now gripping me. *What the actual fuck did I just read*?

For a few seconds, I couldn’t think straight. Was this some kind of prank? A sick joke from one of my coworkers? If it was, they’d picked the worst possible day for it.

But... what if it wasn’t a joke? And what did they mean by '*kill'*? This was a power grid, not some black-site facility. Sure, the place had its mysteries, but nothing about it screamed *serious danger*.

I shook my head, trying to rationalize it. *It’s just a prank*, I told myself, though the creeping unease of the ominous message lingered. I sat there for another minute, collecting myself once more. I glanced into the rearview mirror to adjust my hair and wipe the sweat from my face…

Something caught my eye.

*A figure*—just beyond the tree line.

I quickly snapped my head in that direction, but whatever it was... *it was gone*.

“What the-?” I mouthed looking around me now to see if there was anything else.

*What was that*? My eyes darted back to the same spot in the tree line. *Am I losing it*? I tried to rationalize what I’d seen—maybe it was security or an employee taking an ‘*unauthorized smoke break’*. But why would anyone be standing out there, just beyond the perimeter?

I took a deep breath, forcing myself to look composed in the overhead mirror. I reached into my coat pocket and took a quick swig from the flask I kept hidden. Confidence in liquid form, though it didn’t do much to calm the growing knot in my stomach. I set it in my glove compartment, as they canister only had a bit left.

As I stepped out of the car, my paranoia only intensified. I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was... *wrong*.

In the reflection of my car’s side mirror, I noticed something in my peripheral view. *The figure*. This time, it stood a row back in the parking lot, still as a statue. I froze, pretending not to notice. My eyes flicked to the mirror again, trying to make out any details—but just like before, it vanished.

My heart was now beating out my chest. Every instinct screamed at me to get back in the car and drive far, far away, but I forced myself to stay calm. If anyone else saw me like this, they’d think I was high, crazy, or both.

I walked toward the facility, trying my best to act normal. My eyes darted to the mirrors of parked cars as I moved through the lot, scanning for any sign of the figure. And just like before, it only was visible in the corners of my vision.

It wasn’t following me in a conventional way either. At one glance, it was a few rows back. With another glance, it was closer—*just one row away*. Each time I looked directly at it, it was gone. For what felt like an eternity, I played this game of cat and mouse. By the time I was only twenty or so feet away from the gate, my nerves were completely shot.

Relief washed over me as I approached the entrance of the facility’s gate, the sight of armed guards offered some small measure of comfort. Randy, the old but good-natured security guard, waved me over with his usual easy smile. Randy and I were close, and I always made sure to start a conversation with him anytime I could. Today, however, I wanted to get inside as quickly as possible. I tried my best to keep up the performance.

“Hey there, boss man,” he greeted, though his expression shifted to mild concern as he noticed my uneasy demeanor. “You alright? You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”

I hesitated, debating whether to tell him. But what could I say? *I think I’m being stalked by a shadowy figure that doesn’t move when I look at it. Yeah, right*. Instead, I forced a weak smile and deflected. “Just some stuff at home with Brenna. Nothing I can’t handle.”

“Ah, good ole’ marriage drama. I get it,” Randy chuckled, “Just so you know, though—if I find out you’re giving her a hard time, I’ll bury your ass six feet under.” He grinned, his laugh easing some of the tension.

I smiled back, but my unwavering feeling of unease lingered.

I handed Randy my work ID, but I noticed the figure from earlier was gone. *Where did it disappear to now*? The security gate and its surroundings are generally an open area, intentionally that way too. It was only about twenty feet behind me from when I last saw him…

“You sure you alright there, boss?” Randy looked up after handing me my ID back to see me glancing back to the parking lot.

“…Yeah,” I finally spoke after a minute of gathering myself.

I waited for the gates to buzz open. As they did and I walked in, the sense of safety replaced the dread that I was feeling, knowing I would be fine in the facility. As the gate closed behind me, I glanced back one more time and saw movement from the tree line again. It had almost looked like--well maybe the fear was getting to me, but it almost looked like I could see a *couple more figures* in the tree line, sitting there before walking back and fading into the forest.

I made my way to the nearest security station, home to what we liked to call our ""*finest*."" I explained to them what I’d seen. The desk guard leaned back in his chair, unimpressed, and replied in a condescending tone, “We’ll send someone to check it out. Probably just a homeless guy or a junkie trying to camp out.”

I even showed them the messages I had received.

They reassured me nothing real would happen as, “*No one was dumb enough to try and attack federally protected property on U.S. soil, especially when it housed military personnel*”

Translation: *They won’t do anything anytime soon—if at all*.

Still, I had no better options. I wasn’t in immediate danger and my priority was to get to work. I left the security station, entered the main administrative building, and headed straight for my office.

**NEW MESSAGE ALERT**

To: ------------------------------

Time: 8:34 AM CT

*Good afternoon, Mr. (REDACTED), you have a scheduled meeting with Mr. Trevor (REDACTED) at 10:30 AM CT in Conference Room C. Please be advised: attendance at this meeting is mandatory and of high priority.*

*THIS MESSAGE IS AN AUTOMATED RESPONSE.*

The email glared across my laptop screen. I stared at it, distracted by the morning’s events playing over and over in my head like a broken record.

*No one else saw anything—not even Randy*, I thought.

I resolved to focus on work. I logged into the system and began my work: three daily safety checks of the entire grid. On a normal day, all sensors read green, signaling everything was running as expected. Occasionally though, a sensor flashed yellow or orange to indicate a minor error, which was logged and addressed by yours truly.

I then noticed sector 7-B was flashing yellow. *Perfect*, I thought. Though annoying, the problem was manageable and quick to resolve.

But then, as if fate had sensed my day wasn’t hard enough, the indicator started flashing red.

Red meant only one thing: *a serious fuck up*. It wasn’t just a problem; *it was my problem*. Red alerts always required immediate on-site attention, and usually, that meant the next twenty-four hours of my life were stuck fixing it.

I groaned, muttering a string of curses under my breath. Any hope of enjoying my night out with Brenna was now gone. I was pissed.

Still, a part of me welcomed the distraction. At least this gave me something worthwhile to focus on instead of the unsettling shit I’d seen earlier.

I left the corporate building and made the short walk over to the massive hangar that housed part of the grid. It was only about ten minutes away, but it felt a lot longer. The campus was sprawling, with four buildings dedicated to the grid and a handful of others for miscellaneous site operations.

When I reached the hangar entrance, I braced myself for what was sure to be an unpleasant encounter. Inside, I found Mike, the lead engineer—or as I often referred to him in my head, *the lead grunt*.

Mike and I didn’t exactly see eye to eye. Our relationship could best be described as… *toxically professional*. Every interaction with him felt like a test from God. He had a habit of pushing back against anything that came from administration—*especially if it came from me*.

The tension between us was fueled by our vastly different backgrounds. Mike was ex-military, a hard-ass with years of experience in various feats of engineering, which included the B-2 (though that was from the rumor mill). He considered my seven years of college a waste of time.

*His favorite line*?

“*You could’ve joined the military, learned everything faster, and fixed your shitty attitude debt free*.”

Technically, as his boss, I could’ve pulled strings to get him fired, but I’d never do it. As much as he annoyed me, Mike was damn good at his job—*one of the best*. Letting him go would’ve been a dumb, emotional move. But that didn’t stop me from occasionally finding ways to get him back, like enrolling him in HR’s behavior management classes.

“Hey, Mike,” I called out, trying to keep my tone normal, “We’ve got a red alert in 7-B.”

He glanced up from whatever he was working on and smirked, “Oh, great. Another problem. What’d you guys do this time?”

*Here we go again*, I thought, already regretting my decision to come here.

“Listen, let’s skip the formalities, you already know I’ll be stuck here for the next twenty-four hours, so don’t go busting my balls here.”

“Relax, don’t get your pretty pink panties in a twist, I already sent a couple of my best down, they’ll be back any minute now.”

Mike paused, a flicker of worry crossing his face before quickly retreating behind his usual demeanor.

“...That was a few minutes ago, and I still haven’t heard a thing,” he finally said, his tone laced with irritation rather than genuine concern.

Mike wasn’t one to care about others either, it seemed, often giving the cold shoulder and even disregarding safety for results. It was something I’d called him out on more times than I could count, but he’d always brushed it off as no big deal.

“I don’t got time for fucking around either, last thing I need is you up my ass even more than it is right now,” he mumbled, as he went back to working on his project.

I bit back my irritation, forcing a neutral tone. “I’m just the messenger, Mike. Let me know what you find when they get back.”

But even as I said it, I was already over it. His constant attitude was grating on me, and I made a mental note to send someone else next time. *Today’s already bad enough without this bullshit*, I thought.

Just as I was walking back to my office to continue on with my day, I heard it—*the sound that marked the beginning of the end.*

Coming from the distance where 7-B was housed, a scream tore through the air, distant but unmistakable. It was *raw, guttural, and filled with such primal terror* that it didn’t even seem human. It froze me in place, my blood running cold. I turned back toward Mike, who was already looking in the direction of Sector 7-B. His expression was unreadable at first, but as the seconds passed, the same fear I was feeling began to creep into his features. He tried to hide it, but it was there, undeniable.

“What the hell?” Mike muttered low and intense.

He took a step forward, then hesitated, his hand clenching into a fist. “I told them not to—” he grumbled angrily, but his words cut off as we both saw it.

Emerging from the direction of Sector 7-B was a person. At first, it was nothing more than a slow-moving silhouette, but then the smell of iron and salt hit my nostrils. I gagged and doubled over at the mere smell of it, causing my stomach to rise into my throat. I caught myself on a workbench as I held back the urge to vomit. *What was that*? The sound of shuffling feet echoed unnervingly and unrhythmic against the cold metal walls. Then, as the figure approached the overhead light that illuminated him, we saw one of the engineers Mike had sent to check the sector appeared…

*At least what was left of him*…

His body was drenched in blood, a gruesome painting of crimson streaks and gore laid out. His left arm was severed cleanly at the shoulder, while his right ended in a jagged stump where his hand should have been, oozing thick, dark fluid. Half of his jaw hung lifeless from one side of his face. Fractured bone and dangling tendons twitched in areas where it had been exposed. Below, he was disemboweled from the sternum down, his innards dragging beneath him. It was coiling around his legs as he staggered forward, nearly tripping on them. His eyes were wide, bloodshot, and glistened with terror, as if he had seen Hell for himself. He staggered forward, driven by sheer will or some desperate instinct to reach safety.

“Holy.. wh-what the fu- wha- ho-” Mike said in a quivering voice.

We just stared at the current reality unraveled before us.

Then, as if flood doors opened, the hangar exploded into chaos. Engineers screamed, scattering like startled birds, while frantic calls for medevac filled the air in the mix. I saw a few sprinting to the nearest Red Phone to place the call.

Mike snapped out of his hypnosis, rushing toward the mangled engineer.

“JESUS FUCKING- BAILEY, we need to get medevac for you, where did the others go?” his voice barely holding together as he looked up and tried calling to the other engineers, “DOES ANYONE SEE THE OTHERS?!”

He whipped around to face me, his expression a mix of terror and urgency.

“Go and get one of the guards, tell them to radio this in and to lock down the hangar” Mike barked to me as I stood there.

His voice broke my trance. I nodded and turned to run, ready to call in a *Code Purple*.

Hangar employees began to creep towards the hallway leading to Sector 7-B, their faces held with dread. A few dared to step in, their movements slow and deliberate, as if trying not to provoke something unseen.

Then a faint sound interrupted us as it drifted from deeper inside Sector 7-B—*whistling*.

But it wasn’t normal. Something was wrong with it. The tune was off, *warped, inhuman*. A haunting, disjointed version of *Yankee Doodle* echoed through the air, its cadence crawling under my skin.

The PA system kicked on with the accompaniment of red-blaring sirens buzzing throughout the place, jump-scaring everyone, including me.

The robotic voice began its repeating message.

“*This is an emergency broadcast alert, please remain calm and find a place of secure shelter. Protocol 999 will be taking place. Do not let anyone into facilities, lock all doors, and close all blinds until the conclusion of this broadcast. If you are outside, seek immediate shelter. This is an emerge*\-”

I turned back to Mike, my heart pounding in my chest. The fear in his eyes mirrored my own. And then the whistling came again—*louder* than before. It was threading its way through the screams, alarms, and the general, frantic chaos around us. The warped *Yankee Doodle* grew closer.

I grabbed Mike’s shoulder, “We need to get out of here!” I shouted, realizing whatever that was, couldn’t be good.

“Bailey is in no shape to move right now!” his voice horse and panic-stricken.

“Mike, we have to go, we can’t take him—*not like this*!”

He hesitated, torn between survival and loyalty. We both knew the truth—*Bailey was beyond saving*. Even if a medevac arrived in time, how could anyone save someone who’d been so gruesomely ripped apart like this?

Mike made his decision. He knelt beside Bailey, whispering something in his ear. I couldn’t hear the words, but I saw his lips tremble. A single tear slid down his face before he noticed me watching. He wiped it away quickly, and then stood and turned to me, his face hardening.

“Let’s go!”

I bolted towards the entrance, Mike close in pursuit. Around us, others fled in a panic, some ahead of us, others trailing behind. The chaos of the hangar spilled out into the open as we ran, but the sound of that unnatural whistling followed us, growing with every step no matter how far we ran in the opposite direction.

We made it to the entrance with no problem. As we did so, we heard more violent screams erupting from behind us. We turned back and saw limbs from various people thrown into the air. In front of us rushed armed security, military personnel, and other trained professionals responding to the incident inside.

Just then Mike turned to me, “Where are we going?”

I had no idea what to do now. To be honest, I thought about just leaving him and booking it towards my car to get the hell out of this place. However, I knew the entrance to get in or out was locked down during *Protocol 999*.

I glanced over to the gate and saw the same scene being played out as it was from behind us.

*There was no escape now*.

“Let’s head to my office” I said.

We had about a couple minutes worth of running, however, our prime years of athletic endurance were far behind us. If only I had just used that six-month membership to our local gym that work had provided for free annually…

Just as it felt like my heart would explode, I spotted somewhere to hide and pointed to Mike to rest there. We hid in the hedges, hoping the thick cover of brush would hide our location from any impending danger.

As I’m writing this, we are still hiding. I tried calling 911 and they told me to sit tight as they tried to contact federal support as they had no jurisdiction on our property. Hopefully, help would get here sooner than later.

I looked up after a moment and noticed Mike sitting there with a thousand-yard stare glued to the nearest rock he saw on the ground. His appearance sunk in sadness, instead of shock like mine. It was something I wasn’t familiar with seeing from him. After all, this guy was made of bricks, physically and emotionally.

Just as I was about to check on him, a piercing scream erupted nearby, cutting through me like a knife. Mike broke his locked gaze and whipped his head toward me. Before either of us could process what to do, more agonizing wails tore through the air behind us—*closer this time*. Ten feet, maybe less.

Then, sickening noises replaced the screams—*tearing flesh, snapping tendons, and the squelch* of something unknown happening nearby. Each sound burrowed into my brain, leaving scars I knew would never heal.

Silence fell hard. Not comforting either—it was heavy with anticipation for what would happen next. My body felt weak, trembling. We sat frozen, wide-eyed and pale. Neither of us spoke, too paralyzed to even form a thought. The bushes weren’t safe. *We had to move*.

I was about to suggest the idea when Mike seemed to make his own decision. Slowly, he leaned forward and parted the dense shrubbery, just enough to peek through. His movements were deliberate, and careful, trying to remain unseen by whatever might be out there. I watched as his expression shifted. At first, it was confusion. Then his face went entirely still, his breath caught, and he moved back while the brush fell back into place.

“What’s wrong?” I whispered just loud enough so he could hear me, but he just sat there.

Concerned I spoke up a little louder.

“Mike... Mike, you gotta talk to me here man. What’s going on out there? Is it that bad?”

Finally, he spoke, his voice eerily calm,

The best things in Panama City Beach are free.
The sound of the tide before sunrise.
The soft hum of a place waking up.
A seat by the window, watching people come and go.
A door that swings open, but never quite closes.

Some come here for a weekend.
Some stay for a season.
Some stay longer than they meant to.

A bike ride to St. Andrew’s.
Same path, same view, but the feeling is different.
Some go looking, hoping.
Some forget why they came.
Some forget they had a choice at all.

A soft whimper of a dog when they see you.
The kind of sound that lingers after you’re gone.

The smell of coffee, warm and familiar.
Not mine, but always there.
I never stayed long. Maybe I should have. Maybe I wasn’t supposed to.
Some faces stay with you even when you try to forget them.

Same stories and same open roads with waves nearby.
Some come for comfort.
Some come because it’s the only thing they’ve ever known.
Some come to see if something is still waiting for them.

Panama City Beach is like a missed call.
Some numbers stay in the log, unanswered.
Some messages never get sent.
Some signals don’t disappear—they just wait.

Some places hold onto people.
Some people hold onto places.
Some only leave when they realize they were never really free.

The dunes shift. The waves erase footprints.
That doesn’t mean they were never there.

Some moments stay.
Some decisions make themselves.
Some doors were never meant to stay open forever.

About me:
🦖 I never grew out of my dinosaur phase and will absolutely judge movies for their inaccurate depictions of prehistoric creatures.
🎭 Cosplay is my passion—half my wardrobe is historical or sci-fi-inspired, and I regret nothing.
📖 I write romance, because even in a world of dragons, spaceships, and time travel, love makes everything more interesting.
⚡ Marvel, fantasy, and sci-fi are my lifeblood. Doctor Who, Star Wars, Star Trek—why choose when you can obsess over them all?
🎲 I’ve been the Forever DM for years, which means I can craft love stories between NPCs but have yet to find my own.
☕ My perfect weekend? Writing about star-crossed lovers, reading about lost civilizations, and drowning in coffee.

Why am I here?
Aside from the fact that my main conversations lately have been with fictional characters, I’d love to meet people who geek out over the same things I do. If you’re the kind of person who has strong opinions on which sci-fi romance is the best (Han & Leia? The Doctor & Rose?), let’s talk.

**The Multidimensional Timeline Hypothesis: A Framework for Free Will in a 4D Universe**

**Core Idea:**  
To reconcile the ""fixed slices"" of time (the fourth dimension) with free will, we propose a **fifth dimension** that represents *all possible timelines* branching from every decision. This dimension allows for dynamic ""navigation"" through alternate futures, even within a universe where time itself is structured like a series of predetermined moments (the ""bread slices"").

**The Analogy:**  
1. **The 4D Universe (Bread Slices):**  
   Imagine time as a loaf of bread, where each slice represents a static 3D moment (your ""now""). From a purely fourth-dimensional perspective, all slices already exist—past, present, and future are fixed. This is the classic ""block universe"" model.  

2. **The Problem of Free Will:**  
   If time is just a sequence of pre-cut slices, our choices might feel like illusions—as if we’re passively riding a filmstrip. This clashes with our subjective experience of agency.  

3. **Introducing the Fifth Dimension (Shifting the Bread):**  
   Now, imagine the entire loaf (all of time) can shift *sideways* along a fifth dimension. This movement doesn’t alter the loaf itself, but changes *which slice you align with* as you move forward through time.  
   - **Your choices act as ""steering mechanisms"":** Each decision nudges you laterally into a slightly different ""track"" of pre-existing slices (alternate timelines).  
   - **Radical decisions = bigger shifts:** Mundane choices (e.g., drinking coffee vs. tea) create minor lateral adjustments, while life-altering decisions (e.g., moving to a new country) ""jump"" you to a distant track, altering your perceived future.  

4. **Why This Resolves Paradoxes:**  
   - **No time travel needed:** The past isn’t rewritten; you’re simply navigating parallel timelines. A ""time machine"" would shift you laterally to access slices from other tracks.  
   - **Free will preserved:** Your choices matter—they determine which timeline you experience, even if all timelines exist ""eternally"" in the fifth dimension.  

**Key Takeaway:**  
Time (4D) is fixed, but the fifth dimension introduces *contingency*. Like a train switching tracks, your agency lies in steering toward one set of slices over others. The future isn’t a single path—it’s a spectrum of possibilities you navigate via decisions.

---

**Why This Works:**  
- It retains the physics-friendly block universe model while accommodating free will.  
- It avoids paradoxes (e.g., killing your grandfather just shifts you to a timeline where he died earlier).  
- It aligns with quantum interpretations where probabilities collapse into one timeline (your ""horizontal position"" in the fifth dimension).  

This framework reframes time travel as *timeline travel* and positions free will as the mechanism by which we explore the fifth dimension’s branching paths.",2,1739676693.0,teenarazzi,3,1.0,False

They will go on to describe how younger them was late, and maybe she ordered something very low cal to drink, and she was insecure, etc etc. and they’ll proceed to contrast it with their current self. Everyone doing this trend is posting from a place of personal growth, and things will get better. They have families now, wonderful partners, they feel confident and good about themselves.
And it’s honestly been so depressing…
I feel like I’ve failed every version of younger me.
I feel like she’d show up so hopeful to see how I turn out… and I think current me would spare her the agony and I’d probably stand up the coffee date.
She would be so disappointed. I’m not with the partner I lived with for 6 years and planned to marry. I’m still anorexic. I’m still broke. I’m still all of the things I’ve always struggled with, and I’ve only added on more problems along the way.

I just have to keep telling myself that there is a version of me in the future who will not let this “younger me” down. Someday I’ll be her. I’ll catch up to everyone who is doing better and is growing.

I just started a part time job at a cafe near a pretty busy part of the city and there are tons of malls and stores within walking distance of this cafe. It's a service job where we serve coffee and pastries. Business has been kinda slow so there are stretches of time where we just sit around and do nothing but scroll on our phones.

A few days ago, the barista that works with me remembered that she had a dinner to go to that night and needed to quickly get an outfit for it. Before she left, she pulled a few shots of espresso for me just in case any customers were wanting coffee because I don't know how to make espresso. Most customers usually get iced drinks which are pretty easy to make and I generally know how to handle the orders. So I was fine without her for awhile.

So she went looking for her clothes in a mall that's like a 5 minute walk away. It was pretty uneventful when she was gone except when someone came to deliver coins for the cash register. She should have been there to collect it but I collected it on her behalf. I accidentally let slip that she went to buy something to the guy delivering it. He took a picture of me as proof that the coins were received by me and he left.

The barista didn't end up purchasing anything as she had left her wallet at home so I went during my lunch break to buy it for her and she paid me back. 

The other coworker that is more like the manager of this cafe made a comment about the delivery of the coins while the barista was in the washroom and I didn't deny the lie. I also didn't mention that went to the mall. 

The manager and the barista were actually pretty close friends but I think had a falling out because of the business issues so they have a strained relationship. It's very awkward when the three of us have a shift together as they don't speak and I feel stuck in the middle. 

The manager messaged me today asking if the barista when to the mall and whether she purchased anything meant for the cafe or was it for personal reasons. She was told by the delivery guy that the barista went to the mall. 

I don't know what to do. I don't want to lie and I also don't want to put the barista in hot water because that might affect our relationship. I like both the manager and barista and I just want to work in a environment without all this drama. It feels like I am stuck in between.

Just my two morning Cokes and the will to survive another day in this hellscape of a hospital. But today, I woke up feeling like I lost a street fight to a raccoon and needed something stronger.

So I tell my med student, “Hey, grab me some coffee.” Easy request, right? Foolproof.

WRONG.

I take one sip. Something tastes off. Not in a “this is cheap hospital sludge” way, but in a “my soul just left my body and is now playing hopscotch with demons” way. But rounds wait for no man, so I brush it off.

Then it starts.

I see movement. At first, I think it’s just my sleep deprivation manifesting as friendly hallucinations (standard Tuesday). But no. Suddenly, I can see the concept of time. I hear the walls whispering. Elves are giggling in the corner. Ants are performing an elaborate musical number on my forearms.

I turn to my med student. This dude is suspiciously calm. Too calm. Did he drug me? Is this an assassination attempt? Am I about to become a case study in JAMA: “When the Attending Gets Sent on a Spirit Journey”?

I storm down the hallway, absolutely vibrating with newfound energy, convinced I’m either about to unlock the secrets of the universe or dissolve into pure consciousness. I poke this kid in the chest and bellow, “WHAT DID YOU PUT IN MY COFFEE?”

And this poor soul who, in retrospect, looks just as confused as I feel starts stammering about how he just poured it from the nurses’ station. So I march back over there, rip open the coffee pot lid, and I swear to God, I make eye contact with something sentient.

This thing is ALIVE. It is thriving. There is an entire fungal civilization growing in this pot. I expect it to ask me for my hospital ID. The stench alone should be classified as a biohazard.

Realizing that I may have just ingested matured penicillin stew, I bolt back to my med student, tell him he’s done for the day (before I hallucinate him into another plane of existence), and vow to have a very interesting conversation with my PD on Monday.

Anyway, moral of the story: check your damn coffee pot, or you too might end up seeing elves and vibrating through dimensions before morning rounds.",74,1739676247.0,medicalschool,3,0.93,False

He’s a recovered addict and he gave his life to Christ after experiencing God in the worst time of his life - his testimony is incredible and God has been using him in so many different ways.

I told the guy that if it’s from God I won’t be opposed to it but I’m definitely not ready for anything now and I need to fast and pray on the situation myself. The reason I’m not ready is because I’ve just come out of a relationship (which this guy knows about) and because I’m not too encouraged by the idea of this guy since he doesn’t meet my worldly standards - he’s unemployed, has mental health issues and his family are very chaotic and I didn’t know whether I want that or if I need to let go of these standards. He took that as a yes I’m completely interested and started to tell everyone at church me and him are dating. Not even 24 hours after this convo, he started to flirt with me, said he wanted to kiss me and then started telling me I should change my hair colour and asked me if I would ever get a boob job. 

I told him to stop and slow down, he’s moving too fast and we should just stay as friends which led to our first argument 24 hours after the conversation. I placed my boundaries and he seemed to understand. Turns out he didn’t understand and continued to do all the things I told him to not do. I ended up just telling him straight without being too nice and he took it as a personal insult, held resentment against me for 3 days and then told me I was berating him and made him think of relapsing. Ever since I was just put off him as an individual and didn’t want to consider him as anything in my life anymore. I did apologise to maintain the peace and we sorted it out over message but now he literally won’t leave me alone and keeps bringing God up in the middle of it and also trying to guilt trip me by saying people always leave him and ditch him.

He’s been insisting to meet up for coffee to sort it out and to go back to the friendship we had but my family won’t allow me to go on a coffee one on one with a guy I’m not dating and I wouldn’t allow myself either. I don’t want to sort things out anymore but he won’t leave me alone. I want to block him but everyone keeps telling me it’s petty and insensitive due to the things he’s dealt with.

I grew up reading my older brother's collection of all the original books and have wanted to buy my own set of the collector's edition for a long time. Today I finally got it - from a special location: the bookstore next to the Chagrin Falls Popcorn Shop. For those who don't know - Chagrin Falls is Bill Watterson's hometown, and on the back cover of *The Essential Calvin and Hobbes* is an illustration of giant Calvin destroying downtown Chagrin Falls and picking up this Popcorn Shop specifically. (And yes, a copy of that illustration is hanging on the wall inside lol).

I moved to the Cleveland area a few years ago and when I realized Bill Watterson's hometown was nearby (plus being told it was a nice place to visit anyway), I put it on my bucket list, but couldn't get out there for a long time because I didn't have a car. I finally got out there last October and after discovering that the bookstore right beside the Popcorn Shop of course had a ""local authors"" section stacked with every *Calvin and Hobbes* book, I decided that's where I'd eventually purchase my collector's edition. I made it out there for the second time today and purchased my copy - plus some popcorn.

Bonus story: About a year ago, I still didn't have a car, and had a job interview on the other side of town. Long story short, after some public transportation snafus, it ended up that the best way for me to get to my interview on time was to take the train to the end of the line to the airport and then get an Uber from there. The Uber driver naturally assumed that I had just flown in, and I was too tired/irritated and nervous about my interview to explain, so I just went with it and pretended I had flown in from my hometown for an interview. The driver was very nice and he proceeded to tell me all the best places in Cleveland I could visit if I had time and then told me his hometown was a place called Chagrin Falls and asked if I'd ever heard of it. I said, ""Of course, it's where Bill Watterson is from"". He then burst out laughing and said he'd never had anyone respond that they knew Chagrin Falls because it's where Bill Watterson was from. (This surprised me to be honest, I figured he's the town's best claim to fame). I told him I was a big fan of *Calvin and Hobbes* and then he told me, ""I actually just saw Bill the other week!"" and reached over to his passenger seat and passed me a bag of popcorn from the shop. He said he'd picked that up yesterday, but that he'd seen Bill in the shop a few weeks ago. He said that he'd known Bill Watterson his whole life, as close family friends, because his grandmother had been Bill's high school English teacher, and his uncle had gone to school with him and worked with him for a few years. Then he said I could keep the bag of popcorn as a gift, and that next time he saw Bill he'd tell him, ""I met a fan who knew you were from Chagrin Falls"". I responded, ""He might not like that"" lol.

Anyway, that interaction lifted my mood considerably and I did well in the interview and ended up getting the job offer (although I didn't take it for other reasons). I've wanted to share that story on here for a while, so I hope it provided some entertainment! :) Unfortunately, I myself have not run into Bill Watterson either time I have gone into the Popcorn Shop 😂",13,1739675979.0,calvinandhobbes,2,1.0,False

I don't know what to do. I don't want to lie and I also don't want to put the barista in hot water because that might affect our relationship. I like both the manager and barista and I just want to work in a environment without all this drama. It feels like I am stuck in between.

I’ve spoken to him a good amount of times but just small talk. Today I told him he looked nice in the color he was wearing, partially because he totally caught me looking at him for way too long. 🤦‍♀️ 
A mutual friend/coworker told me that (let’s call him, Collin) the sweetest guy I’ve ever met’s dad is in prison for murdering his step grandfather. So one day I looked up the court transcripts, and I find out that it was allegedly because the step grandfather was molesting the sweetest guy I’ve ever met… it was stated that he said he wasn’t molested, but idk.. I told another co worker that I had a big ole crush on the sweetest guy I’ve ever met, and after I told her NO DONT SAY ANYTHING, she goes and asks him if he wanted to have coffee with me. I was mortified, and I wasn’t able to look him in the eye for weeks. (He said no, btw) and I’m not entirely sure why, but I’m assuming because he thinks I was too chicken shit to ask him myself, which I WAS going to.. maybe. But anyway, the sweetest guy I’ve ever met is so cute, and sweet, and adorable, and nothing like the guys I’ve dated before. (I’m notorious for dating assholes). And I just think he would be perfect, basically because he is…ugh. But in a busy restaurant work environment I don’t know what to say or how to say it not to sound like a weirdo.. plus idk why he said no to begin with.. I AM cute, I promise. lol so idk what to do. I thought about texting him since his number is on the schedule, but that would be creepy probably… so idk, what should I do? ",6,1739675934.0,dating_advice,3,0.88,False

First off, I just want to say thank you to everyone who has supported me through this. I didn’t expect my post to get so much attention, and honestly, I needed some time to process everything before updating. Things have been… a lot. But I do have some good news.

So, after the whole coffee incident, I decided to go no contact with my mother. At first, I thought that would be the end of it, but I was wrong. She kept trying to reach out—calling from different numbers, sending me long, guilt-trippy emails, even showing up at my apartment. The first time, she banged on my door for nearly an hour, switching between sobbing and screaming about how I was “tearing the family apart.” The second time, she waited for me outside my job. She grabbed my arm before I could walk past her and started whisper-yelling about how ungrateful I was and how everything she did was for me. My manager had to step in and ask her to leave. After that, I blocked every possible way she could contact me.

Then, somehow, she found out about my Reddit post. I have no idea how, because I didn’t think it was that popular, and I never shared it outside of here. But one day, I got a text from an unknown number with a screenshot of my own post and a message saying, “This is how you treat family?” Then another one: “You have no idea what you’ve done.”

That’s when she really lost it. She sent me a bunch of messages about how I “humiliated” her, how I made her look like a monster, how I was ruining her reputation. But not once did she acknowledge that any of this was her fault. Not once did she say sorry. It was all about how I made her look bad, not about how she actually was bad.

That was my breaking point. I changed my locks just in case, blocked her on everything, and fully cut contact. And I don’t regret it.

But now for something good—my sister has actually come around.

At first, she acted like I was being dramatic and told me to “get over it.” That hurt more than I expected because deep down, I had hoped she’d understand. But a few days after I blocked our mother, she reached out again. This time, she actually apologized. She admitted that she was scared of facing the truth and that it was easier for her to push me away than to acknowledge how messed up everything was. She told me she regretted how she acted and that she wants to rebuild our relationship.

And honestly? I believe her. She’s been making an effort. We’ve been meeting up, just the two of us, having real conversations. She’s finally acknowledging what happened and how it affected me. It’s not perfect, and we still have a lot to work through, but it’s a start.

Through all of this, Daniel (not his real name) has been my rock. He never forced me to talk, never tried to “fix” me—just held me when I needed it and gave me space when I didn’t. One night, I finally told him everything. And instead of giving me some deep, philosophical answer, he just looked at me and said, “You don’t have to carry this alone.” And I think that’s when it really hit me.

Family isn’t just the people you’re born to. It’s the people who show up. The ones who stand by you even when things get ugly. And I may have lost my relationship with my mother, but I’m gaining something real with my sister. And I have people in my life who actually care.

So, where do I go from here? I don’t know. But for the first time in a long time, I feel like I have a future worth looking forward to.

And to anyone who might be in a similar situation—you don’t have to keep hurting just because someone is “family.” You deserve peace. You deserve love. And you deserve people who actually want to be in your life.

Thank you again to everyone who has supported me. You don’t know how much it means.",1,1739675817.0,u_itwasaaccidentt,0,1.0,False

I’m 34F and ready for something serious and long-term. I’m a career-driven, ambitious person who’s passionate about what I do, but I’m also looking for someone to share the good moments life has to offer.

A little about me: I’m a consultant, which means I travel a lot for work. It’s a big part of my life, so I’m hoping to find someone who’s cool with that setup. I’m based in the Philippines but travel a lot  across Asia, USA, and I’ll be in Europe for a few weeks this year. Or, if we get to a point where we’re really clicking, maybe you can be my plus one on some of my travels!  I have asthma, so I prefer to date non-smokers, and I drink occasionally. I love going out, dressing up for concerts, and just enjoying life. I’m looking for someone who has their life together and is stable, just like me.

I can be a little stubborn (a bit of a workaholic at times), but I’m also someone who’s very loyal and caring when I find the right person. I can get  clingy not in a dramatic way!) when I feel comfortable with someone, so I hope you’re okay with that.

Physically, i'm a tiny bean standing 5'2, curvy  in all the right places and takes working out seriously. 

I’m looking for someone who is headstrong, ambitious, and big on communication and honesty – someone who can be gentle and caring, but also assertive when needed. I want someone I can build something real and meaningful with. I don’t mind whether it’s online or long-term right away, as long as we both have the understanding that if things go well, we’ll eventually close the distance (or whatever the next step is). I prefer someone taller than me, average to athletic build, good hygiene, independent and manly man mindset. 😉 

If this sounds like something that could work for you, send me a message with a little about yourself, what you do, and a photo.

I will be in Rowland Heights next week and would be awesome to meet for a chat or coffee, maybe a stroll after my meetings!

1iqix5g,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1iqix5g/21m_here_after_a_rough_few_years_how_do_i_rebuild/,"21m here after a rough few years, how do I rebuild and achieve small wins?","Hello,

I just discovered this subreddit in search of advice I am desperately seeking. I am a 21M and have had a really rough past 3-4 years. It mostly started when I broke up with my girlfriend of 4 years in 2022 and my drug use increased exponentially. I'm trying not to make this a whole 'life post' so I mostly want to cover the 'now' but some details are necessary. I was basically a straight 'A' student admitted into a extremely prestigious university for engineering but my crashing mental health hit a bottom. I abused many hard drugs including (and mainly) alcohol, weed, opiates, and psychedelics. Failed out of school in a semester and floundered around for a couple years making just enough money to get high and live.

I got out of rehab in December and was sober for 6 months. Had a little slip with weed one day in January but got right back on the train and am now sober for 1 month and I really have no craving to use. I now live in a sober house. I am in community college (all online classes) now doing 15 credits and work a part time job 30 hours a week. While I am working on myself with school and work, my self-care is very bad and I don't really know where to start to fix it. For general reference when I was 16 I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder (Severe), Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. I also had an episode of drug-induced psychosis in 2022 which I was hospitalized in the psych unit for 11 days.

I do well in work and school but I really enjoy school so its a good outlet.

My average day is: Go to work (wake up 4:45am for 5:30am shift), get home usually around 10-1 with a fast food meal depending on the day, do school work until 8-9pm then sleep around 10-11pm. On days I have off I usually wake up whenever, grab a cup of coffee, work on school until around 7-8pm, eat a meal, then lay in bed until I fall asleep around 10pm-12am. I usually quite literally do nothing else besides school and work besides the occasional shower, meal, or YouTube break.

My main problem is I think of all these things I need to work on and I feel paralyzed. I have tried improving before but did a very much 'all or nothing' approach. Being extremely exhausted from school and work adds to it too. Today I set a small goal of brushing my teeth in the morning and at night for a week and I'm going to see if I can do that.

I find a lot of my stress comes from simply living life, going to work, and doing school, as well as these bad self-care habits. Also, since I am extremely shy, small, bad looking, and generally unkempt/disgusting I am a very easy target at work and home with roommates and coworkers and I really often get picked on and bullied. This just makes my mental health worse.

My main goal in life is to marry someone I truly love and go to school hopefully to get a PhD in something I really enjoy. But these things are not at all achievable with how I live. I also really like music, art, outdoors, and hunting. Hunting was my biggest hobby from 12-17ish but I'm no longer trusted with guns so I am not allowed to hunt anymore.

Any advice on things that helped you?

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some things I'd like to work on is:

\* Get on and consistently take psych medication (I have a history of not taking meds). I'd like to not have suicidal thoughts from morning-night.

\* I am extremely closed off, people don't know how bad I am struggling with self-care because of shame and trust issues (like parents, therapists, friends).

\* Washing my clothes so I'm not wearing dirty clothes

\* Brushing my teeth everyday. I am in constant mouth pain from TMJ, grinding, and bad oral hygeine.

\* Showering everyday

\* Eating 2-3 meals a day, I eat probably around 600-1200 cals a day because I don't have motivation to cook and my appetite is really bad. I usually eat a small/medium fast food meal once a day. Some days I will gorge and eat \~3000 calories a day in junk.

\* Getting physically active, I really like the idea of lifting weights and getting stronger, and also being flexible and running

\* Stopping vaping/smoking/dipping

\* Better sleep hygiene

\* Better budgeting. I have +$1500 in credit card debt that I am desperately trying to pay off but a lot of my money goes to fast food as I don't have motivation to cook. I have been better about it though and have paid off $500 in the past month.

\* Treat my skin

\* Being generally cleaner

\* Being a generally better person. Less anxious, depressed, and irratible.

\* Stop being extremely shy and timid

\* Invest in myself via hobbies, more educated media (not stupid YouTube and video games), and life experiences.

That means the menu is primarily red meat and alcohol. It’s always the same routine. I spend the day happily walking around town, grabbing food and eventually settling-in for a movie night at my house. I live by the upper Mississippi River, very near the Wisconsin-Illinois-Iowa border (close to Canada). That’s important, because we’re going through a snow storm. I’ve had to shovel my property 5 times in the past 3 days.

The day went down without a hitch. I got my first mile in early, grabbing a sugary breakfast and coffee at the grocery store. After the 4th snow clearing, I was sweaty and sore, but ready for the 3 mile round trip to the burger joint and back. Everything went great! I got some chicken nuggets to feed to some neighborhood dogs along my route, drank a malt liquor cooler as I went. I picked up a frozen pepperoni pizza for a late dinner, and arrived home. Bingo bango, all done. I drank 2 more malt liquor coolers (pineapple strawberry lemonade), and watched 2010’s *The Nightmare on Elm Street* remake (meh) and *The Cult of Chucky* (it was pretty good). Pizza time!

I cooked the pizza, and decided to have shots of tequila. The tequila sits on my Santa Muerte altar, and I made sure to share with the Boney Lady. All good. The night felt young, so I put on another movie. *Guardians of the Galaxy vol 3* was… not that compelling. It felt like a kid’s movie, and I started getting sleepy. I konked out before it finished… and when I woke up… all signs pointed to a mild hangover… until I decided to snow shovel again.

I finished shoveling around noon, and my soreness was catching up to me. My shoulders, dude. I’d been drinking V8 and coffee since I woke up, but this hangover… it was **ramping** ***UP***! After laying on the floor in my living room, I moaned some motivation into my bones and made a pot of veggie stew. Mushrooms, rice, spinach, kidney beans, black beans, tomatoes, ginger and cumin broth, a little pepper… that did the trick. *Finally*, the acetaminophen in my system kicked in, and the pain radiating up from my back stopped fueling my headache.

It was all good… until… *the farts*. Oh… my… god, the farts, dude. Thunderous, cacophonous, waistline-shrinking farts. Where are this many blasts coming from? How is this physically possible?!

 I have 2 female cats, and they like to stick close to me. After that sugary breakfast at the store? I came back with a treat for each of them. The pepperoni pizza? You can bet my oldest girl got herself some cheese. Laying on my living room floor? My back was made into muffins. Now, here I am, lying in bed, trying to relax as my littlest girl curls up under the covers, hugging my leg.

We built a general friendship through dancing with one another multiple times an event and chatting. After about a year of getting to know him I realized how much I liked him. I admitted the feelings to myself and started to convince myself that maybe he could feel the same way. We are very similar, he is easy to talk to and makes me laugh, we have great connection through dance, we feel very compatible in a-lot of ways without getting into details.

I finally worked up the courage three months ago to ask him on a date. He agreed and we got coffee and chatted for a few hours. It was amazing and I felt so hopeful for this new connection/development in our friendship. I seriously felt/feel a great connection with him. We brushed knees as we sat and flirted, it felt really good! At the end of the date I just said “I really like you and would like to do this again. But don’t feel any pressure because I don’t want to make our friendship weird” and he replied “oh yea definitely, I’m just really busy right now so I’ll get back to you” 

I saw him at another dance after (right before the holidays) and things seemed normal and a little deeper. But then when I sat with him at the break things felt really weird, his body language was closed and just off (I think he was trying to send a quiet message that he wasn’t interested). Long story short he never contacted me again for a date but we see eachother ALL the time. And he’s such a kind person that he hasn’t made me feel bad or awkward in our interactions. It’s like everything was before the date and my admission. 

My friends say it was unkind of him to not give me an explanation or response. But I think it was his way to avoid hurting my feelings and our friendship. He knows I’m pretty sensitive and I think he truly does  care about me as a person. He’s a wonderful person. 

The problem is, I see him SO OFTEN, and the more time I spend with him the more these feelings linger. I can’t cut him out because we have so many mutual friends and it’s impossible to avoid him at social gatherings. I mean his sister takes a class I take. He didn’t do anything wrong anyways so it feels weird trying to avoid him at all costs. It’s not his fault he doesn’t like me romantically. 

I just don’t know what to do. I know these feelings/this connection will never go away completely but I just wish I could move it all back from before I realized I liked him. When we were still just only friends. I just like him so much it makes me stomach in knots when I think that he doesn’t reciprocate. I’ll never know why and I don’t want to know why. I just want to move on. I just want these feelings to go away. I feel crazy.

1iqis3r,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTales/comments/1iqis3r/emergency_alert_fall_asleep_before_10_pm_the/,Emergency Alert : Fall asleep before 10 PM | The Bedtime Signal,"I used to think bedtime was just a routine—something we all had to do, a simple part of life like eating or brushing your teeth. Every night, it was the same: wash my face, change into pajamas, climb into bed, and turn off the lights. Nothing special. Nothing to be afraid of. If anything, bedtime was boring, a mindless transition from one day to the next.

But that was before the emergency alerts started.

It began last week, just a little after 9:50 PM. I was lounging in bed, lazily scrolling through my tablet, half-watching some video I wasn’t even paying attention to. The night felt normal, quiet, the kind of stillness that settles after a long day. But then, out of nowhere, every single screen in my room flickered at once. My tablet. My phone. Even the small digital clock on my nightstand. The glow of their displays pulsed strangely, like they were struggling to stay on. A faint crackling sound filled the air, like the buzz of static on an old TV.

Then, the emergency broadcast cut through the silence. The voice was robotic, unnatural, crackling with distortion.

***""This is an emergency alert. At exactly 10:00 PM, all electronic devices will emit The Bedtime Signal. You must be in bed with your eyes closed before the signal begins. Those who remain awake and aware will be taken.""***

The message repeated twice, each word pressing into my brain like a weight. Then, without warning, the screen on my tablet went black. My phone, too. Even the digital clock stopped glowing, leaving the room eerily dim. A moment later, everything powered back on, as if nothing had happened. No error messages. No explanation. Just back to normal.

At first, I thought it had to be some kind of elaborate prank. Maybe a weird internet hoax or some kind of system glitch. But something about it didn’t feel right. The voice had been too… deliberate. Too cold.

Then I heard my mom’s voice from down the hall.

""Alex! Time for bed!""

She sounded urgent—too urgent. This wasn’t her usual half-distracted reminder before she went to bed herself. There was an edge to her voice, a sharpness that made my stomach twist. I swung my legs off the bed and peeked out of my room.

Down the hallway, I saw her and my dad moving quickly. My mom was locking the front door, double-checking the deadbolt with shaking fingers. My dad was yanking cords out of the wall, unplugging the TV, the microwave, even the Wi-Fi router. It wasn’t normal bedtime behavior. It was like they were preparing for a storm.

""What’s going on?"" I asked, my voice small.

They both looked up at me, and the fear in their eyes hit me like a punch to the chest. My dad stepped forward, his face grim.

""Don’t stay up past ten,"" he said, his voice tight. ""No matter what you hear.""

I wanted to ask more, to demand answers, but something in their expressions stopped me cold. Whatever was happening, it was real. And it was dangerous.

I went back to my room, my parents' warning still fresh in my mind. I didn’t know what was happening, but their fear had seeped into me, wrapping around my chest like invisible vines. Swallowing hard, I slid under the covers, pulling the blanket up to my chin as if it could somehow protect me.

I checked the time. **9:59 PM.**

One minute.

The air felt heavier, thicker, like the room itself was holding its breath. Then, I heard it.

At first, it was so faint I almost thought I was imagining it. A whisper—so soft, so distant, like someone murmuring from the farthest corner of the house. But then, the sound grew louder, rising from my phone. It wasn’t a notification chime or a ringtone. It was… wrong. A high-pitched, eerie hum that sent a ripple of cold down my spine. My tablet buzzed with the same noise. So did my alarm clock. My laptop, even though it was powered off. Every screen. Every speaker. Every single electronic device in my room was playing it.

The sound wasn’t just noise. It was *alive.*

And underneath it… something else.

A voice.

It was buried beneath the hum, layered so deep I could barely hear it, but it was there. Whispering. Speaking in a language I didn’t understand. The words slithered through the noise, soft but insistent, like they were meant just for me.

I wanted to listen.

Something about it pulled at me, like a hook digging into my mind, reeling me in. My heartbeat pounded in my ears, my fingers curled against the sheets. If I focused, maybe—just maybe—I could understand what it was saying.

But then my dad’s warning echoed in my head.

***""No matter what you hear.""***

I clenched my jaw, shut my eyes, and forced myself to stay still. My body was tense, every muscle screaming at me to move, to run, to do *something*. But I stayed frozen, gripping the blankets like they were my last lifeline.

Then, just as suddenly as it had started… it stopped.

Silence.

I didn’t open my eyes right away. I lay there, listening, waiting for something—*anything*—to happen. But there was nothing. No more whispers. No more hum. The room felt normal again, but I wasn’t fooled.

Eventually, exhaustion won. I drifted off, my body giving in to sleep.

The next morning, I woke up to sunlight streaming through my window, birds chirping outside like it was just another ordinary day. My tablet was right where I left it. My phone showed no weird notifications. The world kept moving like nothing had happened.

But I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was *wrong*.

That night, at exactly 9:50 PM, the emergency alert returned.

*""This is an emergency alert. At exactly 10:00 PM, all electronic devices will emit The Bedtime Signal. You must be in bed with your eyes closed before the signal begins. Those who remain awake and aware will be taken.""*

The same robotic voice. The same crackling static. The same uneasy feeling creeping over my skin.

I watched as my parents rushed through the house, their movements identical to the night before—checking locks, closing blinds, making sure everything was unplugged. My mom’s hands trembled as she turned off the lights. My dad barely spoke, his jaw tight.

But tonight, something inside me was different.

I wasn’t as scared.

I was *curious*.

I wanted to know why.

What was The Bedtime Signal? What would happen if I didn’t close my eyes? Who—*or what*—was speaking beneath the hum?

So when the clock struck ten, and the eerie hum filled my room again, I didn’t shut my eyes right away.

I *listened*.

The whispering was clearer this time. The words still didn’t make sense, but they sounded closer, like whoever—or *whatever*—was speaking had moved toward me. My skin prickled, my breaths shallow.

Then, from somewhere beneath my bed, the wooden frame creaked.

I stiffened.

A single thought echoed in my head: *I’m not alone.*

I held my breath, my heart hammering against my ribs. Slowly, cautiously, I turned my head just enough to see the edge of my blanket. The whispering grew louder, pressing against my ears like cold fingers.

And then—

A hand slid out from the darkness under my bed.

Long fingers. Pale, stretched skin. Moving with slow, deliberate intent.

Reaching for me.

A strangled gasp caught in my throat. My body locked up, every instinct screaming at me to run, to scream, to *do something*. But I couldn’t. I was frozen in place, my eyes locked on the thing creeping toward me.

Then—*I slammed my eyes shut.*

Darkness.

The whispering stopped.

Silence swallowed the room. The air around me felt charged, like something was waiting. Watching.

I lay there, unmoving, not even daring to breathe. I don’t know how long I stayed like that. Maybe seconds. Maybe hours. But eventually, exhaustion pulled me under.

When I woke up, sunlight spilled through my curtains, and the world outside carried on like normal. But I knew—*I knew*—it hadn’t been a dream.

My blanket was twisted, yanked toward the floor, like something had grabbed it during the night.

I should have told my parents. I should have *never* listened.

But I did.

And the next night, I listened again.

This time, I did more than listen.

I **opened my eyes**.

I shouldn’t have. I **know** I shouldn’t have. But it was a cycle—an endless loop you just can’t break free from.

I **opened my eyes**.

And something was staring back at me.

At first, I couldn’t move. My breath hitched, my body frozen as my vision adjusted to the darkness. But the shadows at the foot of my bed weren’t just shadows. A shape crouched there, its form barely visible except for two hollow, glowing eyes. They weren’t like normal eyes—not reflections of light, not human. They were empty, endless, as if I was staring into something that shouldn’t exist.

Its mouth stretched too wide. Far too wide. No lips, just a jagged, gaping line that seemed to curl upward in something that was almost—but not quite—a smile. It didn’t move. It didn’t blink. It just **watched me**.

Then, it whispered.

*""You're awake.""*

Its voice wasn’t loud. It wasn’t a growl or a snarl. It was soft, almost amused, like it had been waiting for this moment.

The signal cut off.

The hum stopped.

The room was silent again.

The thing under my bed was gone.

But I knew—it hadn’t really left. It was **still there**, hiding in the shadows, waiting for me to slip up again.

The next morning, my parents acted like nothing had happened. My mom hummed while making breakfast. My dad read the newspaper, sipping his coffee like it was any other day. They didn’t notice the way my hands shook when I reached for my spoon. They didn’t notice the way I flinched when my phone screen flickered for just a second, as if **it** was watching me through it.

But then, I looked outside.

And I noticed something.

The street was lined with missing person posters.

At least five new faces.

All kids.

They stared back at me from the faded, wrinkled paper—smiling school photos, names printed in bold. I didn’t recognize them, but somehow, I knew. They had heard the whispers too.

They had stayed awake.

And now, they were **gone**.

That night, I made a decision.

I didn’t go to bed.

I couldn’t.

I **needed to know** what happened to the ones who were taken.

So when the emergency alert played at 9:50, I ignored it. My parents called for me to get ready, but I just sat there, staring at my darkened phone screen. I didn’t lay down. I didn’t shut my eyes.

When the clock struck **10:00 PM**, the hum returned.

This time, it was different.

It wasn’t just a noise. It was **angry**.

The whispers grew louder, pressing against my skull, twisting into words I almost understood. The air in my room grew thick, suffocating. My skin prickled with something worse than fear—something ancient, something **hungry**.

Then—

The power went out.

Not just in my room. Not just in the house.

The entire street went dark.

For a few terrifying seconds, there was nothing but silence. Then, the first **creak** broke through the blackness.

Something moved in my closet.

The door **slowly** creaked open—just an inch.

A long, pale arm slid out.

It wasn’t human. Too thin, too stretched. Its fingers twitched as it reached forward, curling in invitation.

*""Come with us,""* the whispers said.

I bolted.

I ran out of my room, my heartbeat slamming against my ribs. But the second I stepped into the hallway, I knew something was **wrong**.

The house wasn’t the same.

The walls stretched higher than they should have, towering above me like I was trapped inside a nightmare. The doors—my parents’ room, the bathroom, the front door—were **too far away**, like the hallway had doubled in length.

I turned toward my parents’ room, my last hope—but the door was open, and there was **nothing** inside. Just blackness. No furniture, no walls. Just **emptiness**.

The whispers closed in.

I turned—

And **it** was there.

The thing from under my bed.

Its face was inches from mine, those hollow eyes swallowing every sliver of light. I felt its breath against my skin—**ice-cold**, reeking of something **old**, something **dead**.

*""You stayed awake,""* it whispered.

Its mouth curled into that **too-wide smile**.

*""Now you are ours.""*

I tried to scream. I **tried**.

But the sound never came.

The last thing I saw was its mouth stretching **wider, wider, wider**—until it swallowed everything.

Then…

**Darkness.**

I woke up in my bed.

For a brief, flickering moment, I thought maybe—just **maybe**—it had all been a dream.

Then, I got up.

I walked to the kitchen.

And I realized something was **wrong**.

The house was silent. Too silent.

My parents weren’t there.

I called out for them, but my voice barely echoed in the emptiness. Their bedroom was still there, but the bed was untouched. The lights were on, but everything felt **hollow**, like a perfect set designed to look like home but **not** *be* home.

Then, I stepped outside.

More missing person posters covered the street.

But this time—

**My face was on them too.**

The world went on.

People walked past me. Cars rolled by. Birds chirped, the wind blew, and everything continued like I wasn’t even there.

Like I had never been there at all.

I tried to speak to someone—to my neighbors, to a passing stranger—but no one looked at me. No one **saw** me.

No one **heard** me.

I was still here.

But I wasn’t **real** anymore.

And tonight, when the emergency alert plays at 9:50 PM…

1iqirr6,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/1iqirr6/21m_here_after_a_rough_few_years_looking_for/,"21m here after a rough few years, looking for advice on rebuilding and small wins","Hello,

I just discovered this subreddit in search of advice I am desperately seeking. I am a 21M and have had a really rough past 3-4 years. In 2022 my drug use increased exponentially. I'm trying not to make this a whole 'life post' so I mostly want to cover the 'now' but some details are necessary. I was basically a straight 'A' student admitted into a extremely prestigious university for engineering but my crashing mental health hit a bottom. I abused many hard drugs including (and mainly) alcohol, weed, opiates, and psychedelics. Failed out of school in a semester and floundered around for a couple years making just enough money to get high and live. 

I got out of rehab in December and was sober for 6 months. Had a little slip with weed one day in January but got right back on the train and am now sober for 1 month and I really have no craving to use. I now live in a sober house. I am in community college (all online classes) now doing 15 credits and work a part time job 30 hours a week. While I am working on myself with school and work, my self-care is very bad and I don't really know where to start to fix it. For general reference when I was 16 I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder (Severe), Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. I also had an episode of drug-induced psychosis in 2022 which I was hospitalized in the psych unit for 11 days.

I do well in work and school but I really enjoy school so its a good outlet.

  
My average day is: Go to work (wake up 4:45am for 5:30am shift), get home usually around 10-1 with a fast food meal depending on the day, do school work until 8-9pm then sleep around 10-11pm. On days I have off I usually wake up whenever, grab a cup of coffee, work on school until around 7-8pm, eat a meal, then lay in bed until I fall asleep around 10pm-12am. I usually quite literally do nothing else besides school and work besides the occasional shower, meal, or YouTube break. 

My main problem is I think of all these things I need to work on and I feel paralyzed. I have tried improving before but did a very much 'all or nothing' approach. Being extremely exhausted from school and work adds to it too. Today I set a small goal of brushing my teeth in the morning and at night for a week and I'm going to see if I can do that.

I find a lot of my stress comes from simply living life, going to work, and doing school, as well as these bad self-care habits. Also, since I am extremely shy, small, bad looking, and generally unkempt/disgusting I am a very easy target at work and home with roommates and coworkers and I really often get picked on and bullied. This just makes my mental health worse.

My main goal in life is to school hopefully to get a PhD in something I really enjoy. But these things are not at all achievable with how I live. I also really like music, art, outdoors, and hunting. Hunting was my biggest hobby from 12-17ish but I'm no longer trusted with guns so I am not allowed to hunt anymore.

  
Any advice on things that helped you?

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some things I'd like to work on is: 

\* Get on and consistently take psych medication (I have a history of not taking meds). I'd like to not have suicidal thoughts from morning-night.

\* I am extremely closed off, people don't know how bad I am struggling with self-care because of shame and trust issues (like parents, therapists, friends).

\* Washing my clothes so I'm not wearing dirty clothes

\* Brushing my teeth everyday. I am in constant mouth pain from TMJ, grinding, and bad oral hygeine. 

\* Showering everyday

\* Eating 2-3 meals a day, I eat probably around 600-1200 cals a day because I don't have motivation to cook and my appetite is really bad. I usually eat a small/medium fast food meal once a day. Some days I will gorge and eat \~3000 calories a day in junk.

\* Getting physically active, I really like the idea of lifting weights and getting stronger, and also being flexible and running

\* Stopping vaping/smoking/dipping

\* Better sleep hygiene

\* Better budgeting. I have +$1500 in credit card debt that I am desperately trying to pay off but a lot of my money goes to fast food as I don't have motivation to cook. I have been better about it though and have paid off $500 in the past month.

\* Treat my skin

\* Being generally cleaner

\* Being a generally better person. Less anxious, depressed, and irratible. 

\* Stop being extremely shy and timid

\* Invest in myself via hobbies, more educated media (not stupid YouTube and video games), and life experiences.

1iqirk4,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1iqirk4/emergency_alert_fall_asleep_before_10_pm_the/,Emergency Alert : Fall asleep before 10 PM | The Bedtime Signal,"I used to think bedtime was just a routine—something we all had to do, a simple part of life like eating or brushing your teeth. Every night, it was the same: wash my face, change into pajamas, climb into bed, and turn off the lights. Nothing special. Nothing to be afraid of. If anything, bedtime was boring, a mindless transition from one day to the next.

But that was before the emergency alerts started.

It began last week, just a little after 9:50 PM. I was lounging in bed, lazily scrolling through my tablet, half-watching some video I wasn’t even paying attention to. The night felt normal, quiet, the kind of stillness that settles after a long day. But then, out of nowhere, every single screen in my room flickered at once. My tablet. My phone. Even the small digital clock on my nightstand. The glow of their displays pulsed strangely, like they were struggling to stay on. A faint crackling sound filled the air, like the buzz of static on an old TV.

Then, the emergency broadcast cut through the silence. The voice was robotic, unnatural, crackling with distortion.

***""This is an emergency alert. At exactly 10:00 PM, all electronic devices will emit The Bedtime Signal. You must be in bed with your eyes closed before the signal begins. Those who remain awake and aware will be taken.""***

The message repeated twice, each word pressing into my brain like a weight. Then, without warning, the screen on my tablet went black. My phone, too. Even the digital clock stopped glowing, leaving the room eerily dim. A moment later, everything powered back on, as if nothing had happened. No error messages. No explanation. Just back to normal.

At first, I thought it had to be some kind of elaborate prank. Maybe a weird internet hoax or some kind of system glitch. But something about it didn’t feel right. The voice had been too… deliberate. Too cold.

Then I heard my mom’s voice from down the hall.

""Alex! Time for bed!""

She sounded urgent—too urgent. This wasn’t her usual half-distracted reminder before she went to bed herself. There was an edge to her voice, a sharpness that made my stomach twist. I swung my legs off the bed and peeked out of my room.

Down the hallway, I saw her and my dad moving quickly. My mom was locking the front door, double-checking the deadbolt with shaking fingers. My dad was yanking cords out of the wall, unplugging the TV, the microwave, even the Wi-Fi router. It wasn’t normal bedtime behavior. It was like they were preparing for a storm.

""What’s going on?"" I asked, my voice small.

They both looked up at me, and the fear in their eyes hit me like a punch to the chest. My dad stepped forward, his face grim.

""Don’t stay up past ten,"" he said, his voice tight. ""No matter what you hear.""

I wanted to ask more, to demand answers, but something in their expressions stopped me cold. Whatever was happening, it was real. And it was dangerous.

I went back to my room, my parents' warning still fresh in my mind. I didn’t know what was happening, but their fear had seeped into me, wrapping around my chest like invisible vines. Swallowing hard, I slid under the covers, pulling the blanket up to my chin as if it could somehow protect me.

I checked the time. **9:59 PM.**

One minute.

The air felt heavier, thicker, like the room itself was holding its breath. Then, I heard it.

At first, it was so faint I almost thought I was imagining it. A whisper—so soft, so distant, like someone murmuring from the farthest corner of the house. But then, the sound grew louder, rising from my phone. It wasn’t a notification chime or a ringtone. It was… wrong. A high-pitched, eerie hum that sent a ripple of cold down my spine. My tablet buzzed with the same noise. So did my alarm clock. My laptop, even though it was powered off. Every screen. Every speaker. Every single electronic device in my room was playing it.

The sound wasn’t just noise. It was *alive.*

And underneath it… something else.

A voice.

It was buried beneath the hum, layered so deep I could barely hear it, but it was there. Whispering. Speaking in a language I didn’t understand. The words slithered through the noise, soft but insistent, like they were meant just for me.

I wanted to listen.

Something about it pulled at me, like a hook digging into my mind, reeling me in. My heartbeat pounded in my ears, my fingers curled against the sheets. If I focused, maybe—just maybe—I could understand what it was saying.

But then my dad’s warning echoed in my head.

***""No matter what you hear.""***

I clenched my jaw, shut my eyes, and forced myself to stay still. My body was tense, every muscle screaming at me to move, to run, to do *something*. But I stayed frozen, gripping the blankets like they were my last lifeline.

Then, just as suddenly as it had started… it stopped.

Silence.

I didn’t open my eyes right away. I lay there, listening, waiting for something—*anything*—to happen. But there was nothing. No more whispers. No more hum. The room felt normal again, but I wasn’t fooled.

Eventually, exhaustion won. I drifted off, my body giving in to sleep.

The next morning, I woke up to sunlight streaming through my window, birds chirping outside like it was just another ordinary day. My tablet was right where I left it. My phone showed no weird notifications. The world kept moving like nothing had happened.

But I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was *wrong*.

That night, at exactly 9:50 PM, the emergency alert returned.

*""This is an emergency alert. At exactly 10:00 PM, all electronic devices will emit The Bedtime Signal. You must be in bed with your eyes closed before the signal begins. Those who remain awake and aware will be taken.""*

The same robotic voice. The same crackling static. The same uneasy feeling creeping over my skin.

I watched as my parents rushed through the house, their movements identical to the night before—checking locks, closing blinds, making sure everything was unplugged. My mom’s hands trembled as she turned off the lights. My dad barely spoke, his jaw tight.

But tonight, something inside me was different.

I wasn’t as scared.

I was *curious*.

I wanted to know why.

What was The Bedtime Signal? What would happen if I didn’t close my eyes? Who—*or what*—was speaking beneath the hum?

So when the clock struck ten, and the eerie hum filled my room again, I didn’t shut my eyes right away.

I *listened*.

The whispering was clearer this time. The words still didn’t make sense, but they sounded closer, like whoever—or *whatever*—was speaking had moved toward me. My skin prickled, my breaths shallow.

Then, from somewhere beneath my bed, the wooden frame creaked.

I stiffened.

A single thought echoed in my head: *I’m not alone.*

I held my breath, my heart hammering against my ribs. Slowly, cautiously, I turned my head just enough to see the edge of my blanket. The whispering grew louder, pressing against my ears like cold fingers.

And then—

A hand slid out from the darkness under my bed.

Long fingers. Pale, stretched skin. Moving with slow, deliberate intent.

Reaching for me.

A strangled gasp caught in my throat. My body locked up, every instinct screaming at me to run, to scream, to *do something*. But I couldn’t. I was frozen in place, my eyes locked on the thing creeping toward me.

Then—*I slammed my eyes shut.*

Darkness.

The whispering stopped.

Silence swallowed the room. The air around me felt charged, like something was waiting. Watching.

I lay there, unmoving, not even daring to breathe. I don’t know how long I stayed like that. Maybe seconds. Maybe hours. But eventually, exhaustion pulled me under.

When I woke up, sunlight spilled through my curtains, and the world outside carried on like normal. But I knew—*I knew*—it hadn’t been a dream.

My blanket was twisted, yanked toward the floor, like something had grabbed it during the night.

I should have told my parents. I should have *never* listened.

But I did.

And the next night, I listened again.

This time, I did more than listen.

I **opened my eyes**.

I shouldn’t have. I **know** I shouldn’t have. But it was a cycle—an endless loop you just can’t break free from.

I **opened my eyes**.

And something was staring back at me.

At first, I couldn’t move. My breath hitched, my body frozen as my vision adjusted to the darkness. But the shadows at the foot of my bed weren’t just shadows. A shape crouched there, its form barely visible except for two hollow, glowing eyes. They weren’t like normal eyes—not reflections of light, not human. They were empty, endless, as if I was staring into something that shouldn’t exist.

Its mouth stretched too wide. Far too wide. No lips, just a jagged, gaping line that seemed to curl upward in something that was almost—but not quite—a smile. It didn’t move. It didn’t blink. It just **watched me**.

Then, it whispered.

*""You're awake.""*

Its voice wasn’t loud. It wasn’t a growl or a snarl. It was soft, almost amused, like it had been waiting for this moment.

The signal cut off.

The hum stopped.

The room was silent again.

The thing under my bed was gone.

But I knew—it hadn’t really left. It was **still there**, hiding in the shadows, waiting for me to slip up again.

The next morning, my parents acted like nothing had happened. My mom hummed while making breakfast. My dad read the newspaper, sipping his coffee like it was any other day. They didn’t notice the way my hands shook when I reached for my spoon. They didn’t notice the way I flinched when my phone screen flickered for just a second, as if **it** was watching me through it.

But then, I looked outside.

And I noticed something.

The street was lined with missing person posters.

At least five new faces.

All kids.

They stared back at me from the faded, wrinkled paper—smiling school photos, names printed in bold. I didn’t recognize them, but somehow, I knew. They had heard the whispers too.

They had stayed awake.

And now, they were **gone**.

That night, I made a decision.

I didn’t go to bed.

I couldn’t.

I **needed to know** what happened to the ones who were taken.

So when the emergency alert played at 9:50, I ignored it. My parents called for me to get ready, but I just sat there, staring at my darkened phone screen. I didn’t lay down. I didn’t shut my eyes.

When the clock struck **10:00 PM**, the hum returned.

This time, it was different.

It wasn’t just a noise. It was **angry**.

The whispers grew louder, pressing against my skull, twisting into words I almost understood. The air in my room grew thick, suffocating. My skin prickled with something worse than fear—something ancient, something **hungry**.

Then—

The power went out.

Not just in my room. Not just in the house.

The entire street went dark.

For a few terrifying seconds, there was nothing but silence. Then, the first **creak** broke through the blackness.

Something moved in my closet.

The door **slowly** creaked open—just an inch.

A long, pale arm slid out.

It wasn’t human. Too thin, too stretched. Its fingers twitched as it reached forward, curling in invitation.

*""Come with us,""* the whispers said.

I bolted.

I ran out of my room, my heartbeat slamming against my ribs. But the second I stepped into the hallway, I knew something was **wrong**.

The house wasn’t the same.

The walls stretched higher than they should have, towering above me like I was trapped inside a nightmare. The doors—my parents’ room, the bathroom, the front door—were **too far away**, like the hallway had doubled in length.

I turned toward my parents’ room, my last hope—but the door was open, and there was **nothing** inside. Just blackness. No furniture, no walls. Just **emptiness**.

The whispers closed in.

I turned—

And **it** was there.

The thing from under my bed.

Its face was inches from mine, those hollow eyes swallowing every sliver of light. I felt its breath against my skin—**ice-cold**, reeking of something **old**, something **dead**.

*""You stayed awake,""* it whispered.

Its mouth curled into that **too-wide smile**.

*""Now you are ours.""*

I tried to scream. I **tried**.

But the sound never came.

The last thing I saw was its mouth stretching **wider, wider, wider**—until it swallowed everything.

Then…

**Darkness.**

I woke up in my bed.

For a brief, flickering moment, I thought maybe—just **maybe**—it had all been a dream.

Then, I got up.

I walked to the kitchen.

And I realized something was **wrong**.

The house was silent. Too silent.

My parents weren’t there.

I called out for them, but my voice barely echoed in the emptiness. Their bedroom was still there, but the bed was untouched. The lights were on, but everything felt **hollow**, like a perfect set designed to look like home but **not** *be* home.

Then, I stepped outside.

More missing person posters covered the street.

But this time—

**My face was on them too.**

The world went on.

People walked past me. Cars rolled by. Birds chirped, the wind blew, and everything continued like I wasn’t even there.

Like I had never been there at all.

I tried to speak to someone—to my neighbors, to a passing stranger—but no one looked at me. No one **saw** me.

No one **heard** me.

I was still here.

But I wasn’t **real** anymore.

1iqirej,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iqirej,How to Create a Cohesive Home?,"First time using reddit, please be nice! I'm wondering how to create a cohesive space and home without buying all new furniture and decor??? A couple years ago, I went through a grey and white phase. As a result all of my ""living room"" furniture is that scheme and I added the pops of gold in certain things to make it feel a little different. Now, I feel like I'm obsessed with green, white and natural wood tones. I guess you could say boho or something? I'm having trouble blending these styles. In general, I like cozy clean spaces with plants, small pops of color and vintage. I'd like to stay away from furniture that doesn't last and lean more into refurnished/ secondhand. Both the TV stand and coffee table are from Amazon and I'm not really a fan of that fake wood farmhouse style anymore, but I also can't really spend the money on anything else rn. Definitely can't just get rid of the dark grey couch. If the solution is to redecorate the living room, what are your suggestions? Thanks!",7,1739675095.0,interiordecorating,4,1.0,False

1iqiqup,https://www.reddit.com/r/stayawake/comments/1iqiqup/emergency_alert_fall_asleep_before_10_pm_the/,Emergency Alert : Fall asleep before 10 PM | The Bedtime Signal,"I used to think bedtime was just a routine—something we all had to do, a simple part of life like eating or brushing your teeth. Every night, it was the same: wash my face, change into pajamas, climb into bed, and turn off the lights. Nothing special. Nothing to be afraid of. If anything, bedtime was boring, a mindless transition from one day to the next.

But that was before the emergency alerts started.

It began last week, just a little after 9:50 PM. I was lounging in bed, lazily scrolling through my tablet, half-watching some video I wasn’t even paying attention to. The night felt normal, quiet, the kind of stillness that settles after a long day. But then, out of nowhere, every single screen in my room flickered at once. My tablet. My phone. Even the small digital clock on my nightstand. The glow of their displays pulsed strangely, like they were struggling to stay on. A faint crackling sound filled the air, like the buzz of static on an old TV.

Then, the emergency broadcast cut through the silence. The voice was robotic, unnatural, crackling with distortion.

***""This is an emergency alert. At exactly 10:00 PM, all electronic devices will emit The Bedtime Signal. You must be in bed with your eyes closed before the signal begins. Those who remain awake and aware will be taken.""***

The message repeated twice, each word pressing into my brain like a weight. Then, without warning, the screen on my tablet went black. My phone, too. Even the digital clock stopped glowing, leaving the room eerily dim. A moment later, everything powered back on, as if nothing had happened. No error messages. No explanation. Just back to normal.

At first, I thought it had to be some kind of elaborate prank. Maybe a weird internet hoax or some kind of system glitch. But something about it didn’t feel right. The voice had been too… deliberate. Too cold.

Then I heard my mom’s voice from down the hall.

""Alex! Time for bed!""

She sounded urgent—too urgent. This wasn’t her usual half-distracted reminder before she went to bed herself. There was an edge to her voice, a sharpness that made my stomach twist. I swung my legs off the bed and peeked out of my room.

Down the hallway, I saw her and my dad moving quickly. My mom was locking the front door, double-checking the deadbolt with shaking fingers. My dad was yanking cords out of the wall, unplugging the TV, the microwave, even the Wi-Fi router. It wasn’t normal bedtime behavior. It was like they were preparing for a storm.

""What’s going on?"" I asked, my voice small.

They both looked up at me, and the fear in their eyes hit me like a punch to the chest. My dad stepped forward, his face grim.

""Don’t stay up past ten,"" he said, his voice tight. ""No matter what you hear.""

I wanted to ask more, to demand answers, but something in their expressions stopped me cold. Whatever was happening, it was real. And it was dangerous.

I went back to my room, my parents' warning still fresh in my mind. I didn’t know what was happening, but their fear had seeped into me, wrapping around my chest like invisible vines. Swallowing hard, I slid under the covers, pulling the blanket up to my chin as if it could somehow protect me.

I checked the time. **9:59 PM.**

One minute.

The air felt heavier, thicker, like the room itself was holding its breath. Then, I heard it.

At first, it was so faint I almost thought I was imagining it. A whisper—so soft, so distant, like someone murmuring from the farthest corner of the house. But then, the sound grew louder, rising from my phone. It wasn’t a notification chime or a ringtone. It was… wrong. A high-pitched, eerie hum that sent a ripple of cold down my spine. My tablet buzzed with the same noise. So did my alarm clock. My laptop, even though it was powered off. Every screen. Every speaker. Every single electronic device in my room was playing it.

The sound wasn’t just noise. It was *alive.*

And underneath it… something else.

A voice.

It was buried beneath the hum, layered so deep I could barely hear it, but it was there. Whispering. Speaking in a language I didn’t understand. The words slithered through the noise, soft but insistent, like they were meant just for me.

I wanted to listen.

Something about it pulled at me, like a hook digging into my mind, reeling me in. My heartbeat pounded in my ears, my fingers curled against the sheets. If I focused, maybe—just maybe—I could understand what it was saying.

But then my dad’s warning echoed in my head.

***""No matter what you hear.""***

I clenched my jaw, shut my eyes, and forced myself to stay still. My body was tense, every muscle screaming at me to move, to run, to do *something*. But I stayed frozen, gripping the blankets like they were my last lifeline.

Then, just as suddenly as it had started… it stopped.

Silence.

I didn’t open my eyes right away. I lay there, listening, waiting for something—*anything*—to happen. But there was nothing. No more whispers. No more hum. The room felt normal again, but I wasn’t fooled.

Eventually, exhaustion won. I drifted off, my body giving in to sleep.

The next morning, I woke up to sunlight streaming through my window, birds chirping outside like it was just another ordinary day. My tablet was right where I left it. My phone showed no weird notifications. The world kept moving like nothing had happened.

But I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was *wrong*.

That night, at exactly 9:50 PM, the emergency alert returned.

*""This is an emergency alert. At exactly 10:00 PM, all electronic devices will emit The Bedtime Signal. You must be in bed with your eyes closed before the signal begins. Those who remain awake and aware will be taken.""*

The same robotic voice. The same crackling static. The same uneasy feeling creeping over my skin.

I watched as my parents rushed through the house, their movements identical to the night before—checking locks, closing blinds, making sure everything was unplugged. My mom’s hands trembled as she turned off the lights. My dad barely spoke, his jaw tight.

But tonight, something inside me was different.

I wasn’t as scared.

I was *curious*.

I wanted to know why.

What was The Bedtime Signal? What would happen if I didn’t close my eyes? Who—*or what*—was speaking beneath the hum?

So when the clock struck ten, and the eerie hum filled my room again, I didn’t shut my eyes right away.

I *listened*.

The whispering was clearer this time. The words still didn’t make sense, but they sounded closer, like whoever—or *whatever*—was speaking had moved toward me. My skin prickled, my breaths shallow.

Then, from somewhere beneath my bed, the wooden frame creaked.

I stiffened.

A single thought echoed in my head: *I’m not alone.*

I held my breath, my heart hammering against my ribs. Slowly, cautiously, I turned my head just enough to see the edge of my blanket. The whispering grew louder, pressing against my ears like cold fingers.

And then—

A hand slid out from the darkness under my bed.

Long fingers. Pale, stretched skin. Moving with slow, deliberate intent.

Reaching for me.

A strangled gasp caught in my throat. My body locked up, every instinct screaming at me to run, to scream, to *do something*. But I couldn’t. I was frozen in place, my eyes locked on the thing creeping toward me.

Then—*I slammed my eyes shut.*

Darkness.

The whispering stopped.

Silence swallowed the room. The air around me felt charged, like something was waiting. Watching.

I lay there, unmoving, not even daring to breathe. I don’t know how long I stayed like that. Maybe seconds. Maybe hours. But eventually, exhaustion pulled me under.

When I woke up, sunlight spilled through my curtains, and the world outside carried on like normal. But I knew—*I knew*—it hadn’t been a dream.

My blanket was twisted, yanked toward the floor, like something had grabbed it during the night.

I should have told my parents. I should have *never* listened.

But I did.

And the next night, I listened again.

This time, I did more than listen.

I **opened my eyes**.

I shouldn’t have. I **know** I shouldn’t have. But it was a cycle—an endless loop you just can’t break free from.

I **opened my eyes**.

And something was staring back at me.

At first, I couldn’t move. My breath hitched, my body frozen as my vision adjusted to the darkness. But the shadows at the foot of my bed weren’t just shadows. A shape crouched there, its form barely visible except for two hollow, glowing eyes. They weren’t like normal eyes—not reflections of light, not human. They were empty, endless, as if I was staring into something that shouldn’t exist.

Its mouth stretched too wide. Far too wide. No lips, just a jagged, gaping line that seemed to curl upward in something that was almost—but not quite—a smile. It didn’t move. It didn’t blink. It just **watched me**.

Then, it whispered.

*""You're awake.""*

Its voice wasn’t loud. It wasn’t a growl or a snarl. It was soft, almost amused, like it had been waiting for this moment.

The signal cut off.

The hum stopped.

The room was silent again.

The thing under my bed was gone.

But I knew—it hadn’t really left. It was **still there**, hiding in the shadows, waiting for me to slip up again.

The next morning, my parents acted like nothing had happened. My mom hummed while making breakfast. My dad read the newspaper, sipping his coffee like it was any other day. They didn’t notice the way my hands shook when I reached for my spoon. They didn’t notice the way I flinched when my phone screen flickered for just a second, as if **it** was watching me through it.

But then, I looked outside.

And I noticed something.

The street was lined with missing person posters.

At least five new faces.

All kids.

They stared back at me from the faded, wrinkled paper—smiling school photos, names printed in bold. I didn’t recognize them, but somehow, I knew. They had heard the whispers too.

They had stayed awake.

And now, they were **gone**.

That night, I made a decision.

I didn’t go to bed.

I couldn’t.

I **needed to know** what happened to the ones who were taken.

So when the emergency alert played at 9:50, I ignored it. My parents called for me to get ready, but I just sat there, staring at my darkened phone screen. I didn’t lay down. I didn’t shut my eyes.

When the clock struck **10:00 PM**, the hum returned.

This time, it was different.

It wasn’t just a noise. It was **angry**.

The whispers grew louder, pressing against my skull, twisting into words I almost understood. The air in my room grew thick, suffocating. My skin prickled with something worse than fear—something ancient, something **hungry**.

Then—

The power went out.

Not just in my room. Not just in the house.

The entire street went dark.

For a few terrifying seconds, there was nothing but silence. Then, the first **creak** broke through the blackness.

Something moved in my closet.

The door **slowly** creaked open—just an inch.

A long, pale arm slid out.

It wasn’t human. Too thin, too stretched. Its fingers twitched as it reached forward, curling in invitation.

*""Come with us,""* the whispers said.

I bolted.

I ran out of my room, my heartbeat slamming against my ribs. But the second I stepped into the hallway, I knew something was **wrong**.

The house wasn’t the same.

The walls stretched higher than they should have, towering above me like I was trapped inside a nightmare. The doors—my parents’ room, the bathroom, the front door—were **too far away**, like the hallway had doubled in length.

I turned toward my parents’ room, my last hope—but the door was open, and there was **nothing** inside. Just blackness. No furniture, no walls. Just **emptiness**.

The whispers closed in.

I turned—

And **it** was there.

The thing from under my bed.

Its face was inches from mine, those hollow eyes swallowing every sliver of light. I felt its breath against my skin—**ice-cold**, reeking of something **old**, something **dead**.

*""You stayed awake,""* it whispered.

Its mouth curled into that **too-wide smile**.

*""Now you are ours.""*

I tried to scream. I **tried**.

But the sound never came.

The last thing I saw was its mouth stretching **wider, wider, wider**—until it swallowed everything.

Then…

**Darkness.**

I woke up in my bed.

For a brief, flickering moment, I thought maybe—just **maybe**—it had all been a dream.

Then, I got up.

I walked to the kitchen.

And I realized something was **wrong**.

The house was silent. Too silent.

My parents weren’t there.

I called out for them, but my voice barely echoed in the emptiness. Their bedroom was still there, but the bed was untouched. The lights were on, but everything felt **hollow**, like a perfect set designed to look like home but **not** *be* home.

Then, I stepped outside.

More missing person posters covered the street.

But this time—

**My face was on them too.**

The world went on.

People walked past me. Cars rolled by. Birds chirped, the wind blew, and everything continued like I wasn’t even there.

Like I had never been there at all.

I tried to speak to someone—to my neighbors, to a passing stranger—but no one looked at me. No one **saw** me.

No one **heard** me.

I was still here.

But I wasn’t **real** anymore.

And tonight, when the emergency alert plays at 9:50 PM…

Fair enough, I don't mind a rejection but it confuses me since its the exact same every time. 

When it comes to being friends, I've got more than enough but I don't want to be an asshole so I agree and keep in touch. They are really nice girls and we still get along great, so I guess thats a win. The 3rd and 4th time I decided to just explain that I'm really busy and don't have time for more friends. Honestly, I felt bad since one of the girls was really upset by this. But again this just confuses me, if you don't want to date me then why are you upset that I won't spend time / talk with you?

1iqiouw,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/1iqiouw/my_girlfriends_ex_is_obsessed_with_me/,My girlfriends ex is obsessed with me,"I’m so fed up with this situation this is my first post. So basically I live in a small town so it’s not uncommon to run into people who you don’t want to see however it’s gotten to a point where it’s just creepy and I’m sick of it. So basically my 21F girlfriend 26f have been together for 3 years. We met 4 years ago and were friends before we got together even though we always liked each other. She has an ex girlfriend who she described to me as “crazy” which originally was a red flag to me until I met the woman. 

I had met her maybe once or twice in passing prior to my girlfriend and I dating because she would come to my job to check out at my register specifically. It wasn’t a huge deal to me I always tried to be friendly because I couldn’t imagine she still had feelings given that they broke up like 6 or 7 years ago at that point. 

Once my girlfriend and I started dating her ex seemed to try to interfere more and more with our relationship. The only reason she was able to interfere at all was because my girlfriend remained friendly with her ex’s sister which didn’t bother me either because I don’t want to control who she is friends with and I was often invited to hang out with them as well. Overtime clearly this caused some issues because the ex would always try to be around my girlfriend and it just gave me a weird feeling. I brought it up to my girlfriend and she reassured me that the only time she would see the sister was if I was there as well (I have her location so I wasn’t worried about her sneaking around). This seemed to solve it but then came the calls from unknown numbers and cars beeping at my girlfriend’s house and just other attention seeking behavior from the ex. I’m friendly with some of the same people her ex is friends with and I’m always told that my girlfriend and I am are hot topic of conversation between both the sister and the ex. 

It’s just annoying the ex is 30 years old and the behavior is just so dramatic and almost unbelievable for a person her age. This all came to a head this morning when my girlfriend took my car out in the morning while I was still asleep to get us breakfast. To get to Dunkin she has to pass by her ex’s house (which she did not beep her horn at because she is an adult) and immediately after passing by her ex’s sister’s car pulled out of their house and started tailing her and ended up following her all the way to Dunkin. I assume they thought it was me alone in the car but regardless, that is just weird. Once they all arrived, the ex and her sister got out of their car and my girlfriend got out of mine and asked me why they followed her. They apparently all had words, in which they did admit to following my car specifically, ending with my girlfriend telling them to stay away from us. I feel like I’m being harassed at this point I just want to be left alone and for this woman to get over it because it’s been years. My question is if it was me in the car what were they going to do? Watch me go into the store and come out with my coffee? 

I try not to let it all bother me because I have bigger things to worry about but I’m just so sick and tired of feeling a little bit anxious every time I go to like the grocery store that I’m going to run into these people. My girlfriend and I are very happy together and I know that’s all that matters but I wish these people would leave me alone it’s just creepy and freaky behavior. It’s like both the ex and the sister are obsessed with my relationship and I’m just tired of it I want to send the ex a message telling her to basically get over it and leave me alone because honestly I feel that following my car really crossed a line but at the same time I don’t want to stoop to that level and feed into the drama.

1iqiots,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1iqiots/21m_mental_health_struggles_seeking_advice_on/,21M & Mental health struggles. Seeking advice on small changes to boost self-care & build better habits,"Hello,

I just discovered this subreddit in search of advice I am desperately seeking. I am a 21M and have had a really rough past 3-4 years. It mostly started when I broke up with my girlfriend of 4 years in 2022 and my drug use increased exponentially. I'm trying not to make this a whole 'life post' so I mostly want to cover the 'now' but some details are necessary. I was basically a straight 'A' student admitted into a extremely prestigious university for engineering but my crashing mental health hit a bottom. I abused many hard drugs including (and mainly) alcohol, weed, opiates, and psychedelics. Failed out of school in a semester and floundered around for a couple years making just enough money to get high and live. 

I got out of rehab in December and was sober for 6 months. Had a little slip with weed one day in January but got right back on the train and am now sober for 1 month and I really have no craving to use. I now live in a sober house. I am in community college (all online classes) now doing 15 credits and work a part time job 30 hours a week. While I am working on myself with school and work, my self-care is very bad and I don't really know where to start to fix it. For general reference when I was 16 I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder (Severe), Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. I also had an episode of drug-induced psychosis in 2022 which I was hospitalized in the psych unit for 11 days.

I do well in work and school but I really enjoy school so its a good outlet.

  
My average day is: Go to work (wake up 4:45am for 5:30am shift), get home usually around 10-1 with a fast food meal depending on the day, do school work until 8-9pm then sleep around 10-11pm. On days I have off I usually wake up whenever, grab a cup of coffee, work on school until around 7-8pm, eat a meal, then lay in bed until I fall asleep around 10pm-12am. I usually quite literally do nothing else besides school and work besides the occasional shower, meal, or YouTube break. 

My main problem is I think of all these things I need to work on and I feel paralyzed. I have tried improving before but did a very much 'all or nothing' approach. Being extremely exhausted from school and work adds to it too. Today I set a small goal of brushing my teeth in the morning and at night for a week and I'm going to see if I can do that.

I find a lot of my stress comes from simply living life, going to work, and doing school, as well as these bad self-care habits. Also, since I am extremely shy, small, bad looking, and generally unkempt/disgusting I am a very easy target at work and home with roommates and coworkers and I really often get picked on and bullied. This just makes my mental health worse.

My main goal in life is to marry someone I truly love and go to school hopefully to get a PhD in something I really enjoy. But these things are not at all achievable with how I live. I also really like music, art, outdoors, and hunting. Hunting was my biggest hobby from 12-17ish but I'm no longer trusted with guns so I am not allowed to hunt anymore.

  
Any advice on things that helped you?

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some things I'd like to work on is: 

\* Get on and consistently take psych medication (I have a history of not taking meds). I'd like to not have suicidal thoughts from morning-night.

\* I am extremely closed off, people don't know how bad I am struggling with self-care because of shame and trust issues (like parents, therapists, friends).

\* Washing my clothes so I'm not wearing dirty clothes

\* Brushing my teeth everyday. I am in constant mouth pain from TMJ, grinding, and bad oral hygeine. 

\* Showering everyday

\* Eating 2-3 meals a day, I eat probably around 600-1200 cals a day because I don't have motivation to cook and my appetite is really bad. I usually eat a small/medium fast food meal once a day. Some days I will gorge and eat \~3000 calories a day in junk.

\* Getting physically active, I really like the idea of lifting weights and getting stronger, and also being flexible and running

\* Stopping vaping/smoking/dipping

\* Better sleep hygiene

\* Better budgeting. I have +$1500 in credit card debt that I am desperately trying to pay off but a lot of my money goes to fast food as I don't have motivation to cook. I have been better about it though and have paid off $500 in the past month.

\* Treat my skin

\* Being generally cleaner

\* Being a generally better person. Less anxious, depressed, and irratible. 

\* Stop being extremely shy and timid

\* Invest in myself via hobbies, more educated media (not stupid YouTube and video games), and life experiences.

ok so idk if im losing it or what but i (32f) been married to my husband (36m) for 4 yrs and idk who the fuck i married anymore. so hes always had this weird fetish he told me about where he wanted to pee on my face during segggs and i was like no. just NO. never been into that shit. he asked a few times, i always shut it down, he never pushed it so i thought that was the end of it. i was wrong.

few months ago i started noticing my food tasting weird. not like bad like rotten but just off. like my overnight oats, my yogurt bowls, sometimes my brewed coffee. i thought maybe the fridge was fucking up but everything else was fine. i threw out so much shit thinking it was spoiled but then it kept happening. but heres the thing i never got sick. no stomach aches, no nothing. so i started thinking maybe he was like poisoning me slowly or idk, trying to drug me or something. but it wasnt even making me sick so it made no sense. i was just stressed af. Also like why would he drug me. hes always loving so it wasn't making sense. 

told my friend abt it and she was like u need to put a camera on ur fridge. just in case. Because its just him and i living alone. Only other person coming over is our moms sometines. so i did put the camera cus i was losing my brain. got a tiny one from amazon, set it up, waited. 

this man. MY HUSBAND. PEEING IN MY OVERNIGHT OATS. and my brewed coffee. took the lid off. PEED. put the lid back. SHOOK IT. put it back in the fridge like nothing happened. i thought i was gonna throw up right there.

i LOST it. i went full psycho. i broke his ps5, his tv, threw his clothes outside in the snow, messed up his shoes, EVERYTHING. he came home and i just screamed at him. he started crying begging saying it was his fetish and he thought it was a way to do it without me knowing. like wtf??????? like does he think that makes it BETTER???? he said he will go to therapy, we can put cameras all over the house, he will never do it again. was saying we took vows and we have to work thru this. like???????

Saw these people on tiktok advice asking on reddit so here i am needing that outside perspective. im at my friends place rn i havent told anyone else idk wtf to do. hes blowing up my phone saying im ruining our marriage over this “mistake” but like this aint a mistake this is like. fucking vile. and i cant look at him the same. am i the asshole for wanting to divorce or should i try to forgive him. bc i really just want to vomit forever.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1iqio3r,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1iqio3r/emergency_alert_fall_asleep_before_10_pm_the/,Emergency Alert : Fall asleep before 10 PM | The Bedtime Signal,"I used to think bedtime was just a routine—something we all had to do, a simple part of life like eating or brushing your teeth. Every night, it was the same: wash my face, change into pajamas, climb into bed, and turn off the lights. Nothing special. Nothing to be afraid of. If anything, bedtime was boring, a mindless transition from one day to the next.

But that was before the emergency alerts started.

It began last week, just a little after 9:50 PM. I was lounging in bed, lazily scrolling through my tablet, half-watching some video I wasn’t even paying attention to. The night felt normal, quiet, the kind of stillness that settles after a long day. But then, out of nowhere, every single screen in my room flickered at once. My tablet. My phone. Even the small digital clock on my nightstand. The glow of their displays pulsed strangely, like they were struggling to stay on. A faint crackling sound filled the air, like the buzz of static on an old TV.

Then, the emergency broadcast cut through the silence. The voice was robotic, unnatural, crackling with distortion.

***""This is an emergency alert. At exactly 10:00 PM, all electronic devices will emit The Bedtime Signal. You must be in bed with your eyes closed before the signal begins. Those who remain awake and aware will be taken.""***

The message repeated twice, each word pressing into my brain like a weight. Then, without warning, the screen on my tablet went black. My phone, too. Even the digital clock stopped glowing, leaving the room eerily dim. A moment later, everything powered back on, as if nothing had happened. No error messages. No explanation. Just back to normal.

At first, I thought it had to be some kind of elaborate prank. Maybe a weird internet hoax or some kind of system glitch. But something about it didn’t feel right. The voice had been too… deliberate. Too cold.

Then I heard my mom’s voice from down the hall.

""Alex! Time for bed!""

She sounded urgent—too urgent. This wasn’t her usual half-distracted reminder before she went to bed herself. There was an edge to her voice, a sharpness that made my stomach twist. I swung my legs off the bed and peeked out of my room.

Down the hallway, I saw her and my dad moving quickly. My mom was locking the front door, double-checking the deadbolt with shaking fingers. My dad was yanking cords out of the wall, unplugging the TV, the microwave, even the Wi-Fi router. It wasn’t normal bedtime behavior. It was like they were preparing for a storm.

""What’s going on?"" I asked, my voice small.

They both looked up at me, and the fear in their eyes hit me like a punch to the chest. My dad stepped forward, his face grim.

""Don’t stay up past ten,"" he said, his voice tight. ""No matter what you hear.""

I wanted to ask more, to demand answers, but something in their expressions stopped me cold. Whatever was happening, it was real. And it was dangerous.

I went back to my room, my parents' warning still fresh in my mind. I didn’t know what was happening, but their fear had seeped into me, wrapping around my chest like invisible vines. Swallowing hard, I slid under the covers, pulling the blanket up to my chin as if it could somehow protect me.

I checked the time. **9:59 PM.**

One minute.

The air felt heavier, thicker, like the room itself was holding its breath. Then, I heard it.

At first, it was so faint I almost thought I was imagining it. A whisper—so soft, so distant, like someone murmuring from the farthest corner of the house. But then, the sound grew louder, rising from my phone. It wasn’t a notification chime or a ringtone. It was… wrong. A high-pitched, eerie hum that sent a ripple of cold down my spine. My tablet buzzed with the same noise. So did my alarm clock. My laptop, even though it was powered off. Every screen. Every speaker. Every single electronic device in my room was playing it.

The sound wasn’t just noise. It was *alive.*

And underneath it… something else.

A voice.

It was buried beneath the hum, layered so deep I could barely hear it, but it was there. Whispering. Speaking in a language I didn’t understand. The words slithered through the noise, soft but insistent, like they were meant just for me.

I wanted to listen.

Something about it pulled at me, like a hook digging into my mind, reeling me in. My heartbeat pounded in my ears, my fingers curled against the sheets. If I focused, maybe—just maybe—I could understand what it was saying.

But then my dad’s warning echoed in my head.

***""No matter what you hear.""***

I clenched my jaw, shut my eyes, and forced myself to stay still. My body was tense, every muscle screaming at me to move, to run, to do *something*. But I stayed frozen, gripping the blankets like they were my last lifeline.

Then, just as suddenly as it had started… it stopped.

Silence.

I didn’t open my eyes right away. I lay there, listening, waiting for something—*anything*—to happen. But there was nothing. No more whispers. No more hum. The room felt normal again, but I wasn’t fooled.

Eventually, exhaustion won. I drifted off, my body giving in to sleep.

The next morning, I woke up to sunlight streaming through my window, birds chirping outside like it was just another ordinary day. My tablet was right where I left it. My phone showed no weird notifications. The world kept moving like nothing had happened.

But I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was *wrong*.

That night, at exactly 9:50 PM, the emergency alert returned.

*""This is an emergency alert. At exactly 10:00 PM, all electronic devices will emit The Bedtime Signal. You must be in bed with your eyes closed before the signal begins. Those who remain awake and aware will be taken.""*

The same robotic voice. The same crackling static. The same uneasy feeling creeping over my skin.

I watched as my parents rushed through the house, their movements identical to the night before—checking locks, closing blinds, making sure everything was unplugged. My mom’s hands trembled as she turned off the lights. My dad barely spoke, his jaw tight.

But tonight, something inside me was different.

I wasn’t as scared.

I was *curious*.

I wanted to know why.

What was The Bedtime Signal? What would happen if I didn’t close my eyes? Who—*or what*—was speaking beneath the hum?

So when the clock struck ten, and the eerie hum filled my room again, I didn’t shut my eyes right away.

I *listened*.

The whispering was clearer this time. The words still didn’t make sense, but they sounded closer, like whoever—or *whatever*—was speaking had moved toward me. My skin prickled, my breaths shallow.

Then, from somewhere beneath my bed, the wooden frame creaked.

I stiffened.

A single thought echoed in my head: *I’m not alone.*

I held my breath, my heart hammering against my ribs. Slowly, cautiously, I turned my head just enough to see the edge of my blanket. The whispering grew louder, pressing against my ears like cold fingers.

And then—

A hand slid out from the darkness under my bed.

Long fingers. Pale, stretched skin. Moving with slow, deliberate intent.

Reaching for me.

A strangled gasp caught in my throat. My body locked up, every instinct screaming at me to run, to scream, to *do something*. But I couldn’t. I was frozen in place, my eyes locked on the thing creeping toward me.

Then—*I slammed my eyes shut.*

Darkness.

The whispering stopped.

Silence swallowed the room. The air around me felt charged, like something was waiting. Watching.

I lay there, unmoving, not even daring to breathe. I don’t know how long I stayed like that. Maybe seconds. Maybe hours. But eventually, exhaustion pulled me under.

When I woke up, sunlight spilled through my curtains, and the world outside carried on like normal. But I knew—*I knew*—it hadn’t been a dream.

My blanket was twisted, yanked toward the floor, like something had grabbed it during the night.

I should have told my parents. I should have *never* listened.

But I did.

And the next night, I listened again.

This time, I did more than listen.

I **opened my eyes**.

I shouldn’t have. I **know** I shouldn’t have. But it was a cycle—an endless loop you just can’t break free from.

I **opened my eyes**.

And something was staring back at me.

At first, I couldn’t move. My breath hitched, my body frozen as my vision adjusted to the darkness. But the shadows at the foot of my bed weren’t just shadows. A shape crouched there, its form barely visible except for two hollow, glowing eyes. They weren’t like normal eyes—not reflections of light, not human. They were empty, endless, as if I was staring into something that shouldn’t exist.

Its mouth stretched too wide. Far too wide. No lips, just a jagged, gaping line that seemed to curl upward in something that was almost—but not quite—a smile. It didn’t move. It didn’t blink. It just **watched me**.

Then, it whispered.

*""You're awake.""*

Its voice wasn’t loud. It wasn’t a growl or a snarl. It was soft, almost amused, like it had been waiting for this moment.

The signal cut off.

The hum stopped.

The room was silent again.

The thing under my bed was gone.

But I knew—it hadn’t really left. It was **still there**, hiding in the shadows, waiting for me to slip up again.

The next morning, my parents acted like nothing had happened. My mom hummed while making breakfast. My dad read the newspaper, sipping his coffee like it was any other day. They didn’t notice the way my hands shook when I reached for my spoon. They didn’t notice the way I flinched when my phone screen flickered for just a second, as if **it** was watching me through it.

But then, I looked outside.

And I noticed something.

The street was lined with missing person posters.

At least five new faces.

All kids.

They stared back at me from the faded, wrinkled paper—smiling school photos, names printed in bold. I didn’t recognize them, but somehow, I knew. They had heard the whispers too.

They had stayed awake.

And now, they were **gone**.

That night, I made a decision.

I didn’t go to bed.

I couldn’t.

I **needed to know** what happened to the ones who were taken.

So when the emergency alert played at 9:50, I ignored it. My parents called for me to get ready, but I just sat there, staring at my darkened phone screen. I didn’t lay down. I didn’t shut my eyes.

When the clock struck **10:00 PM**, the hum returned.

This time, it was different.

It wasn’t just a noise. It was **angry**.

The whispers grew louder, pressing against my skull, twisting into words I almost understood. The air in my room grew thick, suffocating. My skin prickled with something worse than fear—something ancient, something **hungry**.

Then—

The power went out.

Not just in my room. Not just in the house.

The entire street went dark.

For a few terrifying seconds, there was nothing but silence. Then, the first **creak** broke through the blackness.

Something moved in my closet.

The door **slowly** creaked open—just an inch.

A long, pale arm slid out.

It wasn’t human. Too thin, too stretched. Its fingers twitched as it reached forward, curling in invitation.

*""Come with us,""* the whispers said.

I bolted.

I ran out of my room, my heartbeat slamming against my ribs. But the second I stepped into the hallway, I knew something was **wrong**.

The house wasn’t the same.

The walls stretched higher than they should have, towering above me like I was trapped inside a nightmare. The doors—my parents’ room, the bathroom, the front door—were **too far away**, like the hallway had doubled in length.

I turned toward my parents’ room, my last hope—but the door was open, and there was **nothing** inside. Just blackness. No furniture, no walls. Just **emptiness**.

The whispers closed in.

I turned—

And **it** was there.

The thing from under my bed.

Its face was inches from mine, those hollow eyes swallowing every sliver of light. I felt its breath against my skin—**ice-cold**, reeking of something **old**, something **dead**.

*""You stayed awake,""* it whispered.

Its mouth curled into that **too-wide smile**.

*""Now you are ours.""*

I tried to scream. I **tried**.

But the sound never came.

The last thing I saw was its mouth stretching **wider, wider, wider**—until it swallowed everything.

Then…

**Darkness.**

I woke up in my bed.

For a brief, flickering moment, I thought maybe—just **maybe**—it had all been a dream.

Then, I got up.

I walked to the kitchen.

And I realized something was **wrong**.

The house was silent. Too silent.

My parents weren’t there.

I called out for them, but my voice barely echoed in the emptiness. Their bedroom was still there, but the bed was untouched. The lights were on, but everything felt **hollow**, like a perfect set designed to look like home but **not** *be* home.

Then, I stepped outside.

More missing person posters covered the street.

But this time—

**My face was on them too.**

The world went on.

People walked past me. Cars rolled by. Birds chirped, the wind blew, and everything continued like I wasn’t even there.

Like I had never been there at all.

I tried to speak to someone—to my neighbors, to a passing stranger—but no one looked at me. No one **saw** me.

No one **heard** me.

I was still here.

But I wasn’t **real** anymore.

And tonight, when the emergency alert plays at 9:50 PM…

I’ll be the one whispering under **your** bed.",2,1739674791.0,creepypasta,1,1.0,False

I shouldn’t have. I **know** I shouldn’t have. But it was a cycle—an endless loop you just can’t break free from.

I **opened my eyes**.

And something was staring back at me.

At first, I couldn’t move. My breath hitched, my body frozen as my vision adjusted to the darkness. But the shadows at the foot of my bed weren’t just shadows. A shape crouched there, its form barely visible except for two hollow, glowing eyes. They weren’t like normal eyes—not reflections of light, not human. They were empty, endless, as if I was staring into something that shouldn’t exist.

Its mouth stretched too wide. Far too wide. No lips, just a jagged, gaping line that seemed to curl upward in something that was almost—but not quite—a smile. It didn’t move. It didn’t blink. It just **watched me**.

Then, it whispered.

*""You're awake.""*

Its voice wasn’t loud. It wasn’t a growl or a snarl. It was soft, almost amused, like it had been waiting for this moment.

The signal cut off.

The hum stopped.

The room was silent again.

The thing under my bed was gone.

But I knew—it hadn’t really left. It was **still there**, hiding in the shadows, waiting for me to slip up again.

The next morning, my parents acted like nothing had happened. My mom hummed while making breakfast. My dad read the newspaper, sipping his coffee like it was any other day. They didn’t notice the way my hands shook when I reached for my spoon. They didn’t notice the way I flinched when my phone screen flickered for just a second, as if **it** was watching me through it.

But then, I looked outside.

And I noticed something.

The street was lined with missing person posters.

At least five new faces.

All kids.

They stared back at me from the faded, wrinkled paper—smiling school photos, names printed in bold. I didn’t recognize them, but somehow, I knew. They had heard the whispers too.

They had stayed awake.

And now, they were **gone**.

That night, I made a decision.

I didn’t go to bed.

I couldn’t.

I **needed to know** what happened to the ones who were taken.

So when the emergency alert played at 9:50, I ignored it. My parents called for me to get ready, but I just sat there, staring at my darkened phone screen. I didn’t lay down. I didn’t shut my eyes.

When the clock struck **10:00 PM**, the hum returned.

This time, it was different.

It wasn’t just a noise. It was **angry**.

The whispers grew louder, pressing against my skull, twisting into words I almost understood. The air in my room grew thick, suffocating. My skin prickled with something worse than fear—something ancient, something **hungry**.

Then—

The power went out.

Not just in my room. Not just in the house.

The entire street went dark.

For a few terrifying seconds, there was nothing but silence. Then, the first **creak** broke through the blackness.

Something moved in my closet.

The door **slowly** creaked open—just an inch.

A long, pale arm slid out.

It wasn’t human. Too thin, too stretched. Its fingers twitched as it reached forward, curling in invitation.

*""Come with us,""* the whispers said.

I bolted.

I ran out of my room, my heartbeat slamming against my ribs. But the second I stepped into the hallway, I knew something was **wrong**.

The house wasn’t the same.

The walls stretched higher than they should have, towering above me like I was trapped inside a nightmare. The doors—my parents’ room, the bathroom, the front door—were **too far away**, like the hallway had doubled in length.

I turned toward my parents’ room, my last hope—but the door was open, and there was **nothing** inside. Just blackness. No furniture, no walls. Just **emptiness**.

The whispers closed in.

I turned—

And **it** was there.

The thing from under my bed.

Its face was inches from mine, those hollow eyes swallowing every sliver of light. I felt its breath against my skin—**ice-cold**, reeking of something **old**, something **dead**.

*""You stayed awake,""* it whispered.

Its mouth curled into that **too-wide smile**.

*""Now you are ours.""*

I tried to scream. I **tried**.

But the sound never came.

The last thing I saw was its mouth stretching **wider, wider, wider**—until it swallowed everything.

Then…

**Darkness.**

I woke up in my bed.

For a brief, flickering moment, I thought maybe—just **maybe**—it had all been a dream.

Then, I got up.

I walked to the kitchen.

And I realized something was **wrong**.

The house was silent. Too silent.

My parents weren’t there.

I called out for them, but my voice barely echoed in the emptiness. Their bedroom was still there, but the bed was untouched. The lights were on, but everything felt **hollow**, like a perfect set designed to look like home but **not** *be* home.

Then, I stepped outside.

More missing person posters covered the street.

But this time—

**My face was on them too.**

The world went on.

People walked past me. Cars rolled by. Birds chirped, the wind blew, and everything continued like I wasn’t even there.

Like I had never been there at all.

I tried to speak to someone—to my neighbors, to a passing stranger—but no one looked at me. No one **saw** me.

No one **heard** me.

I was still here.

But I wasn’t **real** anymore.

And tonight, when the emergency alert plays at 9:50 PM…

I’ll be the one whispering under **your** bed.",4,1739674733.0,scarystories,1,1.0,False

At eight my father took his life and since I have had generalised anxiety and depression.(Probably genetic too)

At fifteen I began using drugs to self medicate. I continued this thru my twenties until getting clean at 33. At 27 I had a bleeding stomach ulcer but as far as I know it healed.


At 35 I got HPV and also SCM neck pain very intense. Constantly since then. I was diagnosed with forward head posture. I've been managing with massage and exercise but still painful.

In the last few years I have experienced great work stress as a carer , and the death of my girlfriend to alcoholism. I spent a year trying to nurse and save her. She died two years ago and I have had increased panic attacks since then.

Two years ago I started seeing stars and aura now and then. I got diagnosed with migraine. Got MRI they found a few scattered FOCI of White Matter Hyperintensities.

Then one year ago I woke up one morning and got up, but fell back down.i couldnt move. It was terrifying. It lasted five to ten minutes. I finally got up and then it happened again. I went to hospital, they diagnosed BPPV. 

I was highly irritable in hospital that night...and felt like my whole body was on fire. It was uncomfortable.

Every since that day I have had blurred and snowy vision, nausea, off balance, vertigo, fatigue, brain fog and irritability. I went to vestibular physio who disagnosed Vestibular Migraine.

I got another MRI about two weeks after. they said same as the one a year before.

I have seen many different GPs who have done blood tests and X ray of neck. All normal.

I finally saw another vestibular physio has recommended my GP get a USS scan of my neck vessells, and another MRI. I'm hoping the neck scan will find whatever is going on for me.

Today I felt fine til I went into town to wait for coffee. Then it all kicked in....out of body feeling, dizziness, fatigue, irritability, exhaustion etc.it sort of feels like a flu virus sensation churning through me but it's pretty much everyday.

I'm getting so sick of this I am wanting to kill myself.

I'm just hanging on today to get scans tomorrow and hopefully I can get an answer.

Please can anyone help .

1iqikpr,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Special-Half-8499/comments/1iqikpr/expose_me/,#Expose Me,"The studio lights were harsh, reflecting off the polished floor and the nervous sweat beading on Joshua Carpenter's forehead. He adjusted the camera lens, focusing on the nude model, a statuesque blonde named Anya, draped across a velvet chaise lounge. He gave her a professional nod and clicked the shutter. *Click. Click. Click.* He was good at his job, damn good. He knew Jess hated it, though. He pictured her outside in the car, probably scrolling through Instagram, a frown creasing her brow. He always assumed it was insecurity, but he was a loyal man. And the money was good, really good. It afforded them a comfortable life, a life Jess seemed less and less appreciative of these days. He thought back to their early days, their whirlwind romance in photography class. He’d been captivated by her fiery spirit, her infectious laughter. She’d seen something in him too, a quiet intensity, a shared artistic passion. They were inseparable then, two halves of a whole.

""That's a wrap, Anya,"" Joshua announced, lowering his camera. Anya smiled, a practiced, professional smile, and quickly wrapped herself in a silk robe. Joshua exchanged polite goodbyes with the studio staff, his mind already on Jess. He was actually excited to see her. He still loved her, even if things had been strained lately. He clung to the hope that they could recapture the spark they once shared. He exited the studio and spotted her car, a sleek, black SUV, parked a little further down the street than usual. He walked towards it, a knot tightening in his stomach. Something felt off. He couldn't place it, but it was there. Jess was inside, slumped against the headrest, her eyes closed. She didn't acknowledge him as he got in.

""Hey,"" he said, leaning in for a kiss. Jess turned her head slightly, offering a perfunctory peck on the cheek. ""Long day?""

""You could say that,"" she replied, her voice flat.

The drive home was silent, an uncomfortable silence that stretched on and on. Joshua kept glancing at Jess, trying to decipher the shift in her demeanor. She seemed distant, preoccupied. Finally, he couldn't take it anymore.

""Jess, what's wrong?""

She sighed, a long, drawn-out sigh. ""Joshua,"" she began, her voice trembling slightly, ""I don't think this is working anymore.""

His heart pounded in his chest. ""What are you talking about?""

""I'm not happy,"" she said, her eyes welling up with tears. ""I haven't been happy for a long time.""

He felt a surge of anger, mixed with a deep, aching sadness. ""Is this about my job? Because you know I do this for us.""

""It's not just your job, Joshua. It's… it's everything. We're not the same people we were when we got married.""

""So, what, you're just giving up? After all this time?""

Jess took a deep breath. ""I've been seeing someone else,"" she confessed, her voice barely a whisper.

The world seemed to tilt on its axis. ""Seeing someone else?"" he repeated, the words hollow. ""You asked for an open relationship, remember? I said no.""

""That was different,"" she retorted, her voice rising. ""That was about *you* wanting to sleep with other people. This is about… about connection. Something I don't feel with you anymore.""

He stared at her, speechless. The anger was gone now, replaced by a crushing wave of despair. ""So, that's it? You're just… leaving?""

Jess nodded, tears streaming down her face. ""I'm moving out,"" she said. ""I've already found a place.""

Joshua watched as Jess pulled out of the driveway, the taillights of her SUV disappearing into the night. He sat there for a long time, the silence broken only by the sound of his own ragged breathing. The knot in his stomach had unraveled, leaving a gaping hole in its place. He felt empty, hollowed out. He couldn't bring himself to move. He just sat there, in the darkness, as the weight of his broken marriage crashed down on him.

The house was silent, suffocatingly so. Joshua wandered through the rooms, each one a testament to a life now shattered. He sank onto the living room couch, the cushions still bearing the faint imprint of Jess's body. He fumbled for his cigarettes, the familiar ritual a small comfort in this unfamiliar territory. He lit one, the cherry glowing in the dim light, and inhaled deeply. Music drifted from the speakers, a playlist he and Jess used to enjoy. Now, each note was a sharp pang of loss, a reminder of shared moments now tainted with bitterness.

He needed to talk, to hear a voice other than the ones echoing in his head. He scrolled through his contacts, his finger hovering over Tristan's name. Tristan, his old college buddy, the life of the party, always ready with a joke and a listening ear. He hadn't spoken to him in years, caught up in the whirlwind of his career and his marriage. He hesitated, a wave of self-pity washing over him. Who was he to burden Tristan with his problems? But the silence was unbearable, a crushing weight on his chest. He pressed the call button.

""Josh! It's been years, man! Holy smokes, bro!"" Tristan's voice boomed through the speaker, a blast of unexpected cheerfulness. Joshua felt a flicker of warmth, a momentary reprieve from the darkness.

""Hey, Tristan,"" he mumbled, his voice thick with emotion.

They exchanged pleasantries, catching up on years of missed moments. Tristan, ever the optimist, painted a picture of his life, filled with adventures and successes. Joshua listened, a hollow ache in his chest. He couldn't muster the energy to reciprocate, to pretend that his world wasn't crumbling around him.

""So,"" Tristan said, his voice dropping slightly, ""how's Jess?""

The question was like a punch to the gut. ""She's gone,"" Joshua said, the words catching in his throat.

""Gone? What do you mean?""

""She left. Said she wasn't happy. Found someone else.""

A stunned silence followed. Then, Tristan's voice, filled with concern, ""Josh, I'm so sorry, man. But you know what? Screw her. She doesn't deserve you.""

""I guess I wasn't good enough,"" Joshua said, the words heavy with self-blame. He started to analyze their relationship, seeing it through Jess's eyes. He saw his own shortcomings, his preoccupation with work, his inability to truly see her needs. He saw the resentment building, the spark fading. He saw his own role in their demise.

""Don't you dare blame yourself,"" Tristan interrupted, his voice firm. ""You're a good man, Josh. Loyal, hardworking, kind. She's the one who threw it all away.""

""But maybe she was right,"" Joshua argued, his voice cracking. ""Maybe I wasn't what she needed. Maybe I was too focused on my career, on providing for us, that I forgot about… about us.""

""Listen,"" Tristan said, his voice softening, ""you can't blame yourself for her choices. You gave her a good life, you were faithful, you loved her. Sometimes, people just… drift apart. It doesn't mean you're not worthy of love, Josh. It just means you haven't found the right person yet.""

Joshua closed his eyes, the image of Jess's tear-stained face flashing before him. He felt a surge of anger, a bitter taste in his mouth. But underneath it all, there was a deeper pain, a sense of loss that threatened to consume him.

""I don't know what to do,"" he whispered, his voice raw with emotion.

""Just breathe, man,"" Tristan said. ""Take it one day at a time. Lean on your friends, let us be there for you. And remember, you deserve to be happy. Don't let her take that away from you.""

Joshua hung up the phone, Tristan's words echoing in his mind. He took another drag of his cigarette, the smoke swirling around him like the chaotic thoughts in his head. He was lost, adrift in a sea of despair. But somewhere deep down, a tiny ember of hope flickered. Maybe Tristan was right. Maybe this wasn't the end. Maybe it was just the beginning of something new.

Tristan's words were a lifeline, a reminder of a time when life was simpler, wilder, and filled with the reckless abandon of youth. They'd been inseparable since grade school, partners in crime, always pushing the boundaries and testing the limits. Their teenage years were a blur of legendary parties, impromptu road trips, and close calls that still made them laugh, even years later.

There was the time they'd ""borrowed"" Tristan's older brother's car for a joyride, ending up stranded in a cornfield after a failed attempt to jump a ditch. Or the infamous New Year's Eve party where they'd rigged the sprinkler system to spray champagne, resulting in a chaotic, bubbly free-for-all. And who could forget the ill-fated camping trip where they'd accidentally set fire to their tent while attempting to cook a gourmet meal over an open flame?

They'd shared it all, the triumphs and the mishaps, the laughter and the tears. They were more than just friends; they were brothers, bound by a shared history and an unspoken understanding.

But as they grew older, their paths diverged. Joshua found stability in his marriage and his career, while Tristan continued to embrace the unpredictable, chasing adventure and pushing the boundaries of convention. Joshua had watched from afar, a mixture of admiration and trepidation. He envied Tristan's freedom, his carefree spirit, but he also feared it. He'd seen firsthand the dark side of recklessness, the potential for self-destruction that lurked beneath the surface.

He'd had his own brushes with excess, experimenting with drugs and alcohol in his younger years. He'd managed to pull back from the brink, finding solace in Jess and his photography. But the memories lingered, a shadow of doubt that haunted him. He worried that reconnecting with Tristan would reawaken those dormant demons, that he would be pulled back into a world he'd worked so hard to escape.

He knew he needed Tristan's support now, more than ever. But he also knew the risks. He was walking a tightrope, balancing his need for connection with his fear of losing everything he'd built.

Joshua stared at the ceiling, the shadows dancing in the dim light. He couldn't shake the feeling of emptiness, the hollowness that Jess had left behind. He needed to get out of the house, to escape the memories that clung to every corner. He picked up his phone and dialed Tristan's number.

""Hey, you busy?"" Joshua asked, his voice still heavy with sadness.

""Nah, just chilling,"" Tristan replied. ""What's up?""

""I need to get out of here,"" Joshua said. ""Want to grab a drink?""

""Absolutely,"" Tristan said. ""I know just the place. It's got great music, cheap drinks, and plenty of… distractions.""

They met at the bar, a dimly lit, lively spot with a mix of music and chatter filling the air. Tristan, ever the extrovert, was already working the room, charming the bartender and making friends with a group of women at the next table. Joshua, still feeling the weight of his recent heartbreak, was more reserved, observing the scene with a mix of amusement and apprehension.

As the night wore on, the alcohol flowed, the music pulsed, and the conversation grew louder. Tristan, fueled by his usual exuberance and a few too many shots, was in his element, regaling the women with outlandish stories and hilarious impersonations. Joshua, despite his initial reluctance, found himself drawn into the energy of the room, laughing at Tristan's antics and enjoying the company of the women.

At one point, Tristan, in a moment of playful mischief, challenged Joshua to a dance-off. Joshua, surprised by the sudden challenge, hesitated for a moment before accepting, a grin spreading across his face. They took to the dance floor, two friends letting loose, their bodies moving to the rhythm of the music, their laughter echoing through the bar.

The night was a blur of music, laughter, and conversation. As the bar began to empty, Joshua and Tristan found themselves chatting with two women, their conversation flowing easily, their connection growing stronger. The women were witty, intelligent, and just as fun-loving as Joshua and Tristan.

The laughter faded, the music died down, and the warmth of the bar gave way to the cold, harsh light of reality. Joshua had sought solace, a brief respite from the pain, but the world wasn't done with him. The whispers started again, louder now, more insistent, weaving their way into his thoughts, twisting his memories, reshaping his very being. He hadn't expected the world to turn against him, to conspire to break him down, to mold him into something unrecognizable, something no human could fathom. He didn't know it yet, but the transformation had begun. The cracks were widening, the darkness seeping in, and Joshua Carpenter was slowly becoming a monster.

The silence was a suffocating blanket, broken only by the frantic thump-thump-thump of Joshua's heart against his ribs. He lay rigid in bed, eyes wide, staring into the oppressive darkness. It wasn't the absence of sound that chilled him, it was the *presence* of something else, something just beyond the threshold of hearing. Then, a whisper, like a breath against his ear, slithered into his consciousness. *Joshua…* it hissed, a distorted, malicious echo of his own name. He was alone, utterly alone, yet the feeling of being watched, scrutinized, judged, was visceral, suffocating. He wasn't sure if he was hearing it or feeling it, but the whispers were there, weaving themselves into the fabric of his sanity.

He bolted upright, heart hammering against his ribs, and stumbled towards the bathroom. The fluorescent light flickered to life, casting a sickly glow on his reflection. He stared at his own image, searching for something, anything, that would explain the gnawing unease that had taken root in his soul. His eyes seemed darker, more hollow, and a faint tremor twitched at the corner of his mouth. A new mark, like a faint bruise, marred his arm, but it was gone in the next instant, or so he thought. He felt a creeping dread, the sense of something unseen, something monstrous, growing inside of him.

He stumbled back to bed, sleep now a distant memory. He closed his eyes, and a kaleidoscope of disturbing images flashed behind his eyelids. He was trapped in a labyrinth of whispers, pursued by shadowy figures with accusing eyes. They hurled accusations at him, each word a poisoned dart piercing his flesh. His skin crawled, his body felt heavy, distorted, like it was no longer his own. He woke with a gasp, drenched in a cold sweat, the lingering terror of the dream clinging to him like a shroud. The whispers followed him into wakefulness, their voices growing louder, more insistent, weaving their way into his thoughts, twisting his memories, reshaping his very being.

He stumbled out of bed, driven by a desperate need to escape the whispers, to find some semblance of sanity. He wandered through the silent house, each room a stark reminder of what he had lost. He paused in the living room, drawn to a framed photo of Jess, her smiling face a cruel mockery of his present misery. He picked it up, his fingers tracing the outline of her face, a wave of longing crashing over him. Then, he saw it. A flicker of something in her eyes, a hint of malice that he had never noticed before. He blinked, and it was gone, but the seed of doubt had been planted. Had she always been this way? Had he been blind to the darkness lurking beneath the surface?

As he stood there, lost in a labyrinth of doubt and fear, a chill ran down his spine. He wasn't sure if it was the coldness of the room or something else, something far more sinister. He felt a presence, a malevolent force closing in on him, whispering promises of power and revenge.  The whispers had found their host.

The whispers became a chorus, a cacophony of voices swirling inside his head, each one a shard of doubt, fear, and accusation. They clawed at his sanity, tearing at the fragile fabric of his reality. He clutched his head, trying to silence the voices, but they only grew louder, more insistent.

""Shut up! Shut up! SHUT UP!"" he screamed, his voice raw with desperation.

The photo of Jess slipped from his grasp, shattering against the hardwood floor. He sank to his knees, the broken glass a mirror reflecting his own fractured state.

""Jess!"" he cried, his voice breaking. ""Why? Why did you leave me?""

He lashed out, his fists pounding against the floor, the walls, the furniture. He overturned a coffee table, sending books and magazines scattering across the room. He ripped the curtains from the windows, letting the cold night air flood in. He grabbed a lamp and hurled it against the wall, the shattering glass echoing his own internal chaos.

He was spiraling, losing control, consumed by a grief so profound it threatened to swallow him whole. He sobbed uncontrollably, his body wracked with tremors. He crawled across the floor, the broken glass cutting into his skin, a physical manifestation of his emotional pain. He reached the hallway mirror and slammed his fist against it, the glass cracking and splintering. He saw his reflection, distorted and grotesque, a stranger staring back at him with wild, desperate eyes.

""Why!?"" he screamed at his reflection, his voice cracking with anguish. ""Why did you leave me!?""

Suddenly, a sharp knock on the door startled him. He froze, his breath catching in his throat. The knocking grew louder, more insistent. He stumbled to his feet, his body trembling, his mind racing. He cautiously approached the door, his heart pounding in his chest.

""Who is it?"" he croaked, his voice barely a whisper.

""Police,"" a gruff voice responded. ""Open up.""

He fumbled with the lock, his hands shaking. He opened the door a crack, his eyes widening in surprise. Two uniformed officers stood on his porch, their expressions a mixture of concern and suspicion.

""We received a noise complaint,"" one of the officers said. ""Someone reported hearing screaming.""

Joshua stared at them, his mind reeling. ""Screaming?"" he repeated, his voice hoarse.

""Yes,"" the other officer said, his eyes narrowing. ""A woman screaming.""

Joshua's blood ran cold. ""A woman?"" he whispered, his voice barely audible.

The officers exchanged a look. ""That's right,"" the first officer said. ""Are you alone here, sir?""

Joshua nodded slowly, his mind racing. He couldn't comprehend what they were saying. He had been screaming, yes, but he was a man. He looked down at his hands, his body, searching for an explanation, a sign of the transformation he was undergoing.

""Sir, are you alright?"" the second officer asked, his voice laced with concern.

Joshua looked up at them, his eyes wide with fear and confusion. ""I don't know,"" he whispered, his voice trembling. ""I don't know what's happening to me.""

""Sir, we need to come in and make sure everything is alright,"" the first officer insisted, his hand hovering near his taser. ""It's standard procedure.""

Joshua, still reeling from the revelation about the woman's screams, felt a surge of defiance. ""Don't you need a warrant for that?"" he mumbled, the words tasting like ash in his mouth.

The second officer stepped closer, his gaze unwavering. ""Look, sir, we're just trying to do our job. If you have nothing to hide, you'll let us in.""

He knew they didn't trust him, saw him as a potential threat. The accusation hung heavy in the air, a woman screaming, a woman he hadn't even been with. He felt a surge of anger, a primal urge to lash out, to defend himself against this invisible accuser. But the exhaustion, the emotional turmoil, had drained him. He simply nodded, stepping aside to let them in.

""Wait out here,"" the first officer instructed, gesturing towards the porch. ""Have a cigarette or something.""

Joshua numbly obeyed, lighting another cigarette with trembling hands. He watched as the officers disappeared into his house, their flashlights cutting through the darkness. He felt a strange detachment, like he was watching a scene unfold in a movie, a scene in which he was both the protagonist and the villain. He couldn't shake the feeling that something was terribly wrong, that the world was tilting on its axis, and he was powerless to stop it.

The officers emerged a few minutes later, their faces grim. ""Everything seems to be in order, sir,"" the first officer said, his voice laced with suspicion. ""But we'll be keeping an eye on this place.""

They left, their cruiser's taillights disappearing into the night. Joshua stood on the porch, the cigarette burning a hole in his fingers. He felt a strange mix of relief and dread. Relief that the immediate confrontation was over, dread at the implications of the officers' words, the lingering suspicion in their eyes. And the woman's screams... who had screamed? He hadn't been with anyone. Tristan had, but he was already home, wasn't he?

He went back inside, the silence now amplified by the echo of the officers' footsteps. He began to clean up the mess, the shattered glass, the overturned furniture, the remnants of his breakdown. He turned on the TV, the mindless chatter a distraction from the turmoil in his mind. He flipped through the channels, landing on the local news. A headline flashed across the screen: ""Two Women Missing After Night Out.""

His heart skipped a beat. He turned up the volume, his eyes glued to the screen. The news anchor, her voice somber, reported that two women had been reported missing after a night out at a local bar. They had been seen with two men, but their identities were unknown. The police were asking for anyone with information to come forward.

Joshua's blood ran cold. He recognized the bar, the one he and Tristan had been at. He remembered the two women, their laughter, their easy conversation. He fumbled for his phone, his hands shaking. He dialed Tristan's number, the ringing tone echoing in the silence. It went straight to voicemail. He tried again, and again, but there was no answer. Panic clawed at his throat, a cold dread seeping into his bones. He was caught in a nightmare, a horrifying reality that was rapidly spiraling out of control.

The news report replayed in Joshua’s mind, the faces of the missing women flashing before his eyes. He couldn’t shake the feeling that he was connected to it somehow, that the night at the bar had unleashed something dark and terrible within him. He felt a strange unease in his gut, a twisting sensation that was more than just anxiety. He dismissed it as stress, the lingering effects of the breakup, the police, the news. But the feeling persisted, growing stronger, more insistent.

He went to the bathroom, hoping a cold shower would clear his head. As he undressed, he caught his reflection in the mirror. His skin seemed… different. A faint discoloration, like a bruise spreading across his abdomen. He touched it gingerly, and a sharp pain shot through him. It wasn’t just a bruise. It was something… else.

He leaned closer, his breath catching in his throat. The discoloration was spreading, a sickly purple hue creeping across his skin. And beneath the surface, something was moving. A slow, undulating movement, like something was trying to push its way out. He pressed harder, his fingers sinking into the soft flesh of his stomach. The pain was excruciating, a searing heat that made him gasp.

Suddenly, a memory surfaced, unbidden, from the depths of his past. He was a child, watching in horror as his mother clutched her stomach, her face contorted in agony. The same sickening purple bruising, the same unnatural swelling. Prolapsed stomach, the doctor had called it. He remembered the fear, the confusion, the image of his mother being rushed away in an ambulance. And then, the silence.

He stumbled back from the mirror, his heart pounding in his chest. He felt a wave of nausea, a primal fear gripping him. This wasn’t just a bad dream. This was real. The transformation was happening.

Then, a voice, cold and sharp, echoed in his mind. “He threw me down the stairs.”

The memory intensified, flooding his senses. He saw his mother again, falling, her body crashing against the hard floor. He heard her screams, her cries for help. And then, another voice, a child’s wail, filled with terror and pain. “He killed our baby!”

The pain in his stomach intensified, a searing, tearing sensation. He doubled over, clutching his abdomen, his body convulsing. He collapsed to the floor, the whispers and cries swirling around him, a chorus of torment echoing in his mind. He was changing, becoming something monstrous, something he didn’t recognize. And the voices, the memories, were just the beginning.

The pain was beyond anything Joshua had ever imagined. It felt like something was alive inside him, a parasitic entity writhing and gnawing its way up his body, tearing through muscle and sinew. He tried to scream, but his voice was trapped, choked by the terror and the agony. He felt his body contorting, his muscles spasming violently, his bones audibly cracking and shifting. He was a prisoner in his own flesh, forced to endure this horrific metamorphosis, his consciousness a front-row seat to his own gruesome undoing.

The pressure built, a crushing, sickening force that threatened to rupture him from the inside out. He could feel something moving, slick and wet, slithering upwards like a serpent. Then, it happened. Something burst forth, not from his stomach as he expected, but from his mouth. It wasn't a scream, not a human sound. It was something guttural, demonic, a screech that tore through the silence of the house, a sound that could curdle blood and freeze the heart. It was the sound of something inhuman being violently birthed, a raw, visceral expulsion of something utterly alien. He tasted blood and bile, the coppery tang of his own terror.

And then, mercifully, everything went black.  

He surfaced from the blackness, gasping for air, his body slick with sweat and something else… something viscous and metallic. He was in a nightmare, a swirling vortex of whispers and accusations. Tristan’s voice, usually a source of comfort, echoed through the darkness, twisted and malicious. “Josh? Man, that guy’s a total creep. Remember that time he…?” The lies were outlandish, absurd, yet they burrowed into Joshua’s mind, planting seeds of doubt and self-loathing. Then, Jess’s voice, cold and distant, joined the chorus. “He’s always been weird. I heard he…”. The rumors were more personal, more intimate, laced with betrayal. They painted him as a monster, a predator, a man capable of unspeakable acts. He couldn’t see them, Tristan and Jess, but their voices were omnipresent, a suffocating blanket of lies.

He fought to open his eyes, to escape the torment of their voices. Finally, his eyelids flickered open. He wasn't in his bed. He wasn't even in his house. He was in a room bathed in a sickening red light, the source of which he couldn't discern. The air was thick with a cloying, coppery smell that made his stomach churn. He looked down at his hands. They were covered in blood, not his own, he instinctively knew. He was naked, his body smeared with the same crimson substance.

His gaze drifted upwards, and his blood ran cold. Two figures stood before him, their forms silhouetted against the red glow. He recognized them. The women from the bar. They were… different. Their eyes were wide and vacant, dead white orbs that stared straight through him, yet somehow also seemed to see into the deepest, darkest corners of his soul. Their smiles were fixed, unnatural, a grotesque parody of human expression.

His stomach lurched. He looked lower, and a wave of nausea washed over him. Their abdomens had been crudely opened, the flesh ripped apart. Their wombs were empty, scooped clean. The organs, glistening and grotesque, lay scattered on the floor between them, a horrifying tableau of carnage. Yet, they did nothing. They simply stood there, smiling, their dead eyes locked on his, as if they were waiting for him to do something, to complete some unspeakable ritual. He was trapped in a tableau of horror, a scene so grotesque, so utterly inhuman, that his mind struggled to process it. The whispers intensified, now laced with triumph, as if they had orchestrated this nightmare, as if they had created this monster he had become.

The red room swam before his eyes, the grotesque tableau of the two women seared into his mind. He was trapped, paralyzed by a terror so profound it transcended fear. He tried to scream, but no sound escaped his throat. He tried to move, but his limbs were heavy, unresponsive. He was a prisoner in his own body, forced to witness this horrific spectacle.

Suddenly, a blinding flash of light pierced the darkness, snapping him back to reality. He blinked, his eyes struggling to adjust to the sudden brightness. He was in his bed, the familiar surroundings a stark contrast to the nightmarish scene he had just witnessed. The red room, the mutilated bodies, the dead white eyes – all gone, vanished like a phantom.

He was drenched in sweat, his heart pounding in his chest. He sat up, his body trembling, his mind reeling from the horror of the dream. He looked around the room, half expecting to see the two women standing there, their grotesque smiles mocking him. But there was nothing, only the familiar furniture, the soft glow of the bedside lamp.

He reached for his phone, his hand shaking. He saw several missed calls from Tristan. He quickly dialed the number, his heart pounding with a mixture of hope and dread.

""Tristan?"" he said, his voice hoarse.

""Josh? Dude, what's up? I tried calling you back earlier, but you didn't answer.""

""I was… I had a nightmare,"" Joshua said, his voice trembling. ""It was… horrible.""

""Whoa, easy there, man,"" Tristan said, his voice laced with concern. ""You alright?""

""I don't know,"" Joshua said, his voice cracking. ""I think… I think something's happening to me.""

""What do you mean?"" Tristan asked.

""I don't know,"" Joshua repeated, his mind racing. ""I had this dream, this horrible dream. And… and I think it was real.""

""Josh, it was just a dream,"" Tristan said, his voice soothing. ""You're just stressed out, man. It's been a rough couple of days.""

""No, it wasn't just a dream,"" Joshua insisted. ""I felt it, Tristan. I felt it happening to me.""

""Felt what happening?"" Tristan asked, his voice laced with confusion.

Joshua hesitated, unsure how to explain the horror he had experienced. ""I… I don't know,"" he stammered. ""I can't explain it.""

""Just take it easy, man,"" Tristan said. ""Get some rest. We'll talk about it tomorrow.""

""Yeah, alright,"" Joshua said, his voice barely a whisper.

He hung up the phone, his mind still reeling from the nightmare. He couldn't shake the feeling that it was more than just a dream, that it was a premonition, a glimpse into the dark transformation that was taking place within him. He was changing, becoming something monstrous, something he didn't recognize. And he was terrified.

The lingering dread of the nightmare clung to Joshua like a shroud. He woke up feeling exhausted, his body heavy, his mind clouded with disturbing images. He knew he couldn't go to work, not in this state. He needed time to process what had happened, to understand the strange transformation he was undergoing. He called his boss, Mr. Thompson, hoping to take a sick day.

""Thompson, it's Joshua,"" he said, his voice hoarse. ""I'm not feeling well. I don't think I can come in today.""

""Carpenter, this is really bad timing,"" Thompson said, his voice tight. ""We've got that big shoot today, the one with the cosmetics company. We're already short-staffed.""

""I know, I'm sorry,"" Joshua said, ""but I really don't feel up to it. I think I might be getting sick.""

""Well, you should have thought of that before,"" Thompson snapped. ""We're counting on you, Carpenter. You know how important this contract is.""

""I understand,"" Joshua said, ""but I really can't come in. I'm not feeling well at all.""

""Look, Carpenter,"" Thompson said, his voice hardening, ""I'm not going to force you to come in. But if you don't show up today, you can consider yourself fired.""

Joshua was taken aback. ""Fired? Just like that?""

""That's right,"" Thompson said. ""I've had enough of your excuses. You've been unreliable lately, always taking time off. I need someone who's going to be here, someone I can count on.""

""But I've always been a good worker,"" Joshua protested. ""I've never missed a shoot before.""

""That's not true,"" Thompson said. ""You missed that shoot last month, the one with the swimsuit models. You said you had a family emergency, but I later found out you were just hungover.""

""That was one time,"" Joshua said, his voice rising. ""And it wasn't a family emergency. It was a personal issue.""

""Whatever it was, it cost us money,"" Thompson said. ""And now, this. I'm done with you, Carpenter. You're fired.""

""You can't do this,"" Joshua said, his voice trembling with anger. ""You can't just fire me like that.""

""I can and I am,"" Thompson said. ""And don't bother coming back for your things. I'll have them sent to you.""

The line went dead. Joshua stared at the phone, his mind reeling. He couldn't believe what had just happened. He had been fired, just like that, without any warning. He felt a surge of anger, a burning resentment towards Thompson, towards the world, towards everything that had gone wrong in his life.

Then, a new thought crept into his mind, a dark suspicion that made his blood run cold. He remembered the two women from the bar, the ones who were now missing. He remembered the way Thompson had said he'd had enough of his excuses. He remembered the look in Thompson's eyes, a mixture of anger and disgust. He wondered if Thompson knew something, if he had heard something about what had happened at the bar. He wondered if the reason he was being fired was more than just a missed shoot. He wondered if it had something to do with the missing women, if someone had accused him of something… something foul. The thought made his stomach churn. Had one of the models said something? Accused him of something he didn't do? The whispers in his mind grew louder, more insistent, weaving a narrative of guilt and suspicion. He was being framed, he was sure of it. But by whom? And for what?

The phone slipped from Joshua's grasp, clattering to the floor. Fired. The word echoed in his mind, a death knell to any semblance of hope he still clung to. He was losing everything. His wife, his job, his sanity. The whispers intensified, feeding on his despair, painting him as a failure, a monster, a man deserving of nothing but pain. He felt a crushing weight on his chest, a suffocating despair that made it hard to breathe. What was the point anymore? He was alone, broken, and utterly lost.

He stumbled into the bathroom, his reflection in the cracked mirror a grotesque caricature of himself. His eyes were bloodshot, his face pale and gaunt. He looked like a stranger, a man he didn't recognize. He stared at his reflection, a wave of self-loathing washing over him. He couldn't do this anymore. He couldn't bear the pain, the whispers, the constant fear that he was losing his mind.

He reached into the medicine cabinet, his hand trembling. He pulled out a bottle of pills, his fingers fumbling with the child-proof cap. He stared at the pills in his palm, small and white, a promise of oblivion. He brought them to his lips, his eyes closing. He was ready to give up, to surrender to the darkness that was consuming him.

Suddenly, a searing pain ripped through his abdomen, doubling him over. He gasped, the pills scattering across the floor. It wasn't like the earlier pain, this was sharper, more intense, like something was tearing him apart from the inside. He clutched his stomach, his body convulsing. He felt something moving inside him, something alien and terrifying. It was like the nightmare, the feeling of something being birthed from within.

He stumbled back from the mirror, his eyes wide with terror. He looked down at his stomach, and a wave of nausea washed over him. The skin was distended, stretched taut, and beneath the surface, he could see something moving, writhing. It was a grotesque, pulsating mass, pushing against his flesh, trying to break free.

The pain was excruciating, a burning, tearing sensation that made him scream. He fell to his knees, his body wracked with spasms. He felt like he was being ripped apart from the inside out, the monster within him struggling to escape. He was trapped, a vessel for something inhuman, something that was slowly, violently, taking over his body, his mind, his very soul. The pills, the despair, the self-destruction – all forgotten in the face of this new, unimaginable horror. He was no longer in control. He was becoming something else, something terrifying, and there was nothing he could do to stop it.

The morning sun streamed through the gaps in the drawn curtains, casting long, distorted shadows across the living room floor. Tristan stood on Joshua's porch, knocking insistently. ""Josh? You in there, man?"" He'd been trying to reach Joshua all night, a growing unease gnawing at him. Josh hadn't answered his calls, and something about their last conversation, the sheer terror in Josh's voice, had Tristan worried sick. He pounded on the door again, his knuckles white. Silence.

""Josh, come on, man, open up!"" He rattled the doorknob, finding it locked. He hesitated, a bad feeling settling in his gut. ""Oh buddy,"" he muttered, ""I'm sorry for this one."" He stepped back, took a deep breath, and kicked the door with all his might. The wood splintered, the door crashing inward with a resounding bang.

Immediately, a piercing alarm shrieked through the house, startling Tristan. He hadn't expected that. He stumbled inside, the sight that greeted him making his blood run cold. It wasn't just messy. It was… a massacre. The walls, the floors, the furniture – everything was covered in blood. Thick, dark, crimson blood. It was splattered, smeared, tracked across the carpet in grotesque patterns. The air was heavy with the coppery scent of it, a sickeningly sweet odor that made his stomach churn.

""Josh! Josh, are you here?"" He called out, his voice trembling, his eyes darting around the room, searching for his friend. He stepped carefully through the carnage, his shoes crunching on shards of glass and… something else. He didn't want to think about what it was.

""Josh, answer me!"" He moved through the house, his heart pounding in his chest, each room a scene of unspeakable horror. He found the overturned coffee table, the shattered lamp, the broken mirror in the bathroom – all bathed in blood. He reached the bedroom door, his hand shaking as he pushed it open.

""WHAT THE FUCK!""

Tristan recoiled, his stomach lurching. He stumbled back, his hand flying to his mouth. He barely made it to the hallway before he vomited, the contents of his stomach heaving onto the blood-soaked carpet. The scene in the bedroom was beyond anything he could have imagined, a tableau of unimaginable gore. He couldn't bring himself to look again, but the image was seared into his brain, a nightmare made real. He knew, with a certainty that chilled him to the bone, that Joshua was gone. Not just gone from the house, but gone from this world, consumed by something dark and monstrous.

Tristan stumbled back, his stomach heaving. He couldn't bring himself to look into the bedroom again, the image of what he'd seen burned into his mind. But he had to. He had to know. He took a shaky breath and forced himself to turn back, his eyes scanning the room, searching for Joshua.

And then he saw him.

Random no display, fans and RGB led lights still on, boots normally into windows","-So, this part may be unrelated- but there's been some weird behavior goin on with my PC. Starting last week, soon after the newest windows 11 update, my external WD 12tb HDD would not connect. I chalked it up to the power cable or the USB, since I knew the slot got kinda damaged from the cable getting hit before. OK, I put it on my shelf for now, to test with new cables or shuck later on. Not sure if this is at all related to the next series of events, but I'd thought I'd mention it.

 Today, I went to get coffee and when I returned to my computer, and tried to move the mouse to wake up the ""sleeping"" displays, nothing happened. Tried pressing keys, it was pretty much unresponsive. Led lights and fans were still running though, normal rpm. Had to force it to shut down. When I booted it up again it took a lil bit longer, and actually, it went to the windows startup repair screen! I went ahead and progressed like normal, booting into windows., and it seems everything still works normal. All internal drives seemed to be connected. RAM was fine still running full speed on that XMP profile. Opening up multiple windows and videos, played fine on all 3 monitors. Booted up some counterstrike, that ran fine too. Though I didn't check temps, (I know, I def should've) I thought it might've been a windows bug with the sleeping displays, so I turned off that setting. I went right back to work. A couple hours later it happened again! Same deal. Turned it off to deal with later, but this time I think I noticed a faint smell! Pretty sure It came from my PC, but since I was busy atm I couldn't pin down where/which component it was, or if it was a bug 🤣, I just turned it off, switched off the PSU and unplugged everything to deal with later tonight

It is now later tonight, and I'm currently cleaning it up and dusting all the fans. I was wondering what initial troubleshooting steps I should take? Thanks in advance 🙏🏻

Col Dubois watched the progress of her Marine boarding parties with a mix of suspicion and disbelief. Resistance seemed to have collapsed after *Achilles* rammed the alien vessel, and something didn’t feel right. After such tenacious resistance, for the aliens to just give up seemed out of character. *Maybe it’s not out of character,* Dubois thought. *Maybe their ship is more damaged than it looks, or maybe they suffered a lot of casualties in the collision*. The problem with the casualty theory was the boarding parties weren’t finding very many alien bodies. All the passages were empty, save a few random aliens manning control stations periodically through the passages. Those aliens didn’t try to fight, didn’t even acknowledge the Marines presence. In one instance, the Marines had passed right by the alien and it hadn’t reacted. 



“Where did they all go,” Dubois wondered aloud.



“Probably to the planet,” Major Jameson replied, sipping at his tea.



“All of them?” Dubois was skeptical.



“The Navy has tracked over ten thousand objects leaving the alien vessel and dropping toward Crescent 3,” Jameson replied. “Not all of them made it.”



*Ten thousand… that would be close to the complement of a battlecruiser, wouldn’t it?* Dubois pursed her lips and turned to the holographic tactical map of the alien vessel. Most of her teams were moving along the outer hull, traveling along corridors that seemed to run the length of the vessel. A few teams were pushing towards the middle of the alien vessel, guided by Marine officers back here in the Combat Center. These teams weren’t finding anything either, not even aliens moving to evacuate. It just didn’t make sense…



“Contact!” The voice of Captain Frank came over the loudspeakers. “Let ‘em have it!”



Dubois searched the monitors and found Captain Frank’s video feed. A group of wasp-like aliens were arrayed in front of Frank and his five Marines, gnashing their mandibles and moving forward towards the intruders. Behind them, shapes moved in the darkness of a large room. Automatic systems dampened the sound of the weapons as Frank’s team opened up with all five machineguns. The screeches of wounded bugs filled the comms, and Dubois watched as Frank and his men were forced back into the corridor.



“I think we found the aliens,” Jameson said quietly.



Dubois nodded, checking the tactical map. “Can we get any other teams down there?” She asked the Marine Combat Coordinator.



“I can try,” he replied. “But we don’t know where the corridors are until a team goes through them.”



“Do your best,” Dubois ordered, returning her gaze to Captain Frank and his firefight.



Captain Frank and his men were holding their own, now that they had pulled back into the corridor where they could bottleneck the aliens. On the tactical map, Dubois could see a team of reinforcements coming up behind with more ammunition. Another Marine team leader shouted an expletive, and Dubois searched the screens. She found the other team fairly quickly, and the reason for the Marine’s consternation. On the screen, the Marines' helmet-mounted lights showed an enormous alien, easily three times the size of the warriors they had been fighting earlier. Clustered around it were dozens of the smaller, wingless aliens as well as a dozen wasp-like aliens. The warrior aliens were moving to engage the Marines, while the other aliens milled around the feet of the large alien. The image darkened as the Marines were forced back into the corridor, the warriors using their front legs to shield their heads from the concentrated fire of the Marines’ automatic weapons. It wasn’t wholly effective, and Dubois saw two alien warriors fall before the Marines were pushed back to the point the camera could no longer show what was happening in the large room.



“You know,” Jameson commented coolly. “If these aliens were like wasps, I’d say we just found a queen in the center of the hive.”



Dubois wondered why she hadn’t thought of that before now. The alien vessel *was* shaped like a giant, flying wasp’s nest; and at near enough the center they had found a large alien that was being defended heroically by the others.



“Redirect all boarding parties to that room,” Dubois ordered.



“Yes, Ma’am,” answered the Combat Coordinator. He began directing teams to follow passages that looked like they might lead to the central room on the alien ship.



Dubois watched the tactical map as more Marine boarding parties converged on what she hoped was the control room of the alien vessel. On the view screens, Captain Frank was making headway now that reinforcements had caught up with him. The other team was struggling, but the aliens didn’t seem to be trying to overrun their position. It seemed as if they were trying to hold them back from entering the room with the ‘queen’.  Another team reached the alien control room via a third corridor, and was met by a wall of the wingless aliens. The Marines fired into the smaller aliens, but the aliens kept charging. They didn’t have the sharp double mandibles of the warriors, but once they got within reach of the Marines they reached out with their manipulators and tried to disarm the Marines. Another team arrived, and met yet another group of smaller aliens. Dubois could see the Marine boarding parties were gradually getting the upper hand on the tactical map as more and more Marines arrived. Captain Frank and his Marines finally burst into the room, having blasted their way through the final warrior that was blocking the way. Dubois watched in fascination as smaller aliens did their best to form a protective barrier between the queen and the Marines; but the Marines were tired of the firefight. A cloud of grenades were flung at the massed aliens, and explosions ripped apart the smaller workers. The giant queen staggered, having suffered from the shrapnel of the blasts. Other Marine teams entered the room and they all poured automatic weapons fire into the queen. It shrieked and beat the air with its forelegs until finally collapsing under the fusillade. As the queen died, so did any further resistance. The remaining worker aliens and warriors suddenly seemed lost and confused, wobbling on their legs unsteadily. The Marines pressed the attack, but Dubois saw several cameras shift to weird angles. She searched the view screens and realized all the camera views from the team leaders were titled at strange angles.



“What’s going on,” she asked the Combat Coordinator. “Why is everything tilting in different directions?”



“I don’t know Ma’am,” the Combat Coordinator replied. “It looks like they might be floating in zero-g now.”



Dubois looked closer and saw that the Marines were struggling to engage the remaining aliens because every time they fired they were being pushed around by the recoil. It took a few minutes, but finally the last wingless alien went limp under the fusillade of small arms fire and a silence settled over the scene.



“Command,” came the voice of Captain Frank over the speakers. “We’ve lost artificial gravity. I don’t know about atmosphere; but we’ve taken this central room. No controls that I can see, just a whole lot o’ passages going all different directions. Please advise.”



The Combat Coordinator glanced back at Dubois.



“Have them secure them room and standby,” Dubois ordered, walking over to ship phone on the wall.



“Hive mind?” mused Jameson.



Dubois nodded, picking up the phone and asking for the admiral.

  


Admiral Vong’s gravelly voice came over the line. “What have you got, Dubois?”



“I think we’ve secured a central control room, admiral,” Dubois replied. “Resistance collapsed with the death of what I think was their leader. Can you tell me if the alien vessel has stopped maneuvering and firing?”



Admiral Vong was silent for a moment, probably querying his staff. “You’re right,” he answered. “No guns or thrusters are operating that we can see; however, they’re launching a whole lot more of those drop pods. Seems they’re abandoning ship. Have you found where they’re coming from?”



Dubois shook her head as she answered, “We haven’t found any launch bays or escape pod chutes.”



“See if you can’t find where these bugs are coming from,” ordered Admiral Vong. “I’d like to shut them down before they get their entire complement onto the planet.”



“Aye aye, sir,” Dubois answered, and the line clicked off. She replaced the phone on the wall and met Jameson’s curious gaze. “They’ve stopped moving and firing the point defense; but they’re evacuating to the planet faster.”



“Curious,” remarked Jameson, finishing the last of his tea. “That means if they are a hive mind, they have a new leader or leaders. Probably on the surface.”



“Probably,” Dubois agreed. She turned to the Combat Coordinator. “Have the boarding teams search the alien vessel, moving along the outer passages. We want to find where the drop pods are coming from and shut them down.”



“Yes, ma’am,” the Combat Coordinator answered, turning and relaying the orders to the Marines on the alien vessel.



“And start bringing the wounded and dead back to *Hermes*,” Dubois ordered.



The Combat Coordinator acknowledged the order, and soon the representations of the Marines on the alien vessel began fanning out through the passages connected to the central control room.



“I’d be curious to know just how many aliens this hive ship carries,” Jameson commented quietly. “They’ve launched nearly fifteen thousand drop pods already; and they’re still launching.”



Dubois looked at her XO, wondering where he was getting these numbers. She followed his gaze to the Naval Communications Officer’s control station. Amidst the clutter of other information, there was a small window labeled ‘bogey count’ and a number rapidly ticking up. She wondered if that was something the Naval Communications Officer normally had on their control station, or if it was something they had up out of curiosity. Her attention was dragged back to the view screens by a sudden burst of gunfire over the speakers. She searched the screens, noting the strange angles made it more difficult to determine what was happening. Her eyes were drawn to muzzle flashes, and the sound of a S.A.W. thundered over the speakers even with the automatic reduction in sound. As it ceased, the angry humming noise from the first engagements came over the speakers and the shapes of wasp-like alien warriors loomed on the screen.



“Requesting backup,” called the Marine platoon leader over the comm link. He sounded tired and was panting slightly. “We’ve found a large concentration of alien fighters. They seem to be defending this position like the control room.”



“Roger that,” answered the Combat Coordinator, ordering two nearby teams to move towards the embattled Marines.



“I wonder if the teams are starting to suffer from zero-g sickness,” mused Jameson.



Dubois nodded. The first boarding parties were probably getting close to the halfway point on their air supply as well. She picked up the ship phone and asked for the admiral again. After a brief pause, Admiral Vong answered.



“What do you got, colonel?” 



“Sir, I’m going to need to start rotating my boarding parties back for air replenishment. Have you heard how the ground battle is going? Dubois asked.



Admiral Vong let out a sigh. “Nothing definite. The Planetary Defense Forces are scouting out the landing area where the drop pods have been landing; but nothing concrete. Has their ground commander been updating you on their force deployment?”



“Negative, sir,” Dubois answered, keeping her voice neutral. “He told me he would be in tactical and strategic control of all forces on the planet’s surface, and he is senior to me in rank.”



“Hmph,” snorted Admiral Vong. “I hate politics. How many Marines have you sent down so far?”



“I’ve deployed about two battalions to the surface,” Dubois answered. “The Buffalos are almost back for another load.”



Admiral Vong grunted. “Well, if he’s going to play power games then I say go ahead and prioritize your boarding parties. Sounds like things are getting off to a slow start down there anyway. General Strong will be here within an hour, and then he can take over dealing with the ground invasion. Any luck on finding the alien launch bays?”



“Possibly,” Dubois answered. “We have run into spirited resistance in an exterior corridor, which might lead to an evacuation area. I’m pushing more teams to break through as quickly as possible.” Dubois was grateful that Admiral Vong was making the decision to cut off the support for the ground defense. Even though she was a Stellar Marine officer and Colonel McCaffrey was a Colonial Adminstration officer, if she decided to withdraw support from the planet on her own it could be construed as insubordination. 



“Very well,” Admiral Vong said. “Keep up the pressure. If we can capture the launch bays, we’ll hamstring the ground invasion before it gets started.”



“Yes, sir,” Dubois replied gratefully as the line clicked off.



“Good news,” Jameson inquired, taking a sip of a fresh cup of tea.



Dubois wondered if he carried extra tea bags in his uniform pockets, as there was only a coffee pot available in the Combat Control Center. *Does he make his tea with coffee*, she wondered curiously as she replaced the ship phone. “Yes,” she answered. She turned to the Marine Communications Officer, “Tell the Buffaloes they’re back to transporting Marines to the alien vessel.” Turning back to Jameson she continued, “We’ve been ordered to stop the aliens from getting to the surface by taking the launch bays or whatever they’re using to send pods to the surface.”



“Good show,” Jameson answered. “Do we have any clue as to how many of these bays there are?” He angled himself to glance over at the Naval Communications Officer as he asked the question.



Dubois looked at the Naval officer as well, “Lieutenant, is there any information on where the aliens are launching drop pods from?”



The Naval Communications Officer typed into their terminal for a few seconds before responding. “Not anything definite,” he answered. “I can link the battlecruisers' sensors to your tactical map, but it’s not as detailed information as your teams are transmitting. There might be general areas to focus on, but that’s the best I can do.”



Dubois watched as the hologram of the alien vessel blinked a couple of times, then a swarm of tiny red dots appeared around outer portions of the alien hull. They did not move as seamlessly as the representations of the Marine boarding parties, instead seeming to jump about. It took Dubois a few seconds to realize the indicators of the alien drop pods were updating much slower than the Marines' transmitters, and the steady stream of drop pods leaving the hive ship were leaving the range of her tactical map before the updates came through. She pursed her lips and moved closer, studying the hologram and its spasmodic representation of the alien drop pods for a minute before she finally noticed a pattern. One of the areas that appeared to be where the drop pods were coming from was only a few yards from where the Marine Platoon was in contact with alien warriors.

  


“Control,” she ordered. “Direct the boarding parties towards these areas.” She indicated three areas on the alien hive ship’s hull where she guessed the drop pods were launching from.



The Combat Coordinator looked at where she was indicating, then replied, “Yes Ma’am.” 



“Interesting how much lag there is with all these fancy systems,” commented Jameson. “Top notch sensors and computers, but it still takes time for them to communicate.”



Dubois nodded silently. It was a disadvantage she was used to when deployed to the surface of a planet, since any information from Navy sensors had to travel through a planet’s atmosphere to her mobile command post. She hadn’t realized how bad coordinating information was just between the ships of the Task Force. She divided her attention between the tactical hologram and the view screens receiving the views of the platoon leaders of the boarding teams. Despite more boarding parties converging on the Marines in contact, they were making no progress in breaking through the aliens guarding access to the suspected launch bays. Other boarding parties ran into similar difficulties approaching the other suspected launch bays, being stopped cold by stout resistance from the aliens. 

Dubois flinched as she watched a Marine in the first team to come into contact fumble a live grenade. The Marine scrambled to recover, or maybe smother the blast with his own body; but it went off before he could get to it. Several Marines screamed in pain as shrapnel tore through their vacuum rated body armor, and bloody droplets started appearing in the zero-g environment. The aliens sensed an opening, and improbably launched their own attack. Dubois watched with growing dread as the aliens propelled themselves into the wounded Marines, tearing them apart with their vicious mandibles. The platoon leader emptied his carbine at the head of an alien tearing limbs off of an incapacitated Marine, struggling to push himself backwards with the uninjured members of his team.



“TALKING GUNS!” Screamed the panicking platoon leader as he struggled to reload. A moment later, a S.A.W. opened up, spraying through the cluster of Marine and alien bodies. As soon as it ended, another S.A.W. opened up and was joined by a couple of carbines. The screams of injured Marines, either being hit by friendly fire or torn apart by alien mandibles came through the speakers only partially muted by the noise suppression systems. Several members of the Combat Control team had lost color in their faces, hands clenched in frustration as they watched or listened to the carnage. The Combat Coordinator nearly shouted into his headset, trying to break the platoon leader out of his panic.



“Lieutenant Sims! Reset your marines! Get control of the situation! LIEUTENANT SIMS! REGROUP YOUR MEN!” The Combat Coordinator looked as if he wanted to reach through the view screen and shake the panicking lieutenant by the shoulders.



Major Jameson stepped up to the Combat Coordinator and tapped him on the shoulder, motioning for a headset. The Combat Coordinator picked up a spare headset, turning it on and setting it to the correct frequency before handing it to the major. Once the headset showed up as connected on the Combat Coordinator’s screen, he signaled Major Jameson with a thumbs up. Major Jameson motioned with his hand, signaling for the Combat Coordinator to take the frequency off the speakers. Once this was done, he started talking.



“Lieutenant Sims,” Major Jameson said in his calm, Oxford accent. “You need to get your men braced on the walls of that corridor. The recoil from your weapons is throwing you everywhere. Once you have a grip on the walls like those bugs do, you’ll be able to pull back in good order and set up a defensive position. There’s another platoon coming up to relieve you, you just need to get your men out of there in good order.”



Dubois watched as Major Jameson’s face took on a look of concentration as he listened. The view screen still showed a frantic firefight, the aliens pushing their advantage as they finished working through the wounded Marines. The screen shook as Lieutenant Sims fired his weapon at the oncoming aliens, crawling along the walls of the passage toward the survivors of his team. A marine with a S.A.W. grabbed onto the wall of the passage, taking a moment to brace himself before unloading into the oncoming horrors. His accuracy was much better, and one of the aliens stopped advancing as its face turned to pulp under the fusillade. Other Marines began finding foot and handholds on the walls, but the aliens were advancing rapidly. Lieutenant Sims’ carbine disappeared from view, replaced a moment later by a hand holding a grenade.



“Nice and easy, Sims,” Major Jameson coached. “Do it by the numbers, just like the training simulation. Your men are covering you, just prime and throw.”



Dubois watched in fascination. It almost seemed like the lieutenant went through the process of lobbing the grenade in slow motion as the decimated team around him poured fire into the advancing aliens. The grenade floated through the air, and the lead aliens stopped advancing. They clearly knew what the device was capable of, and it seemed as if they were trying to shield themselves from the blast. 



“Pull back slowly,” Major Jameson said into the headset. “Relief is close behind you. We’re talking them up to you, you just need to let them take the lead when they get there.”



The flash of the grenade's detonation blinded the camera for a moment, then the sight of aliens moving up through the smoke caused Dubois’ breath to catch. But several aliens were wounded, missing limbs or leaking fluids from their thorax. Another grenade, thrown by a different Marine, floated into the oncoming aliens and another explosion obscured the view. The Marines were pulling back slowly, the S.A.W. gunners firing at aliens as they appeared through the smoke and haze. The camera view shook suddenly, and it spun as Lieutenant Sims turned to look over his shoulder. The tinted faceplate of a Marine from the relief team nearly filled the view screen, and the private held a thumbs up in front of his faceplate. The view screen shook up and down as Lieutenant Sims obviously nodded his head, and Dubois heard the platoon leader of the team over the speakers.



“Control, we’ve reached One-Charlie’s position. Passing through now. Let’s see how eager these bastards are to fight now.”



Everyone in the Combat Control Center looked relieved as the fresh platoon moved up, pounding the aliens with fierce determination. Major Jameson took off the headset, turning it off and handing it back to the Combat Coordinator. Lieutenant Sims moved back with the survivors of his platoon, heading back along the passage as the Combat Coordinator directed him to a waiting Bison attached to the alien vessel’s hull. Major Jameson stepped back to his spot in the back of the room, picking up his mug of tea and taking a long sip.



“Nice job,” Dubois commented quietly.



“Thank you,” replied Jameson. “Lieutenant Sims is going to be in a hard place, I’m afraid. Pity, he was a promising officer; but it looks like he was put in command too soon.”



Dubois just nodded. With her background in armoured divisions, she wasn’t sure she would’ve been able to do any better than the lieutenant; and she’d had way more real life experience than Sims had. *Were any of us really ready for this,* she wondered, watching a half dozen desperate firefights playing out on the screens in front of her as her Marines struggled to reach the alien launch bays through valiant resistance. “We’ve got them cornered,” she murmured. “They’ll fight harder now, because they don’t have much left to lose.”

In high school i only went to the bathroom every other day or every 2 days. And I feel like as I get older, it just keeps getting worse. I spoke to my PCP about it and she recommended to take psyllium husk and to increase my fiber intake. I feel like that worked for maybe about a month and then my body got used to it and I had to change things up. So then I’d start drinking really strong coffee and eat dates every day and put ground flaxseed in all my meals. And then after a month it would stop working. So anyways I’ve been dealing with this for a while but it’s gotten to the point where the past two weeks I haven’t been able to go to the bathroom without an enema. And even when I use one, I don’t feel completely emptied. I bought liquid magnesium citrate and it did absolutely nothing.

He says, cokes aren’t gonna cut it today I need something strong. He then tells me to go fetch him some coffee so I oblige.

He initially just let it go and I go round. As rounds were finishing I pass by the nurses station and examine the pot because I was curious at this point. 

Well… it was growing what looked like a colony of fungi when I opened the lid. It looked as if it was about to say grow eyes and say hello to me. And the stench….

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I do not drink alcohol, smoke tobacco, or use any recreational drugs. I drink a lot of coffee, from 4 to 10 cups per day. My eating habits are varied, but usually I only eat one large meal per day in the evening, sometimes a snack in the early afternoon, coffee in the morning and sometimes evening.

Family history of dementia and Parkinson's. I have not had an official autism diagnosis but strongly relate to all the symptoms and the lived experiences of autistic people. I do have CPTSD from multiple and different traumas, lifelong and treatment resistant.

I have been taking tianeptine sulfate for 8 years at 150mg every 6 hours for treatment of permanent PSSD. I have been at this dosage for about 6 years, having built tolerance until finding a suitable maintenance dose. The effects have lessened the last four years, but it still mostly works for what I take it for.

I was recently prescribed generic bupropion HCL XL 150 mg 1 time per day for what seems like an array of symptoms of low dopamine. The prescription recommends increasing to 2 times per day after the first 7 days.

I am concerned about increased seizure risk or CNS depression considering the tianeptine dosage and potential interaction. What are the potential risks and how likely are they?

(Long Post But Worth It)","**How to ACTUALLY Transform Your Physique and Take Back Control of Your Health While Seeing Great Results in The Next 12 Weeks.**

So, if your goal is to **reduce your weight** while also putting on **muscle** at the same time (yes, although a bit more work it CAN be done at the same time) and increase your energy, this may be a long post but I promise you it will be worth it.

By the end of the post, you will have the answers you want to get you out of the feeling of being **plateaued** and to drop the extra 15 lbs or more and **lean out**.

And NO at the end of this post, there will *not* be a link asking you to opt into your email for some weekend warrior course to follow or a link sending you to download a crappy lead magnet that gives you really low-quality information and then tries to get you to sign on to a program.

No this is just going to be put out there for you to gain value from so you can start getting some wins!

But you have to remember one thing.

You **NEED** to apply it and keep applying it consistently every week.

Where there is no consistent action there are no **results**.

But if you just keep working with it, I promise you the **results** will come **through**.

If you’re juggling the demands of a busy professional life, you’ve probably thought about getting back into shape but feel stuck.

Maybe you’ve tried before but didn’t get the results you wanted.

Maybe life got in the way, and you’ve struggled to find the time to focus on your health.

Whatever your reasons, I want you to know it’s not too late to reclaim your health and build a body you’re proud of.

It is never too late. NEVER. The oldest client I had helped was 65 years of age and he improved in all areas of fitness, built muscle, and increased his energy.

So, there is no excuse at all.

This post will outline everything you need to know to start transforming your physique and take back control of your health in just 12 weeks.

You’ll drop those pounds, build some muscle, increase your energy become de-stressed and finally feel as though you can make some real progress.

So, let’s get this going!

I’m gonna start off the bat by saying I have been a fitness/health coach for the past 18 years and I service men online and in person.

But I don’t care about that nor am I writing this for that. It’s just to show that I have some credibility.

I’m here because I just want to provide value.

I generally cater to business owners/corporate ladder-working males who have a hectic lifestyle however anyone can apply these methods.

**Why Most Fitness Programs Fail**

The truth is, that the fitness industry often overlooks the unique challenges faced by men in their 30s, 40s, and 50s.

Generic plans *might* work for you but it may not always be the case.

Actually, more often than not you may get some results but you could be stopping yourself from possibly processing further.

Here’s why:

**One-Size-Fits-All Solutions:**

Most programs don’t consider YOUR specific needs. What you can handle, what your power output for exercises are.

It really does matter that you put some effort into designing a plan that is going to help shape not just your physique, but your **life**.

Just taking any plan off the internet can possibly get you by but you want a plan that’s going to be more **specific** towards your needs.

You are not the same as everyone else and wouldn’t want to have a program suited for you.

Sure, some things might come to be the same. All guys are going to want to do bicep exercises.

But how big do you want your arms to be?

What parts of your body do you want to develop more?

What exercises do you want to put time towards?

How will you develop the exercise part of the program to maximize time if you can only give so much time a day if you’re a busy person?

What foam rolling and stretching techniques will you use to combat inflation? (I see you rolling your eyes, yes this is important especially the more you age).

What are your calories?

What are your macro settings within your calorie intake?  

How much cardio are you applying every week (yes that’s right I said *cardio* the bad C word that you tend to shudder and stay away from, I’ll explain why you should be adding it in and how to do it where it doesn’t feel so dreadful and the importance of it).

And blah blah blah etc.

I could go on; there's quite a bit to go cover.

But this is important to know.

You don’t want cookie-cutter stuff; you want a **specific program** that can work.

But again, don’t worry down below I will have some answers for you as I want to provide solutions.

And NO, I know you’re thinking of skipping, **don’t**. Spend the time to read through this so you get ALL the context and not just some of it.

When you have to fix something in your house needs more than just the usual hammer and nail to fix it, you don’t just bring a few tools you THINK you need, you bring the whole toolbox.

Well, this whole read is your toolbox.

**Lack of Accountability:**

Without someone to guide you and keep you on track, it’s easy to lose motivation and especially direction.

This falls on you to stay **consistent** and be ready. A lot of programs, like ALL of them really, don’t help you to deal with this. This completely falls up to you.

You need to surround yourself with the right information to help you **stay focused** and succeed.

Getting into groups (like the one you joined here, a slight pat on the back for you my friend) helps to keep you focused.

Getting away from people or certain events that could steer you off track could benefit you.

If you are the type to be easily persuaded and have weak resistance then sit out for a while since this is very **important** to you.

Accountability and having no structural habits kill people's momentum and ultimately their results.

Always stay **engaged** in your quest towards your fitness goals, always stay **focused**, and keep your goals in the forefront of your mind.

**Unrealistic Expectations:**

This is a big one that you keep digging yourself a grave into.

You have set these **expectations** for yourself based on someone else’s before and after pictures when you know NOTHING about what they had to go through to get there.

How long it took, what their experience in working out is, what struggles they went through, etc.

But you also can’t be too hard on yourself as truth be told, you probably didn’t know better as you have been sold something different on the internet.

But I am going to tell you it’s not always that simple.

As a **matter of fact**, more often than not it isn’t and then you have to take into consideration that as you start to see results you may hit roadblocks along the way.

People go through different circumstances and **health scares** in life that could derail them or slow them down.

I’ve spent years working with men like you who’ve faced these same challenges.

The key to success isn’t necessarily about doing more; it’s about doing what works for your life.

It’s about incorporating how it can fit your schedule and then **challenging yourself** enough to keep **progressing** but not destroying yourself.

I have found some guys can go balls to the wall even if they are just starting and succeed and get results over time.

But **more often than not** people can’t do that.

You have to be willing; you have to be dedicated; you have to be determined and you have to take action and stay consistent.

But that is a different level for everyone.

You MUST ALWAYS be moving forward with **no excuses** but it should be at a pace you can handle while you don’t bullshit yourself AND while holding yourself **accountable**.

**Knowing your Nutrition**

**Calories:**

The first thing you need to do is learn to measure your calories. Out of anything else, this is the most **important thing**.

What you are going to do is calculate 7 days in a row of EVERYTHING you eat. Doesn’t matter if you eat one meal or 5 meals in a day.

If you undereat or overeat, if it’s junk food or healthy, don’t change anything now because you're conscious of it.

Write everything down and how many calories are in each food you eat.

Write down how many calories you are taking from your beverages as well. Mark everything down.

When you do this, you will be surprised at how much you are actually eating. A lot of people **undercalculate** what they intake, it’s been shown in numerous studies so don’t be so sure that you don’t do it either.

After you have calculated one week's worth and have your rough caloric intake for every day for seven days, you then will add up all seven days and divide it by seven because, well you guessed it, there are seven days in a week!

Now once you have this number, you’re going to drop 300 to 500 calories from that number to be in a deficit.

Because even though your calories may not be consistent every day, we are trying to get you structured and situated where your metabolism gets regulated with the same flow of food intake daily while consistently staying in a deficit.

This also builds a great habit for you to become structured in your approach to your nutrition.

Being in a calorie deficit you will possibly see some energy loss. This can be migrated through some of the foods you intake and also maintaining fiber to around 30g but you will have to play with this a bit, everyone is different.

I can’t tell you how many times different clients have reacted to this when in a weight loss phase. But this is why you have to also give it some time, generally 2 weeks to adapt.

Remember you are taking less food which means less energy. Do your best to eat nutritiously dense foods to stay full when you can but even if it bothers you, you will adapt.

 There are people online now, some with a lot of followers, and think they seem to be in a place or position to say that counting calories doesn’t work.

And I’m going to tell you that is a load of **bullshit**. Yes, it is possible that you don’t have to count calories to have weight loss or even just make healthier choices to get results.

But this is a form of measurement, and what gets measured gets accomplished. It’s another way big way to enable your success.

I can already hear some people complaining now. “Uh but do I really have to? No, you don’t but if you are serious about weight loss or your health in general then why wouldn’t you want to learn something that could help?

If you're already complaining now and don’t want to put in any effort then you don’t care.

And why leave a form of measurement unchecked when it can help get you to the results you want, especially when it’s the most effective method, proven to work, backed by science and biology, and has loads of studies that show its effectiveness?

It’s not even up for argument as it’s just a fact that it works.

**Macros:**

Now that you have the foundation on how many calories you are taking, you need to see how many macros you will be having within that calorie limit.

Higher protein is a must as it aids the most in weight loss and helps with **sustaining muscle** as much as possible when you are in a weight loss phase.

Just note, that if you don’t completely hit these numbers all the time it’s fine. Not every food or meal is going to have exactly the macros you need and your body still utilizes fats and carbs for muscle building as well so don’t sweat it.

Just do your best.

So, you’re going to take your total calorie intake, let’s say it’s 2000 calories for the example and you will divide it by the percentages you give each macro.

2000 calories total

50% protein - 2000 x .50 = 1000

30% carbs - 2000 x .30 = 600

20% fats - 2000 x .20 = 400

Based on the calculations you would be dedicating 1000 calories to protein, 600 calories to carbs, and 400 to fats.

What kind of carbs and fats and protein you need or should be using doesn’t matter as much now.

You just need to focus on bringing down the weight and building some muscle.

Follow the basics first and then you can get into the more in-depth things later on.

But make sure to go based on what you calculated your calories to. And stick to it day after day with **CONSISTENT** effort and putting in the best effort you can.

There will be distractions, and you will have people who try to derail you but if you stay consistent you will see success.

**Cheat Meals:**

I already know what you’re thinking. “But what about cheat meals??” or “There's no way I can give up coffee with cream”.

You don’t have to. No one is saying you need to give it up.

If you CHOOSE to go down a route to eliminate certain foods because you believe it will help you better sustain your ability to stay **consistent** then do so.

This is fine; however, you still need to be in a **deficit**.

Where you have gone wrong before is when you were told you could have a cheat meal right away on the weekend.

You see when you did that you ended up eating the calories you had lost during the week from being in a deficit, or worse, you ended up eating a little more.

People do not understand how having that one meal with several drinks can place you right back into the same position you were just starting a week ago.

So, can you have cheat meals? Of course! But you need to do it strategically.

First off, you can’t eat great and be in a deficit for five days and then overload on the weekend. You always, **ALWAYS** need to be in the form of a deficit to **lose the weight** and continue to do so.

So, you can either do two things here.

You can have the food you want as long as you're in a deficit and you always stay in a deficit.

Or

You eat straight into a deficit for 13 days and then on the 14^(th) day or the next weekend, whatever your schedule permits, you have the meal you have been wanting to have.

This way, even if you go overboard a bit, you have been in a deficit for 2 straight weeks which will still keep you in a deficit even if you happen to have a meal with higher calories.

I mean as long as you're not vacuuming food like you’re at a hot dog-eating competition you’ll be fine.

This is great because it gives you **options** on what route you want to take, be able to enjoy certain foods you like, and still be in a deficit.

Or if you prefer to just stay in a **continued deficit** for longer you can do that too.

I have clients now and have had clients in the past who just enjoy a continued deficit. They prefer the idea of knowing they won’t taste certain foods that will trigger them to want to go and binge eat certain foods.

It really depends on the person but the options are there for you to take.

**Designing Your Weight Lifting Program**

Be honest. How many times have you walked into the gym, looked around, scratched your head, and just decided to try anything that was in front of you?

Or how many basic exercise routines have you used on the internet in the gym and applied haphazardly with no real results?

Probably **several times.**

You left feeling the gym knowing it was an underwhelming workout and you know it yourself.

You don’t want to be feeling as though you left the gym knowing it was just a blah workout.

You want to be **challenged**.

Not *killed* or *destroyed*.

But **challenged**.

Never be scared of that word when it comes to lifting weights and fitness as it will be your best friend in terms of allowing you to grow, **gain results,** and become stronger over time.

**Weightlifting:**

For now, you will dedicate a total of five days to exercise.

Five days?!

Yes, five days.

If you want to start seeing **great results** and put yourself in a position to keep maintaining them you are going to have to challenge yourself.

Remember I said to **challenge** not destroy. And down below I’ll show you how this can be applied for a total of five days of a program without you killing yourself but challenging you enough to keep getting results.

One thing I highly suggest you do is to write everything out.

The program you end up putting together from the information below should be written out so you know **EXACTLY** what you will be doing for the next 3 months.

There is no guessing, no thinking, just **action**, **consistency**, and **results**. That’s it

So make sure to either write it down, put it on your phone or computer, or whatever, just make sure to know exactly what you are going to be doing.

**What Exercise to Do:**

For three days out of the week, you will be doing weight lifting. You can pair any muscle groups together but it must be two of them.

I generally like to do

Chest/back

Legs/Biceps

Triceps/Shoulders

But you can do any combo you want. It’s really up to you.

Spread these out during the week. Something like Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday can work. If your schedule doesn’t allow it because you’re a very busy person then spread them out as best as possible.

**Don’t** stack them three days in a row, spread them out.

**Sets and Reps:**

This is where the **intensity** and building of **muscle** and aid with weight loss comes in.

You want to stay consistent with your repetitions and sets.

Now there are MANY techniques and ways you could go about doing this but again I’m going to simplify it for you to be able to get challenged and then increase with progressive overload and keep getting challenged.

For the first month:

For the first 4 weeks, you are going to aim for 3 sets of 12 to 15 reps.

You are going to do 3 different combinations of exercises by pairing a group together and super-setting them.

As an example, if you were doing chest and back then you can do a barbell chest press and then right after doing a bent-over dumbbell back row. This would count for one set. And aim for twelve to fifteen reps.

For the second month:

For the next 4 weeks, you are going to do three sets of fifteen reps.

You are going to do three different combinations of exercises by again pairing two groups of muscles.

You can keep the combinations the same, or you can change them it’s really up to you.

For the first two weeks, after every three sets, you are going to do one set of a conditioning exercise.

It could be various things such as but not limited to.

Running on the spot, feet switch, various methods of using battle ropes, ball slams, getting on the recumbent bike, going for a jog on the treadmill, etc.

You want to keep a medium intensity when doing these exercises for 45 seconds.

Don’t do this nonchalantly, put a bit of **effort** into it to get your heart moving a bit.

Be the best judge for yourself on what you can do but **challenge** yourself.

For the last two weeks of the second month, you are going to add this in two times. So, you will do three sets of a combination of exercises.

Then do your one 45-second conditioning exercise.

Then, move on to do another three sets of another combination of exercises.

And now complete another 45-second conditioning exercise. It could be the same one or another, that is completely up to you.

For the third month:

For the next 4 weeks, you are going to do three sets of fifteen reps and more. The aim is to try and do more than fifteen repetitions.

If you have noticed for the past two months, we have been building muscle conditioning and also continually challenging your muscles for **growth**.

For the first two weeks of the second month, you are going to add conditioning exercises two times.

For the final two weeks, you will add in a conditioning exercise of your choice after every three sets for the entire session.

**Cardio:**

Now I know you hate cardio. It’s become the bad word to use within the firstness world especially if you are someone who prefers lifting completely.

You may have even been told some garbage like it completely breaks down muscle tissue, which is widely exaggerated as nutrition has a bigger part to play than most people think.

But for you, I want to highly encourage you to add in cardio. If you want to get the full benefits from this and give yourself the best chance of success then add it in.

It’s not just for weight loss purposes, although it will greatly help with this as well.

It’s also beneficial to strengthen your heart which obviously allows you to live longer.

And because you strengthen your lungs further and increase heart strength, you will also notice you can breathe easier and longer.

To me it’s a no-brainer and a win/win for you and the benefits you gain out of it are way worth it.

So, along with everything you are doing listed within the months up above, on two other days, you want to add in cardio.

Now let me be clear here. **EVERYONE** is on a different level on what they can handle with cardio.

You need to listen to your body and do what you can **handle**.

Start off with 10 to 15 minutes of walking on two other days of the week. For the first month.

Speed walking is great, usually a 3.0 to 4.0 speed on a treadmill generally is great to start off at.

Then up that in the second month, add in a light jog every 5 minutes. So, you will walk for five minutes and when you hit that five-minute mark you are going to jog for 20 to 30 seconds.

Repeat this process for 15 minutes.

In the third month, you just want to increase the allotted time from 15 minutes to 20 minutes.

Remember, we are creating progressive overload and continually wanting to challenge ourselves with smaller incremental increases for **growth**.

But **listen** to your body on what you can do and handle.

**The Results of Continued Action:**

So now you have your method to start making progress and getting the success you want when it comes to dropping body fat and leaning out with adding muscle in 12 weeks' time.

I want you to **imagine** you walking home after working out at the gym.

You get inside and go upstairs to change and shower after a good and fulfilling gym session.

As you get into your room, you stop to realize the **noticeable change** you see in certain areas of your body, such as the **weight loss** within your face and neck area and the muscle you have developed in your arms and chest.

You then happen to look over to a picture you have above your bedside with you and some friends. You can see the expression on your face in that picture and remember even though you were smiling you weren’t exactly happy.

You remember the stress you were enduring, the lack of confidence you emanated, and the exhaustion you would feel even from walking up a smaller flight of stairs.

You were never even that big of a guy but you wanted to **lose weight**, you hated not having definition in your physique and didn’t like not feeling as though you didn’t feel your age.

But now, when you look in the mirror, that was something of the past as you have **primed yourself** into the new version of yourself.

One that’s **less in weight**, increased **energy**, increased **strength**, more **vibrant**, and **confidant** too.

Just then your girlfriend opens the door and comes in. You greet her and tell her to come on upstairs into your room.

As she comes into the room to say hi, she notices the results and **smiles** and compliments you on your success so far.

And you realize this is just the start. You are going to blow past this get even **more results** and continue to grow yourself into a better version of yourself every month.

You see this isn’t that far off from you to enjoy. It’s in the near future.

If you stay focused and move towards it.

You now know what you were doing wrong.

You have the methods on what to do for the next three months.

Now you just need to implement them.

You got this. This isn’t something complicated. It just requires consistent effort and discipline to achieve.

And all you literally need to do in order to achieve these results,

If you’re into gardening, you know it’s about time to start your seeds for vegetables like peppers and eggplants, and soon enough tomatoes and cold veggies. Looking at my seed packets today gave me the realization that there are some things I’m just never going to grow. So, I’d love to organize a seed swap…tomorrow. Because why not?! (Plus I’m busy or out of town the next few weekends. And if you’ve never started your veggies from seeds and are curious, I love helping people learn how to get started (though my experience comes from years of trial and error and **lots** of YouTube videos). Either way, feel free to come on by!

I figured somewhere public and located near public transit and with parking nearby would be best.

Here are the details:

**Where**: Sonder Coffee & Tea - 2000 S. Colorado Blvd., Denver, CO 80222 (in Junction Food Hall). This is adjacent to the Colorado Station public transit stop and there’s lots of parking, too.

**When**: Sunday, February 16 from 9a - 12p

**What**: A garden vegetable, herb, and flower seed swap. If you have seeds that you don’t plan to use or have excess of, bring them! Or, even if you don’t have seeds but want to be part of Community, feel free to join! (And everyone should feel free to give of their excess).

**Who**: You, the person reading this. And anyone else you think would be into this.

**How**: Bring little baggies (no judgement) or  envelopes or some other type of container to take away the seeds. 

**Why**: Because gardening is a form of resilience, resistance, and helps create community! (And that’s what I need right now ☺️)

I hope some of you can join!",6,1739672311.0,DenverMeets,0,1.0,False

I've been watching a lot of Charlotte Dobre lately, and I am DYING to know what she would have to say about this one! I consider myself a fairly chill person and not a grudge holder, but even though this all went down about a year and a half ago, I can't ""forgive and forget"" because it is still so comically shocking and absurd to me how all this went down. Maybe I'm petty for holding on to it still- you be the judge. Either way, laugh with me!

A couple years ago, I (26F, then 24F) cat sat for an acquaintance my age, we'll call him Mark (yes, the cat sitting is important, we'll get there). A couple of weeks after that, I learned why he needed a last minute pet sitter: his girlfriend of 5+ years whom he was living with had just left him for another guy. He was DEVASTATED. He's a very private person, but when I found out that he was having such a hard time, I went out of my way to be there and support him. All those nights when the ex would have her new guy over to her and Mark's apartment (they couldn't break the lease), he was at my place. He needed to rant to someone, I was the person. I even let him sleep in my bed and I took the couch because at his place, she had the bed and he was sleeping on the couch, and I told him that whenever he wanted to stay over, it was totally fine, I just wanted him to be able to sleep in a bed sometimes. I didn't expect anything in return except the basic respects one pays a friend, which I think is normal.

Well, fairly quickly, he starts seeing someone else, we'll call her Alex (I was not friends with her before this), and he did the thing where he cut out everyone else in his life and only ever hung out with her.  this included me after 4-ish months of him basically living with me, one of those months in which his cat also lived with me (they had a maintenance problem with the apartment, and the apartment didn't allow cats, why this young lad moved in there with a cat I don't know). I had tried a few times to message saying that it would be great to see him more and I'd love if we could find a time to hang out, no dice. There was an incident where I wound up needing to be there for me as a friend, it was something I could plan ahead for and tried to, and the day of, he stood me up. I told him I was hurt, and he avoided the problem because he's very nonconfrontational, and as a result, he completely avoided me (I don't want to say a coward, but if the shoe fits...). 

Cue The Great Cat Caper. 

As I mentioned, his cat lived with me for a month, and after I had to give the cat back, I was heartbroken and realized how good having a cat was for my mental health. However, the coming summer I was traveling out of state for 2 months for work, and I didn't want to get a cat and then immediately leave. Mark also had a summer program that ran for about a month, so the plan was for me to watch his cat while he was gone, and then he would watch mine. Only after this was established did I then go about adopting a cat. Well, I tried checking in about this, even though he wasn't talking to me because he knew he messed up, but I didn't hear anything until the day before when he told me that Alex was going to watch the cat. Immediately, my heart sank because I knew he was going to bail on watching my cat, so without telling him, I made other arrangements. And this was fine for about a week and a half: Mark left, his cat was in his shared apartment with the ex, Alex was going to feed her, I had my little cat and my own business to mind. Perfect. After that first week and a half, Alex messages me and says she wants to go visit her parents for a few days because it was her birthday, asking if I could watch the cat. Totally fine, I ask the date range in which she will be gone, I get the key from her, I feed the cat for a few days. The day after the last date in the range she offered, she says she is finally coming back into town and will get the key from me. I tell her that I already fed the cat that morning because I had a very busy day that day (which I did, I didn't even have time to eat, if she wanted the key, she could have gotten back on time or at least communicated with me, but no), and I would see about getting her the key when I could. 

Later that afternoon, I get a phone call from Mark's EX-GIRLFRIEND, whom he is still living with. There's an apartment showing for their place at 10 am tomorrow. The apartment doesn't allow cats. Mark is out of state and has the cat there. He's not answering any messages from her (fairly, she isn't great), and she's trying to figure out a plan, she knows I had the cat before and that I am currently the one with the house key, is there any possibility that I can take the cat so they can show the apartment in less than 24 hours? I say short answer yes, long answer call me for details. We work it out because Mark hasn't said a word to either of us. I get a text from Alex saying that she heard what the ex asked me, and ""I'm sorry, but I think that's obnoxious of her."" Unhelpful, if Mark has a problem, he can tell me, it's his cat. So the ex and her new boyfriend and I bundle up the cat and take the cat over to my place, and it truly was the most awkward of times. I was so frustrated with everyone involved except the cat at that point. Now I have two cats that hate each other in my tiny little apartment, if you've ever had to introduce cats, you know how this is, they had separate rooms to minimize damage, but hey, worth it to help a friend, right?

The next morning, I get a message from Mark finally briefly apologizing for standing me up on an important day like he did, and at the bottom, he snuck in an ""oh, and I hear you have my cat."" After weighing the options, he takes me up on my offer to keep the cat with me until he gets back because the apartment showings are too unpredictable. Totally fine with me, I offered, happy to help a friend when he needs it, even if said friend as been acting like an AH as of late.

This is where it gets laughably wild. Around this time, we were working a gig together, and he needed some materials for it. I told our director that I could take his and give them to him when he gets back in to town, I know when he'll be back, I can pass things along when he comes to get his cat. Normal, right? Well, the first day or two after he's back go past, and I hear NOTHING. Weird. I'm going to this gig, and the director is asking me what the deal is, I tell him I don't know, I still have Mark's materials and his cat. After the third or fourth day, this starts feeling ridiculous. So I do what any rational person would do and started a betting ring amongst my coworkers at this gig about when he would finally come get his cat back (and of course, they are all appalled that he just left me with his living creature and didn't say a word.) Remember, I'm leaving for two months, and the day I'm leaving is coming up soon after this gig is done, so Mark doesn't have forever and he knows it...  

One day, I'm at a coffee shop doing some work. I look out the window and I SEE MARK AND ALEX WALKING DOWN THE STREET LAUGHING AND ARM IN ARM. Mark's cat is fully still in my apartment, and I have not heard a THING even addressing the fact that I have his creature, let alone making plans to come get her. Furious. Furious is what I was. Obviously, I tell the people at the gig, oh guess who I saw today! ""Oh, did he finally come get his cat?"" ""Oh. No, he still hasn't said a word to me since he has been back, but he's definitely in town."" It was honestly so funny, people were INVESTED in this saga because Mark's behavior was so mind-blowing, especially because a lot of other people there were pet owners (and courteous, respectful humans). Eventually things need to actually get done for this gig, so the director reaches out to him and either Mark cancels or the director says don't come, I forget which, but now the gig is done and I give the materials back. All of us at the gig lose the bet from my little betting ring, the gig is now over and I haven't heard anything.

 Now we're into double digit days of him being back in town and not talking to me about his cat (let's remember that I went out of my way to bail him out in a pinch). I ran out of the cat's litter that she used. I used mine for my cat instead, which his cat didn't like, so she peed on my bed, and that was the last straw. The next day I caved and texted the most awkward ""...do you want your cat back?"" I could muster because WHY was that a question that even had to be asked!!! He made up some excuse about apartment showings, and I said okay, if it's a problem, I can keep her up until I leave town. He says to me ""no, it's okay, I can just lock her in a closet if people come."" LOCK HER IN A CLOSET. So I then said ...so now you're telling me the showings have nothing to do with it? If you were me and I was you, how would you be feeling about me right now? 

So three or four days after that, he gets his damn cat out of my apartment (and yes, I did make him pay me for the new litter I bought and the load of laundry that I did for my bedsheets). This is two days before I am leaving long term, and he says to me offhandedly, ""Did you figure out what you're going to do with your cat?"". SIR. Mind you, he never actually cancelled on me for watching my cat for 2 months; I'm not an idiot and I knew to be prepared and thankfully I was, but SIR. What he doesn't know: I was filling his cat in on ALL the drama while he was away, so I hope she gave him hell when he got back.

I've seen him since, and I always greet him with a robust and friendly ""Hi Mark! How are you?"" because I know he's too cowardly to not be nice in that moment. I look him right in his eyes and make him sit in that shame for the duration of our conversations, and I know that's exactly what he's doing because I can see the fight or flight response in his face. It's a petty thrill.

That's my story- I have never in my life felt so completely slapped in the face (and such a hard slap) so quickly by someone that I went that far out of my way to be nice to. In retrospect, it's hysterical. Without having his cat, I never would have gotten mine! But WOW, truly, who does that? I will probably be laughing about this until I am old and gray, and I hope some of you lovely potatoes got a good laugh too 🥰",2,1739672083.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False
