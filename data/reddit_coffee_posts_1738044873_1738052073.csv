So, you're planning a trip to France?  Fantastic!  Prepare for delicious food, stunning architecture, and… a unique sense of humor.  French humor isn't always immediately obvious to outsiders, but understanding its nuances can greatly enrich your travel experience and interactions with locals.

This isn't about making fun of French people; it's about appreciating a different comedic style.  Think of it like learning a new language – it takes time and practice!

**Key Characteristics of French Humor:**

* **Subtlety and Irony:**  French humor often relies heavily on subtlety and irony. Jokes aren't always explicitly stated; instead, they're implied through wordplay, sarcasm, and understated delivery.  Don't be surprised if a seemingly innocent comment hides a layer of wit.

* **Self-deprecation:**  The French are masters of self-deprecation. Making fun of themselves, their country, or their habits is common and often considered endearing.  Don't take it personally if a French person jokes about French bureaucracy or bad weather!

* **Wordplay and Puns:**  The French language is rich and nuanced, lending itself beautifully to wordplay and puns.  These jokes often rely on double meanings, homophones, or clever phrasing.  While you might not always ""get"" the joke, appreciating the effort is part of the fun.

* **Satire and Social Commentary:**  French humor frequently tackles social and political issues with wit and satire.  This can be sharp, insightful, and sometimes even provocative.  It's a reflection of a culture that values intellectual engagement and debate.

* **Dry and Cynical Wit:**  Think witty observations delivered with a deadpan expression.  This ""dry"" humor might take a moment to sink in, but the payoff is often worth it.

**Tips for Navigating French Humor:**

* **Pay attention to context:** The setting and the speaker's tone are crucial for understanding the intended humor.
* **Don't be afraid to ask:** If you're unsure if someone is joking, it's perfectly acceptable to politely ask, ""Tu plaisantes?"" (Are you joking?).
* **Embrace the ambiguity:**  Sometimes, the humor lies in the unspoken or the ambiguous.  Don't worry about ""getting"" every joke; simply enjoy the experience.
* **Watch French comedies:**  Immersing yourself in French comedy films or TV shows can help you develop a better understanding of their comedic style.
* **Listen more than you speak:**  Observe how French people interact and respond to humor.


**Examples of French Humor (with explanations):**

While directly translating jokes rarely works, understanding the underlying principles helps.  Imagine a situation where someone spills their coffee. A French response might be a dry, ""Ah, magnifique!"" (Ah, magnificent!), clearly expressing irony. Or, a simple ""C'est la vie"" (That's life) in the face of minor misfortune subtly communicates acceptance and self-deprecating humor.

Ultimately, understanding French humor is about appreciating its subtle nuances, embracing the ambiguity, and recognizing the cultural context. Don't stress about ""getting"" every joke.  Just relax, enjoy the ride, and you'll find yourself laughing along before you know it!  Bon voyage!

With countless options available, finding the perfect one can feel overwhelming. This guide will help you choose the ideal [2 seater couch](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/munich-sofa-white) for your needs, style, and budget.

# 1. Understand Your Space

Before you start shopping, measure your space to ensure the 2 seater sofa will fit comfortably without overcrowding the room. Consider:

* **Compact Spaces:** For smaller rooms, a small 2-seater sofa is an excellent choice to maximize seating without compromising on style.
* **Open Layouts:** In larger spaces, a 2-seater couch can serve as a versatile accent piece or help define zones in an open-plan living area.

**Pro Tip:** Always leave enough space around the sofa for walking paths and other [house furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/), like coffee tables and shelves.

# 2. Match Your Style

Your 2-seater sofa should reflect your interior design style. Here are some ideas:

* **Modern Minimalist:** Opt for sleek lines, neutral tones, and metal or wooden legs. These sofas are perfect for creating a clean, contemporary look.
* **Classic Elegance:** Choose tufted or rolled-arm designs in fabrics like velvet or leather for a timeless appeal.
* **Bohemian Charm:** Add a pop of color or pattern with textured fabrics, such as linen or woven designs.
* **Scandi Simplicity:** A small 2-seater sofa with light wood legs and pastel tones can bring a cozy, Nordic feel to your home.

# 3. Consider Comfort and Functionality

A 2-seater couch should be as comfortable as it is stylish. When choosing a sofa, keep the following in mind:

* **Seat Depth and Height:** Deeper seats are great for lounging, while shallower ones are better for smaller spaces or formal seating.
* **Cushion Fill:** Foam cushions offer firm support, while feather-filled cushions provide a softer, sink-in feel.
* **Upholstery:** Choose durable fabrics like microfiber for homes with kids or pets, or opt for luxurious materials like leather or velvet for a sophisticated touch.

# 4. Budget-Friendly Options

Finding a stylish and functional 2-seater sofa doesn’t have to break the bank. Here’s how to make smart budget decisions:

* **Set a Range:** Determine your budget before you shop to avoid overspending.
* **Shop Sales:** Many house furniture stores offer discounts during seasonal sales or on display models.
* **Opt for Versatility:** A small 2-seater sofa with removable covers or convertible designs can offer more value for your money.

# 5. Placement Tips for Every Room

* **Living Room:** Place your 2-seater couch opposite a coffee table or next to a larger sofa to create a balanced seating arrangement.
* **Bedroom:** Use a small 2-seater sofa at the foot of your bed or near a window to create a cozy retreat.
* **Entryway or Foyer:** Add style and functionality by placing a compact 2-seater sofa against a wall with a console table above it.

# 6. Why Choose a 2-Seater Sofa?

A 2-seater couch is a versatile piece of house furniture that suits a variety of needs:

* **For Small Homes:** Its compact size makes it perfect for apartments or smaller living spaces.
* **For Extra Seating:** It can act as supplementary seating in larger rooms or shared spaces.
* **For Style:** Available in endless designs, a 2-seater sofa can elevate the aesthetics of any room.

**Final Thoughts**

1ibwn6b,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ibwn6b/how_to_approach_talking_to_my_bf_about_some/,How to approach talking to my bf about some issues in our relationship in a way that won't hurt his feelings,"I wanted to post this in relationship advice, but it said that it would be better suited here. Ik its kind of a small issue espacially compared to other posts here, but any advice would be appreciated, thank you.

Me 24F and my boyfriend 37M have been dating for 3 years, living together for 2 years across 2 share houses. I love him, he is very intelligent, kind, loving, and funny, and I do see a future together. We hardly fight, but on the occasion we do it is almost always about this issue/theme that I find hard to explain. I have three examples that I think encompass the spectrum of these discussions;

I think of myself as a clean person, but I do leave some clutter on my desk in our bedroom, and I have a habit of not putting away my washing, just leaving it in the basket, but since this bothers him a lot I have taken to putting the basket in my cupboard which is out of sight. Overall he is a little more clean than me, but I think that in general we have compatible standards of cleanliness, and he agrees on this. The problem is that he often asks me to do chores as I am either about to do them or already doing them, which makes me get no satisfaction from completing the task. For example if he asks me to wipe down the bench as I am doing other kitchen chores or reaching for the cloth it makes me feel as if my autonomy to do the task is taken away, and suddenly it's as if I'm no longer choosing to wipe the bench, but in my head I'm now doing it because he asked me to. This didn't bother me so much at first, but it happens almost every day, and I have tried to explain to him so many times how it makes me feel like I'm just cleaning because he asked me to and not because I chose to. Over time I have started to feel more and more sad every time he asks me to do a chore because I feel like he thinks I'm incompetent, or really messy, or lazy. I have brought it up so many times and he just doesn't recognise when he is doing it. I'm beginning to wonder if he doesn't respect me. I know im a bit ditzy so maybe he just thinks i forgot or that i wont do it. But it makes me just shut down now because i dont know what else i can say that i havent already said. I feel unheard. 

Similarly, I am a little hypervigilant and paranoid at times because I have CPTSD, and am often anxious about people perceiving me. He does this thing where he asks if I have had a shower or have brushed my teeth. Occasionally I miss one of these if I'm busy or having a really bad mental health day, but it's certainly not regularly, and if my breath smells bad I don't mind him telling me quietly so I can take care of it. The issue is that he sometimes asks really loudly, and it's super embarrassing for me if I think that our housemates can hear. Most recently we were at a museum which was very busy and he made a face so I asked what was wrong and he said did you brush your teeth this morning? I felt so humiliated because there were so many people around and I was sure they thought i was disgusting. Once we were out of the gallery I burst into tears, and admitted that I hadn't brushed my teeth that morning, so I was in the wrong, but I still felt humiliated that he said it so loud with so many people around especially since he knows I get so embarrassed about it. He didn't seem to understand, and said that he said it quietly enough that nobody heard, but he didn't whisper it and I'm sure somebody near us would have been able to hear. When he asks me things like about the chores or about my hygiene i dont feel as though hes my partner, it makes me feel like a subordinate which is not hot and honestly it has affected our sex life, and ive tried to explain it but i cant seem to word it in a way that he can understand that doesnt hurt his feelings. I just feel like he is repulsed by me sometimes. He says he loves me, and he thinks I'm sexy and beautiful. But I don't feel sexy. I would never loudly ask him if he's brushed his teeth if he has coffee breath. I feel as if he wouldn't ask his friends or even our housemates about their hygiene, so I don't know. I don't know what it means.

The last example related to this is that I was at my friends potluck (bf was my plus one) and a couple of us including the host had decided to start a dance floor where we would start dancing on the next song and others could slowly join. After we had made the plan, I told my boyfriend that I wanted to dance and asked if he wanted to join me for the next song. He said yes, noticed no one was dancing yet, and then immediately went to the kitchen where there were like 20 people and loudly announced that '(my name) wants to dance, let's start a dance floor'. I felt so humiliated because I only vaguely knew the people in the kitchen and it wasn't my party. A bunch of people turned over to look at me because he had interrupted their conversation. I felt so embarrassed that he loudly announced my name like that. I was like we have to leave immediately, and I grabbed my bag and took him with me. I tried to explain how it was really embarrassing and he didn't understand why we left. His personality is very practical and decisive, and usually I really appreciate his ability to organise and make things happen quickly, but in situations like this again I feel publicly humiliated, but also like my autonomy in a situation that I had under control is undermined. I'm not sure if it's because he underestimates me or because he is genuinely oblivious. I'm not sure what to do, how do I make him understand? I know these are small things, and everything else about our relationship is great, it has just built up over time to feel like he thinks he has a responsibility to constantly remind me of things that i havent forgotten, I feel humiliated in front of people all the time, and feel like he underestimates me. Any help with how to approach these issues would be appreciated.",1,1738050879.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False
1ibwmns,https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/1ibwmns/disappointing_cf_date/,Disappointing CF date,"Just the title. I'm looking for a safe space to vent and what better place than this sub. This guy (36M) and I (34M) matched on an app. I wasn't attracted to his pics but swiped as he openly  stated his CF stance on his profile including vasectomy. And knowing how hard it is to find CF guys I decided to give it a go. After a few weeks of back and forth texting on the app, he asked me for coffee but unfortunately I was just recovering from a cold so I delayed it for another week or so. There were days when I couldn't text him back and after a few days he asked if I was still interested and I said yes let's meet up. If I'm being honest I wasn't excited to meet him even tho the conversation hadn't been bad. I think it was just the lack of attraction but I wanted to give it a chance so I tried to carry on. And today as the time to meet was approaching I was dreading the date more and more and was wishing I could cancel it or he does.. but got  dressed up in the end and showed up. We met at this coffee place. He was kinda dorky looking in person appearance wise like his pic (a part of me had hoped he looks better in person). He wore really thick glasses (which weren't that apparent in his pics) and removed them for a second to wipe them and one second he looked up he was almost cross eyed which was kinda jarring. Anyway I'll spare the details. We had a decent chat for about an hour during which we talked about our careers, travels, hobbies and our reasons for being CF. After which it started to get weird when I broached the topic of attachment styles. Somehow he ended up talking  about his love languages and BDSM fantasies and how he's seeking someone who's into that (I'm strictly not). He sensed my discomfort and said as much and I said yes I don't really do all that. After going in circles for a bit and acting polite, we both knew it was time to wrap it up so we walked out and said goodbyes. Also I should mention  he never got coffee or anything the whole time which was odd, we just sat and chatted the whole time and I was hoping he'd get it at some point. Anyhow I got home and saw his message that he had gotten home, it was nice to meet me but he doesn't think we really vibe. I said likewise and he unmatched me after. He had given me his number earlier but I never messaged him there so our entire convo was on the app itself and the unmatch was the end of it.

I'm kinda bummed I wasted 3 hrs of my evening (1hr of getting ready including commute) when I could've just relaxed after work or gone to the gym and also bec I didn't even want to see him lol. I wasn't invested at all so it's no issue it didn't work out. I know I know I shouldn't have met him if there was no initial attraction but I guess FOMO got to me as I haven't met a CF person in years so I overlooked attraction. Anyway rant over! Would love to hear if this resonated with you or advice on how to navigate this in the future. ",3,1738050813.0,childfree,0,1.0,False

I've always struggled to find wrestling podcasts that are interesting and entertaining, especially AEW focused ones, I'm sure we're all too familiar with the negativity-grift that pervades most of these, so it was massively refreshing to find a podcast that is exclusively about AEW and is consistently hilarious.

They offer a totally unique perspective, and also do a great job of highlighting the right way to criticize wrestling. They are far from purely positive,  but any criticism so obviously comes from a place of love - and a desire to see more of Matt Jackson's body - that it doesn't foster any sort of negativity.

Can anyone relate to this ? If so, do you think this is partly to blame for getting MCAS?

Prior to this my body was under a lot of stress. I can pin point some things I think triggered my problems. I loved my job but I only had around 4 hours sleep everyday, i was absolutely exhausted and also had a real addiction to caffeine ( empty stomach most the day, 20 coffees at least or a shit ton of energy drinks) and was also binge/purging everyday… it was only a matter of time before something happened to me I don’t know how I didn’t assume this before. Forgot to add I was spraying and breathing in UNHEALTHY amounts of hairspray / perfume and fragrances products - how times have changed because I’m now severely allergic💀💀(I’ve now got MCS…. Most life altering condition I’ve ever experienced).

One day I started getting short of breathe randomly at work but ignored it, then had a bad reaction to purging that I’d never experienced before a couple days later, then a few days after that out of the blue I didn’t feel right when I was at work (It was 11am, I’d already had 3 monsters as usual). Hot all of a sudden, headache and dizzy. I then couldn’t breathe properly i thought I was having an allergic reaction. After that I experienced the worst chest pain I’d ever had, fainted and was laying on the floor freezing cold and shaking until the ambulance was called. That’s where this all started for me. No heart attack…. But I know for sure that wasn’t a panic attack. My life changed from then onwards😪",1,1738050188.0,MCAS,1,1.0,False

(Mods, feel free to remove this if it's not allowed here - I'm super new to the whole Reddit thing, so I apologize if this is not the place for such a question. Navigating new waters here!)

For context, I've been doing digital art for over a decade now, and have been with Clip Studio Paint since it was Manga Studio (or something like that). I absolutely love the program and have no plans to cheat on it. I'm fairly advanced in terms of what I do with my art stuff - in addition to digital illustrations, I draw and rig Vtuber models and Live2D animations and work lightly in Blender with hopes to work more in 3D sculpting. I currently own a laptop who can handle a fair amount, and will be upgrading to a more advanced PC as soon as I'm able to fund it. I also have a refurbished iPad Pro, which has been my baby since 2019.

Said baby has unfortunately been slowing down more and more as of late (I've used it very heavily over the years, so it's devastating, but I understand). So I'm in the market for a new pen display, and I'm eyeing a few Huion and XPPEN tablets at the moment. I'm not much of a Wacom guy - my first tablet was a Wacom Bamboo, and it gave me hell, so although I know it's the industry standard, it's just not my vibe. I owned a Huion tablet (no display) before I got my iPad, and I actually really enjoyed it, but both my skills and Huion's products have changed tremendously since then, so I don't want to rely on that experience. 

If anyone has any preference between the two companies or wants to share a particular pen display that they really recommend (or don't recommend) with CSP in mind, I'd be super appreciative! I'm not in need of a massive screen, and honestly don't have the space for a professional size, but it would be cool if I could go a little larger than my current iPad Pro. It'll be used the vast majority at home, but I do some art meet-ups at local coffee shops with friends every so often, so it would be rad if I could tote it around sometimes. I would like it to be able to keep up with Live2D and Blender, and am prepared to pay a little more for that. I'd rather save and invest than go as cheap as possible and be limited in the end. (The tablets I've seen from scouring Reddit are the Kamvas Pro 13 and Kamvas Pro 16 from Huion and the XPPEN Artist 24, but I'm super open to a pretty wide range of options. I just didn't see any specific enough recommendations!)

Thanks so much in advance, and I'm happy to provide any other context that might be needed! I appreciate any potential guidance as I throw myself towards another investment. ",3,1738049918.0,ClipStudio,3,1.0,False

So recently I break up with my ex 7 months ago. No cheating involved, just a lack of Communication, Attention, and maybe Immaturity of me. I tend to not be at her side when she needs me and sleep when we are fighting. I also take her for granted. That maybe makes her lose feeling for me. 3 week after our 2nd break up without any contact with her, I suddenly feel that something is not right and tried to contact her and try to have a closure and talk about why our relationship ends. She accepts it, We talk about it and I try to fix things and see if I can still go back to her. As well I did try to explain that I already realize my mistake and commit that I will change for her because I can’t lose her. But suddenly I was surprised that she open up that we cant go back already because she already has a crush on his classmate. (Note: we are not studying in the same university) So I was shocked about it like… we have been in a relationship for 2 years then she got tend to already have crush in the 1 month time period of out breakup.

In the first 6 months of our break up, I still try to beg, cry, communicate on why did she found another guy that fast and still try to get her back. But in that span of 5 months after our break up, She already tend to loved his classmate that was been in a 5 years relationship. I did a lot of things to change for her, I did reflect on my mistake and learn from it to be the guy that she wants before and maybe she could see that I can change. I became desperate just for her to comeback. But she just told me to stop and blocked me in her social media except ig. I don’t try to talk to her already and try to give her the space she wanted. But I can see her story, notes, and liked post that is pointing out that his crush doesn’t like her back. I still try to not break the no contact rule. Until after 3 weeks, new year past already I notice that I was already unblocked in her social media. She suddenly chatted me that if we could play a game because she is bored. I did play with her but knowing that she is just treating me as a friend.

2 weeks after gaining contact with her again. I try to initiate hanging out with her, she agreed. So we kind of hang out just like only the two of us. Basically like a date, probably. She also mention that she thinks that his crush will not reciprocate her feelings. So she tries to get over it. Fully aware that what we are doing is only a friend things even tho we are exe’s. We still continue to hangout just the both of us like having coffee, rinding a roller coaster and etc… basically hanging out. I’m mindful that I shouldn’t be attached to her because It might just be a false thought that she is still invested in me. But one day after we hangout, I ask her if I can go to her dorm to rest a bit. She agreed. As I lay down on her bed, I was surprised that she also lay down beside me and suddenly hugged me. I was confused at that time and I didn’t know what to do because I know she is just treating me like a friend. So I stood up and tell her I will go already but she suddenly softly said “Do go home” with that my mind just shut off and just tell me that I had a chance again with her. We just cuddle and gave a massage to each other and I basically left her dorm that night.

Everything is going well after that we watch movie online and Have a sleep call. But all of a sudden she became cold towards me again like she tend to gave me the vibes when I was begging for her to stay. My message just kept being seen and basically It’s like I’m like chasing her again until one day, I decide to test if she still cares about me. I basically go to 3 days without contacting her and yeah I didn’t get any initiation from her. So I message her and ask how was her day and she said that she is busy finishing her task because she is going to the bar with her friends later night. So I just let her do her things and try not to distract her. The night after she goes to the bar she post a video that she was in the bar with her friends and it seems that they are some random guys in the picture while knowing they are all girls in the group. Time passed she became more distant toward me and give me the vibes when I was chasing her again and I try to ask what happen and she tells me that she want to lay low about our friendship because she found someone in the bar but there is no something between them now but either way she wants to set boundaries. I was devastated to see this, I ask her about the cuddle and “don’t go home” thing and she just say that “Sorry it don’t mean anything to me It was only maybe a burst of emotions”

So… I was like confused about her setting boundaries like why didn’t she think about that before she cuddles and tell me not to go home.  Like it was also my fault because I still cling to the possibility that there must be a special meaning of all those but why would she do that and suddenly tells me to set boundaries when she only find a new guy in the bar… I’m just seeking any criticism and insight on why would she be like that.

**Is Crushnextdoor. com a SCAM?**

Well, we dove into the feedback from multiple review sites, including Trustpilot, to get the lowdown on what real users are saying about this site.

For those who want a legitimate alternative to CrushNextDoor, check out [our list of the top hookup apps. ](https://ashley25.com)

# 💬 Auto-Responses Galore

One of the most common complaints is the lack of real interactions. Users like Jay R. reported receiving tons of messages, but they all seem suspiciously automated. You keep buying credits just to respond, but the conversations go nowhere.

""When I specified certain location requirements, beautiful women responded, but most had professional pictures. You keep buying credits just to keep talking. That pretty much sums up this site."" – **Jay R.**

# 🚫 Hook, Line, and No Meetups

A recurring issue is that no one seems interested in actually meeting up. Bill C. explains that while the site promises beautiful women, it’s all a front. You’ll get messages and flirty photos, but as soon as you try to set something up in person, you’re hit with a wall.

""At every turn, a plethora of images and suggestive statements lure any red-blooded male. But when actual meetings or calls are mentioned, they throw up a wall. SHAM!"" – **Bill C.**

# 💸 Token Drain Scam

The site operates on a token system, where each message costs you a dollar or more. Kendall W. noticed an influx of messages from young, attractive women, which seemed too good to be true—and it was. He quickly realized that the site sends these messages to make you spend more money on tokens.

""I'm 55, overweight, and getting tons of messages from beautiful 20-year-olds. Great for your ego, but it’s a major scam."" – **Kendall W.**

# 🛑 Misleading Promises

Like Rick H., many users were drawn in by ads that promised instant fun with attractive women. However, these women would “like” your profile even before seeing it and always change the subject when asked to meet.

""You get likes before they even see you and are told how good-looking you are. When you attempt a meeting, they ask some asinine question instead. Don’t let them take your money—you get nothing for it."" – **Rick H.**

# 🧑‍💻 Fake Profiles Everywhere

And then we’ve got Scott P., who spent hundreds of dollars on the site but never managed to meet a single woman. He’s convinced the site is run by employees who pose as potential dates, simply to keep you hooked on messaging.

""The women are fake. They reach out, begging for sex, but only ask more stupid questions when you try to set something up. I’m convinced the site takes down your number if you try to share it. F\*\* this site!""\* – **Scott P.**

# 🐟 Can You Say Catfish?

James S. sums up CrushNextDoor as a site full of fake profiles, leading you on just enough to make you buy more credits.

""The site is filled with bottom-feeding catfish. They lead you on just to buy more credits. They say, 'I really don’t feel safe to email or text,' but then keep you hooked. Worst site ever!"" – **James S.**

# 🤖 Bot Overload

Some users, like John C., reported receiving phony replies from fake profiles designed to eat up your credits. The whole experience feels like you're talking to bots rather than real people.

""Buy credits, and you’ll get phony replies. No one ever wants to meet in person. Just mail after mail to eat up credits. It should be banned for international fraud."" – **John C.**

# 🤑 All About The Money

Rod D. spent over $6,000 on this site (yikes!) without managing to get even a single woman to meet him in person. The messages from the supposed women are all part of a larger scam to keep you spending.

""I spent north of $6,000 on this website. Not once did anyone agree to meet for coffee, breakfast, anything. Save your money!"" – **Rod D.**

# 🚫 Wrong Profile Details?

Wah M. had a weird glitch where the site listed him in the wrong city, and despite trying to correct it multiple times, it never changed. He also received messages from much younger women, which raised even more red flags.

""I signed up in MyCity, TX, but the profile stated I was in MyCity, IL. Every time I tried to fix it, it stayed the same. All these 20-year-old women messaging me? Yeah, right."" – **Wah M.**

# ❌ It's Just for Entertainment

Lastly, Louis J. uncovered a bombshell in the terms and conditions. The website admits that none of the women are available for real-life meetups—CrushNextDoor is purely for “entertainment” purposes.

""In the terms and conditions, it says NONE of the women are available for personal meetings. DO NOT waste your money on tokens!"" – **Louis J.**

# Overall Verdict and Recommendation

With feedback like this, it's pretty clear: CrushNextDoor seems like a scam designed to drain your wallet, not get you dates. The profiles are fake, the messages are canned, and no one ever wants to meet up.

1ibw6cm,https://www.reddit.com/r/WomenDatingOverForty/comments/1ibw6cm/am_i_redirecting/,Am I redirecting?,"Bc I don't know. Backstory is that this is a gentleman who I dumped 2 years ago after a 3 year relationship.  The love was there but he just didn't have his shit together. We remained in contact from time to time while I periodically blocked him to avoid getting sucked in while I was figuring my own shit out. (It involved AA on my end. We are all a work in progress.)

Anyhoo he is currently unblocked but I don't initiate contact or get into long conversations because I have finally embraced the joy of living life on my terms. I dated someone else for about a year and dumped that guy after he forgot my birthday. 

But this ex. I truly love him. The difference between now and before is that I finally love and respect myself. And the hard truth, which actually isn't so hard, is that for me, it's him or it's nobody.  And if it's nobody, I'm actually OK with that and I'm actively planning the next phase of my life (kids are close to grown) and planning a big adventure that does not include him. It's my life and I only get one and I'm going to have my adventure no matter what.  (In brief, after the youngest leaves I'm going to rent out my enormous albatross of a house for a few years and go digital nomad until the grandkids start arriving, and at that point I'll return home. I raised 5 kids and I want this adventure for ME.)

So he's coming around with increasing frequency.  Word on the street, so to say, is that he too has gotten it together.  Not a different person but the things that I didn't like are in the past, from what I hear.

However. He made a stupid and outrageous ask that I quickly shot down.  I didn't explain, I just said no and went about my business.  A few days later I got the coffee invite.  That's not crazy given that we know each other well. But I said no, coffee isn't a date. No further explanation.  Went about my business. 

Next request was something along the lines of when he gets back (he's out of town on a work trip and that I AM freaked out about bc it's in the city where his cousin lives and he doesn't know that early after our breakup I dated the cousin and marriage was discussed and wow was that a bad decision for so many reasons and also obviously that's not going to go over well--I blocked Cousin a while back but ugh, I hate the me who used to drink and make dumb decisions) we should get together. 

So here is where I wonder if I redirected and educated too much. His ask was as soon as he gets back, which is tomorrow.  My response was no, I'm busy. (I'm not busy with anything other than living my life.) Andthen I said I AM free this weekend, so feel free to ask me out on a real date for a specific day and time. And left it at that. 

His response was to ask me out on a real date for Saturday night at a time specific.  

Did I over educate this man?

Additional background.  We are both members of the same religion, which is a marriage-oriented one. I have not mentioned to him that I have no intention of becoming his girlfriend again.  He's sampled the goods. I won't be auditioning. 

It's just dinner, right? He will not be entering my house  nor will he be entering my bed. (I would love for him to enter my bed bc this is one TALENTED and generous man in that department.  But I choose me and my emotional health and peace even if it means that I end up dating BOB, ha ha.) And despite the religious part of it, I don't want to talk about that stuff with him anytime soon because I am anti-taking back the ex in general and it's not something I would even consider unless and until I am good and convinced that the work he has done on himself has resulted in a change for the better.

One good thing I can say about our past relationship is that despite his faults, in many ways he treated me in a way that set the bar high for my subsequent gentlemen callers (not meaning sex, meaning things like opening doors for me, doing things for me, remembering things that were important to me and not arguing or doing them begrudgingly) did not do and were not interested in doing, both little things and bigger things. And that planted the seed of demanding more from men and choosing to cut off people who didn't treat me like I want to be treated. 

Did I do too much work by saying I would only entertain a real date? 

Thank you for reading my novel. And now I'm going to spend the day working at a job I love and taking breaks to do the things I love (weight lifting and dance practice) and not thinking about this bc there is so much more to life than him.",3,1738048702.0,WomenDatingOverForty,15,1.0,False

His weight is not what its supposed to be because he vomits all he eats, most of the time. He also has cmpa and I m dairy free for a long time but his reflux never got any better. Well sometimes it got better, I had no idea if its related to anything I eat because I m eating same things almost everytime. No eggs, soy, nuts, beef. I have a cup of coffee everyday, oats from time to time and I ve read here that sometimes oats may trigger vomiting in babies so I also tried cutting oats but no big changes.

He refuses formula so it does not seem an option for us now.

If he nurses longer than 15 minutes, he vomits. If I try to burp him he vomits. He sometimes vomits even an hour after nursing. 
We have been prescribed motilium but it gave him terrible stomach pain. His ped suggested maybe giving him half a dose so I m going to try that. We are also using a medicine similar to gaviscon infant.

Please tell me that it may have nothing to do with what I eat, but it is just reflux. Because this guilt is driving me insane, I feel like I m not doing him any good but just giving him pain.

**Adding a starter to a slow-burn play I sort of have in mind. Read it and let me know how you see it continuing forward, I’d love to hear your thoughts and ideas**
————
As the warmth of the coffee cup seeped into my hands, I found myself lost in thought. I had spent the entire afternoon shopping for Navratri, trying to distract myself from the nagging feeling that had settled deep in my chest. The excitement of the upcoming festival should’ve filled me with joy, but instead, I was caught in a quiet reflection.

My marriage, once vibrant and full of love, had begun to feel mundane. The spark that once defined our relationship seemed to have faded into routine. My husband, who once filled my days with laughter, now seemed consumed by his work. I couldn’t deny the comfort of the life he had provided financial security, a beautiful home, everything I could ask for. But something was missing. A craving I couldn’t push aside. The intimacy, the passion the very essence of what makes a marriage exciting, was absent!

I sighed, taking another sip of my coffee, willing myself to push away these thoughts. But before I could dwell too long, the door of the cafe chimed, and in walked someone who instantly lifted the heavy cloud over me.

My **Father-in-Law**

He was someone I had always shared a comfortable, flirtatious bond with. Tall, confident, and effortlessly charming, he had a way of commanding attention without even trying. His presence instantly lit up the room, and I couldn’t help but compare him to my husband more often than I’d like to admit. He was everything my husband wasn’t..spontaneous, attentive, and, well, thrilling in ways my marriage hadn’t been for a long time.",2,1738047585.0,BollyGlamandRP,1,1.0,False

Today, I’m finally ready to share the devastating sequence of events that shattered my life: hardly a month after our engagement, my fiancée Jessica’s family was involved in a horrific accident.

>She was forced to run between hospital rooms alone—until they all passed away. Consumed by grief, and waiting desperately for me to show up, Jessica ultimately took her own life. 

>Because I wasn’t there—because I failed her—she felt abandoned and did the unthinkable. All of this could have been prevented if the visa process hadn’t crumbled under *VFS’s* colossal screw-up. It still haunts me every single day to think that something so straightforward turned into a fatal barrier.

# From a Cafeteria “Hi” to Forever: Our Long-Distance Love Story

Jessica and I had been together for eight incredible years—years that changed me in ways I still can’t fully explain. We first met in grad school; she was the warm, radiant soul who sat across me in the cafeteria and said **“hi”** with a smile that nearly made me drop my plate.

I was a fairly shy guy who thought I could only admire someone like her from a distance. But there she was, carrying her tray, fearless in that small act of kindness that made me feel seen. Our early days were a blur of late-night coffee runs and laughing over inside jokes nobody else understood. She’d tease me for my obsession with dosas that I made every day, and I’d grin every time she tried to convince me that I was missing out by not eating steak. She was the runner—I was the kind of person who’d huff and puff after five minutes on the treadmill. But she nudged me into signing up for a 5K, then a 10K, until suddenly we were crossing marathon finish lines with sweat in our eyes and joy in our hearts.

Time flew, and somehow we made long distance look almost easy. When Covid hit, we dealt with absurd time zone differences and digital calendar dates. We’d fall asleep on video calls, waking up to each other’s sleepy faces. We planned our entire future like kids mapping out a treasure hunt—dreaming of running marathons in exotic places, traveling to meet halfway whenever we had a free weekend, and celebrating both Diwali and Christmas together.

Then one day in 2021, just when Covid cases seemed to be ebbing, we were on one of those video calls. This time, her backdrop was a sun-kissed Portuguese beach. She was a little more dressed than usual; I knew something was up. And all of a sudden, in the middle of our usual conversation, she went down on a knee and asked me out:

>**“Mr. Ameya, my Indian boyfriend, we’ve spent way too much time away from each other and I can’t let another Covid outbreak come and make me wait longer. I want you to marry me NOW!”**

I burst out in tears. I’d gone eight months without physically seeing her and while I was supposed to be asking her out, she did it. I wanted to take the plunge, and though my family always had a hint, I had serious conversations with them and got them on board—Their only son was getting engaged to a white woman. It was all new, but my large clan of 300 relatives were excited.

While Jessica had only 3 people in her family, we decided they’d fly down to India for our engagement later that year. It was an occasion where families could interact with each other, get acquainted with different cultures before we got married later that year.



# The Engagement and the Chaos That Followed

Jessica and her family—her parents and younger brother—arrived in India for our engagement. Even though I was running around managing last-minute details, we squeezed in a quick getaway to Goa. Her great-grandfather had once spent time in the Portuguese-influenced areas there, so it felt special for her family to walk the same roads he once did.

The engagement itself was a blur of color and laughter. Jessica chose to wear a traditional saree, and her parents and brother dove right into our customs, asking questions, trying the food, and smiling through every greeting and ritual. Those eight days turned into some of the happiest moments Jessica and I had shared yet—both our worlds merging in a way we’d only ever imagined.

But as soon as they boarded the plane back home, something in my heart felt off. I remember tossing and turning at 2 AM that morning, telling myself it was just the sadness of their departure. Jessica texted to say they’d landed safely in Lisbon, though they still had a five-hour drive ahead to reach their hometown. My eyes were heavy as I typed back, **“I love you,”** before I finally drifted off.

A couple of hours later, at 4:30 AM, my phone buzzed. It was Jessica calling. We’d made a rule: if it wasn’t urgent, she would never call twice in the middle of the night. Yet there it was—a second call. My heart lurched. I grabbed the phone.

There was no **“hello,”** just chaos and her sobbing.

>**“My dad passed away,”** she cried. **“He’s gone. Pai is no more... Papa is no more. How is this fair? I can’t believe this is happening... Why is this happening?”**

Her voice was so broken, I could barely process her words. My mind went blank; I couldn’t figure out if I was dreaming. I tried to get her to calm down, to understand what she was saying, but she just kept sobbing.

>**“Everyone’s in the ICU,”** Jessica screamed. **“I have nobody! I’m so scared... even you don’t care, you’re so far away. Why did nothing happen to me? Why am I the one left?”**

>**“Jessica, Jessica,”** I begged, **“just tell me what happened.”**

She couldn’t form a coherent sentence. Between gasps and tears, she sounded completely lost. My own head was spinning. One moment, we were celebrating our engagement; the next, she was screaming about ambulances and her father being gone. I wanted to reach through the phone and hold her, but all I could do was listen to her heartbreak crackle through that tiny speaker.

>**“I’m alone, I’m alone,”** she kept repeating. **“Please... I don’t know what to do.”**

I asked her to pass the phone to her brother, but she shrieked again—louder, more agonized than before—as if even that was impossible. That was when I realized how truly helpless I was. It felt like my entire world had split in two. The father who had just joyfully danced at our engagement was... gone?

My chest tightened with fear and disbelief. The static from her end made it worse, every broken word fueling the panic. I just wanted to be there, to hold Jessica while she fell apart. Instead, I was oceans away, clutching my phone in the early morning darkness.

That night, or morning—time was a blur—my entire future flipped upside down. In an instant, our engagement high had crashed into this spiraling nightmare. And I could only sit there, hearing the person I loved most in this world unravel, unable to do anything but whisper, **“I’m here, I’m here,”** even if I felt a million miles away.



# The VFS Nightmare Starts

Leaving Jessica alone felt unbearable, but I had no choice. Her father was gone, and her brother and mother lay in a hospital bed, clinging to life. I needed to be in Portugal, and I was ready to do whatever it took.

Later on the same day, I checked for visa slots. The earliest appointment? Three months away. Three months—while my fiancée’s entire world was collapsing. My barrage of emails and desperate phone calls to VFS and the consulate led nowhere—just endless automated replies and hold music. In a final bid, I called everyone I knew, begging for help. Finally, a friend connected me to a travel agent who claimed that he could get an appointment in five days. It sounded suspicious and I thought I was probably getting scammed, but I was desperate, so I paid him Rs. 20,000 to get me this appointment. Lo and behold, I got a slot five days later in Mumbai.

While I prepared to fly out, Jessica told me her brother was deteriorating and her mother was barely improving. The stress was crushing her. I urged her to hold on; I was on my way.

Five long days later, I finally arrived in Mumbai, hoping this ordeal would be over soon.

As I made my way to the *VFS* center that morning, Jessica called. The doctors had warned her to **“prepare”** for the worst regarding her brother. It felt like every passing minute was a lifetime. Yet when I got to *VFS*, a staff member insisted that there was a “very long wait. He suggested I pay extra for the “Premium Lounge,” which, he promised, would be more efficient, more comfortable, and save me 4-5 hours of waiting. Every second away from Jessica was excruciating. In my desperation, I swallowed my suspicion and paid. I got to the **“premium lounge”** and it was all chaos. On my way to the premium lounge, I peaked into the regular ‘room’ and it was practically empty. I had been scammed. They promised shorter wait times and faster processing, but I sat waiting over an hour just to reach the document submission desk.

When I finally did, the staff member looked like he’d stepped out of college the previous week. He seemed untrained. He barely glanced at my paperwork and declared them ‘complete’. My case was complex—I’m a freelancer and also own a GST-registered business—so I asked him to double-check, holding back on my growing frustration. All he did was blindly read the document checklist. I’d seen the official checklist online, but it wasn’t detailed enough for my unique circumstances, leaving me uncertain about precisely which documents I needed. I still wasn’t convinced, so I pushed again. The guy asked another staff member sitting next to him, but it was pointless. He was just as clueless and referred to the checklist. It was infuriating—blank faces all around, like they had no idea what to do.

Before I lost control completely and did something I would regret, I asked him to call his manager and check with him. The manager understood my query and looked at my documents and told me I was missing a critical document. Had I not insisted on a thorough check, they would have accepted my incomplete file and sent me down a path that almost certainly would’ve led to a rejection. He told me that if I wasn’t able to get the documents in a couple of hours, I’d have to book a new appointment and come again. My heart pounded. I couldn’t bear the thought of Jessica alone, spiraling further into despair.

The next two hours were a blur. I called my accountant, who thankfully was able to email me the missing document within half an hour. To have my documents printed, I had to first scramble to get access to a laptop with an internet connection which was connected to the printer in the center. After talking to a couple of employees, I was finally directed to this laptop. I logged in and sent the document for printing. I was again directed to another queue of frustrated applicants to collect the print outs. I was losing my mind. Every second felt excruciating, as if time itself was mocking me. Jessica was alone, terrified, and I was stuck hare, in this visa application center. 

I went back to the desk, only to be sent to the back of the queue again. More waiting. When they finally got to me, they accepted my documents.  When I finally got my newly printed documents re-verified, the staff member took them without a hint of apology or empathy. I explained the depth of my emergency to him, pleading with him to expedite my application. He shrugged, his hands tied. “You will get your decision in 14 working days. We can’t do anything; you have to email the embassy,” he said, as though I hadn’t already been doing that for weeks. My documents were finally submitted.  I thought I could now leave —but, of course, it didn’t end there. I was sent to the payment counter. Couldn’t I have just paid at the verification desk? With my patience on thin ice, I waited again. At the payment counter, I was greeted with yet another long line. In that line, people were whispering curses about how slow everything was. It felt like we were living in a bygone era—a labyrinth designed to waste people’s time and money. Everywhere I looked, I saw ways in which basic technology could have saved us from these endless lines. To make things worse, they didn’t accept cash. If I hadn’t carried my debit card, I would’ve been forced to get another appointment. To my absolute horror, I discovered that the process still wasn’t done—I was to wait in line yet again for biometrics. I couldn’t believe it. I’d spent 5 whole hours at the centre, in spite of paying for the “premium lounge” service. Five agonizing hours of incompetence, disorganization, and dread.

I left the center feeling a cold emptiness in my chest. Jessica’s brother was on the brink, her mother barely holding on, and I still had no guarantee I’d be at her side in time but hopeful that I would get my visa within 14 days. 

# Things Get Worse – Jessica’s Brother Passes, Mom Goes into a Coma, and VFS Screws Up Again

Later that night Jessica called. Her brother had just passed. She didn’t cry while telling me this, almost as if she had accepted her fate.

>**“Last week, I was the only one at Papa’s funeral. Now I’ve got to do the same for my brother. Organising funerals has become a regular chore for me.”**

Over the next few days, Jessica showed very little emotion and went on with her chores: waking up, checking on her mom in the hospital, asking doctors for updates, and just existing. I started a new round of emails and calls—one every day to VFS, one every day to the embassy—explaining the urgency. She had almost given up and it scared me. I kept in constant touch with her. Doctors had put her mother into a medically induced coma, and things didn’t improve.

Fourteen days had passed, and still, nothing. My mental health was steadily declining but I held myself together for Jessica.  Jessica had been acting strange and had mentioned **“No point in living”** a few times. Jessica’s mother was still in a coma, and Jessica had buried her brother and father all alone. Conversations with her were plain—she was neither crying nor showing interest in anything.

On the 15th day, I couldn’t take it any longer. I needed my visa at any cost. In hopes of forcing someone to give me answers, I boarded the overnight bus to Mumbai in hopes of forcing someone to see me. Security guards at the VFS center barred me from entering without an appointment. Completely overcome by panic, grief and desperation, and nowhere to go, I took the next available flight to Goa from Mumbai, to visit the Consulate. But once again, I was turned away at the gates. The bureaucratic machine had me pinned to the ground, helpless.

I returned home feeling completely defeated. I sank into my couch, numb with grief and helplessness. Very late that night, around 4am, I heard my phone ring, it was Jessica. Her mother had passed. Her voice trembling, she told me:

>**“She’s gone too… She’s gone too…”**

She was absolutely devastated. All I could hear was my own guilt reverberating through my chest. She was alone, crumbling under the weight of multiple funerals. I will never forget the sound of her voice. I promised her I’d be there soon. I promised her I’d fix it but I didn’t know how, because I still didn’t have my visa. 

And then, the next day, I finally received a message: my visa had been processed. My passport was supposedly on its way back from the VFS centre, and would be delivered in two days.

I immediately booked a flight for three days later. I told Jessica the good news that night. While the vibrant, headstrong, peppy girl I knew from college was completely gone, I sensed a glimmer of hope in her voice for the first time weeks.

2 days went by, but there was no sign of my passport. Once again, I began panicking. I called the VFS helpline repeatedly but got nowhere. Finally, on the third day—my flight day—I travelled to Mumbai once more. I went straight to VFS.  I rushed up to a manager and demanded to know where my passport was, practically shoving my phone in his face to show him the message that claimed it had already been dispatched. The manager mumbled in confusion about how it generally arrives in two days, sounding like he thought I was at fault for not having it. He questioned whether I’d provided the correct address, if I was absolutely sure it hadn’t arrived at my home, and suggested I call Blue Dart. He went on to explain that because Blue Dart was just a third-party delivery provider, VFS had no direct way to track or control the shipments—implying the blame might lie entirely elsewhere. I explained—yet again—that everything was in order and that I had received no delivery.

After a series of half-baked excuses, he stood there, totally clueless about what to do next. I watched as he called two or three people on the phone, but didn’t get any answers. Finally, he said he needed to head to the back office to check the system. By then, an hour had already passed as I waited in a state of raw anxiety. Ten minutes later, he returned with the same bewildered expression on his face. “It seems you got the message by mistake,” he informed me flatly, adding that my passport was still at the embassy and wouldn’t arrive before my flight later that evening. I felt hollowed out by frustration and disbelief, all my hopes of catching that flight evaporating with those words. My head spun with anger. I was left with no choice but to cancel my flight. Jessica was inconsolable that day when I broke the news to her. Her quiet sobs broke through the silence, each one heavy with the weight of everything that had gone wrong. It shattered me completely, knowing she was breaking alone, while I was powerless to hold her when she needed me the most.

Later that evening as I prepared to return home to Nagpur, my parents informed me that a courier had arrived at home with a passport. I was flooded with relief, I asked them to open the package immediately. They told me that the passport inside wasn’t mine. The label on the envelope had my name, but the passport bore a stranger’s photo and details. My heart dropped. I stood there, stunned and infuriated. *VFS* had f\*cked my life up again. A mistake of this magnitude felt almost incomprehensible. And the manager in the morning had fucking lied to me. Desperate for answers, I raced back to the VFS center, only to find the doors locked for the day.

The next morning, I arrived at the VFS center the moment they opened, my blood boiling with fury. I stormed inside, found the same manager who had lied to me the day before, and practically erupted in front of him. “How could you lie to my face?” I shouted, voice trembling with anger. “Did you even check the system, or were you just trying to get rid of me?” The manager looked utterly dumbfounded—like he’d been bitten by a snake—incapable of offering a single coherent reply. “I need the phone number of the person whose passport I have,” I said. The manager, still at a loss, stammered about privacy rules and said he couldn’t share another customer’s information. 

That was my last straw. I told him I wasn’t leaving until I got that number. I was in tears, crying in front of this manager. The manager muttered something and started making a few calls. It was déjà vu: more frantic phone calls, more emailing superiors for “approvals,” more shrugs of confusion. Finally, after an hour, he handed me a scrap of paper with a phone number.

I called it right away, my heart hammering in my chest. He sounded equally panicked about the situation. I confirmed if he had my passport, and he did. But in an odd twist of kindness, he agreed to come to Mumbai in person to exchange our passports and avoid any more courier nightmares. 

At last, we had a plan—some clarity. My fiancée Jessica would be so relieved, I thought. I sent her messages, urging her to hold on just a little longer, promising that we would fix this. But she didn’t respond. I called her multiple times and yet no response. As hours slipped by without a response, something cold and heavy lodged itself in my chest. After twelve hours, dread became a living thing. I didn’t sleep that night, my phone clutched in my hand until dawn, waiting for a call or a text—anything.

At dawn, no calls, no messages. I was physically shaking, overcome by a sickening worry. 

Eventually, the next morning, my phone did ring. I snatched it up, expecting Jessica’s voice, but the words were delivered in broken English by someone who identified themselves as the Portuguese police. Their voice was solemn, the words nearly lost in the haze of disbelief that instantly clouded my mind. They had found Jessica’s body. She had taken her own life.

The entire world seemed to dissolve around me. I sank to the floor, unable to draw breath, as the horrors of the past weeks surged through me in one overwhelming wave. In that moment, any sense of self I had left vanished into a raw, gaping void. The utter irresponsibility, the lost paperwork, the endless waiting—everything reeled through my memory like a grim montage leading to this final, irreversible horror.

In one merciless instant, I lost the woman I’d promised to spend my life with. The system that should have been designed to help me travel had instead hindered me at every turn, devouring time we didn’t have. I have replayed these events in my mind a thousand times since then, searching for what might have been if the process had been smoother—if *VFS* or anyone in authority had shown the slightest bit of diligence. If I had been able to stand beside Jessica even a day sooner, would she still be alive?

Every sleepless night leads me back to the same devastating conclusion: she needed me, and I was locked in an endless tangle of red tape and incompetence. Her death became collateral damage to a system that refused to do its job.

I write all this now, after years of battling the crushing guilt and the black hole of grief. No one can undo what happened, and I will never be the same. I am a nobody—one insignificant person against a colossal machine fueled by wealth and monopolistic power. But I can at least tell this story. Jessica deserves that. Others who have suffered through similar nightmares deserve that. If my words can push even a small change—if someone, somewhere, reads them and decides to demand better—then perhaps I will have honored Jessica’s memory.

Mine is just one voice, but it carries the echoes of a love story cut short by colossal ineptitude. I wish I could tell you that time has healed me, that I’ve found a measure of peace, but every day, I wake with the memory of her final, trembling words echoing in my mind. Until then, I live with this burden, a grief so deep it may never leave me. And I hold one final, desperate hope: that no one else loses the love of their life because of a system that is supposed to help but instead leads them to heartbreak, isolation, and despair.



# Aftermath, Anger, and the Will to Fight

The weeks after Jessica’s death played out in a haze. My tears ran dry, replaced by a hollow ache that wouldn’t go away. Her voice haunted every silent moment. Even in the depths of my guilt, a furious resolve began to smolder. I thought of all the other people who might be trapped in the same loop of incompetence and corruption—people for whom each day could be the difference between hope and heartbreak.

No one at VFS had done their job properly. Their laziness and corruption were clear in how they handled my case—they didn’t even meet the bare minimum standards. They lost my passport, their staff was untrained, their tech systems didn’t work, lied about their so-called “premium services,” and left me to fend for myself. If they treated me like this, was it the same for everyone else? I soon learned I wasn’t alone. Horror stories of lost applications, endless delays, and mishandled cases were everywhere. Different in detail, but the same in essence: human lives derailed by a faceless juggernaut that couldn’t care less.

I still replay each moment, asking myself—Could I have done more? Called more? Paid more? But it’s too late for regret. Jessica is gone, and with her, the future we imagined. What I have left is my rage and my story.

The pain is immense, and there are days it swallows me whole. But each time I break down, I remember Jessica’s face, bright and hopeful from better times. That memory is my spark. I no longer care if I’m **“just one person”** against a massive institution. I refuse to be silent. I refuse to let Jessica’s death be a statistic on a ledger. Her story needs to be told—over and over—until those gleaming *VFS* offices realize they’re playing with real lives.

I can’t bring Jessica back, but I can use my voice. I can shout from the rooftops that this must never happen again. Every form, every queue, every **“system error”** is more than a chore—it’s a line between life and death for someone. Even if my outrage moves the dial an inch, it will honor the love I lost. It will keep Jessica’s spirit alive in the fight to make sure no one else becomes collateral damage in this monstrous system. Her story—**our** story—will be the spark that lights that flame.

Join the subreddit r/VisaVictimX and follow me on Twitter and Instagram u/VisaVictimX—this isn’t just a fight, it’s a war. Share your stories, DM me your nightmares with VFS, and tag r/VisaVictimX. Let’s tear down this vile, profit-driven machine that has ruined lives without a second thought.

They robbed me of everything—my fiancée, my future, my will to live—and I will NOT stop until VFS is held accountable for the blood they have on their hands. This is personal, and I won’t rest until every story is heard, until they are exposed for the corrupt system they are.

How do I get a lot of them to wash their hands after they use the toilet?,"This has been an ongoing issue for over a year now. I’ve had some men come to me and complain that a lot of the men are not washing their hands after using the toilet. We work with machinery and tools so a lot of the time gloves and/or barrier cream are used anyway but it’s the handles in between, when they go in the break room straight after they are touching the kettle, the microwave, the coffee machine, the food and drink that is there for them. I’ve even had one man come to me and show me literal shit on the inside door handle of the men’s toilet where someone had it on their hands and didn’t wash afterwards. 

After this I installed toilet doors that can be opened automatically by pressing a button on the bottom of the wall with a tap of your foot and signs and even a fucking message from a speaker that plays every two minutes reminding people to wash their hands. I then got someone to come in and do a talk on the importance of washing your hands before using the toilet when working with machinery and oils and after using the toilet to stop the spread of germs. 

Yesterday I again had another complaint about someone not washing their hands and when I got him in to the office and said this is the third time I’ve had separate people complaining about him he said he just doesn’t want to do it. He works in the packing and distribution where gloves are optional.

1ibvq0b,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1ibvq0b/not_all_adhdpeople_get_sleepy_from_coffee/,Not all adhd-people get sleepy from coffee,"There is still a myth that flourishes that *most* people with adhd become tired from drinking coffee, and that being tired/sleepy from caffeine is a sure sign of adhd. This leaves the people who are sensitive to caffeine (me included) a bit confused.
So I did some research.

First of all there is very little we know about the effects of caffeine on the brain. What they do know, is that caffeine is very differently metabolized in different people. In fact, there is a gene which largely dictates how fast you break down caffeine. This one is called CYP1A2. Depending on which variant of this gene you have, you can be a fast, slow or ultraslow metabolizer. Fast meaning caffeine breaks down quickly in your body, where you might not even feel the effects before it’s gone. I believe the fast variant was the most common one. Ultraslow, meaning the caffeine takes very long time to break down, to the point the lingering in the body might actually cause side effects and even damage organs, as well as give a higher risk for caffeine induced heart attack etc!
In fact, they have found that the half life of coffee in the body is 2-8 hours (!) ie its breakdown largely varies.

Caffeine does have an affect on dopamine and noradrenaline, which are believed to be too low by default in adhd. This means that coffee might affect people with adhd differently compared to people without adhd.

However, we still also have the metabolizing variants. This means that we will have about six variants in total. Even in the neurotypical group, there will be those that barely feel the effects of caffeine, and those that are extremely sensitive. And then in the adhd group, there are also different groups.
This gives us a very complex landscape with several different combinations, most of which are not researched.

So in summary, caffeine might affect the brain in a similiar way as a stimulant (increasing dopamine and noradrenaline), but its break down pattern is completely differently compared to stimulants, importantly, its action is much more ’unpredictable’, compared to controlled drug use such as Vyvanse etc.

His weight is not what its supposed to be because he vomits all he eats, most of the time. He also has cmpa and I m dairy free for a long time but his reflux never got any better. Well sometimes it got better, I had no idea if its related to anything I eat because I m eating same things almost everytime. No eggs, soy, nuts, beef. I have a cup of coffee everyday, oats from time to time and I ve read here that sometimes oats may trigger vomiting in babies so I also tried cutting oats but no big changes.

He refuses formula so it does not seem an option for us now.

If he nurses longer than 15 minutes, he vomits. If I try to burp him he vomits. He sometimes vomits even an hour after nursing. 
We have been prescribed motilium but it gave him terrible stomach pain. His ped suggested maybe giving him half a dose so I m going to try that. We are also using a medicine similar to gaviscon infant.

Please tell me that it may have nothing to do with what I eat, but it is just reflux. Because this guilt is driving me insane, I feel like I m not doing him any good but just giving him pain.

But don't worry, fellow students; here are some tips to stay ready and avoid the panic:

1. **Review Notes Regularly:** Spend 10-15 minutes each day skimming your class notes. Even a little bit of consistency can help you recall key details.
2. **Prioritize Active Participation:** Pay attention in class (even when it's tough). Professors love dropping hints about potential quiz topics.
3. **Make Flashcards:** They're great for key terms, formulas, or concepts you know might come up. Bonus: you can sneak in quick study sessions while waiting for your coffee.
4. **Buddy Up:** Form a study group and quiz each other on the material. You'd be surprised how much you can learn from your peers.
5. **Stay organized:** Keep track of chapters or sections already covered - quizzes are likely to pull from recent topics.

He noticed people walking hurriedly toward their seats. Then he saw a lady pointing toward him. “That’s my seat,” she said.

He opened his phone and checked his boarding pass; it said 9B. He got up and let her in. Then, he settled into seat 9B. He sneaked a glance at the lady. She must have been in her 30s and was wearing a nice perfume. Her bag, an LV tote, rested on her lap. She seemed busy on her phone.

Suddenly, her phone rang. “Yes, no problem. Good you managed the seat, at least. Business class is a waste of money, see you.”

He was still fiddling with his phone. He tried to squeeze further into his seat making sure his hand didn’t accidentally touch hers. Her expensive smelling perfume, a light citrus note, made him even more nervous.

Then his phone vibrated. It was his mother calling. He hesitated, unsure if he should answer, he looked away. His phone was on silent.

The lady tapped him on the shoulder and pointed to his phone. “Your phone is ringing,” she said.

“Oh yes, I didn’t notice. Thanks,” he replied and picked up the call. He began speaking in Hindi:

“Yes, I’m on the flight.”
“I can’t say.”
“Yes, yes, I had breakfast.”
“If they don’t agree—”

“Ms. Singhal, Ms. Singhal, your meal is pre-booked. What would you like to have?”

He realized he had dozed off, and the plane was now in the air. The air hostess was serving meals.

“Just give me black coffee, please. I don’t want to eat anything,” the lady replied.

“Mr. Verma, would you like to buy anything?” the air hostess asked. His organisation was cutting cost and had discontinued booking corporate meals. 

“No, just give me some water,” he said.

On Sunday I didn't get a very good night's sleep because I napped the night before. I ended up staying awake all night and tried to keep myself awake that morning by drinking coffee so I that I could catch up on Arcane. At 11am I started to feel sick and my anxiety spiked making me lie in bed paying attention to details in my body like aches and pains and weakness. I didn't know if these were withdrawal symptoms or if I was sick or if it was just my period but my OCD always tries to convince me I'm dying. 

I had a better sleep that evening but I also stayed up a bit later to finish all of Arcane because as stupid as it sounds I really needed to know what happened. I do think that sitting through all of it was far more emotionally taxing than I expected and afterwards I kind of spiraled because thematically it fits with a lot of real world issues and life after death which I ruminate on. It's such a great show but maybe some of it was too triggering to watch when I didn't have my meds to help and when I have a lot of hormones right now. On top of that last week I lost my wallet so had to cancel my cards, the news is making me angry and upset and I have a lot of study work to do. 

I'm struggling with this insomnia, I had a nightmare or what felt like one, I'm scared of dying or having a psychotic breakdown, I feel like I can't distract myself from images from the show or try and focus on anything else, which means I won't look where I'm going. I cried so hard tonight I was hyperventilating. Thankfully I live with family.

The store ends up looking like this every snowy night and it continues to get tracked in for at least a week after the storm. The ice melt has turned into dust that covers every product, even on the top shelves. You can see it in the air when we pull pallets out at night or sweep, and it gets all over our clothing. Everything we touch has salt dust on it. At the end of the night someone mops and uses the Zamboni, but it barely makes a dent. It seems like it's pretty dangerous to be in constant contact with and inhaling ice melt for 40 hours a week.

Many crew members are reporting coughing, itchy eyes, nausea, sore throats, thinning fingernails, itchy hands, etc. Some of us wear masks and gloves but not everyone. I've tried bringing it up to the mate in charge of the safety team and they echoed what our captain has been saying: ""that there's nothing they can do about it and by the time they could have a huddle with everyone the season would be over."" Our captain has even said that they don't think it's dangerous despite our complaints. It seems important to investigate the problem and educate the crew about the chemicals that we're touching and breathing all day.

People think that we should be using the Zamboni several times a day when it get's bad like this but it always gets put off until the end of the night, after we've already been sitting/laying in the salt restocking.

Whether you’re looking to restore damaged teeth, straighten misaligned ones, or enhance the overall appearance of your smile, modern oral care has a solution for you. Advanced treatments offered by a skilled Dentist Leigh or Cosmetic dentist Leigh can transform your smile, improve your oral health, and give you the confidence to shine.

In this blog, we’ll explore the latest dental treatments, including dental crowns Leigh, and how they can help you achieve the smile you’ve always wanted.

# The Importance of Prioritizing Oral Care

A healthy smile is the foundation of overall well-being. Poor oral hygiene can lead to serious health issues such as gum disease, tooth loss, and even systemic conditions like heart disease. Regular visits to a [**Dentist Leigh**](https://www.greenlanedentalpractice.co.uk/) ensure your oral health is monitored and maintained, preventing complications before they arise.

Beyond health, enhancing the appearance of your smile can have a significant impact on your self-esteem. A [**Cosmetic dentist Leigh**](https://www.greenlanedentalpractice.co.uk/treatment/smile-makeovers/) specializes in treatments designed to improve the look and feel of your teeth, offering both functional and aesthetic benefits.

# Essential Dental Treatments for a Stunning Smile

Let’s take a closer look at some of the most effective treatments available to transform your smile:

# 1. Dental Crowns for Complete Restoration

If you have a damaged, cracked, or severely decayed tooth, [**Dental Crowns Leigh**](https://www.greenlanedentalpractice.co.uk/treatment/repair/crowns/) provide a versatile solution. These caps cover the entire visible portion of your tooth, restoring its strength, shape, and appearance.

Key benefits of crowns include:

* Strengthening weakened or damaged teeth.
* Protecting teeth after procedures like root canals.
* Enhancing the appearance of discolored or misshapen teeth.

When placed by an experienced Dentist Leigh, dental crowns Leigh can last for many years, blending seamlessly with your natural teeth for a flawless look.

# 2. Clear Braces for Comfortable Straightening

Gone are the days when straightening teeth meant wearing metal braces. Clear aligners are a modern, discreet option that straightens teeth effectively without compromising your appearance during treatment.

Benefits of clear braces include:

* Transparency, making them virtually invisible.
* The ability to remove them for eating and cleaning.
* Shorter treatment times compared to traditional braces.

A Cosmetic dentist Leigh can guide you through the process of straightening your teeth with clear aligners, helping you achieve a straighter, more confident smile.

# 3. Professional Teeth Whitening

One of the quickest ways to enhance your smile is through professional whitening treatments. Over time, factors like coffee, tea, and smoking can cause staining and discoloration. Professional whitening, supervised by a Cosmetic dentist Leigh, offers a brighter, more radiant smile in just one session.

Unlike over-the-counter products, professional whitening treatments are tailored to your specific needs and deliver long-lasting results safely and effectively.

# 4. Veneers for a Picture-Perfect Smile

For those seeking a complete transformation, veneers are an excellent choice. These thin shells are bonded to the front of your teeth, correcting imperfections such as gaps, chips, and discoloration.

Why choose veneers?

* They provide instant, dramatic results.
* They are durable and long-lasting with proper care.
* They offer a natural, flawless appearance.

By consulting a Cosmetic dentist Leigh, you can achieve a smile that looks as natural as it is stunning.

# The Psychological Benefits of a Great Smile

Yesterday, President Donald Trump began a trade war with Colombia after that country’s president refused to permit two U.S. military airplanes full of deportees to land in Colombia. As Regina Garcia Cano and Astrid Suárez of the Associated Press pointed out, Colombia and the U.S. had an existing agreement for deportations under former president Joe Biden, and it accepted 475 deportation flights from 2020 to 2024, accepting 124 flights in 2024 alone. But the Biden administration used commercial and charter flights, while as national security analyst Juliette Kayyem noted, Trump used a military plane that arrived unannounced. 

As Tim Naftali of Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs explained: “If a foreign country tries to land its military planes—except in an emergency—without an existing agreement that is an infringement of sovereignty.” Colombia rejected the military planes without prior authorization and offered the use of its presidential plane instead. 

Colombia also asked the U.S. to provide notice and decent treatment for its people, an issue that had been raised and resolved in 2023 after migrants arrived in hand and foot cuffs. Colombian president Gustavo Petro noted that the U.S. had committed that it would guarantee dignified conditions for the repatriation of migrants. The plane of migrants landed in Honduras, where Colombia sent its presidential plane to pick them up.

Trump announced that Colombia’s “denial of these flights has jeopardized the National Security and Public Safety of the United States,” and slapped a 25% tariff on products from Colombia, which include about $6 billion of crude petroleum, $1.8 billion of coffee, and $1.6 billion of cut flowers. In addition, he said, the U.S. would revoke the visas of all Colombian “Government Officials, and all Allies and Supporters.” He promptly deported Colombian staff members of the World Bank who were working for international diplomatic organizations in the U.S., and canceled visa appointments at Colombia’s U.S. Embassy.

Rather than backing down, President Petro threatened to levy a retaliatory tariff on U.S. products. Colombia imports 96.7% of the corn it feeds its livestock from the U.S., putting Colombia in the top five export markets for U.S. corn. According to a letter written by a bipartisan group of lawmakers eager to protect that trade, led by Senator Todd Young (R-IN), in 2003 the U.S. exported more than 4 million metric tons of corn to Colombia, which translated to $1.14 billion in sales. “American farmers cannot afford to lose such a vital export market,” the lawmakers wrote, “especially when access to the top U.S. corn export market, Mexico, is already at risk.”

By this morning the economic crisis appeared to be over, although U.S. visa restrictions apparently remain. With prior authorization and better treatment of migrants, Colombia is willing to accept the migrant flights. The White House declared victory, saying: “Today’s events make clear to the world that America is respected again. President Trump will continue to fiercely protect our nation's sovereignty, and he expects all other nations of the world to fully cooperate in accepting the deportation of their citizens illegally present in the United States.” 

The administration’s handling of the situation with Colombia reveals that their power depends on convincing people to ignore reality and instead to believe in the fantasy world Trump dictates. 

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt announced yesterday morning that “[d]eportation flights have begun.” In fact, nothing is “beginning.” In 2024, Colombia accepted on average more than two U.S. flights of migrants a week. And, as immigration scholar Austin Kocher noted, “everyone on this deportation flight was arrested and detained by the Biden administration.” 

Over the past four years, Trump and MAGA Republicans repeatedly insisted that Biden had maintained “open borders,” while in fact, what the administration did was to try to address a situation made worse by the coronavirus pandemic. 

As Katie Tobin of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace explains, before the coronavirus pandemic, Venezuela, where the economy was particularly bad under rising authoritarian Nicolás Maduro, sent migrants abroad. By June 2022, 6 million Venezuelans had fled their country; by September 2024, that number was 7.7 million. South American governments welcomed the Venezuelan migrants and others, including Haitians fleeing their country’s political chaos.

But as economies collapsed after the coronavirus crisis, Tobin explains, migrant populations that had settled in South American countries were forced out. From 2019 to 2021, Colombia’s per capita gross domestic product fell 4.6%; Peru’s, 5.3%; Ecuador’s, 2.8%; Brazil’s, 11.7%; and Venezuela’s, 20%. As the U.S. economy grew by 8.38%, Canada’s grew by 13.1%, and Mexico’s dropped only by 0.7%, migrants headed north. In September 2021, when 15,000 Haitians who had originally migrated to Brazil arrived at the U.S. border with Mexico, countries throughout the hemisphere realized that they needed a new regional approach to migration.  

After nine months of negotiations, 21 countries announced that they had created a new migration pact for the Western Hemisphere. It provided economic support for Latin American countries that were original destinations for migrants, expanded formal pathways for immigration, and increased border security across the region. 

Canada and Mexico were the first countries to buy into the new agreement. The U.S. turned next to strong ally Colombia, which agreed in March 2022, after which Vice President Kamala Harris brought on board Caribbean countries. By June 10, when the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection was announced, twenty-one nations had signed on. U.N. observers were present to demonstrate their support. 

The Biden administration insisted that countries begin immediate action, and they did. Tobin notes that Belize, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Panama, and Peru have made sweeping new offers of legal status to hundreds of thousands of migrants already living in their countries, while Colombia has offered legal status to 2 million Venezuelans and Brazil has welcomed more than 500,000. Mexico and Guatemala have offered legal pathways to workers. 

Canada, Costa Rica, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Spain, and the U.S. launched a virtual platform to enable migrants to apply for admission remotely. When Mexico agreed to accept Venezuelans who had crossed into the U.S. unlawfully and at the same time the U.S. announced a legal pathway for 24,000 Venezuelans, border crossings dropped 90% within a week. Biden and Mexican president Andrés Manuel López Obrador expanded that initiative to include Cubans, Haitians, and Nicaraguans. 

By 2023, border arrests had fallen by about half. Although Congress failed to pass a strong bipartisan measure to increase border security and fund immigration courts, arrests fell by half again after Biden in June 2024 issued a proclamation that barred migrants from being granted asylum when U.S. officials deemed the border was overwhelmed. By the end of Biden’s term, unlawful border crossings had plummeted to lows that hadn’t been seen since June 2020.  

There are new challenges to managing migration as wars, climate change, and economic pressures push migrants out of various parts of Africa and out of China. Many of those migrants are finding their way to Latin America and from there to the U.S. The U.N. Refugee Agency estimates that 117 million people were displaced by the end of 2023.

Trump won election in part by vowing to shut down immigration, and as soon as he took office he canceled the CBP One app, the virtual platform that allowed migrants to apply for asylum. During the campaign, he vowed to deport those migrants he claimed were criminals, which many interpreted to mean he would only remove those who had committed violent crimes (which the U.S. has always done). But in his first term, Trump’s people considered anyone who entered the U.S. outside of immigration law to be a criminal, and this appears to be the definition his people are using now. 

Daily deportation raids in which U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents arrested a few hundred people in sweeps began almost as soon as Trump took office. Josh Campbell, Andy Rose, and Nick Valencia of CNN reported that the federal government has flooded the media with video and photos of agents in tactical gear, their vests bearing the words “Police ICE” and “Homeland Security” as they lead individuals in handcuffs. The journalists report that this is not an accident: agents were told to have their agency names clearly displayed for the press.

The presence of television talk show host Dr. Phil (McGraw) with an ICE team in Chicago reinforces the sense that these arrests are designed for the cameras. So does yesterday’s report by Nick Miroff and Maria Sacchetti of the Washington Post that Trump is disappointed with the sweeps so far and has directed officials to ramp up arrests aggressively, providing quotas for ICE field offices. Today, new secretary of defense Pete Hegseth said the department will “shift” to “the defense of the territorial integrity of the United States of America at the southern border.” 

Yesterday’s spat with Colombia’s president enabled Trump to declare victory, but Colombia has been the top U.S. ally in Latin America, a close partner in combating drug trafficking and managing migration. That relationship, which has taken years of careful cultivation, is now threatened.

Will Freeman of the Council on Foreign Relations, a think tank specializing in U.S. foreign policy, posted: “I can’t think of many *worse* strategic blunders for the U.S., as it competes w/ China, than going nuclear against its oldest strategic ally & last big country in S. America where it enjoys a trade advantage…. Trump certainly expects that b[ecause] 1/3 of Colombian exports go to the U.S. Petro will be forced to back down. But Petro seems to welcome the fight & has already signaled wishes to deepen ties w/ China. Colombia will lose partnership on security it badly needs. Only China stands to gain from this.” 

Indeed, China’s ambassador to Colombia promptly noted that “we are at the best moment of our diplomatic relations between China and Colombia, which are now 45 years old.” 

Meanwhile, according to former ambassador Luis G. Moreno, the Trump administration has shut down 2,100 courses in the premier training facility for State Department foreign service officers, ostensibly because they are too associated with diversity, equity, and inclusion. Moreno adds: “Dismantling of a professional diplomatic corps is underway.”

Rachel: (flipping through a fashion magazine) So, I just don’t get it. How did Donald Trump become president? He doesn’t even look like a president. He looks like the guy who sends his steak back because it’s too well-done.

Phoebe: (nodding) I think it’s cool! I mean, this just proves my theory. Anybody can be president. Like… literally anybody. Even me.

Monica: (panicking) Okay, that’s terrifying. You’re the person who thought “North Korea” was a boy band.

Phoebe: (defensive) In my defense, “Kim Jong Un” does sound like the lead singer.

Chandler: (looking up from his newspaper) You guys, I think we’re missing the big picture here. Trump being president means I could be president. Imagine that—President Bing. My slogan: “Could I BE any more presidential?”

Rachel: (laughs) Oh yeah, Chandler, you’d be great. You’d appoint Joey as Secretary of Pizza and Napkins.

Joey: (walking in, overhearing) Hey, why not? I’d be awesome. First executive order: free sandwiches for everyone. And you know what? I’d outlaw salads.

Chandler: (deadpan) Wow, a bold move. You’re truly a man of the people, Joey.

Monica: (sarcastic) Yeah, until they all die of cholesterol poisoning.

[Scene Two: Monica and Rachel’s apartment. Ross is trying to educate Joey on politics while Monica cooks in the background.]

Ross: (drawing on a whiteboard) Okay, Joey, here’s how the electoral college works—

Joey: (confused) Wait. College? I thought you said this was about politics, not school.

Ross: (frustrated) It’s not that kind of college! It’s—ugh, never mind. Forget it. Let’s just say people vote, and Trump won.

Joey: (nodding) Got it. So he’s like the quarterback who scores the touchdown in the last inning.

Ross: (facepalming) I’m pretty sure that sentence just made the Founding Fathers roll over in their graves.

Monica: (to Ross) Why do you even bother explaining this to Joey? He once thought the Constitution was a menu item.

Joey: (defensive) It SOUNDS like a pasta! “I’ll have the Constitution with a side of garlic bread.” See? Makes sense.

[Scene Three: Central Perk. The gang is watching Trump’s first press conference on TV.]

TV Trump: ""We’re going to make America great again. Better than ever. And we’re going to do it by bringing back the jobs, the money, and, most importantly, the hair. People love my hair. It’s presidential hair. Tremendous hair.""

Rachel: (leaning back) I can’t believe I’m saying this, but I miss when presidents were boring. Like, where’s a guy in a suit who just says, “Taxes are bad, but schools are good”?

Phoebe: (excited) Oh, I actually think he has amazing energy. You know, kind of like me. If I were president, I’d make yoga mandatory. And I’d replace the national anthem with “Smelly Cat.”

Chandler: (mock serious) Yes, because nothing screams patriotism like a song about a smelly feline.

Joey: (thoughtful) Wait. Can you fire a president? Like, if we all vote, can we just say, “You’re fired!” and he’s gone?

Chandler: (grinning) That’s... actually not a terrible idea. Maybe that’s his plan. He’s just doing a really long episode of The Apprentice.


---

[Scene Four: Monica and Rachel’s apartment. Monica is obsessively cleaning while Chandler lounges on the couch.]

Monica: (scrubbing furiously) I can’t take it. Trump is the leader of the free world, and I can’t even keep my spice rack in alphabetical order. What is happening to the world?

Chandler: (smirking) Don’t worry, Mon. When the apocalypse comes, at least your spice rack will be “cumin”-ready.

Monica: (glaring) Don’t joke. This is serious! What if this inspires other crazy people to run for office? What if... (gasps) Joey runs for mayor?

Joey: (walking in) Wait, I can do that? Cool! I’ll make Mondays illegal. And I’ll rename pizza “Joey Bread.”

Chandler: (mocking) Yeah, because “Joey Bread” definitely rolls off the tongue. Sounds like something you’d buy from a sketchy food truck.

[Scene Five: Central Perk. Phoebe is practicing her new political protest song.]

Phoebe: (singing with her guitar)
♪ He’s orange and he’s loud, with a tie that’s too long,
Tweets at 3 AM—what could go wrong? ♪

Gunther: (walking over) Phoebe, can you not sing about Trump? It’s upsetting the customers.

Phoebe: (serious) Gunther, art is about pushing boundaries. If I don’t sing about him, who will?

Gunther: (dryly) Literally everyone on Twitter.

Chandler: (to Gunther) Don’t worry, I’ll tweet at him to let him know Central Perk is his safe space. I’m sure he loves coffee shops that don’t serve “tremendous” coffee.


---

[Scene Six: The White House. The gang has somehow been invited to attend a press event.]

Rachel: (whispering) How did we even get in here? Did they not check our names?

Chandler: (shrugging) Apparently, all you need is a tie and the ability to say “fake news” convincingly.

Monica: (wide-eyed) Oh my God, everything is so clean! Look at this marble floor! I’d eat off of it.

Joey: (bending down) Wait, are you allowed to eat off the floor here? Asking for a friend.

Ross: (pulling Joey up) Joey, we’re in the White House. Don’t embarrass us.

Joey: (grinning) Relax, Ross. If Trump can live here, I can at least eat a bagel off the floor.

Trump’s Bodyguard: (approaching) Excuse me. Are you Phoebe Buffay?

Phoebe: (excited) Yes! Finally, someone who recognizes talent.

Trump’s Bodyguard: The president loved your song and wants you to perform it during his next rally.

Phoebe: (jumping) Yes! I knew my art would change the world. Do I get a limo ride? I want a limo.

Chandler: (mocking) Great. Now Phoebe’s going to be his Secretary of Weird Songs.

[Final Scene: The gang is escorted out of the White House after Joey tries to take a souvenir.]

Joey: (holding up a golden pen) What? I thought this was free!

Secret Service Agent: Sir, you can’t just take the president’s pen.

Chandler: (mock serious) Joey, you’re embarrassing us in front of the Secret Service. Again.

Rachel: (to Monica) I told you we shouldn’t have brought Joey. This is worse than that time he stole the cheesecake.

Phoebe: (singing as they’re dragged out)
♪ We’re leaving the White House, and it’s such a shame,
But at least Joey got a pen with Trump’s name! ♪

Ross: (to everyone) Okay, nobody tell my mom about this. She’ll never let me live it down.

Monica: (glaring at Joey) Joey, you’ve ruined everything. Again!

Joey: (defensive) Oh, come on! If Trump can run the country, I can take one little pen!

[End credits: The gang is sitting back at Central Perk, watching Phoebe’s performance on TV. Trump awkwardly dances to her song.]

Chandler: (sipping coffee) Well, that’s it. Civilization as we know it is officially over.

Sorry it a long one but please help,"9 years ago I moved out of my parents and started to rent with my ex fiancé in a little house about 15 minutes from my parents at the time they were amazing supportive, my mum would text from time to time seeing how we were, how the house was doing ect. Unfortunately the relationship only lasted 4 months after we moved in together so I had to move back in with my parents thankfully their house was big so I had my own space (bathroom, bedroom and living room).
2 years ago I moved out and moved in with my ex boyfriend who lived 45 minutes away from my parents, my mum would text and call everyday i worked close to my parents house (I work nights) if I didn't have work the next night I would stop off in the morning on my way home for a coffee and a chat with my mum. Then I found out I was pregnant the calls and texting even showing up at our flat became more and more, my parents then moved into a bungalow a extra 20 minutes from the old house (from my flat to the bungalow it was 1 hour 5 minutes one way) me and my ex were in a bad place he changed he became violent, abusive and very controlling (i hid everything from my friends and family), I found out at my 12 week scan that I had lost out baby (this was my first pregnancy) I was heart broken completely lost didn't know what to do with myself, I would cry all the time or have no emotion at all didn't want to see or speak to anyone. A month after me loosing our baby i went back to my parents as they could see I was shutting everyone out and they wanted me home, I went home for a week and at the end of that week I found out my ex had been cheating on me the whole relationship he had been seeing this woman for about 5 years when I found out, we were only together for 11 months when it ended. 
Iv have started to find myself again and wanted to move out and get a place for myself and my 2 cats but renting is expensive and I heard a mate from work was also looking for a place so we both decided to find a house together spilt the bills 50/50. We got our keys to our house back in December 2024 just before Christmas but we both work (she works days i still work nights) we had to clean and decorate the house before we moved him which took about 3 weeks to do with work and personal life's it was hard to find time to get to the house to do what we needed. My mum has been ill for about 7 months now she has been living with my nan (her mum who lives 15 minutes away from my parents bungalow) for 6 months she needed 24/7 care and me and my dad both worked my mum wouldn't allow us to take time off work to care for her. The start of December she started to come home and stay for the weekends I was off so I could care for her (which I don't mind i work as a carer/support worker) she has become more and more stronger which is amazing im so proud of her but she has become VERY needy. I have officially been living in my own house for about 2 weeks now (25 minutes from my parents place) my work pattern for 1 week i will work Saturday night to Wednesday night so 5 nights in a row have a night off then work 1 night. So last week that was my pattern every night my mum would ask if i would pop round in the morning to help her with 1 thing or another they live in the opposite direction from work to my new house When i finish work i want to go home have food, shower then relax then try get to sleep. Just before Christmas I was diagnosed with migraines with the move and my mum being ill I have had really bad ones over the last few weeks. When I said no I couldn't go round one morning (Wednesday morning i called in sick to work Wednesday night) because I had a migraine starting she became moody, blunt in her replies, wouldn't answer my calls when she did answer she would keep putting the phone down etc. On Friday night which was my night to work again I get a text from my mum asking me to go round Saturday morning to help her with stuff (I haven't heard from her in a couple days at this point) I said yes she becomes all sweet, loving, like nothing has happened. She does this alot when she don't get her own way I don't like talking bad about her as she is like me and is a people pleaser and my mum and i love her with all my heart but when things don't go her own way she's not a nice woman and yet again im the problem. Iv tried talking to her in the past about this it works for about a month or so then she's right back to it. 
This week is my last week at my current job I'm going back to days next week with a new company I'm only working 2 night this week Monday and Tuesday I get a text Monday night asking if I can pop round in the morning to take my mum to see her mum then take her back. she knows I'm working Monday and Tuesday so it's another day of no sleep. I have been told I need to get regular sleep to help with my migraines. 
When my mum was ill for the 6 months she was living at my nans my mum would still call me ask me to take her to her drs appointments hospital appointments of course I would take her as I was the only one free in the day to take her (I wasn't really free as that was my time to sleep) but these appointments was important to try and find out what was wrong with her. Because of all the sleep I had lost helping her out I now struggle to get to sleep after 2 pm if im working that night 

I'm just getting tired of wanting to better myself, grow on my own, have fun, spend time with friends, not have to constantly let someone know what I'm doing, where I'm going, who I'm seeing. I just want to be me but at the same time I don't want to cut my parents out but that is the only thing I can think of to be able to live peacefully. 
I just feel like I'm spending more time at my parents house than I am my own at the moment and iv only just moved in. 

I feel really petty writing this but I need help as I don't know what else I can do or say to my mum to give me a bit of a break. 

Please help!!!",1,1738045305.0,FamilyIssues,2,1.0,False
1ibvdal,https://www.reddit.com/r/okstorytime/comments/1ibvdal/the_saga_of_my_worst_employee/,The saga of my worst employee,"Hello OK Storytime, this is Ezekiel and this is one of my throw away accounts. I want to share my story about the worst employee I’ve ever had. For context, I work at a University in the United States. I am a Supervisor for a night shift crew that does maintenance on campus. I’ve seen a lot of shenanigans, some funny, some serious. The funny ones include:

·         Finding an employee fishing during work hours.

·         Catching 2 employees with a truck driving around a parking lot in circles. They were playing Pokemon Go.

·         Finding a group of them all sitting around on their phones. They didn’t notice me until I was right behind them.

·         Seeing an employee attend a Union meeting which was supposed to count as his break. He stayed for his original break too and basically took 1.5 hour break.

·         Finding an employee making a Mine Craft pickaxe out of cardboard for his son.

As I said, I’m the Supervisor and I’m in charge of around 20 people. Overall, we are pretty chill group and I didn’t make a big deal of these incidents. I have a good crew, and we generally get along, respect each other and get the job done. I don’t have a problem with people slacking off occasionally if it’s not illegal and they get their work done.

Now, at my work, employee rights are very strong. It’s very difficult to get rid of an employee who is past probation unless they do something pretty awful. In the 90’s and early 2000’s, we had a lot of party animals who would get away with murder. Drinking, dr\*gs and sleeping on the job weren’t uncommon. Over the years, these became less and less and there was a big crackdown in the mid-2000’s. It’s a very different scene and these kinds of activities aren’t overlooked anymore. However, getting someone fired is still very hard and requires obscene levels of bureaucracy.

Now I will introduce you to Sam, my POS employee (sorry Sam, I’ve picked on Dakota enough). I need to keep his description a little vague to avoid doxing him, but he was a dirty guy. Bad hygiene, always had dirt or grease on his hands (he worked on cars), unwashed clothes and honestly looked homeless. He was called out several times for being in restricted areas because someone thought he was homeless. I had to force him to wear his ID badge and wear his uniform to keep that from happening. I hired him based on a recommendation from one of his friends who was on the crew. I took a shot and hired him. For the first couple of years, he would get a little arrogant at times, but largely I thought he was ok. I knew he drank and smoked “the devil’s lettuce” at home, but I don’t care as long as it doesn’t come into work. Occasionally, someone would tell me they smelled alcohol or p\*t on him, but it was always after the fact. They would tell me days or weeks after they smelled it, which gave me no way to fact check it. When I asked Sam about it, he swore that he would “never risk his job for that”. Oh, how naive and trusting I was…

One fault my crew has is they don’t tell on each other. They “won’t say crap with a mouthful” as one of my Leads told me. The whole, “snitches get stitches” mentality hid Sam’s problems for years. Even then, there were some signs that I wish I had followed up sooner. The biggest was an incident at a coffee shop on campus. He randomly showed up there in the evening while they were serving customers. He walked behind the counter and went into the back room without even saying hello to the baristas. With him looking homeless and acting drunk or high, he scared them, and they called the police. As he walked out, he vaguely said he was “with maintenance” and needed to check something. He left before the police arrived and I was notified about it the next day. When I spoke to Sam about it, he claimed, “I said hello and identified myself and I guess I wasn’t clear. Next time, I will talk more to them”. I told him it was completely unacceptable, and I wasn’t even sure what he was doing there in the first place. I gave him a written warning and told him if he was drinking at work, he was risking his job. He again told me, “I’d never risk my job” and the matter was settled for now.

Fast forward a couple of years and the same random “I smelled p\*t or alcohol” accusations came in, but always after the fact. All the evidence amounted to a nothing sandwich. I couldn’t actually do anything, and the crew refused to actually tell on him. Finally, in early 2022, was my first break. I got reports of someone hanging out in a building they weren’t supposed to be in. I thought it was another employee who was working in the building. A month prior I had to talk to because he was using someone’s office for their breaks. I went to the building to observe him and catch him in the act, but instead, I found Sam and his partner John (We always work in pairs or groups for safety at night). I saw their truck parked at the building, but they were supposed to be working across campus. They had no reason to be there and this was at the beginning of the shift. I watched their truck for over an hour before Sam came back. Later that night, I called both Sam and John into my office and asked them what they were doing. John said he was taking a nap in the truck while he was waiting for Sam. He didn’t realize how much time had passed. Sam said he “had to use the bathroom and I really like the bathroom” in that building….FOR A F-ING HOUR. This was an obvious lie and both he and John were giving written warnings.

A month or two later, I decided to do a surprise inspection on a job they were working on because it was taking much longer than it should have. One of my Leads, Ray, and I discreetly visited the job. We eventually found John sitting in a classroom, feet on the desk and he was playing a game or something on his phone. I came in and asked him, “Where is Sam?” John initially said, “Bathroom?” in a very unconvincing tone. He immediately broke and said, “I can’t keep covering for him. I have no idea where he is.” This wasn’t a surprise at all since we had already checked the building and he wasn’t there. I texted Sam and he read it right away but didn’t respond for 8 minutes. He finally replied, “I’m at the building, what’s up?” Obviously, he was heading back to the building and trying to buy time. Ray ran into him a few minutes later walking towards the building. He was caught red handed. I gave Sam a written write up for lying, not being at his work site and not working during work hours. I also wrote up John. John was pissed. He yelled and ranted about getting in trouble because of Sam’s actions, but I told him, “You’re not being written up for what he did. You’re being written up because you lied and enabled him”. Looking back, this was the beginning of the end.

Fast forward to the summer and a lot of small things came up. Sam was literally falling asleep while others were working, taking extra smoke breaks and generally pissing off the crew. John ended up leaving for another job and said in his exit interview that it was largely because of Sam. John leaving changed something with the crew and more people started speaking up when Sam was slacking off. I made it easy and anonymous for them to tip me off and I would do all the leg work. It was reported that he was stealing, dr\*nk/high and harassing crew members. Of course, all of this was reported after the fact so I didn’t have any evidence. Finally, I decided to basically start stalking him; though I want to think of it as a stake out or being a spy. Sounds cooler. I literally watched him leave on his break, leave campus in a work truck (big no-no) and drive home. He only lived 5 minutes away and I got a photo of his work truck at his house. I decided to bide my time and did the same thing again the next day. This time, he didn’t drive home. He drove to a local bar he frequents. I found out later that he basically went to this bar almost everyday, on company time, in a work truck. I got photos, stormed into the bar and took his keys. Didn’t even say anything to him besides demanding the keys. He blew up my phone defending himself and said he wasn’t drinking. Ignored him. A week later, we have a fact finding.

Now before I go further, let me tell you how these things go for disciplinary action. First, if you break the rules or under perform, you’re given an informal talking to. Next, you get an informal written warning. Then a formal written warning. This step can repeat several times depending on the severity. The rule of thumb is 3 but it can greatly vary. If they feel like you are just unable or unwilling to change, it will advance to a Final written warning. If they still don’t change, then it goes to dismissal. Even then, they’re given one last change with the Director before they officially let go. The entire time they’re able to get a rep from the Union to talk to and help them, kind of like a lawyer. It’s a slow and painful process.

So for this fact finding, we decided to go straight to Final Warning after everything that happened. With him being at a bar, using a work truck, etc. He skipped a lot of the process. He lied the entire time claimed he only drank OJ and Redbull. It’s called a Vitamin-C (except left out the orange vodka part). The union rep was of no help to him since the evidence was overwhelming and he had no defense. The rep even went as far as to criticize him for taking extra breaks, which violated the contract. Long story short, he was on thin ice. HR decided there was insufficient evidence on the drinking because I didn’t see the drink get made. Stupid, I know. Because every know you go to a bar to buy an expensive non-alcoholic drink? Sure.

For the next few months, he stayed relatively clean. However, right after Christmas, he was seen slacking off on another job. This alone wasn’t enough evidence, but it as clear he was reverting back to his old ways. Again, I started stalking him and one day I stayed late on a Friday. His guard was down and he thought I was gone. I went to the building he was working in and found him in a janitor’s closet. He literally made himself a small bed, was eating ramen and had a tablet and was watching TV. He even brough a small portable speaker to hear his show better. I completely lost it. I had photos of him and just walked up to him and said, “Really?!?!”. He started sputtering an excuse but I was done. I said, “I don’t want to hear any more of your stupid lies” and left before I cursed him out. He texted me ranting about how I was picking on him and singling him out. He threatened to call the Union and file a complaint with HR. I told him, “GO AHEAD! I’ve already told them exactly what happened and you will be hearing from us.” Unfortunately, friends, this is where the real BS begins.

The day before his next fact-finding meeting, he suddenly “got sick” and went out on FMLA. For those who don’t know, FMLA is the Family Medical Leave Act in the US. It basically protects someone’s job if they or a family member get sick or injured for 3 months. He got some scummy doctor to sign off on his fake illness and he left. He used his PTO while he was gone so he was paid the entire time. This completely stalled the entire investigation until he returned. When he finally came back, we only worked half a day and had to go home because he was shaking and pale, which we believed to be alcohol withdrawals. We suspected he came back to work since he was out of money and probably didn’t have money for booze. Looking back, this could have killed him.

Finally, we had the fact-finding and it was more lame excuses, denying he did anything wrong and blaming me for “picking” on him again. He called me “creepy” for spying on him and questioned why I was even following him. I simply told him, “That’s literally my job”. He tried to blame his crew and said that they weren’t working either, but I observed them working before I found him. Obviously, we concluded that he did was he was accused of. After 6 months of delay, he was issued a 2^(nd) Final Warning …no that’s not an error. HR decided he needed to really, truly understand this was the last dance. You can’t make this crap up. I kid you not, he lasted 1 week before he f-ed up again. Not only that, he did it in an epic trilogy of f-ck ups, all in one day.

**Bear in mind all of this happened in 1 day:**

1.      At the beginning of our shift, we had a special training session on some new equipment. This was in a loud area with 20 people attending. Somehow, he fell asleep while squatting against the wall. Full head down asleep. He was wearing sunglasses inside (which was very unusual to begin with) and he couldn’t stay awake. Bear in mind this was very loud and the instructor was literally 3 feet away from him. Everyone saw this and I just took pictures. We thought he might be drunk so I arranged for the University Police to pull him over and check him out. Somehow, he managed to fool them and they didn’t do a breathalyzer. The cop later told me, “Only high functioning alc\*holics could fool me”. I responded, “Well, that’s exactly what we’re dealing with here.”

2.      After the police, he left for a while to “cool off”, since he as so upset. He came back a hour later and I decided to set him up. I had Ray send him to a large auditorium where he could fix some stuff. I had the perfect hiding spot in the projector room and was waiting for him when he arrived. He spent a couple of minutes looking at the room, quickly found a seat and went to sleep for the next 30 minutes. He was so still, the lights turned off automatically after 20 minutes.  I got pictures and video of him sleeping all that time. When he finally woke up, left, and reported to Ray that everything was fine. I literally found several broken parts that need fixing in the same row that he slept in. I knew I had him, but I wasn’t done yet.

3.      After I went back to the office and talked to Ray, I was happy that I found what I needed to bury Sam. However, before Ray left for the night, I asked him to swing by where Sam was working. I told him to just “check in” with Sam and see if we could catch him at anything else. Well, sure as sh\*t, Ray saw the icing on the cake. 30 minutes after his last break ended, Ray saw Sam in a classroom, watching TV, no tools in site and a hamburger on the table. Here he was, taking another break. He snuck a quick photo for evidence and Sam claimed, he was “almost done here”. He obviously wasn’t doing anything at all. In a full 10-hour shift, he maybe did about 15 minutes of actual work.

With this mountain of evidence, I went to HR again. I had witnesses, video, and photos. We called him into another fact-finding meeting. This time, HR decided to catch him in a lie. They told him what he was accused of and he of course denied it and claimed I was just making up stories because “for some reason, Ezekiel doesn’t like me. I’m the hardest worker here and I haven’t done anything he said I did.” Then HR showed the photos. This meeting was on Zoom so HR pulled up each photo with the metadata to show dates and times. Sam was completely silent for 10 whole seconds…

After that, HR simply asked him, “Is this you?”. Sam replied, “Well it appears to be me…”. He then started on another long rant about how I was picking on him, how I was creepy for spying on him, blah blah blah. It got so bad, the Union Rep asked for a break and they left for a while to talk to him privately. HR and I immediately burst out laughing in pure shock and a little stress relief. They were gone for more than 15 minutes before they finally came back. After he came back, Sam simply stated, “I didn’t sleep on the job”. He doubled down on his lie, with proof he was lying. The battle was won, but the war wasn’t over yet.

Unsurprisingly, he went out on medical leave again. This time, he used a government medical leave program to pay him for 3 months since he had no more PTO. Yes, this was fraud, but it would have been hard to prove, and it was pointless anyway. Once this ran out, he came back to work again. In the end, this really didn’t change anything since the dismissal process takes an insane amount of time. We weren’t ready to proceed with his firing until a couple of weeks after he came back. Even then, he had one final chance to plead his case with our Director. He was scheduled for a meeting with the Director, HR, and the Union Rep. I wasn’t included in this meeting. He would be given a chance to talk to the Director to give him one last opportunity to say anything in his defense. However, at the last minute, he canceled. Sam spoke to the Union and they must have told him it was over. They negotiated another month of benefits for him in exchange for him leaving peacefully. He agreed and never returned. He stole a few more things before he left but we decided to let it go. It all ended unceremoniously. The entire sage from when I first found him “using the bathroom” until he was fired took just under 2 years.

Overall, I learned a lot of lessons with this and I hope I’m a better boss because of it. He was toxic, unproductive and honestly a danger to himself and others. I don’t regret what I did but it was hard. It’s hard to fire someone in general but even more with the crazy red tape. If I hadn’t pushed for it, he would still work here. I had to dedicate myself to make it happen and I lost a lot of sleep and energy because of it. When he was officially gone, I took a night off, went into the City and walked in the rain for hours. I just listened to an audio book (Interview with a Vampire) and just walked and walked. I heard recently that Sam was forced to stop dr\*nking because he developed Cirrhosis of the liver. He was looking pretty bad and my guess is he will probably die in the next few years. I do hope he gets better but I’ve seen a lot of friends and family go down this road. It rarely ends well. Thank you for listening to my story OK Family (or Little Sillies). Thanks to John, Sophia, Riley, Keian, Dakota (who I love to give a hard time to) and of course, the star of the show, Sam. I’ve been listening for a few years now and you used to annoy me with the banter. Now it’s my favorite part. John and Sam grew on me like a wart and this is the only channel I am a member of.

But you might be wondering: *Can I put coffee in my Stanley Cup?* 

The answer is a resounding **yes!** Let’s explore why your Stanley tumbler is perfect for coffee and how to make the most of it.

# Designed for All Beverages

Stanley tumblers are crafted with double-wall vacuum insulation, which means they excel at keeping drinks at their intended temperature. For coffee lovers, this means your coffee will stay hot for up to 7 hours, letting you sip and savor your brew throughout the day. Whether you’re rushing out the door in the morning or enjoying a relaxed afternoon, your Stanley tumbler ensures your coffee stays piping hot.

# Safe and Reliable Materials

One of the best features of Stanley tumblers is their use of food-grade stainless steel. Unlike some materials, stainless steel doesn’t retain flavors or odors, so you don’t have to worry about your coffee leaving behind a lingering taste. This makes it easy to switch between coffee, water, or any other beverage without affecting the flavor.

# Easy to Clean

Cleaning your tumbler is simple. Stanley tumblers are dishwasher-safe (be sure to check the lid care instructions). If you prefer handwashing, a quick rinse with warm, soapy water will do the trick. For an occasional deep clean, you can use a mixture of baking soda and water or a splash of vinegar to eliminate any coffee oils or residue.

**Tips for the Best Coffee Experience**

* **Preheat Your Tumbler:** Before pouring in your coffee, rinse the tumbler with hot water. This helps maintain the coffee’s heat longer.
* **Avoid Stains:** To keep your tumbler looking pristine, rinse it soon after finishing your coffee.
* **Use a Lid with a Straw:** If you’re drinking iced coffee, the FlowState™ lid with a straw makes it easy and spill-free.

Your Stanley tumbler isn’t just for water or cold drinks—it’s a fantastic companion for your coffee, too. Its insulation, durable materials, and easy maintenance make it ideal for both hot and iced coffee. So go ahead and pour your favorite brew into your Stanley cup—you’ll love the experience!

Enjoy your coffee and stay hydrated! ☕✨
