1jq1ekb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jq1ekb,Mitch finds someone (Mitchell's stories),"My day started with the echo of an empty house. My mother and brother had left to see a movie, leaving me alone. A couple of months ago, my wife and I fought, and it ended in divorce, a divorce I never was against. I wasn't the man she had married, not anymore. I had become this sad fucking hollow version of myself. The silence settled in, wrapping around me like a heavy fog. I'd been alone before, sure, but at least then, I knew I'd hear their voices again. Now, I was truly alone.

I sat at the kitchen table, my good hand wrapped around a cup of coffee gone cold, my robotic arm resting uselessly at my side. The metal fingers twitched occasionally, as if haunted by the memory of holding something, maybe a rifle, maybe my daughter’s tiny hand.

The war had taken my right eye and my right arm, but none of that prepared me for this kind of loss. I had fought in deserts and trenches, seen men die, and made it home when others didn’t, I had survived injuries that would have killed tougher men than me. And yet, somehow, I still lost the only two people who made surviving it all worth it. All because I couldn’t let go of a stupid fucking grudge.

The note my wife left sat crumpled on the table. I had read it too many times. At first, anger had burned a hole through me. Now, there was just a dull ache, a pain that hurt for all the wrong fucking reasons. I had everything, and I threw it all away. I took a sip of my last drink, thinking about what I could have done differently. My lips met the ice, the cold sting against my mouth making me pause. I had problems. I couldn’t forgive. I couldn’t forget. And now, I was out of booze.

I should stop. But fuck it, I wasn't getting any happier. Maybe I should get out, see something besides these empty walls. I found a decent shirt and a pair of pants to match. It felt strange, covering up after being shirtless for so long. Doubling down, I put on the suit jacket, the one my wife, no, one I had gotten as a gift. The fabric strained slightly as my right arm slid into the sleeve, bolts adjusting with a quiet squeak. Maybe I should cover it. I didn’t want to freak out a kid. Actually, that could be funny.

I was ready. No plan. Just a need to be somewhere, anywhere but here.

I got into my car and drove, not really thinking, like sleepwalking behind the wheel. I was there, but not there at the same time. Just driving like a ghost.

I ended up at a bar just outside town, the kind with low lighting, cheap booze, and questions no one dared ask. I wasn’t much of a drinker anymore, but tonight, a bottle felt like better company than my own fucked-up thoughts.

Halfway through my second glass, someone slid onto the stool beside me. I ignored them at first, too lost in the swirl of whiskey, but they didn’t leave.

“You look like you could use a distraction.” The voice was smooth, confident, impossible to pin down.

I turned my head, eyeing the stranger. Sharp features, an easy smile, and an effortless way about them. Their clothes were somewhere between casual and stylish, just enough mystery to keep me guessing.

I smirked. “That obvious?”

They grinned. “Only a little.”

The conversation started with nothing, bad weather, overpriced drinks, the terrible music from the old jukebox in the corner. But soon, it became something else. Before I knew it, I was laughing, something I hadn’t done in what felt like ages. The weight on my chest didn’t disappear, but for the first time in days, it loosened just enough for me to breathe.

“Come on,” they said, standing up and offering their hand. “I know somewhere better.”

I hesitated for half a second before grabbing it except I used my metal hand. My fingers closed around theirs, and I braced for the scream.

Instead, they lit up with awe. “Oh, cool hand!”

“You’re not hurt, right?” I asked, my heart still lodged in my throat.

“No, actually, it’s... surprisingly soft?” they said, tilting their head in curiosity.

I was going to spin some fake story about an accident, but then they rolled up my sleeve, revealing the full metal limb. Instead of recoiling, they smiled.

“That’s badass,” they said, admiration clear in their voice.

Something stirred in my chest, something strange, something I hadn’t felt in a long fucking time. It hurt, but in a way that wasn’t entirely unpleasant, I think I actually felt, good?

Before I knew it, they had called a ride. They wanted to take me somewhere.

I didn’t know where we were going. Didn’t know what this night would mean. But for now, I didn’t care. For now, I wasn’t alone.",2,1743631804.0,OriginalCharacter,0,1.0,False

Hey MaximizeMe community! 🌟 Ever rolled out of bed, checked your phone, got sucked into email chaos, and suddenly it’s lunchtime before you’ve even started anything meaningful? 🕒 Yeah, been there. Just a couple months back, I was convinced that the more I crammed into my morning routine, the more productive my day would be. Spoiler alert: I was wrong. 😅

Here's a little dive into how I turned things around with a simple concept: **habit stacking**—and ended up saving a whopping 10 hours a week! 🎉

**What's Going Wrong in the AM?**

1. **The Distraction Spiral**: Grabbing your phone first thing? Total focus killer. Once you're scrolling, those minutes (or hours) just disappear. 🌀
   
2. **Overloading the To-Do List**: Attempting to go from yoga to deep meditation to journaling, and then cooking an Instagram-worthy breakfast? Exhausting just typing that out, TBH.

3. **Lack of Priority**: Not all tasks are equal, but treating them like they are? Major time-waster.

Sound familiar? Here’s where habit stacking swoops in to save the day...

**How Habit Stacking Changed My Life:**

- **Step 1: Single Change Start**—Focus on adding just *one* productive habit to an existing morning activity. I started with brewing my coffee and using those 5 minutes to set clear priorities for the day. ☕✍️
  
- **Step 2: Pair It Up**—Already do something daily without thinking about it? Stack a small task onto it. For me, it was sipping that glorious first cup of coffee + quick journal prompts. Double win! 🎯

- **Step 3: Evolve It Gradually**—Stacking isn’t about huge changes overnight. Slowly added a short meditative session while waiting for my toast—it’s all about the small, extra bits. 🤏

This approach helped me reclaim my focus, rescue my mornings, and suddenly, I wasn’t hitting afternoon burnout as often. Imagine having extra time in your day without sacrificing personal well-being. 🚀

Curious about how my mornings look now?

- **No Phone** (Yes, really. Feels liberating!)
- **Coffee + Priority List**
- **Toast + Meditation**
- **Stretching + Podcast** 🎧

It’s wild how correcting just a few small missteps in your routine can lead to a huge payoff. Now, mornings feel less like a race and more like a refreshing paddle down a calm river.

**Got any secret morning rituals yourself?** Or maybe you're on the hunt for more productivity hacks? Let's swap tips and learn from each other's wins... and fails. 😜",1,1743631734.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

Started with weight loss in 2022 and into the new year of 2023 if I remember rightly. I dropped from about 14-15stone right down to just under 10 stone. Unexplained however I was going through some stress with a previous partner which could have been a huge factor or just a coincidence in the start of this illness.

October 31st 2023 woke up with what felt like norovirus, I kept dry heaving for around 30 minutes solid with nothing coming up except a small amount of brown liquid (empty stomach, Chinese for tea the night before) I understand this was probably just food colouring, it wasn’t like coffee granules which I know needs to be watched out for.

Few days go by I was absolutely fine, then all of a sudden a wave of nausea comes again, I go to be sick and nothing comes up… dry heaving AGAIN. 

From that moment every single day I can be going about my day as normal then all of a sudden waves of severe nausea comes over me from anywhere that lasts from 10 minutes to 10 hours! At the end of the nausea 99 percent of the time it’s finished and settled by my dry heaving and then only it will settle. Empty stomach or full stomach vomit never produces it’s always dry heaving.  

We are now coming upto 2 years, it’s affecting my mental health, wondering every day when it’s going to start which it happens everyday without fail, sometimes once, sometimes 20 times, there’s no pattern.

This is taking a strain on my work life, personal life, relationship with my partner and my own mental wellbeing. I can’t have a plan to do anything or normal activity’s as I’m always taking anti sickness medication around with me for the nausea for bad flare ups (ondansatron) 

It’s not getting better, it’s the same or worse at times.

I can’t sometimes have a stool movement which is normal and then not long after need to go again which a small amount comes out including a tiny minimal amount of mucus, not always but it happens at times every few days to weeks. 

Would like to mention I’ve put weight back on and no issues with weight as I’m not losing any or anything dramatic like I did, I haven’t weighed myself since I dropped so low however I’d like to think I’m about 13 stone now maybe slightly more. 6ft 1 in height. 

Exercise- recently started playing football, when bursting into runs after around 10-15 minutes into every game I have to stop and stand at the sideline to dry heave a few times then I can continue. 

From my own research, it points towards one of these which I feel I should be tested for, some have been tested for but in my opinion needs re testing as symptoms still haven’t changed and only gotten worse: 

- Colon Cancer (or cancers in general) 
- Superior mesenteric artery syndrome
- GERD
- IBS/IBD
- Food/any intolerances 
- Gallbladder 
- Esophageal candidiasis


My previous endoscopy found the following:
- Esophageal candidiasis (don’t know if this has gone or not due to not having any following ups or check ups from anybody. No indication or anyone telling me the causes of this. 

Other previous results which may or may not be playing a factor:
- Calprotectin 110ug/g (lowered on the follow up test right back down) 
- 2023 November, prolactin levels high (628) during hospital stay 
- HIVscreen: Negative 
- CT Scan… Incidental hypodense focal lesion on Right lobe of liver

Final additional notes which could or could not be a factor, as symptoms started and I haven’t felt right since also: 
X2 Pfizer Covid Vaccines (June 2021) 


I understand this is a lot of things going on, but I need to desperately find an answer on what this could be. This is an open timeline for which I want to share with you the reader, doctor, specialists & online forums,

Any ideas, help, similar stories would be greatly appreciated.

I want my life back, I’m 29 years old and feel I have no normal life and I just want to be happy and find out what is going on.

1jq1690,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1jq1690/why_cant_i_make_decaf_espresso_niche_zero_gaggia/,Why can’t I make decaf espresso? [Niche zero / Gaggia Classic E24],"Hey everyone, as the title says I’m really struggling to get proper espresso out of almost any decaf beans with the setup mentioned. 

I have a niche zero which I clean regularly and a new gaggia e24 with a brass boiler. this setup works really well and I am not yet thinking of modding the gaggia but I upgraded to an IMS basket. 

I tend to mostly do regular coffee espressos mainly due to the frustration I have had in the past with any decaf. 

I usually grind on 17/18 on the niche for espresso and get good results, I am pretty good at dialing things in and have a bottomless portafilter. the decaf seems to need a much much finer grind: 10 or 11, to even get any sort of crema and to not flow super fast. 

It’s still a really fast shot (30g in 15s) on Niche size 10 and it doesn’t taste right either. I also notice the decaf is much more clumpy than the regular beans and much more oily. 

I have tried all types of decaf (Swiss water, ethyl acetate, etc. ) it just won’t work. 

I don’t think the gaggia is doing anything wrong either as I had exactly the same problem with the manual espresso makers like picopresso. 

 It’s either the niche or I don’t know something about decaf. It doesn’t feel like coffee somehow!

1jq165r,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostafriend/comments/1jq165r/i_worry_about_her_all_the_time/,I worry about her all the time,"This has had me scratching my head for over a year now. I had a friend who I had known and been friends with since we were little kids. I thought the world of her and told her that all the time. I tried to support her interests and encourage her about things that could go unnoticed by others. I was always there for her to talk to and lean on if she ever wanted, and she was for me too. Then, I went through a really difficult time with the unexpected onset of serious mental health issues. I had a physical health scare too. We chatted here and there about it, but overall I really isolated myself. I missed a day when I should have sent her a message, and when I realized I missed it I thought about it for days. Finally I worked up the courage to reach out and apologize and explain. She said she understood and seemed fine with it, not thrilled but understanding. Then, a while later she asked me to do some research for her in my field. Don’t want to trigger anyone but I’ll just say I was living day to day at the time just trying to stay afloat. I would frequently  remember she had asked for it but didn’t complete it quickly, and she never brought it up again. I did it a few months later, and reached out to say sorry for my delay, she may have figured it out but if not I’ve done it and would be happy to share. She responded saying she didn’t want me to waste my time on it or something like that, shut me down which was odd. So a while later when I was doing a bit better i asked to meet up for coffee and I explained that I wanted to apologize and connect. She said ok but said it in a massive text that basically said she was purposely not speaking to me anymore and had stepped back from our friendship and “I knew why.” 

I couldn’t figure out for the longest time what she was talking about. All I could think of were those ^ two instances. So I profusely apologized and told her how much I cared about her, but she was very closed off over text, I took the hint and didn’t press her. I confided in my other friends obviously, for support, and told them I was worried about her and didn’t understand what was going on. I assured them that nothing would change in terms of my willingness to come around if she was there, and that was it.

Months and months later, she messages me out of the blue accusing me of talking behind her back. I mean this with all sincerity, I never said anything negatively about her as a person, only that I was hurt and worried about her and could not figure out why she had done this, as in what had I done wrong? So I responded somewhat defending myself and I asked her to clarify why she made this choice. She essentially said that I had been asking her for advice too often. I kid you not we didn’t even speak once every two weeks in the timeframe she was referring to. I think less, I would check our texts but it makes me sad lol. I feel like she was never able to articulate a real reason for doing this, even when asked point blank. If anything I wish she asked me for more advice - I love doing that for my friends. I don’t see what’s wrong with occasionally doing that.

The only thing I can think of that makes any sense is that I did isolate myself a lot while I was struggling. But I did that with everyone, and she is the only person in my life who dropped me. I’m very open about what I’ve been going through, apologetic and understanding. I’ve had one other friend straight up not invite me to her birthday and when I asked to chat she said it was because I hadn’t been around, and I completely understood and we immediately connected about what I was going through and how I could improve my communication so she still felt support from me even if I couldn’t physically be super present sometimes. I have had so many people just care if I’m ok and pick back up with me whenever I’m able. Not a single other soul has dropped me like she did and I cared about her more than most. It’s been like over a year now but I’m still gutted. I guess I’m wondering if there’s anything i could be missing here?? ",1,1743631230.0,lostafriend,0,1.0,False

1jq14s9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Candida/comments/1jq14s9/how_to_make_your_candida_experience_easier/,How to make your Candida experience easier.,"Hi all,

so I am writing this as someone who has had a horrible time with SIBO/Candida, though I won't get into the SIBO.

This is my 3rd round of treating candida but I've treated it twice before, and both times were HORRIBLE. Once with herbals, another time with Nystatin, now I am on Nystatin again. **I am writing this as someone who is experiencing absolutely no die-off, and feels great on Nystatin.** After my last 2 rounds, I was insanely scared to get on this medication.

The first time I was treating Candida was with herbals (a Desbio protocol, not as popular as other herbal supplements). I had extreme panic attacks, and was emotionally unstable while treating it. This was after I had actually gotten rid of SIBO (for 4 months) and I am pretty sure the stress of trying to treat candida brought my SIBO back.

2nd time (last June?) was way worse. I felt like a mix between a crying 5 year old child and a person on a bad acid trip. Had zero energy, was extremely fatigued, my days were not ""right""/very foggy. Had to take a binder just to get through the treatment. Only did this for 2 weeks, didn't finish the 3rd week. After this I spent months basically bedridden. Lost any sort of appetite I had, had ZERO energy, breathing problems, could hardly stand up, just all around bad.

So, you can imagine, treating candida for a third time I am shocked how well I feel. Doesn't even feel like I'm treating anything except that I generally feel better. So let's get into what I changed, without a long story:

**1. Environment.** This is the most underrated contributor to die-off. There's environment and there's endocrine disruptors. They somewhat go hand in hand.

Environment is where you live, the air you breathe. Living in a clean environment is so important, whether this is due taking the burden off your liver/kidneys or due to the relationship between hormones and candida, I really don't know. Probably both.

Ideally you'd live in a place with hardwood floors/newer windows.  
Things to be mindful of: Mold, carpet and old carpet (you have no idea what you're breathing in when it comes to carpet), tap water (full of heavy metals and estrogen), cat litter (this was a huge one for me. Most cat litters are endocrine disruptors and get all over your apartment/housing), cooking with stainless steel, making sure your laundry detergent is a good brand without heavy metals (I shockingly was using one that contained heavy metals. Switched to sensitive skin by Arm and Hammer). Your environment will have a huge impact on how well you detox.

**2. Hormones**. I've seen a trend (but don't quote me on this) where many people who have SIBO/candida also have Estrogen dominance, which means you have lots of ""free"" estrogen, and this isn't detected by a normal blood panel. It is a urine test. I took Doctor's Data Hormone and urine metabolites test and it came back extremely high in free estrogen. It was SO high my body literally accumulated copper. This is a thing. I took a heavy metals test and my copper levels were off the charts. My horrible doctor put me on chelation therapy for copper toxicity and my kidneys almost failed. :) Urine turned bright orange and then brown. This is an ""adrenal issue"" and shouldn't be treated with chelation.

So back to my point, there are 3 main supplements that treat high estrogen: Calcium D-glucarate (CDG), DIM, Sulforaphane. My doctor prescribed me Sulforaphane which basically just gave me bad detox reactions without any benefit. I stopped after 2 months.

I did, however, take CDG and this helped immensely. It was the last part of neurological problems I had (for 8+ years) being resolved, which included gait issues and brain fog/dizziness. I was also extremely emotional; constant state of worrying / panicked. These issues never came back after taking CDG. Although I think estrogen dominance is caused by a mix of your environment / candida / and supplementing isn't the only thing you need to do to treat it, I believe CDG helped open up my detox pathways.

It's important to note I felt GREAT on CDG. Stop forcing supplements on yourself that feel horrible. Sulforaphane and DIM gave me mixed reactions, and I didn't feel better once I stopped taking them.

**3. Coffee** gets metabolized through your liver. You are putting so much more strain on your detox pathways by drinking coffee. I didn't give up coffee the other 2 times I treated candida and that was stupid. I drink green tea every day though :) 25mg caffeine per cup as opposed to 100mg (from coffee).

**4. Acupuncture!!!**

Wow, I regret not incorporating acupuncture sooner. It was always too expensive until I realized community acupuncture is a thing. These are spots that are just as effective as solo treatment, but for a fraction of the price. Usually they charge a sliding scale between $25-$60. I'm fortunate that the place I go to is on the low end of $25.

Good for: Insomnia, opening detox pathways, digestion and motility.

After being bedridden the last 7+ months or so from antibiotics, antifungals, chelation therapy, etc. I was in BAD shape. Literally force feeding myself 800 calories a day, could hardly breathe, was completely lost, had no idea what to do.

Started going to acupuncture and within 2 sessions my appetite and energy came back. Like, I went straight to working out, it was insane. Cured my insomnia. Didn't cure all of my sleeping problems, more on that.  
Felt like a person again. If you've beaten your body down with any kind of supplement, please try acupuncture.

After taking antibiotics for SIBO again, and then starting Nystatin, I had full on constipation. Couldn't go to the bathroom for 2 days. Went again to acupuncture and now I am going twice a day (while on Nystatin). Important to mention that regardless of my bowel movements, I wasn't having die off from Nystatin. I did go to acupuncture several times before starting Nystatin and asked them to work on my detox pathways, insomnia, energy. Is this why I'm having such an easy time on Nystatin? Or is it that and everything else? I have no idea.

**5. Sleep**. Sleep is crazy important for detox. I am someone who's had insomnia and extreme body pain while sleeping.

Acupuncture cured my insomnia but has not helped with my body pain. I have to eat beets every day (like literally one beet) so that my body isn't in pain while I'm sleeping. I have no idea why. My guess is that your kidneys filter everything while you sleep and beets help your kidneys do this.

Will beets help you? I don't know. But if you wake up one day and had an amazing sleep, just know that it wasn't an accident. Be mindful of your good days and try to trace what you ate. It might be a solution to one of your problems.

Apologies for the quality, it's handwritten.

The text on on the whiteboard has words like ""inconclusive"", ""pi"", and ""2 = infinite"" written on them. The mushroom blueprint is labelling parts of it, the long label reads ""corrupted"", and the longer text reads ""unexplained void consumption"".  
I also have the words ""universe broken"" written in my notes, but I can't remember exactly where I found it.  
Oh, and the signs read ""power up"", and ""coffee"", and the sign above the coffee machine reads ""coffee area"".  
I haven't been able to read what's on any of the books or bottles yet.

The text that appears on the UI in the '?' fragments appears to be gibberish. I thought it may be a caesar cipher, but none of the samples I've found have 26 characters, and the closest one (at the top right) has duplicate characters, so I'm not entirely sure that would work.

After countless ""Unfortunately..."" emails (mostly on Sunday mornings, thanks ATS!), 600+ applications, ghosting from recruiters who were ""super excited"" about my profile, and 8+ months of grinding  thru  
\- finally landed two solid offers. \~5+ YOE in Canada here, looking for some insights.   
The job search has been brutal. Between getting rejected for being ""overqualified"" and ""not having exact match experience"", watching positions get cancelled mid-interview, and dealing with recruiters who disappear faster than my coffee in the morning - these two companies actually followed through.  
  
  
Offer 1 -  Mid level enterprise  Video streaming equipment manufacturer based in Ottawa:

Current goal is to transition into FAANG/MAANG in the future. Which role would better position me for that? Also considering potential recession/AI impacts on job security.  
  
Main concerns:

1. Is the 5k salary difference + better benefits worth the commute/car expense at Ross?
2. Which tech stack/domain would be more valuable for FAANG prep?
3. How recession-proof are these roles/companies?
4. Will manufacturing tech experience translate well to FAANG compared to FinTech?
5. Should commute time be a deal-breaker given current market conditions?

After this draining job search, I don't want to make the wrong choice. Really appreciate any insights from folks who've made similar decisions or transitioned to FAANG.

I 27F am struggling. My partner 27M isn’t helping. I love my partner more than anything in the world, we have been together for over 7 years. I would do anything for him. I struggle with a severe mental health condition which can affect my moods from being extremely high to low. Recently I have been very depressed and stressed with many things going on. I tell my partner all the time the ways I can be supported, what isn’t working in our relationship. For starters, I do everything in our home from cooking, cleaning, washing, meal prep etc. I plan all our holidays and a lot of our dates. When I go to the shop, I tend to think of my partner and buy him something like his favourite soda. 

I have asked for help and I am just not getting it at all. Today, I made us breakfast, coffee, lunch and dinner. I also sorted another issue today through various emails in relation to a property we are buying together. I felt extremely burnt out and lashed out over something silly and apologised. Then after dinner when my partner went to grab himself a snack (not asking if I want anything) I went to the kitchen to make myself a hot chocolate. Instead of asking do you want to sit down I can do that for you, he proceeded to ask for a hot chocolate which I agreed to. Due to being exhausted, I spilt my hot chocolate everywhere and had another meltdown which made me feel awful.

However whilst I blame myself for my poor reactions to these things, I was upset with my partner who knew I was burnt out and instead of making his own drink (never mind even making mine..) was happy to sit with his feet up playing games whilst I was doing another thing.

I’m tired of feeling like an awful person. I struggle witg my emotions and sometimes I don’t react well to things, that makes me feel intensely guilty for days. Again I feel guilty at my reaction. But I also recognise that I am just tired. I’m tired of doing everything for someone who does nothing for me. I always get the excuse of “I’m used to being told what to do otherwise I don’t do it” or “I’m not good at planning things” “I’m not good at cooking” etc. whilst I believe he loves me, I believe if he loved me enough he would WANT to do those things for me.

(To add we both work full time both pay 50/50 on everything)

I don’t know what to do anymore. For years I’ve expressed my feelings. I’m not perfect I don’t react well to things, I’m bossy etc. but I really try to show up everyday. I can’t bare the thought of losing him and a life without him really wouldn’t be worth living but I’ve spoken to him so many times about this and nothing ever changes. Has anyone got advice on overcoming a situation like this? I am starting to really resent him, feeling a lot of anger and less in love. I also don’t like the person the situation is making me become.",1,1743630626.0,relationships,0,1.0,False

Recently I've been drinking mate as a replacement of coffee for health reasons. I buy the real stuff from an Argentine shop, I got my calabaza, my bombilla and several kilos of yerba mate and I'm loving it. 

But I don't know how to keep it clean to be honest. I just pour hot water on the yerba all day (I don't even drink water anymore) and if I stop I just leave the cup on the shelf, I don't wash it, I just leave it with the wet mate and everything until I crave drinking again, usually the next day.

I don't wash the calabaza because I don't want to clog the dishwasher with yerba leftovers, I just use the bombilla to scrape the bottom and I add more fresh yerba.

But now the exterior part of the calabaza is turning black and I'm worried of what I may be ingesting. Am I fucking up? How am I supposed to keep it clean? ",4,1743630481.0,argentina,12,1.0,False

We love everything outdoors: skiing, mountain biking, fly fishing, backpacking/hiking, etc. I know Salem is by no means a hub of any of those things, but close enough that we could still do all of those things weekly (weather permitting). 

Living in a neighborhood with social options is important to us. Walkable/bikeable areas with restaurants and coffee shops are definitely something we are looking for. We’re not big nightlife folks so that’s not a huge concern. 

I grew up in the Midwest and with old neighborhoods filled with trees and craftsman homes, which Salem seems to have a lot of. My cursory internet search of Salem reminds me a lot of the neighborhood I grew up in.

1jq0ptj,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1jq0ptj/when_ive_starting_to_learn_about_the_existance_of/,When I've starting to learn about the existance of 'limerence',"Not sure which tag I would be using here, I guess I discovered something and wanted to share and also wanted to vent a bit and ask for support.

I've turned my life around after being my lesserself for some time, hitting the gym find some more time for hobbies and starting heading outside more, interacting with people, opening up and starting conversations, some might even call it casual flirting with some. I definitely got more attention overal from women, like they feel I'm more ""attractive"" or approachable in some way.

It came with a downside as well, developing a crush on a coworker which I interacted with before but somehow I fet attracted to her more and more. Unwanted because I want to focus on work at work and build out my personal life and keep both separated.

I definitely felt we got attraction and first thought it was friendly but later I felt it getting more than just friendly, at least from my side. I noticed she also kept asking more personal questions, which I answered high level not to going tofar over my boundaries.

I went looking on internet what was going on and how I could deal with this, if it was really a crush or my mind tricking me into something that's not there, because I don't want it to develop because of risk for my job.

While searching I found 'limerence' and looked deeper into this. I found below stages from an article and I seem to be heading into stage 3, reality.

I found myself distancing from the person and trying to avoid interaction to not feel awkward around her and focus on work, because I don't want to feel this way but still be respectful to the person in question.

I guess it all have to happen when I started opening more up to people and be more talkative and I end with myself getting hurt being obsessed by someone I know I cannot be with.

Coming back on the first sentence, I guess I just wanted to vent a bit, getting stuff out of my mind and wondering if what I'm going through is normal. I would appriciate any support.

Article:

Stage 1) Infatuation: much like how we would with a crush, this stage is where we become increasingly curious about our person. We tend to think about them a lot, trivial or not: how do they like their coffee in the morning? do they even like coffee?

Stage 2) Crystallization: this is where we begin our journey out of “crush” and into the tell-tale sign of limerence. At this stage, our person could not be any more than perfect in our eyes, it’s the proverbial “rose-colored glasses” to the equally well-known “love is blind”. You feel that this person is your soulmate. You’re now teetering between cute curiosity and all-consuming love. However, as you ride these blissful feelings off into the quickly setting sun, the fear of rejection rears its ugly head. What if your person doesn’t feel the same way? those “rose-colored glasses” begin to shatter. Leading us to stage…

3) Deterioration aka the reality. This is where you hit rock bottom and realize, and ultimately accept, that the intense feelings you have for your person are unrequited. There is now an immense sense of loss.",3,1743630105.0,dating,1,1.0,False

I find her nice but annoying, though I'm happy to grab coffee and catch up annually when she visits my city (her brother lives here). The dynamic is a bit awkward... she refers to me as her best friend, while I consider her ""an old friend from college"". I don't want to hurt her — she is extremely sensitive. And I don't really have a ""reason"" to formally break off the friendship. I just find her irksome in general. That sounds terrible but it's the truth. 

She texts often (usually memes about a sport we played in college that neither of us participate in anymore) and I rarely respond. Yesterday she texted and asked how my job was going (last time I saw her I mentioned I was struggling with a new position at work). We chatted for a few minutes and I mentioned a work trip I had coming up next month in Seattle. She said she'd always wanted to visit Seattle, and I was like ""yeah me too but I'm not really excited for the trip, I'll be traveling alone so it's not like I will be checking out a bunch of cool bars/restaurants by myself.""

The next day, she texts me a screenshot of a flight itinerary, with the caption ""SURPRISE""! She booked a trip to Seattle for the same weekend as my work trip. She even booked a room at my same hotel (she had asked where I was staying in our convo and I didn't think anything of it.) She said ""now you have someone to explore Seattle with!""

I specifically said I didn't have that much work to do on this trip and that I'd mostly be hanging around the city alone, so I can't exactly say I'm now too busy to spend the whole weekend with her. But the imbalance in our relationship makes me deeply uncomfortable, and I am dreading spending 72 hours with her. Also, the one thing I was really looking forward to about this trip was getting to do some hiking (which I love). She has a disability and is unable to hike, but now I feel bad about going off without her. 

Is there any way to get out of this without hurting her? And is there a way to dial back this friendship in a clearer way since she doesn't seem to be phased by my meager responses when she reaches out? She is single and doesn't have a lot of friends so I wouldn't be leaving her with a great support system, and she has a history of depression. So I just don't want to break her heart.

As you’re most probably used to by now, this is just my initial warning that what follows is my ranting and rambling about both Steam Deck-specific(ish) news, and general gaming news I’ve spotted and seems interesting to me.

This time around though, if you’ll indulge me I might highlight some of *my* favorite people? Alongside news that is, of course.

Grab a cup of coffee, settle in and poke holes in my mistakes and formatting (or, idk, just enjoy this)!

# What have you been playing?

This one’s just…me asking some of my friends what they’ve been playing and enjoying lately on Steam Deck or otherwise. You’ll maybe recognize some of them, so if you’ll indulge me:

This is…a bit of ‘fluff’ I know, but at least to *me* it’s interesting to see what the people behind the channels, sites and programs you love are playing. Sadly lots who answer tell me that there’s little time to actually *play* the games, but also that the coding itself can become a game to them. Anyway, thought you might be interested in these!

# GOG + Control

Easily one of my favorite games of the last few years: Control: Ultimate Edition has a new significant update:

https://preview.redd.it/ff9s7omgnwre1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=4397b7e4bb08013f11ca3e18ab6cb3ca65d8f37a

[https://controlgame.com/control-march-2025-update-notes-pc/](https://controlgame.com/control-march-2025-update-notes-pc/)

But…as per usual, GOG users do not get the update at the same time as other platforms like Steam and EpicGames do.

And…sad to say, if at all. No word yet on the ‘when’. GOG has a reputation for being ‘second-class citizens’ with updates from publishers.

[There is a thread on GOG’s forum showing *just* how second-class GOG users can be treated - with updates being either delayed or never released on the platform. Again, this is *not* GOG’s doing, but those responsible for the games. Here’s a link to the latest page on that thread here](https://www.gog.com/forum/general/games_that_treat_gog_customers_as_second_class_citizens_v2)

Despite this, I am 𝘴𝘰 excited to revisit one of my fav games on SteamDeck!!

Fingers crossed this update once it hits GOG will sort out one *very* annoying program, the propensity for the game to crash with the Anchor boss. It’s been known and complained about for an eternity here, but we can hope!

(actually, ironically there *is* a way to pass that as it stands, in the least polished way possible:

https://preview.redd.it/863yul6jnwre1.png?width=729&format=png&auto=webp&s=197ee25e618ea5bc2ba3fefdf34dbbd1a835832c

# Notable GOG games updates:

There’s some recent updates (since we’ve last spoken), which will be the least interesting thing possible to read, *but* I somehow find it very fun to share.

I like to keep track what I have installed, and what I think there’s a good chance others may also, and note their updates. The following is also an embedded link to their GOG store page:

# Square Enix staff + a old game cache:

“Members of Square Enix recently made a remarkable discovery upon opening an old storage container at work that had been shut for close to 20 years: a cache of pristine, retro games that includes titles released for the Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, Atari ST, DOS computers, N-Gage, Nintendo Wii, and Amstrad CPC, among other platforms.”

[I literally ripped that paragraph from their article, the full thing is here but…that’s basically the best of it!](https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/03/square-enix-staff-discover-cache-of-pristine-retro-games-some-of-which-date-back-30-years)

This following link is better though, since you get a video of them showing off what is there:

[And this is the link (a LinkedIn link](https://www.linkedin.com/videos/urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7300476318897299456/?origin=NETWORK_CONVERSATIONS&midToken=AQF9-aVL-zJfMQ&midSig=14EOp9FfuOPXE1&eid=6xpei-m7wbhztd-b6&otpToken=MTMwNDE4ZTUxMjJjY2ZjMmJlMmYwMmVlNDcxY2U3YjA4NmM5ZDU0MTliYWU4NTZhNzNjNzAyNmY0NzVhNWFmN2ZjZDFiZjk0NDRiMmM4ZGQ3ZTBiODliY2JkOGU5NjI4ODEyMjkyMDI2NjQ0YTdmY2U3LDEsMQ%3D%3D)

Got a update specific to the Steam Deck (always lovely to see!) which made the download size smaller than before. Another few fixes are included, but to me this is the focus, going from 144.2GB to 88.1GB (phew, at least it’s not at God of War: Ragnarok’s 177GB -\_-)

# Path of Exile 2:

https://preview.redd.it/2jbn5ibtnwre1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=878d79c20f86a19f1af464760e4b0b6e1d9e1042

An update was also seen for this one recently:

* [*Fixed Steam Deck and other Linux Wine-based clients being incorrectly warned for modifying the client.*](https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3732353)

Nice to see Grinding Gear Games is supporting Steam Deck, but…it still looks awful *on* said Steam Deck, so…that didn’t change I guess

# Maxima:

https://preview.redd.it/ahjyt14unwre1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f27fcee1d24f3630966f17275f5efd66709bb86

This is just a…brief teaser for something you can’t see yet. Maxima is on its way, being a replacement for EA’s Origin launcher, made so you can skip using it and just enjoy the games yourself.

One of the devs has shared this link for the GitHub, but it’s one to keep an eye on and not *live* yet:

[https://github.com/ArmchairDevelopers/Maxima/](https://github.com/ArmchairDevelopers/Maxima/)

“Maxima - It’s the farthest you can get from the Origin”

Yay!

# XenonRecomp - the 360 games tool

This one might be of interest to the more technical-minded (which, on Lemmy…seems to be everyone?) but here’s the ‘about’ (and follow it the GitHub)

\*XenonRecomp is a tool that converts Xbox 360 executables into C++ code, which can then be recompiled for any platform. Currently, it only supports x86 platforms due to the use of x86 intrinsics.

This project was heavily inspired by [N64: Recompiled](https://github.com/N64Recomp/N64Recomp), a similar tool for N64 executables.\*

[And the link to the GitHub for it is here!](https://github.com/hedge-dev/XenonRecomp)

# Acclaim Entertainment:

https://preview.redd.it/863qlo3vnwre1.png?width=970&format=png&auto=webp&s=2aa2177eb5928562d61ce2bc089dc434a36f91bf

Acclaim has been ‘reborn’ as a new kind of publisher. They’re now focusing on retro games titles. Reviving classic franchises specifically

[The link to a article about the announcement is here!](https://venturebeat.com/games/acclaim-entertainment-reborn-as-indie-game-publisher-focused-on-original-ip/)

# Ubisoft execs on trial:

No better time to boycott Ubisoft, if you’re not already, as former Ubisoft bosses go on trial in France over alleged harassment.

\*\*\*Thomas François is alleged to have habitually watched pornographic films in the open-plan office and commented on the appearance of female employees, whom he routinely insulted.

François is being prosecuted for an attempted sexual assault when he tried to forcibly kiss a young employee during a Christmas party as she was held by other colleagues.\*\*\*

[Full article here, which is a sobering view of what people have to deal with, and how disgusting people in power can be over others](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/police-and-justice/article/2025/03/10/former-ubisoft-bosses-on-trial-in-france-over-alleged-harassment_6738996_105.html)

# The Ori Series:

The two Ori games have now sold over more than 15 million copies!!!

“Not too shabby for a Metrodvania and a genre we were told is dead when we started to work on it!”

# Selaco + testers:

https://preview.redd.it/91euu03xnwre1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d6765447f19002e44b62213213e60854090d031

One of my fav efforts of programming in a game in recent times has been Selaco which was made using the GZDoom engine. The way they made that game look on that engine is absolute magic.

A kind of beautiful mix of modern style, and the obvious (now I learn is called ‘boomer shooters’) retro game-play mechanics - and I tell everyone I know to play it!

[The launch trailer, which was 9 months ago, is here, I recommend you all watch it if you don’t already know Selaco!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFI1QSd4T2g)

The developers are currently getting an engine upgrade: *𝘎𝘡𝘋𝘰𝘰𝘮 𝟦.𝟣𝟥; 𝘳𝘰𝘶𝘨𝘩𝘭𝘺 𝘧𝘪𝘷𝘦 𝘺𝘦𝘢𝘳𝘴 𝘸𝘰𝘳𝘵𝘩 𝘰𝘧 𝘪𝘮𝘱𝘳𝘰𝘷𝘦𝘮𝘦𝘯𝘵𝘴*

# Death Stranding 2

You’ve no doubt seen the (in true Kojima style!) 20875073456045 hours long trailer which just came out for the game, but most fun for me was seeing this post by Kojima on Bluesky sharing some of the merch:

There’s a server my friend Gardiner Bryant started only a few days ago. You’ll find it’s small, with few people there, but we’re all rather lovely (if I do say so myself). All of the names from the beginning are some of the users in this server, if you want to drop by and say anything. But otherwise it deals with:

* Steam Deck
* Linux
* Gaming
* General chat

If you’d like to join us, then the link is here:

Yes, it *is* on Revolt. There is two options available for Android users, the official one and a community-built one. Neither of which I’ve even tried yet, I just access it via the website!

## Key Features Analysis

The ⁣quality and ⁣effectiveness of a ⁤3d printed sign depend on⁣ several key features. Understanding these features will help you choose ⁤the best option for your business needs.

**Material Durability:** The material used in 3d printing​ is paramount for ensuring ‌the longevity and resilience of the sign. Petg plastic is a‍ common‍ material renowned for its strength, impact resistance, and weatherability, making it suitable for both‍ indoor ⁢and outdoor applications. Abs plastic also offers good strength and is frequently enough used when⁣ higher temperature resistance is required. Pla plastic is another option, favoured for its biodegradability, but may be best suited for indoor use due to its lower resistance to moisture and uv exposure.

The choice of material⁤ directly impacts the signs lifespan and⁢ ability to withstand environmental‍ factors. understanding the surroundings where the sign will be placed is import when making a ⁤material choice.

**Print Resolution and Detail:** Print resolution determines the level of detail that can be achieved in the sign's design. Higher resolution printing allows for intricate ‍details,‍ sharper edges, and smoother ‌surfaces resulting‌ in a more professional and visually appealing finished product. ​Low resolutions can lead to noticeable layer lines, rough textures, and reduced clarity ​of fine details.

For complex logos, intricate patterns, ​or photorealistic images, a high-resolution print ⁤is crucial to accurately ‌capture the intended design. Resolution ⁣is measured in microns, with lower micron numbers representing higher resolution.

**Color Options and Customization:** 3d printing offers a wide range of color options,allowing for vibrant and accurate depiction of your brand's colors. Multi-color printing capabilities further enhance customization options, enabling intricate designs and gradients directly within ⁤the sign. Some 3d printing services⁤ also offer post-processing options​ such as painting, coating, and surface finishing, allowing for even greater customization and aesthetic appeal.

Beyond standard colors, many suppliers can match specific pantone colors or create custom blends to ensure ‍a perfect match with your brand⁢ guidelines.

**Size and Dimensionality:** 3d printing allows for the creation of signs in a wide range ⁣of sizes and shapes. From small nameplates to large storefront logos, 3d printing can‍ accommodate virtually any⁣ dimensional requirement. The ability to create complex 3d shapes and textures adds another layer of visual interest and allows for unique‌ and eye-catching designs.

Larger signs may be printed in multiple sections⁤ and then assembled, allowing‍ for the creation of sizable displays without exceeding the limitations of the 3d printer's build⁢ volume.

**Mounting Options and Hardware:** The⁢ ease and security of mounting are important considerations when choosing a 3d printed sign. various mounting options are available, including‌ adhesive ​backing, screw holes, standoffs, and hanging hardware. The chosen mounting method should be appropriate for the size, weight, and intended location of the sign.

Durable and weather-resistant hardware is ⁤especially important for outdoor signs to ensure they remain securely mounted and withstand ⁣the elements.

## Core benefits

3d printed signs ​offer a⁢ range of practical benefits​ that make ⁣them a compelling choice for businesses looking to enhance their brand visibility and customer experience.

Businesses can easily​ incorporate their logo, brand colors, and unique design ⁢elements into the sign, ensuring a consistent ⁤brand message.Personalized nameplates,directional signs,and promotional displays can be created​ to meet specific needs and enhance the customer experience. A law firm might use 3d printed nameplates with individual employee names and‍ titles to project a ‍professional and personalized ⁤image.

**Durability and Longevity:** 3d printed signs made from durable materials like petg or abs plastic offer excellent resistance to weather, uv exposure, and impact. This ensures that the sign‌ maintains its appearance⁤ and functionality over time, even ⁣in‌ harsh environments. Compared to traditional signs made from wood ⁤or acrylic, 3d printed signs resist warping, cracking,⁣ and fading, resulting​ in a longer lifespan and ⁣reduced maintenance costs. ​A retail store might use 3d printed signs for its outdoor displays to withstand sun, rain, and wind ensuring a consistent visual impact.**Cost-Effectiveness:** While the initial cost of 3d printed signs may be slightly ‍higher than some traditional options, the long-term cost-effectiveness is often notable. The durability and longevity of 3d printed signs reduce the need for frequent replacements or repairs, ⁤resulting in‍ lower overall costs.⁤ Additionally, the ease‍ of customization allows businesses to⁢ create signs that perfectly match their needs without incurring additional fees for design changes or custom fabrication. A restaurant can benefit from the cost-effectiveness of 3d printed signs by updating promotional displays‌ frequently without incurring high printing costs.

I'm in a predicament that I usually find myself in 2 or 3 times a year. I've a lecture to prepare for this week and next week to be given to a room of curious trainees and experts. One of the types where you present new findings in your field and then critique the studies and methods followed by the worst part: the 5-10 minutes of questions at the end from all the experts in the room.

It's a positive environment and I value their questions and comments, but it just puts me on edge, understandably.

So, I came here looking for someone to put a little dopamine into my reward center - it'd be nice to have a bit of a distraction and get to know a new friend while I chip away at this lecture. What am I looking for? Comfy vibes, like sitting with a friend at a nice cafe while that one song by Nora Jones plays in the background and not too loudly - I don't even like that song much, but it is nice. Jokes, banter, rants - everything is invited.

I find things begin best with a question a lot of times, so here's a few for you to pick from:

1. How would you describe your perfect meal?
2. How do you take your coffee? If you don't like coffee, what beverage can I grab for you?
3. Do you think some animals do know how to talk and communicate with us, they've just chosen not to? Maybe because they want to avoid paying taxes or something.

If you've made it this far, here's a little more about me:  
I'm Jay, 30, from Texas. I work as a physician (fun fact: lecture as mentioned above is going to be to a room full of other physicians who are also evaluating me). My dream job was to be an astronaut, I love aviation and space, I think I could find something cute about any animal, and overall I think laughing your way through most situations is an ideal strategy.

I look forward to hearing from ya.

It's a unique chance to hike with your family and friends while supporting our community.

I've worked at The Center for 7 of the 11 years I've worked in homeless services, and I think this agency is special because we focus on creating a supportive, joyful, safe community where folks feel valued and seen. By fostering belonging, we’ve achieved higher-than-average housing retention rates. Social connection is as essential as food, water, and shelter. When people are embedded in caring communities, they stay healthy and housed.

I know that a lot of Angelenos aren’t too impressed with homeless services providers right now, but I am here to (try) to answer any questions you might have about the homeless services provider landscape.

 Here's what you can expect at The Hike:

* **Tickets start at $35**
* **7:30 AM Check-in starts**
* **Line-dancing hike warm-up** (Failed to mention it's a Western-themed hike!)
* **Coffee and light breakfast** before the hike, and **lunch** afterward (included in ticket).
* **Hike starts at 9:20 after a brief rally**
* **Ponies** and a **hygiene kit building station** for non-hikers to enjoy.
* We'll start at the **Boy Scout Trailhead** and end at the **Griffith Observatory**—a moderate hike. For those looking for more of a challenge, you can opt to hike to **Dante's View** afterward.

However, the biggest gripe with the bellman is that it takes too long and it's hard to get a consistent (and enough) steam by the time you're ready for it.

I wanted to share a my workflow, and how I'm able to steam milk while the 9Barista is working and am able to make a latte, cappuccino consistently in about 6 minutes.

The biggest thing is to put jusy one inch of water in the bellman, and then put it on an appropriately sized hob. For me, it's the smallest one since the next size up goes to the 9bar. I use a diffuser plate to keep the handle from getting too hot.

Then, I weigh the coffee and prepare the 9bar, and set it on the appropriate hob, with diffuser plate. 

In about 3 minutes, there will be enough steam. I fill my milk cup, and leave the bellman on the stove and the stove on high. And I steam the milk. Afterwards, I immediately put it under cold water. By the point the 9bar is almost done, or just beginning to brew. 

It's really pretty easy, and I'm surprised that the bellman directions say to fill it up to the handle(about half way). It takes so impractically long and its really just a waste of energy. 1 inch of water or less, and it's super fast. I do it 3 or 4 days before I fill it back up, and even then it still has plenty of water left, I just change it out anyway.

So, that's it. Cappuccino every day, adds no time to the process since you're waiting for the 9bar anyway.",2,1743629097.0,9Barista,1,1.0,False

I'm writing because I need advice about my relationship. I'm 22 years old, and my boyfriend is 25. We've been together for two years, and in the beginning, our relationship was perfect—he was loving, caring, and gentle, just the kind of partner I had always dreamed of. But a month ago, everything changed because of his actions.

I knew he had struggled with gambling in the past. We had even gone to a casino together a few times. A year ago, he promised me he would completely stop gambling. At first, I kept asking him how he was doing, and he reassured me that he wasn’t gambling anymore. I believed him and completely forgot about it—until a month ago when I accidentally found long blonde hairs on his jacket. At first, I thought they might belong to my roommate since they looked identical, but as I kept finding more throughout the day, I became more and more suspicious.

When I confronted him about my doubts, he suddenly said, *""You can ask T (his friend); we were together at a bar last night.""* This statement seemed suspicious, so when he fell asleep, I checked his phone. I found a message he had sent to T: *""If anyone asks, we were at the bar last night.""* My heart started racing so fast that it woke him up, and I didn’t have time to check the rest of his phone. When he saw what I had read, he immediately started convincing me that it wasn’t about another girl but about the casino. At that moment, I didn’t care anymore—I told him to leave.

The next day, I demanded the full truth. He admitted that, over the past year, he had lost around €2,000 in physical casinos and at least €4,000 in online gambling. For context: he has a very high salary, yet he had been borrowing money from me almost every month—money I now knew was for gambling. I gave him an ultimatum: he had to stop gambling completely, find a therapist and attend sessions regularly, and allow me full access to his phone and location.

This past month has been extremely difficult for our relationship. The trust is gone, and our bond is damaged. I constantly had to remind him to find a therapist—he finally went once, didn’t like it, and quit.

Yesterday was our two-year anniversary. We planned to have a picnic at the place where we had our first date. I had prepared three gifts for him, and he knew about them. One of them was even an early birthday gift since his birthday is next week—things I knew he needed and would appreciate. And he got me… nothing. Not even a single flower. I couldn’t believe it. The whole evening, we sat in silence while I cried. That night, we slept facing opposite directions. He kept apologizing, but his apologies felt exactly like the ones my ex used to make when he cheated on me.

Today, we met for coffee, and I wanted to go through his phone. I found recent transactions on Revolut. He claimed they were for a game, but it turned out to be for opening loot boxes in CS:GO, which is essentially a form of gambling. In the past two days, he had spent €200 on this, yet he couldn’t even buy me a small bouquet of flowers for our anniversary.

I decided to take a break—not because I don’t want to be with him, but because I need him to realize what life is like without me. When I told him this, he claimed that he had planned a spa weekend for us. But I don’t believe him—if that were true, he would have told me yesterday when I asked if he really had nothing for me.

My therapist has offered to have a session with both of us next week. That would be our first meeting after the break—if I can hold out until then.

I don’t know if taking a break is the right decision or if I should approach this differently. What should I do?",7,1743628712.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,4,1.0,False

He is still friends with his most recent ex. They broke up only two months before him and I got together. There is a very long and complicated back story to this, but to summarize: there were definitely times where he was seeing both of us without either one of us knowing. He had his reasons for doing so which I partially understand, but I still feel like cheating is never okay. So it's fair to say that I have some trust issues due to his past behaviour (even though -to my knowledge- he never cheated on me, just on her with me which I did not know I was participating in back then). I've always felt uneasy about them being friends still, which I only found out about a couple months into the relationship. We talked about it many times and I cried and got emotional about it alot too, telling him I felt like she was more important to him than me, and he explained to me that he just really likes her as a person but that it just doesn't work between the two of them relationship wise. During their relationship her mother died tragically and they basically went through hell together. When he broke up with her he promised her that she could still always call him when she wasn't doing well. This also happened a few times during our relationship and he was always super worried about her and met up with her to try to make her feel better. He swears that he has no romantic feelings for her anymore. But to me it just doesn't seem like it's just a friendship. I met her two or three times at parties and talked to her. She is generally a nice person but I got the strong impression that she is slightly manipulative and still has feelings for him and her behaviour towards him seems posessvive to me. In addition my boyfriend even admits that it would be weird for the three of us to hang out together which is why I only ever met her in group settings. He sometimes meets her for lunch / coffee just the two of them and they regularly text and sometimes talk on the phone. Whenever she is mentioned I just get incredibly angry and sad at the same time. For his birthday and christmas (he was not doing well mentally at that time) she wrote him heartfelt cards saying that she will always be there for him and gave presents with emotional meaning. Until recently he had a huge painting hanging in his living room that she has painted. She's just still so incredibly present in his life. There are many other instances that felt inappropriate to me but I don't want this to get too long. 
It just feels wrong to me that he has such a strong emotional connection to another woman, especially one that he was intimate with. I'm not a generally jealous person. He has other female friends too and I am fine with that, even including a female best friend that he had sex with years ago and not even her I'm bothered by. It's just the ex girlfriend. His ""friendship"" with her feels just as bad as cheating to me. I am slowly getting to a point where I feel like I have to end the relationship if he's not willing to cut contact with her entirely. But I'm also scared of him just keeping in touch with her behind my back and hiding things from me. Should the fact that this is causing me so much emotional distress not make him want to change something? After all I am his actual  girlfriend and should be his priority, shouldn't I? Or AITA and should me more understanding? ",2,1743628277.0,AITA_Relationships,10,1.0,False
1jpzyiy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jpzyiy,Tx Plan: Fungus Gnats in Money Tree (help please!),"I am so stressed out about these fungus gnats and want to come up with a plan of action - I know this comes up a lot, so this is what I’ve collected over multiple posts on this subreddit: 
1. Use mosquito dunks/bits 
2. Use mosquito dunks/bits as a tea (longer steeping than directed on bit bag) + only do ground watering 
3. Sticky paper to capture adult gnats (pictured) 
4. Hydrogen peroxide/water mixture 
5. Water less frequently 
6. Cover soil with sand to suffocate larvae 
7. Cover soil AND groundwater holes with coffee filters OR dryer sheets, to stop them entering from the bottom 
8. Cover soil with diatomaceous earth, to slice them as they pass through (?) OR cinnamon 
9. Introduce predators, such as nematodes or spiders 
10. Take the plant out and clean out the roots 
11. Neem oil
12. ????


So far, I’ve tried the bits (as directed, not as a multi day steeped tea), neem oil, and fly paper - this has worked with the majority of the plants, but not the Money Tree which has intense sentimental value to me (you know how it is!). My guess is that I always over watered the money tree (groundwater method, every 2 weeks) but it’s never really been a problem til now. Though I always ground watered it, I recently repotted and top watered with the dunk/bit formula. 

As pictured, I’m worried about the soil quality in general as I noticed little mushrooms (all dying) coming from the bottom groundwater holes. This is disheartening and confusing to me, as the plant itself seems to be flourishing (for now??). 

Unique case history: 
This tree is about 8 years old and has been repotted by me about 3-4 times. I have stuck to the care instructions I was given (groundwater soak every other week) when it was gifted to me. About 2 months ago, my partner brought a plant in from Home Depot (plant now deceased) which had a horrible gnat infestation and root rot, effecting all the other plants. This plant was around when I repotted the money tree… :( :( :( 

For my treatment plan, I am considering a stepped method:
1. Dry out and otherwise return to only groundwater, using bits tea and neem oil 
2. Hydrogen peroxide/water mixture to treat whatever is going on in the soil leading to mushrooms (!!!!) 
3. Continue use of fly paper, but also cover drain holes (but will this make the mushroom situation worse?)

Escalation (if necessary): 
4. Take out and lightly clean roots before reporting 
5. Once repotted, cover with diatomaceous earth to take out any that move around 
6. Then put a layer of clear sand (?) over the diatomaceous earth so that they can’t pass o it of the soil 
7. Continue all other treatments (bit tea, fly paper) til it’s all gone. 


—- 
What do you all think? Any advice? I am so so worried about this because I love plants but have very little experience with them. I also really want to avoid buying any parasites, like the nematodes.

The upgrade doesn’t have an on off switch per se, other than plugging and unplugging the batteries (12v in series with 6v).

Being the tinkerer that I am I figured maybe I could reuse the on/off switch I saved from on old coffee maker, mount it in dashboard of ride-on you, and use it as the “ignition”. Fun part is the switch I have has an LED indicator for on.

I can get the switch to operate as on/off no problem, but can’t get the LED indicator to turn on.

How should I wire this or won’t it work because it’s only 18v DC versus 110/120 AC? I put the switch inline with main + line from batteries.

I'm writing because I need advice about my relationship. I'm 22 years old, and my boyfriend is 25. We've been together for two years, and in the beginning, our relationship was perfect—he was loving, caring, and gentle, just the kind of partner I had always dreamed of. But a month ago, everything changed because of his actions.

I knew he had struggled with gambling in the past. We had even gone to a casino together a few times. A year ago, he promised me he would completely stop gambling. At first, I kept asking him how he was doing, and he reassured me that he wasn’t gambling anymore. I believed him and completely forgot about it—until a month ago when I accidentally found long blonde hairs on his jacket. At first, I thought they might belong to my roommate since they looked identical, but as I kept finding more throughout the day, I became more and more suspicious.

When I confronted him about my doubts, he suddenly said, *""You can ask T (his friend); we were together at a bar last night.""* This statement seemed suspicious, so when he fell asleep, I checked his phone. I found a message he had sent to T: *""If anyone asks, we were at the bar last night.""* My heart started racing so fast that it woke him up, and I didn’t have time to check the rest of his phone. When he saw what I had read, he immediately started convincing me that it wasn’t about another girl but about the casino. At that moment, I didn’t care anymore—I told him to leave.

The next day, I demanded the full truth. He admitted that, over the past year, he had lost around €2,000 in physical casinos and at least €4,000 in online gambling. For context: he has a very high salary, yet he had been borrowing money from me almost every month—money I now knew was for gambling. I gave him an ultimatum: he had to stop gambling completely, find a therapist and attend sessions regularly, and allow me full access to his phone and location.

This past month has been extremely difficult for our relationship. The trust is gone, and our bond is damaged. I constantly had to remind him to find a therapist—he finally went once, didn’t like it, and quit.

Yesterday was our two-year anniversary. We planned to have a picnic at the place where we had our first date. I had prepared three gifts for him, and he knew about them. One of them was even an early birthday gift since his birthday is next week—things I knew he needed and would appreciate. And he got me… nothing. Not even a single flower. I couldn’t believe it. The whole evening, we sat in silence while I cried. That night, we slept facing opposite directions. He kept apologizing, but his apologies felt exactly like the ones my ex used to make when he cheated on me.

Today, we met for coffee, and I wanted to go through his phone. I found recent transactions on Revolut. He claimed they were for a game, but it turned out to be for opening loot boxes in CS:GO, which is essentially a form of gambling. In the past two days, he had spent €200 on this, yet he couldn’t even buy me a small bouquet of flowers for our anniversary.

I decided to take a break—not because I don’t want to be with him, but because I need him to realize what life is like without me. When I told him this, he claimed that he had planned a spa weekend for us. But I don’t believe him—if that were true, he would have told me yesterday when I asked if he really had nothing for me.

My therapist has offered to have a session with both of us next week. That would be our first meeting after the break—if I can hold out until then.

I don’t know if taking a break is the right decision or if I should approach this differently. What should I do?",1,1743627715.0,Advice,3,1.0,False

I have been married for almost 2 years to my husband and we have a young toddler.

 Before we got married my husband would play a ton of videosgames but usually I wasn't around because he wouldn't play when we went on dates or if we were spending time together ect. At one point he wanted to be a streamer. I recently saw a post on Reddit from a woman and in the woman's post she said that her husband told her he appreciates that she lets him participate in his hobbies after they got married and that most wives don't let their husbands partake in their hobbies after marriage. 

I started to realize that I have asked my husband to cut back on video games and when he plays video games I complain. We came to an agreement in December that he would only play videogames 3-4 times a week for 2 hours uninterrupted and if he was interrupted he would pause the timer. At first I was okay with this but his game time would turn into 4 hours because the dog needed to be let out and I couldn't do it because I was busy with our toddler or I was in the middle of cooking. So he would have to pause the timer for 5-15 minutes to take the dog out to potty. This was kind of annoying but we had an agreement and I wanted him to still have time to play games. Over time I realized he was playing longer than we had agreed apon. Here and there an extra 30 minutes wouldn't bother me but it started to get in the way of our time together and or sometimes I needed help with our son. On top of this since this agreement sometimes our dog would potty on the floor because he was trying to finish a game. I also take the dog out especially if it's my husband's game time but the times the dog would potty on the floor I was usually in the bathroom using the potty, cooking and I couldn't walk away from the stove, or I was in the other room taking care of our toddler and the dog didn't come up to me and start doing his potty dance lol. I started to time his game time as well because sometimes it felt like he was on the game as soon as he got home from work and would play until it was time for bed or dinner. I would ask him if he only played for 2 hours like we agreed upon and he would say yes and that the dog kept bothering him. So, I decided to start timing his game time and made it a point to make sure he had no interruptions. I would make sure to cook something that I could easily walk away from to let the dog out and would make sure to keep a closer eye on our dog. When it would hit the 2 hour mark with no interruptions I could here his alarm go off on his phone and he would turn it off and keep playing (I don't expect him not to finish a game and just dip out in the middle of a game. I'm not a bitch and if I were him or his friends I would be pissed if my spouse didn't let me finish a game). I realized that if I was in the living room or the kitchen he would tell them ""this is the last game boys."" If I was in the bathroom or our room he would just keep playing after his alarm went off. For context we live in an apartment and our layout is pretty open. The kitchen, dinning area, and living room are all open. I can easily talk to my husband in the kitchen while he's in the living room. When I was in our room or the bathroom I would here him say stuff like ""wanna play another game"" or ""yeah, we can play another game"" after the timer went off. After about a week I realized he was playing for 3-4 hours a day (on days he wasn't interrupted at all) and sometimes he would try to add extra days because he was ""interrupted"" too much the last time he played. I started to get annoyed and I would complain about him playing too much and so now he hasn't really been playing video games and when I ask him if he wants to play he just tells me that he doesn't want to piss me off. He also hasn't stopped playing video games, apparently he plays at work if he has time. My husband is in the military and sometimes they literally just sit around doing nothing waiting to be released so he plays his video games if that happens.

The reason why I complain about his game time is because I'm a SAHM. I don't really have any hobbies and I can't find one that interests me that won't take a ton of time or practice. I don't have any friends to hang out with and its hard making friends when you are a SAHM. My best friend is in another country teaching abroad so I can't go hang out with him. My other friends either live 2 hours away or work 2-3 jobs and don't have time to hang out. So the only person I have to hang out with is my husband. I have tried making other mom friends on social media in mom groups around my area but usually we don't click, they ONLY want to talk about being a parent/their kids, and or they just want to do play dates. I want a friend I can go out to lunch with, get coffee or go out for a drink or 2 at brunch or at a bar, go shopping, and or go on walks with. I want him to have his game time but I also want to spend time with him. When he's at work I spend my day with our son playing with him, putting him down for naps, ect. When my husband comes home I finally get to have an adult to talk to and spend some time with even if it's while I cook or clean. My husband is an amazing father and husband. He helps clean the house and he cooks here and there (I prefer to cook). He is also a very hands on father! He puts our son down for bed when I need or want him to, he plays with our son, changes 70% of the diapers if he's home, ect. I just feel like he prefers to play games over spending time with me. Maybe I'm too needy. I don't know. I want him to be able to enjoy his hobby but I also want to spend as much time as I can with him because right now he's my only friend. Again, I have tried making friends but it's really really hard when 98% of the time I'm at home. The only time I leave the house is if I'm running errands, going to a doctor's appointment for me or my son, or going to my father's house for about an hour. Before I was married and had my son I would work, go to college, and I would go out with friends. Now most of my time is spent changing diapers, cleaning, cooking, doom scrolling social media, playing with my son, and watching TV. 

Please let me know if I should just let him play videogames whenever and however long he wants. I don't want him to have resentment towards me and start to secretly hate me. I want to have a happy and healthy marriage not one full of resentment and regret. Also, how do I get over feeling upset towards my husband when he chooses to play videogames over spending time with me?",2,1743627544.0,Marriage,33,0.63,False

I've thought about this a lot but mainly brushed it off due to the nature of my employment. I worked for Cirque du Soleil for three months last Aug-Oct. During our training we we're told that Cirque was a No-Tip brand, however if someone tipped us we couldn't give it back and we we're to give it to our Floor Leads. They told us they were going to throw us a pizza party at the end of the tour with our tips. Seemed fishy to me. I know there are many laws about managers or bosses taking tips but I needed the job and felt scared to speak up due to how serious they were about not taking tips for ourselves. The pizza party had maximum 6 pizzas lol, I'd be willing to gauge that we all made over 1000 in tips during that time. My floor lead took a 5 dollar bill from me once and happily said ""Theres my coffee money for tomorrow!"" 

Not looking to act on this, just seeing if it is illegal/misconduct in any way. They basically told us they're able to get away with it since they're a travelling international business. Is this true? 

I also know of some very disturbing and honestly disgusting things they let slide in the food and beverage department, is there somewhere I can report these potential health hazards?

The distance between the wall behind the couch to the opposite wall is about 21 feet. We have a bookshelf on the far wall, so we plan to mount the screen from the ceiling a few feet in front of that. The screen could be up to 107"" wide, but bigger than that and we start to run into some doors.

I thought I had settled on the BenQ HT2050A, with a 106"" diagonal Elite manual tab-tension 2 series. But the placement recommendation says for a 106"" screen it should be 8-12 feet way. The distance I was planning to have it be mounted on the wall would be about 17 feet away from where the screen would hang. 

Is that an issue? If so, what would resolve it? Put the projector on a coffee table in front of the couch? Bigger screen? Different projector? I don't really want to mount the projector on the ceiling.

I really like HelloChinese and Du Chinese! I will likely pay for their premium content when I run out of free sessions; I really like the material. I especially like hearing two different native people speaking on the Du Chinese app; you're able to hear different accents. Does anyone recommend other similar ones? Has anyone tried Pimsleur?

I am also listening to Coffee Break Chinese, which I really like, too. My goal is to complete a session of each per day, and go over each session a few times. I've also enrolled myself into a beginner's course starting next week for months (1 hour and 45 minutes each session, 8 total sessions). The course will also give me a lot of free material. It is with the Chicago Mandarin Chinese Center, and I've heard nothing but great things about it.

I've decided to not learn Chinese characters yet. I will focus on learning Pinyin instead. I would much rather focus my brainpower to learning the language without the heaviness of learning the character system. I also read that it's easier to learn the characters once you've settled into the language.

I found bed bugs last July in my apartment. I currently live in France. Took me about 2 months to get rid of them. Or so I thought. The 1st picture is from September 1st, no bites, no poop, only these casings that according to Google images were not from bugs. QUESTION 1: what could they be?

In January I found 1 black hairy larvae on my mattress (see 2nd picture). I assume it's a carpet beetle, since I found some last June and the summer before. I think they come back every summer. This time I looked for holes in fabric / leather and nothing, so I just amped up my vacuuming. I had no bites, but was coughing, same as this summer. QUESTION 2: does it look like a carpet beetle?

In February I started finding some hard tiny black drops that didn't smear on my mattress, like salt so I thought, OK no smear, no blood, no bed bugs. I had been checking my mattress for dark spots every morning since I found a bed bug last year. Also the ceiling is fine. I thought fleas but I have no pets. I visited a person who has a cat 3 times in Feb and March, but I thought it would be unlikely those droppings were from fleas. QUESTION 3: can cat fleas jump on a visitor and then hide and poop in their bed?

Then last Sunday I woke up with minuscule scratches on my hand I didn't remember from the day before. A tiny group of tiny dots that didn't itch and aren't raised and I panicked (right now it's just tiny scars). So I checked the fitted sheet and my pyjamas, finally found black drops that smear. I flipped the bed upside down and found 1 big brown / black stain under a bed slate, I wiped it without thinking about taking a picture and it seemed grainy, it just all came out on a tissue. I also found 1 dot of black / grey poop that smeared like a charm on a slate. I also found a larvae (see picture 3) under my coffee table. I put Terre de Sommières that is a French dessicant on my bed frame, under the slates, and under the legs. No new spots the next day. I inspected both beds on Sunday and today with a flashlight and my kid's bed frame, fitted sheet and mattress encasement don't show any traces. The anti bed bug mattress encasements that I bought last year are still on, intact.

Today I found some black dots that smear when just pressing my finger, 3 on my bed fitted sheet, 1 on my pyjamas, on my arm, and 2 on my jeans that I wear to work from home, sit on my couch etc.

From reading r / bedbugs I get that they can come back from some sort of hibernation, unclear if they can have hard drops of poop, and since itching can vary my skin may not react to bites from when the bugs are young. Does it make sense?

QUESTION 4: My kid has an Ikea Kura bed she loves. I just sprayed diatomaceous earth laced with geraniol at the basis of the bed. I think I'm going crazy again. Is there a way to place a trap for that type of bed? I was thinking yeast + sugar, but haven't read good feedback.

QUESTION 5: I borrowed a steamer yesterday and used it this morning. It's small, slow and drops a lot of water. I'm planning on buying the Polti Cimex Eradicator because I have savings. I found different info, takes 6 to 10 min to heat up a full tank, can produce steam for 45 or 60 minutes. Does it kill eggs from any bugs? Anyone who has used it could provide feedback?

QUESTION 5: Does anyone have a good receipe of yeast + sugar trap?

Thank you!

1jpzk0h,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDebate/comments/1jpzk0h/small_businesses/,Small Businesses,"(Question for US liberal and conservative residents mainly, but all opinions are welcome) 

The great unifier of both the right and left. The importance of supporting small businesses. Whether it’s the minority owned coffee shop or your racist dad’s 4 man roofing crew, the one thing that both sides agree on is the very “American” and “Freedom-Aspiring” small business owner, who seeks an existence away from corporate bureaucracy or wage labor monotony. Setting your own schedule or deciding who you can and won’t serve. All of this sounds nice, but I’m here to propose that small businesses are a net negative on society. 

1. The necessity for the concentration of capital to facilitate a liberatory workers movement. 

This point comes from historical example. In the U.S. the most militant period of time for the labor movement was during the height and fall of the gilded age. Where monopolization of whole towns led to abysmal working conditions and facilitated a unified (mostly) and organized workers movement that saw bloodshed on both sides of the business ladder. In order to achieve this level of class consciousness a key factor was the monopoly and/or company town that made it much easier to glue together workers’ strike actions, militancy, etc. Smaller businesses impede this by splitting up the workforce. It’s harder to organize if your coworkers are spread out all over a municipality after work hours.

2. Drives down wages.

Small businesses have much less capital to play around with. If they can hardly afford their buildings rent then what are the chances you will get a raise next year?  Bigger companies on average pay more and provide more benefits to workers than smaller businesses. 

3. Regulations and Safety.

Small businesses are less likely to be held accountable for OSHA violations and other malpractices. Small businesses are less safe than big businesses.

1jpzk0d,https://www.reddit.com/r/airstream/comments/1jpzk0d/need_airstream_model_recommendation/,Need Airstream Model Recommendation,"Hi! I'd like some recommendations for what Airstream model would be best for me. I am totally new to Airstreams.

I will be using it for living on my friend's property. I am single with no children. 

My requirements are:

*Dining area 
*Separate bedroom area 
*Toilet with bath/shower
*Would be great to have an awning (but optional) 

*Will be in a hot desert climate, so good air conditioning is a must! 

This trailer will be permanently parked and used just for sleeping, restroom & bathing, private relaxation time, and light meals.

I would like to be able to have someone over for a coffee, which is why I'd like a separate bedroom area.

It would be great if the bedroom or dining area could be modular so I could roll out a yoga mat for exercise. I prefer to sleep on a foldable futon.

I am used to living in small spaces (did a year in Tokyo), and I don't want any extra space that's not needed. 

This trailer will also serve as my residence while I potentially build a more permanent prefab house on the property. I expect to have this for about two years then eventually sell or repurpose. 

I love the nostalgia of the 1970s Airstreams. It would be great to get something vintage but with updated fixtures and decor. Ideally pre-2000s, but not stuck on it.

I'm thinking around $25,000 budget, but I'm flexible depending what model holds resale value. I'm willing to go up in budget if it's worth it.

Any info/direction would be appreciated.

Thanks!

1jpziek,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokunoheroFanfiction/comments/1jpziek/dekus_first_henchman/,Deku’s First Henchman,"A voice that Izuku vaguely recalled called out to him as he was aimlessly wandering the mall since his friends had all run off to do their own shopping.  “Excuse me, Midoriya-san. I would appreciate a moment of your time.” Izuku recognized the speaker after only a moment; Tsubasa-sensei, who’d been Izuku’s pediatrician. The doctor who’d diagnosed him as quirkless. His tone, and the san suffix, were oddly formal and respectful. Rather more formal and respectful than expected of an educated adult speaking to a teenager. 

“Y-yes”, said Izuku, startled. 

“Let’s chat and catch up at the cafe. My treat.” The doctor gave Izuku a smile that seemed genuine, though it, and the doctor himself seemed to have hidden depths.

Still, Izuku followed the doctor to a table after they ordered their drinks. Izuku had a latte with vanilla syrup, while the doctor had a simple brewed coffee, though he did add cream and sugar. 

After they found a table, the doctor said “Midoriya-san, I saw your performance at the sports festival, and I was quite impressed with what I saw.” 

Izuku replied “Thank you, Tsubasa-sensei. I appreciate that.” Izuku offered Tsubasa the “hero talking to civilians” face that he’d been practicing in the mirror for the past five years. 

The Doctor chuckled a little. “Ah, yes, Doctor Tsubasa, of course you know me by that name.” The doctor’s face became much more solemn. “My true name is Doctor Kyudai Garaki.” A pregnant pause, almost long enough to be uncomfortable, before he continued. “I know your quirk - your true quirk. Your performance in the sports festival made me nearly certain, and when you took your drink from me I saw the small holes in your palms.” The doctor placed his hand over his heart “it was my honor to serve the man who passed All For One on to you before his death for many, many years. It would be my honor to serve you as well.”  The doctor grinned warmly and offered his hand to Izuku. 

[This is a scene I’ve had in my head for a while. In this universe All Might actually did kill All For One in their duel six years ago, AFO died just after passing the quirk to Izuku.

A little background my only other “relationship” was when I was a senior in high school with a guy I didn’t know super well, our moms knew each other and really the only thing we had in common was having the same chronic illness. He was very nice but we ended up mutually ghosting each other after a month of dating. 

Flash forward 2 years I’m now a sophomore in college and finally starting to get into the “dating scene”. I’m extremely bad at stuff like this as I have practically no experience and am a very introverted person. Earlier in the semester I started to hit it off with a guy in class but he ghosted me and moved seats shortly after I mentioned something about being ill. I don’t know for sure that’s why but it’s a sore spot for me as I also have had friends treat me differently once I became ill. 

I finally cracked on got on the dating apps and met this girl. We talked for about a week and then I asked for her snap and eventually asked her out for coffee. We had a nice date and agreed to do it again sometime. We talked everyday and met up again a week later, again I asked her out. Now to the part that is bugging me. 

My mom said I should let her plan the next date and I honestly don’t really care about stuff like that but kept it in mind. About 2 weeks past of us talking, getting slightly less frequent, when I decided screw it and asked her out again. We had fun but it hasn’t really left the awkward phase yet despite it being a month now. I also realized that I seem to be the main one starting our text convos. I didn’t notice it because do to class we kinda had multiple hours between responses sometimes. So it seemed more even until I noticed I was the main one starting convos. I also asked how her day had been or said I had fun on the date. She always responds eventually but never starts a convo. 

I can’t tell if she is not interested or I am getting in my head. I didn’t send my usual I had fun text after our last date a few days ago and she hasn’t said anything. I don’t know if it’s in my head or she is not interested. I don’t want to come off as too much if she isn’t interested but don’t want to ghost her if she is. I’ve had a couple times where I realized I was the only person reaching out in a friendship and it sucks so I don’t know if maybe I am overthinking it because of this or what. Sorry for rambling but any advice is sorely needed. So is she not interested or am I overthinking?

1jpzeko,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_throw_away_acc-11/comments/1jpzeko/update/,Update!,"I edited my original post and added this new update but I’m not sure if it created a new post or if everyone interested in an update was able to see it so here it is:

UPDATE 18hrs later.
I still have not slept, not for lack of trying. I want to type this while it’s still fresh. I left early in the morning after she went to sleep to walk and get a coffee. I hung out at the cafe while I updated those close to me about what’s going on and reply to Reddit. I waited until I knew she left for work to go back home, shower, and try to get some rest. I spent most of the day making an exit plan, and taking all the advice about how to approach the living situation. I had already said we were over before she went to bed but I don’t think she believed me. 

When she finally got home from work she sat down on the couch across from me and said “hi”. She then proceeded to mope on the couch until I walk away, as I was waiting for her to say anything first. I ran out of time as I needed to leave for volleyball practice, so I just dropped the ultimatum: “Either you move out or I will move out. And I don’t think you can afford this place on your own.” 

I think the reality of the situation finally hit her. She immediately broke down crying and started begging to try work this out. I was emotionless and said that this is the consequences of her choices. I left for my volleyball practice as she followed me to the door crying and begging. She tried to ask where I was going and I told her it’s none of her business. I also told her on the way out that I expect her to have a plan and to start owning up the consequences of HER choices.

When I returned she tried again to beg to work this out. I reminded her that any ounce of compassion and will to continue anything with her is thrown out when I remember the sickening shit she was saying to this dude on the other side of that door, and the thought of whatever else she is STILL hiding. I told her as many of you wisely advised, that I don’t even want to know what she is hiding anymore because the fact that you are still hiding stuff from me is all the answer I need to know about what you did. 

With that, I repeated that she needed to move out as soon as possible as I cannot stand to live with her anymore. I set up my air mattress in my office, and went to bed.

Today (April 1) I worked from home as usual, went to the gym, and will be spending the evening with one of my good friends. I also called and left a message for my building manager that I’d like to discuss my lease, and its renewal. (Vague on purpose till I can explain the situation, so they don’t think I’m trying to break the lease).

I also texted ex gf this: You need to pack your shit and figure out where you’re going. As soon as you leave I will return your $2000 + however many days left in the month for what you paid in rent.

She said she’s looking for places, I asked about if she could stay with her mom but she said she couldn’t. I think she still hasn’t talked to them because her sister texted me yesterday saying she is also very upset with her, because she noticed while they were at the concert that night ex was on her phone the whole time and even had a phone call in front of her sister. She confronted Ex about it and ex blew up on her and threatened her if she told me. She related to me about similar experiences and said she is here for me. I thanked her and told her since she is so close to ex, it’s probably best we don’t talk much. She agreed and wished me the best. 

So now basically all her close family isn’t talking to her or supporting her. It doesn’t make me happy that she is suffering so badly now because of her own actions, but I also don’t care because those are her problems now. 

There are many ways and reasons I could choose to be petty and absolutely screw her even worse, but I think the direct consequences are enough. One example is in January I took her on a 3 week vacation which I payed for almost everything except for her flight and some of the accommodations that she split with me. I told her at the time that she doesn’t need to worry about paying me back, so I will at least keep my word because she definitely doesn’t have the money to pay me back even if I kept her 2k I was investing for her. 

So what will ideally happen is she is out by this weekend, but I’m not getting my hopes up just yet. I will have to supervise the move out to make sure none of my stuff is taken. I have most of the furniture and kitchen stuff from when I was living alone. I have a pretty good memory of the stuff she bought vs what I’ve bought. The stuff we split purchased for this place will have to be negotiated. Basically the only thing I will need to buy is a new bed, as we were using hers. 

Thank you again to everyone’s kind messages and comments. I want to highlight part of a DM I received that felt like they could read my mind and interpret everything I’ve been feeling:

<div>Modern clean home decor focuses on minimalism, functionality, and aesthetic simplicity. It emphasizes a clutter-free environment where every item serves a purpose and contributes to the overall design. This style is ideal for those who appreciate elegance in simplicity and seek to create a serene atmosphere within their living spaces. To achieve modern clean home decor, start by selecting a neutral color palette. Shades of white, beige, and gray create a fresh backdrop that enhances natural light and gives a spacious feel. Adding a pop of color through accessories, such as cushions or artwork, can provide visual interest while maintaining the overall clean look. Furnishings play a vital role in achieving a modern clean decor theme. Opt for furniture with sleek lines and geometric shapes. Materials like metal, glass, and light-colored wood are perfect choices, offering a contemporary feel without overwhelming the space. Multi-functional furniture, such as a coffee table with storage, also supports the minimalist ethos by reducing clutter. Incorporating plants is another effective way to enhance modern clean home decor. Indoor plants not only purify the air but also bring a touch of nature into the home. Choose simple planters that align with the style—for instance, ceramic or minimalist geometric designs. Lighting is crucial in this decor style. Natural light should be maximized through sheer curtains, while statement fixtures can provide artistic flair. Recessed lighting or minimalist pendant lights can complement the home's sleek aesthetic, ensuring spaces are well-lit yet uncluttered. Lastly, be mindful of accessories. Select a few carefully curated pieces that resonate with the overall theme, avoiding overcrowding surfaces. A modern clean home decor is about creating a balanced, inviting space that nurtures both comfort and style, making it a perfect sanctuary for modern living. </div>Check the Full Details Article Here: https://trendwaveusa.live-website.com/modern-clean-home-decor/",1,1743626851.0,AmazonBrandReviews,0,1.0,False

Right now I'm getting lukewarm brown water. That might be a bit of hyperbole, but not by much. 

I'm brewing at 16:1. 

I'm having trouble with extraction. I live at 5,000' / 1450m. I have the altitude set correctly. I'm brewing using the temps suggested from Onyx (roaster) which is 93C - should I up everything to 205 (our boiling point)?

Is there a trick to getting good, proper extraction?

1jpzczl,https://www.reddit.com/r/inZOI/comments/1jpzczl/weddings/,Weddings,"I just did my first wedding in inzoi yesterday and it was a bit of a disaster.
First of all my zoi was pregnant so I couldn't change her style, so she ended up getting married in a short party dress whereas her husband actually got to dress up beautifully.

There was no food and no toilets, although I finally figured out how to buy things for the lot about half way through when everyone was starving. So they all drank lots of coffee and ate many slices of cake. 

The other issue was the way the wedding works. Each action is just that one action if that makes sense, so I tell them to walk down the isle. They walk down the isle and then they just wander off. I feel like there should maybe be an option to do the whole wedding ceremony, but still also keep the individual actions for those that might want to do the wedding differently. 

It would be good if there was an option to hire catering, or at least allow the use of community kitchens, there's that whole kitchen there but nobody can use it right now. 

Also maybe aging should be a bit more obvious too, my young adult zoi married an adult zoi that turned to middle aged the day after the wedding. It'd be kinda cool if you could see they're zoi age in years + stage of life. 

Anyway all that aside I am really enjoying inzoi. Its great that the devs are getting lots of community feedback. Yes it is a bit bare bones right now, but it's unfair to compare it to TS4 now because TS4 started out even more bare bones than inzoi. If inzoi sticks to their promise to keep dlcs minimal and do updates every 2 months I think it will really turn into a very engaging game with lots of content. 

TLDR weddings are tricky, catering is needed. The gane is a bit bare bones but still lots of fun. Can't wait to see where it goes as it develops. ",1,1743626757.0,inZOI,2,1.0,False

I know that lots have a coffee table but for me personally mines got decor on it and it’s lower down and wouldn’t work well. Super gimmicky and not something I can use being used long term. I am curious to hear what others think of the new function though. ,1,1743626660.0,NSCollectors,5,1.0,False

We’ve been married for 2 and a half years now, have a beautiful 2-year old daughter, and I feel like i’ve just had enough of the constant nagging. I am the sole bread winner, I make good enough money for all of our needs (and wants) and I spoil the heck out of her on a daily basis. Whatever she wants, she can have. She is a SAHM, which was completely her own decision, which I support 100%. Our agreement is that she be the full time caregiver for our daughter, and of the house, food etc because personally, I don’t have time for that as i run a full time business and i’ve mentioned before i’d rather pay for babysitters and pre made meals or even cleaners because doing that myself would cost me money( offered this plenty of times). (Although i still do help (not close to as much as she does) feeding our 2 year old daughter, making food, cleaning up etc). Whenever she is tired or feeling overwhelmed i offer help by suggesting we drop the baby off at my parents or hers , so she can get some time to herself. She declines and says it’s her job. No problem. I’m just not a person that likes to repeatedly talk about problems or issues, i strive for solutions.

Today she bombarded me (as per usual) about how I don’t do enough and I never help and how I never spend time with her, (even though I try to take us out to dinner once a week, if not out we order in and eat while watching movies).  How I don’t appreciate the work she does and how I also downplay the work she does like it’s nothing. Which isn’t what I do at all. She puts words in my mouth and when i ask her to explain when i’ve said or done such things to prove that, she has nothing in return. I feel like it’s never enough. I sympathize with her and offer solutions to help, but I also remind her how of our agreement that we have in place, then she turns it around and says she can’t talk to me because of “how i talk to her” that i make her feel like i don’t care of that she means nothing to me. I’m just tired of trying to prove that, i shouldn’t have to as my actions show greatly how much i care and how much help i actually do give as it is. I appreciate her greatly and i tell her that, and show her by spoiling her. But apparently it’s not enough. I feel like zero appreciation comes my way by the complaining she does, and that my efforts go no where because apparently i’m not doing enough.


I’ve recently started doing more work from our home office, and we drink coffee together every morning, we eat dinner everyday together, we spend ample amount of time together but to her it’s not enough. She says i’m up in my office not doing anything and it’s just to get away, which isn’t the case because how else would we be able to afford the lifestyle we’re living if we don’t work hard for it. Before we moved into the home we live in now (renting). I had mentioned maybe that the house would be too much on her, but she insisted it wouldn’t. Which is now a problem. I almost never bring any issues I have up unless it’s worth bringing up, i am very grateful for my life and blessings and VERY simple (plus most things i bring up spark an argument) I don’t ask for much besides her doing her part as i do mine. I try to help her meet her goals by holding her accountable as couples should do, for example she wanted to start waking up earlier so she could get more done, so i offered to help and she was happy about that. But when she stopped trying and i brought it up, she sparks an argument and it’s now my fault. She tells me i think i’m better than her just because i want her to do better, to hold her self accountable and to wake up early and hit that goal because it’s what she wants. This happens a lot. About everything. (I wish i had someone to push me and hold me accountable, but no complaints because i push myself, and am grateful to have that drive.)

I’m just tired of dealing with this, and tired of everything being my fault. This may be all over the place, but that’s where my mind is at the moment. Just want some input from you guys. Would appreciate that. Does this seem fair?",3,1743626654.0,relationship_advice,62,0.59,False

———————————————————————-
edit: i literally edited the piece but i won’t touch it now i promise. i gotta get out of my head. 


Dear You, a distant strike of lightning. One who has burned away my grass:

Mickey and I walked into a bar together— 
a dive bar with sticky chairs and nearly no light. The creaking wood was more musically enticing than the gaudy rock that the bartender had chosen. She was a blue haired woman with a square jaw, and she held her head in hostility— grinding her teeth, dragging her tense hands across the wooden bar. 

“ID’s!” She yelled at both of us. 

I wondered why she did that. If I was alone, I’d have my ID out and ready. I was young, twenty-four, and I was a perfect doll. My face may have been innocent, implying that I was much too young to have a beer, but I was dwelling into the spoiled years of a woman. 
Usually when Mickey and I were together, no one wanted to question my age, to make a scene of a doll and a man, but this woman held her position. 

Mickey pulled out a piece of plastic, but I only had my passport on me. The woman quickly scanned my photo, then she took Mickey’s ID into her hands and massaged it like it was worthy of being destroyed. 
He was twelve years older than me– well into being an adult. I wondered if the bartender only wanted to ID me or maybe she was passing judgment on our connection. Was I dressed like a victim?
Did he see me this way? 

It didn’t help that Mickey was in a pout, and he was having an internalized dilemma about his desire for snow. I told him he didn’t need it, but he didn’t want to hear it. He watched the door as I spoke to him. 
The bartender slammed down our drinks and demanded the money. Mickey pulled out his wallet; I took out cash for a tip. 

But even through the mundane transaction of payment, my head was an asteroid, separate from all other beings, and it was completely drowning in water’s words. I wanted to tell the bartender that innocence and infantilization are not the same thing. 

Here I am: everything I say is designed to realign and release, but here I am to say to you directly: why do you want to lose yourself? Maybe because you are something else… someone else. Maybe you won’t show it to me. 
You don’t have to show me. I’m just wondering. 

Mickey drowned me away with the downpour of liquor. I had barely touched my cup. 
The bartender growled as she took the cash from the bar and subsequently vacated the premises. We sat alone, and there was something he wanted to tell me. I could tell by the way he slanted his eyes, how he watched the way my hands gripped the cup. Mickey circled his head and scanned the entirety of the bar, but no view seemed to bring him ease. 
All around us, there were noises: the music, the tapping of feet, laughter, popping thuds from the dart board. 

Not one object was still or content. Not one person was quiet or cool. Mickey was looking at me. His legs were in a T and his foot was chopping at the air. He created himself into a fan, pushing air onto my bare thighs, and I felt fragile as my skin became prickly. 
I looked down at my body, at the bumps on my legs, and I wondered why humans get these goosebumps when they’re cold or scared. 
I wondered if I would crack like ice.  
Am I a girl only because he wants me to be?

“I need a cigarette,” he told me, sniffing, and that was my cue to hop off my seat and follow him where it was that he wanted to go. I didn’t mind following him, but I wanted him to know that I was a smart girl, too, and I followed him because I wanted to follow him, not because he told me. 
He was not fiction, thus he was not an arrow. Mickey was not a fantastic portrait that moved and talked, and I really wanted him to talk to me. 

We stood outside, watching cars go toward the infinite realm of neon signs— buildings of capitalist detonations. Bars aligned in a row; bars that sang predestined songs at a volume that was distorted and ugly. The sounds blended with the talk of all these drunken crooks that screamed and yelled for no apparent reason. I screwed up my eyes at the noises. 
Mickey lit a cigarette, and I stepped away from him as I didn’t like the smoke. Beside him, there was a high stoop, one that he took—effortlessly— and he left me down below. Mickey watched as so many cars brushed past us, and he used their defiance of friction as a catharsis more interesting than a lover— me, and he watched them go by, pressing his thoughts into their trunks, hoping that his fears could drive away in the passenger seat. 
He was speaking, but none of it mattered. His hands clutched at a straw. It was squashed and flattened.

In my head, I reminded him that those thoughts wouldn’t be gone; they would have just been transferred to someone else, and round and round a car does go; I guarantee that they will return as they do belong to him and him alone. 
Like underwear with one’s name on the elastic. 

You: look at your thoughts. They’re tails are wagging. 
Jagged teeth, tongues that kiss.
Presence : Desire.  
These thoughts aren’t as scary as they seem. 

As Mickey tossed his cigarette back to the earth, a man with a red vinyl cap strutted down the street. He held a large canvas painting in his hands. His skinny legs swung and leaped, and he quickly made his way up to us. 

“Hi, how you doing tonight?” 

There was a chip in his front tooth. 

“This is an original of mine.” The light from the street lamp caught the purples and greens of the canvas. It wasn’t anything interesting; the man’s manic shakes were much more intriguing. 
On the canvas, there were sloppy strokes of aurora borealis made up for the purpose of monetary manipulation and not by any first hand awe of its beauty. Mickey stepped down to meet him. 

“I’m selling it for $30 if you're interested by chance, my man?” 

The pronunciation of the price stuck in my head. I looked at Mickey. Mickey looked at the man. 
It was funny to be on the outside of the scenario, especially as I was the one who could relate to this guy: I was a painter, too. 
Neither of them looked at me, though. It was just me, tied to Mickey’s hand, as though I was an extension of his being– nothing more than the watch on his wrist. He crossed his arms.

Mickey spoke up, “I really can’t right now, you know: car note, rent, bills…” His voice was squeezed yet legato, tired and annoyed, but still contrite and defined. 

“I’m colorblind,” I said, trying to subdue my smile but again, only my friends, the shadows, heard me. I was listed as unwatched. 

Eventually, the man gave up; he walked away. His orange shoes bounced and popped at every nook and cranny of the terrain. 

What is it like to be a man? 
Where am I?
Hello, hello! Sorry, I need to turn back on. 
Someone else turned me off. 
This is my reality– but Mickey wasn’t listening.

He turned to me, and he was disoriented in his step but quiet with bones transposed by gravity. A warmth entered his hands as he used his fingers to fix his hair, pushing it behind his ears with a softness that was rare from him. He looked genuinely beautiful, and I knew he cared about that more than he should. 
He had big ears. Big nose. I liked both of those things.
I thought that he was more than beautiful. Hostage of pain; mean to me; humanly beautiful.  
He smiled at me, but it quickly faded away. 

“Ugh, Iris,” he kicked his cigarette away and regained his spot on the stoop. He looked at me, and I wanted to look at him, but his eyes were too much for me to understand. 

“I love women, like, I really do. I like to be around women. When I was younger, my first crush was on my cousin. The women in my life were really the ones who raised me. They were always sweet to me and you know, it takes a village. But I was a good kid, shy. Shy like you. Anyway, my cousins were always around, and I loved my one cousin who always babysat me. In my eyes, she was beyond perfect. I think she knew me better than anyone else, too.” 

As I listened to his hushed voice, everyone around us dispersed. The night became darker, and it was just Mickey and I in a void. Chiron was directly above him. 

“This was so long ago, but she was my very first crush. My very first love. I was a kid, innocent, but I knew I loved her.”  
The words were lulled but crawling. They took their time walking through the air, finding my ears. 
Mickey touched the memory as he told it. 
“She died when I was still very young. Cancer. She was in her twenties. I still miss her to this day.” 
He swept the words into the air, watching them float back down to earth with grave fear. There was a picture of a swan reflected in his eyes as though the memory was being televised. 
I saw his eyes breathe lively:
I am quiet. Eyes wide. 
That was yours to hold, and I am not asking to help you. 
I don’t know what to say— I’m so sorry. 

Hi,
How does it feel to release like that? Now the words are no longer a secret for yours to chew; they are a feast at the table. Everyone is dissecting them with each bite, but can I tell you something?—
      Thanks for sharing that with me. 

He didn’t let the moment linger; I let my naked wrist become a home for his lips. A kiss made a sound on my body, and I wondered if I could keep this memory for myself or if I should let myself linger in its meaning. 
I wondered if I should let it become my soul or if I should share it with my diary. 
Was it even mine to share?

His voice was gruff like he had just woken up, “Fuck it all.” 

Maybe not. 
Mickey’s back was completely upright.

There’s a part of me who has written this chapter only for his eyes. 

The bartender came outside for a second. I read her face, studied it for her deepest secret. She was studying the roads, how they were laced with dirty water spat out by fiction-less people. A slight turn of her lips, down and down, as though she had lost sight of her image in the mirror. The water was too murky to find her own meaning. 
Are we all the same? 

I turned to watch Mickey keel over my body. I expected a kiss perched on his lips, but he was only covering me in his shadow. 

We were tree and bird. 
Death, to me, was release. My mother was mean to me. My sister was innocent but she was truly my burden. When they left this world, there was a new cavity in my teeth, but my braces were off and I was allowed relief. 
Nobody’s ever taken from me because— baby, I never had anything to begin with. 
For Mickey, death took purity. It took, and it killed. 
It took love away from his breath, and all he was left with was himself. 
He’d touched the sun— he had the sun— but then it took away his breath, so he slowly descended into the night where he found me. And I was a wolf, I was a fairy. I was something that didn’t exist. 
But for a second, I didn’t care. 
He stood there before me, writing on the walls with a marker. A tag— a word:
Scam. 

Does he belong here? With me? 
Solipsistic Girl: Ambient Boy. 
I never ever want to hurt you, even though you’ve hurt me. 

Why does everything have to die? 
Mickey and I left the bar, and it felt like all that changed was the pace of my heart. Our fingers brushed; he almost held my hand. I let my soul hang limp.

But I could hear his mind asking me, what are you doing?

You said my name. A plane stopped above us. A bird crystalised. There was a pause in the story— Fiction collapsed and reality remembered:
You called me Anna. 
I’d say your name, but I know I shouldn’t. 
You are not my painting; you are a whole other world. 

All you ever wanted was a vague mixture of everything and nothing. What’s the difference you may ask– 
And to that, I say, good question. Infinite, the metaphor of question. 
I wish I was covered in pure nothing. 
Bury me in the soil. 

You,
I always wonder why my mind is still deciphering the show. 
For a while, I wanted you to suffer. That is not my intention: to make you suffer from my work. Actually, I hope you find this beautiful. 
Why can’t it be beautiful to sort through one’s own mind? I do it too much.
At first, I wrote this to talk about power dynamics and femininity.
It transformed into something else— I simply remembered. 
Oh, memory. How you can be so sweet… 
Here I am! Squeezing memory out. 
And you,
Take this in whatever way you want to take it–
Scream. 
Yell. 
Hex me.
Know that I am here not to tell your story. I am only telling mine.

Like an eagle,
Like a final breath,
Be free.

1jpz3vw,https://i.redd.it/07pmhb0pfhse1.png,Aqua Dubai vs Montagne Imaginary,"Received a decant of Imagination at the end of last summer and felt that it was full bottle worthy, but was not willing to pay LV prices for it. After some research I blind bought Haramain's Aqua Dubai, and got a decant of Imaginary from Montagne more recently.
If you're considering buying any of the 3, hopefully this can help you make a decision depending on what you're looking for. I also asked a hot chick what she thought of the 3 on test strips, as that seems to be an important piece of information for a lot of us (whether we admit it or not) & it makes the test more fun.

I won't go into the OG much, but try to get your nose on it if you can. It comes across as really high quality. Fresh citrus and ginger, tea, and soap. Longevity is good on me at 6-7 hours. I'd say it's totally unisex.

Aqua Dubai: First test sprays came across as much harsher than the OG, but I put it away to let it settle. I think the bottle is kinda corny, but the pressurized atomizer on it is really good.
Revisiting it after a week or two, the fragrance had smoothed out. It still has a brashness that the OG does not, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. It is more in your face with darker fruits than the citrus-ginger pop that Imagination has up front; I get black currant and melon. You should take care not to overspray this or else you risk it being abrasive to people around you. 3 sprays lasts from morning into the night; it blows the OG out of the water in that respect.
Aqua Dubai leans more masculine than the OG and may not be suitable for women. It lacks the tea note that so many people enjoy in Imagination, so you should consider that if the tea is one of your favorite aspects. I'd say this is slightly soapier than Imagination in the dry down, but it's a soapy DNA in general.

Imaginary: Ordered a decant from a member of the Montagne subreddit (thanks u/AyybrahamLmaocoln). It's one of the brand's most popular fragrances and is well regarded in that community. I have sampled a few others and found them to be of good quality, but I can't speak on the atomizer that comes on the 50ml.
The citrus is a bit harsher than the OG, but I don't have a problem with that as it chills out after a few minutes. I detect more ginger than the OG, and it registers as being sweeter throughout the lifespan of the fragrance. Longevity is on par with the original, 6-7 hours.
I consider this to be completely unisex. Montagne gets the more delicate, aromatic side of Imagination down very well, but I do not pick up on a tea note in this either. Soapiness is equal to the OG.

Hot chick opinion: Tester strip #1 was the OG, #2 was Montagne, and #3 was Aqua Dubai.
#1 was received positively but #2 elicited a negative reaction. The Montagne came across as very harsh to her and she didn't volunteer much else about it. She took a whiff of coffee in between tests and we cycled through a few times. She preferred the original more than Aqua Dubai, but disliked the Montagne so much that it surprised me.

Conclusion: I LIKE Imagination but do not LOVE it, and truthfully I got bored of the DNA while testing these. That said, I am a good candidate for enjoying a dupe/twist and am happy with my full size of Aqua Dubai, and plan to wear it often this summer.
I enjoy the boldness of it and the additional fruits make it a more playful wear. The strength of it is a bonus if you apply with discretion. Had I gotten a bottle of Imaginary first, I would've been happy with that as well because it's so close to the original and I enjoy wearing it just as much.
If you want something a little louder, go with Al Haramain. If you want something a little more refined, go with the Montagne. Aqua Dubai feels more suitable for a poolside rager, while the Montagne is more suitable for work or dressing up in the day; either one replaces Imagination for me.

But... if you're someone who loves Imagination, save up for the original if you have to, especially if you're after that tea note. These other two are great but not 1:1.

Recently about two weeks ago I changed my diet for two days I wanted to try smoothies it was healthy flaxseeds chia blueberries and green bananas almond milk nothing crazy but I have noticed changes in my stool not sure why so I cut it off I had honey for my throat and dates since it’s healthy and natural but also cut it off and went back to my clean diet smaller meals no sugar whatsoever and no bread and then acid reflux boom out of nowhere started 9 days ago or so 
I get  Acid reflux even if I drink WATER!! And my stool isn’t formed is weird I could feel the acids coming up in my THROAT it was so weird for me cause my diet is clean why am I still having acid reflux maybe from the dates I ate or the too much bread I had or smoothie, i was sick 3 weeks ago went to END cause my voice was gone he gave me ppi panto i was like it could the panto made acid reflux i used it for 7 days
I went to my dr today and told him all about it im on day 9 clean diet could be the dates affected me ? He said no dates I have no problem with that, u must ate junk food coffee, chocolate, no I never did I didn’t break my diet except when I had dates and smoothie told me u still didn’t break it you must ate too much and slept that cause you that!!! 
Since ur diet is clean im thinking it could be stress u got sad or too happy had annoying dream ur mental affect ur stomach!! And also im thinking the issue is in your stomach something inside  not the dates u had he prescribed me ppi and muscle relaxation for gas and cramps 
Ppi 40mg 2x a day for 5 days then reduce it for 1x a day u could continue on it for the next month or two 
And 2x for the other medication 
If you still didn’t get better I’ll give u another medication and then after a month will have to do a hpylori re test just to make sure and gastroscopy to see. 
Told him I want to make my stomach acid strong when can I break my diet he said not now after 2 months ur good then break it after a month I have an appointment with him for a follow up. 

I know this is along post. 
It has been hard for me crying and feeling frustrated by this randomly getting burning sensation and I feel the acid coming up in my throat and I taste it smt I can’t sleep because of it I tried licorice root tea small amount didn’t help so I’m gonna start taking the meds tomorrow I know ppi is not ideal but i have to take the medicine he gave and hope for the best. I’m doing deep breathing exercises even tho when I do it I feel acid coming up my throat 😢 will I ever get better 
Any one else having issues with acid reflux how to manage it or an advice😩?",3,1743626133.0,HPylori,12,1.0,False
1jpz3pe,https://www.reddit.com/r/FlairEspresso/comments/1jpz3pe/flairespresso_noob_question_about_the_12_ratio/,Flair/espresso noob question about the 1:2 ratio,"New to espresso and the Flair, and after doing some reading I want to check my foggy understanding with people who know this space. 

The thing I'm curious about is this 18 in/36 out, 1:2 ratio.  

My understanding so far is that group head in the Flair can hold ~88 grams of water and the basket is designed for 18 grams. When pulling a shot I'm pressing that water through ~18 grams of coffee grounds. Pressing all of that through the puck gives me around 56 grams of coffee (dissolved solids and water) and a ratio in the neighbourhood of 1:3.

If I want to get 36 grams out and that 1:2 ratio, it seems like I need to stop the shot when I hit that weight (I guess I could put less water in the group head to try to hit that weight... but that seems complicated? Do people do that?).

The total weight of an unknown amount of water plus an unknown amount of solids is a confusing endpoint to measure somehow... rather than disolved solids, water in/out or reduction in weight of the puck or something. Is this just a ""most people have scales and not refractometers"" thing?

I still haven't really wrapped my head around the effects of speed (trying to pull the shot faster or slower).

I'm enjoying the coffee either way, but I'd like to actually understand this better. 
Am I thinking about this right? Is there some explanation that made it click for you?",1,1743626121.0,FlairEspresso,3,1.0,False

# Tervis Water Bottle 2025: Reviews, Comparisons & Best Models (is It Worth it?)

Staying hydrated is more than just a trend; it’s a cornerstone of a healthy lifestyle. And for many, the *tervis water bottle* has become synonymous with both hydration and personalization. But as we head into 2025, it's time to take a fresh look at what Tervis offers, comparing models, exploring designs, and answering the crucial question: Is a *tervis water bottle* still worth the investment?

## Why Tervis? A Brand built on Durability and Personalization

Since 1946, Tervis has been a household name, renowned for its insulated drinkware.

Many come standard *tervis with lid*,but these are easily replaceable if lost or damaged.

These models offer the enhanced insulation and durability that stainless steel provides, keeping drinks cold for extended periods – typically up to 24 hours. These often feature a powder-coated finish for added grip and style. If maximizing insulation is a priority, these stainless steel models are a top contender for *best insulated water bottle* from Tervis.

**3. Venture Lite Insulated Water Bottle:** Positioned as a lightweight and versatile option, the Venture Lite series balances ease of use with insulation. These bottles frequently enough feature push-button operation, a secure lock, and easy carry handles. Claiming to be leakproof and fitting in most cup holders,these are a sensible choice for on-the-go hydration.

**4. Tervis Travel Mug & Coffee Mug:** Don’t forget Tervis's lineup of coffee-specific drinkware! The *tervis travel mug* and *tervis coffee mug* variations are designed for hot beverages, often featuring convenient handles and spill-resistant lids.

1jpyx4v,https://www.reddit.com/r/irishtourism/comments/1jpyx4v/7_day_itinerary_dublin_killarney_galway/,"7 day itinerary- Dublin, Killarney, Galway","7 day trip- couple from US- traveled March 21-29 2025- Dublin, Killarney, and Galway. 

We are in our mid- thirties, no kids. We value quality and convenience. Our goal was to spend a lot of time outside and experience the local culture. I was happy with our trip and would have picked the same cities if I could do it over again. I hope this is helpful! Thank you all for your help in planning our trip. 

Day 1: landed in Dublin at 4:55AM
- Stayed at Hyatt the Liberties: great location, comfortable bed, water refill stations and free water/nespresso in room. We booked the room for the night before so that we could check in and sleep for 5 hours. This is completely unnecessary but felt worth it for us. 
- Walked around the city for most of the day. We went to St.Stephens Green park and Merrion square park. 
- We went to the Guinness storehouse. I recommend making a reservation or you may not get in. The experience is cool if you like beer. It’s a modern, interactive museum. We are not big beer drinkers so I would have been fine skipping and going to a distillery instead. 
- We had dinner at Spitafields. Highly recommend.  For three drinks and 7 plates, it was $160 USD. We sat at the bar and really enjoyed the experience. The kitchen is completely open to the tables. Must make reservation. 
- Drinks at 1661. Also highly recommend. The bartender at Spitafields described it as ‘the best cocktail bar in Ireland’ so we had to check it out. It is a pricey spot with drinks at 15 euros/each. I recommend making a reservation. 

Day 2- 8:30AM train from Dublin to Killarney 
- stayed at the Brehon hotel. It’s a 20 minute walk from the city center. It was nice. Definitely an older clientele. It probably would have been out of our budget during peak season. 
- Brunch at Mannas. Great food, highly recommend. 
- We hitched a taxi to Muckross house and walked around Killarney national park. The trails are beautiful. We walked then to the Muckross Abbey then back to our hotel. 
- Drinks at Pigs Lane. We enjoyed the cocktails and live music. 
- Dinner at Kitty o’Sheas. We had the fish and chips and Halibut. Both were great. Reservations are needed during busy season. We were lucky to get the last table. 
- Ice cream at Murphys. Great flavors, I recommend checking out. 

Day 3- Killarney
- we splurged on a private tour of the ring of Kerry. We used Kerry Experience Tours. Esther was a fantastic tour guide and driver. The cost was $400 for 7 hours. We decided on a private tour because we wanted to go off the beaten path and have a more intimidate experience. It was the highlight of our trip. 
- We had dinner at Mazus. We had the ramen, katsu, and a couple of sushi rolls. It was one of our more expensive meals but good. 

Day 4- bus from Killarney to Galway
- we took the 7:30AM big green bus to Limerick then the 9:45 city link bus to Galway. 
- Brunch at Ard Bia at Nimmos. Highly recommend. You need reservations for dinner. 
- Dinner at Dough Bros. Highly recommend. Some of the best pizza I’ve had. 
- We spent the day walking around the city. I recommend the trail by the water. 
- We had a beer at the crane bar. Fantastic local pub. 
- We stayed at the Galmont hotel. Service was good and bed was comfortable. I likely would not stay here again because there was no coffee machine, no smart tv, and the shower was hot/cold. 

Day 5- day tour from Galway to cliffs of moher
- We booked a tour through Lallys. Greg was our driver. Though we do not like big coach tours, it was fantastic. The tour stopped in the burrens, a cave (optional), the cliffs, and Doolin for lunch. 
- We had dinner at Dough Bros again because it was so good. 
- We had drinks at the Buddha Bar

Day 6- day trip from Galway to kylemore abbey 
- We booked through Wild Atlantic Tours. We had such a great experience with Lallys that I wish we would have gone through them again. We chose this tour because they gave us the choice between 3 hours at Connemara national park and Kylemore. 
- Kylemore Abbey was pretty and we enjoyed it. If the weather would have been nice then I would have preferred going to Connemara national park.
- Dinner at Freddy’s. Salad was fantastic, pasta was meh. 
- Drinks at Tigh Nora. It was definitely the place to be on a Thursday. Fantastic live music and good drinks. It’s connected to two other bars. 

Day 7- Galway to Dublin by train
- We stayed at the Alex hotel. The service and rooms were fantastic. 
- We bought some souvenirs at Industry & Co. They have a few of them in the city and we thought it was the best modern gift shop. We bought a scarf, jewelry, and chocolate. 
- Walked through the botanical gardens. Worth it if you like flowers and plants. 

Day 8- fly back to the US
- Coffee at the Cloud Picker. Highly recommend for those who like trendy coffee and pour overs. 
- we explored the Dublin Castle. I wish we would have had time to do a walking tour. 
- Lunch at the Pig and Heifer. Great sandwiches. Highly recommend. 
- Flight at 5pm. We arrived 2.5 hours prior. It took 30 minutes to get through security but I think we were lucky. There is pre clearance in Ireland if you are traveling to the US. In peak season I would probably leave 3 hours for security. 

Things to know: 
- Car vs no car: we did not rent a car and we were happy with this decision after our tours to the Ring of Kerry and the Cliffs of Moher. It would have stressed us out, especially with the rain. 
- Water refill stations are everywhere. We loved this. 
- Weather was mostly sunny/cloudy. We had rain for one day a couple of short showers on other days. It definitely changes rapidly throughout the day.
- Killarney does not offer single use cups. You have to pay $2 for a reusable cup that you can return when you are done. We also loved this. 
- Download the freenow taxi app if you don’t have a car. Basically uber for taxis but more affordable
- Cash vs card: we found that people did not care whether we used cash or card. Cash was nice to have for tipping a few euros 
- Make reservations in advance for dinners and cocktails. It’s a must. 
- We learned that buses traveling from city to city are often late. Ours was 30 min late. Consider this when booking. 

Clothing packed for late March:
- water proof coat with a detachable inside. During the day we were able to wear the inside jacket only
- Umbrella
- Winter hat and gloves were used everyday
- I wish I would have packed insulated leggings. My legs were cold on a couple of the tours.
- comfortable shoes. We walked 50+ miles over the week. ",6,1743625670.0,irishtourism,4,0.88,False

1jpyvyd,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1jpyvyd/the_forgotten_shore/,The Forgotten Shore,"Rebecca Morgan stood at the kitchen window of her lakeside cottage, watching mist drift across the water. Three years had passed since she moved to this quiet spot, away from questions and stares. Here, among the pines and water, she'd built a peaceful life—or so she told herself.

She drank her morning tea, trying to ignore the tremor in her hand that had started last Tuesday. The doctors found nothing wrong. ""Maybe stress,"" they said. Rebecca had nodded, knowing there was no medical answer for what was happening to her. She'd been to the small clinic in town twice now, and both times left with the same non-diagnosis. Small towns had small answers.

The tremor wasn't the only thing. Sleep had become a battlefield lately. Rebecca would lie awake, listening to the water lap against the shore, counting breaths until exhaustion finally won. When sleep did come, it brought dreams of narrow hallways that led to locked doors, of running without moving, of voices calling her name from rooms she couldn't find.

Some mornings, like today, she woke up smelling lavender—her mother's perfume. Other mornings, it was James's aftershave that woke her. These ghosts had been showing up more and more often.

""Just memories,"" she said to the empty room.

She finished her tea and placed the cup in the sink. Dishes from last night's dinner still sat unwashed—a single plate, a single fork. Rebecca had always been tidy before, but lately, the effort seemed too much. What was the point of keeping things in order when no one else was around to see?

The cottage phone rang, making her jump. Rebecca hardly ever got calls; few people had her number. The landline was really a concession to the spotty cell service out here. Most days, she forgot it existed.

""Hello?"" she answered.

No one spoke, just the sound of waves hitting a shore.

""Hello? Who is this?""

The line went dead. Rebecca put the phone down, her hand shaking badly now. This wasn't the first strange call. Three days ago, she'd picked up to hear breathing, then a woman's voice—too faint to make out words but familiar enough to send chills through her.

She decided a walk might help. After pulling on a light jacket, Rebecca stepped outside into the crisp autumn air. The cottage sat on a small rise above the lake, with a winding path that led down through woods to a secluded beach. The realtor had called this a ""private slice of paradise"" when Rebecca bought the place. At the time, privacy was all that mattered.

The path was familiar beneath her feet, worn by three years of daily walks. Rebecca knew every twist, every root that stuck up ready to trip the unwary. The forest was quiet today, just the sound of wind in the pines and her own footsteps on fallen needles.

This had become her safe place since moving here, where the water against sand often calmed her thoughts. When the memories threatened to surface, she'd come here and let the rhythm of the waves wash them away again.

Today, the beach wasn't empty.

A woman stood by the water, her back to Rebecca. She wore a pale blue dress that Rebecca knew right away—her mother's favorite, the one she was buried in. Long gray hair hung down her back, moving slightly in the breeze.

""Mom?"" Rebecca couldn't stop herself from calling out.

The figure didn't turn. Instead, she walked slowly into the lake, the water rising past her knees, then her waist.

""Stop!"" Rebecca shouted, running forward. ""Please stop!""

By the time Rebecca reached the water, the figure had disappeared beneath the surface. Without thinking, Rebecca jumped in, searching in the murky water. The cold shocked her system, making her gasp. The lake was deeper than it looked from shore, the bottom dropping away suddenly. Her clothes dragged her down as water filled her shoes. Her hands found nothing but cold water and mud.

Gasping, she stumbled back to shore, her clothes soaked and heavy. As she fell onto the sand, Rebecca saw something shining among the rocks—her mother's silver locket, the one Rebecca had placed around her neck before closing the casket.

With shaking fingers, she picked up the cold metal. Water dripped from its surface, but it wasn't tarnished as it should have been after years underground. The clasp opened easily, revealing the small photo inside—Rebecca as a child, smiling next to her mother during a summer picnic at the lake. They had the same smile, people always said. The same eyes.

Rebecca turned the locket over in her palm. On the back, freshly engraved, were the words: *Remember what happened in the kitchen*.

Rebecca dropped the locket like it burned her. There had been no engraving when she'd put it with her mother. And the kitchen—those words chilled her more than the wet clothes clinging to her skin.

Leaving the locket in the sand, Rebecca ran back up the path to the cottage. Inside, she stripped off her wet clothes and stood under a hot shower until her skin turned pink. The bathroom mirror fogged up, hiding her reflection. She was grateful for that.

""It wasn't real,"" she told herself as she dried off. ""Grief plays tricks.""

But grief shouldn't last three years, should it? Grief shouldn't make you see things, find things that couldn't possibly be there.

Rebecca dressed in dry clothes and made herself a sandwich she didn't eat. The cottage felt different somehow—colder, despite the heat she'd turned up. The walls seemed to be watching her.

That night, she couldn't sleep. Rain hit the cottage windows as wind blew through the trees. A proper autumn storm had moved in, the kind that knocked out power and took down branches. When thunder crashed, Rebecca reached for James's side of the bed out of habit, touching only cold sheets.

James would have loved storms like this. He'd always pull back the curtains to watch lightning split the sky, count the seconds between flash and boom to calculate the storm's distance. ""It's moving away,"" he'd tell her, or ""Hold on, the worst is still coming."" Always so certain about things like that.

A door creaked somewhere in the cottage.

Rebecca sat up, trying to hear over the storm. Footsteps—heavy ones—moved across the living room floor.

""Who's there?"" she called out, her voice thin with fear.

The footsteps kept coming, now in the hallway, getting closer to her bedroom. Rebecca tried to turn on the lamp, but nothing happened. Power out from the storm.

The bedroom door slowly opened. Lightning flashed, showing a tall figure in the doorway—James's outline.

""James?"" she whispered. ""It can't be.""

The figure came toward the bed, and in another flash of lightning, Rebecca saw his face—handsome as ever, but with a deep cut across his forehead that wasn't there when they buried him. Blood ran from the wound, black in the lightning's glare.

""Becky,"" he said, his voice exactly as she remembered it. ""We need to talk about what happened.""

Rebecca screamed, backing up until she hit the headboard. When the next lightning flash came, the room was empty.

She huddled under the blankets, shaking, until morning light filtered through the curtains. The storm had passed, leaving behind fallen branches and puddles in the yard. Rebecca moved through the cottage like a ghost herself, checking locks, looking for signs of an intruder.

There were none. The front door was still locked from the inside, the windows secure.

She made coffee, strong and black, hoping it would clear her head. As she drank, Rebecca tried to make sense of what was happening. Hallucinations? Maybe. A brain tumor? The doctors hadn't found anything wrong, but maybe they'd missed something. Or maybe she really was losing her mind.

The phone rang again. This time, Rebecca let it ring until the ancient answering machine picked up. A voice she recognized immediately began to speak.

""Rebecca, honey,"" her mother said. ""It's time to come home. You've been running long enough.""

Rebecca lunged for the phone, but by the time she grabbed it, the line was dead again. The answering machine showed no recorded message.

She finally fell asleep that afternoon on the couch, and dreamed of the kitchen in their old house—of knives and red spreading across white tile. She dreamed of her mother saying, ""How could you?"" and James's eyes going wide with shock. She dreamed of her own hands doing terrible things.

In the dream, she saw the sequence clearly: Her mother finding James and Rebecca kissing in the kitchen of her childhood home, where they'd been living after James lost his job. The disgust on her mother's face—not just at catching them in an intimate moment, but deeper disgust that had been building for months.

""He's using you,"" her mother had said. ""He's only with you for your money—my money. He lost his job on purpose. He's turning you against me.""

Rebecca hadn't believed it then—had defended James fiercely. But now, in the dream, doubt crept in. Had there been signs she'd ignored? The money troubles that never seemed to get better. The way he'd suggested they move in with her mother ""just temporarily."" The calls Rebecca sometimes overheard, James speaking too quietly for her to make out words.

The fight that followed—her mother's disgust at their relationship, her threats to cut Rebecca off, to tell everyone what a mistake she'd made marrying James.

""I've hired a private investigator,"" her mother said in the dream. ""I know what he's been doing. Who he's been seeing.""

James trying to calm her mother down, getting pushed away hard.

""Tell her,"" her mother demanded. ""Tell her about the other women. Tell her about the money you've been stealing.""

The knife block on the counter.

Rebecca's hand grabbing the biggest one.

What happened next was still blurry, but Rebecca remembered enough: her mother's look of betrayal, James trying to stop her, turning the knife on him in her rage.

Then the careful cleanup. The fake break-in. The crying when she called police. The act at two funerals. The insurance money that bought this far-away cottage where no one would ask questions.

Rebecca woke with a gasp, her heart pounding. These weren't dreams—they were memories, forcing their way to the surface after years of being buried.

She stumbled to the bathroom, throwing up into the toilet. When she looked up, the mirror showed not her face, but her mother's, mouth opening to speak.

""Why, Rebecca? We could have worked it out.""

Rebecca punched the glass, breaking it. Blood dripped from her knuckles into the white sink. She wrapped her hand in a towel, not bothering to clean up the shattered pieces.

Over the next few days, Rebecca's reality began to break like the mirror. The cottage changed—sometimes she'd walk into the kitchen to find it had become the kitchen from her old home, complete with knife block and bloodstains she couldn't scrub away. The refrigerator would be filled with her mother's food—almond milk she never drank, the special jam her mother ordered from overseas.

Sometimes she'd find James sitting in the living room chair, the wound in his head bleeding, looking at her with sad eyes.

""We need to talk about what happened,"" he would say, but Rebecca always ran from the room before he could finish.

Her mother appeared too—standing at the end of the dock, floating outside windows, sitting on Rebecca's bed in the dark.

One night, Rebecca woke to find her mother sitting on the edge of her bed, looking more solid than before.

""Why are you doing this?"" Rebecca whispered. ""Why can't you leave me alone?""

""Because you never left us alone,"" her mother answered. ""We're still there, in that kitchen. And so are you.""

""I don't understand.""

""You will,"" her mother said, reaching out as if to touch Rebecca's face, then fading away before contact.

Rebecca stopped going to town. She stopped answering the phone. Food supplies dwindled, but hunger seemed distant and unimportant. Sleep and waking blurred together. Sometimes she'd find herself in rooms with no memory of how she got there, or standing at the shore staring at water for what seemed like hours.

One morning, Rebecca woke up on the beach instead of in her bed. She was holding a shovel, and in front of her was a freshly dug hole. At the bottom lay the silver locket—the same one she'd left here days ago.

""It's time,"" her mother's voice whispered in the wind.

""Time for what?"" Rebecca asked out loud.

""Time to join us.""

Rebecca dropped the shovel and ran back to the cottage, locking doors and windows. She pulled the curtains closed, turned on all the lights. But no matter which room she entered, she found evidence of the past—James's favorite coffee mug on the table, her mother's reading glasses on the counter, a bottle of the lavender perfume in the bathroom.

The cottage was filling up with ghosts. Or maybe the ghosts had always been here, and she was only now able to see them.

She sat on the couch, knees pulled to her chest, watching the door. It was only a matter of time before they came for her. She knew that now.

""I'm not crazy,"" she whispered to herself. ""I'm not crazy.""

But even as she said it, Rebecca understood that maybe crazy people never think they're crazy. Maybe that's part of the problem.

The doorbell rang—a sound she'd never heard before because no one ever visited. When she opened it, there was no one there. Instead, when she turned from the front door, she wasn't in her living room but in the kitchen of her old house.

James stood by the sink, whole and unhurt.

Her mother sat at the kitchen table, no sign of violence on her.

""What's happening?"" Rebecca gasped.

""You made this place,"" James said gently. ""A prison you built yourself.""

""I don't understand.""

Her mother stood up from the table. ""You never left the kitchen, Rebecca. Not really.""

Rebecca looked down to find herself wearing the clothes from that awful day three years ago, still stained with blood.

""No,"" she whispered. ""I got away. I started over.""

James shook his head sadly. ""There is no cottage. No lake. No beach. There's only this kitchen, and what you did here.""

""You've been in a catatonic state since that day,"" her mother explained, her voice surprisingly kind. ""Trapped in your mind while your body sits in a hospital. We've been trying to reach you, to help you find your way back to reality.""

""That's not true!"" Rebecca cried. ""I buried you both! I escaped!""

""Look,"" James said, pointing to the window above the sink.

Rebecca slowly walked over. Instead of seeing the backyard, she saw a plain room where a thin woman sat in a wheelchair, staring at nothing. The woman's face was her own, but older and gaunt. A nurse moved around the room, adjusting equipment, checking vitals.

""This is the real prison,"" her mother said. ""Not the cottage. Not us. Your own mind, punishing you by trapping you in a fake world.""

""I created all of this?"" Rebecca whispered.

""Yes,"" James answered. ""From guilt. From grief. From needing to believe you'd gotten away with it. But part of you always knew the truth. That's why we kept showing up—your conscience trying to break through.""

Rebecca's legs gave out. James caught her before she hit the floor.

""I'm so sorry,"" she cried against his chest. ""I didn't mean to. I loved you both. I was just so angry...""

""We know,"" her mother said, putting a hand on Rebecca's shoulder. ""Now you have a choice. Stay in this fake world where you're always running from ghosts, or face what you did and start to make amends.""

""How?"" Rebecca asked through tears.

""By remembering,"" James said. ""All of it. No more hiding from yourself.""

And suddenly, Rebecca did remember. The full truth crashed through the careful walls her mind had built:

Her mother had been right about James. He had been using her, manipulating her, stealing from her mother. The private investigator had photos, bank records, text messages with other women. The evidence was overwhelming.

But Rebecca hadn't wanted to believe it. She'd built her life around James, invested everything in their relationship. To admit he'd been lying all along was to admit her own foolishness, her own failure.

So when her mother confronted them both in the kitchen that day, showing the evidence, threatening to go to the police about the stolen money, something in Rebecca had snapped.

The knife had been an impulse, a way to stop the words that were destroying her world. Her mother's shock had turned to a strange acceptance in those final moments, as if she'd always known it might come to this.

James hadn't tried to help her mother. He'd tried to get the knife from Rebecca—not out of any concern for her mother, but to protect himself. He knew he'd be the obvious suspect.

""You're going to ruin everything,"" he'd said. Not ""You're killing your mother"" or ""Stop, this is wrong."" Just concern for his own skin.

So she'd turned the knife on him too.

Afterward, she'd been methodical, surprising herself with her own calmness. She'd staged the break-in, disposed of evidence, created an alibi. She'd played the grieving daughter and widow to perfection.

Until the cottage. Until her mind couldn't hold the lies anymore.

""I remember now,"" Rebecca said. ""Everything.""

""Good,"" her mother said. ""That's the first step.""

""What's the next one?""

""Follow us,"" James said, taking her hand. He led her to the kitchen door—a door Rebecca suddenly knew wouldn't lead to the dining room of her old home.

Her mother opened it, revealing bright white light.

""Will it hurt?"" Rebecca asked, stopping at the doorway.

""Yes,"" her mother answered honestly. ""Reality often does. But it's the only way forward.""

""Will you stay with me?"" Rebecca asked. ""On the other side?""

Her mother's face softened. ""We're not really here, Becky. We're just the parts of yourself that have been trying to wake you up. The real us are gone.""

""Then I'll be alone.""

""But you'll be in truth,"" James said. ""No more running.""

Rebecca looked back at the kitchen one last time—where it all happened, where her punishment began. Then she turned, took a deep breath, and stepped through the door with her victims' hands in hers, guiding her back to the truth she had hidden from herself for years.

Light swallowed her, bright and painful. Voices swam around her—unfamiliar ones, excited, professional.

""She's responding!""
""Get Dr. Miller—""
""Look at her EEG—""
""Ms. Morgan? Can you hear me?""

In a hospital room far from any lake, doctors noticed the first conscious movement from Rebecca Morgan in three years—a tear rolling down her cheek, followed by the whispered words: ""I remember.""

Rebecca blinked against harsh fluorescent lighting. The faces above her were strangers, wearing expressions of curiosity and cautious optimism. Beyond them, she could see a bland drop ceiling, medical monitors, the edge of a window showing a city skyline that held no lakes, no forests, no cottages.

""Ms. Morgan, you've been under our care for the past three years,"" a gray-haired doctor was saying. ""You're at Lakeside Memorial Hospital. You've been in a catatonic state, but you're coming back to us now.""

Lakeside. Even here, water found her.

She tried to speak again, but her throat was too dry, her muscles weak from years of disuse. A nurse brought water with a straw, helping her take small sips.

""Your family has been notified,"" the doctor continued. ""They'll be here soon.""

Family? Rebecca had no family left. She'd made sure of that.

But then she remembered—a sister in Arizona. A cousin somewhere on the East Coast. People who would have questions she couldn't answer. Not the truth, anyway.

Or could she? Maybe that was the point of all this. Maybe that's what her mother—what her own mind—had been trying to tell her. No more running. No more lies.

""We'll need to run some tests,"" the doctor was saying. ""But this is remarkable progress.""

Rebecca managed a small nod. They had no idea what progress really looked like—the journey she'd taken from that blood-stained kitchen to this sterile room. The cottage, the lake, the ghosts—all of it constructed in her mind as a hiding place. A beautiful prison she'd built for herself because the truth was too ugly to face.

Outside her window, rain began to fall on the city. Real rain on a real world. Rebecca watched a drop trace its way down the glass, following its path until it disappeared from view.

This was reality—messy, painful, inescapable. No more beaches where problems washed away with the tide. No more forests to hide in. Just consequences, stretching out before her like the hospital corridor visible through her open door.

""Do you understand where you are?"" the doctor asked, checking her cognitive function.

Rebecca turned from the window to meet his eyes. ""Yes,"" she said, her voice stronger now. ""I'm finally home.”",6,1743625592.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

He doesn’t like doing certain things because of sensory issues .

Which I understand being neurodivergent myself.   My boss asked me help him out when I can. So I agreed, I stock  the supply closet which is his agree. Because he doesn’t like the sound of boxes being open.


I also vacuum his hallways  because he doesn’t like the sound of vacuums.  The only thing is, my co-worker is always telling me how much smarter he is than me and how I’m a nobody. 

After a while I wasn’t allowed to speak to him because the sound of my speech impediment hurts his ears. My boss pretty much told me just to ignore him. 

Yesterday he spilled a cup of coffee on my floor after I ran the floor machine. Which cleans my  floor, he told me he didn’t have to clean it up because it wasn’t his floor.

Something broke in me, and I told him I’m no longer helping him out.    He needs to vacuum himself, and do the supply closet.

He broke down crying over it. Now I feel like a jerk. I know my disability isn’t as extreme as his, but I just feel  done over helping him.

by Preston Dennett

Face-to-face contact with a humanoid ET – it’s one of the most astonishing experiences a person can have. And it’s occurring to a huge number of people. It’s been happening across the planet for a very long time. While our governments are now admitting that UFOs are real, they still refuse to talk about humanoids. The question is why? Is it because these kinds of encounters represent the forefront of UFO research and have much to teach us about this subject? This video presents ten incredible cases of face-to-face contact with humanoids. These include multi-witness cases with supporting evidence. The time for truth is now!

A SHOCKING EXPERIENCE. One summer morning in 1948, Ernst-August R. was minding his sheep in a rural area of Hemer, Germany. Suddenly his sheep scattered as a large saucer-shaped craft landed next to him. Ernst reached out and touched it. He was immediately shocked and passed out. Upon awakening, he was surrounded by strange humanoids. They spoke briefly then returned to their craft, which took off, leaving strange landing traces in the field.

A VERY LOUD UFO. One afternoon in July of 1960, railway worker Georges Godbout and his two co-employees were maintaining the tracks of the Canadian National Railroad near Chapais, Quebec, Canada. Suddenly a strange craft appeared over the tracks. It stopped and a humanoid wearing a green bodysuit came out. He started to look around, but seeing the witnesses, promptly returned into the craft. The UFO flew off with such a loud noise that it made the witnesses physically sick.

SPRAYED BY A UFO. On the afternoon of September 30, 1971, Anssi Hakala (age 11) was bicycling to his home in rural Marttila, Finland after visiting a friend. Suddenly a tall, thin, green-skinned humanoid appeared, levitating above his head. Anssi panicked and biked away. The being disappeared into a craft, which then began to pace Anssi on his bike, spraying him with a strange unidentified liquid.

THE LAUGHING ALIENS. At 5:30 pm on September 27, 1973, Antoine X (a mechanic) was out picking edible mushrooms not far from his home in Bedarrides, France. Movement caught his eyes and he observed what he thought were two small children. But they wore fully-body, beige jumpsuits, had very fine features and looked identical. When Antoine called out to them, they laughed and fled into the brush. Moments later, a metallic craft rose up and darted away.

UFO AT A YOUTH CAMP. At 9:30 pm on February 3, 1977, a group of kids from a youth camp at Seven-Mile-Beach in Tasmania, Australia spotted a classic flying saucer hovering at low elevation. It was covered with lights and had several portholes, and through one of the portholes, the children saw a strange humanoid with an oversized head looking down at them.

UFO LANDS AT SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF. At 6:30 pm, Frank Sverre Mandte and Johnny Myrr (both age 11 and deaf) were approaching the Alm’s School near Honefoss, Norway, when they noticed a glowing object at low elevation by the nearby treeline. As they watched, it glided overhead, stopped, and then landed a short distance away. Both boys saw the figure of a humanoid looking down at them. The object took off, leaving behind undeniable landing traces.

ALIENS INSPECT FARMHOUSE. Just before 10pm on August 31, 1978, just as a power-outage struck the area of their home in La Dulce, Argentina, Manuel and Leonor Arias observed an oval craft with portholes hovering near their farm. It then ejected two very short figures with glowing red eyes who glided above the ground, came onto their property, and began to inspect their farm. They stayed for an hour. It was one of more than 20 encounters in the area around that time.

CHASED BY EXTRATERRESTRIALS. At 7:40 pm on September 21, 1978, an anonymous boy was walking through a construction site by his home in Cosenza, Italy when everything around him lit up like daylight. Looking around, he saw a strange craft landed on a nearby hill. A weird humanoid stood on top of it. Suddenly he saw four humanoids bounding towards him. He fainted and when he awoke, he was surrounded by the humanoids, each dressed in jumpsuits and helmets. He tried to fight them, fainted again, and when he awoke, they were gone.

AN ALIEN IN THE YARD. At 10:00 pm on the evening of November 24, 1988, Rune Asplund was drinking coffee in the kitchen his home in Daviken, Sweden when he observed a strange-looking figure just a few feet from his house, in his yard. The figure stood in a strange posture with its arms outstretched and its legs spread widely. It wore an unusual, shiny, metallic jumpsuit. Going outside to get a closer look, he saw the figure disappear into thin air. Rune later learned that a police officer saw a UFO the same night, which caused his cruiser to mysteriously stall. Rune also learned that a year earlier, his neighbor saw a strange, short humanoid, which disappeared the same way.

PLEASE TELL ME I’M NOT CRAZY. It was 1:30 am one night in the summer of 1999 when a fourteen-year-old girl heard a deafening screeching noise right outside the window of her second-story bedroom of her home in Clarksburg, Massachusetts. Looking outside, she saw a strange three-foot-tall being with gray skin, a hairless head and black eyes. Her sister and mother also heard the scream, rushed into the bedroom, and saw it too. The creature remained for fifteen minutes before finally leaving. But it would soon return.

These ten incredible humanoid encounters show how very strange face-to-face contact can be. And these ten accounts represent just a small portion of the true number of encounters. So many cases. So many types of humanoids. So much evidence! The time for skepticism is now over. We are being visited by aliens.

STARGAZING (beat switch is one of the greatest things i’ve ever heard, both beats are incredible and travis excels on them both, i just love this song)

2. SKELETONS (you can practically smell the kanye west influence radiating off of this song, beautiful production, the weeknd and travis fit the song perfectly, just a great song)

3. CAN’T SAY (don toliver ft is incredible, beat great, travis part good, my favorite before sitting down and listening to the whole album at once)

4. WHO? WHAT! (might be a hot take but i love the beat and the inclusion of migos, plus one of travis’s better rapping performances on the album)

5. ASTROTHUNDER (heavenly beat and instrumentals, chill vibe from travis, WHY ISN’T IT LONGER)

6. SICKO MODE (THE astroworld song. the beginning is incredible, the beat switch is great, and a solid performance from drake, who i normally hate on)

7. COFFEE BEAN (really enjoy beat, ending instrumentals fit beautifully, good lyrics and delivery)

8. STTBG (great message and incredible second half but harmonica honestly hurt my ears at the very very end)

9. BUTTERFLY EFFECT (its a vibe but its too short honestly, could have used a little more oomph)

10. WAKE UP (not the best performance from the weeknd or travis but the end segment was great)

11. YOSEMITE (gunna performed amazingly on this beat, travis did okay, i dont like nav, beat feels a little empty)

12. NO BYSTANDERS (juice met my expectations on my initial listen, travis had a decent verse, sheck wes was there i guess)

13. CAROUSEL (had me with the first minute or so but i feel like frank ocean is out of place)

14. 5% TINT (pretty good beat and beautiful outro but it almost felt like it was slowly building up to something that never came)

15. NC-17 (pretty solid beat, 21 very fit well on the song, just not my thing)

16. HOUSTONFORNICATION (felt like it was lacking something but it’s hard to pinpoint, i’m just not a fan of this one)

17. R.I.P. SCREW (nothing makes it stand out to me all that much compared to rest of album)

Pursuing IB (super niche pick I know 😅). After a decent bit of coffee chats with people from my university (all the people I spoke to have internships or are starting full time in IB soon), one of the general pieces of advice given to me was to gain as much knowledge about the industry and markets and also familiarize myself with IB and its technicals. Do you guys recommend any book/textbooks that cover the broader knowledge of the industry and also maybe a book about markets and finance as a whole? Also looking for a book that focus more on the technicals and ins and outs, but im already leaning towards Rosenbaum and Pearl for that.

1jpyqur,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/1jpyqur/dude_this_shit_works/,Dude this shit works!!,"I am just so happy... I started this lifestyle change on 3/24 the day after my birthday. I had been so tired all the time, feeling so overweight for my normal, comfortable body, sleeping like shit and on the couch because of my snoring and just so sore everywhere, and just all around not a nice person to be around because of my own misery. After some time lurking this sub and gathering as much info about other people on their journey, different tactics that work and don't work and looking to other men about my size with similar goals, I committed to the change. I've never really done much to keep my weight down other than a shift in diet and exercise that I never really stick to. And I've done keto in the past and my body responded extremely well to that so I know what it takes for myself to get the numbers on the scale to start moving downward. So I came up with a system that I knew would work for me and my daily life, a 17:7 schedule (Noon to 7pm eating hours) with a high-protein/low-carb focus and no drinking. Dropping alcohol was not really a big deal for me, I just really enjoy beer so I will find myself having one tall craft can pretty much every day... Never enough to really catch too much of a buzz but just for the enjoyment of a cold one at the end of my day. You know, just so many empty calories. I stopped drinking sugary sodas a long time ago and switched to sparkling water and ""zero"" sodas to scratch that sugary, sweet itch. And quite a while ago I switch to black coffee also so my beverage consumption was already pretty clean and already included tons of water daily. The biggest shift is dropping beer, which once I hit my goal weight I will probably stop being so strict with myself about it, but may switch to something like a Corona Premier or something to satisfy that desire for a brew while keeping close to my new lifestyle path. I'm really trying to stay away from anything that had too much processing before it gets to me. So I'm eating pistachios and raw almonds when I want to snack, tons of eggs, lots of chicken and veggies, switched out standard rice for riced cauliflower which is a nice switch, and added a protein shake into the mix most days too. The only exceptions to this 'anti-processed' intention is probably the high protein noodles I'll fuck with when I do have a carb-y meal, and the daily beef stick i have too... Jalapeno Chomps are just too fucking good. Sorry, not sorry. The past few days my 17:7 schedule has just naturally shifted to a 19:5 schedule (holding out until 2pm to break the fast) and I'm not feeling overly hungry or tired which was a surprise at first. I feel just awesome. Light and alert and focused. Not bogged down by whatever bullshit snack i just had or feeling like i didn't get enough sleep... probably because I'm not choking all night trying to get enough air in my sleep. 



I am happy to report that as of yesterday I weighted in at 224lbs and that has held through today so I know its legit loss. And I just want to say thanks to everyone on here who shares about your own progress. It inspired me to take a long look at myself and my late-night snacking habits and how those habits were affecting my life and how I've been feeling everyday. I've told everyone about this shift I'm taking on so that the people I love and care about will hold me accountable to this shift in lifestyle. My wife can't wait for me to come back to sleeping in our bed, my friends are rooting for me and my kids are just seeing that I am happier and have more patience and energy for them and their shenanigans. This is not temporary for me, I know people that have all-time committed to an IF schedule and are fit and healthy and I see that I just need to be in that space too.

Then suddenly, she looks down at my body (I was wearing a very loose dress, deliberately hiding my small bump) and said really loudly ""WOW I've just realized you're pregnant, congratulations!"". I haven't told anyone at work I'm pregnant yet, except for my boss who I told because I had to get time off for appointments. I specifically asked him not to tell people. 

Is it just me or is this completely inappropriate?! I would never assume someone is pregnant unless they told me or maybe if they were really about to pop and wearing clothes that showed off the bump?! I had to tell my colleague ""shhh, I haven't told anyone yet"" - wasn't quick enough to think of a random excuse/ clever answer.

Then later the same day I have a meeting with my boss, at the end he tells me that he hasn't told anyone else, but says ""you are starting to show though, so you should probably tell everyone soon"". Also not okay?!!! He might be right, I am getting bigger, but I'll tell people when I'm ready... Boss also knows I had a loss last year because I had to take time off while I was in the hospital, surely he could understand I want to wait a bit longer to tell people and then have to talk about my pregnancy (which I'm really anxious about) all the time at work

I usually get me and my four year old up at 9am but today I woke up from 3am-5am so I intended to get my toddler up and fed at 9 and get some activity to keep her occupied for about 30-45 minutes and then I was going to sleep just alittle longer. When I woke back up from my nap at 11:30 I thought “I still need to give myself my lantus” so I went ahead and did it but I usually have foot to floor syndrome in the mornings (which also helps my remember to take my lantus) but my blood sugar wasn’t going up at all by 11:30 so I started to question if I had already given myself my lantus when I first woke up at 9 and I just don’t remember. After I gave myself my insulin I was going down alittle so I made myself an iced coffee and had a powdered sugar donut and decided to wait until I wasn’t dropping anymore to give myself my insulin. Well I watched it for a while, I had slowly jumped up  to 220 and then started to head back down but I never gave myself fast acting for my food. And that’s where I’m kinda fucked up because the night before I ran low a lot, usually I don’t lower my lantus the next mornings after a night like that, I’ll wait until the following day if I’m low all night again to lower it one unit just incase it was a weird night.  So l didn’t lowered it today so I could be going down because of that but I’m also not 100% sure if I double dosed my lantus 🤦🏻‍♀️ 
Now my question if I’m not getting too high (like lower then 230) after my meals, and I’m lowering on my own within an hour am I still risking like dka or anything if I end up not needing insulin because I accidentally double dosed my lantus? Or would it be better to give myself insulin for my meals and then just correct with juice all day if I do get low? ",1,1743624845.0,diabetes_t1,1,1.0,False

I’m not in need of a lot of money right now, just to pay off my small amount of expenses as I still live at home and I don’t want a job that has too much stress or responsibilities as I want my focus to be on my classes.

However, I worked at a popular coffee chain for a few years and had developed a lot in the company before realizing management wasn’t really for me. I went from barista to shift supervisor to assistant store manager within the span of 2 years so I obviously had all of that on my resume. 

Since I recently had gone back to school to pursue something more within my interests, I’ve been looking for these “normal” non-management jobs and thought having my past experience on my CV would give me a better chance, for example I’ve applied to a few local cafes to be a barista but I haven’t heard back at all. I have lots of coffee knowledge and experience on top of many years of customer service experience, so I’m wondering if coincidentally these places just weren’t hiring or I may seem too “overqualified” for a normal barista job. 

My question is, should I remove all the management duties from my CV and just leave the stuff that’s relevant to being a barista,whatever else I apply for? I’m planning on reworking my CV to highlight that I’m looking for a job while I’m in school as kind of like an explanation of why I would be randomly looking for these types of jobs despite my management experience, but I’m thinking I should just remove it entirely or just put the job titles. What do you think? 

Any and all advice is appreciated, thanks in advance! ",2,1743624717.0,resumes,3,0.75,False
